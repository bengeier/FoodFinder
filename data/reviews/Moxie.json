{"text":"Good.  Noisy space.  Busy, lots of teenagers in formal wear - prom dinner destination?  Too many fried items on the menu.  But given the choices in the neighborhood, an excellent alternative."}
{"text":"I took someone here for a work lunch since I've heard such great things about it.  What a disappointment.  We were seated in the bar area, which is fine, because we were told  that the server up there \"was bored.\"  When you hear that you think you'll get exceptional service.  Wow, was that NOT the case and it wasn't even that crowded in the entire restaurant.  Our server was impossible to find and when he did come around he was very short/rude.  Our food took roughly 40 minutes to come out to us.  When it did arrive the fries were ice cold and the fish tacos were a little warm.  We couldn't find our server to get refills or the check or a box for leftovers (not that they were even good enough to take home).  All in all, we were there for an hour and 30 minutes for LUNCH!! I am in no hurry to go back, to say the least."}
{"text":"Disappointing. 

First time at Moxie. Overall food quality did not match up to expensive price tag. Shrimp cocktail starter was delicious and the saving grace for the otherwise mediocre meal. Calamari decent but no better than at chain like brio or bravo. My husband had the rib eye which was simple and under seasoned. I had the tuna with coconut sticky rice - could only taste the sesame crust on the tuna and sticky rice was a fried cube of mush with hint of coconut flavor. I've never sent food back in my life but unfortunately had to with the tuna. Just not worth eating. My tuna was replaced with the salmon which was ok but not worth $30. 
Had the hot chocolate dessert which was excellent.

Wine list was overpriced compared to quality of food. Our server recommended a few bottles in $70-100 price range but so glad we didn't go for those since food wouldn't have matched up. 

Overall, if you're going to spend a couple hundred for a nice dinner, go next door to Red steakhouse instead."}
{"text":"Two of us dined here for lunch on 7-22-16. Service was excellent. The staff was very attentive and friendly. One entrée was the walleye which was pretty good. the other entrée was the salmon which was very, very dry. We had two appetizers, the shrimp cocktail and deviled eggs with smoked salmon. They were tiny. Three egg halves for around $10=overpriced. It was a bit off putting that an employee came into the kitchen area to show off his newborn to the staff. Granted, the restaurant was nearly empty but it was still business hours. Glad we know what Moxie is about but won't be back."}
{"text":"Such a fantastic way to start Easter. Went with friends. Food was great, service was great as always. Mmmm....great brunch. Will be back for the next one."}
{"text":"How this place can average 3.5 stars is beyond me.  Been going here since they opened, on and off over the years....NEVER had a bad meal.  Excellent, polite, knowledgeable staff, but not snobby.  Visited here recently for my son's birthday and as usual, it was excellent.  Filet was perfectly cooked, melted in my mouth, and the suggest wine was a perfect pairing.  Don't be afraid to go out of your comfort zone to try something new here, you wont be disappointed!!  Everyone needs to try baked hot chocolate once in their life!!!

This is my go-to place for an excellent meal."}
{"text":"Despite making reservations ahead of time was seated at the bar, where the service is slower as the bartender has to cover tables as well as tend bar. Had TVs at the bar to distract you while you wait to be waited on. Went for lunch, the crowd definitely thins out after 1:00. The decor is very trendy, the automobiles in the parking lot very expensive.
Had the duck confit and Caesar salad ($3.50 additional charge). The salad was good, but no whole anchovies. The duck confit was outstanding. The salmon was very good as well. The strawberry shortcake parfait was okay, the shortbread was a little stale."}
{"text":"Had the deviled eggs with salmon for an appetizer, followed by the Moxie burger. Food was above average, but so was the pricing. Seems to be a popular spot for the suit & tie crowd; lots of upper end cars in the parking lot. Waiter was pleasant but food takes a while. I ordered at 5:30 when dinner started and did not get my food until 6:05."}
{"text":"It was meh. I ordered a fried pork belly salad with Blue cheese. I substituted mixed greens for the awful iceberg & yet they smothered my lettuce in Blue cheese dressing. I guess it's my fault for thinking it would be crumbled Blue cheese in lieu of creamy messy dressing. And 3 pieces of pork belly wasn't enough. Oh well. 1st & last time for everything."}
{"text":"I had heard good things about Moxie, so I was looking forward to our first visit.  My wife and I were meeting a friend who travels into town for the holidays, and we always get together for lunch to catch up and enjoy a special meal.
We knew things were headed in the wrong direction when, although we had a reservation, we had to wait 20 minutes to be seated.  20 minutes is an awfully long time to wait for a lunch setting, particularly with a small party like ours.  Eventually we were seated in a table in the back of the main room, near the door to the outside...very drafty (and downright brutal whenever the door was opened).  
About 10 minutes after we were seated, we flagged down a waiter to let them know we had not yet been helped.  He brought us bread, and let us know that they were out of both the soup of the day and the lunch special.  He then took our orders and refilled our drinks.
After another 20 minutes with no sign of our lunch, we again flagged down our waiter to see if he could at least bring the soup that 2 of us had ordered.  He explained that the steak for one of our steak salads had been burned, and was being remade, but he would bring the soup.  
When the meals did come out, it was clear that the salad had been dressed and sitting while the meat was re-cooked...the greens were wilted and the noodles and cashews were soggy.  On the positive side, my duck confit with pumpkin pudding was very good.  
Our waiter felt bad for our experience, so he offered us a desert... to share.
I don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"Moxie is a consistently high quality restaurant whether you prefer meat, fish, or pasta.The menu is periodically updated to keep it fresh and the preparations are usually excellent. It's a bit pricey and sometimes hard to get into without a reservation, but this remains one of the most consistent restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I wish that I could give no stars. This used to be my ultimate favorite restaurant. Unfortunately, it has gone way downhill. I just visited there yesterday, and the food was horrible. I should have sent it back and not paid for it.  The field greens were not fresh, and very limp. I asked for chicken with it and it was so dry that I started choking. I think it was leftover from the night before. The ahi tuna was not fresh and tasted like it was several days old. It made my Mom and I sick.  The service was non- existent. They didn't even give us bread. The hostess was miserable and incredibly condescending. I realize that we should have had reservations, but that is not a reason for poor quality food, poor service and nasty hostess. She tools us that the bar was reserved but after she overheard me mumble something to my Mother, she seated us at a booth in the bar. The place was empty so I don't understand the obsession with reservations. This is, by far, not an exclusive place. Also the hostess should stop being so rude.  She is no better than anyone else.  I feel saddened to write this review because I really loved this restaurant and looked forward to eating there when I visit Cleveland to visit my parents. The food used to be amazing, but now it is horrible and I will never go back.  I am telling all my friends to stay away."}
{"text":"We frequent Moxie often for special occasions and just because occasions. We've had several menu items and we are never disappointed in the quality. Generally speaking, portions are small for entrees, but for sides they are generous.

 A few tips. Call ahead and request the corner booths by the window. They are large and cozy. Each have a heater behind the back too for added coziness for the CLE winters. 

In summers, they have a nice patio as well.

The tuna app is excellent generally speaking. One time I ordered it it was already cold, but since it's prepared mid rare that's not terribly unusual. The \"sticky rice\" that comes with that app is tremendous too.

The ribeye is always good (helps that Red is a sister restaurant) and is always on the menu- same with the filet. I've had the short ribs before and they were excellent. Caesar salad is really good as well. Bread and butter is good as well.

We most recently visited yesterday for our anniversary ordered the crab dip, caesar salad, ribeye, and the ship entree. Got out of there for about 130 dollars."}
{"text":"Well this isn't so much a review as an experience. Made resos a few days in advance, showed up a little early and was seated by a table near the bar. That was the best part of my experience there.

Then our server didnt show up. About 15 minutes in I stood by the half empty bar watching the bartender chat someone up for 5 more minutes. Finally he came over and asked if he could help. I put in an order for 2 drinks and he told me we should order them from our server. So 20 minutes in I watched two servers and the hostess point at us from near the kitchen and argue, hopefully about which one was going to come to our table. Then they all went their separate ways. So almost half an hour in we walked out the door. The hostess asked us \"how was it?\". I said I have no idea. 

Then we went Paladar and had an awesome dinner an hour later than anticipated. Just go there is my recommendation."}
{"text":"Went for the first time in a few years. Food was mediocre at best. We had the calamari appetizer, B &E chicken and crusted walleye. None of these were anything other than ordinary. Service was friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Was just a terrible experience,we had reservations at 8 pm. Walked in at 745 and were told our table we be ready in a few minutes.We decided to go sit in the bar for a drink,noone ever came to get a drink order ,had to go to the bar and order a drink.At 845 I went back up to the hostess desk to ask what is going on with our table and the hostess forgot about us.at 9 pm and hour after our reservation we were finally seated. We ordered 2 salmon dinners and the tomato bisque,the soup came out promptly ,had good flavor and was hot,as far as the salmon went we waited about an hour for them and was told that one of our salmons was dropped in the kitchen,after it finally came out they brought one fresh cooked salmon and one that was sitting for nearly an hour waiting for the other one to cook.The one sitting was dried out and over cooked and wasn't really good anymore. Overall the evening was a mess from the beginning and was never approached by a manager,seems to be Moxie feels that decorating your dinner plate with spinach and other leafy vegetables is going make the food taste good,they should really just get back to basics and serve a good properly cooked item in a timely fashion and have service that compliments it. Management wasn't present and the salmon should've been addressed and checked by management before being sent out."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant when I come to Cleveland to visit my parents. The service is outstanding and the food is beyond delicious.  My Mom and I went there for lunch last week and had salads and appetizers. The salad was out of this world. We had the calamari, the dates and the ahi tuna.  Everything was delicious, fresh and well prepared. The ahi tuna was perfect.

I didn't love the sauce on the calamari, but the calamari itself was delicious.  I always come to Moxi's for lunch and/or dinner when I come to visit. Moxie never disappoints."}
{"text":"Mighty Mighty Moxie.

Moxie is one of the best places around for straight up original interesting food. Trying something new & diifferent for the love of flavor is what this place is about. I can see Chef Bennett on top chef one of these days, because he gets it... although i really do not want him to be absent from the mox!

I go here pretty frequently & am always impressed. This last Friday I went and was WOWED. Sommelier Cyrus & Chef Bennett did a special tasting event with Syrahs and Petite Sirahs - and Bennett cooked right there on the spot for the pairings. I mean wow. Lets face it, any decent sommelier can do a pairing, but these two really just hit it out of the park. And to have the chef cooking while you graze & where you can ask questions (or try to steal his secret ingregdients) was just way way cool. I mean dude! Man! Give me more of that! 

If you want to really experience good pairings, go to one of the wine dinners. You won't be disappointed - unless you have a dead palate.

Thanks Moxie for staying mighty mighty!"}
{"text":"Located next to sister restaurant Red steakhouse you can't go wrong with either option. 
The interior decor is a little dated. The service is excellent and the food is predictably well prepared and presented. Excellent wine list. 
The restaurant is slightly more formal and expensive than average."}
{"text":"Had a bad experience...real bad.  Service non-existent. fumbling, bumbling. When salad finally came, couldn't figure out what it was.... it consisted of 5 teeny bits of cheese with 4 crumbs of plain not candied walnut (had to total 1/2 walnut), a few slices of sour apple that was paper thin, and very bitter endive with a small piece of chicken which seemed undercooked.  This was the strangest \"salad\" (?)  I have ever seen.....it was nasty tasting...and I'm never going back. Who is managing this place?! Such awful tasting food and combinations. Left hungry and dissatisfied and ripped-off."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to this place.  My fiancee and I went for Valentine's Day dinner on a 7 p.m. reservation.  First, we had expected some sort of special prix fixe menu for the holiday from an establishment of this caliber.  The specials that were offered were unfortunately somewhat disappointing, so we both ended up ordering off of the menu.

My fiancee tried to order the Mediterranean Sea Bass, but was informed that it \"wasn't like Chilean Sea Bass,\" it was served \"tail on\" and the most people were \"scared away.\"  Not wanting to be scared, she opted for the Flat Iron Steak.

I had hoped to enjoy the Lobster Macaroni & Cheese, a dish I remember fondly from having dined at Moxie in its better days.  Unfortunately, it was nowhere to be found.  Instead, I took the waitress up on the salmon she had tried to suggest to my fiancee in place of her sea bass.

Our starters (calamari, crab cakes) were decent, but our mains were nothing to write home about.  The salmon was flavorful but unimpressive, and the flat iron steak was bland (even at medium).  For thirty dollars each (just for the entrees) we felt we could do much better elsewhere in town (It would be worth driving out to Lakewood for Players on Madison)

When it came time for dessert, I was pleasantly surprised to see a peppermint/chocolate dish called the \"Baked Alaskan\" - a brownie with peppermint ice cream and marshmallow meringue.  When it arrived, the meringue had been torched until rock solid, and the peppermint ice cream was avocado-colored and tasted faintly of cucumbers.  My fiancee promptly informed me that I could have done a better job with the dish myself (likely true) and, thankfully, allowed me to share her black-bottomed cheesecake.

The final blow comes to the treatment of our wine.  We had ordered a $56 bottle, planning to take the remainder home under Ohio's relatively new laws requiring restaurants to recork the unfinished portion.  When we asked to have the wine re-corked, our waitress informed us that she had lost the screwtop, and suggested that we ride home with our finger in the bottle!  I'm sure this was meant to be funny, but it really wasn't.  She scrounged up a cork from another bottle (wrong size) and put the wine in a vastly oversized bag.  Not only was the cork the wrong size, but it was stained with red wine and a poor match for our white blend.

In a city with as many fabulous restaurants as Cleveland, don't settle on $90/head mediocrity.  You just don't need to patronize Moxie anymore."}
{"text":"Great location for a business lunch. Excellent service. Calamari was very good. Conveniently located in the suburbs and close to major roads. Great dessert selection.  I was told that the burgers are good, but I had the fish special (bronzini with brussel sprouts), which was delicious. I would definitely go back the next time that I am in the area."}
{"text":"Moxie is a great place to eat and grab a drink! However, I can't advocate for their Easter brunch. At $39.50 per adult, the selection is limited and are things you can get at any run-of-the mill breakfast locale for 20-25% of the cost. Choices were incredibly limited (beef, ham, omelets to order, vegetables, fruit, bacon, potatoes, and sausage gravy) but nothing that leapt out and said \"this is special.\" Food tasted great, but I was expecting a wow factor that we didn't get. Next time we'll try Flour."}
{"text":"The food was good but the portions are inconsistent. My salmon entree was half the size it was last time I was there. Also, I asked for a little extra veggie instead of rice but that didn't happen :-(. The service was fine but definitely nothing to \"write home about\". Lastly, the restaurant needs some serious updating -- the wood in our booth was literally peeling off and when the lights are turned up you can see that the whole room is flaking and dull. Time to give Moxie a makeover! I like this restaurant but it does need to make some improvements."}
{"text":"I come here on a semi-regular basis (once every month or so) with my girlfriend and use a $25 restaurant.com gift certificate each time.  The service is really hit or miss depending on your waiter.  I've generally had attentive service, but a couple times I've seen our waiter standing around in the open kitchen while we're waiting for him to bring us more bread or water.  The food is pretty good, the burger is enormous and a good value while the steaks are okay in both taste and value.  

I would give the place 4 stars, but the last time I went something happened that bumps the place down to 3.  The hostess seated a party down at a table and the waitstaff poured waters for everyone.  That party was then moved to another table by request about 5 minutes later.  About 20 minutes after that, a second party was seated at that same original table with the water and silverware unchanged.  I do not know for certain whether any member of the original party drank the water or touched the silverware, but I was a bit concerned that they didn't clear up the table before seating a new party.  It wasn't until we mentioned it to the waitstaff was the table cleaned."}
{"text":"I was not impressed by Moxie which I find depressing because  I know they also own Red, The Steakhouse and that place is fantastic! 

Our waiter had a dull personality and didn't seem to be around much. After discussing this place with my friends they all seemed to have the same reaction about the service. Service is extremely important to me. You can have good food but with so-so service I may never return.

The one fantastic thing about Moxie is the magnificent butter that they serve with the bread! I want to have a whole tub of that at my house! I ordered the Lamb Ragu which was cooked perfectly. The food options are okay but something about this place (besides the service) just doesn't impress me."}
{"text":"First off it was hard to find.  It took me quite a bit of time to figure out if this place was Reds or Moxie or both.  Are they going through a name change?

I'm from out of town and was looking for a good steak.  I ordered the 8oz filet.  It was a little undercooked but delicious.  I didn't like the side choice options.  I had to choose mashed potatoes.

The bartender was competent but a bit slow and rather curt.  They charged me $2.00 extra for ice in my drink \"on the rocks\".  That left an unnecessary mark on my experience.

Parking was more difficult than I thought it should be.  Valet had like 5 cars out in the lot just sitting there running.  I knew at that point to skip valet.

Dessert options were paltry so I decided against it this time.  Red wine selection by the glass was poor.

After all that I doubt I'll be back any time soon."}
{"text":"Over priced.  Went with a girlfriend on July 5 and we each ordered the fish special.  She received a fillet of fish, I received 3 dry pieces laid out together to look like a fillet.  We each had 2 drinks and both bills were $60, that's ridiculous for dry left-over fish arranged to look like a fillet. 
Pathetic, won't be back."}
{"text":"Moxie is a real gem.  We went for drinks and dinner on a Friday night.  Kristine Jackson live doing acoustic guitar blues and classic rock covers was a perfect accompaniment to a fabulous, intimate meal.

The bar serves expertly-made cocktails, on- or off-menu.  The Blood and Sand was a favorite.

We had frites as an appetizer, perfectly crisp and salty.  Seared tuna and an amazing roasted cauliflower and kale salad with salmon.  I'm a carnivore but I think I could eat the cauliflower salad every day.  Oh my god, the bread and whipped butter with oils were worth the visit alone.

Our server, Paul, was maybe the best server we've ever had.  He saw us enjoying our bread and frites, and told us to just give him the sign when we wanted our mains submitted.  He was so attentive and yet stayed in the background and assured us that we should stay and relax and that there was no hurry to turn the table.  Fantastic service, thanks Paul!

Moxie is a great place to have a special meal, good food and drinks, and dress up a bit and feel special."}
{"text":"Two words: happy hour.

I had a seasonal mojito, husband got a beer, and we got three apps and a salad and dessert for like 40 dollars. It was amazing!

Please get the guac with salmon. The salmon changes the guac flavor so much and it is amazing. I don't know if I will ever want normal guac again. The mini chicken sliders were great and the homemade chips were great too.  The tomato flatbed was good as well.

For dessert we got the creme brûlée donuts and they were essentially donuts stuffed with custard and topped with burnt sugar. Delicious! 

Atmosphere is classy and service was great. I will be back next time I am in town."}
{"text":"I was here way back when they first opened and have been here a few times in the last couple months. They generally have strong apps and salads. The kale and date salad is warm with a peppered bacon and quite tasty. Sesame tuna was quite good as well with a sticky coconut rice that I really enjoyed. 

I had a scallop dish with a mustard spaetzle. It was good but not great and a little small for $27. The steak frites looked much better and next time I will get those. This place is unusually busy all the time and it boggles my mind that they have to do valet parking here when it is in a typical plaza parking situation. I find it a little annoying personally and try to avoid paying $4 and waiting in line for your car to come back for what appears to be absolutely no reason."}
{"text":"This used to be a favorite place for quality, seasonal food and good service. Had a business lunch Friday 12/2/16 we ordered simple food that was well below par for this restaurant. I had a hamburger that was half the size it used to be. That wasn't so bad but with the sauce and flavored grilled onions it had so many conflicting flavors it was terrible - don't know what the chef is thinking.  Chicken with salad was dried out according to other dining partner.  On top of all this the waiter asked us to pay the bill so he could leave to go to his second job at another restaurant down the road!"}
{"text":"Wow awesome! Great food. Extremely professional servers. Nice atmosphere. The only reason they do not get five stars is no gluten free menu. Very nice overall."}
{"text":"Having been in the food service industry for over 6 years, I only expect the basics. Moxie FAILS at the basics, and should be avoided at all costs. I sat down at the bar at 555pm today, only to have the gentleman I THOUGHT was the bartender ignore me, while he counted bottles (even though he made contact with me many times).  After another 5 minutes, a surely woman (presumably the bartender), asked me, \"what do you want to drink?  Beer?  Wine?  You need a list?\"  I ordered a beer, and asked for a food menu;  though still happy hour, she threw me the regular menu. Over the course of the next 20 minutes, she greeted other bar patrons, when not obsessed with tending to tables outside, offering them suggestions, the regular menu, and the happy hour menu. Knowing I was not her concern, I placed my CC on the bar to pay my tap.  though she looked directly at my card and me 4 times, she never uttered a word. 20 minutes later, I approached the hostess and asked for contact info for a corporate  rep. as my experience was beyond horrible. I know the restaurant is upscale, but I do drive a Mercedes, and was dressed in Burberry London attire. To receive basic respect, the car I drive nor the label of my attire should matter as long as I am presentable. I will not return to Moxie, advise others to dine there, nor ever schedule one of my monthly events. I drove down the street to CM Fish Market, and had a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Inventive menu with outstanding service, stiff drinks and lively atmosphere make Moxie one of the deservedly most popular east side eateries in the Cleveland area.  Attached at the hip to its younger sister (they share common kitchen and restrooms), this duo whops a powerful punch."}
{"text":"It's like a non-franchised JAlexander, etc.  Food was great and we were there for a private party and they did a great job and the quality of the food spread and wine choices were solid.

Swanky interior and nice staff."}
{"text":"Well, I'm back to Yelping.  I really didn't have anything to Yelp about.  Until now...  My wife and my anniversary was 9/16.  Not being the most astute \"man about town\" we haled our Facebook friend base for suggestions for a celebratory dinner.  While we had several suggestions, one place was mentioned several times...Moxie.

Ambiance - I was expecting something stuffy but was pleasantly surprised by open ceilings, sleek metal on wood decor, with an exposed kitchen area.  The kitchen was a beehive of 20 something chefs making it all happen.  Very nice vibe..!

Service - This is a reservations are needed kind of place.  We were greeted very pleasantly and seated promptly.  Our most excellent waitress, Stacey, helped us navigate the unfamiliar menu with great care and without condescension.  They also presented the flowers (that I ordered previously) to my wife with sincerity for our celebration. Just the right amount of attention was paid to us while we dined.

Food - Whoa!  My wife and I both commented how everything on our plate BURST with flavor.  While not subtle the flavors weren't overpowering and added to the very vivid taste experience.  I had perfectly prepared scallops!  At the time I didn't notice what my wife had.  I'm afraid I had already strapped on the feed bag.  However, She did say her halibut was indeed fantastic. As an appetizer we had the calamari.  We both declared it was the best we ever had.  The dessert came \"on the house\" which was a nice touch. It was a piping hot brownie in a cup with chilled whipped cream on top.  I'm not much of a dessert guy, but his was gooooood.

Value - Eh.. I would have liked to spend less,  but not at the expense of the great experience.  It's not an everyday thing for me and for those in my tax bracket, but I was not in least disappointed.  No buyer's remorse here!  We'll be back for the next VERY special occasion."}
{"text":"4 stars for what it is; a New American/American steakhouse with good meat dishes. 

It's tucked away in one of the strip malls in the burbs. I think once we entered the restaurant, it felt less strip mall-ish for sure! I think the best part of our evening was the service. Our server was really attentive, always filling our cups with water, and giving us good advice about what to order. It was clear that he really enjoyed his job.

We went on a Monday night. At first it was slow, and then more people started to come around 7pm. 

I ordered a few pescetarian-friendly dishes, like the crab cakes (small plates) and the risotto (medium plate). The crab cakes were a bit too fried and greasy for my taste, so having 1-2 felt enough. I ate them all anyway! The risotto was pretty good, and definitely very filling. 

My friend ordered the bourbon-maple pork chop. This is where moxie does it good. I sampled the brussel sprouts (yum!! cooked perfectly) and the polenta (good texture and taste.) I did sneak a bit of the pork chop, and it was really really juicy. The pork chop was huge! We didn't leave anything left untouched though."}
{"text":"We went for my grandmothers birthday the Friday after Thanksgiving . There were pluses and minuses of the restaurant. It's nice inside, nice atmosphere. The calamari me shared was excellent. My mom had the crab dip as her meal and it was overly fishy tasting. I had the short rib which was disappointing. My grandma enjoyed the mussels and my dad loves the duck confit. The pumpkin bread pudding that came with the Duck was great and ended up being what I primarily ate. The time between our appetizer and meals coming out was crazy. We were seated at 6:50 and our main course did not show up until 8:45. They do did provide my grandma with a great dessert for her birthday which they allowed us to pick out. Our waiter was very friendly. It is was a fine experience but somewhere I would go back to. Too many amazing restaurants in Cleveland to have a mediocre meal. Also not cheap."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Moxie (about 8 years ago) I was not pleased and I honestly can't remember why. I finally went back about a week ago and holy smokes do I love this place. I'm mad at myself for ever having a negative thought about this place!

I had the poached pear martini and it came with a candy rock stick!!! I was pretty giddy about it not ganna lie.

Their salads were delicious. I got the Caesar and tried my friend's house salad and both were excellent. We split the butternut squash soup and I'm pretty sure we were both licking the bowl clean. 

In celebration, I had the filet mignon. It was tender, juicy, cooked perfectly, flavorful and came with a tasty pasta & kale combo. My mouth is watering just reminiscing about it. 

I can't wait to go back and try more dishes and experiment with some more of their awesome martinis.

**recommend making a reservation."}
{"text":"Went with wife for her birthday.  Service was fine.  She had ahi tuna which was very good.  I had the duck breast which was served in a metal pan with a spicy noodle/cabbage mix.  There was no sauce on the duck.  There was a lukewarm half cooked egg in the pan.  The temperature of the pan was not that hot when it arrived at the table.  I did not like the spicy noodle cabbage part of the dish and a lukewarm half cooked egg as a sauce for duck just didn't make it.

So, fortunately for me, my wife had a dish she liked for her birthday and the overall experience was fine, but I would not recommend the spicy Korean style duck. (by the way this is not the duck dish that is on their on line menu."}
{"text":"I went with two people who LOVE Moxie. My hopes were high. I found it to be overpriced, with subpar service, and \"meh\" food. It wasn't bad by any means, it just wasn't special in my opinion. Sorry, friends! 

Seems like business lunch-central. On a weekday, the people at my table were the only ones not wearing suits! And the place was packed. I'll leave it to the businessmen and women. 

The patio was very nice, though full of bees. It was a bzzzzz-y Thursday afternoon for Moxie."}
{"text":"I went here with my girlfriend when she first moved here to go to med school.  I looked high and low for a fine dining restaurant and finally settled on Moxie.  

Not having a reservation we were lucky to get a table, this place gets pretty crowded on weekends.  To be safe I suggest making a reservation.

The restaurant has a wide selection of wines by the glass and artesian cheese to pair with said wines.  The food is well prepared with a touch more elan than I find in most Cleveland restaurants.

If you want to impress a date or business client Moxie fits the bill perfectly."}
{"text":"Excellent food, good portions, great servers. Wine list and dessert list had wide varieties. 10 person party with drinks and dessert was $665. Not bad for a 2.5 hour stay."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong... I like Moxie. Trendy decor. Well stocked bar. Young active, friendly, and committed staff. I even like the \"visible cuisine\" thing, so I can watch all the staff hang around the pass.

What I don't like is when a place like this misses. It's particularly annoying when I get almost all the way, then fall short, and pay top dollar for the privilege.

It started with a rye Manhattan. Right off the cocktail menu, made with Bulleit, it was watery, shaken, and cost $14. These days it's ok to shake a Martini, but please stir my Manhattan. Give it to me in a glass that fits, so I think I'm getting something, and make it taste good. (yes! I'm being snarky. But it was a $14 cocktail, dammit!)

The bread, which is very good, was served with a butter and olive oil confection that would have been awesome if the olive oil was superb. But no.

I decided to have the current restaurant week menu. Very reasonably priced at $33 for a blackened shrimp app, braised short rib, and orange pot de creme. Everything is lovingly presented.

The shrimp was plated with avocado, and citrus. I love grapefruit, and honor it whenever I get it on a plate. So, I really enjoyed the contrast between the avocado and the citrus. But the shrimp was just ok. Overall, the dish was lovely but not a wow.

The short rib was perfectly done. Beautifully plated with horseradishy potato filled pierogi. And just not quite there. It's like when you and your lover get everything right, but something distracts you right at the most inopportune moment.

The pot de creme was excellent. I love the white chocolate curls, and the preserves. I think the texture is a little too custardy, but that's a minor quibble.

Moxie should get more stars. I look forward to coming back no matter what. But I think I'll face away from those infernal TVs that hang over the bar. And I won't order a Manhattan."}
{"text":"Had a reservation and was seated on time. Took 15 min.to get our drinks another 30 mins. For our salmon dip. 90 minutes total before our entre showed up. The restaurant was not especially busy. Manager was more interested in making excuses. Never bothers me to pay for a good dining experience. Should have went somewhere else"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and the food was quite good. Salmon was well cooked, their salad was fresh and tasty, and their sorbet was probably the best part of the meal and hit the spot. Can't hate on the good service either. 

Nice spot for a nice sit down lunch."}
{"text":"I'm wavering between a 3 and 3 1/2 stars.  I dined here with 2 friends. The food was tasty and well prepared, but nothing really stood out for me.  I started with the Caesar salad, which was just ok, kinda pale and dull in comparison to other Caesar salads that I've had.  I'm used to deep green romaine lettuce and a rich tangy dressing.   It was good but not memorable.   I ordered the short rib entree as my main course.  The short ribs were tender, (a bit fatty) and served with small squares of au gratin potatoes and a few brussel sprouts.  The plate was artfully presented with the alternating servings of short rib and potatoes displayed on the plate.  The short rib was served in a delightful forest mushroom reduction.   I would have loved more brussel sprouts on the plate.   Once again, the entree was good, but not memorable.  We shared the baked hot chocolate dessert, which was probably the highlight of the meal.  Rich, dense, warm and chocolately.  Service was pretty good, our server was a bit awkward and standoffish, but all in all this was a good meal.  I'm not sure that meal was worth this price point. I'd return, just wouldn't be my first choice of places to go."}
{"text":"Ate here on an early Friday night with my wife.  We had reservations but that did not matter since there were only about 10 tables that were filled.  However, even though our waitress had only 2 tables that she was taking care of, it seemed like she really did not have a clue about what she was doing - i.e. serve her customers.  After being seated, it took her about 10 minutes to realize that she had a 2nd table to take care of.  She got our drink orders and took another 10 minutes to bring them back.  Then she said that she would be right back to take our orders even though we were ready after 20 minutes to sitting and memorizing the menu.  After 30 minutes of being in the restaurant, she finally took our orders.  

The bread was really good.  The food arrived 50 minutes after we set foot in the restaurant, and by now, the place had pretty much filled up.  The food was pretty good.  We started with the tempura mushrooms.  Fantastic.  The Ceasar salad was also very flavorful.  The sardines did not overpower the sauce.  My wife got the roasted salmon, which was overcooked and really dry despite the sauce it was sitting in.  I was pretty happy with the lamb shank.  We did not have room for desert.

Overall, the food was good, but nothing to get excited over.  I'm pretty sure that the wait that we experienced had a lot to do with how the food tasted to us.  They would have gotten 4 stars if the waitress was experienced enough to serve her customers properly.  I've had much better service at Claim Jumper's/Chili's/Bahama Breeze/Olive Garden, which is pretty sad for a upscale establishment such as Moxie.  I would love to go back and try other items on their menu, and hopefully our wait staff will be competent in the future."}
{"text":"Sorry, but the next time I go for a $39 steak, I'll go to Fleming's. I went with a group of friends and my bill alone was $72, BEFORE tip. I was so annoyed because the food was mediocre. I wanted a salad really bad but was told they were side salads. So I got a steak and the \"side salad.\" The salad came out and I could have easily had it was a meal, especially if I added meat to it. I felt lied to. The steak was just ok and I can easily say I'd never go back. On top of that our waiter always seemed bothered the whole time. Pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time on a Thursday during happy hour. The staff were very friendly and service was quick. I got smoked salmon guacamole, which was interesting, but I would have liked to have more smoked salmon and perhaps smaller pieces to be evenly distributed throughout the guacamole. The happy hour menus offered very reasonably priced appetizers and cocktails (high alcohol in my margarita and my boyfriend's mojito). I will say they don't have a large selection of beer though- mostly wine and cocktails. My entree was the best part. I got duck breast, and the waiter recommended I get it cooked medium to adequately melt the fat, which was perfect. I don't order duck often, so the tip was appreciated. I would be back more often if I lived in the Beachwood area!"}
{"text":"When in Beachwood- Moxie it is! I Everything was impeccable from the service to the atmosphere and most important-- the food! We ordered muscles as an app ( they were alright, would try something else next time) and my fiancee ordered a burger and said it was one of the best he has ever had. I chose the gulf shrimp entree which I practically inhaled. It was extremely fresh, full of flavor and the \"forbidden rice\" they serve it on is unlike any rice variation I have ever tasted. I think I would have a hard time trying anything else upon returning, it was that good!"}
{"text":"Somewhat lazy service, noise place, but an OK menu. It could be great if they did away with the fried stuff... Still a nice place!"}
{"text":"I my birthday dinner here the food is amazing but that butter ooooommmmgggg the Ambiance is really great too and the prices are really fair for the quality that you get love this place"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with three colleagues.  Food quality is definitely five stars.  Service can be slow though, so that is why this is downgraded to four stars.  Also, cycled through requests for four different wines that were on their list, only to be told one by one that they were out of them.  To their credit, they gave us a complimentary round of drinks for the delay and trouble.  So, I would go again, but only if I have plenty of time to spend."}
{"text":"I had the lemon-crusted cod on risotto. There are things about restaurant fish that I look for, and this dish hit all the right marks. First off, the skin and crust was crispy and well-seared. The meat was flaky, well cooked, yet moist and tender. The infusion of citrus and the way it was seasoned did not overpower. It tasted as if it was caught that day and did not taste \"fishy\". The risotto provided a good balance.

My dinner date had the rib-eye, which I tasted. The things I look for: they had the done-ness right and it was tender. Red and Moxie are the only places that get the done-ness correct 100% of the time (The reason why I'm a regular at Red). These had bacon fingerling potatoes and spiced green beans on the side. The whole combination worked and made for an interesting mix of flavors.

I'm coming back."}
{"text":"My 2nd visit to Moxie was a scaled back night out with my hubby.  We sat at the bar, had a couple of drinks, a couple of appetizers, and just generally enjoyed a few hours out alone.  We chose Moxie based on a a dinner last summer there that was amazing.   

The bartender was helpful but not intrusive.  We opted to start with the chese plate - we selected 3 varieties, you can also get a larger sampler of 5.  The portions were a good size, and served with some toast points and a little chutney.  Next it was mussels and fries.  Both were pretty good, although the mussels were roasted, which made the shells brittle and the mussels a little challenging to eat.  

Overall, a great place to go for a reasonably priced, upscale night out."}
{"text":"This review is dedicated to Jerome.

Wow.  Here's the deal.  I'm an outta-towner that gets here now and again.  I brought my honey for a long weekend and we had a great night at the Velvet Tango Room and Jerome said to try Moxie's.  

I did.

Let the valet parking go.  Let the It's-in-an-office-park? response go.  Let it all go because the food is what it's about.  

I had the Grilled Lamb Rack over Polenta and the Sweet Bean Pesto.  It was fabulous!  

Too many people don't appreciate lamb and too many restaurants have caused that lack of appreciation by producing marginal to much less than marginal dishes.  If you want to introduce someone to it, take them to Moxies.

I can't remember the wine, but I let the bartender pair it for me and she did great.  Sitting at the bar was just fine for a week night and the place had a nice little buzz for a Tuesday evening.

Recommended, highly."}
{"text":"Legit glad I didn't let nostalgia get the best of me. I drove past Moxie looking for J. Alexander's, which I haven't eaten in 10 years. I gave up and spun back and wow. 

Had the salmon with Brussels sprouts hash. They say it comes with bacon, but it's really lardon or pork belly. FAR too thick for just bacon. Just amazing. Great service too."}
{"text":"I thought that over time, my expectations for Moxie were building up wayy too much, but Moxie definitely didn't disappoint!

Even though Moxie is a really nice restaurant, I had always been under the impression that it would be really stuffy and uncomfortable - which it wasn't at all! It hit some magical balance of being upscale but still really approachable. I came here on one of those weird fall evenings that still somehow felt like summer so we sat on the patio, which was really nice. The hostesses were really friendly and sweet, and so was our server.

The food was incredible. I ordered the scallop dish that was on the menu at the time, and my friend ordered some type of steak.. maybe a filet? Everything on both of our plates was perfect - the steak was probably the best steak I've ever tasted, and my scallops were so good that I cleaned my plate!

If you've been putting off a visit to Moxie - don't. Go now. It's great!"}
{"text":"I have been to Moxie several times over the years. While the food is generally good to exceptional, I noticed a deterioration of service over the past year. This culminated with me leaving the bar where I intended to dine a couple of months ago due to a lack of service. On a Tuesday evening, there were maybe 5 tables occupied and one other person at the bar. I sat at the bar for 5 minutes with no bartender in evidence. He then showed up only to tell me he would be right back. Five minutes later, I left. It seems like service may be bringing this place down, judging from other reviews. I hope this changes.  Until I see some more positive reviews, I will dine elsewhere."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good and presentation was fine...service started off great and quickly turned into not so much......filling water glasses, impossible... taking full glasses of wine...yeah why would I want to drink that when I had an empty glass of water to look at.  Food overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"We went to Moxie last night for New Year's Eve dinner.  We started our evening with a leisurely drink at the bar which was quite enjoyable.  Then, after a bit we moved to our table for our 7:45 pm dinner reservation.  We waited a ridiculous period of time for an initial contact and drink order.  The server apologized, said a number of tables were seated all at once and promised things would \"smooth out.\"  An hour and a half later the server asked us how our entries were.  Huh?  We were still waiting for our salads!  The food (once we got it) was exceptional.  If you like great food presented in interesting ways you MUST try Moxie!  However, come with ZERO expectations about well timed courses. 

 We don't mind paying good money for a nice evening out.  But when the bill for two approaches $150, please don't seat me at a table leaving me to look around and wonder whether a server has been assigned to our table.  And please don't let my water glass sit empty.

Bonus points for the bluesy live entertainment and balloons that created a festive New Years atmosphere."}
{"text":"As always, we can count on Moxie to make a special evening even better. My wife and I went in to celebrate her birthday. Our server Joy was supper accommodating and on point on everything. She suggested we had the blueberry dessert and it was fantastic. The chef created a delicious vegetarian plate for both of us and it was delivered by Dan, one the managers. Great overall experience. We will always choose Moxie as our celebration restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is a bit over rated I think. The food is a bit too salty and the staff isn't always up to par with fine dining. I would say it was a pit pricey for the experience and quality of food I had here with my boyfriend a few weeks ago. It was a one time visit place for me. I doubt I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"The thai beef salad is one of the best lunches I've had in a while! 

I know what you're thinking--\"It's a damn steak salad... how great could it be?!\" Well, not only was it tasty, but also unique with cold, broken rice noodles, lots of veggies and a phenom vinaigrette. It's almost like a thai chop salad, but with delicious, perfectly cooked and seasoned beef skewers laid on top. Really, really good people. I could taste a very small amount of mint used, which I'm typically not a fan of at.all. But, in this instance, it didn't bother me!

I also loved the vibe on the patio for lunch. It was laid back, while still being upscale and the service did not falter. I must say that inside the restaurant looked rather stale, but that's just from walking through to 1) be seated outside and 2) use the restroom. That's not to say that I'd never come back to eat inside Moxie, but outdoors is definitely my preference. Besides, this outdoor lunch experience was my very first time at Moxie.

If you follow my reviews you know how important ample parking is to me, and Moxie definitely has that. But, I will say it's sort of out of my way to get to this side of town--and honestly, it looked a little bit out of place amongst the corporate buildings and plazas I actually drove past the restaurant once and then found it once I turned around. I guess that's the struggle of a Near Westsider discovering east side gems."}
{"text":"Moxie is a great restaurant. I have eaten here twice, both times enjoyed great food and service. Love the atmosphere. The menu caters to all tastes and dishes are prepared very well. I will hopefully make it dine here again."}
{"text":"Probably the single, best restaurant in Cleveland's east-side suburbs. 

Relentlessly consistent in its playful menu choices, complex presentations, and rich, tasty food. 

You can't go wrong with any meat, fish, or poultry entree, they're all elegantly spiced, refreshingly moist, and perfectly cooked. 

There are a lot of fun desserts to choose from, including the \"Campfire Creme Brulee,\" which features graham crackers, marshmallows, and chocolate, but I have to recommend the baked hot chocolate soufflé --- it's amazing. 

Equally fitting for a business meeting, a date, or a nice family dinner.

Truly the best Cleveland's suburbs have to offer."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday just because I was in the area.  The interior has a great vibe and there are many great selections on the menu.  My boyfriend and I shared the calamari, which was pretty good.  I also had their chocolate desert, free for my birthday, which was a surprise.  It was really good!

I would go there again because I have had a meal or two here in the past and remember them being really great in presentation & taste.

Our service was outstanding."}
{"text":"First time visit. Heard  and read many positive reviews.  Ambiance was nice. Bartender, Michael, was friendly and attentive. After we sat, we were greeted with an attentive waitress. So far, so good. But then the meal arrived. Meh. Risotto had nice texture but flavor was missing. My dinner partner tried the house made mushroom Bolognese pasta. We are both quite familiar with fresh pasta, this was either under cooked or not fresh as it was hard, almost crunchy. Certainly not al dente. 

I don't know that we will be back."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I've ever been too! Great service with exceptional food!! I recommend the shrimp and steak! Also the hot chocolate desert! Yum yum yum yummy."}
{"text":"Have not been to Moxies in a while.  It was a last minute reservation on a Saturday afternoon.  Service was slow to get our drink order so we decided to order appetizers right away  We ordered the fried dumpling and 5 cheese plate  both where very good, we only ate half the cheese plate to much before entree.  Service was slow, but today service is that way across the board.  It actually was irritating I needed to ask for a water refill.  I ordered the duck.  It was done perfect medium rare and amazing flavor.  I will say it was one of the best duck dishes I have ever had.  My date had a filet that was done to her perfect taste.  The left over cheese was the desert.  What bummed me out at 5he end is i had to wait for the valet who was working both restaurants.  If service was better I would have given it a five star."}
{"text":"I've driven past this restaurant multiple times, and finally made reservations to attend.  What a pleasant surprise.  I tried very hard to find something wrong with the experience, but failed.  The menu is diverse and interesting.  Oysters are great, and the roasted pear appetizer was unique and interesting.  Salads were awesome.  The duck confit was excellent - crispy on the outside, tender on the inside and very flavorful.  The roasted beef cheeks were hearty but relatively light.  Excellent dessert menu as well if you have room.  Nice wine list and attentive service.  Will definitely come back.  One of the best northeast Ohio dining experiences I have had."}
{"text":"4.5 stars for party room events!

I attended a wine tasting here.  It was about 75 people from one of my meet-up groups. Now anytime I go to one of the 25$ plus tax and tip, my expectations are low.  I'm just here to mingle and if the food is good then that is an extra bonus!

The food was amazing, especially for this type of event.  Top notch.  I will say -.5 stars as it was a bit hard to get some water. That is my only negative.

Positives+

The food did not stop. It kept coming and coming : )   The calamari was very good,  It was served with a spicy mayo type of sauce, crispy and tender.  Steak lollipops served medium rare. Usually those are shoe leather at most places.  I could not tell what kind of beef but it was tender, so I'm guessing tenderloin.  Chicken lollipops very flavorful.  They were  that good that I am not calling them meat on a stick!

There was also cured meat and cheese platters that were wonderful.  There were roasted veggies that were flavorful, I suppose it was for the ahem vegan crowd.  There were also some fancy cheese dips,  salads and other stuff.  I can say this was an Atkins friendly wine tasting event.

The crowd was great.  I found out that I made a lot of friends at the costume party from the History Museum.  I was talking to a couple of women and I kept saying that I knew them.  But little did we realize when I met them I was in full hooker clothing with a wig!  Once we connected the dots the real fun began!

So all in all Moxie really seamed to have picked up its game. I would have no problem recommending hosting a party like this for just the low price of 31.99. But wait if you call right now there is more!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this a 3 star rating because of the service. The food was excellent but our waiter was not. Our waiter would walk away from the table before getting everyones drink order. This happened at least twice. He messed up the order of dishes brought to the table. Forgot our 
bread. I could go on.
The food was very good. Definitely give it a try and hope you don't get the same waiter as we did."}
{"text":"So I ended up going to Moxie for their restaurant week offering a few weeks ago, and it was quite a pleasant experience.  The appetizer was a warm tomato tart, which was a tart of puff pastry topped with ricotta, tomatoes, basil, and a vinaigrette.  Overall a great combination of tastes, although just slightly too soft/soggy on the bottom.  For my main course, I chose the pan seared trout, which came with gnocchi, swiss chard, and green beans.  I was surprised to find such a generous offering of trout, which was moist, with a delicious skin, and the meat was cooked to just the right amount of tenderness.  My only complaint about the dish was that the gnocchi were sparse, and were almost playing a game of hide and seek under the trout.  The dessert was \"baked hot chocolate\", a gooey chocolate cake topped with a nice helping of whipped cream.  It was a great ending to a fantastic meal.  

The restaurant itself was a pleasure to be at, with a classy interior design, and I had no complaints about the waitstaff.  All in all, I had a great meal and was glad to have stopped by for restaurant week."}
{"text":"Awful service! It wasn't the servers' fault, but it took forever for our meals to be served.  This place has a small kitchen and apparently it was \"slammed\" by capacity.
The manager apologized and \"comped\" us with desserts, but all we really wanted was good food and service.  This is the 3rd time in a row that the service has sucked-not a ringing endorsement for a purported upscale restaurant.

Fair service and average food.  How the \"mighty\" have fallen.  Until a few years ago the food and service were excellent-not any more!  Maybe management is devoting its attention to the \"Red\" restaurants and neglecting this one.  I will probably never go back, which will be no great loss as far I am concerned."}
{"text":"Moxie, The Restaurant is located near the intersection of Richmond and Chagrin Blvd in Beachwood. Very clean and the staff is very professional. I took my friend here to eat one evening and I was given the same great service that a normal, first timer would get. Always get the Moxie burger. Its delicious. You definitely want to impress someone, bring them here. This place is not cheap but there is a reason why"}
{"text":"When I lived in Cleveland a decade ago Moxie was my \"treat spot,\" and I loved it.  11 years later and living here in Cleveland I have returned and remember why this was my treat spot when I was young and poor.  I have been three times and have had a great time both times.  I have sat at the bar both times and all three bartenders that I have had have been very engaging and friendly.  I have had the beet & blue salad, lamb ragout, calamari and gulf shrimp and they were all excellent.  I would order all 4 again and would suggest them to others.  My one criticism would be the hot chocolate dessert.  I have had it twice, and while both times the taste was great, the consistency had been completely different.  One time it was very gooy and molten and the other time it was more the consultancy of a moist chocolate cake.  Both were good, but it was inconstant.  I have had great experiences and will be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and exquisite food! I had the ribeye and it was cooked to perfection.  Could've cut it with my butter knife. Will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Moxie gets 5 tonight.  Another business dinner, this one better than the one before.  Our server dropped a bottle of Pellegrino that hit the side of the table on its way to the floor.  He tried to catch it with his foot to avoid shattered glass, and sent it spinning instead, spraying several of our feet.  But, his quick-witted and self-deprecating reaction was perfect (shit happens), and our service was truly the best I've had in years, anywhere.

Added a small plate to the list of those I've tried and enjoyed here, the mushrooms, which are a tempura preparation, and had the braised veal shoulder which was out. of. sight.  I mean it was perfect.  A nice crust on the outside, and just melty slow-cooked goodness inside.  Outrageous flavor.  The brussels sprouts were even better than Lolita's because they tasted like brussels sprouts.  Didn't think this was possible.

The bread and butter continues to be better than bread and butter should be.

This is not the finest dining in Cleveland.  But for a $23 entree, the food and service quality far exceed expectations.  

Oh also, the guy who was entertaining us had so much faith in our server that he said, \"we want a bottle of red wine.  You know what we like to eat, so bring us something good to drink.\"  Didn't give him a budget or any guidance.  If I was the server, this would've scared the hell out of me.  He brought out a bottle of Orin Swift's 2008 The Prisoner.  My boss's favorite, and one of my favorites, too.  We were all happy."}
{"text":"Have you ever been to a steakhouse where the head chef comes out, draws a picture of the cow on the menu & explains to you the piece of meat that you're going to be eating?  It was Steak 101 & a valuable lesson for my future steakhouse visits.
Both the appetizers & the steaks were great, my only complaint is that there were only 2 people on staff & we had to frequently wait for our drinks to be filled & our plates to be cleared.  I've never been to Red nextdoor, but I hear that it's 1 step up from Moxie.  This place is a nice steakhouse, a step up from outback & a step down from Ruth's Chris.  If you're in the area & looking for a nice steak, check it out."}
{"text":"We dined at Moxie for the first time this past Friday. 

The first thing I noticed was the Valet Parking. Even though this is a finer dining establishment, I still found it a bit odd they offered Valet, seeing Moxie has their very own private lot with all spaces within a limited distance to the front door. But like I said, this is a finer dining establishment, so I suppose I can't fault the place in offering the option to those who want to pay. Just made it seem a little pretentious when I saw two Ferrari's parked via valet within 10 feet from the restaurant's entrance. Are people that lazy, or are they just that hard up for attention?

Since the weather was nice, we chose to sit on the Patio. The outdoor area was pretty well decorated with mood lighting, artwork and well placed landscaping to hide the adjacent parking lot.  There was even a live 3 piece band who played soft melodies throughout the night.

We got seated pretty close to the outdoor bar, so it was pretty loud, which made conversation rather difficult. But I guess you'll have that in an outdoor space. I was disappointed that neither the hostess who seated us, nor the waiter offered any nightly specials. We were both shoved multiple menu's and after a few, were asked if we made a decision. I expected a more proper introduction. I also asked for a recomendation and the waiter answered by saying something was \"really good\", \"his favorite\", etc. Our waiter was nice, don't get me wrong, but I would've expected more knowledge from a server at an establishment such as Moxie. 

Upon ordering drinks, I found the beer menu lacking. The most exciting beer they offered was Smithwicks. The wine menu was very extensive though. Moxie even has a Sommelier that walks around giving professional advice for pairings or just to chat amongst the winos. 

Onto the food. I ordered the stuffed peppers with heirloom tomatoes on garlic bread for an appetizer. The dish was excellent. There were 3 peppers total and each of them a notch hotter in temperature, which I imagine was by design. The heirloom tomatoes were also a nice touch. Very fresh and flavorful.

For the main course, I had to order the burger. Why you might ask did I order a Burger among all the other offerings? Because it was an $18.50 burger! I had to see what an eighteen dollar burger tasted like! 

The burger was intimidating. The massive hunk of meat was served in between a kaiser bun and piled with lettuce, tomato, cheddar, bacon and sauted red onion. A side of fries and fried onion strings with ketchup accompanied the burger. The burger was cooked perfectly to my request. Overall, it was satisfying, but lacked the knockout punch I expected from an $18.50 burger. I imagine it's possible that I built my hopes up too high, expecting perfection, but I can say that I've had better for $5 (happy hour at Lolita). This burger from Moxie was pretty basic. Aside from being mammoth in size, there was nothing about it that set it apart from the rest. Personally, I thought it was boring. No special sauce, only mayo smeared on the bun, with a side of store bought ketchup (tasted like Heinz). A grilled kaiser bun is typical for your run of the mill burger, but for this, I would've expected a more substantial hunk of crusty goodness to hold such a hunk of meat. The bun they served it on wasn't nearly adequate. The bottom started to fall apart halfway though my meal. The bacon was fatty and undercooked.  I also noticed that the onion that was served with it was just the outer peal, not a full slice, which made for a weird texture. 

My dining companion wasn't as critical as I was and enjoyed her meal very much. She ordered the salmon. 

For dessert, we shared the Baked Hot Chocolate. The whipped Creme and Cocoa was a perfect reminder of winter's favorite tasty beverage, only more substantial and in dessert form.

Overall, Moxie has the potential to be something really special, but since I found it lacking in several areas I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. A little less attention on image and a little more focus on quality and this place would be phenomenal."}
{"text":"What's a good lunch without a piece of duck? As a matter of fact, I've been here for both lunch and dinner. It's a good spot. The duck was very tasty, but portion was tiny. For what it is, the price just does not quite seem worth it. Our waiter seemed a bit scattered.

The burger for dinner was very much on the mediocre side, French fries were less than mediocre."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Stop by every time I'm in town from CA. Love their fish tacos for lunch.  Nice atmosphere and little expensive but worth it."}
{"text":"I went back today to experience good food and excellent service-a welcome change from my past few visits."}
{"text":"Went for a Private luncheon party.  Salmon was very good.  Chicken dish was dried out. Loved the appetizers.  Chocolate hot chocolate dessert was awesome."}
{"text":"wonderful restaurant.....great, trendy decor, good vibe, nice patio. food is excellent, the wedge salad was SO big it was hanging off of the plate!! steaks cooked as ordered, roasted olive appetizer a wonderful surprise!
service is friendly, attentive (sometimes too on top of us)& quick to please. i found that the waiter and food runners a bit unpolished with their technique of \"auctioning\" off food at the table. i really hate when servers start yelling out...\"who gets the...\", it's rather tacky and annoying that we are expected to raise our hands like school children.  i expect that at a denny's not at a moxie.
otherwise, a nice find.
one other note.....valet parking in a strip mall, really? just stupid!!! like i need somebody to park my car in a space just 10 feet from the door......"}
{"text":"was at the RED couple years ago 1st time in town and really loved it... so i told myself this time... i have to try The Moxie!!!

i believe they have the same owner... you could tell by their joint restroom... - which was totally a mess this time i went... toilet paper everywhere... some drunk lady inside keep complaining outloud to her gf outside about the boys.. but oh well, i wasn't there for the restroom so i just went in, done my business, and came right out...

loved our waitress and i can't believe i didn't ask her name!! she saw us exchanging gifts so she whispered to me to see if it was a special gathering... i said there is a bday girl, and a graduate... she just said... 'i got it' with a understanding smile on her face...

loved their bread and the special seasoned olive oil... had cocktail shrimp as appetizer which was, hm, just so-so.... not really stands out... entrees were excellent on the other hand... the lamb, fish, steak... and scallop! (her recommendation too!) we all loved it! 

when we asked for the desert menu, she whispered to me again and said 'you have stuff coming, you wanna see the portion first before you order more?' i said sure... and they came.............. there were two complimentry deserts, one has 'happy birthday' written, the other said 'congratulation!'.... they were HUGE... and i believe it's the warm chocolate cake from their menu... oh YUMMY!!!!! sure enough, that filled us up... we didn't have to order more...

it was a special night for us and they just made it even more wonderful! loved loved it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely TERRIBLE. 
Second time there. First time was mediocre. We wanted to give it another shot with a few friends, but got some of the worst service possible. 
Sat down at 7:45. Our waiter took 20 minutes to ask for drink orders. Than disappeared for another 20 minutes after we got our drinks (which by the way, he got wrong). At 8:50 we had to ask him for the bread. A table that was seated at the same time was already well into their meal. Despite trying to be very quick with ordering food, it didn't arrive until 9:30. 
I ordered the Burger. I was told it's quite good and wanted to try it. Asked for Med-Rare... it came out mid-well. Next one came in complete raw. Had to send it out again. This time it came with a manager who very nicely said they will take it off the bill. I thought that was very nice until we got the bill. It had a built-in 20% gratuity (for a table of 6 people). They apparently couldn't take it off. The manager told me he was \"not allowed\" to take it off. He could have cared less about the service we got. Regardless of the issue with the burger, I cannot believe this type of service seems reasonable. Absolutely shameless."}
{"text":"My husband and I made reservations for Moxie re first night we got back from our honeymoon and we had a fantastic time. The place is spacious, sophisticated, and dimly lit but the decor was more trendy and casual. Drinks are standard and well made and presentation was great. We shared a variety of appetizers which were all delicious as were the sides. We got steak and the kimchi pork belly bowl and they were incredible. If you like spicy food this dish will make your night! Our server surpised us with a baked hot chocolate cake (which I had seen earlier in the night and wanted to try) and it was really just perfect."}
{"text":"Almost an hour wait for the food to come out on a weekend eve where the restaurant was not busy. One of the members in our party did not get his meal with the rest of the group (going on an hour now). Seems like a disorganized place. The server did not come by much. Medium well burger was cooked beyond well done. Epic fail, not sure how they stay in business."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this restaurant several times over the past couple of years and every time I love it more. I just wish I lived closer. The staff is always great, the chef continues to deliver food that makes your mouth water just remembering it. 

Please open a location in Minneapolis!"}
{"text":"Was here for Cleveland restaurant week. 3 course meal was great. Highly recommend the pork belly. Service was a little slow for a not too crowded Wednesday night, but the food was really good and very filling! Would go again for a date night. P.S. Wine list is on the expensive side!"}
{"text":"Another poor experience at Moxie.  I have been going there since they opened and have had their B&E chicken maybe 40 times.  Tonight's was bad.
It was a hummingbird size portion and cooked within an inch of its poor life, dry as a bone.  It used to be the go to entree, alas no more.  KFC next time I want chicken for dinner."}
{"text":"Came here for a date night.  Food was good but there are so many places within 10 minutes with more interesting menus at a cheaper price.  It wasn't bad by any stretch of the imagination,  just nothing unique enough to want to come back."}
{"text":"Went for lunch earlier this week. Ordered the Tomato Bisque soup and it was not very good. Was going to just exchange for another one but the waitress never came back around until it was time to offer us dessert. I then got a Caesar salad with chicken for my meal and it was not bad. My mom and sister both had the Tuna tartar and neither really enjoyed. Said it tasted like cilantro and did not like the presentation. My mom also got the cauliflower soup and that was delicious. Overall, the food was okay enough to go back for lunch. Would probably not try dinner."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and it took a solid 20 minutes before the bartender came over. It wasn't busy, she was just nowhere to be found. Drink was normal. Grabbed a pot stickers app which was okay. But for 1 glass of wine, 1 g&t, and pot stickers, our bill was $40. Too expensive for not great service. I recommend checking some other places out before choosing this one."}
{"text":"Ok, I normally don't do this, but I remember taking client to Moxie because of the great wine selection.  Moxie has always been great to me, and this time is was simply good.  It is definitely 4 stars, but I had a few questions concerning my entree and I was confronted by a very rude individual.  I guess it is rare, but Shelly made my experience less than desirable.  My Saturday night was great right up until her.  I guess after years of coming here the staff and the level of service is not proportional their food and associated price.  I have given up on Moxie and may start just to go to RED as they share a patio.  I hate to travel downtown to find a replacement, but may be forced to."}
{"text":"Great place and ambiance . Met the lady friends here for cocktails. Service was great . Will be back in a few weeks ."}
{"text":"Monday reservation at 7:30pm. No waiting. The place looks casual for a \"dressy\" restaurant. Mostly dressy crowd, but some people wore T-shirts. Black pipes in the ceilings going for the rustic look. Couple TV's on one side of the hall. Good service by the waiters.

The menu has \"small,\" \"medium,\" \"large\" sections. My review only consists of the medium menu.

Tuna tartare: Not mind-blowing. Not what you expect from a high-end restaurant. Steer clear unless you are a tartare connoisseur.

Calamari: Not mind-blowing. Quiet tasty, but really, it's just calamari.

Duck pizza & cheese pizza (called something else) for the Monday pizza special: duck pizza was pretty good, but not mind-blowing. Cheese pizza was worse than Papa John's (which is tasty).

Overall: these \"medium\" sections - at around $14 price line - may seem like a good level to downgrade from the more expensive \"large\" sections ($20-27). Don't. These do not scream \"$x3, special stuff.\" I wouldn't really get them for appetizers either to be honest."}
{"text":"Moxie is home to the best burger in Cleveland, hands down.

I know there are many other good options here, but I cannot stray from the burger and don't plan on it. The beef is incredible, and it is topped with a delicious aioli sauce along with veggies, cheese and bacon if you want it. This burger is so tasty that, next time, I don't think I'll even get it with sauce; the meat tastes good enough by itself that even a delicious aioli detracts from it in my opinion.

The fries are also incredible, but they're merely a sideshow to my cheeseburger main event.

And to top a meal off at Moxie, one must partake in the baked hot chocolate. I don't really know what baked hot chocolate is, but it seems like a really moist chocolate cake served in a mug and topped with tons of whipped cream. Whatever it is, it's a top 5 dessert in Cleveland and a must-order any time you stop by Moxie.

It might seem strange to order pub-esque food at a nice restaurant like Moxie, but please do try the burger next time. You don't know what you're missing."}
{"text":"Took a business client here last night. Place was busy and was a bit loud due to that but was not loud to the point you could not have a conversation. The food was great! Two people had the CAB filet, one had the halibut dinner and I had the duck breast. All were great! Service was good after rush died down. Customer loved the evening. Recommend Moxie to anyone for business or personal dining."}
{"text":"Moxie, I am quite impressed!  This may be one of the best meals I have had in recent memory.  While I could do without the car dealership sponsored valet parking - the brand new, deaerl Maseratis, Mercedes sports cars, etc - could be quite off-putting - I will forgive them for that because the food is so good. 

We sat in the lounge part of the restaurant and I really enjoy that atmosphere - a little more casual than the main part of the restaurant.  The menu has tons of delicious looking options and I actually had trouble deciding.  I eventually decided on the soup special and the spicy shrimp scampi with couscous - which doesn't really sound that exciting, I realize - but the flavors and spices in this dish took it to a different level.  I have had so many boring shrimp dishes that, looking back, I am embarrassed I ever thought they were good.  The soup of the day with a bacon corn chowder that was a very hearty serving (not one of those measly tiny cups) and was perfect for a cold, Cleveland winter day. 

I would pass on the cocktails, however.  They seemed to be using cheap mixers and cheap liquor - making for, to be nice, not tasty drinks.  The wine list seemed nice, though, so I would recommend sticking with that if you want alcohol to accompany your meal."}
{"text":"i liked that I can see inside the kitchen. 

We had the potato gnocchi, crab cake.. I had the tuna tartare and he had the roasted duck. The baked hot chocolate for dessert. Everything was good, but nothing stood out. Tuna tartare had dill in it--I don't like dill. He says the duck was good, but nothing he'd come back for. The dessert was probably the best item."}
{"text":"We went here for Easter brunch. Let me just say that the food was very good. If it was just the food I was grading, it would have gotten 4 stars. Unfortunately, the service was mediocre, to sub-par.  We had to ask for refills for our pop, one time to someone whom wasn't our waiter. Our waiter basically ignored us for most of the meal. They forced a 20% gratuity on our bill, even though there were only 2 of us. I have never heard of automatically adding 20% gratuity for a table if 2. That's usually only for larger parties. But the worst part is that they charged us TAX on the gratuity, instead of just the meal!  I will say they re-rang the order for me and only charged me the tax on the meal, but that's only because I let them know it was completely unacceptable. At $102 for 2 people, I also think the place is way over-priced. While the food was good, the selection was extremely limited. A much better brunch, with many more options can be had at Blue Canyon, even if it isn't Easter and the service is far better.  I'm a little sick about the amount of money we spent on food (we just drank pop, no alcohol), versus the variety of selections and quality of service."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough great things about this place, its staff, and its management.  Went last night with a girlfriend to catch up and grab a bite - hostess was lovely and had no problem with my sitting at the bar to grab a drink since I was about 20 minutes early.  Bartender, Joshua, was very knowledgeable about wines and informed me about the 1/2 wine night (like I didn't already know!) and was great about food recommendations.  

The food was amazing - their Monday night pizzas are fantastic, as was the tuna and special ordered clams casino.  But the tipping point is their manager, Peter, who makes any person feel as if the are the most VIP in the house.  

I still have a fantastic feeling about my dinner (and some leftovers to boot!) - what more could you ask for from a restaurant?"}
{"text":"Have you ever had a dry short rib? It takes a lot of skill to suck all the moisture out of a short rib but Moxie somehow managed to do it... Terribly seasoned and paired with a terrible waitress just pissed me off on my birthday.  My bf's chicken dish was also overly sweet and cold. I'm so disappointed and pissed that someone had to pay for that dinner. There are too many great restaurants in Cleveland to waste money here. 

To celebrate my birthday, I asked my man to to take the trek from downtown all the way to Beachwood... What a mistake. It had been a while since I've been to Moxie and it has changed so drastically. The tables need a candle or some better lighting. If there's a party going on in the back, forget about the kitchen getting your food out in any timely manner. It took over 10 minutes for anyone to come over and give us water, let's not even talk about how long it took for our apps and dinner to get out. Never again!"}
{"text":"Moxie had improved its game during a recent mid-week visit.  It's still a sea of white collar business lunches from 12-1pm, but after that time, the atmosphere chilled out exponentially.  A pre-meal complimentary white bean spread with frizzled onions was fantastic.  The generously-portioned cod special with sun dried tomatoes and farro had brightness and umami goodness.  Prices may be on the upper \"treat\" end of the scale for some, but the portion sizes were large enough for leftovers to go home.  The dish of ice cream at the end was easily sizeable enough for multiple people to share!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was very clean, and stylish. The food was mediocre, I had the ribeye steak which I wasn't a fan of. It was pretty pricy but the service was decent."}
{"text":"Came here with a client and we both really enjoyed it.  For starters, it was very close to all the Beachwood hotels.  Everything was not the absolute best we've ever had but delicious and worth the value at the price point.  Scotch and bourbon selections were great.  The cheese board and entrees were fantastic.  I will be back."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. The food is great- but expensive. I was a little upset with the $9 appetizer Caesar salad- it was tiny and not worth the money. The Tuna tartar appetizer however, was amazing! Deff get it! Had the lamb chops special and that was very good! Great atmosphere and great vibes! Would come again."}
