{"text":"Il ne faut pas se fier à sa première impression lorsqu'on voit l'emplacement de ce restaurant. Une fois à l'intérieur, il y a une belle ambiance. Parfaite pour les 5 à 7 du jeudi. Les assiettes sont généreuses. Que dire des frites? Elle sont délicieuses: à la fois croustillantes et tendres. Lorsqu'il faut faire un choix entre les frites ou la salade, je propose le 50/50. La salade est composée d'une belle variété de légumes et les vinaigrettes sont savoureuses. Un bon rapport qualité/prix."}
{"text":"Beaucoup de restaurants font des frites, peu se donne la peine de les réussir. Ce n'est pas leur cas. Mayonnaise maison en plus!!!  J'ai pris un bagel au saumon fumé. Difficile de donner une évaluation pertinente. Le personnel prend à coeur le service et le client."}
{"text":"This is a cozy small place but somewhat spacious enough to accommodate a group of 6 people.   Very good warm baguette is served complimentary (refilled as well after they are ready from oven!).  Portions are good (=big), even the side orders!  Calamari and baked goat cheese toast were very good.  Pasta with clams, escargot (not typical as you can choose the sauce) were good as well.  Sangria was really good but not much alcoholic as we weren't buzzed at all after sharing the pitcher (=3-4 half glasses for each person).  Get the chocolate cake (wait for 15 min) as this was the best chocolate cake I've had and I don't like chocolate cake.  Overall, very good restaurant, attentive service and good ambiance.   PS: like many restaurants in this area, this is at a strip mall."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, well decorated. Seemed a bit on the loud side when fully packed but still able to carry on a conversation. they started things off right with fresh warm bread and butter. service was a bit slow but again it was packed.   We ordered the peanut dumplings as a starter. It was a good mixture of sweet and spicy with a nice peanuty taste.   after that we order the tortellini with prosciutto and mushrooms. The tortellini seemed pasty and store bought. the prosciutto made the cream sauce a bit to salty and seem to lack that rich creamy taste . as for the mushrooms just seemed lost in the dish. over all still a good dish it just missed the mark.   Dish two was a Vegetarian stir fry with added shrimp. Well cooked a bit of lemon grass would have been a nice touch as the ginger that was a mention ingredient seemed absent. and had a bit too much soy for my taste. still over all a good dish."}
{"text":"The couple who run this amazing restaurant are two of the nicest people on the planet. The food is constantly changing depending on the season. The ambiance outside (a tiny strip mall) belies the warm and chic atmosphere within. Reservations are a must as this tiny perfect little piece of heaven is busy!"}
{"text":"Oh did I ever enjoy myself!   As soon as I walked in I felt like I was at the Old Port which surprised me for the location (in a strip mall far from downtown)  Got a seat at the bar and was impressed that although the place is not huge and was completely packed- it was not cramped in the least.  I did see a few people try to get in before us but had no reso so they couldn't. It was full and I've heard it's like this every night- so make a reservation!   They have a nice range of entrees (we had spicy peanut dumplings) although it was a tough choice between that and the beef carpaccio! And I felt the rest of the menu-  including the table d'hôte, offered something for everyone.   I had the Waldorf salad (my 1st) which was refreshing and the filet mignon that almost melted in my mouth! Top that with a nice selection at the bar (although I always order a Crown- and they had it) I was really happy with my meal.   Ambiance wise- great music- everyone was having a great time, not too loud. A few people even started dancing at one point and it didn't bother anyone including staff.   I had a great time, really enjoyed my meal and put it on my 'go often' list :)"}
{"text":"If you are travelling from the Montreal airport to Ottawa, this is a great place to stop to have a nice meal. This place is more French than Italian, but the food is great. Escargots come in three different varieties. We had them with mushrooms, and it was delicious. Liver mousse was quite good, although it was served refrigerator-cold, and I am petty sure it would be better if it was served at almost room temperature. Cheesecake was really flavorful without being too sugary. Coffee was very good too. The menu is pretty extensive, and if everything else there is as good as what we had, then this place is a very easy choice."}
{"text":"Le Balnéo est un petit resto coincé dans une façade de centre commercial de l'île Perrot. Vu de l'extérieur, l'endroit semble banal. Mais une fois passée la porte, on est charmé par le décor intimiste et chaleureux aux murs vermeils. On offre ici une cuisine internationale qui se spécialise surtout dans les pâtes (une quinzaine de variétés en tout) et les grillades. Pour ma part, j'ai été littéralement séduit par leur Tortellini aux prosciutto et champignons avec oignons, vin blanc et sauce à la crème. Oui, le plat était riche et copieux, mais dans l'ensemble, très réussi. Je me suis régalé. Ma conjointe y est allée pour les linguines primaverra pour en arriver à la même conclusion que la mienne : le chef est très talentueux et les assiettes sont surprenantes, tant sur la présentation que sur la préparation.   Point négatif? Seulement deux : Les tables sont très rapprochées l'une de l'autre et la serveuse connaissait plus ou moins bien la carte des vins. Elle n'a pas été en mesure de me suggérer le vin qui allait le mieux avec mon plat. Un peu gênée par ma question, elle s'est contentée de me répondre : \" moi j'aime bien ce vin-là \". Sinon, rien à redire. Le service était rapide et courtois.     En bref : Menu varié, mais pas trop étendu. Large sélection de bière. Cartes des vins acceptables. Bon choix de fromages du Québec.   Je vous recommande tout spécialement l'endroit si vous désirez un bon plat de pâtes. Un petit conseil cependant. Comme le resto n'est pas grand, je vous suggère de réserver avant."}
{"text":"We decided to give this restaurant a second chance after a terrible first experience ..... and were happy we did. The owner came out to say hi to us and thanking us for coming back despite the past visit (thanks again for everything Derek).   It was the same waitress but this time she was very sweet, served us quickly, and paid attention to us whenever we needed anything.  I'll also assume the service is better when the restaurant isn't as full though because she seemed a lot less distracted compared to last time. The food was delicious, definately the tuna tataki to be recommended as well as their pastas.  Warm ambiance with a mixed older crowd.. I have to say it was a completely different experience as the first, would definately recommend:)"}
