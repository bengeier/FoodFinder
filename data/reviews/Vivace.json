{"text":"Went for a friend's birthday dinner on a Thursday night. There were others in the restaurant, but it wasn't packed. The food was okay, but our group wasn't wowed. We were seated upstairs and had some delayed service as our server seemed to also be working the bar. I'll give it another shot to try other dishes. I really liked the decor, just expected more from the rest of the experience."}
{"text":"Great place for a casual / upscale dinner.  It can get a little pricey if you have a couple drinks but the food is well worth it.  My favorite item is the duck, I've had it multiple times and it has been cooked perfectly each time."}
{"text":"I've visited Vivace several times. While I was dining in the restaurant area for brunch, everything was great. Mimosas kept flowing. Although the two times I've been to the bar, it's been a horrible experience. I went one evening for drinks. When I got there, the two bartenders were fighting, and I kept having to wave one of them down to order a drink (I was one of three guests at the bar). The second time I dined at the bar, it was for brunch, because there was a wait for the dining room. My friends and I grabbed a table by the bar, and it was a good 10-15 minutes before anyone greeted us. Again, the bar wasn't full by any means. We kept having to go to the physical bar to reorder drinks because no one was stopping by the table. On one occasion, the bartender told us to order from our server (who was m.i.a.), and when we said our server hadn't been around for a while, he rolled his eyes at us. The worst part was it took 2 hours for two courses to come out. No apologies, no managers. But two hours! By the time the second course came out, I had to box it and leave because I had somewhere else to be. The worst dining experience I've ever had. The dining area seems great, but avoid the bar at all costs."}
{"text":"I think this is one of my favorite places to be on a warm summer night.  I love to sit outside and gaze at all the twinklies....it is the most beautiful view of the city.  My man and I like to sit upstairs in the lounge area.  The bartenders are great.  The service is spot on.  Their food is really good too.  We always get the cheese tray, it has the best selection of cheeses and sweet touches like honey and fig marmalade.  I am a huge tapas fan so we typically get a bunch of appetizers and split them.  They have a nice wine selection and it is reasonably priced.  This place is really sexy.  Check it out."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to take my hubby on dates. The ambiance is super cool and the food is absolutely delicious. I love the meat and cheese board as an appetizer and pretty much all of their pasta dishes are fabulous. It's a good special occasion place too. Their patios also offer beautiful views of Charlotte."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. I am eternally grateful to them for accommodating a surprise I was putting together. I called in for a reservation and after having a lot of trouble at other places they gladly took mine. Not only that but I went in early to drop of a birthday cake and they took care of it, and brought it out at just the right time for us! They made it a good night!  The atmosphere is good too. It's a chic/urban place to have a large (or small) gathering. Very festive looking with the giant orange light fixtures, a large glass case of wine across an entire wall, and a staircase through the center.   The food is also fairly good. I had the Orecciette and I would recommend it to anyone. My friend also got one of their pizzas and that seemed pretty good too.   The only reason I do not give it a full 5 stars is: I didn't like the kitchen being viewable. Just a personal aesthetic choice. Another reason is that my boyfriend thought his dish was okay. Nothing to rave about. And the last reason is one of our waiters (we had two) was a grumpy-gus. While our other waiter was friendly, this one was slightly intimidating. I was reluctant to ask him for anything because he would give me a grumble and stalk away when I asked. He seemed really unhappy to be there.   Overall though. A good place to go. I definitely say try it!!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent.   Unusual credit card activity on a rarely used credit card after dining here."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited Vivace for the fist time last night, looking for a nice place to eat outside and enjoy a view of Charlotte.  We were seated outside and the view was wonderful....the pleasant surprise was just how good the food was....Everything tasted great and presented well....my only regret was not ordering the meat and cheese platter that looked spectacular and tasted just as good (according to the diners at the table next to us).  Vivace features Great view and great food in a lively atmosphere."}
{"text":"I am visiting a friend, who is new to the city, and we found this place on yelp. We looked at the yelp reviews and saw that there was a pizza with goat cheese. We were sold. Once we got there we were sad to find out they did not have the goat cheese pizza, but did have a pasta with goat cheese sauce instead. It was just okay, we enjoyed the mushroom risotto more. We also liked the mango Bellinis!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing and so is the ambiance - elegant, high energy and fun. Their menu is what a real Italian food is about - sophistication and a flavor explosion.   Unfortunately, it's a bit pricey for me. If I could afford it, I'd be there at least once a month."}
{"text":"So my boyfriend and I went here for our one year anniversary. IT WAS AMAZING! We got there about 30 minutes before our scheduled reservation time, and they let us right in. We sat in the upstairs which was so cozy and romantic. The candlelit tables added a special touch. Our server was prompt and attentive. He also helped us decipher the menu which was in all Italian. We had no idea what most of the words meant but he walked us through it. We ordered a bunch of drinks, two different appetizers, two different entrees, and two desserts. LOL We wanted to splurge for our anniversary, and we did just that. It was worth every single penny we spent. It was so delicious and plenty to eat. Needless to say, we were stuffed when we left. I would definitely recommend to anyone to go here, especially for a date. We will certainly being going back here sometime soon, probably for my birthday!"}
{"text":"Went to a private event here. Service was amazing! Hilary was very attentive and made sure everything went smoothly. We received top notch service and the food and drinks were delicious. I look forward to returning again!"}
{"text":"I use to work here part time, so I am a little biased BUT the place is always packed. That has to be a great sign.  I use to frequent here for brunch when I wasn't working. Mimosa's are cheap and the brunch is absolutely delicious. I've had the steak and eggs, the spaghetti and meatballs, and the chicken panini sandwich. All the food is good. There are number a number of wines to choose from. Service is great and the chefs are not Italian. Lol. But the food will make you feel like you're in Italy...with a modern twist."}
{"text":"The good:  - Gnocchi appetizer, ridiculously tasty  - Meatballs, second only to Bistro La Bon  - Fennel Sausage Carbonara, beautifully balanced dish  - Braised Lamb Shank, best in town.  - Atmosphere, rarely you see this commitment to aesthetics in Charlotte. Big budget finish out translates to stately or big city feel. You're someplace special   The Bad:  - Service was a little indifferent. Felt like I may be wasting his time at first, but got better mid meal.  - Too many banquettes for a large restaurant. Wanted more space to dine in this environment.  - Were rushed at the end of our meal. Didn't let me set the pace at the end, pet peeve of mine.   Highly recommend.  Request a booth. Plan to overeat."}
{"text":"Visiting Charlotte for the weekend and participated in the Tour de Food event which featured this restaurant. The restaurant was clean, quaint with nice ambience. The food was excellent. They featured the Calamari and Margarita pizza. If you're in the mood for good Italian cuisine, this place is definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"3rd time going to Vivace and went due to having a gift card.  Poor table on side downstairs without any lighting at all so all parties used flashlight app on phone to be able to read menu.  Decent service at beginning of meal but when waiter was shown wiggling bug on bread plate that was fished out of glass of wine - asked if we wanted another glass without concern.  Veal was ok and smothered as if to cover up the taste of veal which was accomplished.  After finishing entrees waiter gone for 15 minutes and then brings check without even offering dessert.  Food just ok and definitely not worth the price.  Much better Italian and/or restaurants in Charlotte."}
{"text":"The Veal entree was a huge disappointment ! Had it in June and it was delicious Last evening , Sept 26th, the Veal was VERY chewy! Making the dish not $22 worthy! The caprese salad was made with roasted , dried tomatoes that was very unusual and not in a good way. No, I did not send it back not wanting to disrupt my dining companions and a pleasant evening  On a positive side, the wait staff was fabulous and yes the dining room is lovely"}
{"text":"So hubby and I went to Vivace for date night a couple weeks ago. I've driven by the place several times but this was our first visit. We started with some sangria and calamari. Both were delicious! He had the lamb shank and I had the oysters, both with risotto. Both entrees were very well made and quite juicy but I think we both preferred the lam over the scallops. The only downside was our waiter, who we found to be kind of awkward in his interactions with us. It is also kind of loud because of all the groups and we practically had to shout for the waiter to hear us. Overall, a good dining experience. We will likely return."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in charlotte. I come here all the time. The view from the patio is peaceful and overlooking charlotte's skyline.  Their food is good . I love their Caesar salad  and don't forget to add salmon!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Food-good to great, ambiance-great. Love bringing friends who haven't seen this place. Very impressive dining in an unexpected locale. :)"}
{"text":"What a difference a new hostess makes. We went back to Vivace and had a wonderful evening....loved the cocktails! The food was delicious and our server was helpful yet unintrusive. Stayed away from the snarky hostess!"}
{"text":"If only the food was as great as everything else.  Atmosphere, service, presentation; all GREAT. But the food is a fail. I've given this place several tries. But I'm done. They changed up the gnocchi appetizer (the primary reason I go). It's no longer the creamy, zaftig sauce with layers of flavor. I received a bowl of below average gnocchi with a thin, watery, broth that was overwhelmed with the taste of charred asparagus. I got the grilled shrimp and lobster ravioli. Same problem. Thin and tasteless broth with no substance of flavor or texture. The veggies on top seemed boiled and did not complement the dish and felt like an afterthought. My friends got the pork and another had the pan seared grouper. They had the same problem. Just kept describing theirs as \"flat\". The food was really disappointing since I go expecting to get something a little special for my money. I understand it's a seasonal menu and lighter in general, but that doesn't mean leaving out taste! Our sever bent over backwards to help us and she could not have been more accommodating. We asked about our items we ordered and she said they were \"keeping the menu fresh\". Ok, that's cool. But keep food up to the same standard as everything else."}
{"text":"This is probably my current favorite Italian restaurant in Charlotte.   Everything was delicious, well presented, and our server was very knowledgable on not only the menu but Italian cuisine overall.  The view is gorgeous and the restaurant decor is upscale.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone!"}
{"text":"My wife and I held a small, casual 3 hour wedding reception for 40 guests. The venue itself is a hidden gem; we reserved the private upstairs bar/dining area, which includes a full bar, TV's, bathrooms, a covered patio with walls that also open up into the bar/dining area if weather permits, and patio heaters if needed! The patio and upstairs bar gives you a clear view of the Charlotte skyline; this makes for a great photo background and our guests from out of town loved it. You cannot beat the location, it was then a 5 minute uber to the bars uptown afterwards.  We reserved the upstairs area at beginning of the year and the management made sure the planning was seamless. Over the course of 8 months until the date, we swapped some emails, completed the meal selections (plenty of options and they were flexible) and at the last minute requested they provide the tablecloths and decorations. It was too easy and truly a stress-free process; we arrived that evening 5-10 minutes late but everything was good to go and the drinks were already pouring! The layout and decorations were perfect, we had the ball game on TV, and an incredibly well stocked bar that would please any beer, liquor or wine snob!  Not only was the food, drink and venue amazing, but the staff working also ensured the evening went smoothly - the first hour consisted of cocktails, seating everyone when it was time to serve dinner and anticipating the needs of all 40 guests. The food was incredible, they offer a 4 course meal if you've got the appetite, and it was impressive how they served a group of 40 served all at the same time with such consistency - kudos to the chef and staff! I'll note that we had guests with allergies or vegetarian requests, all of which they accommodated.  The minimum spend for this venue is incredibly competitive, especially when you consider it is a private dining area with it's own bar, bathrooms, patio with a view of the skyline, and amazing food. We had 4 sets of families, including grandparents at the reception and all were impressed with the facility, food and service.   We're really appreciative of staff that worked and made this all possible; to name a few: our servers/bartenders Dana, Madeline and Tripp; and the management who helped us plan the evening: Scott Giegler, Blythe Baird and Joshua Grogan. And the CHEF John Caputo along with his entire team!  When we find another excuse to throw a party we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great italian place in Charlotte. I consider Charlotte NY's little brother and Vivace would fall in line with that assesment. It's like you were dropped into a nice italian restaurant in NYC. The ambiance is very nice, not overly casual or stuffy. The service was very good and the wine options are fairly decent."}
{"text":"Vegetarians BEWARE! A group of 6 ladies dined at Vivace for Sunday brunch. Our server was clearly inundated with tables as the restaurant appeared to be short staffed. It took our server a while to finally take our drink order and even longer to take our food order. By the time she arrived to take our food order, I politely informed her that I was a vegetarian and to omit any meat from my dishes. I proceeded to order the mushroom/kale omelet and Brussels sprouts. An hour goes by and we still had not rec'd our food. At that point we were starved and asked for some bread.   An hour and a half later, our food arrived however 2 of our guests had left already as they had places to be and did not have time to wait for their food.  As I cut open the kale covered omelet, I did not notice many mushrooms but did notice an odd consistency with the texture. A few bites later, it dawned on me that the 'mushrooms' were in fact pieces of sausage. The omelet was sent back and it was removed off my bill. What's even more upsetting is that the manager could not come to our table to apologize. I can honestly say that this past Sundays poor dining experience will prevent me from dining at Vivace ever again!"}
{"text":"Went here on a date night with my girlfriend. Their bruschetta might ACTUALLY be the best in the city. We also split the pan fried truffle gnocchi salad and it was so delicious and fresh.  We had their bolognese and homemade linguini noodles. The house made pastas are incredible. They fall apart in your mouth. The sauce was perfect, not too heavy for a bolognese which we liked a lot.  Very attentive wait staff and the atmosphere in the dining area is perfect for a date. Overall a GREAT trip and we will be going back again soon!"}
{"text":"As an Italian, I am generally pretty harsh about Italian restaurants and the food they serve. Based on my experience, Vivace is the best Italian restaurant in Charlotte. The service was fantastic, the decor was outstanding (modern and comfortable) and the food was stellar. There was not one item that I didn't think was extraordinarily well prepared. Well done Vivace!"}
{"text":"Toughest veal I ever had,  room was very hot and humid.  Risotto. Itching special"}
{"text":"I have to say the food was AWESOME! The only reason I give this place the rating I did is because of the experience I had with a foreign object in my food...twice.   Half way thru my meal I noticed a piece of metal in my food, luckily I did not eat this but it made me loose my appetite immediately. The server was great and promptly brought over the manager, who was very apologetic. It turned out that the metal was part of the steel wool that they used to clean the pans. They offered to take the food portion off my bill and it was greatly appreciated. They asked me if I would like another dish to take home (as I'd lost my appetite for the evening after almost eating metal) which was a nice gesture and I said yes please, if you'd like me to come back. I left that evening with my next day's lunch in my hands and an overall good opinion of Vivace. I had restaurant experience and am well aware of how these things can happen so didn't hold much against them regarding the unfortunate mishap.   The next day I warmed up half of my take out and half way thru eating ended up with another foreign object in my mouth! This time it turned out to be a flimsy piece of plastic the size of a toothpick! I know that these things happen BUT twice in basically one meal is unacceptable and makes me wonder how many other times something like this has happened here and hasn't been reported.   It's unfortunate that this happened because I really did like Vivace's food, atmosphere and service but I can't eat food from a place that has a hazard of choking on metal and plastic."}
{"text":"First time here-Great space, good music. Bolognese sauce was amazing! Gluten free pasta was under cooked, still edible and I did finish the dish.  I was starving and I never send food back to the kitchen. I did tell the bartender- she didn't care. Her phone was more important.  The kale salad was very good too. The chocolate flourless cake was ok, way to crumbly.   Not sure if I will return."}
{"text":"Oh I wanted to like this place - really, really I did - interior wise - awesome, server wise - ditto - but the food - was so disappointing - bland spaghetti, absolutly no taste, bread was extremly doughy and barely warm.  As much as our server raved about the food, we were not impressed at all.  Pricey for the amount of food you receive and I can not stress enough that the quality is just average -"}
{"text":"I love this place! My first experience there was their Easter brunch. Hands down the best frittata and sangria I ever had! My girl friends and I still come there most Sundays for their bottomless mimosas. Yum yum! When the weather starts getting warmer their patio is the perfect spot to eat and enjoy friends!"}
{"text":"This is Charlotte's best new restaurant. Rarely does a restaurant have the caliber of service given at Vivace. Food, wine, decor (Italian blown glass red lanterns), ambiance, all excellent."}
{"text":"I heard fantastic things about Vivace Charlotte and was excited to try to new brunch menu. 2 friends and I made a reservation, (it was CIAA weekend and we thought it would be very busy so we planned ahead.)  Once seated, it took a few min for someone to great us, which is pretty normal considering the amount of people that were arriving for brunch. Finally our server came over, introduced the menu and introduced the new $25.00 brunch menu. She advised that the bottomless drinks are ONLY available if we take the 25.00 option and if not we would pay full price for each drink. None of us were that hungry to have 2 full dishes but thought, \"hey we can enjoy 25.00 worth of mimosa's\"   I ordered a mimosa with grapefruit and was told it was an up-charge for each one to add grapefruit. I advised that I medically can't have OJ and asked that they simply replace it, and was told no. I asked for just champagne and was told, \"No, everything is pre-made\" So I opted for the bloody mary bar, which I enjoyed very much!!  It was a good choice.   For more on the drinks, not sure if it was because the volume of people or a restaurant rule, but we waited about 15-20 min to order a second drink, we even had to ask a different server since ours seemed to be to concerned with her 2 tables of 6+ people. Even after ordering we had to wait another 10 min to get the drink so we ate our food - (which was average) without beverages (including water). After another 20 min we tried to order a third drink, and were ignored. Finally our waitress came over and we asked for the third drink, she apologized and said it was on the way, 10 min later still no drinks. We finally flagged her down, asked about the drinks and she looked confused and said, \"no-one brought them?\"  At that point (1 hour 30min into brunch) we just asked for the checks. Needless to say we were bummed that we didn't get the enjoy the\"bottomless\" alcohol as advertised. (not that we drink that much but it was a bit upsetting)  Once the bill came, we started to pay and my friend pointed out that the brunch was not $25.00 as stated on the menu and by our server, it was actually 27.52 plus tax, which made the bill $29.79. At that point, my table of friends became very annoyed. We paid our bills and waited to speak with the manager on duty about the $2.52 difference in the check. Granted, it's only $2.52 but if everyone in the restaurant that day had the $25.00 advertised brunch but were really charged, $27.52 that s HUGE increase towards profit. We spoke to the manager about the price difference and he said he was sorry that this was a new process and the computer systems were not updated yet, they have been only doing this for 2 weeks, so basically overcharging customers for 2 weeks. Again $2.52 isn't a huge deal for 1 person but say you have 400 patrons over 2 weeks at $2.52 that's $1008.00 extra in overcharges. The manager again apologized and offered to credit us the $2.52. We were already out the door and said never mind, but we just wanted to bring it to his attention. Other people may not be as nice about it.  The owner Kevin Jennings emailed me about participating in a program with Vivace and asked me for my candid feedback. To which I sent the above in a email and I never heard back from him or anyone in their corporate office."}
{"text":"Food was over cooked, rushed, and underwhelming. Large birthday party was poorly waited on and staff was forgetful. It was clear that the restaurant couldn't handle a busy night with large parties.  Calamari- heavily breaded and chewy, clearly over cooked. Spaghetti and meatballs- who can screw this up? Two people in our party ordered the same dish and looked completely different. One with hardly any sauce and quickly throw together.  Steak was over cooked.  Waitstaff- they can only place 8 orders at once and we had 16 people. The food arrived for half our party and we were informed that the other 8 did not get entered and the kitchen had to scramble to get the others out 20 mins later. The manager came to the table to apologize, but only spoke to one person at the end of the table, with a party of 16 you would expect more."}
{"text":"Sadly I have to give a poor rating to this restaurant which was in my top 5 for charlotte. This past experience has permanently removed it from the list of places I will spend my money. I am very tolerant of set backs and mistakes but when it happens not by chance it warrants this type of review. My reservation was for 12 people to welcome a friend back to charlotte for an outside cabana this past weekend. On arrival we were told all we have left is this one table, without an umbrella, that seats 5. Promptly we asked to speak  with the manager on this Sunday who unapologetically explained that they changed their policy regarding reserving cabanas. We never received a call explaining this prior to our arrival but were left with option of a table inside or outside which would only accommodate 5. We sat waiting for the rest of the party before making other arrangements despite the fact as we went outside there were not one but 2 tables with reserved signs on them. The rest of the meal went as badly as it started. The waitress I can forgive as she was new and obviously overwhelmed. But it must be noted that food and drink was slow even for a busy Sunday. By time our appetizers arrived, over an hour later, the sun was to high for us to remain outside at the only table without an umbrella, so we made our way inside. Out entrees arrived after being read off and placed in front of what we assumed was the correct person. My eggs were well done but cold. Two others they mistakenly gave the wrong dishes too. This normally wouldn't be a big except the waiter specifically asked who has frittata with shrimp and gave it to the wrong person. After taking a bite and eating shrimp (which upset me as a nurse because that individual could have been highly allergic) we then found out it was another persons meal. Followed by another taking a bite of there food to end up with a bug on her lip! That sealed the deal on this lack luster experience. We promptly asked our waitress who was apologetic to speak to the manager. Unsure whether or not we can use names on this site, lets just say the manager on Sunday is in need of further training on how to provide good customer service. From the moment we explained our \"current\" issues he immediately started providing excuses. Never once was he apologetic. After the bug dealer breaker which we informed him ended our meal and uneaten food he informs us he will take care of our bill. With that we made our way out to find a restaurant where we could eat.  Half way down the block the same manager ran after us stating \"I took care of the food but you still have a drink bill\". We informed him we thought he meant out bill in its entirety was taken care of and proceed back towards the restaurant to pay for our drinks. Another member of the party let the manager dispute the poor service what made the experience intolerable was his attitude towards us. He immediately again went on the defensive, provided excuses and concluded with his attitude was a reaction to  being cornered by one of the gentlemen in our party regarding the seating issue when we first arrived. Prior to this moment I would have called this a one off or vivace. After hearing this we realized our poor service and meals were most likely on purpose due to the bias of the manager of the day.  He felt \"cornered\" .....in the lobby entrance of the restaurant ....as manager who is suppose to field issues and problems??? I hate saying this as I feel very disheartened witnessing this type of behavior but the only reason I can conclude for him feeling this way was because we were minorities. I can pretty much safely make this conclusion based on the passive aggressive nature of this rest of our meal.  As well as recalling an incident that occurred on my birthday dinner a year prior that involved wrong seating as well. That night resulted in a round of prosecco for the table. Same incident two different reactions. One difference....the ethnicity of the patrons. I'm sad to see vivace off of my list of places to visit  and recommend but the unrecognized/unchecked bias by management was too insulting to ignore. Embarrassed by what I presumed to be an upscale establishment to have such low standards for its treatment of its patrons I will not make the mistake of recommending it to any of my friends or colleagues."}
{"text":"We had a large group of girls for a birthday dinner. We had 2 people waiting on our table. The girl was super sweet and hopeful, the guy was not. In fact, he was rude. Not sure if this was an off night for him, but I wasn't a fan of his remarks or comments. He acted as if we were inconveniencing him.  The food was pretty good. I know my girlfriends enjoyed their meals as well."}
{"text":"Very nice location and fantastic view of the city. The patio area was a great place to sit out side and enjoy our meal and drinks. It is a bit pricey and I would say pricier than the review systems lead you to believe. However it has very unique options and a few common choices for pickier eaters. Overall a great place. The only negative I would say is the bread. Seemed to be lacking for the type of place this is."}
{"text":"A very beautiful NY, LA level decor. The food was less than inspiring but the service and layout made up for a lot of that. I think that the meats on there menu can use some better seasoning combinations because it was entirely too mild. Other than that its a great addition to Charlotte cuisine and I will be back."}
{"text":"I will never go back. Me and a friend sat on the patio one evening and not one person came up to us. Several waitresses walked past us several times and did not say a word. We sat there for over 10 minutes before I got up to get a manager. A waiter decided to argue and say me and my friend were being helped which was a complete lie. The manager told me to go have a seat back at the table. Overall nothing was done. No apology, nothing. I emailed another manager the next day about the experience and guess what, no response."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Great food and Wine collection. They have a very modern feel and very classy restaurant. Love the upstairs patio. Been out on it twice (friends rented it) and the customer service was wonderful. Check out the upstairs next time you're in the area. Great spot!"}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of Vivace, but this new spring menu is blowing my mind-- definitely worth going in to check out. A few of my favorite highlights?  -Cheese plate offerings- Crucolo Trentino? Where else can you find that outside of Alto Adige? FINALLY a chef that isn't just dialing in his cheese selection (no more Maytag blue, pleeease.)  -LOVE the chilled hazelnut soup with muscadine granita-- what a cool (get it ha) and delicious way to incorporate something SO quintessential North Carolina with Italian ingredients -- local meets tradition!  -One app is simply house churned butters and homemade bread -- need I say more?  All the pasta dishes are lovely - mostly due to the fact that they are cooked and seasoned properly, and not overly intricate- LOVE that they come in two sizes too so that you can share....or not..  I usually just share a bunch of the small plates with friends (who doesn't love to eat like that?) but if I do get a main entree it would have to be the NC Triggerfish. The sweet corn and nutty farro ragout that the fish rests upon could be a meal in itself - especially with the grilled oyster mushrooms that also accompany the dish. Add that fresh, sweet, mild fish atop and you're in for a memorable dinner.   Usually you don't get lucky and get great food AND a good wine list -- which is why Vivace got the 5th star for me. All Italian, a lot of small family owned producers, unusual grapes you don't typically see (think Cococciola from Abruzzo--a yummy crisp white) and most importantly -- NOT at every other restaurant in Charlotte.  Not to mention with the design of the restaurant you can't help but feel sexy while sipping whatever little libation you choose...  Looking forward to my next visit!!!"}
{"text":"Here's to my very first Yelp review!  Here goes nothing!  So, I've been in Charlotte for a little over a year now, and with the exception of Villa Antonio, I have yet to find a decent Italian restaurant.  Wanting to celebrate my girlfriends B-Day in style, I made a reservation for two at Vivace / uptown Charlotte.  Not wanting to dine in a 'dead restaurant' I had specifically asked them how busy they tend to be on a weeknight.  The hostess was nice enough to check their reservations and let me know that they had a few large parties and the place turned out to be pleasantly busy for a Wednesday.  The atmosphere was very cool, with music, two bars (one upstairs and one downstairs), and no shortage of lounge seating to enjoy a drink with friends.  One area on the upper deck had VERY nice views of the Charlotte skyline.  I didn't see their drink menu so I can't comment on price, but, it seems a cool place to go even if you aren't necessarily hungry.  But, hungry we were!    As soon as we sat down our waiter dropped a nice bread basket.  Made in-house.  We ordered two appetizers;  Calamari with Spicy tomato aioli and Gnocchi with shrimp, pancetta, corn crema & arugula.  The gnocchi was OUT.OF.CONTROL!  On the other hand, the calamari was perfectly run of the mill, but, at only $10 bucks, it's not going to offend anyone.  If I have to say one thing about the calamari; there's a LOT of it!   My main course was the pan seared pork chop which comes over grilled sausage, ciambotta, parmesan polenta, and fried capers.  This pork chop was a game changer!  Order it how you like, but, medium-rare was how I ordered it.  At first I didn't think I'd be able to finish it, but, I persevered.  My girlfriend needed help finishing her Seared Scallop Risotto with spinach, spicy capicola, & cherry pepper crema.  Me being the gentleman that I am, helped her polish it off.  I'll vouch for the both of us that it was NO JOKE!  The portions were very generous and the presentation was great!    When making my reservation, I just mentioned that it was my girlfriends birthday and without bringing it up again, they brought out a mint chocolate ice cream, on the house.  It was great!  When we were done, we asked our waiter if he could take our picture on their 2nd floor terrace overlooking the city.  He obliged.  All-in-all, GREAT night out!"}
{"text":"Horrible service and the food lacked taste and was  over priced! Our server Everette had a party of six next to our table that he obviously was very concerned about the drunken party than us!  It took forever for our food to come out. The manager came over to ask how was our food and I said I didn't know yet as it took a long time for it to come out. He said it shouldn't have taken that long and he would check back. He never came back!  The worse hour and a half of my life that I will never get back! The best part was the valet parking!  I am a fan of non chain restaurants but I was very disappointed and would not recommend. The service at Maggianos and even Olive Garden is better than Vivace and even the food is better there!!!"}
{"text":"On a Thursday night, the place was nearly empty. Yet still extremely understaffed with our waiter running upstairs, outside and inside. Drink orders (beer) took well over 15 minutes.  For the last round, we had actually forgotten we ordered it! By the time it came we had just been waiting for the waiter to show up so we could get the check and leave. We all happened to order pizzas ($16 each and the cheapest item on the menu) and they were all bad. Under cooked and cold, soggy crust, etc. Didn't have the heart to mention two members of our party were there for their birthdays because we didn't want to continue to wait for something else. Two hours for pizza and beer was simply just too much. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Came here for my 21st birthday and they refused to serve me even though I was 2 days over 21. Beside that, the food is delicious, and the service for the most part is acceptable."}
{"text":"2nd visit this time for a full meal.   Delightful! We sat upstairs with a gorgeous view of the skyline. Our server was fabulous. Every part of the food was good, bread to dessert. My caesar salad was amazing, it's hard to be wowed by salad but they did it.   It is very loud.   Looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"Vivace was excellent. I started with a side mixed green salad which was very tasty, not too large, not too small. Then, I had the sea scallop risotto for my entree and the swallows were cooked just right; the risotto was just the right consistency. The flavor was great as it needed no salt or pepper. I liked that the restaurant offered small portions as it allowed me room for dessert. Of course I had to try the tiramisu which was delicious. In addition to the food, the atmosphere and service was awesome. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"Beautiful ambiance, food ws delicious, prompt and well presented. Complimentary Valet parking. Clearly will go again when traveling back to Charlotte. Also convenient reservation system trough the Yelp links."}
{"text":"Had great dinner and service this past Friday evening at Vivace.  Had my 2yr old son and our server was great with him.  The new menu provided the best meal my wife and I have had at this restaurant.  Really happy for them.  I'm super critical and not easily please but they hit it out of the park.  My wife loved her salmon and my swordfish was on the more savory side just to my liking.  This has been the best italian meal i've had in Charlotte for 9 years.  Great Job."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and the food is not good. The pizza tastes like a frozen pizza and their spaghetti and meatballs tastes like a throwback to spaghettios. We were served room temperature coffee at the end of the meal which capped it off. I won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Blah food. I went this past Sunday with a group of friends for restaurant week. I never knew the waitress name until the check came and I read it on the ticket. She was the worst! The restaurant was out of every item I wanted. Scallops, calamari, swordfish, sangria. I ordered a drink and when I was finished the waitress just took the glass away didn't even offer another one. The entire staff just seemed miserable. My friend order the chocolate gelato and found something in it (no wonder why theyhave a 92.5 health score). We didn't  see the manager going around doing table touches like they do in most nice places. We couldn't get out of there fast enough! Don't waste your time or money at this place."}
{"text":"This has been on of my favorite spots in Charlotte with good food and service. That said on my recent visit they took away one of the best attributes of Vivace. The view.  Their entire upstairs bar, seating area and balcony was closed all night. This is a key attraction for my visits so closing off the great view of Uptown Charlotte left a negative mark, particularly when my reservation requested that area and they never told me it would be closed until I arrived. Bad form."}
{"text":"The swordfish special last evening was Superb ! My husband had the swordfish.  It was moist and tender. How did I know?  Because I tasted it !   I was leary of ordering it myself as I hadn't had good experiences with swordfish elsewhere.   It was Awesome and I sneeked another bite or two as dinner went on.  The best mussels I've had the pleasure to eat . My bolonese never dissapoints me.. Loved it !   Desserts were fabulous !!  A most pleasurable dining experience !!   Service was top knotch :)   Definitely on my Favorites list."}
{"text":"Place is modern and nice. The Scallops risotto I order was good and well presented. Little in pricier side. The service was very good.. 3 1/2 starts for me."}
{"text":"My husband and I took my father-in-law here for his 60th birthday.  We sat upstairs and to my surprise an entire wall can open up so it almost felt like we were outside.  The atmosphere was better than I had expected.  As the sun went down one side of the table had major sun in their eyes so if they can put up some shades for that 30 minutes of intense sun, it would be perfect.  There are also couches up on the 2nd floor patio with a great view of the city.  The food was great.  We had the meat and cheese sampler, which was fun and delicious, as well as the homemade ricotta to start.  Yum.  My smoked chicken agnolotti was amazing.  My husband's papardelle was just as delicious.  We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but I loved this place!  The gnocchi was great, the veal saltimbocca was great and the service was good.  The management was helpful and polite.  I wasn't expecting to be a fan.  I had heard mixed reviews and I'm glad to say the restaurant was outstanding.  I'm definitely a fan."}
{"text":"As others have mentioned -- this is the best new place in Charlotte.  It's also not your standard run of the mill Italian restaurant as mentioned -- this is much better.  Everything hand made in house -- they age their meats and cheese, make their pasta, etc.  The interior design is fantastic, unlike anything in Charlotte.  The view from the second floor is great -- do yourself a favor and head to the 2nd floor for a look or glass of wine outside with a beautiful view of downtown.  The outdoor seating will be awesome during the right time of the year--Charlotte needs something like this.  The food is fantastic, but the service is what sets this place apart -- very knowledgeable staff and very attentive without being overbearing.  Great selection of wines and handcrafted Italian beers -- try some of them.  I've been there 4 times since they opened -- live close by.  The 4-cheese ravioli is amazing, the pizzas--for $10-- are a steal; as mentioned by another -- the mussels are great.  Try the sweet potato gnocchi -- unbelievable, melt in your mouth and for $7 with a big bowl full--a great deal.  Also, tried the housemade ricotta & lemon marmelatta -- wouldn't be my first choice but went with server's suggestion -- it was amazing -- so flavorful, give it a try.  Had the housemade gelatos, which were fantastic and again, a great value.  Overall, you need to go here and treat yourself -- you won't be disappointed -- great atmosphere and style and very good value.  Would give it 6 stars if available."}
{"text":"Have no complaints at all. Not one.  We had a friends-and-family gathering there to celebrate our wedding a few months earlier for those who couldn't make it to the actual wedding. We had the downstairs rented out for lunch time and the layout was very nice. The food was excellent. The service was great. Everyone at the party (about 60 people) commented favorably on the food, service, and location. I would definitely use them again for any event."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for Vivace, which probably set me up for the large disappointment it turned out to be.  This is my second visit to Vivace; I don't remember much about the first visit, but I didn't think it was bad, so I decided to come here for a graduation celebration this past weekend. Boy, was that a mistake! The service was appalling and the food was lackluster.  I had a reservation for 9:30p on a Saturday. Two members from my party of seven arrived on time, and the rest arrived about 5-10 minutes later. After about ten minutes, our waiter, Jeffrey, came over to fill (and refill) our glasses and take our orders. Now, I realize Vivace isn't like other restaurants, but it would have been nice if they would have laid out some bread or something while we waited 45 minutes for our food to arrive. That's right. Forty-five. Minutes. What the deuce. We even contemplated leaving and just going to Wendy's down the road. I understand it was a Saturday night and we had a party of 7, but by golly it was not that crowded in there! And to add insult to hunger, our (not so) lovely waiter Jeffrey (and one other person) stopped by two, maybe three times the whooole night to refill our water glasses. Once we got our food, Jeffrey didn't even stop by again to ask how it was or see if we needed anything. So since Jeffrey failed to perform his due diligence, I'll tell him through Yelp...  The food was average at best. I ordered two appetizers for my meal (again, took 45 minutes to arrive), calamari and mussels. They were alright. Nothing remarkable about them.  My parents ordered the Grilled Salmon ($21). When it arrived at our table, the first question every one asked was, \"Where's the rest of it?\" Those little itty bitty pieces of salmon were at most 3oz! A little piece of salmon rested on a just-as-small bed of undercooked beans. My mom was pretty irate about it, so I told her to ask for something else, but I'm sure you all know about the possible tale of angry cooks/waiters. And on top of that, it probably would have taken another 30 minutes to arrive... My dad noted that that was one of the few times he arrived at a restaurant hungry and left just as hungry.  The veal was \"okay.\"  Only one member of our group of seven was satisfied with their meal. One. He ordered the lamb, if you're curious.  Throughout the night, I noticed a couple that sat at the table next to us. They arrived after us and received their cocktails and meals before we did. I believe Jeffrey was also their waiter since he was at their table more than he was at ours.  After we were done eating, it took another 20-25 minutes for Jeffrey to stop by our table again, and I had to hail Jeffrey over after he hastily handed out the dessert menus so that I could ask for our check.  All together, we spent almost $200 for that miserable dinner, which we waited an unreasonable amount of time for. It was a waste of money! There was a mandatory 20% gratuity on our bill because we had over five individuals at our table (even though we were on two separate bills). 20% is ridiculous for terrible service.  I felt terrible that I brought my family, who came here from out of state and curious about Charlotte, to Vivace only to be disappointed with their overpriced, average, and untimely meal.  On a positive note, the restaurant has great interior design. But on another negative, it is sooo loud in there. Yeesh.  Vivace, you do not have to worry about me returning here again. I would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Came highly recommended, but we were disappointed. I had the duck, which was fairly tasty, but tough. My wife had the veal, which was ok, but nothing to rave about. Expensive for the quality of food. Service was acceptable, but nothing special. Maybe our expectations were just too high."}
{"text":"Pretty good. The bread with bean dip and gelato were excellent. I had the ravioli, it was alright. I defiantly expected something more. Not sure if I would come back or not."}
{"text":"I love Vivace.  Atmosphere is great.  Great to have a beautiful, reliable medium priced winner.  Airy with cool contemporary decor.  The upstairs bar has extended season outdoor seating and great views of the skyline.  Lunch is bargain, everything on the menu is good.  They rotate their risotto seasonally (they do it right) the salmon is always a safe bet.  The short ribs fall off the bone.  The pasta (house made) Bolognese with goat cheese cream is rich and great every time. Love that they offer half portions of pasta as a starter for dinner or as a light bite."}
{"text":"I'll give my bad before the good. We had a large group (12 people) and they definitely did not give us a server that knew how to handle a reservation of that size.  They were slow to get us our drinks (and we were thirsty!) and they COMPLETELY messed up our bill and did not take responsibility for it.  Okay, now the good!  Food and dirty martinis were fantastic!  Gnocchi was awesome, meatballs were wonderful, muscles were banging, duck was a bit too salty but other garnishes yummy, and ambiance was fantastic - chic but not stuck up.  Would definitely go back here whether it be just for drinks or for a full meal."}
{"text":". If you go out for authentic Italian food this restaurant is not for you. We started with the pizza, the crust is like a wafer & had a fig sauce. The pasta stuffed with chicken & roasted garlic  with cream sauce was very bland & was  topped with arugula salad . . The spaghetti with bolognese sauce was mixed with goat cheese . Strange combination. The server  was attentive.  The wine list was very big & expensive"}
{"text":"Food was great!! We had the mussels and salmon.  Great views, but it was rainy and foggy when we were there.    The negatives: very loud, rude hostess."}
{"text":"My date and i arrived to Vivace and were greeted by the friendly valet. We entered into a romantic atmosphere and finally realized what all the hype was about. Our bartender, Hillary was not only friendly and informative but suggested wines based on our obscure hints. We then were sat at a cozy table with beautiful candle light and a very romantic ambiance. We instantly fell on love with Ashley, our server. She was educated on the features ( I devoured a scrumptious soft shell crab ) Ashley made us fall in love with Vivace. Both she and Hillary gave us superior service beyond compare and also raved about their management and owners. This spoke volumes to both me and my date; as business owners ourselves. We will absolutely return. Tried the Duck Gnocchi.....best in town! We are hooked. If you get an opportunity, see Hillary for unrivalled Italian wines and absolutely see Ashley for royal service! Great date spot! 5*"}
{"text":"Vivace is a visually pleasing place to go for an upscale or moderately priced meal.  There are pasta and entree options priced in the teens to 20s.  The pizza is a little bit more affordable and would be great enjoyed in their outdoor spaces on a nice afternoon.    The space is my favorite part.  Lots of nice things to look at - modern wood paneling, big orange chandeliers, high ceilings and more.  The outdoor spaces are pretty lux and streamlined as well.  The food was good.  I got a chance to try the calamari, which was served in a large portion with sauteed red pepper slices and the gnocchi with shrimp (rich and delicious!).  The melon and prosciutto salad was excellent.  For entree I got the chili capellini and lump crab.  It was a little spicy and was good, but I wasn't amazed and thought it was outshined by the gnocchi I started with.  I preferred my friend's sweet corn and potato agnolotti with smoked chicken.  I thought it was interesting that they stuffed the pasta with the sweet corn.  Service was pretty good.  Our waitress was helpful and friendly and great at keeping our drinks refilled.  The entrees took a while to come out, which was strange since the place wasn't that crowded."}
{"text":"Vivace is always a solid choice. Great location. Service is hit or miss, especially in the bar/lounge area. Evening ambiance is great. Fun for group outings and date night. They have a wonderful patio with city views that sits right along the Little Sugar Creek Greenway. For these reasons, it's a lovely place to bring out of town family and friends. Brunch is decent but remember you can't get a drink until noon (they open at 11.) Favorite meals are the Tuscan Kale Salad with Salmon, Fried Oysters, Pappardelle and Ribeye. Love their wine list- try the Talamonti red, white or rose by the glass ($8-$9.) When the valet isn't available (usually weekdays) parking can be a pain. Will continue to dine at Vivace as their food is always delicious."}
{"text":"Menu is great and flexible !! Dam is awesome server!! the atmosphere is very hip and clean!! great vibe of people and great attitude's!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I finally decided to check out Vivace for brunch. I will go on the record and say that this place is now my favorite Sunday brunch spot!!  We arrived right at 12 and realized we should have made a reservation. Fortunately, they were able to squeeze us in at a spot upstairs (excellent city views). For $25 you get bottomless mimosas and bloody marys and then an appetizer and a main.   Throughout the whole meal, the drinks were flowing. I opted for mimosas and my husband the bloody. They just had pitchers and would keep refilling!  For appetizer, I got the baked oysters and my husband got the meatballs. The oysters were absolutely fantastic. Baked with cheese and some small lobster bites. The meatballs were equally as tasty and the sauce was perfect. For mains, I got the shrimp and grits and my husband got the fried chicken and gravy sandwich. The shrimp and grits were very good....large shrimp! However, we both decided that the chicken and gravy sandwich was the winner. Excellent combination of flavors!   So excited that we discovered this brunch as it will definitely be a regular spot!"}
{"text":"We went here for brunch this past weekend and I was so disappointed :(.  I was so excited to try this place out and I brunch is my favorite meal ever, so I thought it would be great.  The brunch menu looks really good and it was gorgeous weather out so we were able to sit outside.    The meal started off well - we got the Bruschetta app.  It was so different, but good different.  It had cauliflower on it and it just tasted good.  I ordered the open face panino for my entree.  It was sooo rich and heavy.  The cheese sauce was so overpowering and salty and my food was drenched in it, so it wasn't the best... Two people we went with ordered the grilled hanger steak entree.  Both steaks had significant amounts of char/burnt edges on it.  No one was overly impressed.  Also, just as a side note, we all forgot that you can't order alcohol before 12 on Sundays and we overheard a lot of other tables trying to order mimosas and stuff as well.  I was kind of disappointed to have brunch without a mimosa, but not their fault that's the law.  I wish we went at 12 instead of 11 though."}
{"text":"Being that I am very Savvy international travelers.  1 star And I will explain why:  1- This is NOT Italian food. 2- Lobster Ravioli with trace, taste or smell of lobster. 3- Overpriced 4- Nothing Italian about the  ...atmosphere ...decoration or even the music. 5- I tasted 4 different menu items...plus the a desert...still found nothing Italian!   A bunch of patrons in flip flops and shorts dining in...explains the identity crisis of this place.  Waiter was ..meh.. Whatever.. I would never return  Good Luck Chef!  Owner: I suggest that you fly to Rome for few days and discover Italian food."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the cleanliness. For the price of the experience the last thing anyone dining wants to see is dust the completely covers the THREE gigantic lighting fixtures dangling over our food. Will revisit just to see if they are clean."}
{"text":"The restaurant and staff was very good. Nice, new place with knowledgeable and friendly servers. The food was ok, but I have had about the same quality food at Olive Garden. Charlotte really needs a very good Italian restaurant and this place failed to deliver."}
{"text":"Love a lot about the place! Seated on the patio late afternoon and it was a gorgeous view of uptown. Service was good through dinner. Server did a great job helping with wine selections by the glass.   Disappointed in the wood fired pizza. Not crispy crust as stated on the menu. Just the opposite really. Baked more like a thin cake dough. I was okay with that but not impressed that our server did not pick up on the fact, even though I ate everything but the crust. Even more disappointed that after I mentioned it he had nothing, NOTHING to say. I asked him to please pass on my comments to the chef. Still, Nothing! Tipped him well and left. I will go back!"}
{"text":"OMG BRUNCH!!! If I could go here every weekend, I would 100%!   The Vivace Way .. bottomless mimosas, bloody marys, an antipasta, and entrée! It's just too good to be true!   Make reservations if you can. Arrive on the earlier side of brunch to get a table outside and to avoid the inevitable lines and waits (worth every second though).   If you're looking for traditional eggs and potatoes, this isn't for you. Their menu (is fantastic) is Italian so the dishes are heavier and hearty. I always get the brussel sprouts and potatoes for my antipasta (mmmm) and the shrimp and grits for my entrée. Both are so good and I always leave with a to go box.   Writing this review is making me want to go to brunch now so I'm going to stop here to make a reservation. :)"}
{"text":"I signed up for Yelp today just to write this review. Let me first preface this by saying that I am incredibly high maintenance when it comes to food, especially food that is a little more on the expensive side.  The first time I came to Vivace was for brunch on Feb 1st. They have a cool menu that is $25 for one appetizer or salad, one entree, and unlimited blood mary's/mimosas. I started off with the BEST Caprese Salad i've ever had in my life. Seriously. Hands down. I joined yelp and am writing this review mainly because of that salad. Order it. You won't regret it. 2nd course was Spaghetti & Meatballs which I would say are slightly above average. Homemade pasta made it good but the sauce wasn't anything to write home about. The service was excellent, pricepoint was fair, and they kept the mimosas flowing. (i think we had close to five a piece and the waitress didn't make me feel weird or bad about it!)  Now the real reason why I am taking the time to write this review is because on Feb 2nd, one day after brunch, I was craving that Caprese I hadn't stopped talking about for over 24 hours. My boyfriend asked me if I wanted him to pick it up on his way home for me for dinner. WHAT A GREAT IDEA!! :-)   What I found when he got home made me love this place even more! I had been hesitant about ordering this particular salad to-go because of all the components but figured I would give it a shot. What I found when I opened the to-go box was an order that had been so meticulously and carefully packaged. All 3 of the sauces that come on the caprese were on the side in little containers & they even sent some bread and delicious roasted garlicky buttery hummus with the order as well. As soon as I opened the box, I looked at my boyfriend and sighed and said \"this place just gets me.\" and its true.  I was incredibly impressed by not only my dine-in experience, but just as much if not moreso, my takeout experience. This place GETS IT. They understand the importance of offering quality ingredients, a pricepoint that makes sense, and a n unparalleled, keen attention to detail.   I would definitely, HIGHLY, recommend this place for brunch, dinner, takeout, dine-in, whatever!!"}
{"text":"I don't like to write totally negative reviews, ever. However, I had the most unpleasant experience at Vivace yesterday and felt compelled to do so. I frequent Vivace in Raleigh quite often, love the sangria, love the atmosphere, and figured it would be worth it to give the Charlotte restaurant a try. The food was delicious and the atmosphere is wonderful, if not as intimate as Raleigh's.   The service on the other hand? Horrendous. Our waitress barely stopped by throughout the meal, didn't seem to care if we were interested in another round of drinks, and had an attitude that was horrific. I asked to substitute chicken for the scallops in the risotto, as I am not a fan of seafood at all, and was actually told by her that I was \"ruining the dish:\" Vivace is no five star restaurant in Manhattan, and even if it was, I would not expect such a rude comment to ever be made to a patron. Having been a server myself, I was floored she would even make that comment out loud.   The chicken, by the way, was absolutely delicious and the dish was too. Will not be going back though. I can spend my money somewhere else where I won't get abrasive input."}
{"text":"I love this place and can't wait to return!  This was my first stop on my restaurant week expedition. I came here with two other ladies and it was all of our first times' and we couldn't have left more pleased.  The service was outstanding! We had a little trouble picking out a bottle of wine and our server recommended a bottle that would satisfy all three of our wine pallets.   I was very satisfied with the portion size's here. I thought for restaurant week they might be a little smaller..nope not here! I got the little neck clams to start. The clams were so flavorful! Such unique flavors, uh I loved them. Next was the prosciutto-wrapped pork tenderloin with sage gnocchi, roasted garlic crema, tomato polenta. Ahhh, so delicious! Great presentation.  And lastly, the black and white tiramisu. It was perfect!  I can't wait to come back! I am looking forward to sitting outside and enjoying their patio this summer!"}
{"text":"I live in new bern NC and I come to Charlotte on the weekends to spend time with my significant other , we always come to brunch here on Saturday and Sundays because they have the best deal on bottomless mimosas, and great food . But this weekend was one of the worst experience I have ever had , my service was horrible I literally waited 20 mins or more on a refill I do understand they are busy but it gets annoying when you see the table beside you getting drinks and great service and your not ."}
{"text":"This place has poor quality food. No beer on draft. Some of the food tasted like it was frozen. The food quality is on par with Applebee's.  The service was good. However, I would not recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"One pokestop as of 7/2016. I've only been there for brunch but I love it. They endless mimosas or bloody Marys...yum. I love the braised short rib hash and meatballs. Great outdoor seating."}
{"text":"After seeing all the rave reviews for Vivace on here I was stoked to check it out, even though I feel like I'm the last person to try it.   The night: A rainy evening that was perfect for warm, filling Italian food. Being a weeknight, the bar was more crowded than the dining room and throughout my time there, only saw three or four other tables.   The drinks:The wine list is sick!! If you can't find vino you like, you are smoking the good stuff since they offer just about everything under the sun. I opted for the red sangria and it was absolute perfection. It wasn't entirely sweet but more tart and in my world, that's perfection. Next time I will be back to try one of their Italian Mojitos (they offer different flavors such as Blackberry, Pineapple, Lime and more)   The food: They first brought us out bread to nibble on while we were waiting for our food. Instead of olive oil or butter, they brought out a cannellini bean dip that reminded me of a lighter, thinner hummus. The menu has a decent sized selection where you can scan then have one thing catch your eye but then you keep looking (so you won't have order remorse) and find another scrumptious sounding dish. I absolutely love that they offer smaller portions on their pasta dishes (pasta is made in house) since there is no such thing as portion control in many restaurants these days. I ordered the small portion of Short Braised Ribs with fettuccine, apples, swiss chard and a few other goodies that I can't remember. When they brought it out, I kinda pointed out they brought me out the wrong dish and our server told me that was the dish I ordered (I blame it on the sangria). The apples resembled mini scallops at first and there wasn't much braised rib to be seen. I was a bit bummed about that but it ended up being a delicious entree with a light, brown sauce.   The service: From working in the restaurant industry and visiting many dining establishments, this is probably in my top 10% tier of best service I've ever had.   The verdict: I liked it alot. I can't say it's my favorite Italian place in Charlotte yet. They offer a more modern spin on Italian cuisine and I guess I'm a more traditional girl (who knew??) but am definitely happy Vivace is here to offer a different take on Italian. I will definitely come back to Vivace though!"}
{"text":"Overall as far as brunch spots go I'd consider this one fairly average. Nothing was bad by any means, but nothing particularly stood out to me or blew me away like other spots I visited while touring Charlotte. However, while i didn't necessarily think any of their food was particularly special, they have a fun bottomless brunch idea where you can interchange between mimosas and bloody Marys, have an appetizer and an entree all for 30$, which makes you feel as if you're truly getting your bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Alright, I recently gave them another chance since they had been my go to place to eat in Charlotte.   I have to say, I was much more impressed since my not so hot experience. This time may have been just what I needed to bring me back. Heather & Scott really made it a memorable and enjoyable time.   Bread- love the thick slices and butter!   Hendrick & soda- heavenly! Made perfectly!!   Fettuccini Alfredo with the strozzapreti pasta - delicious!!!!!   My friend got a sea food plate- she loved it!"}
{"text":"I've had three wonderful experiences at Vivace. One was at a sunday brunch (hello, bottomless mimosas!) the other happy hour (5 dollar appetizers from 4 to 6) and the other on a busy saturday night for dinner. Each experience was very positive. The service is always on point. The wait staff is very friendly, but they leave you alone and don't linger. The cocktails and wine list are really wonderful. I haven't had anything I didn't like. The best meal that stands out in my mind is the  fig and prosciutto pizza. We loved it so much each time that we ordered two. The mussels are also delicious. The ambiance inside and outside are nice. If you can, sit outside on a nice summer night! The couches and pillows are super comfy!"}
{"text":"I travel a lot, and I admit - I've made this mistake before. I scope out restaurants on Yelp! near where I'm going to stay, and then I get attached to a menu item, despite the gentle hints from the hotel staff that there might be better alternatives.  While Vivino has ambience and might be a great place for a work dinner, the food was utterly bland. I am not a salt fiend - in fact my husband is on a salt-conscious diet, but both the Tuscan  bean dip amuse bouche and the artichoke ricotta pizza were virtually devoid of salt. The bread was unexceptional - they could have bought it locally for all the character it had.  While the crust of my pizza was crispy and the hint of lemon worked with the arugula and artichokes, I feel like I would have had better value ordering a delivery pizza. The concierge recommended Mama Ricotta's - next time I think I'll listen."}
{"text":"This is my third time and I've yet to be blown away. I'm a vegetarian, and there aren't a ton of options, so maybe the limited menu is my problem.   The cheese plate is nice, with 4 varieties I've never tried before, and all were delicious. The soft creamy cheese and the orange blue cheese were my favorites. Sorry, forgot the names.   The bruschetta is interesting, but not typical at all. The bread is good, and it's layered with honey, apple slices and arugula. It all worked, just wasn't what I was expecting.   From then on, the meal devolved a bit. Two in our party had the scallops, which they thought were good but overpriced for the portion ($28 for 3 scallops). The sauce under the scallops is delicious, maybe some sort of lemon butter. Also the brussels sprouts served with the scallops made me rethink my aversion to them.   There are only 2 vegetarian entrees:  mushroom risotto and pizza. Since I'm not a fan of mushrooms, I've gotten the pizza each time I've been here. I don't ever remember it being as bad as this time though. It's supposed to be thin and crispy. Mine was soggy. Too much cheese (4x too much) and not enough bake time created a soggy mess.  I knew right away it couldn't be great due to the insane amount of cheese piled on, but I asked for it to go back in the oven to try to get the crust a little more done. It came back out looking the same as it did before, although this time it was slightly warmed up. On the plus side, it was removed from my bill without me saying anything, which showed good attention and service.   Desserts: I should've taken the waiter's advice. I waivered between the peach cheesecake and the chocolate pastry but ended up getting both. He warned me that the cheesecake wasn't that great and he was right. I couldn't take more than one bite. It was grainy, not sweet, mushy and flavorless.   The chocolate pastry, however, was nice. Thick crunchy pastry double wrapped around a small amount of dark chocolate filling, topped with peanut butter gelato. Too much for one person, this dessert is perfect for sharing. All 5 of us had 2 or 3 bites each, which was a perfect ending to the meal."}
{"text":"Nicely prepared food, at reasonable prices, in a warm, welcoming atmosphere.  Olive app was perfect (I've had similar that were served too warm and the olives becomes mushy); gnocchi were excellent and bordered outstanding; and veal was very good (I would remove the ravioli base and replace with a seasonal green).  Worth the visit and definitely will return to try some other offerings."}
{"text":"Excellent Salmon entree and bibb salad!  The bibb salad had pecans, strawberries and crispy lettuce. Good combo of flavors! We had wonderful service and a delicious dinner. The salmon was prepared excellently and came with eggplant and vegetables. The vegetables were like a ratatouille style, tender and crunchy. They had homemade bread which was yummy! The Pinot Grigio wine was fantastic!   I used the complimentary valet so parking was easy. The waiters were awesome! We sat inside but the patio looked great!"}
{"text":"I had a great time here last year and coming back had high expectations. Maybe that's dangerous.  They weren't ready for our 7:45 reservation. I remember this being an issue last year as well. I don't mind having a drink at the bar but I was already pretty hungry. Around 8 the hostess says she has a table for us, but it turns out she was bluffing. Another 5-10 minutes passed before they found us one for real.  I had never seen their upstairs seating before. The view has potential, but that is where the good news ends. The noise was overwhelming. We couldn't hear the waitress, she couldn't hear us, and conversation was impossible. It was dark too, but at least the darkness wasn't painful. I'd like to evaluate the service and the food, but our poor waitress was handicapped by the noise and the lights were so dim that I never really saw my food. I expect both would have been fine under better circumstances."}
{"text":"When you want great Italian in the Uptown area, Vivace is the place to be! Located in Midtown in the new, chic Metropolitan area, Vivace has never disappointed. From the good looking people, to the professional & knowledgeable staff, you will feel the energetic vibe upon entering Vivace no matter what day of the week, but especially on Friday & Saturday.   My favorite meal is the veal saltimbocca with mussels as a starter. Not your traditional saltimbocca as it's more of a Marsala sauce base, but the key ingredients of saltibmocca are there. I always consider and get most of the time the cheese & meat tray. Decide or don't decide for yourself; the staff will surprise you with some great choices that meld well together with some great jams.   Great bar area to mingle with friends or coworkers in the downstairs, and try to take advantage of the patio area that sits along the green-way. My ideal evening is one where I take advantage of the great upstairs area of the restaurant. Sit at the bar upstairs and have some drinks/wine and their famous flatbread (pizza), and finish the night off in the lounge area, sitting outside, enjoying one of the best views in all of Uptown Charlotte.   This is definitely a once/month visit for me. You've gotta check it out!"}
{"text":"We finally visited Vivace for the first time this past Saturday night.  As expected, it was beautiful inside the restaurant.  As unexpected, while it isn't supercasual, it's not superdressy or stuffy either.  It was \"just right.\"  Classy, but casual.  We were seated in a corner booth/table.  The lighting/atmosphere of the restaurant is very pleasant, and the decor is very modern.  To start, we ordered a couple of random Italian wines neither of us had heard of before.  And, yes, I probably pronounced it wrong.  To start, we ordered the calamari fritti and bruschetta with goat cheese, tomato, and broccoli rabe.  The portion of the calamari was very generous.  And while spicy tomato aioli dipping sauce and grilled peppers sprinkled in between the calamari pieces gave the dish a great flavor, the calamari itself didn't have much flavor.  I think the coating needed some spices/flavoring added to it to really perk it up.  The three pieces of bruschetta were delicious, but I didn't taste much of the goat cheese.  I think it could have used more, especially for the price.    Because the portion was so big and we had other food still on its way, we only finished about 2/3 of the calamari.  Our server came by to take it away and we were surprised that he didn't offer to box it up for us, so I spoke up and asked for a to-go box for it.  BTW, we never did see the rest of the calamari again.  Whomp whomp.  I guess it was just as well.  Calamari doesn't necessary reheat very well.  It just seemed odd that our server would just take it away, though, and not ask if we'd like the rest of it wrapped up.  We did pay for it after all.  And the table next to us had two big bags of leftover food that they were taking home.   Next came soup and salad.  My partner ordered their soup of the day, which was a black eyed pea soup, and I ordered the caprese salad.  I'm not a big fan of black eyed peas, but the creamy soup had a good flavor to it.  My salad was fantastic, though.  Different than normal caprese salads consisting of tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, basil, and balsamic vinegar, this one had roasted tomatoes, mozzarella, pesto, and balsamic vinegar.  The roasting of the tomatoes (that were served cold) really made a huge difference and gave the dish extra flavor.      We ordered so many pre-meal dishes because we noticed that Vivace offers smaller portions of some of their entree dishes.  That's great for diners who would like to sample a variety of their items, like we did.  So for our mini entrees, my partner tried the Butternut Squash Tortellini and I tried the Scallop Risotto.  The risotto was actually a pumpkin risotto with two good-sized grilled scallops on top.  Both had a delicious flavor to them.  Again, it was \"just enough\" because we had already had several appetizers/tapas.  This was like just one more.    I'd like to come back during the warmer months and try their fabulous patio seating, but I'll make sure not to order too much food that I can't take to-go."}
{"text":"OK, I'll admit it, I am just not that fancy.  I went to Gay Bingo with some friends (which is alaways a fun time!) and they wanted to come here afterwards.  I personally found it overpriced and not worth it.  We sat in the bar area and the bartenders (there were 2 and we were the only people in the bar area) seemed annoyed they had to serve us.  Then we ordered appitizers, which were pricey and good, but not great.  (The mussels were really good though!)    Overall, it could be a great place and I would be willing to try it for dinner, but I was not overly impressed by my \"night at the bar\"...or the really big check we got!  I could have a few drinks with friends for 1/2 the price at many other places!"}
{"text":"As a native New Yorker with Italian roots, I am usually pretty stingy when it comes to reviewing Italian restaurants. I went to Vivace for the first time about two weeks ago, and I have to say... This place was outstanding. The food was delicious, the atmosphere was upscale without being pretentious, and the service was excellent. Plus they had playoff hockey on the TV's in the bar. Overall, it was a wonderful experience, and I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a unique place with a patio for lunch. Happy to have found Vivace. Professional service, beautiful restaurant and patio, and excellent food."}
{"text":"Vivace is the first place I've found in Charlotte with a truly \"All you can drink\" bottomless brunch. Coming from DC where that's pretty much every brunch, that's been sorely missed in my life.  Enter Vivace. This place does the bottomless right. I think the deal they have is an individual appetizer, entree, and bottomless mimosas or bloody's for like 30 or $35. Super good deal - especially if you're there to drink.  Vivace looks like a super fancy place when you walk in - and it may very well be - but we were not looking to get too fancy when we went, just to enjoy a nice birthday brunch with some friends.   The menu items on the bottomless deal had a good variety, and after trying a little bit of everyone's I can say there doesn't seem to be a bad bite on the brunch menu. I had the calamari with dipping sauce to start and then the carbonara pasta.  The calamari was served hot and crunchy so that was delicious. The carbonara was solid and what you would expect from an Italian restaurant. I did have to stop drinking my mimosa for a few minutes to fully enjoy my carbonara because of the conflicting tastes, but thats probably on me for ordering a pasta dish and drinking OJ! The fact that they mimosa pours were HUGE allowed me to not get that far behind the group.  If you're looking to feel a little fancy but still get a good bit of booze'ing done with your friends, Vivace could be a really nice option for you. I'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I want so badly to like this place!! They really need to figure stuff out still. I have been twice and there really is no consistency going on here.  First time i went this place was packed on a Wednesday night! The decor is very nice and so vibrant! The chairs are super comfy which is a plus! Service was good.  First trip had the Proscuitto with figs and bleu cheese...good not spectacular. Then had the Taglitelle Pasta it was good I love cauliflower only wished there was more of that in it but it was good.   Second trip had the Sweet Potato gnocchi with pork belly and cipolini onions.....SO DRY!! Hated every bite of it not even a hint of sweet potato!! I also ordered the Beef Carpaccio I really wish I had taken a picture of this dish because unless you were my sister or my boyfriend sitting at the table with me when this was put down would you even begin to understand how horrendous and Unappetizing this dish looked and tasted! It had what was suppose to be Grilled Radicchio completely covering the whole dish mounded on top of my poor Beef!! It was flavorless NOT grilled and just wrong! OK then we each ordered a pizza I had the salty egg it was good the tomato sauce on it was good! My sister had the Four cheese but only wished she had some tomato sauce on it. Then my boyfriend had the chicken an artichoke pizza and he really liked it...until he bit into his second piece and bit down onto a chicken bone/cartilage...Needless to say he didnt finish it and we sent it back.   The server was apologetic and asked if she could get him anything else, he had lost his appetite though. Then the most awkward manager Ever approaches our table and just stands there for a few seconds and then says \"How about that pizza, Sorry\"  then walks away!! We just looked at one another and laughed!! Where did they find him cause that was the worst customer service EVER!!!   Vivace just needs to do some training starting with their Management (obviously) and then in the kitchen. The things we experienced in our dining experience could have all been prevented if they only took the time to care more about the quality of food that they are putting out!! Sorry!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible inside. It a very romantic setting with dim lights & a red hue. It's definitely a classy place. I started with a fruity mixed drink & didn't love it.  The bread that came out was fantastic, soft & flavored with rosemary, very nice. I ordered the smoked chicken agnolotti & I really enjoyed it. The flavor was great, the only problem was the portion size was pretty small considering how much it cost. That wa my only complaint. I planned on ordering the maple cheesecake but didn't so I will be coming back just for dessert next time."}
{"text":"I have been here once for lunch, and once for dinner.  I highly recommend Vivace for lunch. Our group really loved the salmon lunch, and their little pizzas. The bread was enjoyable and the prices were very reasonable. 5/5  The restaurant is bright, airy and modern. I loved the wood paneling and giant oversized orange glass lighting. I really appreciate the beautiful upfit and the bar area overlooking the skyline. The only thing I'd add is tall ceilings often makes the place feel really impersonal.  The highlight of our dining experience was 1) our server who was like an actor in one of Shakespeare's dramas and was so enthusiastic about the food, he upsold us on the dessert. Well thank goodness- the tiramisu saved the whole meal. It had the distinct taste of orange, which I loved. It was light and lovely. (5/5) He also recommended an Italian wine DH loved.  My husband enjoyed the veal with mozzarella ravioli (a lot more than I did) 4/5. The salmon over cauliflower puree left a lot to be desired (2/5). The salmon was fine. It was cooked to the correct temperature. The puree was way more creamy than cauliflowery and I got the sense it was not a healthy alternative to potatoes. It was so creamy it lacked substance which left it flat and me still hungry. Brussel sprouts were below average.  Bottom line: Great spot for lunch or happy hour drinks. I can't wait for the weather to improve to enjoy drinks and tiramisu on the patio!"}
{"text":"Still coming here and still my favorite brunch place. Hillary is still the best waitress/bartender but BRING BACK THE SHORT RIB :) kthanksbye"}
{"text":"Great location. Great atmosphere.  Disappointing food.  We had the steamed mussels as our appetizer.  It was just ok; there were at least six mussels that weren't opened and we didn't chance eating them.   My risotto was so overcooked ... Duck, order medium, served very rare.  Wife's pan roasted grouper had so much olive oil you couldn't taste anything else.    For desert we ordered the Espresso Cheesecake with Hazelnuts and they forgot to put the hazelnuts on (and the small cupcake sized cheesecake served on huge plate was a joke).  I would not return or recomend Vivace."}
{"text":"Had a light dinner. Caesar salad which was average at best and the chef's choice cheese and meat plate which was unreal. Definitely going back. The Montepluciano wine was a great pairing."}
{"text":"Awesome place for brunch!   I tried there brunch for the first time over the weekend and really enjoyed everything.   My favorite part your brunch price includes endless....let me say it twice because it sounds so nice...endless mimosas. And they are delicious!   For brunch you chose an appetizer and entree from a pretty large selection.  For my meal I ordered the calamari and the chicken panini. Both dishes were very tasty! Even better both came out from the kitchen hot. I'd absolutely order them again.    Oh and the portions here are pretty large so expect to leave stuffed and have a to-go box! If the brunch is this good...I'm looking forward to trying their dinner menu next time!"}
{"text":"We just went to vivace for the first time. Although we were not blown away, we were ultimately satisfied with our meals. The location itself is very easy to get to with plenty of parking and  free valet. The decor is very nice. The dining room is open with a trendy atmosphere. They definitely spent some money with the decor between the lighting, the grand staircase and the wine vault.   One thing we enjoyed was they substitute butter or olive oil with a house made bean spread with their bread. We thought it was a great change. We started with the gnocchi with spinach and pancetta appetizer. I have to say it was a true appetizer because it made us look forward to our meal. It tasted fresh and had great flavor. The only downfall is it blew away both of our entrees. I had the veal saltimbocca with cheese ravioli. The veal was nicely cooked but the sauce lacked any flavor other than mushrooms. The ravioli was house made and was perfectly cooked. However with the somewhat bland sauce and only being cheese filled it did not really add to the flavor of the dish. My wife got the pappardelle bolognese. The pappardelle was house made however it was very overcooked and a bit mooshy. The appetizer would definitely get five stars and the two meals between two and three stars. Eventually I would like to go back and try a few other dishes. I give big points though to the fresh and homemade ingredients though.  We are looking forward to going back soon. Look for a second review!"}
{"text":"Bomb pizza!!! Had the BBQ chicken pizza during CIAA event and even with all the crowd they still mastered the great taste!!! Winner here!! And first timer!! Will be back - I can only imagine how much better it will be during regular days."}
{"text":"Stopped for a quick bite Friday night without a reservation.  Was told we could  sit in the bar and get 'full service'.  Our waiter was knowledgeable with menu and wine.  We ordered wine and wine came out quickly.  Shortly thereafter he brought bread and a yummy spread.  We managed to get a bite of bread before our salad arrived.  We enjoyed our salad for 5 minutes and out came our dinner!  Waiter asked if I was finished with my salad.  With plenty of salad in the bowl, I said no.  Sadly the entree, pasta with crab meat was barely warm.  The ambiance was very inviting, unfortunately, I will remember that there was more emphasis on turning the table than servicing my party."}
{"text":"I visited Vivace as it was on my list of the restaurants left in Charlotte that I had not yet experienced. ( http://ApeSmith.com ) I went with a good friend and we stayed for a couple hours at least. I will give full disclosure and say that I knew our server, Jeff beforehand, but did not know that he would be waiting on us so that was a nice surprise!  We started out with wine, which was suggested by Jeff off of a nice, simple wine menu and then moved on to cheese and charcuterie offered from the appetizer menu. I chose 3 of each for my friend and I and these servings were HUGE! We couldn't finish all of the meats/cheese and were almost full before the entrees were even ordered. Bonus: the appetizer was only $12 which was a steal! Jeff was nice enough to help us choose which ones we would like best too. Thanks Jeff!  We ordered traditional pastas for dinner and barely put a dent in them because we were so full. The pastas were decent but nothing extraordinary. We obviously did not get to the dessert but stayed for a little while longer to chat and finish our wine.  I would say that the best part of this place is being able to sit on the patio when the weather is nice and enjoy the sunset and a spectacular view of the Charlotte skyline. It makes for a very romantic evening. The atmosphere inside is upscale, yet hip and modern. The staff is professional and friendly and it seems to be a place to go after work for drinks or a great date spot. If you sit inside the restaurant, afterwards have a glass of wine upstairs on the patio to take advantage of the view as well as the loungey couches.   I would go again very soon to try some more Italian yum yums!"}
{"text":"Great vibe. Hip place with great food in midtown. Miss the zucchini tempura - was their best app. Good Italian flare but not over the top with some dishes if you have members of your party looking for something more neutral. The bar is a nice happy hour spot for young professionals. Great patio overlooking the city (and unfortunately a couple of Charlotte's ugliest hotels)."}
{"text":"Well, I must admit, I didn't get overwhelmingly impressed by Vivace.  The location and atmosphere is very good and a great meet up spot.  The interior is a modern mix of some great elements though the overall scheme is a bit confusing.  That being said, the food was okay...nothing spectactular and I could attribute it to our menu choices, but I'm not sure I will.  A fellow yelper and I chose two different pizzas and they were both good, though nothing only available at Vivace.  He ordered the chilled tomato and cucumber soup and it was pretty good and his favorite selection of this visit.  For dessert we sampled the Expresso Cheesecake which could have used some depth either with more flavor or the addition of a complement to the expresso ...either way it was lacking in full flavor.  We also had several flavors of gelato...cherry vanilla, mint chocolate chip and sweet corn...they were all okay - the mint was by far my favorite.  Our service was great!  She was attentive, offered suggestions, answered our questions and never let our glasses get empty...I almost gave a 4th star for that, but decided against it because the overall experience was just nothing super special.  If invited to return I would go and try something else, but I doubt I would seek out another meal here on my own.  Points for a cool place to meet up in a neat spot with friends or for a date - but an A-OK for my experience with the meal."}
{"text":"Took my wife here for dinner on valentines day and we loved it. Started at the bar and enjoyed the mojito Italiano and good conversation with the bartender. For dinner there was a valentines day menu which was delicious."}
{"text":"After hearing so many great things, I finally made it to Vivace!  Even with all the hype it did not disappoint! It is absolutely one of the best in Charlotte.  You'll find a great atmosphere and delicious menu. Perfect for a date night, group dinner, or drinks and appetizers at the upstairs bar after work overlooking the Charlotte skyline.  For dinner I enjoyed the scallop risotto--amazing!  And my friend was generous enough to let me taste the mussels--also incredible!  Trust me that you will clean your plate, but don't deny yourself dessert.  They are amazing!  We ordered several desserts for the table to get a taste of each and in my opinion the best were the gelatos.  They change their flavors but we had cinnamon, mint chocolate chip and nutella--so good!  I'd say Vivace is the best Italian in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Vivace is one of my favorite places in Charlotte to kick back and relax.  Happy hour offers wonderful appetizer specials for $5.  I have always had good service here.  Although it has a slightly upscale feel, I am comfortable whether I am coming straight from work or with blue jeans.  Highly recommend for dinner or drinks and apps."}
{"text":"Had a living social for $40, so I thought we'd check it out for brunch.  We got up sold on a $25 brunch menu that included endless mimosas and bloodies.  Tried to order a 4th drink at the end of the meal and the waiter tried to cut me off.  Really?  Then I couldn't use the living social because it was a \"special offer\".  Getting cut off from ENDLESS drinks and dropping $70 on lunch put me in a bad mood. Food was ok, but left with a bad taste in my mouth. Meh."}
{"text":"One of the best meals we have ever eaten out.  Muscles were great."}
{"text":"Really love this place. The house made cocktails are amazing. The mojito or strawberry mojito are just impossible to resist ordering, love 'em.  Have come for lunch with my family several times. Last time I wasn't that hungry, so I got the mussels appetizer & some bread thinking I would have a small lunch. They came and they totally blew me away, and solved my un-hunger problem in like 2 seconds. HUGE bowl of mussels in this crazy good garlic-chili sauce. I couldn't get enough of it, everyone who was there with me demanded some mussels and we tore through the bread on the table sopping up that sauce.   Every time I go, there is a dish like this on the table.  Just a win all around.   Also, very nice intimate atmosphere, had a lovely date here with great service last month. We sat there well into the evening and didn't even notice how late it was... the staff was very courteous all through the night."}
{"text":"I choose this place for a birthday brunch because of the bottomless mimosa's.. My crowd is large and rowdy so I asked for a private room- they graciously accommodated. Once everyone arrived, we were seated with one server handling a table of 14.  It was partly our fault because the room is designed for 12 and they squeezed in two more for us. Being a peak time for the restaurant, we sat for almost 40 minutes with no drinks.  Since we came for the bottomless mimosa's- that wasn't working for us. The manager stepped in and quickly made the situation better, and proceeded to probably overserve us!! We were so pleased that we progressed to the bar and then the lovely patio for the rest of the afternoon. I think this restaurant needs kuddos for exceptional service!! Everyone in the service industry gets backed up at one time or another - it's how you handle it that is the mark of excellence.  Vivace - you won us over, we will be back!!"}
{"text":"Never a bad time. The best salads and meatballs. Great selection of wine. Been to a few private events upstairs. The staff is very professional and the food is amazing. Just be careful to sit on the other side of the doors in the winer :) The wind blows in and its breezy!!!"}
{"text":"I'm ok with Vivace. I'm not a huge \"pasta Italian\" fan. This place has the more upscale Italian fare with plenty of entrees that I can't even pronounce! :D  I initially ate here over a year ago & had a nice shrimp pasta dish, that they don't even carry on the menu anymore. I remembered liking it because it was a simple dish with a light sauce that wasn't the typical marinara type sauce.  Since that outing, I've been here a couple more times in the bar area. The drinks are delicious & refreshing & they have an extensive wine list.  The bartenders are always nice & are quick to give you recommendations.  I love the interior of the restaurant...fresh, modern, & upscale. Their patio seating is nice, as well.   Other notes: pricey!  They offer banquet menus, the restaurant is great for groups, they have a meatless options menu, valet parking, & lunch & brunch."}
{"text":"$5 Bar bites YES YES YES!  These really aren't just \"bites\" this is quite a deal that Vivace offers.  From 5 to 7 I think Mon. - Thurs. not really sure though - you can get a huge portion of mussels, calamari, pizza and more.  This place has one of the best outdoor seating areas in town and the service has always been great.  They have a nice wine selection but it's not cheap.  I asked about drink specials but they don't really do that here.  I give them 4 stars just for the $5 bar bites not only tasty but affordable."}
{"text":"Oh, Vivace. I had long wondered why I was never a huge fan of Italian cuisine. Too many experiences of overly-filled plates of pasta with heavy, sweet sauce I suppose. My negative streak was meant to be broken here! Vivace has tuned my palate to the finer side of Italian eating. These guys have a killer location in Metro and their space is coveted by many. Juxtaposition alone lands them a whopping high-five. Hello, greenway and view of Uptown. Little did I know before my visit.   We stumbled in on a lazy afternoon for a 3:30pm lunch. Perfect timing for a quiet meal on the patio. We had one of their over-sized umbrellas all to our selves with a glorious Uptown backdrop. We weren't even aiming for romantic but it comes standard on the patio. Huge fan.  Our server was very helpful and knowledgeable with the menu. Took into account the weather (rather hot) and recommended some refreshing appetizers and drinks. Greatly appreciated his recommendations.   I ordered a Limon Cello. Fresh lime juice, triple sec and soda water. Here's the breakdown on the \"Cellos.\" Not an instrument. Nay. In fact, there are several choices and all made from fresh fruits and juices in house. Quite impressive and the freshness doesn't lie.   Apps: Bruschetta. Holy wow. This is the best bruschetta I've had in the Queen City to date. Perfectly balanced with fresh bread, sweetness and fresh basil. The tomatoes are smoked in house. Yes, I said smoked. The flavor is incredible. Comes with six 1-2 bite pieces. Each should be savored and perhaps taken from your fellow diners if they aren't paying attention. I was tempted to lick the plate. Incredible flavors swirling on each crostini of joy.   Cheese Plate. Man. What a treasure trove. We chose all 6 cheeses to try. Served on a woodblock with bread, honey, an apricot marmalade and a cranberry chutney-ish jam. Each cheese had it's own interesting note. Spicy, sweet, fermented, strong, mild and so on. No combination was incorrect with the jams and honey. I'd get this again in a heartbeat.   Entree-ish: Prosciutto di Parma pizza. The dough was thin, chewy and served as a perfect catalyst for the rest of the flavors. Fig spread, Gorgonzola and arugula danced very lightly on my palate and complimented one another nicely. This pizza was great. The proscuitto was only on half since my wife is a vegetarian but it was great. Mild and salty like it should be.   Dessert: Pistachio gelato. Creamy and choc a boc filled with pistachio pieces. Served with a biscotti. I only wish there had been a few more pieces of biscotti since it worked so well with the gelato.   So glad to have tried Vivace finally. Looking forward to heading back in the near future for a further look into their pizzas and greater entree selection. Cheers! (or, Ciao!)"}
{"text":"I dined here for a girlfriend's birthday, and it was a pleasant experience. They bring out some bread after you're seated, but I've had better at Macaroni Grill and Maggiano's (at least their breads aren't cold). I ordered a glass of chardonnay and a half a plate of their black linguini, and I will say the sauce was AMAZING. Wish I had some bread leftover to soak it all up! I just wish the portion size was a tad bit bigger, especially at $12.  Ambience-wise, very chic, modern and romantic! Recommend this place for a nice candle-lit dinner. They have a porch with comfortable couches on the second floor with an amazing view of the Charlotte skyline! This place made me wish I had a significant other just so I could get the full experience! haha"}
{"text":"Food in general was well prepared and artfully presented.  Bonus for those with diet restrictions, various separate menus for gluten, vegetarian & pescatarian.  On the upside, the kitchen really puts out first rate preparations, but not sure about the balance on all dishes.  Lobster Arancini appetizer was woefully weak on lobster.  The Arancini were beautifully prepared, but would have preferred and the sauce was perfectly balanced, but the tiny crumb of lobster was too small to share across two halves of the Arancini when cut in half to eat.    Scallops had good carmelization on one side and the root veggies were perfectly cooked, however the guanciale was neither observed or tasted.  The Salmon was well prepared and a doneness was offered and executed per request.  Unfortunately, the creamed ?cauliflower? under the salmon was literally cold.  Service was ok.  Downside is that we were at a table that backed up to the entrance and we received a fairly cold draft every time the door opened.  A very simple modification to the front entry would eliminate this discomfort; about 3 tables are directly effected."}
{"text":"Be Aware- this is not REAL Italian... If you are from a city who has it own Little Italy... you could barely barely stand the taste.. it really doesn't taste good AT ALL... But the service and environment is not bad. So I give 2."}
{"text":"I hosted a private party here for my Mom's surprise 70th birthday. One word, MAGICAL. David, the manager was amazing and Him, our waiter along with 2 other incredible customer service waiters and bartenders were the best. I've been in the customer service industry self for 20+ years and there wasn't a thing I would change.   The private upstairs dining area accommodated all 75 of us perfectly.  Curtains were drawn, candles were lit and the ambiance was spectacular. We had almost 20 children and they even made a seperate table for them and fed them right away. From the cocktail hour with hors' d'oeuvres and drinks everything was perfect.  Thank you guys!!!"}
{"text":"The carne e formaggio with mustard, honey, and marmellata is fantastic! I hogged most of the tray and only let a few pieces of the meats and cheeses go because I'm a nice person. ;)  The veal was good, but not particularly memorable.  The interior of the restaurant is great, with cool lighting, two floors, and a bar area that is marked off by a partial wall.  Until I find another decent cheese plate in this city, Vivace is going to be my go-to for this Italian staple."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to check out the hype and get the low down on brunch at Vivace. Now having been twice (once in substitute of a traditional Easter dinner), we can say that we are hooked.   Again, keep in mind we have only done brunch here. That being said, make a reservation and get here early as reservations and food go quickly! I would recommend going all in and paying the $25 to get the brunch special which includes (2) choices from (2) different food categories, some kind of sweet cranberry bread, and bottomless mimosas or bloody marys. In a way it reminds me of the brunch Heist used to have back when they first opened. As for food suggestions, I don't think you can really go wrong. Both my wife and I tried several different dishes over our visits and enjoyed everything. I will say get the quiche if they still have it. This behemoth sits almost a foot off your plate and was an amazing blend of cheesy, crunchy, and rich. Highly recommend. Also the bottomless drinks don't hurt."}
{"text":"My co-worker is Italian and loves fresh authentic Italian food. Vivace didn't disappoint when taking her out to celebrate with a birthday lunch. We dined as a party of 6 and everyone loved there entrees. The 4 cheese ravioli was big hit as well as the whole leaf Caesar salad. The tricky part for me was that this was my first week on weight watchers and didn't want to use all of my points on lunch. Lucky this delicious arugula salad with grilled shrimp and scallops didn't rack up many points at all and offered some delicious flavors, didn't use much of the lemon vinaigrette as it was mostly oil. Ambiance was nice I could see this being a great date night spot or fun for bunch."}
{"text":"Overall, this is a great place.   I wouldn't say it's good for a romantic dinner though because it is very loud.   I'm definitely not a fan of hip, trendy places with no substance so I was wary, but the food and service delivered 100 percent.  The gnocchi appetizer was delicious.   The caesar salad was a bit cheese-heavy but still good.   I was feeling adventurous so I tried the Scallop Risotto with beets and spinach.  Amazing!   My boyfriend had the spaghetti and meatballs and though the pasta seemed a bit thick to be a spaghetti, it was all really good.     If you still have room, get some dessert.   They make their own liquors there - I tried the orangecello to go with the chocolate molten cake, but they also have lime, lemon and seasonal strawberry.   Strong but good.    The cake was everything I wanted it to be.   Yum!  As for our service, we sat upstairs and were not wanting for more water, drinks, food, etc.   He was really on top of his game and made the experience that much better."}
{"text":"Valet parking nice, good food too but when your chandelier is a major focal point of the entire restaurant it's imperative it isn't a huge dusty eye sore... Yuck! What else isn't being cleaned? The manager laughed and said he cleans it once a month, maybe it's time to revisit that routine."}
{"text":"Good patio with nice views of the greenway. Good cheese and charcuterie choices. Nice cocktails and good wine choices.  I had the mussels - YUM and the charcuterie and cheese plate with way too many meats - but it was delish!    If you are avoiding carbs, like me - this is the perfect meal to have at an italian place - just don't use the bread provided with either item and you are good. No pasta, no flatbread, no problem. :)  The salads looked good as did the flatbread though - if you are into that. :)  Take a walk on the greenway, then stop in here for a bite. It is casual enough to feel comfortable in street clothes and later at night, you could be more dressy here."}
{"text":"Recently went here for date night. Loved the atmosphere and loved the decor on the inside. Very modern and upscale feeling. I also liked that we had a nice view of the city while eating dinner. The food was very good. We are from NJ and I have had a hard time finding really good Italian food, but this was very close!"}
{"text":"We used to love Vivace but with this last experience we probably won't be back for a long while. They changed their menu a couple of weeks ago and it's rather lack luster. They retired some of the absolute favorites (like the bolognese pappardelle) in favor of some new twists and honestly, they just weren't as good - everything was just okay (some cases like the Caesar were less than okay). It's a shame because this place has great views, service is always good and we've usually enjoyed ourselves. But for the money you'll spend, there are definitely better food options available."}
{"text":"Below is my first rating for Vivace, which  was (if you read it) a not so great one.  After posting that review on Yelp, I was contacted by their GM and they said they were very appreciative of my suggestions, got rid of some of the awkward seating that I mentioned, and wanted suggestions as to some Vegan options that could be added to the menu and asked if my friend BJ S (a fellow yelper) and I would give it a second try.    Last night we went back and the chef prepared some incredible dishes for my Vegan friend - a caramelized butternut squash appetizer followed by an amazingly presented (and apparently very tasty - see BJ S's review) main course for him.  I had a chicken/pasta dish, that same appetizer, some wine, and a vegan friendly apple/dough/raspberry drizzle dessert.    The seats that we mentioned in our first review were removed and the food was really incredible.  It really means a lot to me that a restaurant cares so much about it's service/food/seating that they read the yelp reviews and really take the suggestions by us very seriously.  Kudos and now 5 stars to them!  Definitely check it out if you are nearby!  Previous review:  Barely a 2.5 star rating for me.  The seating was terrible - there were two of us, with a reservation, and when we were seated, we were at a very tiny table, in between two other tables, with the back side of all 3 tables sharing one bench.  It wasn't private in the least!! The woman at the neighboring table had her purse next to me the entire night, it was so close to me people probably thought it was my purse!  Our eggplant appetizer was quite good, but my main meal was just ok - not a whole lot of food for the price either.  My friend ordered a pizza and it was really bland (I had a piece of it, since I was still hungry after my meal).  Our waiter was friendly and quite attentive with the drink and bread refills, so that was about one of the only pluses of the evening.  I don't think I'll be back anytime soon!"}
{"text":"Great brunch spot. Complimentary valet parking. \"The Vivace way\" was perfect; bottomless mimosas + an app & entree for $30.  Just make sure to get a reservation first!"}
{"text":"Try the pork shoulder. It was delicious. I must say I was surprised by this place the food was fresh and flavorful.  I was concerned with the service at first but after we placed our order the service was fine. The manager even came by a few times to clean our table and bring us dessert menus.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I am a food snob. However-will come back over to sample terrific seafood Italian style delectables. Fab wine list. Beautiful space.  Date night!"}
{"text":"Had dinner at the bar on Saturday night and was overly was the attention and amazing staff at Vivace! Josh, the manager stopped by to check on us and Blythe made sure we we were very well taken care of!!! Highly recommend this big city feeling restaurant in Charlotte!!"}
{"text":"I don't know why but Italian restaurants have never been on my go-to list when it comes to dining out. I think it was the result of dining at too many Italian restaurants that hardly impressed - heck, I could cook Italian better than that.  BUT I'm a big fan of Vivace. It's Italian cuisine on a whole different level: refined and delicious! I've been to Vivace a couple of times before and I liked it - but we're rarely near Midtown so we hardly make it in. Big mistake. We need to make into Vivace on a regular basis!  We arrived on Friday evening after work and were seated in a booth with a great view of their open kitchen. I love seeing all the action in the kitchen.   The chef was nice enough to send out an amuse bouche of a perfectly seared scallop with olive oil.  It was a perfect bite.   After looking over the menu - everything sounded so awesome - my husband and I decided to start with the fried calamari. It was crispy and tender at the same time.  Perfect calamari.  For my dinner, I ordered the primi of the pappardelle bolongnese with goat cheese crema and a big bowl of mussels!  My husband ordered the larger size of the risotto with crab and corn. When my pappardelle came out, our server brought out another dish of their special homemade pasta with squash, squash blossoms, and sea urchin butter for my husband because the chef didn't want him to be without a plate. Super classy chef! Now, when I heard sea urchin, I perked up, my hubby, on the other hand, looked terrified. But he ate all of it and is no longer a sea urchin virgin!  I also cleaned my plate of pappardelle :)  At this point we were getting full and wondered how we were going to get through our entrees. But when our entrees arrived, feelings of fullness were pushed aside and we dug in.  My mussels were perfect (I know, I say perfect a lot) but they were. A savory broth with the sweet tender, mussel meat. My hubby's risotto was perfect (again!) - I snagged a bite and declared that I was going to order the risotto next time.   You're probably thinking we passed on dessert but when we heard that they were rolling out their new dessert menu we had to try something! Something turned out to be 4 desserts: Cinnamon sugar focaccia with honey, marscarpone cheesecake with a homemade graham cracker crust, chocolate bomba with ice cream and a cherry inside, and espresso ice cream with cherries. OMG - I loved every one of these desserts. The focaccia was light and airy, the cheesecake had a wonderful texture, the bomba was decadent, and the ice cream was was rich and creamy.  Needless to say, we were stuffed. Our server was great, she was super attentive and very knowledgeable of the menu. The restaurant is beautiful and I love the modern decor. Vivace changed my thinking when it came to restaurants serving Italian cuisine. They've done it so right that they have ruined me for any other Italian restaurant. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"went to vivace for a work-social meeting/team dinner.  just going to throw this out there right away...if you are a picky eater like myself-THIS IS NOT THE PLACE FOR YOU :)  i am very picky so i had a hard time finding something i would eat.  the hostess wasn't very friendly and probably not the best person to be greeting people at the door.  our waiter (wish i could remember his name) was awesome!  the service couldn't have been better.  he was extremely friendly, our drinks were always full and he took great care of us!!!  we sat upstairs which has a beautiful view of the city and could be a perfect place for a date.  as far as the food goes coming from a picky eater like myself the Gnocchi appetizer is amazing and the other 6 people from my table really enjoyed there meals.    So to sum it up, if you aren't picky...give this place a try.  Definitely get the gnocchi appetizer and bypass the hostess at the front door.  Upstairs setting is beautiful and hopefully you will luck up and the get male waiter who is very friendly and very attentive!"}
{"text":"Sunday's are for Vivace brunch! If you're 21 and over then you've got to do the Vivace Way! You get endless mimosas or Bloody Mary along with an appetizer and an entree! I had the mimosas, the mussels, and the salmon. My goodness it was sooooo delicious!  Our server, Heather, is amazing! If you get a chance, you need to request for her!! The ambiance is relax but classy. The food was bomb. Overall, my experience was very pleasant and I would love to visit Vivace weekly!"}
{"text":"Can you say scrumptious?  Man, this place is what's up!  I mean seriously!  It's something about Italian food that makes me weak....I just love it.....but this place is just on another level.  Everything is fresh and homemade pasta.......homemade pasta?  Who does that?  Certainly none of the Italian spots I've been to.  All I can say is I hope this place is around for a very long time because I am in food love!  I'll get to the food in a sec, but I was digging the plush dining upstairs and the incredible view of the qc.  They have tables and sofa's outside on both levels so I imagine it gets very lively in the summer.  They start you off with bread and a bean spread that my 4 year old loved(I swear the kid will eat anything:-) The brushetta had a shrimp salad topping instead of the normal tomato mix, and it had a bit of a pepper kick to it, but it was good.  The bolognese and the smoked chicken and spinach agnolotti was some of the best Italian food I ever eaten.....ever!  I mean change your facial expression with every bite good!  Let's keep this place in business......for my own selfish reasons:-)"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere. Noise level just right, meaning loud enough that you can't hear others conversations but you can hear each other! Our waiter was Caleb and he was fantastic. We were visiting with another couple and hadn't looked at the menu at all so Caleb, being such a gentleman and patient waiter that he is, said he would again give us more time and never rushed us. Finally we just gave up and asked Caleb to pick an appetizer for us. He described several and brought us a mushroom flatbread which was delicious. We also had bread and lobster bisque and a chicken dish with rosemary potatoes. All were delicious as were the drinks. Caleb was a perfect gentleman, a perfect waiter and very handsome too!!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place. There's not a bad thing on the menu. Been here twice for office parties, and both times have been very impressed. Good service, and good clientele.  The calamari and pizza are pretty damn good. Outdoor patio is secluded from greenway, and view is good of Uptown.  I'll definitely come back again. If you haven't checked this out, you should."}
{"text":"The first time I came here it was so great that I rated it 5 stars.  Since then this place keeps getting worse and worse, everything from the food to the service.. I tried to get in touch with the GM over my recent visit before I wrote this review, but have not received a response...."}
{"text":"My husband and I dined here a few weeks back while we were visiting for a work trip. We were referred here for dinner but ended up coming for brunch because I had to try the carbonara that was only on the brunch menu (I love pasta!). I initially ordered a Bloody Mary but was hesitant it may be too spicy (which it was for me) but the waiter quickly offered to switch my drink to a mimosa free of charge. The pasta for breakfast was delicious with the poached egg on top -- I even took my leftovers when we were leaving for the airport because I just couldn't let it go to waste. My husband had the strawberry parfait which he really enjoyed and the biscuit and gravy which he also really liked. Overall, cool vibe (we loved the wood panel decor), great service and great food."}
{"text":"After realizing that we were on a business trip on Valentine's Day, and finding a table for a nice dinner was virtually impossible, I finally came across Vivace. Now, don't get me wrong, they also were completely booked for Valentine's Day evening, however I was told the bar area that had high tops was a first-come-first-serve basis, so my mom, my boyfriend, and I decided to give it a shot.   When we arrived, we were seated immediately in the bar area at a nice and cozy high top. Our server came over and got our drink order, as well as explained their special 4-course Valentine's Day menu for the night. My boyfriend and I decided to go with the special menu, since we agreed to pick different items so we could try multiple dishes.   Course 1: Lamb Chops & Scallops Course 2: Beet Ravioli & Lobster Bisque Course 3: Roasted Chicken with Mashed Potatoes and Pesto Sauce                 Grilled Salmon with Risotto and Pomegranate  Course 4: Hazelnut Chocolate Mousse & Tiramisu  I was extremely happy, as was my tummy after this delicious meal! The food just exploded with flavor, and each bite was a party in your mouth. So glad I found Vivace and was able to experience such an amazing Valentine's Day dinner on such short notice."}
{"text":"The kitchen is very creative and delicious. Decoration is decent but they need more pro wait stuff that's for sure. I didn't get chance to try the deserts cuz I was very full after 3 courses but they looked yummy."}
{"text":"I love this place! Where else can you get crawfish pasta. With actual crawfish inside! Love love love! When your in the city and need a quick bite definitely check this place out. It has great atmosphere and great service! The idea behind it is amazing! No need to deal with waiters at all. You watch them make your food exactly the way you want and you sit down and eat it. When your done you pay at the front using these amazing little cards they hand you and it's done. Quick and simple!"}
{"text":"Wow. Literally the worst pizza I've ever tasted. I got the margherita, and the crust was like thick cardboard. I had to spit it out, and I completely lost my appetite after eating it.  I guess for an Italian place, they don't do pizza, but do do pasta well. I also got the butternut gnocchi which turned out good. The meat was very tender. However, the pizza really ruined things.  Second time coming here too. Ambiance and decorations are nice. Big, open place; there's even an upstairs lounge and outdoor patio. Lots of wines to choose from. However, the food's not particularly memorable which is often the case for Italian restaurants and well, the pizza was  horrible..."}
{"text":"I give this place 2 thumbs up for a brunch spot. Charlotte is always asking for good brunch places and I would definitely recommend it. I was here this past weekend twice because it was so good to me. They have a good deal that includes endless mimosa or bloody Mary's, an appetizer, and entree for $30. I feel like you can't beat it. I ordered the mussels for my app and mushroom frittata( similar to an omelette). I feel like it was very fulfilling and they did a good job on keeping the mimosas flowing. I will always recommend this place."}
{"text":"It was my first time eating here. It was pretty decent for the social atmosphere.  Kinda loud in there. Wouldn't do romantic date there. Wasn't fond of the water in glass bottles bc the one at our table burst. Water was every where.  The food was tasty.  Very busy restaurant. Make sure over half your party is there bc they won't seat you until it is. Even if you have reservations. We waited for 30 min before they finally sat us."}
{"text":"Upon entering, my eyes scanned the restaurant. WOW! The interior is decorated with class and upscale taste. It is spacious, has perfect lighting, and displays a great balance of colors and textures. The upstairs area has its own bar, lounge, and patio with a fantastic view of Uptown!   The staff are very friendly, attentive, and help make your experience feel VIP. I appreciated the friendly greeting from as early as the valet to the hostess and then to the server.   We were invited here for a social gathering of wine and appetizers. The server was very helpful by describing each item. Delicious! The food, company, and atmosphere was a perfect combination for a lovely evening.   To top it off, the bathrooms are made for one, spacious, and clean. Not the best lighting for touching up your face, but it is consistent with the rest of the ambiance.   Great experience! Plan to take someone you want to impress or to pamper yourself. I will return and bring my favorite friends!"}
{"text":"All I ask for is courteous demeanor and attentive service. Unfortunately, I received neither. The food is outstanding but I can prepare outstanding food at home. When I go to a restaurant, I am there for the experience. The experience was not less than perfect, it was mediocre. As long as Vivace strives for mediocrity, then it has no problem. But something tells me that the owner aims for more than that. As parents of a small child, my wife and I only have an opportunity to go out on weekends. We were really looking forward to visiting this place. Unfortunately, all it takes is a crappy waiter named Everett to spoil the experience.  My advice: Have staff read Setting the Table by Danny Meyer. If they don't get it, let them go pursue careers in a field that appreciates sardonic huffing and puffing.  I wish I could write two bad reviews for this place but unfortunately I cannot do so. But, I will make sure to recommend this place to people that I really do not like. Save your money and go to Little Spoon just 5 minutes away. Their food is absolutely awesome and the service is so stellar it should be used as a benchmark for other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"All of these reviews will tell you that the food is delicious. I've had brunch and dinner and they're right. All of these reviews will tell you that the services is great. Again, they're right. What I want to highlight is how perfect this place is for an event. The upstairs is perfect for small parties around 25 people. It's great for something like an engagement party. I'm not getting married, though."}
{"text":"Is it 2012 or 1912.  I have been to Vivace several times based off of co-worker's raving reviews for this place.   My Government job has held staff quarterly meetings here based off of my great experiences as well at Vivace's and needless to say that will cease as of today.   I took a friend here and attempted to order a Panini I have eaten several times at this restaurant.  The waitress nastily informed me they do not carry a Panini of this sort.  I remained calm and professional and described the Panini to a T....b/c I know for a fact that I didn't make this up in my dreams.  The waitress therefore explains a Panini on the menu that is similar to what I am describing and ensures that is what i must be referring to it.  Silly me.....I order her suggestion knowing full well that is not what I have eaten several times at this place.    I am also a little disturbed that this waitress is basically calling me a liar regarding the meal i formerly ate vs checking with a manager.     Low and behold a sandwich of disaster is placed on table and once again I question waitress on  this sandwich.      Lol as waitress rudely semi slammed menu on table and gritted through teeth \"MISS WE DO NOT SELL FRIED CHICKEN IN THIS ESTABLISHMENT\". lol lol lol once I informed her panini was like a breaded/fried chicken parm sandwhich.  Did i ask for a pot of chitlins, pig feet  and collard greens???  Well  thankfully I requested a manager who stated that item was no longer on the Menu and apologized for the waitresses behavior.    Needless to say this will be the last time I visit this establishment and next time train your staff to check with upper management before getting nasty and rude with CUSTOMER'S and acting as if they rather be scooping dog poop than taking your order!!!      And sadly the lady manager acted as if she rather just replace my order than taking the time out to hear the nasty/rude treatment my friend and I were receiving since being served by this new waitress.    Learn your companies menu ( or former menu) before getting ready to stand your grand and argue a customer down  . Restaurant 101.....................SMH"}
{"text":"The best thing about Vivace was the stand up comic masquerading as a waiter.  He kept us in stitches the whole meal.  The food was plain & didn't have much flavor unless the gristle on my scallops that had me thinking I had broken a tooth.  The scallops were burned & the butternut squash risotto was the equivalent of rice that had been boiled way too long in too much water.  We were with a large party.  The place was completely dead with the exception of our party.  The wait staff was very attentive.  As noted, the waiter kept us laughing which was a welcome distraction from the food.  One of my colleagues had the 4 cheese ravioli.  Her comment was that we could have run to Trader Joe's across the street & gotten better.  Another colleague had the smoked chicken & spinach angiolitti which is supposedly a best seller.  This did not even hit the spot.  The veggie lasagna wasn't anything special.  With the exception of the waiter & the overall ambience, the most important part the food left us with dreams of Trader Joe's having an Italian station."}
{"text":"My friends and I went for brunch. They have a special where you get bottomless mimosas, an appetizer and an entre for $30. Great deal. The food was good. I had the brussel sprouts for my app and they were delicious. I chose the shrimp and grits as my entree but I definitely wouldn't get those again. Not much flavor and there was too much of the marinara sauce overpowering the whole dish. They had plenty of other options on their menu though. Will go back."}
{"text":"First time here....Definite HITS and MISSES.  The misses - I ordered the Veal Saltimbocca. Well the VEAL was a clear MISS! Not pounded out flat but served relatively thick. Since VEAL is the star of the dish, it failed.  The hits - The fresh ravioli that accompanied my Veal Saltimbocca was OUTSTANDING! Tasted freshly made, and the MUSHROOM sauce was TO DIE FOR!  The Dessert - Tasty. The Tiramisu was good, but not in the upper tier I've had here in Charlotte. Very good quality but it still lacked that \"je nes se quoi.\"  Service was good and my company was outstanding! I'd like to come back to try other things......so keep the book open on Vivace!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Vivace on a Friday night with two friends to celebrate recent events and we were really looking forward to a lovely evening together. This was our first time to Vivace, but we had heard great things and we were excited that the weather was perfect to sit outside on the patio! It wasn't too busy for a Friday night, though every restaurant around them seemed packed.  Unfortunately, our experience at Vivace was disappointing to say the least. Terrible and slow service were the main issues. We arrived first and sat at the bar to wait for our friends - we were there ~5-7min without being approached or even greeted by one of the two bartenders who seemed flustered. Our friends arrived and we decided to head straight to our table - which was dirty and needed to be cleaned. Our server came by and greeted us to say he'd be back in a minute... Service Disappointments:  1) Drinks - once at the table, we waited over 15min to get our first drink order 2) Appetizers - took ~20min for Calamari, Brussel Sprouts, and Bruschetta 3) Table Prep - when apps arrived, we had no plates or silverware for an additional 5ish min 4) Drinks Round 2 - second round of drinks also took ~15+min for 4 glasses of wine 5) Entrees - when dinner Finally arrived, (we'd already been there for 1:30) the server accidentally spilled our friends dinner all over her lap and shoes, then took ~5min to get her some soda and towels to clean herself up. They offered her dessert for the inconvenience.  6) Food Quality - After ALL that, the food was mediocre at best. Fig pizza was prob the best thing we got all night - and the cheapest.   While we all had a great time catching up, we didn't expect our time at Vivace to span almost three hours for dinner. Our experience was terrible - we will not be back."}
{"text":"Went here for restaurant week last week. I wanted to like the food but the menu for restaurant week had very few options. My salad was quite nice but my main entree - the braised beef ribs had a very irony taste....almost like it was tuna. I dunno it just tasted a bit odd. My hubby liked his chicken though so a tleast we weren't both disappointed with our entrees. Love the dessert though - we got the chocolate torte with vanilla ice cream. All in all it was an ok experience."}
{"text":"Nice higher end restaurant  the wait staff was attentive.   The brussel sprouts were very tasty, as was the calamari.   For and entrée I had the veal it was good but a small portion,  if we hadn't ordered appetizers I would have left the restaurant hungry."}
{"text":"I came here for Queen Feast and I enjoyed every dish. I highly recommend their Brussels. It was amazing. Such a variety textures in it. The main course was the veil and it was super tender and not at all gamey. Finished it off with raspberry purée cheesecake and it was lovely. However it was very soft and almost had more of a jello consistency. Server was excellent and had a lot of recommendations. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Let me set the scene, Date night,  we were the first table sat at 5pm.  I went by at 11am to pick out a table, drop the rose and give instructions for how I would like the table prepared.     EPIC FAIL!    We were sat at the wrong table, the rose was on a table I did not pick, the candle was not lit.   and we were sat against the windows where the sun was in our eyes so then we had to switch seats and place our backs to the windows.   Now a good start but lets move on..     Food was spectacular,   I highly recommend the truffle ravioli. (I almost licked the plate)   The server was extremely attentive and knowledgeable on the food.  I hate that I cant remember his name to give him credit.   ( upstairs july 27th shaved head )  Overall excellent experience except for the fact that I took the effort to come in and pick out a table away from the windows so the sunlight would not be in our eyes and that I gave fairly specific instructions as to how I wanted the rose on the table and candle lit as we sat.      Next time I will have the host repeat the instructions.   --side note-- it was restaurant week, and there were only 4 tables for me to choose from when I showed up at 11am,  I chose the best out of the 4 and a five pm seating time so we could make it to the theater at 730pm.   There were only 6 tables sat by the time we left at 645 700.    My point,  we should have had our pick of the litter for tables."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch and had salads.  They were fine but not worth the price tag, nothing special at all.  It was nice to sit outside overlooking the walking trail.  The service was fine."}
{"text":"This place used to be a favorite of mine until last night.  We walked in and immediately noticed food and dirt on the floors and most of the chairs were stained.  The candle on our table had no wax only a wick and was dirty inside.  Who puts this on a table? Even the aprons worn by the servers looked like they have not been cleaned.  The floor was sticky and looks like it is in need of a refinishing.  OK. That aside.  They were out of the scallops and oysters.  It was only 5:30 so what's the excuse??  Our server looked like she was about to fall asleep.  The pizza was just OK and the beet salad had very few actual beets and was drenched in dressing.  The guy who delivered the appetizers, the bruschetta I have to say was good, just put them on the table and didn't say a word. With all these great restaurants in Charlotte, especially right in that area, go elsewhere, save your money."}
{"text":"I have been here twice, once for dinner and once for brunch. Their portion sizes are really big and it is easy to share entrees. Their brunch special is 1 app + 1 entree and bottomless mimosas or bloody marys. It is an incredible deal especially in Charlotte were there aren't many bottomless brunch resturants. I love their margarita pizza and their bruchetta."}
{"text":"Food and the ambience was decent. We went there for lunch so the seating upstairs with uptown view was closed. We had a pleasant experience so we would love to try it the weekend dinner or their much raved brunches with the view. The service was quick."}
{"text":"Not the best or the worst Italian food I had. In fact, the cured meat platter was pretty nice. The entree and other sides were just average."}
{"text":"Went for brunch on Sunday for the first time and fell completely in love! From the atmosphere to the food and service, everything was outstanding! My boyfriend and I each got an appetizer, main course and endless mimosas and/or bloody Mary's and paid a total of like 53 bucks(not including a tip) but about $25 a person...what a steal! I definitely recommend this place to anyone! I wish I remembered our servers name because she truly provided such awesome service. She was extremely knowledgable, friendly and made sure we didn't stay thirsty by staying on top of our mimosa refills! I know I'll definitely be going back again soon!"}
{"text":"Everything was good,  but nothing was \"wow!\"  The chefs relied too much on salt to season the food.  We also waited a long time to have our orders taken and then the food came  at a very uneven pace.  I've eaten tapas many, many times before,  so I'm familiar with the fact that the dishes come out as they are ready,  but one of our dishes came out so long after all the others were finished, I  was certain they had completely forgotten it.  We had it put in a to go box once it was delivered, because by that time we were just ready to go."}
{"text":"Great place! Awesome wait staff. Our table had lots of different meals and everything was top notch. Come here."}
{"text":"We went to brunch here on a recommendation and loved everything. The food was delicious and the mimosas were perfect."}
{"text":"OK... WOW!  Webster's needs to invent a new word for how truly inventive and great this place is.    I was taken here on a very romantic date.  We had a lovely table on the 2nd floor looking out over the Charlotte Skyline.  My date had the tomato bisque for a first course and it was like velvet.  I had the Caprese Salad and just.. mmmmm!!!  For our entrees we decided to order two different half orders of the pasta dishes.  (Yeah, they do \"half orders\", can you believe it!?\"  We ordered the special which was braised beef with melted cherry tomatoes, and also the Crab pasta dish (see menu online) which came with pasta made with tomato sauce IN the pasta and a little red chille pepper... a white wine sauce, cherry tomatoes and arugula.  OMG... SO SO good!!!  Both dishes were perfect.  They also serve this super yummy \"white bean spread\" with their bread.  It is such a lovely alternative to butter or oil!  Very unique.    I agree with Chris M., nothing here is heavy at all.  The atmosphere is very trendy yet relaxed and in no way \"pretentious\".  Our waiter was very nice and well-versed with the menu to assist us in making our selections.  This was the first of what I hope will be many, many more visits to this fine establishment!"}
{"text":"Good food but spent $200 at bar and they then charge you for a club soda.  Really. Turns me off from coming back."}
{"text":"Vivace never lets down and most in part due to Blythe's impeccable service and incredible smile. Vivace is our first recommendation and place to visit on the weekends!  Josh always stops by to Check in to ensure we are being taken care of which is never in question."}
{"text":"Well I know a lot of people have been saying ooh I wonder if Vivace is still as good now that the head chef has left to make his own artisanal cheeses?  Answer, YES! For me, in some ways it is even better because it still holds true to the bold use of the real flavors of Italy, maintaining a focus on fresh local ingredients. You will never fin anything from a can here and you will find flavors from the north as well as the coast. True Italian specialties like gelato, pignolia tarts, dark cherry, black ink pasta, and now a beautiful salmon chop. That's a nice addition and for someone like me watching their cholesterol it was so nice to see a simple  capelinni with heirloom tomatoes and beautiful basil, with just a hint of chili. Thank you new head chef. Everything was always meet and cheese centric and I always felt weird asking for a vegan option and explaining about my health issues. I always loved the restaurant and now I can come more often."}
{"text":"Awesome brunch place-bottomless mimosas and bloody Mary's and great food! Outside seating is nice and has a great view. Outside seating is first come though."}
{"text":"We came here looking for nice casual dinner just after New Year's Day. The staff seemed to be short handed, however service was friendly and the food met our expectations."}
{"text":"I hate to do this but after my experience Sunday, Vivace has definitely dropped from 4 to 2 stars. I came with 2 friend for an early dinner Sunday and I had a Living Social voucher for $40 so figured why not.   Our server was really bad. Not sure if she was just painfully shy or just socially awkward, but either way she just wasn't good. The starters were pretty good, mussels and cheese plate. The accompaniments on the cheese plate though are not good. There was some fruit chutney or something that one of my friends likened to being already chewed and previously digested for us!! Then there was a honey which was okay and I can't recall the 3rd, though I tried a little and instantly regretted it.   For the entree I ordered the fish special, wild striped bass with shrimp, artichokes and mushrooms. There was no starch with the dish so I asked if it was possible to do a side of plain risotto, same as they serve with other dishes, and obviously I'd pay the up-charge. The server tried to offer me the appetizer portion of seafood risotto for $11. Uh no, I just want a small side, plus I already have seafood in my entree. Friends got salmon and osso bucco. Basically only the guy who got the salmon was happy. Me and my friend with the osso bucco were disappointed.   My fish was way too fishy and the osso bucco bite I tried tasted soapy!! I did end up with my plain risotto side and it was fine. I was left wanting more so I decided to try the salted caramel gelato. Meh, it wasn't bad but it wasn't great.   It makes me sad because I have really always been a fan of Vivace. I love the ambiance, the outdoor space is fantastic and more often then not the food is great. So I will not give up hope but I will prob wait a while before stopping back in."}
{"text":"Last night I had with 4 business colleagues a very disappointing meal at Vivace. The food came out cold and after complaining was reheated. It didn't taste well at all and I will never go back. This place is way overrated!"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere and the bar and the private area upstairs.  Great place to take a date!  The food is awesome but sometimes the service can be a little slow - but if you are not in a hurry, you will not notice it at all."}
{"text":"I have been to pretty much every brunch place in Charlotte and have never had more fun than I did at vivace!! The food is great and the staff makes you feel very welcome; of course Hillary took amazing care of us and our full mimosas! Definitely one of the best brunch spots in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I want to start by saying that we had a great experience and enjoyed the food tremendously. Our server was a bartender named Heather who took good care of us.  I do Uber part time and I'd heard about this place by picking people up from here frequently. I heard great things so I had finally decided to give it a try. Went with my wife for a late lunch. We got there too late for the brunch menu but were still able to try the great mimosas!  The place was packed, so service was a little slow to start. It was almost 15 minutes before we could order. The bartender also offered us bread to start us off, but it never arrived. I don't blame her since I'm sure this is not the fault of service. Not a huge deal.  My wife tries to keep gluten-free so we were thrilled to see they had gluten-free pasta options. I had the pumpkin tortelloni, she had the four-cheese ravioli. We also split the saffron risotto (excellent) and the rosemary potatoes (some of the best I've ever had - treat yourself and get a plate of these for the table).  We enjoyed our drinks and cleaned our plates in a nice, elegant environment. We also enjoyed that it is a fairly quick walk from the streetcar station, giving us a chance to browse around the city before and after our date.  I would absolutely recommend this place to someone looking for a casual atmosphere for a date night or for a business dinner. They had an extensive wine list and the dining room looked very comfortable. Additionally, when it's warmer out, I bet it would be a great place to sit outside as they have a great view of the Charlotte skyline.  Great job, Vivace - would easily go to five stars with a couple of tweaks."}
{"text":"Bugs  Last night 3 business associates and I dined here. food and service was fine but we had constant visits from unwelcome guests.....spiders to be exact.   One in the bread basket. We brought it to the attention of our server who told the manager. He came over to assure us he checked through the basket saw nothing. We assured him we did. He assured us he did not.  Later, my associate was swatting around his face like he was trying to swat a fly or bee. He said he could've sworn it was part of a spider web that fell into his face.  And later- after discussing the fact that we all were not crazy- we all looked up and there were multiple spiders inside the hanging light fixture. Clearly there was a nest up there. We called over the server who saw it immediately and called for the manager who looked and again claimed he saw nothing. We all were pointing. I shined my iPhone light on the spiders. He said he saw nothing! It was only after I started to get LOUD he- miraculously- saw the spiders.  His comment?: \"Well, that's nature\". Yes, that certainly is nature but I doubt people eating here want bugs falling from the light fixtures into their food. That, I can get on picnic.  Additional compensation? Free Meal? Anything offered by the Manager? No. Nothing. Nada.   So, eat here if you like bugs and a detached involvement from the management. I'm out and won't be back."}
{"text":"It is a good thing I was hungry!!!  First we had Bread and a White Bean Spread (\"complementary\" and needed to be)...  So What if free bread is below average - I never factor bread into my review rating unless I'm having a Sandwich (or Wrap), or I'm at a Bakery buying bread or if the bread is really good!  Though I expected better at Vivace I wasn't real surprised!    Next we had two Pizzas:  Basil and Tomato and a Chicken, Pepper and cured Pork and they brought us extra Basil when we asked!  These Pizzas cooked almost to perfection (close enough) and were very lite (super thin crust, almost perfect texture, little chewy and a little crunchy, a small yet perfectly proportioned amount of cheese and Not a blend or if it was it was very well executed (I hate most blended cheeses) No Sauce which is fine with me I like Pizza \"both\" ways).  Sounds good right???  How about the Taste?  These Pizzas were good, NOT very good, only a little better than average and since Vivace did almost everything right, I would not get them again!  Not because they were bad, only because I can not say they were any better than good, though better than many - Three yelp Stars.  That would make an easy review...Then I ordered \"Soup\"!  If this had been a Spanish Restaurant they would call this Tomato, Cucumber, Olive Oil, Garlic, Chilled \"Soup\" GAZPACHO!!!  It did have an Italian flare to it, beyond being topped with Marscopone Cheese (I do not like Marscapone and I LOVED this Soup).  If I would have dined here and only had this Soup - I would be giving this review 5 yelp stars!  Fantastic for Soup of any kind!!!   The service gets 5 yelp stars easily!!!!!!  From the Hostess finding us the last table (no reservations) Wednesday 7:15 it was packed!  Our server was fantastic and the service team was perfect!  Everyone did a great job!  Then as the \"Soup\" raised the \"stars\" the desserts SANK the ship!!! Doesn't Espresso Cheese Cake sound great?  It was as plain as mud ( no offense to mud ) easily the least tasteful Cheese Cake I've ever had!  Next we had Three \"Gelatos\" more like poor ice cream.  The flavors were:  Sweet corn, Cherry Vanilla and Mint Chocolate Chip, All below average and little flavor - not bad flavor just too little flavor.  While still at our table, we looked on line for another Restaurant to get Dessert after leaving here, I was so disappointed!   The Decor has Potential!  That is my way of saying they made some great decisions (Modern Clean (not Gaudy though I'm fine with Gaud...and the Wine chiller wall,cool) and uuuhhh well I'm not a Designer, though I guess I've been around some...  The Space has a great layout, yet it is not a Museum so unless it is Beautiful or Extremely Unique it does not add much to my dinning experience!  I love eating in a beautiful setting, though I would rather have great food in a \"hole in the wall\"  than have average food in a place that looks good, that still does not \"wow\" me.  The look of an eating establishment has little baring on my rating unless it is really Incredible or real dirty!    Always I want to give the highest yelp star(s) rating possible and say everything good about an experience, so I may return and get what I know is Great (which would only be Soup, so probably NOT) and the Service was Top Notch!!!"}
{"text":"Vivace is upscale and delicious food, but is not the best Italian around. We were impressed by the overall quality and flavors of the food, but there were a few missteps. The decor is great and the views from the patio and deck are wonderful. A great date spot."}
{"text":"Okay so this place was great. Our waitress wasn't from America and I couldn't hear her at all but that's honestly okay because she was so on top of our bottomless mimosas that before my eyes I had a fresh glass in front of me. But as I was writing this review she spilled a mimosa all over our friend Kevin Olsen but it's fine he deserved it don't worry about it. And unfortunately our table neighbors didn't appreciate it when we cheered that \"Olsen got wet\". They clearly don't appreciate anything they won't stop staring at us...but then again I guess they know how to appreciate a good looking group.The food was okay I got fat potatoes on the side of my sandwich and I wanted fries I mean I think those are the same things so whatever but it was a little disappointing. My friends were jerking off over the short rib hash it was only just fine tho they are dramatic. Overall 8/10 it's a good establishment, mimosas had pulp.....but we've dealt with worse. Had a good time here"}
{"text":"Just dined for restaurant week/ my fiancés birthday on a Saturday night. We were seated on the second level which was nice but seemed a bit less cozy than the first level with a view of the bar and a tv playing college basketball. We started with a bottle of Chardonnay and then both ordered from the restaurant week menu. I'll first say that the service was excellent, our waiter Sam was attentive even when he had a large party seated in the section, and answered all our questions while providing helpful recommendations. I started with the octopus, which was tender and perfectly cooked, served over fingerling potatoes with two sauces. This was a hearty and large appetizer. The pumpkin gnocchi for my entree was delicious, really complex flavors and lots of texture to complete pillowy gnocchi. The tiramisu was good but nothing unique. My fiancé had the caprese salad and veal saltambuca, he wasn't a huge fan of either but good tomatoes can't be expected in January. The veal and sauce was one note with a mostly salty flavor, the ravioli accompanying the dish were a bit thin and lacking in filling. Overall, we enjoyed our meal. Maybe I just ordered better but we are curious to come back and try brunch and the bar bites menu. This is a lovely place for a date night or Special event."}
{"text":"Overrated nothin special there are a lot of better restaurants you can go to for the same amount you'd spend here or less."}
{"text":"I have been to the Vivace many times in the past. It seems that the food quality has deteriorated somewhat since the last time I was there about a year ago. I think they do a good job with their pastas etc. On my last visit (June 2015) there I ordered the ribeye (medium rare) and it looked beautiful, perfectly glazed, and flash broiled at the very end for the sear. Unfortunately, I could barely cut the steak and once I was able cut a piece, the next challenge was chewing it. My client looked at me like I was trying to chew an entire pack of Starburst at once. I chewed through several pieces and threw in the towel. I will give them another chance, but will likely order something else."}
{"text":"Simply wonderful!  Excellent service! Amazing locally sourced food and everything...even the pasta...is made in house.  It was our anniversary and they made it a special one.    Don't forget to use the free valet parking.  They take care of you from arrival to departure.    Thank you everyone at at Vivace!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in Charlotte for the night and decided to celebrate our one year wedding anniversary at Vivace, and I cannot say enough good things about it. The service was exceptional - shout out to our server, Lauren, who took great care of us. She recommended an awesome bottle of prosecco and kept our glasses full the whole night. She was personable and the minute we told her we were celebrating an anniversary, she went out of her way to make sure we had a memorable evening. The food was just as good. We started with the charcuterie and cheese board (we particularly liked the Romano), and Caesar salads with a perfect amount of dressing. For the main course, my husband had the spaghetti and I ordered the parpardelle. Both dishes were fantastic, with clearly freshly-made pasta cooked al dente. I would definitely recommend their marinara sauce, which had just the right amounts of sweetness and spiciness. My husband even raved about the sauce, and he is a stickler about red sauces. At the end of the meal, Lauren offered us complimentary gelato in honor of our anniversary; we chose the Nutella flavor, and it was also spectacular. All in all, a great evening. So glad we took a chance on Vivace!"}
{"text":"I've been here so many times since it is a friend fav dinner spot and it's always been consistently very good.  I love the open floor plan, decor and super chic lighting.  The endless wall of wine is also adds to the \"wow factor.\"  Whether you are seated upstairs or down, you are bound to have good service and great food.  I've had something as simple as a pizza (which was delicious) to a few of their more expensive seafood dishes.  I've never been disappointed.    Parking can be very tight so I would recommend taking advantage of the complimentary valet service.  I would also recommend making a reservation if you are looking to get dinner on a Friday or Saturday evening.    If you are looking to grab some drinks on some comfy outdoor couches, head upstairs toward the bar and you can catch a great view!"}
{"text":"This cavernous restaurant just outside of downtown Charlotte is a pleasant and good place to have a meal with those whom you enjoy spending time.  Arrival:  I'm not sure if they still have valet parking, but it seemed like they didn't really need to have it - or have the guys parking the cars in white jackets (this place just isn't that elegant or regal).  Host staff was friendly and had our reservation information detailed accurately.  Plus.    Service:  Mixed.  I suppose this is the south and everyone is pleasant, but they do win points for being kind.  However, our server had limited wine knowledge and really couldn't offer suggestions or insight to those of us who were dining.  Food:  Good!  Not great, but solidly good.  The calamari fritti was a hit, and the caprese salad was acceptable.  The brick oven chicken was a big hit with our table, too, and the ribeye got a nod of approval.  Departure:  On a not-very-busy night during the week, it took a long time for the valet to retrieve our car (or they were short-staffed?).  Minor (and not really the restaurant's fault, technically), but worth noting."}
{"text":"I went to Vivace this afternoon for a small work event and had a mostly excellent experience. Our event was scheduled to be from 4-6, but the organizer didn't know that the dining room did not open until 5. Nonetheless, we arrived and deposited ourselves at the bar. I do not know the typical traffic at the Vivace bar from 4-5, but to say the service was poor would be an understatement. When I arrived (the second of three people), I was given a menu and nothing else. No greeting, no specials, no initial offer of a drink order opportunity. Eventually the bar tender came back around, took my order and served quickly, but the story was the same for the third of our party upon arriving.  Once our spontaneous cocktail hour was over we were seated in the main dining room. Our waitress came over quickly, explained that they had a new menu, and covered all of our questions. We started off with some delicious Brick Oven Oysters. A sparse portion for sure, but the orange mixed nicely with the lobster and spinach.  All three of us went with the New York Strip (medium rare) for our entrees. Absolutely perfect. The strip was actually pre-cut into about inch slices which saves you half the cutting time. Awesome flavor. The potatoes and broccolini were also amazing compliments to the steak.   The atmosphere was relaxed, although we were obviously there earlier than the typical crowd ( we were out before 7pm). After my first experience, I definitely would like to return and try the Roasted Salmon Filet at some point."}
{"text":"Get to the Chase:  Pros: 1) Fantastic eats! (Had the veal and pork meatballs, fresh linguine, grilled artichoke, and salmon) 2) Exceptional staff (Our waiter had the most polite and genuinely happy attitude)  3) Nice seating layout; We were lucky to have a long table outside with the city-scape when the sun was setting (perfect for our birthday buddy)   Cons: 1) None that I could think of"}
{"text":"Ordered from here for a business lunch and was asked if we would like anchovies on the salads...at our surprise you get a single anchovy. Industry standards is 5 for a garnish. If it's a garnish, it should be described as a garnish...not an add-on. Also too much arugula on the mushroom pizza...couldn't even see the mushrooms, we had to take a fill handful off the pizza just to get to the mushrooms.   After getting past all the arugula that's on everything (and i love arugula, but it was on almost everyone we ordered, just too much)  The food was good and norm it's a great place. Really good for a date night."}
{"text":"This place is so hip and cool. Love the vibe here and the food is excellent. When finding outside the view of Charlotte's skyline is amazing along with the walking trail right there. It's good to see people getting fit while your stuffing your face and drinking bottomless mimosas(talk about motivation). Vivace is always a go to spot for Sunday Brunch. Whatever day your having I promise going there will make it a little better."}
{"text":"Greast menu, selection and food were great for the price point.  Waitstaff could be a little more mature which would help in discussing preferences, especially wine options.  Like the interior overall, good space, table and atmosphere options.  We sat upstairs and it was nice, downstairs had some nice large table options too.  Only ambiance flaw is that it is so close to a major road which isn't very nice to look out on during an otherwise good dinner."}
{"text":"A beautiful space with beautiful plates. No detail goes to waste in this modern Italian eatery.  Classic Italian dishes with thought out, well portioned twist. Whether it be the use of seasonal vegetables for the salads, cauliflower with the bruschetta, the chili aioli with the grilled artichoke, the brilliantly spicy tomato broth for the PEI mussels, the fresh mozzarella ravioli pairing for the fork tender veal, the use of pureed roasted root vegetables layered with gnocchi for the hanger steak, (wait for it, almost there, we were party of 6, it seemed to be a slow Monday and there were only four other tables in there, plus bar action, no push to turn the table and I was enjoying every dish and the company)  the black and white tiramisu, the out of this world panna cotta w fresh berries, the generous serving of daily selected sorbet or the wide variety of wine and beer, you'll find something to fall in love with. Even if it's on someone else's plate. Will return for the rest of the menu and likely post it, when we return!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a post dinner desert / wine on the patio on a Sunday night. Fantastic mood on the patio for a warm fall night. Great peach crostada and gelato. In and out quickly but not rushed, great service and recommendation."}
{"text":"We hadn't visited Vivace in 4 years so we made a reservation during Restaurant week.  When it opened Vivace was a unique offering in Charlotte - delicately assembled pasta dishes, using local ingredients and artisanal practices (like hand rolled pasta). In a sense Vivace was a reaction to the Red Sauce Italian restaurant invasion that occurred about 10 years ago in CLT. I was most interested in finding how Vivace had evolved given the restaurant scene has certainly changed since it opened.  The short answer is it really hasn't, which isn't bad per se. The offerings continue to be very good, well made, and reasonable in size.   We started with a round of cocktails, all excellent - in particular their variation on a Moscow Mule with jalapeños. All the starters looked great, with the Brussel sprouts a standout. I had mussels, which were fresh, spicy and generous in size.  For our mains, the swordfish got rave reviews while my Veal Chop was good, but needed a bit more seasoning to draw the flavors out.   Finally, we had the ricotta cheesecake, which was tremendous.  In summary Vivace has aged well and is now a reliable New Italian option. There are others in Charlotte that are pushing the culinary envelope in more interesting ways, but if you want a consistent experience you could do a lot worse than Vivace."}
{"text":"Here is my take: Cocktails and appetizer course(calamari) - eh. Tasteless except for the peppers.  Bread service - eh. A tasteless bean spread and I mean tasteless. Really off the mark. Thin slice bread. I've been to Italy many times and never ate bread like this. They put it through a slicing machine, best I can tell.  Pasta course - eh also. Came to the table absolutely cold. Pasta was al dente though.  Main course - right on the money. Very good. Portion size is good and cooked as desired.  Wine and desert and coffee - very good also. Sizable wine selection of Italian wines. Impressive. Espresso served hot and with proper utensil (demitasse spoon).  Service - ok but a bit unprofessional. I like a little more formal approach and a knowledgeable wait staff. But ok. For all that wine, the place should have a wine steward on staff. How else would they be able to recommend all those $200 and up wines correctly? Our waitress was clueless when it came to wine.  3 1/2 stars. Best I can do."}
{"text":"Delicious night out. The space is large, contemporary and edgy. The calamari was crispy but not greasy and the pasta was rich and authentic. The down side was their salmon was dry & over salted."}
{"text":"Trusted the Yelpers' reviews and tried this place out. Definitely worth it.  Wow this place is beautiful! This an opera house or a restaurant? Kidding. Mostly.  Haven't seen this mentioned much, but the menu does offer both vegetarian and gluten free options. Can't vouch for any of them as I like dead animals.  Skipped the Salmon and Tuna, as those are not Italian pesce. Purist in somethings. Went with the Pork Due. Asked for it blushing pink inside and they nailed it. Flavorful, moist and well, yummy.   Negative: wine list offerings seem to be put together by the distributor (not unusual). They need to be paired better with the menu offerings. Beers as well."}
{"text":"Very good food and service! They also have valet parking! The only negative is that it was hot outside and I had to wait a little bit for my car. Try the bottomless mimosas!"}
{"text":"Between the great atmosphere, the friendly waitstaff, and the delicious food, there are so many good things I could say about Vivace.  As expected with an Italian restaurant, the wine selection is very nice.  They have a simple, one-page menu, but what they make, they make really well (besides, too many options can be overwhelming).  On this particular occasion I tried a few of their brick oven pizzas (I would highly recommend the Amor di Carne), and for dessert... OH MY GOSH are they generous with their gelato!  I couldn't even finish a 1-scoop serving.    One of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"The food wasn't all that great but the bean dip with the bread was really good, and I'm betting there are some other really good options. The ambience is what makes the 4 stars worth it. It's a beautiful restaurant with a nice view and mod layout."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for 5 in advance. We go there on Saturday night and they set us sitting on the big table with other group. The only thing separated us was two big vases between us. Our food wasn't the greatest. Their bread smelled like it was smoked on the grill and our salad had dirt all over it and it seemed like it wasn't washed. We call the manager and he took the salad away. I hope they can fix their issues and keep their customers happy."}
{"text":"I went around 1pm on a saturday for brunch.. the service was horribly slow considering the room wasnt even full of guests. I got the mussels and its an extremely small bowl for the price, but they did taste good. If the service was faster I might have had a better experience, but every time we wanted a refil or to order food we had to wave down our server every time."}
{"text":"I dined at vivace two days ago. I had a large party of 14 for a surprise birthday brunch for my boyfriend. One of my guests reviewed the restaurant on Facebook and described a mishap they had with seating before we arrived. I have included vivace's response to his review as well as my own person experience....    (unbelievable at how the restaurant responded to a poor review. Is this the owner's Facebook? Is this the manager's Facebook?)   \"I was the one that made the reservation with vivace. I was told on the phone that unless this was a surprise celebration the entire party must be present to be seated. I gave my credit card info because I was told that for every guest that didn't show up, I would be charged $10. Okay fine. I wanted to come there. The day before the brunch I contacted vivace to update my head count and changed it to a higher amount. I reiterated on the phone that this was indeed a surprise brunch. I told the hostess my guests would be arriving around 2 and I would be arriving with the birthday boy around 2:20. She said that was fine and we would be accommodated. I did not realize the trouble that my guests went through trying to be seated until after I had arrived. This is quite embarrassing for me since I was the one inviting the guests. Our waitress Heather was so nice and very apologetic for the mishap. She gave us great service and was well compensated. All of the attending guests plus ourselves are in the service industry. As my guests left one by one, four of us remained. The endless mimosas and bloody Mary's ended at 3:45 and by this time it was 4:00. I asked my waitress if we could move to the bar downstairs so she could finish cleaning and end her shift... The manager wearing the football jersey cut her off and rudely input that they were closed and we would have to leave. The waitress apologized for his grouchiness after he walked off. I brushed it off, after all no one died. As we went downstairs and said our goodbyes near the elevators. The bartenders and managers could be seen rolling their eyes at the remaining 5 guests seated in the bar area. Wow. How obvious. Disappointed at the response on my guest's review. How embarrassing. Guess they are doing so good they can afford to lose 14 customers. \""}
{"text":"Well...this place was pretty good...not great I'm afraid. Vivace has held a solid spot for awhile at the Metropolitan  My only encounter with the place was at a nicely executed cocktail party years ago, so I decided to take visiting family there.  Service was delayed due to poor timing of seating us to quickly after a giant table. We waited nearly 10 minutes for our server while another woman who brought us water (and claimed that was her only function on the staff that night) chatted to us kindly and politely answered our menu questions before tearing herself away to serve more water (I guess). I kind of think that any place that staffs people just to fill water glasses should be able to better handle taking care of relatively easy tables.  Although most of the food was good, I really wasn't wowed by anything. We had mussels followed by a mixture of specials and menu entrees. The mussels were strong flavored (livery) and briny. I was okay with the intense flavor, but the rest of the table didn't care for them. My wine glass appeared 10 minutes before the wine, served from a small carafe (always thought this was weird- either bring the glass of wine and repeat what I ordered, or serve it right from the bottle!). There were 4 of us, and we got exactly 4 pieces of bread-don't go overboard, guys!  Entrees, all seafood, were very good. Side items and salad were great. The kitchen did well On ambience- Several other large parties were seated and we soon found that the dining room can get so loud you can't hear your fellow diners. (Indoor voices, geez people...) so, another note would be that it's pretty loud on weekend nights. Had service been a little better, the entire experience would have been better. Since the food was good, I will probably give it another try at a later date."}
{"text":"Vivace was a fun place to have dinner with a family member on a recent trip to my former hometown. We arrived at 8 on a Friday night and the place was still jam-packed. As the evening wore on, the number of diners decreased and the number of lounge drinkers upstairs increased. The upstairs area (which has a full bar) would be a fantastic space to reserve for a rehearsal dinner or other special event. There is an open patio that has a fantastic view of downtown Charlotte.  The food was pretty good - nothing to write home about, but nothing to complain about either. The service was spectacular - we had a very nice waitress who helped us pick out things to eat and drink. The atmosphere is on the trendy/hip side, but nothing too obnoxious. Lots of seating available for both couples and larger groups.  Overall, I probably wouldn't return here when I visit, but if I lived in town, I might hit it up again with a group of friends. I'd definitely go for a drink on that upstairs patio with the view."}
{"text":"I love this place!!   Why 5 starts?  Maybe we ordered the right thing... But one thing for sure was the service!!!! We had the best waitress ever, even I forgot her name! Good service makes more enjoyable.  Then the restaurant itself , very romantic inside, perfect for dating or even for meetings. Nice designed, very open.   Lastly- the amazing food that we ordered:   Steam fresh mussel, just so freaking amazing and fresh!!! Wow wondering if I can make it at home, light sauce but so clean, and brings out the taste of the mussels!!! Great appetizer!!   House sausage pizza, fresh bake on too of a piece of wood, the sausage just so delicious, so moist as well, the pizza it self was thin and crispy, love it!!!!!!!!!!   Last and the best -- the scallop, OMG, they were not only BIG, but fresh and soft , perfectly COOKED!!!!!!! Even the sides of the scallop... Yummy, so unforgettable!!! Wish this place is right next to where I live so that I can order this every time!!!! Super fresh sea food!!!! Must try!!!!"}
{"text":"I won't be spending my money here. Last time I tried to come here was for my friend's birthday party. She had a reservation yet they didn't tell her any policies up front about needing the whole table there prior to being seated. They forced us to wait in a crowded lobby on a hot day instead of having us sit down and start drinking. Hey if I'm a server, I know that drinks drive up the bill. Anyway, the general manager was really condescending and talked to my friend as though she were a child by giving her a lecture. His tone was nicer toward white clients whereas the majority of the people in our party were people of color. This is a racist establishment. Please notice the trend amongst the Yelpers. A lot of the negative reviews come from people of color but several white people seem to think this place is outstanding. We took our business elsewhere. I suggest you do the same!"}
{"text":"Been here numerous times for brunch! My friends and I always uber here bc they have a weekend special that gives you unlimited mimosas, an appetizer, and an entree for $30! They also have complimentary valet parking, if you decide to drive. This place is a brunch staple!"}
{"text":"I come to town quite often for work and this place will definitely be one of my new go-to's. The food was awesome. I love Italian food I had the mussels and the gnocchi, both delicious. The service was great too. I know serving a table of one can be kind of a let down... not quite the tip one would get from a party of 4. Usually I just sit at the bar to make it easy... but Hillary went above and beyond to make me feel comfortable. I totally forgot I was there by myself. Hopefully she'll be there on my next trip!"}
{"text":"Friday was my second time at Vivace and both times were wonderful! I had the salmon and I have had the duck. Both meals were beyond perfect. The alcohol prices were a little too much, but the atmosphere and the food won me over.   I will be returning. OFTEN!"}
{"text":"I made a reservation for brunch yesterday (Sunday) since my friend from Ireland was in town. It was her birthday and she mentioned that she wanted to sit outside on the patio to celebrate. I notated this when I made the reservation and the hostess said they could accommodate. When we arrived at our scheduled time, they told us that we couldn't sit outside and that they take outside requests but not reservations. This is something completely different than what I was told on the phone. So, we agreed to take a table inside. The host did not seat us until 30 minutes after our scheduled reservation. Our time at the restaurant was a little over 2 hours and all we got were entrees, a few coffees and two mimosas. Never saw a Manager or anyone apologizing for the delays. I get that Sunday brunch is always busy, but when you try and make time for your friends birthday, who's visiting out of town and the experience is this bad, it makes me not want to come back. Normally, I go to Vivace at least once a month because the food is always good. But this time really made me rethink my love for this place."}
{"text":"Brunch review, the unlimited mimosa deal is great. I had the carbonara which was very good, super heavy and I couldn't finish it but that was probably because I drank so many mimosas! The service was good for the most part, the waitresses definitely were a little overwhelmed with all the people waving their glassses for unlimited mimosas!"}
{"text":"Sangria wasn't anything special. The carbonara is interesting. The pasta was homemade and al dente. Peas were crunchy and undercooked but not in a bad way. Four cheese ravioli was amazing. The scallops are very fishy but a nice light plate. Bread comes with hummus instead of butter which is a really great, healthy surprise!"}
{"text":"I have gone for both brunch and dinner.    The brunch service was slow, we had to ask 4 different times for coffee!  Once the food did arrive, was very pleased.  It was the same quality taste and ingredients that I've come to expect from Vivace after going for dinner.  The dinner is amazing!  I've had nothing but great experiences here for dinner, even during restaurant week when its a little overwhelming.  An impressive date night or special occasion place, but I go just cause I feel like it when family is in town as well."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch is NOTHING without Hillary! If you don't have her then I'm sorry. This girl is everything! She makes a great conversation, is super fun, and I wish we could take her with us on our Sunday Funday!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation here for two people and was seated 45 minutes after my reservation. They looked like they were behind or scheduled reservations too close together. The food was good, not great but good. The restaurant did have a nice atmosphere and my waiter was courteous."}
{"text":"While waiting for our table we decided to grab a drink at the bar. We saw not one but two ROACHES scurry across the bar top. We notified the bar lead as well as the manager. They were nice and bought our round of drinks at the bar and offered a free dessert. But that was it and it seemed like I had to haggle with the manager just to get that.( the manager on duty couldn't even make that decision he had to call the GM and ask what to do) While I was talking to the manager he proceeed to tell me he has seen them too. Why would Tell a customer that there a more critters than what they saw? I have worked  in the restaurant industry in the past for 7 years and I have NEVER seen a roach in a restaurant or seen a staff handle the situation that way. I only stayed for the bottomless mimosas Bc I was celebrating my birthday. The dessert was nasty. The server was nice"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend came here for a special event on a Sunday afternoon. Quite surprised we were one couple of maybe 2 or 3 other groups in the restaurant. We chose to sit outside(for the view OF COURSE!) it was such a beautiful sight to see. Our server was Joseph, he stated he was new but he was terrific! I ordered the Pappardelle and it was delicious!  The place is a little pricy but well worth it if you want some good food. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great.   The quality of the steaks suck.   I expect better quality for this price point."}
{"text":"A group of friends went for a Sunday fun-day brunch! Bottomless mimosas, amazing cuisine, and great staff. The NEW dessert menu was incredible. Highly recommend for a date night, birthday, engagement party and the list continues."}
{"text":"The hubs and I ate at Vivace last night for dinner. Kitchen renovations are ongoing so we continue to cut a swath through the culinary scene of CLT. I had completely forgotten that I had a gift card for this place and it had been quite some time since I'd been there. I do always love the patio, though, and given that this was the first super gorgeous spring day that we've had, it was a no-brainer that we needed to make this happen. Stat.   I made a reservation for 5:30 since we both work uptown and it's easy to get to Vivace from work. I also wanted to make sure to reserve a patio table in case the entire city decided to converge on this beautiful patio just like I planned to. In my experience, this town loves nothing quite so much as a warm, sunny day and you'll be hard pressed to find a seat on a patio on those days. Apparently my patio-day ideas aren't actually that unique.   I arrived before the hubs and sat enjoying the combination of a cool glass of wine, the warm sunshine and the striking view of Charlotte's skyline. I was a little Zen-ed out by the time he showed up, I'm not going to lie. After much deliberation over the menu (more than one or two things sounded good), I ordered a caesar salad and the four cheese ravioli. Hubs ordered the caesar salad and the corzetti with wild boar. I had almost ordered this myself as I'd never heard of corzetti before. I checked the menu earlier in the day and googled it. (I like to be prepared!) It's a flat round pasta shaped like a large coin.  The salads came out and were okay. They were very lightly dressed so many of the pieces of romaine just tasted like bare romaine. Is it uncouth to wish for more dressing on one's caesar? I'm not talking a metric ton of it, but just enough that it doesn't seem like I'm just eating plain lettuce. However, the lettuce was crisp and the flavor was good. It was definitely edible and not something I was upset enough about to send it back. Also I was really hungry.  The entrees came and were both quite pleasing to look at. My ravioli had a light tomato sauce that was complementary instead of overpowering. The garlic crèma was delicious. The pasta was topped with wilted spinach, which I don't normally eat, but I included in my bites so I could say I have a vegetable with dinner. It was good with the pasta. Hubs really liked his pasta and he doesn't ever like restaurant pasta. I had to talk him into the dish so I was relieved that he enjoyed it. The wild boar ragout was the perfect complement to the corzetti and the cheese.   Both pastas were the epitome of what I look for in restaurant pasta - unique in some way, fresh and certainly nowhere near just a mess of soggy noodles drowned in a tasteless red sauce. I feel like so many places still serve pasta that way and both hubs and I always steer clear. This was different and delicious.   The service was good, but got a little harried toward the end. I got a fresh glass of wine, which I had almost finished by the time the waiter came back to see what drink hubs wanted next. But looking around, it seemed like he was covering all the patio tables and it was pretty full by this time. I think he should've had some help as he looked like he was spread pretty thin so I'm not blaming him for the snafu. He was very friendly, though, and knowledgable about the food.   In all it was a very positive experience. I got to sit in the sunshine and enjoy some good food and good wine. And I'll almost definitely be back, probably to try the brunch I keep hearing so much about. Bottomless mimosas? I'm in!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately had a terrible experience at Vivace. I went here for my 23rd birthday which I had a reservation for however they were clearly very unprepared. I made the reservation over a week out and first off was told that if my number was off by 3 to 4 people they would charge me $150. This is absurd when I am trying to bring them business. Once we all arrived we were sat at 12:15 we had two servers (which you would think could handle 15) our drinks took about 20 minutes to come out then we sat for another 30 before they asked if we would like to order. We then waited 45 minutes for appetizers to come out and then an additional 45 minutes for our food to come out which they got one persons order wrong and the drinks were not refilled. Not only did one person speak to the manager but two and he just continued to avoid our table. They also normally do something for birthdays and did nothing for mine. At the end it took 20 minutes for checks to come out. Brunch at 12 lasted till almost 3 and there was no discount or compensation. It also ended with the female server telling me sorry I know it was your birthday, but sometimes things don't always happen they way we want them to on our birthday. I am extremely disappointed with the lack of care and service since I thought (past tense) so highly of this place and to be honest am embarrassed I invited guests to join me for a birthday here. Not only did you lose one customer but you lost an additional 15 of all the people that attended. Don't waste your time coming here"}
{"text":"Honestly, the decor is great, the food is ok, but the staff and service are the worst!  I don't know where they hire the people that work there, but I am so over how we are treated everytime we walk in the door.    As residents of the Metropolitan, you would think they would at least remember that we lived upstairs, but after a year and a half, nothing.  They are rude, unprofessional, and completely unaware.    We have tried to give them several chances and tonight was our last.  We called in to order food for \"pick up\" and they told us it would take 40 min before our food would be ready.  We waited upstairs, in our home, for 40 min, walked downstairs to grab our food, and the bartender says, \"wow, I thought I would be getting a free dinner tonight because I didn't think you guys were coming!\".  I then told him, we were told to come in 40 min, and he backtracked by saying, \"oh yea, it has been really busy tonight, it probably did take about 40 min\".  No it didn't because our food was cold and had clearly been sitting there for a while.   Then he tells us, if he were us, he would have came a bit earlier to grab drinks while we waited for our food.  If we wanted to do that, we would have.  We just wanted to order a quick meal to take back up to our place...we definitely did not need him to tell us, \"what we should have done\".   Almost all of the residents feel the same about Vivace, so I doubt any of their business comes from us, which reflects poor management.    I don't even have the time to get into everything else they have done to piss us off in the past year.  My $$ and business will continue to go to Dressler's and Pisces where they treat the locals like family.  Take a hint Vivace."}
{"text":"Solid 4 Stars. Hip crowd, delicious food, great atmosphere.   We had reservations for 8:30 on a Saturday night and arrived with the place in full swing. We started with cocktails at the bar (yum) and then proceeded to our table where we dug into delicious, doughy bread, a flatbread appetizers, almonds/olives and more wine. For dinner I had the chicken with sweet potato polenta and some sort of delicious sauce. Others at the table had salads and pasta. All were decadent and amazing. We thoroughly enjoyed this meal and would be back for round 2 any time."}
{"text":"Are you looking for a waitress that is perfect and has amazing hair and is almost TOO chill but also extremely attentive and perfect???? Ask for Mackenzie. We LOVED her. I'm gonna scream because she made my whole day! She served Us on the patio. It was a hot day but I was never warm because of how often she made sure I had an ice cold refreshing beverage. I can't wait to come back next week."}
{"text":"Approved. Delicious food and really really great atmosphere. Highly recommended. Sunday brunch was packed and the wait staff was unable to keep up with everything. Hangar steak with eggs was good and the spaghetti with meatballs looked really good. The portions were a little small, but perfect for all those young skinny bankers who like to hang out at places like this. Sit outside if you can. I'd go back."}
{"text":"Here last night for dinner and I am IN LOVE! The decor is uber-chic with the warm tons and super cozy patio couches (upstairs and downstairs). My friend and I ate on the patio downstairs which overlooks the walking path, so perfect for a lazy Sunday experience.   Two tiny bads upfront: the Sangria; they only have red and it was pretty watered-down boring with only bar fruit. Weird. We switched to the house Merlot shortly thereafter which was fine. The service was sloooowwww which was odd since it was not very crowded. Tolerable, but slow.   The entrees, fantastic. They are about $23-$24 a piece. I had the duck, medium. It was unreal!!!! Delicious sauce and fantastic presentation. (Yes you must laugh with your date at this point recalling Christmas Story and no the duck does not come out with its head still on!!) :-D It was tender and sweet....perfection and well worth the wait. The risotto accompaniment was salty and not overdone - LOVED it!!   My friend got the crab-stuffed trout which he devoured. He totally got the Clean Plate Award and wouldn't let me try any of it! A sign that he was in love also (at least with the trout lol).   They will let you make reservations here for the patio if you have something coming up and want to be sure to be seated outside. A lot of restaurants won't guarantee patio, they will do a 'first come first served' basis for patio seating - blah..I don't like that (ahem Bricktops!!!) And when you make reservations you will get in their system...where they also log any allergies or special requests with your information - very nice!!! Love you Vivace!!! Cant wait to be back! :-D"}
{"text":"Decent food at an affordable price. However the Asian hostess was outwardly rude to us for Easter brunch. She should not be in the food industry, or in any job that involves speaking to human beings. Other than than major setback, we had a good time."}
{"text":"i like their lunch better than dinner but both are good.  had lunch here again yesterday.  grilled salmon dish was excellent.  perfectly cooked and seasoned.  service was also very good"}
{"text":"This was my first time having brunch at this location. I typically go to Tupelo café or Terrace Café. The wait was not too long however it was very busy. I didn't really prefer sitting in the bar area because it was a lot of noise and foot traffic. When my friend and I first got there and the waiter was nice, however I could tell that the staff was overwhelmed by the crowd and it took a bit to get out order and drinks however the manager came by and the service got better. If you were thinking about visiting this place for brunch I would highly recommend you come around 11 or wait till around one or 130 after the rush. I have been here for dinner and the food is very good as well as the service.   There is free valet and the parking is free as well in the garage however it is not that great to maneuver around sense it gets quite busy with all of the other retail shops. One thing I can say that stands out about this restaurant is the view of the city as well as the Greenway. It really showcases the city's beauty.  Oh and one more thing, the price is relatively good for brunch you can have bottomless mimosas and two menu items one including an appetizer and main dish for 25 bucks. For dessert it is an extra five dollars. Not too bad when comparing the other restaurants that provide brunch w/no bottomless mimosas."}
{"text":"I really love Vivace. They have a great atmosphere (especially when it's warm and you can sit outside with views of the city and the greenway) and excellent food. The pastas come in small and large portions that are priced fairly - the small is enough for one, the large will fill you up too much so take some home! I've tried many of the pizzas (love them all), the squid ink pasta (absolutely incredible and unique), and the veal (solid). The salads are tasty, as well. The wine and beer lists are varied enough to provide something for various palettes (which is VERY important since every Italian meal should be accompanied by a glass of something boozie)! Bonus points for complimentary valet parking at the worst parking place in all of Charlotte.   See you soon, Vivace!"}
{"text":"I liked this place.  It was very crowded and busy the night i went but we got a table in the bar area.  The service was good and the food was well done.  The right portion sizes and everything was fresh.  I had braised pork agnolotti with carmelized pears and blue cheese and it was fantastic.  Wife had spaghetti and meatballs which she thought was ok - the sauce is a bit sweet so if you dont like that i wouldnt recommend this dish.  Friends had the scallop risotto and the smoked chicken agnolotti.  I thought all dishes were excellent.  When i return to Charlotte i would go to this place again and will definitely recommend it to friends.  Prices were not that bad either."}
{"text":"Worst ever .. I do LA snobby spots but come on... This is Charlotte ... Hostess - said wait was 15 minutes .. When I came back to check 25 minutes later with plenty of tables around she was too busy flirting with servers ..& when I tired of waiting she laughed at us ..  Bar - great ambience ... Except for snobby server .. Who couldn't be bothered to serve us .. Take our order .. Never smiled and took over 5 minutes in an empty bar for two cocktails and a beer .. This girl never made eye contact, was short and rude ...  We decided to close the tab and leave after waiting over 30 minutes ....  Pass For me ..:"}
{"text":"We had reservations for 1pm, we're not seated until 2 p.m. . Did not receive a food until 3 p.m. . At best food was okay. The braised short rib hash was horrific. At best it was a beef stew with no flavor. sing to be a popular place not sure why based on the service and quality of food that I received today."}
{"text":"Vivace was a very stylish place to grab dinner. The service was wonderful, our waiter was sweet and helpful. We told him our budget for wine and he had very helpful suggestions and even served us a bottle typically sold by the glass, not bottle, to satisfy our wants! He gave great suggestions throughout the night and even took our valet ticket down for us so that our car was waiting when we left the restaurant.    We, two girls out for a birthday, started with the cheese and meat plate where you can choose from a list of well-appointed selections. We then had a pizza and two small plates - scallop risotto and pasta bolognese - to share. The pizza's crust was perfect and the toppings were of great quality. The scallops were cooked perfectly and the risotto was creamy. The amount of food was perfect for us to get full and also to sample multiple things.   Only downfall was the noise in the upstairs area. We were seated at a very nice table by the window, but unfortunately, in the center of the room was a ten-person group that were so loud. Like Real Housewives of Charlotte loud. They basically made it impossible to hear anything besides their conversation. Once their food came out, they quieted down. Other than the noise, the place was great!"}
{"text":"Vivace is not your ordinary Italian restaurant. It is \"go to\". I like to start with their Calamari with spicy tomato aioli. Their cured meats and cheeses make for a great starter too. Try the Smoked Chicken Ravioli for the main course. It comes complete with sundried tomatoes, porcini mushrooms and madeira creama. The chocolate cheese cake is a good choice for desert."}
{"text":"Insanity is defined as doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different outcome, so my returning to Vivace after more than one failed meal is on me.  As I mentioned in my previous review, Vivace is a running joke amongst my friends and me, as we all agree the food is awful, but the location is convienent, their outdoor patio very inviting, and we like the bottomless mimosas on Sunday afternoons.  When I wrote my last review, I did note that their head chef, who was absent last summer, had returned to the kitchen, so when my friend suggested our brunch group give Vivace another go today, I was game.  It was a beautiful day to sit outside on Vivace's beautiful patio overlooking the downtown greenway-great for people watching.  The menu was exactly the same as last year-even if their food was good- it is not a very inviting or cohesive selection.   I had a pannini with tomato, fresh mozzerilla, and basil pesto, and for my side, the house salad.  The salad was fine- hard to mess up.  The \"paninni\" was not a paninni-the tomato, mozzerilla and pesto was served on a chabatti roll, and the sandwich was not grilled- which is what a paninni is- a grilled sandwich.  The cheese was semi-melted, so I guess some attempt at heating it was made, but when it arrived at the table it was cold-fail.  I ate part of half, and the side salad- what a waste of money.  And- they have discontinued the bottomless mimosas- so no need to return.  Too bad- such a great space in a great location- I wish someone who knew good food would intervene and make a go of this place"}
{"text":"Went for restaurant week, it was okay but not the best Italian I've had in the area.  App: Duck Confit Arancini the arancini was good but didn't really have much duck flavor. The plum agrodolce accompanying it on the other hand was excellent.   Entree: Grilled mahi with melted tomatoes, potatoes and crispy brussels sprouts. The mahi, tomatoes and potatoes were fine but not spectacular. The brussels sprouts were clumsy, under-seasoned and a bit burnt.  Desert: Hazelnut panna cotta. The panna cotta was light and very enjoyable the hazelnut was imperceptible.   I would go to Fiamma or Moffett's new place Stagioni  instead, given the choice."}
{"text":"Meh, that's how I would describe my experience. Not good, not bad just meh. This is the kind of place that tries to be fancy and pretentious but falls short with mediocre food and service. First off, the panting situation is awful. I had to drive around the parking deck for 15 mins looking for a spot, not their fault but definitely a deterrence for some to come back. When I arrived it was pouring rain, the valet boys were standing at the front door and didn't even both to open the door me as I struggled to close my umbrella and not get drenched. That's just common curtesy in my book. Walking in I asked the hostess to direct me to the bar, she seemed annoyed by that, sorry my bad!  I grabbed a seat at the bar and was greeted by the bartender. After beginning to look at the menu for a few moments he realized he had given me the wrong one, whoops. I inquired about w gluten free menu which their website says they have. It's also written on the bottom of their regular menu that a gluten free menu is a available. However I was told by the bartender that there wasn't one and that they could just modify most thing. This was slightly confusing. I had also reviewed the menu online and had an idea what I wanted prior to arriving but once I got there the menu was completely different than the one online, that was disappointing.   I ended up ordering a pasta dishes called Bugatini with gluten free noodles, basically it was just a spicy red sauce. It was fine but certainly nothing special and not worth $18. Overall, it was just okay, nothing worthy of a second visit."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Vivace... love the upscale rendition of classic Italian cuisine. Normally I like my Italian food in the hole-in-the-wall place with the red and white checkered table covering and the home-cooked style that tastes like Grandma is cooking in the back.  So when I think about fine dining, my mind normally doesn't go to Italian (unless I'm in NYC), but Vivace does a great job.  Only reason I dinged them a star is that the Raleigh location seems to have better quality food... not sure if its a talent or food supply issue, but I think consistency is important for a 5-star and CLT has a bit of catch-up to do with Raleigh.  On a final note, it is refreshing to see an Italian restaurant stick with an all-Italian wine list!  There's a reason why Italian cuisine goes so well with Italian food - it is not a coincidence.  So to not see the \"Harris Teeter\" collection of wines here was great and the bottle selections are awesome... coming from a guy who is obsessed with Italian wines."}
{"text":"The more I go to Vivace, the more I like it. This place is fantastic! I have a lot of respect for their originality and creativity.  A small group of us went for brunch yesterday. $25 gets you an appetizer, main course and either bottomless Mimosas or Bloody Marys.   The Bloody Mary mix here has a bite - lots of pepper and horseradish - a nice dense, delicious, refreshing house blend.  I enjoyed the PEI Mussels to start, again some heat, reminiscent of GB's Fiery Mussels but I do have to say the Brussel Sprouts with bacon and potatoes (as much as we've all seen Brussel Sprouts this past year) were simply awesome.  The main course was a tough choice - plenty of great sounding choices to pick from. I opted for Eggs in Purgatory. Whoa momma! Great stuff! A chunky bed of spicy red sauce with Guanciale (cured pork jowl - tastes kind of like a cross between salami and pancetta) and Calabrian Peppers. Add two pieces of smoky grilled bread with perfectly poached eggs on top. I did not regret my choice, at all, but I did get to sample the Short Rib Hash and Quiche Fiorentino (a slab of a portion), both of which I wouldn't hesitate to order next time.  Brunch was indeed impressive. I really enjoyed sitting upstairs as well = much better views of outside and the downstairs dining room. Great service, great price. Very busy on Sundays so make a reservation!!!"}
{"text":"L*O*V*E Vivace! Great food and great decorating design makes the experience all that much more pleasing. Very well thought out layout. I enjoy my girls nights out on the patio for a cocktail, lemoncello mojito is my personal preference. Great datenight spot as well.  The mussels are amazing.  If you have a gluten alergy, here is a place that caters just to that and meatless options, an entire menu, how considerate! The service is always on point and they have the food to back it up."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Calamari was easily in the top 5 I have had... Margarita pizza wasn't really traditional, but still looked and tasted great"}
{"text":"Excellent meal.  Comfortable atmosphere. Very attentive service.  The mussels are delightful, as is the salmon.  Apricot cheesecake was a great desert.   Server Rachel did a fantastic job.  Thanks."}
{"text":"Our dinner was fantastic!  The new menu and chef were superb!  To top it off we had an unbelievable server --Nina made the evening outstanding!"}
{"text":"I've been to Italy. I've tasted the perfect \"al dente\" achieved only by master Italian artisans, and gorged on the sweet coffee-soaked lady fingers at the bottom of my tiramisu. I've finished meals off with the carefully measured portion of limoncello and watched fresh basil bake into the home-made mozzarella of a crisp wood-fired pizza as the pomodoro sizzles gently underneath.   I find myself back in Rome when I visit Vivace; a masterpiece of fine dining and a treasure found in the heart of Charlotte. Wonderfully contemporary, yet traditional at heart, this restaurant evokes everything one would expect from a top-tier Italian restaurant.   We began the meal with the Gnocchi alla Romana with spicy sauteed shrimp, white wine and herb crema. Each flavor danced in my mouth after every bite, distinguishing itself through the freshness of ingredients and mastery of cooking technique. The primi was followed by a Chicken Cappelini (housemade pasta) tossed in a sun-dried tomato cream sauce, crispy pancetta, and topped with arugula. The richness of this dish was not overpowering and the saltiness of the pork rounded the dish off well, thereby achieving perfect balance in taste. I then finished with an enormous portion of Italian gelato and of course, an arancello (a sweet concentrated shot of sweet orange liquor 40% av.) to take me to the next level :)  Our server was prompt, kind, and knowledgeable. He had wonderful recommendations and even replaced a melting gelato of his own volition because he had thought it was overly melted.   It's restaurants like these that deserve recognition and acclaim in the wider gastronomic community. I commend the staff here and will be back again soon.  5/5"}
{"text":"I usually give pretty great reviews, however I unfortunately was quite disappointed with my experience here. To start, we had a reservation at 8:00 and were not seated until 8:30 or later. Once we sat down, we did not have a waitress and after quite some time, we had to ask for water. My meal was not very flavorful and I was unhappy with it. They forgot to bring out my dessert, even after they severed the 3 others at my table. We were not given any silverware and it took at least twenty minutes for the wine we ordered to be brought to our table. I understand it was Restaurant Week and a busy time, however we were disappointed with the service and the overall meal quality. Such a let down!"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch and was not disappointed. My husband had the shaved Brussels sprouts with bacon and a poached egg and even though I am not a fan of Brussels sprouts, this dish was excellent. I had mozzarella with arugula and roasted tomatoes and that also was very good. Main course of pappardelle with bolognese and goat cheese Crema and it was wow! The pappardelle was cooked to perfection and the flavor of the sauce was nice and very deep- loved it. Will definitely come back but later so we can order mimosas since they can't serve them before noon."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try Vivace after being in Charlotte for almost three years.  We were a little underwhelmed.  First off the prices and menu are slightly different then the one online.  I'm Italian and cook spaghetti for Sunday dinner every week so I know the cost of homemade spaghetti.  Online the price was $12 dollars which is a healthy price.  At the restaurant it was $17 dollars which I find a bit high when it was about $2 dollars worth of noodles.  There was also lot of pumpkin on the menu, which I find to be more of a fall ingredient then spring.  We did LOVE the white bean spread for the bread.  We had a vegetarian dining with us who ordered the Pumpkin Gnocchi but was given the regular meat version of it and our server never apologized just said she would fix it.  Luckily a manager came over and apologized and brought her another very quickly. We also had reservations but showed up only to wait close to 30 minutes for our table.  The had a big party of younger people who they sat in the direct center of the place creating a very loud, almost yelling atmosphere.  The food quality was really good, just other things overshadowed the actual food.  Not sure we'll be back with other great Italian options here in Charlotte."}
{"text":"As early as we got here, I didn't expect to see much activity. However at the early hour of 5:15 this place was going pretty strong and more people started at arrive.  Very nicely decorated and loved the open kitchen along with the light fixtures. We both didn't think the bread served was the best, as it was seasoned and served cold. However the rest of the meal was top notch.  Hubby went with the creamy tomato with goat cheese. It was excellent and natural flavor with a snippet of goat cheese that went perfectly together. We chose vivace meatball appetizer and the sauce was perfect. For an entree hubby went with scallop risotto that had a perfect sear and prosciutto that was flavorful and well balanced with snap peas.  As I dove with delight into the special - duck lasagna bolognese with house made cheese and layered veggies- it was without a doubt the best lasagne I have had in my life.  The best part is it will be added to the regular menu! Both of us too full for dessert- we left well fed and happy and the prices weren't out of line either. Having a nice deal to use helped - but without that I still think the meal was top notch, excellent service and reasonable for a High end Dining experience. Nice valet parking as well. Worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying that if you are a fan of architectural design, you have to visit this place! It's visually stunning with a warm feel but with a contemporary style which can sometimes be hard to pull off.  They do it perfectly!   Ok, so service was a little slow in the beginning during the drink order but became increasingly better.  In terms of drinks from the bar, the Sangria was lacking in my opinion.  A bit on the sour side to me.  I paired my meal with the house Merlot and it was just fine, perfect temp, etc.  The meal I ate was the crab stuffed trout on a bed of asparagus.  It was fantastic! Apparently I won the Clean Plate Award ;).  The crab stuffing was delicious and the presentation was spot on as well.  The best part about this place to me was the patio atmosphere upstairs.  They have a large moveable glass partition that opens up the second floor loft out into a patio area (w/heaters!) and the furniture is ultra comfortable.  A great spot to have a final glass of Merlot and wind down after the meal.  The only thing bringing this rating down to a 4 was the slow start and the Sangria....otherwise, total 5 star place."}
{"text":"The best afternoon Sangria I have ever had. Bartender was friendly and the atmosphere was laid back for a nice Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"Mama mia! Modern italian in Charlotte has never looked so good and been so easy on the budget.  In the marquee corner of the Metropolitan, this 2 story restaurant/bar has some excellent views of the uptown skyline and a sleek interior that oozes style and modern class.  Luckily,they've got a menu that is equally impressive for just about any palette.  The lower level consists of a large bar area and a medium-sized dining room with a large and impressive glass wine room smack dab in the center of the action.  A large wooden spiral staircase leads up to the second floor, where you'll find another (smaller) bar and more dining space.  In the warmer months, the large glass panes looking out towards the skyline can be opened and pushed back to lead to more lounge-type space for those just in for drinks or looking for a little al fresco dining.  Nice beer selection and an even better Italian wine selection from the bar.  There are also a full list of cocktails available.  I'm not a big fan of the $10 drink, but you can't escape that here.  Beers are about $4-5 and the wines cross just about all budget spectrums.  But all that aside, the food is the real star here.  Nice appetizer selection here that includes a big selection of cheese and charcuterie, which I am a sucker for.  I can't say enough how great it is to be able to pick amongst the different offerings to find a mix that works for you- want all cheese?  Get it.  Want double prosciutto?  Fine.  All come with an amazing chestnut honey and a couple of preserves.  Other apps include flatbreads and calamari but there is a lot more to choose from here.  Fresh warm bread comes on the side along with a white bean dip that could be an appetizer in itself.  For hard-core veggies, the caprese is also a fine selection.  From there, you can move onto a a selection of house-made pasta dishes or main plate features.  There's hanger steak and a number of fish offerings that are worthy of a go.  Everything I have had here is solid good. Whether it was a pasta dish or  For bonus points, I especially appreciate the kitchen turning a shared entree into 2 separate plates.  The wife and I routinely share 1 entree due to portion size bloat.   Each time we have done this at Vivace they have always brought us two plates, with the portions equally divided.  Nice!  We've also tried dessert here and I have found the offerings to all be good, but slight in terms of offerings.  Usually 4 or so choices.  The chocolate cake is smallish in size with a miniature scoop of ice cream.  I'd just go for dessert elsewhere, if needed that badly.  So lots of young and beautiful people frequent the downstairs bar.  It's definitely a see and be seen kinda scene.  Not the kind of place you want to go slum it for the night.  Wear your good stuff and get ready for some really well executed food.  Viva Vivace!"}
{"text":"Best brunch in Charlotte. Bottomless mimosa deal was incredible- $35 got you unlimited mimosas, a personal appetizer, and an entree. Service was always great too. Vivace was hands down my favorite spot in Charlotte during my time there. Food was always great and we liked the view on the patio of uptown. The MUSSELS, eggs in purgatory, and the chicken biscuit were a few of my favorites."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch and loved it. The mimosas are amazing (strong and bottomless!) and the food was fantastic as well. I had the Eggs in Purgatory, which had a fantastic sauce in addition to the brussel sprouts, which were also flavorful, albeit a little too oily. Overall, I loved Vivace and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great place! Heather was the best and the manager stopped by and checked on us. The food was wonderful, especially the brussel sprouts...yum ."}
{"text":"Great food and fantastic service. I booked a reservation for two the previous night and the hostess was very accommodating regarding a last minute third guest during a very busy brunch time. I have been to Vivace many times for their brunch, and it never disappoints; however, the service this time was spectacular. The waiter, Tony, was extremely impressive, friendly, and knowledgeable of the menu. Couldn't have asked for a better service! He anticipated our needs before we even had to ask for anything. I will definitely ask for Tony every time I go back to Vivace!"}
{"text":"Came here for drinks last fall. I liked the decor and vibe so I wanted to return for brunch or dinner. Went on a Sunday for Father's Day. There is a free parking lot that is shared for people and they have free valet. Despite it being a holiday it wasn't busy. Had a reservation,  but still waited 30 minutes to be seated. I mentioned in my online reservation I wanted to sit outside. Well they missed that and acted like it was a big deal to set up When only one party was outside at the time of our arrival. Waitress didn't go over menu or specials she missed brining our water to someone at our table and we had to ask 5 times to get it. It was warm outside and they served water with no ice. The food looks better then it tastes. It's very electric modern style of food. I will likely not return and overall don't recommend. My father and brother in law didn't enjoy the brunch and it was there day. The price we paid was decent. The service was lacking. There are so many great sports in Charlotte try something that will guarantee a great experience. Choose wisely."}
{"text":"I had brunch with a friend at Vivace today. They revamped their eggs Benedict to a vegetarian version which is delicious!!  Our server was Madeline and she did an excellent job explaining the changes to the menu. I ordered a ADD ON portion of scallops. They were $10 and they brought me two scallops. Kinda pricey for 2 scallops. It took 40 minutes to get a cappuccino at the end of our meal. Madeline was great and deducted it. Why punish the server when her restaurant failed her.  I came home and started thinking about those two expensive scallops and decided to call the manager. I phoned the restaurant and ask for manager. The host put me on hold and never returned. So at the 10 minutes of holding Mark - I hung up and phoned back. I ask for the manager again. This time I spoke with a female manager named Wyath. I'm sure I haven't spelled her name correctly. She listened to my concerns. She told me the scallops ADD ON was $6.00 for 2 scallops. I told her I was charged $9 and the menu Says they charge $10. Anyway....a mess.  So ask for specifics because even the manager doesn't know her menu. All in all.........poor response to a customer and loads of excuses.  Next-----------"}
{"text":"Exquisite service and phenomenal food!! When I arrived, I was seated immediately by a very friendly hostess. The server was very attentive and extremely familiar with the menu. For an appetizer I ordered the tomato bisque.... INCREDIBLE!! Our entrees were cooked to perfection and so was our dessert. Might I add, the restaurant was gorgeous and the atmosphere would be perfect for any occasion. If you live in Charlotte or are just passing through, I highly recommend dining at Vivace... you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went here on a Tuesday, first time. Place literally looked like it was completely empty, not a great sign. Wife and I looked at each other like, \"we should probably go\", glad we didn't. I had the scallops over risotto and being a risotto snob, I must say they did a great job with this dish. Why the place was so dead, I haven't a clue because service was spot on, and all dishes were very tasty. I have told others about our experience and I'm hoping this review ushers more consumers in because it's hard to find a restaurant that can prepare a good risotto."}
{"text":"Vivace lived up to the reputation of great food and service I had been hearing about. My friend and I started with two very nice Italian wines from their by the glass menu along with a bottle of chilled house water - love that. We shared their seasonal salad: roasted sweet potatoes, spicy pecans and goat cheese on fresh greens. We then ordered the smoked chicken and spinach agnolotti and the scallop risotto with roasted beets and wilted spinach.  Both entrees were really, really good. In fact, I know it won't be long before I return. It was that good."}
{"text":"Went here because my friend had a coupon. The food was pretty good and the atmosphere was much nicer than I anticipated. It's got 2 floors and an open layout near the heart of Uptown Charlotte. My friend and I shared two dishes: Corzetti and Pappardelle. Both were very delicious, but not worth the price had we not had a coupon. I also ordered a glass of sangria which, unfortunately, has been the most disappointing kind I've had in my life (albeit, I've been to Spain a couple times). I won't be coming back for the sangria, but I will for the food!"}
{"text":"Solid place for Sunday brunch! We got to Vivace around 1 pm, and by that time, the patio was already filled up (1.5 hour wait). Which was completely understandable knowing how gorgeous it was outside! We didn't want to wait though, so we sat ourselves in the bar area.  For $30 per person, you get never-ending mimosas (OJ only) and/or bloody marys, 1 Appetizer, and 1 Entree. For our appetizer, we ordered Crispy Brussel Sprouts (without bacon) and Mixed greens salad (without pistachios - I'm allergic). And for my entree, I ordered Penne Vodka (without shrimp - I'm vegetarian). The Brussel Sprouts and Penne Vodka were DELICIOUS. And the fact that they kept our mimosas flowing was the absolute best. Also, their hot sauce collection and spices selection was so large! The hot sauce I chose was 'Blistering Butthole' (LOL). It was really good.  4 stars for not enough veggie options, but I would go to this brunch again in a heartbeat. 100% recommend!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place in uptown charlotte. Modern feel with north Italian cusine. My wife and I went for brunch. We had the mussels and calamari to start. They were fresh and very delicious. Our entrées were the same. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch at Vivace was a great choice. I went with a party of 4 and we all did the Vivace way. I got the Caprese Salad, absolutely delicious, and the eggs in purgatory. Wow it was all delicious and we also throughly enjoyed the bottomless mimosas. The decor was really cool and open. I hope to return for more soon."}
{"text":"Visited Vivace for its Sunday brunch, which had come recommended to me. Nice outdoor seating great for a Sunday morning, but word to the wise, you can't take advantage of their mimosa or Bloody Mary bar until noon. Waiter was fairly inattentive and the prices did not reflect portion sizes/food quality. I would not recommend the American breakfast--sub-par bacon and eggs, though I did enjoy the parmesan polenta."}
{"text":"Vivace is quickly becoming a new obsession.  First off, their brunch special is incredible.  2 course plus unlimited Bloody Mary's or mimosas for $25.  They also just rolled out a new bar bites menu (the Brussels pizzetta with smoke mozzarella and caramelized onions is awesome and only $6)!  Add to this the patio with incredible view of uptown (and the greenway).  Awesome."}
{"text":"Yum!!! Came here for my friends 30th birthday part this past weekend and everything about the experience was great. The rooftop seating facing uptown Charlotte along with our wonderful waitress made everything awesome. They put a lot of emphasis on the birthday girl which was very much appreciated. We ordered many different items with the group and it all tasted delicious. The Cheese platter- Assortment of cheeses, jams and cured meats everything tasted fresh and was the perfect amount Caprese Salad- Delicious!  Smoked chicken ravioli - a little too smoked for my liking but all in all it was pretty decent Spaghetti - Just had spaghetti and not the meatbals but they cooked it in with red chili flakes to give it a kick and was a huge hit with everyone that tried it"}
{"text":"One of Charlotte's best Italian restaurants, Vivace serves up great food in a fantastic setting at Midtown's Metropolitan. In the heat of the summer, the cool, modern interior beckons you to enjoy a light meal and a few drinks, while the patio's spectacular Uptown views invite you outside in cooler weather.   I've paid a few visits to Vivace after a long day at the office, and absolutely love their Pappardelle entree, as well as delicious Gnocchi and Lobster Ravioli. For an appetizer, you can't beat either their Calamari or Bruschetta. There's a full bar and some wonderful local craft beers, although none of them are served on tap.   So swing up to Midtown one evening for an outstanding Italian meal in a great setting -- Vivace won't disappoint."}
{"text":"I've been to Vivace three times already and I'm not going to stop.  My first experience at Vivace was a bottomless mimosas & Bloody Mary's brunch- and I was not disappointed.   What to get at Vivace: - The Vivace Way Brunch-  antipasti + piatti and  bottomless Mimosa & Bloody Mary drinks for $30 - Caprese salad. Yum! - Summer Bibb salad. Fresh and tasty. - Shrimp and Grits. It's a southern specialty, and even though it's parmesan polenta, it tasted great. - Braised Short Rib Hash. So delicious, you'll order it over and over. - For dinner, try the Ahi Tuna Crudo. It's to die for.  Why go to Vivace: - Bottomless boozy brunches. - Sophisticated. - Convenient location. At the Metropolitan. - Good service.  - Can accommodate large groups. - Patio dining. - Gluten-free and Pescatarian menus.  Four and Half Yelps."}
{"text":"Went for brunch.  They refused to seat us without our entire party present which is confusing since WE HAD A RESERVATION!   Not like they were using the table.  Also 4 people at hostess stand chatting-- doing nothing while we stand awkwardly in front of door in everybody's way.  Would have been nice to be waiting with a drink!  Stupid policy."}
{"text":"The first time I reviewed was 3/2010...the first time we came and  we Were instant fans. ..great food and service...we've come many times since and have celebrated many occasions here...unfortunately our superb experiences have come to an abrupt halt tonight and the chance of us and bringing friends back is a big fat zero.  First off, before being seated, I went to use the ladies room and slipped on the greasy floor, tweaking my knee.  I then remembered the same thing happened the last time I was there. Why haven't they figured out why the floor is greasy? Yes, I did bring it to their attention.  Our waiter, Stephan, was good..attentive and answered questions. I should have taken heed when he said, the wild boar pasta dish is out of the box and tastes different-  was that code for having no taste? You would think that a pasta dish that had wild boar ragu would taste out of the box and out of this world (which from past experiences is what I expected)...however,  it didn't have much of any flavor. At least some herbs that would bring out an explosion of flavor, but there were none.   The big bomb came with the husband's veal saltimboco. The veal came out and there were two at the table who ordered. Within a few tries at cutting the veal, hubby and guest said this is wrong and way too tough. (now I see this was mentioned in another review) Stephan came over and got the manager, Jason. Hubby said do you know what the cut of veal is in here? No, I don't.  (Wrong answer..remember Hubby grew up in the meat department and knows his cuts of meat) Jason said he would check with the chef. So, they asked what other meal would you like,  which is always a problem  when everyone else has their meal already. The replacement meals were ordered and eventually delivered, after everyone else at the table was done and their plates cleared. Jason,the manager, never came back.  In,the meantime, another manager came to ask how the meal was and we explained that the meals had been sent back. he said he was,sorry and then left. None of the managers ever came back to say what the veal cut was or to follow up and see how the rest of the meal was. As we were leaving, hubby, who was very disappointed,spoke to Jason and inquired why didn't he follow up and why he didn't offer any compensation for the extended wait. Jason's reply was that management says we don't do that, we just replace the meal (and let everyone watch each other eat their meals). Obviously, the managers have no authority to make a decision and who knows where management is.Totally unresponsive and uncaring..not good customer service. There are way too many choices in Charlotte to act as if you are the only game in town.  I've put a lot of thought in to this review. .it's my birthday night and it was my choice to go to Vivace and now I've spent an hour writing this review when I should be enjoying my night,but I just don't want anyone else to be disappointed. I should say the replacement pork chop was very good, but the lack of attention by management was the reason for the 1 star."}
{"text":"A few drinks here on a Friday night is what I consider the best way to kick off the weekend.  The upstairs bar is the place to be if you want it a bit more quiet, though in the winter months it can get crowded with the outdoor area void of anyone."}
{"text":"Very nice spot.. celebrated my best friends birthday.. they took good care of him.. the waitress helped me with his cake.. even added a ton of candles.. mimosa's were on point.. food was good.."}
{"text":"Been to Vivace several times for their happy hour bar menu and for drinks. Beautiful restaurant. 2nd floor bar overlooking downtown Charlotte. Scallops with Risotto was awesome."}
{"text":"A Vivace Tale... A long, long time ago... there was a date night.... And it went a lil like this...  Well, wasn't the best experience for a restaurant, but the positives...  The waiter was very attentive.  I think I drank about a gallon of water before we got our appetizer, which was the eggplant dip (Perfect)   He also offered a GREAT wine which complimented the meal very well!  I try for a vegan diet, which can be hard if you don't call ahead, so the options here are extremely limited, I got a cheese-less pizza ( a fail-safe at any Italian establishment) and it was more of a tasteless one.  But the company was good :)  If you make a reservation, ask for a table that's separate from the wall or not along the windows.  Awkward Turtle moment when you have to move someones purse to get to your seat on the bench as they managed to cram an extra table in.  If you get stuck at one of those tables, be prepared to have little privacy and be involved in a myriad of conversations that are going on around you.  THEY GET A 4!  So, this is an update to an earlier review, I was contacted by a few of the customer service reps and they insisted we try it again!  So, they get a star for wanting to impress us!  I'm in!  LOL, so I will definitely update this soon!  Vivace is trying for a FIVE star, and I'm looking forward to it!  Once upon a giftcard...  So, thanks to an attentive management staff, we tried Vivace again... SCORE!  It was amazing!  We took the suggestion of wine and was without a doubt, right on point!   The chef prepared a 3 course vegan meal and it was A-Maze-Ing, I got lost in the flavors!  YUM!  The appetizer was a variation of Bruscetta that was made very decadently with butternut squash and flavored with vinaigrette.  Mouth waterin' good! :)  On to the main course, was a great hodge podge of arugula, shrooms, squash, broccoli and many more that I can't remember... Let's just say I got my servings in that day!  The flavor was awesome.  dessert was really done very well as well, with apples and cinnamon in a flaky pizza dough wrap topped with raspberry syrup and powdered sugar!  Welll, hheeelllooooo there!!!  Great job Vivace, we shall return,   And they lived happily ever after!  :-P"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, North Carolina has a rule on Sundays where you cannot serve alcohol until noon so I did not get to try out the bloody mary bar :(  However, I've been here a few times for brunch and dinner.... Great service, outdoor patio is awesome when it's nice outside.   Bruschetta appetizer is a great light start.  Brunch: Quiche is MASSIVE but delicious, frittata is just ok, eggs benedict is great!  The atmosphere has an upscale and open vibe.... highly recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"Beautiful and elegant atmosphere , impressive wine list, a menu that changes with the season but is consistently tasty, and one of the best patios in Charlotte.  Their $10 bottomless mimosas on Sunday may just be the best deal in town.  Not too bad, Vivace, not too bad..."}
{"text":"I have to say that Vivace has become my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. I'm not a big fan of The Metropolitan and it's \"big box\" tenants, but Vivace has created a great space both indoors and outside. As stylish as any major city restaurant. I have had a great meal every time I've visited for lunch or dinner. I especially like eating in the bar/lounge area. I sat upstairs once and it was incredibly noisy, but it was a packed Saturday night.  The only reason I'm not giving it \"5 stars\" is because of the rancid mussel in my bowl at lunch one day. They offered to replace the dish which seemed unappetizing at the time. If I owned the place, I would have offered another appetizer selection on the house, but they just took it off the bill and said no more. I have ordered the mussels since on another visit and they were exceptional. Although, if you're on a low sodium diet, find another selection. The broth is divine, but major salty.  Vivace is a good choice for any occasion..."}
{"text":"Rude staff, queen's feast is a disaster"}
{"text":"Before departing from Charlotte, I went with two of my friends to Vivace on a Sunday evening. The environment had been calling to me for a few months so I figured maybe last time was just a bad night and all of these 5-star reviews must be there for a reason...  But, alas.. Service was a bit slow, the wine was lovely, and I got stuck paying $20 again for incredibly mediocre vegetables. Seasoning, people, seasoning!  No bread this time around and my friends seemed to think the food was okay (one of which has been spoiled with Italian cooking from his mum) but it was nothing special.  Veggies beware: you'll pay a lot of money to be incredibly bored/underwhelmed with the food."}
{"text":"Had the bottomless mimosas which was great. The server was not in a very happy mood; she had a upset look but i didnt let that spoil my visit.  i had the calamari again which was even better than my first visit. I order the roasted chicken pizza which was AMAZING !!  Cant wait to go back again."}
{"text":"This is a trendy upscale Italian restaurant. Food is very good and the only reason I am giving it four stars it is a little pricey. The best deal is the brunch deal with the bottomless mimosa's! that's right bottomless - only place in Charlotte I have found with this deal. If you haven't been here and your a fan of brunch (which lets be real we all are) then I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Brand new to CLT and became acquainted with Vivace at the CLT Bloody Mary Festival.  The only restaurant to talk to us about their restaurant and invite us to come and check it out was Vivace.... Blythe and Trip!  Blythe is perfect person to have as an ambassadors for the brand!  We ended up going to the restaurant only because of them....how surprised were we when we showed up and Blythe was there! She personally came out and welcomed us (again) and told us about the menu selections, weekend brunch and introduced us to Chello.... WOW! The ambience of the restaurant is like stepping back in time with big band elegance and decor and personal attentive service unlike what you see today.  A hidden gem..... staff that is genuine and only wants you to have an exceptional culinary experience. Can't wait to go back and try the weekend brunch!  Huge shoutouts to our beautiful Romania server Dana and bartender Alex (also new to CLT)- we'll see you soon!   Thank you Vivace for the warm welcome - we look forward to making CLT home and becoming regulars! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch, it was $30 for a set menu that you can pick and choose your appetizer and main course. A lot of options! Unlimited mimosa it was great"}
{"text":"Fantastic upscale Italian eatery.  I recently stopped for lunch and ordered the Roasted Scallion Gnocchi.  It has jumbo lump crab, cherry tomatoes, grilled corn and lemon thyme...very light and refreshing for lunch.  Also, they have a gluten free menu with more options than most! My colleague ordered the braised short rib pasta off this menu and said it was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Just ate lunch. & was not crowded at all. Would have to try at night on a weekend to get a better feel.  Ate here a 2nd time in the evening with high expectations, none of which were met. Everyone in our party of 3 would have preferred a nice tasty burger like the one Samuel Jackson ate on Pulp Fiction.  I needed some Sprite to wash it down."}
{"text":"My first Zeta Alum outing was at Vivace for brunch. The brunch deal is pretty good here. So for about $30, you can get bottomless mimosas, an appetizer, and entree. It's definitely worth doing if you're wanting to drink. I didn't end up getting the deal because I wasn't sure what the vibe was but next time I will! I got the short rib hash... literally the best has I have ever had! The meat was so tender. Highly suggest getting it (can be included in the $30 deal). This is definitely a great brunch place to go with the girls if you want to get a little bit dressed up. Happy brunching!"}
{"text":"Love this place! You can come on a romantic date night or even just a casual night. One of my favorite places to sit is out on their patio because you get a great view of the Charlotte skyline. Light and modern American cuisine that never fails to please!"}
{"text":"Kinda a fail ... Very limited menu ... We went looking for a place open on a Sunday that would have some good sauce ... They only really had spaghetti and meatballs,  bolognese and ravioli. So if your looking for lasagna, forget it they don't even make it.  Nice atmosphere, beautiful decor, great waiter"}
{"text":"Horrible service--the general manager was condescending, rude, racist.   I made a reservation for 10 for my birthday for brunch. I spoke to a hostess THREE TIMES prior to the day of the brunch and even the day of to ensure everything was set to go. No one ever mentioned their \"policy\" of not seating people until all of the party was there.   When I arrived there were 4 of us and we were told we couldn't be seated until \"all or the majority of the party was there\". We said ok and waited for more of my party to get there.   After 6 of us were there I asked if we could be go ahead and be seated. They said no, they could sit us at a 6 top table if we wanted to be seated now, but they would only seat us at a 10 top (the number for the reservation) if all 10 of us were there.   My friend asked why they wouldn't have a table for 10 ready since we made a reservation and the manager let us know their policy. My friend said ok that doesn't make sense but it's your policy. The manager said loudly as she walked away \"I'm sorry you feel that way!\"  At this point 8 people in my party had arrived. The manager went upstairs to get the table ready and when he came back down to get us, my 9th person had arrived. I let him know and he rolled his eyes, sighed and said \"now I have to see if I can get a table for 9 together\". I let him know I didn't understand why this seemed to be a hassle for him since I had a RESERVATION so they should have already had a table RESERVED for 10. He explained that they were running a business and he was trying to accommodate me when in reality he \"could just cancel my reservation\" since we were late. He then began to lecture me about how if I showed up to a doctor appt late I would have my appt cancelled. At that point my friends and I decided to leave and take our business elsewhere.   Also interesting was how another party of white females was allowed to go upstairs to their table and sit down to \"set up\" even though their entire party had not arrived. The manager NEVER apologized to me after having 2 convos with me, yet apologized to my white friend who walked in last and never talked to him. Hmm...."}

{"text":"Finally made it to Vivace with the dinner group and had a wonderful experience.  First off, I love the atmosphere. The decor features huge orange-ish chandeliers, wooden panels on the wall above the kitchen, wine cabinets on the opposite wall from the front windows and comfortable seating.  They have a nice patio overlooking the Little Sugar Creek Greenway for when it gets warmer and a seating area for just enjoying a glass of wine and conversation.  Instead of having a large menu, Vivace's features a few selections that they do very well.  Our table started out with the meat and cheese plate for an appetizer which I have to say my favorite was the hot sopressata and the gorgonzola.   I also had the Lentil Zuppa which was a savory brothy soup which is a nice change from cream based soups found everywhere else.  The homemade sausage in the soup had a wonderful flavor and texture.  For my main course. I had the Smoked Chicken & Spinach Agnolotti which has some incredible flavors in a very flavorful cream sauce.  My tastebuds were going nuts with this that one of my table mates said I was purring.  This is definitely one of the best entrees I have had in ages.  The dessert menu looked great but I just didn't have the room.  Service from our server, Caroline, was exceptional.   Even though there's a bottle of water left on the table, she was constantly refilling your glasses, clearing off the table, refilling wine and beer glasses.    And they play great music here.  We heard a lot of Thievery Corporation during our meal."}
{"text":"Really GREAT food in a wonderful modern atmosphere.  Trendy, Big City feel, plenty of room, dining areas divided into rooms to create a more cozy feel.  Calamari was best we've had - mixed with fried red peppers and fried squash/zuchini.  Veal was super thin with just the right  tasting of their ravioli covered in a beefy sauce.  Lobster Ravioli was filled generously with a vodka sauce.  Orangecello drink was super flavorful.  Ending of Strawberry Tiramisu was just the right amount of sweet."}
{"text":"Went there with my wife on a Friday night.  We had made the reservations in advance, since we had heard that it gets busy over Fridays.  We reached around 8 and the place was filling up, so we were lucky to select the table of our liking.  Ambience and the decor is quite good, gets little noisy.  We opted to seat indoors, since it was humid outside. They took some time to take our order, but were patient enough to answer our queries about vegetarian options.  What we had: Bruschetta - Average Four cheese ravioli - Good Fried Gnocchi on side - Above average Wine - Don't remember the name, but they have quite a lot nice collection here  Overall it was a nice experience and would visit again..."}
{"text":"Couldn't remember great server's name but went back this eve.  Sweetie got us great table on lower terrace.  Server tonight was Crystal...new, but she's a keeper!  So nice & was honest about what she's tried & her thoughts.  Server on earlier review was Amber...great!  Jaime is house manager & he was friendly & interested in how we enjoyed our food & evening.  Gnocchi is delicious Salmon dish very good but bits of pancetta were like pickles-super vinegar-y...weird but it didn't ruin meal."}
{"text":"This is a great spot, service was awesome and great atmosphere.  Brush up on your italian, the menu can be a bit of a mystery...Lol.  I looked the goat cheese and the expresso, and the dessert oh lala"}
{"text":"So... we made our reservation significantly in advance via Open Table making note of an Anniversary and a gluten allergy for one guest. We heard positive feedback from friends about this restaurant. Therefore, expectations were elevated. It was a true disappointment just walking in the door. It is enjoyable to know a restaurant is in demand in a busy city on a Saturday night. There were no guests at the bar and it was only about 15-20% full.  We were 20 minutes early thinking we would enjoy a cocktail before dinner yet we were seated right away. A friend suggested a specific martini. We asked about it based on the liquor. Our server wasn't familiar and needed to retrieve a cocktail menu as we weren't given one. The beverages weren't served with the garnishes described by friends who dined at the eatery just the evening before. And the glasses were only a third full.  The wine list, while huge, has zero selections outside of Italian. I get it that we were at an Italian restaurant, but it seemed limiting. The server didn't seem knowledgeable about pouring the bottle we ordered. She fumbled and never offered the cork. Further, she wanted to rush us through our decisions.  On to our appetizer. We always enjoy mussels. This was prepared in a tomato broth. Sadly, the Roma tomatoes were huge making it very awkward to try them. Overall, while they weren't tough, yet there was very little flavor at all. When we asked the manager about the dish including the tomatoes, he got incredibly snotty.  We were offered a half glass of Prosecco and an offering from there upcoming fall menu to celebrate our Anniversary. While it looked great, I didn't eat it. Gluten allergy. Clearly stated when the reservation was made. I waited while a sub of Burata and tomatoes was brought. A tough exterior to the cheese and a serious lack of seasoning.  Entree. Husband's veal was enjoyable. My steak. Again lacking in seasoning. Spinach purée cold. Romesco had zero punch to it. Asked for another dish. Scallops with risotto. Scallops weren't cleaned properly- gritty. Risotto far too crunchy to be al dente.  When we asked to speak to the manager he was nothing short of a prima donna escalating his voice when we raised our concerns. This was truly our worst experience! Thankfully we have found other much better options in CLT. We will NOT return. I actually felt held hostage to some of the worst service with this treatment."}
{"text":"Such a neat restaurant! Love the decor & huge orange light fixtures. Food was excellent- spicy bean purée on garlic bread, seasonal salad with grapefruit & oranges, and the risotto di mare- one of the best I've ever had. The food service was a bit slow, we were in the restaurant for almost an hour and a half; but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Big fan. Very big fan of Vivace. The ambiance, the decor, the fantastic drinks and food, and the knowledgeable staff all make this one of our favorite places to dine in Charlotte.   Be sure to make reservations and then arrive a bit early and have a drink at the upstairs bar. There are doors that open up to a view of Uptown Charlotte when the weather permits, and it's just a gorgeous place to catch up with some friends over great drinks and appetizers. Speaking of food, here are a few of my favorites:  Appetizers: the calamari with spicy tomato aioli is very good, as is the meat & cheese plate. They also bring bread and white bean spread to the table as a starter, which is very good and can be quite filling.  Salad: the seasonal salad is always great as it has homemade dressing, and the caprese salad is a solid choice as the balsamic is very good.  Dinner: the margherita flatbread, smoked chicken and spinach stuffed agnolotti, and the chili-capellini and lump crab are all great choices. The agnolotti is my favorite go-to dish at this restaurant.  Desserts: honestly, the desserts are a bit small and not for sharing (think tea cake size), but are very delicious. You should definitely try the gelato if you have any room left after dinner.  There is valet parking if you can't find a spot in the deck, and a very large patio on the ground floor for sitting outside if you so choose. If you haven't yet, you should try out Vivace; you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"whoever listed this in Meyers Park is wrong....the neighborhood is considered Midtown.  the food is hit or miss....sometimes i've had amazing items, other times i've been disappointed.  obviously you cannot deny the view from upstairs.  and i do love their bottomless mimosas for brunch.  service is usually good."}
{"text":"We celebrated our first year anniversary of marriage at Vivace, and while the experience was intimate and upscale, the food was just average (albeit creative) and the service wasn't quite where it needed to be for the vibe and presentation. It wasn't necessarily a let down, but we didn't leave blown away.  In terms of ambience and style, I loved what Vivace offers. The restaurant isn't exactly Uptown but the view, particularly from the balcony, is stellar and peaceful. The inside is very modern and a bit romantic. We were given a very sexy corner in the loft upstairs that I adored.  Our waiter was decent. He knew the menu well and had great suggestions, but he was very relaxed and kind of slow. He seemed full of personality but lacked the polish that I like to see on a nice evening out.  The nitty gritty is the food, which counts the most. The chef sent us complimentary seared scallops with a compote of mixed unknown vegetation which was a very nice way to start our meal. Neither of us like scallops anywhere but felt compelled to eat them due to the gesture. For the first time ever, we both enjoyed the scallops. They had an awesome texture and weren't salty/fishy at all.   For the main course, I knew exactly what I wanted. The cider braised pork shank with cherries, cabbage, and some kind of mustard dumpling (but not a dumpling... Like small crispier bread bits). The pork was delicious, though a better shank comes to mind. I was disappointed in both cabbage (thick and red) and the dumpling things (soggy, rather flavorless) and had plenty of room after for dessert which never happens. Hubs ordered spaghetti and meatballs (way to step out of the box!) that he thought tasted like every other spaghetti and meatballs. He thought changing the meat mixture would enhance the dish greatly. I took a bit of the noodles and sauce only and thought it was really good and flavorful!   For dessert we both shared two unbelievably gargantuan scoops of gelato - one being a vanilla with chocolate swirls and the other a seasonal pumpkin. The vanilla/chocolate gelato was milky and unremarkable, the pumpkin was extraordinary and the best part of our entire meal. The latter is possibly the best gelato I've ever had.  Being an Italian restaurant, we were also pleased with the wine menu and enjoyed a recommendation that was special yet didn't go over our budget. This is a nice spot if you're looking for a romantic evening out but are trying to avoid a $50 per head cost."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited this spot recently, but while the view we enjoyed from our seat was great, the food wasn't.  I have definitely had better Italian, even in Charlotte.  I had a mushroom risotto, which was terribly bland.  And my husband's dish was so meh, he doesn't even remember what he ate.  We won't be visiting here again."}
{"text":"We went during restaurant week- some people did the $30 tasting menu - I opted out. We had everything from appetizers and wine all the way down to dessert and I was SUPER impressed.  Being a native New Yorker I have set the bar high for Italian food and I have to say this delivered!   I started off with amazing bread and a delicious Cabernet - next I moved on to one of THE BEST Caesar salads Ive ever had (fresh cheese, delicious croutons, creamy homemade dressing) ...next I had my entree where I enjoyed the homemade pasta (it was a smoked chicken and spinach stuffed agnolotti  = fabulous!!!!) ...then we split a few desserts - while not as memorable great none-the-less.  I will definitely go back- give it a shot if you are sick of the same 3 Italian restaurants in Charlotte !"}
{"text":"I'm really torn on how to write this review.....   I was so excited to find a place that has bottomless drinks and takes reservations.    We had a party of five and got there at 11:45 on Sunday.  We waited forever for our order to be taken.  Three of us got the vivace way and the other two just ordered drinks and food.  The drinks were slowly brought out, but my first course was brought out quickly.  It was a salad that was actually really good.    We all waited a really long time for drink refills, which was disappointing.  For the main course three of us ordered salmon.  One of them was cooked perfect and the other two were really burnt.  We had to send them back.  As a side note I haven't had to send food back at a restaurant in forever.    When they were brought back out one was under cooked and one had hair on it.  We kept the under cooked one and sent the one back with the hair in it.   We then ordered a dessert to share.  The dessert was really good, but when the waitress brought it out she winked at us and said it was for a birthday.   We asked for our checks multiple times with one more drink refill.  The poor waitress tried to get the manager and told us she wasn't sure what was going on with the kitchen and why we were having to wait so long.  The manager finally came over and told us he was taking care of the check.  The waitress then brought us our checks and we were all charged for our drinks and for the dessert.  It was very strange.  We all just paid the bill and left.    I don't think it was the waitress' fault for any of it, just seems like the kitchen can't handle the bottomless drinks with a full restaurant.     The environment is really nice and the views of the city are amazing.  I agree with the other Yelp reviews about the slow service."}
{"text":"Was tasked with finding a place to take out of town friends for brunch. The catch was not having an hour to wait to be seated. Made a reservation through OpenTable about an hour before and were seated as soon as we arrived. Would have liked to enjoy their lovely patio..but...July. Interior decor was beautiful, loved the chandeliers.   My manfriend and I both opted to do brunch \"The Vivace way\" -- $25 for an appetizer, entree and unlimited mimosas and bloody marys. A really good deal if you are going to have at least one drink. I was disappointed that they didn't have the bloody mary/mimosa bar out for Saturday brunch, but will have to come back on a Sunday to try.   Everyone was happy with their meal. I ordered the calamari for an appetizer and thought it was a little bland. My Benedict was good, but they overdid it on the hollandaise a little. The bread and ham they used were so delicious I would have liked to be able to taste them more! Rosemary potatoes were awesome. The shrimp and grits were really good as well. We also enjoyed the drinks. Bloody Marys simple yet delicious and I liked that they had pineapple juice for mimosas.   I took a dinner menu to look at and definitely want to come back for some pasta!"}
{"text":"Like some others, we jumped on the Living Social deal to Vivace.  I really have no idea why they threw that bone out there, as I am fairly sure they have no need of it, but since they did, we used it.  Definitely glad they did (and that we did).  The service at Vivace is second to none, as is the scenery, inside and out, though the layout of the interior is a bit odd - perhaps it is those massive red chandeliers from the bizarro Ikea world.  Or maybe it is all just a bit disjointed rather than having a nice flow to the place.  There is what I would call a dining room to the right (with a bar), a bar to the left (with bar tables, but no dining room), and another dining area upstairs (also with a bar).  The bar downstairs also has a patio and the dining area upstairs has a balcony.  Unfortunately, each time I have been there, it has been at least overcast outside, if not downright scary, making those outdoor spaces less than ideal.  Still, the heaters are nice - it just makes the view less than spectacular.  Not their fault, but it does impact the usability.  Which leaves the food.  We found it to be hit and miss.  Some items are average, like the meat and cheese platters.  Good, but not great.  Others, like the fish, have a nice crispy skin in one area, but the same skin is mush elsewhere.  Then you get a nice piece of meat, say the short rib, that is tasty, but man is it rich!  Had to stop after just a few bites.  Luckily it belonged to someone else - if it was mine, I would have been disappointed that I had to stop so quickly."}
{"text":"Trendy inside décor with a very nice outdoor patio.  The food is just OK, but the ambience makes it the perfect place to take a date."}
{"text":"First off the location has a fantastic view of the Charlotte skyline; recommend a table on the second floor!  Food was very good, flavorful, and unique. They have a extensive wine list and specialty drinks that were amazing. The menu had a decent variety and portion size was perfect...highly recommend the Chicken al Mattone!  Valet parking & reservations recommended; the staff is very friendly! Probably not a good place for young kids, but they can accommodate large groups."}
{"text":"Our favorite Italian restaurant in the area. Everything is house made. Even the deserts. I took my wife today for her birthday with 80+ yr old mother.  Our server Bryan took the utmost care to ensure we had a great experience, who is lead by a manager who really cares."}
{"text":"The place was super trendy, and I felt like I was dining in the heart of Manhattan. Vivace was a great spot to admire Charlotte's city lights, enjoy some tasty Italian treats, and create new memories. Read more about my experience here: http://www.ginapacelli.com/2015/04/17/north-carolina-vivace/"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant with outside seating and complimentary valet.  However the food was not up to par. We started with the bread it came with a dip that was tasteless n the waitress did not tell us what it was. The bruschetta was way to sweet. For dinner the risotto with scallops. The scallops were extremely salty. Even the tiramisu was not the norm, it had a gelatin like layer, layered throughout the cake."}
{"text":"This place was good, but not amazing. The service was very good, especially considering how busy the restaurant was. The food was just OK. It's pretty good, but not good enough that I would come back. That being said, this may have been partially due to the fact that we came during Queen's Feast, so the kitchen may have been overwhelmed. I'd come back and give them a second chance next time I'm in the area, because their menu was inventive and decor was excellent. I also thought, considering the crowd, our server was extremely effective."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying, we walked in 15 mins before close on a Sunday night. The servers were still very friendly and patient. We ordered the meat/cheese combo for an app that came w/ three great dipping sauces... Honey, apricot, and apple. We didn't like all of the meats and cheeses but it was fun to try different varieties of them.   As for the entres... very delicious!!  The only negative thing was the lighting was very dim for having such big light fixtures.   Highly recommend it, specifically for the value, ambience, quality, and new trendy location."}
{"text":"Definitely still a big fan of Vivace. It definitely is (still) one of the best looking restaurants in town with a sweet patio and *stunning* upstairs lounge area. If you're seeking a private party space you must check out that second floor.   Service is spot on and are happy to not only describe the dishes, but they go above and beyond detailing the wines on special, where they come from, what the grapes are like, etc. The menu changes up on occasion and I had the pleasure of trying their new-ish chili capellini with crab. While it sounds like an odd combo, it was tasty and light filled with a sizeable portion of pasta, fresh crab, tomatoes, spinach and a dose of fresh crab meat. And it was spicy! It a good way, of course.   For dessert a few girlfriends and I sampled the warm chocolate cake with nutella gelato (WINNER), the apple crostada (with cinammon gelato - delightful) and the mint chocolate chip gelato. Vivace is still one of my faves in the QC. Grazie!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to come for brunch. All of my friends have raved about. The food was decent but honestly the mushroom frittata was under seasoned. And by under seasoned I mean no seasoning. And the server was not attentive at all. He had two tables at the time and I waited over 20 min for a refill. I had opted for the unlimited mimosa option. I had received two mimosas within our entire time being there. By the end I was seriously just looking for my server to close out. Not worth paying the extra price for unlimited if your drink sits empty for half an hour. I get being busy but to be blatantly ignored was not ok. I took leftovers home and my family commented how poorly seasoned my food was. The salads though were great"}
{"text":"Started the night off with a drink from the bar and the bartender was great and the cocktail was delicious. We got to our table and the server wasn't very interested in us, didn't even mention his name. Service overall was very slow on his part, refilling glasses of water, clearing glasses and dishes from the table etc. I may be a little more harsh because of working in the industry in the past but it's the truth and in a nicer restaurant like us I had expected more. When our food came they placed it in front of us and zipped off. The next time he came back to check on us my meal was finished and it was mediocre. I ordered monkfish with the risotto and another friend at the table ordered the same dish. The presentation was very much half done and my dish was a lot more watery looking then her's. The taste was a 3 out of 5 of the risotto and the fish. The vegetable on top was undercooked and too hard to cut. No manager come by at all during the meal to check on the group. The company I kept was great, the interior of the restaurant is still beautiful but I think overall the caliber of this restaurant has gone down tremendously from when they first opened roughly 6-7 years ago, the first time I was visited. With all the other choices out there these days, I don't believe I will be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Was excited to try Vivace having read reviews. I had high hopes for this self proclaimed hip Italian.  However, we were greatly disappointed with our entire experience.  From the start our waiter was extremely rude and checked out.  The tuna crudo with melon was tough and tasteless. The veal was also tough, over seasoned, and basically inedible.  The grouper was swimming in burnt brown butter and the fried gnocchi resembled fried pasta paste and tasted flavorless. This was time ever that we asked for the bill and left the restaurant during the entree course! It was that bad! Vivace is hyped as a trendy, hip Italian but is truly lacking in everything including style."}
{"text":"Vivace is conveniently located off the greenway, within walking distance from Carolina Medical Center. My brother and I walked here to celebrate my birthday after visiting my mom in the ICU last month. There's lots of seating both indoor and outdoor and would be a nice place to eat outside and people watch when it's warm outside like nowadays.  It's wasn't a busy Wednesday night. Our server was good, giving us enough time to review the menu. We split the Brussel Sprouts Antipasti. The portions are generous even for the appetizers. I loved the mix of sweet and savory with the apples, pecans, and smoked pancetta. Maybe a little over dressed with the butter but otherwise my favorite dish of the night. I had the Pappardelle as my entree and it was good, standard fare. Pasta could be a bit more al dente. Again, good portion size so I had enough to take home for a second meal. Overall it was an a-okay meal with a nice and quiet ambiance."}
{"text":"small plates but i felt it was worth the bill. Wife and i split spagetti and meatballs soup and asparagus. Bill with drinks was 60 bucks. Good surroundings and view staff could of been better. Good meal all in all"}
{"text":"I appreciate the focus on italian wines and beers, a great detail.  The pizza good.  I have been twice and it was significantly better the first time.  I had steak both times, the second time it has much less wood-grilled flavor.  Grilled peaches were not good, muscles were decent.  I am not  crazy about the white bean dip they give you with the bread either and requested olive oil, which was a major improvement.  Usually the special is good.  Nice views, good ambiance.  Great for a group or a date (or pizza at the bar)."}
{"text":"I have to give Vivace 5 stars for a number of reasons:   1. Service is outstanding. Go here and you will be treated the way I wish EVERY restaurant in the world treated their customers-friendly and respectful staff, no snobbery either.   2. The food. Here are just a few of my favorites:   Mussels: If you are a mussel fan, get these. A large portion of mussels (none of this 10 dinky mussels in a dinky cereal bowl type of thing). The broth is excellent. Want extra bread for dipping (recommended)...no problem!   Cured Meat and Cheese board: You can select a variety of cheeses and meats for a yummy appetizer. The staff has never steered me wrong when asking for a recommendation.   Warm Bittersweet Chocolate Cake: I have come to Vivace solely for this dessert (after eating dinner elsewhere!). Be difficult like me, and ask for plain vanilla gelato, if they have it, in purist fashion.   I have tried a variety of their entrees, the salmon and duck particularly stand out. Oh- and their brunch options are delish, and will cure even the sickliest of hangovers, with class of course. Portions are very nicely sized. The atmosphere is lively, modern, but still relaxed and un-stuffy. Please go to Vivace, it will not be your last visit."}
{"text":"Awesome awesome brunch on Sundays. The food was incredible and so was our server Nina, she made the experience a 10/10! Great calamari!"}
{"text":"Went here for restaurant week with a big group and we had exceptional service - our waitress was attentive and funny.  The three course meal was big portions - I couldn't finish each course, but all were delicious.  I had the Brussel sprouts, fish and tiramisu.  The dessert was probably my favorite part!"}
{"text":"I recently came here with my boss for happy hour and have to admit, I was impressed!! The outdoor seating by the greenway makes for a pleasant seating area because you aren't sitting on the road, like many other restaurants in Charlotte. We ordered cocktails which were all great, I had a Mojito and mule. My boss ordered a drink that came in a tiny martini glass and was pink.  He wasn't too happy.  We also ordered the calamari and flatbread both which were great.  Customer service was good too - our server couldn't have been nicer and more accommodating. Also, plus with the complimentary valet.  Will be returning to explore the menu more."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Classy place with attention to detail. They have an expeditor who makes sure food is served in a timely manner and that the food looks and tastes wonderful. I had Bruschetta made with beautiful Heirloom Tomatos, Lump Crab Cappelini, garluc spinach and Lavender Panna Cotta. Every dish was great! The Cappelini had an amazing amount of crab meat, and the sauce was infused with tasty crab flavor. The pasta is house made and served perfectly Al Dente. Best italian food I've enjoyed in quite some time. Service was quick, friendly, and above the board professional. Great place for a romantic date."}
{"text":"Vivace is an awesome place to sit outside for both couples and groups! Super tasty discounted apps during the week. Service lately has been not so hot, but the rosé makes up for it. Great view of uptown and located right off the greenway. Recommended!"}
{"text":"I've been getting quite generous with my ratings as of late, but I feel like it's so well-deserved!  Maybe I'm dining out and getting lucky with some spots, or maybe I'm just in a general jovial mood.  Whatever it may be, let the good times roll.  First of all, the place has a modern feel, but still very classy.  It's a good balance of a nice solid sit-down first-date restaurant (maybe?) but also a great place to hang out in the bar and patio.    So given all the upside of the patio and bar (and probably the good-looking people that would frequent such a spot)... I came here for Saturday lunch when there wasn't any diners.  What?  I came after a round of golf, in full golf garb, to get a solid meal in--I wasn't disappointed.  I ordered the spaghetti.  Simple and classic to really gauge the cooking...if I wasn't completely blasted already for a round of golfing + day-drinking.  It hit the spot and I appreciated the portion size.  It wasn't too much where there's lots of leftover, but at the same time, it wasn't too little that left me wanting more.  Props to portion control.  Service complemented the food well.  One dude in our group doesn't eat meat, and ordered the sea scallops with risotto.  It came with prosciutto and the staff took it back promptly without a tinge of unhappiness.  It's a classy thing to do and was surprised at how well it was handled.  They don't get five stars for this, it's a reason that they have five stars--if that makes sense at all.  I'll gladly be a patron of this restaurant, and hopefully I can make it out here on one of the more popping nights... looks like a good scene...  dmo out."}
{"text":"We visited for brunch and the service was great, but the food took 90 minutes to come to the table! My friends and I went and all got the $30 brunch special. The mimosas were constantly being topped off, which is great, but I think its to distract from the fact that the bread took 30 minutes to come, appetizers took 45 minutes to come out and the main dishes took even longer. Everyone at my table ordered the quiche with side salads, so it really doesn't make any sense for it to take so long to cut a slice of egg pie and put greens on a plate.  The food was okay but we'll never come back. We could've eaten 3 meals in the time it took us to get one."}
{"text":"Let me start by expressing the build-up that was my expectation for this restaurant. I have been wanting to try Vivace since it opened its doors to the Charlotte public.   I heard great review after great review so the bar had been set pretty high. I elected to go during restaurant week so I can dip my toes into a few different dishes and not feel like my wallet was getting ambushed.   Overall thoughts? Awesomeness and I will absolutely be back. I had the risotto balls to start and they were heaven in my mouth. Perfectly cooked with a sauce to die for. Loved. I would have had them as my main meal as well if I could.   Then I opted for the steak. Eh. Just alright but definitely not bad. The sauce that came with the dish was finger-licking good but the steak was just a little under-cooked for my liking. My friend got the chicken capellini pasta and I thank my lucky stars she let me try some because holy goodness it was awesome. Unreal actually.  Dessert was perhaps my biggest area for concern because I went for tiramisu. My most favorite dessert of all time and I will judge a restaurant on its food quality based on the tiramisu that they serve. Vivace did not disappoint and actually got an extra star for serving it with a caramel sauce and Espresso gelato. Absolute deliciousness.   My overall thoughts? Get yourself to Vivace. STAT."}
{"text":"Friday night (7/22/2016) was my 3rd time to Vivace. My 1st 2 experiences were great with no complaints, however, this time extremely disappointed me. I want to write off the sub-par food to it being Restaurant Week and it being busy because of the event. I took my husband there because I raved about the food at brunch, and it seems like everything crumbled for him. Our appetizers were delicious (I had the caprese salad and he had the cheese tray). However, our main entrees left a lot to be desired. I had the lobster ravioli which came out barely on the verge of warm, and the raviolis were hard around the edges. My husband ordered the steak with potatoes medium-rare, and it came out to the table cold to the touch, and RED rare. The dish also came with a huge roasted bone for the marrow, which looked like a nasty chewed up dog bone (so un-appetizing). When my husband sent the steak back to be cooked closer to medium-rare, our waitress dropped the bone on the floor, which splattered everywhere, and no-one came to clean it up the entire rest of our visit (other guests and servers were walking through it). When the dish came back, the steak was barely warm and still red. At this point, I had finished my dish, and my husband decided to eat some of his. After a few bites, it just wasn't appetizing to him, and the consistency of the meat was almost like pot roast. Thankfully, our desserts were much better (he had the black and white tiramisu and I had the watermelon sorbet). Overall, the best part of the night was the view we had from upstairs. Brunch is highly recommended from here, but this time around, I wouldn't recommend this place for Restaurant Week dinner."}
{"text":"Vivace has now surpassed Lumiere as our favorite restaurant in Charlotte.  We recently visited them twice for New Year's Eve and January's Restaurant Week, having not been here in almost a year.  I'm not sure why we waited so long to return, but we definitely won't wait that long to return.    Everything was on point.  The New Year's menu was delicious, but I'll focus on Restaurant Week, as we could choose anything on the menu.  We started with the carne and formaggio tray and smoked trout burrata.  My husband really loved his meat and cheese tray, including the pickled veggies.  My burrata was fresh, and the trout was delicious.  The portions were perfect.  For our entrees, my husband had the Zuppa de Pesce, and I had the scallops.  The Zuppa had a rich broth, and was full of seafood.  My scallops were the best preparation of scallops I've EVER had.  They were served with kale and a celery root/truffle purée that was divine.  I'm salivating just thinking of that puree.  There was enough to have some with every scallop bite, and it really added to the flavor of this dish.    For our desserts, my husband had their gelato, and I had the mint chocolate tiramisu.  The gelato was thicker and richer than I've had before, and really good.  We took my tiramisu home, and enjoyed it over the next couple of days.    Service at Vivace is nothing less than stellar.  And we prefer sitting upstairs, where the seating is more intimate, and the views are spectacular.    All in all, you can't go wrong with Vivace!"}
{"text":"Server was really rude, didn't not bring bread to the table, never asked for reorders of drinks, never checked to see if the food was ok and had an attitude when I confronted him regarding the lack of service and quality.  Food was ok, fish was salty and the broccolini was really bitter and inedible.  The pizza was just bad with nothing but cheese and no flavor.    Pick any other place but this for any occasion."}
{"text":"The brunch is awesome. I've only been there once, and that was for late brunch so can't say how their dinner or bar side is. First, brunch doesn't end at 1pm or even 2pm. Vivace - whether you pronounce it vi-va-chi or vi-va-che - has your favorite Sunday brunch until 3pm. That's pretty cool. Especially because I went there around 2pm feeling a ton like having toast and eggs.  We didn't exactly get off on the right foot. They made me and my wife wait for somewhere around 15 minutes. It was 2pm on a Sunday afternoon, and you could see that it's not jam packed in there - or outside. But I did see that they were working on it so I didn't say anything (although my voice became a bit of a megaphone towards the end when I said, \"are you guys ready?!\").  In any case, I had the Benedicto Vivace. On point. Right on, guys! Great job with the fries and the eggs! Really, I didn't expect it to be sooo good but it was. The egg was just right with perfect color and texture. The fries were not greasy or burned but had the right degree of crispness (?). Oh, and the lemonade that I ordered to go with it killed it. Man, did I enjoy my third meal of that day. (Yes, I had breakfast and lunch before that. But...)  So there you go. And tonight, fellow Yelpers and I shall check out how it's like there at night! So stay tuned!"}
{"text":"It was our first visit to Vivace. We sat outside on the wonderful patio. Great views of the Greenway and Uptown skyline. Our meal was very good! Delicious calamari (huge portion, enough to take home) and a good caprese salad. We both had pasta for our mains that were also good.  Overall the atmosphere was more remarkable than the meal, but we will go again for sure."}
{"text":"This place is really great!!  Hubs took me here this past weekend for my birthday.  We had a nice little booth on the second level with a great view of Uptown! Our server was excellent and VERY helpful when it came to selecting wines and food pairings.     The food was really good.  I had the Trout stuffed with Shrimp and it came out hot and fresh.  It was devine!  Flavor was amazing and presentation was excellent.  My hubs enjoyed his smoked chicken with spinach dish as well.  For appetizers we had calamari (which was a nice generous portion size) and bruschetta.  I didn't care for the bruschetta.  It was a little different than what I'm used to.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either.  Just ....different.  :) Def give it a go...you might like it!  We absolutely loved the atmosphere,  and the decor of the place.  We even took pictures of the walls and decor to use as inspiration for our own house!  Loved it!  I would defiantly say this is a place we would return too again.  Great for a mid size group or a romantic evening with your main squeeze.  :-)"}
{"text":"My friend had her rehearsal brunch in the upstairs area and it was so nice! There was a pre set menu but the drink menu was huge! I got a Caesar salad (the Parmesan was amazing) and the ravioli was really good. They make their dough in house and the sauce was the perfect combination of sweet and spicy! Honestly the best ravioli I've ever had! I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Great place for Sunday Brunch! Nice sociable atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Service is always a little off here. From neglectful to just weird. The bartender was telling me a story about how he liked to wrestle dogs to the ground. Which ruined my appetite because I didn't feel like talking for hours to him anyway. Sangria is good, meat board is good, meatballs are good. Otherwise overpriced."}
{"text":"Ate hear for restaurant week. It was pretty good. The service was good, but there was a party downstairs and they were kind of loud. Outside of that my dinner was good. We didn't get seated right away even though we were there on time (they were turning over from brunch). Outside of that I'd recommend this restaurant. I think I'd be a good place to have drinks or at least brunch on a Sunday morning."}
{"text":"This restaurant was an instant favorite of mine. From the moment you walk in the door you know that this is not your ordinary run of the mill Italian restaurant. The decor is modern and crisp and the staff greet you right away - a mere hint to the type of food experience that awaits.   Unlike everywhere else I have have had Italian food in Charlotte, you can order even the heaviest of items from the menu and you will find that they have somehow been transformed into lighter crisper/fresher dishes. The flavors may become more delicate and modern as a result of Vivace' take on Italian cuisine but you should know that nothing is lost in translation.   I have been to Vivace multiple times and I have always had a great experience all around. The service is snappy and the food is good."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere. This place is great for a date night, brunch with friends, or private dinning. I went for brunch. They have a $30 two course meal with bottomless mimosa. I had calamari and the lobster bisque. Both were amazing!! Everyone's food was delicious. The mimosas were great too! Service was great! I definitely will be back."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Vivace and everyone in my party agreed that this place is overrated. While I rated it 3 stars, \"meh, I've experienced better\" is more accurate. Two just seems too low, as there was nothing wrong here. I give the service a 10/10 and the food a 6/10. I had my niece, who is 18 months, with me and they went above and beyond to accommodate everything that I asked for. Kudos to the valet and staff.  My waitress said that the scallops with risotto would come with 4 scallops. There were three, which actually would have influenced what I ordered had she been accurate. Additionally, I thought that the dish was a little bitter and lacking in texture and character. Scallops have to be surrounded by something with pizzazz and the risotto simply missed the mark. One of my friends had a pork chop with salad on top. I'm sure that the name is far more fancy and Italian, but that's what it was. It was huge and she enjoyed it, but again said it was nothing to write home about. I'll give this place another try. I've heard the happy hour menu is tasty."}
{"text":"I came here on a Wednesday night and wow...it was glorious! You step into the building and you no longer feel like you're in Charlotte! The decor is fantastic and the service was spot on. I ordered the soup of the day which was a delicious cauliflower and broccoli purée with cream and prosciutto. Omg! I could have eaten just that, however, I also had the parpadelle bolognese. I ordered the appetizer portion and it was still pretty massive. I only managed to eat half of it, but the goat cheese on top made it divine! My friends enjoyed their pizza and steak as well. Oh, and the calamari was pretty good as well. It could have used some lemon for acidity but it was yummy nonetheless. I will absolutely return!"}
{"text":"Had been here before restaurant week and liked it. Came here on restaurant week...and they rocked it!!! Service was great....they were very busy and crazy...but still provided knowledgable, friendly service. Burrata was amazing...hope they add this to the regular menu. Our cocktails were amazing...our waiter, wish I could remember his name, made us a specialty cocktail with our two favorite cocktails mixed! Great time!"}
{"text":"Modern Italian and DELISH!  Great spot to meet up with friends for drinks and dinner.  I had my birthday dinner there and the service was great.  The four cheese ravioli is outstanding, you can add chicken or shrimp to it.  The Beef Arugula & Parmesan App was a greater starter along with the bread."}
{"text":"Pros: Valet Great brunch spot Quick seating Decent menu   Con: Although our waitress was pleasant enough, the hostess was rude and stuffy    I think the time I went was just an off day. We went for brunch on a Sunday. The woman told us there was only seating outside, even though there was only one table being used inside. Their brunch deal is great! All you can drink mimosas or bloody Mary's with an app and an entree for $30. The coffee was horrible! It tasted like water. I sent it back and she didn't charge me, which was nice. The menu isn't large, but has enough options. Our food was really good. I might try it again. I've heard great things, so I'm wondering if we went on an off day."}
{"text":"Brunch is amazing! Your choose of appetizer and entree with unlimited Mimosa and Bloody Mary Bar! $25"}
{"text":"So we decided to try this restaurant out during restaurant week with two other couples. When you first arrived they have free valet parking which is always nice (especially in the heat of the summer). When you walk into the restaurant it has a large floor plan with two different levels and two different outside patios. We were seated upstairs which was a nice smaller area with its own private bar.  Overall I was very impressed with the layout in the design of the restaurant.   The food, all the food that I happen to order was pretty good overall. I wasn't blown away by anything though. I'm not going to hold that against the restaurant because all the other people I was with thoroughly enjoyed their meal. And it may have just been my failure to order what my taste buds were craving.  The waitstaff was very organized and professional, when there was an issue they took care of it right away and apologized.   In the end, my overall experience at the restaurant is worthy of five stars. they did a great job and the food was very good I would recommend it and return."}
{"text":"Excellent brunch! The Bloody Mary bar is a brilliant idea and the mimosas are to die for. I had the meatballs, bruschetta and the burger.. All delicious."}
{"text":"2 stars is me being nice. This place has gone to shit. The food was pre-prepared, and cold. The service was horrendous. I used to come here quite often, and I will NEVER be back."}
{"text":"Great setting for a lunch or dinner date. Food was GREAT and tasted as if made from scratch. The customer service was to match as our server Everett was vert helpful. I'm def taking my lady again (getting a beer this time)."}
{"text":"Where do I start with the horrible and unorganized service that was given to us on a Sunday brunch. The people honestly felt like they either were lost in space or just flat out didn't like their job.   I didn't even want to get food because I knew it was going to take over an hour. I order a drink and they told they didn't have it and I was just like you should know what you carry and don't carry anymore or update your menus.   Granted that's not as big of a deal as the fact of the TERRIBLE customer service here! Maybe dinner is better but forget about their brunch and go somewhere else like Dandelion as they have the BEST GRITS. Will not be rushing to brunch or a dinner at Vivace any time soon if I'm going to be treated as a second class citizen."}
{"text":"We had the pleasure this week of visiting Vivace during Restaurant Week.  Restaurant Week dining can be hit or miss in some places, as the huge volume of business can show the cracks in one's service planning, but the staff at Vivace are on the ball!  3 courses for $30?  They up the ante to 4 courses--5 if you count the amuse bouche.  Before we even ordered, we were brought little plates of corvina ceviche, which were fresh and bright.  We were seated in the upper dining area near the bar, which is a little less formal than the main floor, and affords a very nice view of Uptown.  I think this place could be a little loud, but being up there helped immensely with making conversation without shouting possible.   Our waitress happily explained the items on the menu we weren't able to translate ourselves (I know now ceci means chickpea in Italian!) and then we were off to the races.  My husband had the watermelon and balsamic appetizer, the flavors of which he said were \"unexpected\" but very good in combination.  I snacked on the aforementioned fried chickpeas which had a very nice spice on them--maybe harissa?  Something Mediterranean, but not your traditional Italian garlic and basil.  Spicy and flavorful, and fun as finger food!  Then came the first course, which at our table meant bruschetta with fresh peaches and basil (mmmmm, toasty!), and sweet corn agnolotti.  Oh, the agnolotti!  Little pillows of thin pasta bursting with a filling of creamy mascarpone and darkly sweet carmelized onions, coated in a sauce of fresh sweet corn and butter.  I will now forever dream of these when I think of good pasta.  They might make it onto my Death Row Meal list.  Outstanding!    Next up, entrees.  I had the fish, a corvina in aqua pazza with fresh tomatoes and cucumbers.  This is a very meaty fish, and the fresh veggies made for a light and satisfying meal.  However, I cast several longing glances at my husband's hanger steak and potato croquette.  Okay, I admit it, I am a bite-stealer.  Protect your food!  That potato thingy was amazing!  Crispy and crunchy on the outside, meltingly fluffy potato mash on the inside.  This kitchen staff knows what it is doing with a steak, too!    Lastly dessert.  Ah, dessert.  For me, tiramisu, for Mr. L, the lemon panna cotta.  Both very satisfying, both creamy, but light years apart in their vision of dessert.  The tiramisu was sweet, creamy and rich, the panna cotta was thick and light, with a little astringency from the blueberries.  In all, a perfect ending that suited both our dessert palates.    Will we go back during a normal dining week?  Oh yes!  There is a charcuterie plate we saw go by that I must try, and I am sure their grilled pizzas are a wonder of bread and cheese engineering, and, well, everything on their menu looks like it is well thought out and carefully constructed.  What a pleasure!"}
{"text":"Went on Father's Day for Brunch and had The Vivace Way - delicious!! The Roasted Strawberry Parfait & Panettone French Toast were spectacular. Very light, yet filling. Can't wait to go back to try more options."}
{"text":"**Gem Alert**  I have found another rare delight in Charlotte. This restaurant is right outside of Uptown but worth the travel. It begins with a perfect ambiance that is extremely complimentary to an all around delightful dining experience. You are able to bring your own bottle of wine and that truly helps keep your check in check. They prepare all the pasta on site and it is deliciously fresh. We started off with the mussels appetizer and we couldn't get enough. So many mussels!! And the sauce is the kind that you need to soak up every last drop with the bread. Which we did! For my entrée, I order the Smoked Chicken and Spinach Stuffed Angolini.. MMMMMmmmmmmmmm (see picture).. It was superb. My wife ordered some shrimp and pasta dish that I didn't try because my face was glued to my plate (See 2nd pic). I wish I went a little slower and enjoyed it more, but that is what the second trip is for. Right? I obviously recommend this restaurant and suggest you put it high on your list of places to try in the area.  Helpful Facts:  * Free valet parking * Great bar are if you have to wait * Huge wine selection if you don't want to byob/byow * Excellent service and knowledgeable staff  Enjoy!  -Ian M."}
{"text":"Blythe Bayrd has to be, hands down, the most amazing server and bartender in Charlotte. The food, service and professionalism is amazing. I always look forward to having an amazing brunch at Vivace. Josh Grogan was very nice and came by to check in and ensure my party was having a great experience. Brunch is only done well in one spot in Charlotte, Vivace"}
{"text":"Blythe and her team BY FAR are the most courteous and attentive staff I've been around. The brunch is the best value! Blythe helped me plan the most amazing work party/brunch and my co workers and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Been sat here since 8:30 - 10:15 now - still not even an appetiser in sight! Absolutely terrible service! A birthday dinner should not start off this way! STAY CLEAR- just awful"}
{"text":"Pizza was OK wasn't a real fan of the goat cheese in the pizza.  The spaghetti with meatballs was great... pasta cooked al-dente just like fine Italian pasta should be cooked, and their gelattos flavors were great... really liked the cinnamon one.  Cheese and meat platter yum!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Well priced. Make sure to sit in scott's section. EXCELLENT SERVICE! :)"}
{"text":"Finally, another brunch option!   My boyfriend and I have honestly been underwhelmed with the brunch options in Charlotte. I had company in town the other weekend and decided to give Vivace a try. I am glad we did.   They have a lovely patio with a view of the city, which is perfect for brunch. We made reservations, so we were seated right away.   I loved that they had the Vivace Way- an appetizer, entree, and unlimited mimosas or bloody marys for $25! It is a great deal, and they allow you to switch back and forth between the bloody mary and the mimosa. I figured they would be small portions due to the price, but we all left stuffed! We all shared a little bit of everything, and we were all impressed with our dishes.   Highlights for me were the meatballs, the pork belly hash, and the quiche. Everything was yummy though and I felt as though I got my money's worth.   I will say this seems to be a trend for Vivace reviews, but I would've given this place 5 stars if we had had better service. I hope they start to take the reviews seriously and improve upon this. Our service was mediocre, and if it was better this would've enhanced the experience."}
{"text":"Consistently good food (recommend caprese salad and pizzas -- fig & prosciutto and margherita). I love meeting friends up at Vivace to enjoy the outdoor seating & couches on a warm casual evening. I also love the upstairs balcony --the views are spectacular!  Vivace has a nice happy hour but doesn't disappoint for dinner either. Great space, vibe and overall experience."}
{"text":"This my second time to this lovely establishment. The staff was very friendly and attentive and great perfect view of the city."}
{"text":"This place had a nice vibe to it.  It was located in a nice area, and the atmosphere was nice.  The environment was nice and modern, but I'm not that much of a fan of it.  I really just liked the orange lamps.    I was not a big fan of the menu.  I really did not know what I was ordering.    I just did not get much details from the menu.  I did enjoy my  chili-capellini & lump crab though.  I thought it was delicious with  a little kick of spice."}
{"text":"Best gnocchi and mushrooms I have EVER had.    In my opinion:  Service was average.   Pizza, which I do not eat often, was not my favorite.   Will be back for ambiance and food. Just need to know what to order."}
{"text":"I recently attended an event in their private upstairs dining space. This space is FANTASTIC for private events, small receptions, or even (hint, hint), holiday functions! It has a private and fully-stocked bar, a large space that can be appointed to seat a fair number of guests (or, set up for over 100 if you do hors d'oeuvres (lighter food far, antipasto, appetizers...). Additionally, there is a beautiful (really nice!) private terrace/balcony up there. I was able to meet the event manager David, and he was delightful. I'll try to remember to upload a picture of his card. He was very bright-eyed-and-bushy-tailed, and super friendly.   The way they do events is quite simple, and reasonable... you don't have to pay a deposit, instead, you simply sign a contract committing to rent the space, and have a minimum to spend on food/bev. So if you want to have a sit down dinner with x guests, he'll just work with you and say we just need you to spend at least $x on food and beverage. I'll add, this is exactly how we've done it at Ruth's Chris and other CLT establishments for my holiday parties. You also have the option of setting a specific menu, going a la cart, or, picking what apps/etc you want set out or passed. They'll work with you.   Also, they have complimentary valet (don't forget to tip!). This is a MUST for any restaurant in Charlotte. While there is a free and close parking deck, I prefer the convenience of pulling up and letting someone else worry about finding a spot. :) Plus, (random factoid), they're next to Trader Joes - so you can stock up on that oh-so-delicious Cookie Butter. Dang it, now I want Cookie Butter. I digress...  The particular event I went to only had hors d'oeuvres, which simply means I didn't get a chance to try their entrees or pastas (which I would have liked to try). Oh well, it gives me a goal next time I'm there. So what did I try? I first had what the waiter said was blue cheese stuffed fig. Errr... I like fig, and I love blue (or any kind of funky-) cheese, but I was not a fan of this. But, don't let that discourage you because many of my fellow guests did seem to enjoy it. For me, the ratio of bold cheese (really bold!) to fig was off. Dare I say, too much cheese? GASP! I said it... oh well. (Though, really, you can't ever have too much cheese... or bacon.) Darn, I'm off track again.   Ok... where was I? Oh yes, hors d'oeuvres. They had oodles of olives (that's fun to say... try saying it 10 times fast!). The olives were fresh, flavorful and diverse. Yum! They also had blue cheese stuffed olives, which I enjoyed! Of course, you have to appreciate both olives and blue cheese - if you do, this would be a treat. We had a huge antipasto platter to pull from. It had an olive spread (almost like a tapenade meets hummus), which was good on their pita-breads. They had an assortment of quality meats (spicy and yummy salami and pepperoni), and even better quality cheeses on the platter. Now, the show stopper for the night was the cheesy fried risotto balls. Let me be clear, if you dine here (event of not), you MUST ORDER THESE! Delicious and perfectly balanced. They went very quickly, and despite the lovely staff hustling to refill them, they would run out many times before the platter made it to the table. That good!  Lastly, I cannot forget to comment on the drinks. They had VERY STIFF drinks (read: strong). This I actually think is an upsell... I had trouble drinking my mixed drink, but generally, when I pay the market rate for a mixed drink, I want value in the booze-to-mix ratio. This place has it down! Of course, they have a great assortment of wine and beer as well.  So, while I can't comment on the traditional dining service, or the heavier entrees, I do recommend Vivace based on my experiences here. Great location, easy to get to, valet parking, and quality ingredients in a modern-but-sleek restaurant."}
{"text":"Was at Vivace about a year ago, and was such a wonderful experience - I gave it five stars.  Been a while, and celebrating a birthday, we decided to go to Vivace for brunch.  We called to make a reservation, and indicated we would like to sit outside -- this seems to cause a lot of confusion.  We were told they don't reserve the tables outside -  we indicate we are on our way, and should be there in about fifteen minutes.  I've said it before, the Host/Hostess is the first impression for any restaurant.  The host we had today, should not be in that role.  We arrive and ask for a table for two, and would like to be outside.  They ask if we have a reservation, and I go to explain we called and were told they don't reserve the outside tables.  I was now under the impression they don't have any tables as the host stated we could sit at the couch area with coffee tables.  I state we'd just rather wait for a table-now there seems to be a table and immediately seats us.  The host sits us by the door, and I hate sitting by the door, and asked if we could sit at a different table, as there were plenty open tables.  He responds, NO, those tables are reserved, and had a smirk!  This made my blood boil. I just wanted to leave, but I go to ask for a manager.  After going in to ask for a manager others at the restaurant intercept and correct the table situation  -- now it's no problem to sit at another table?  This pretty much set the pace and mood for the rest of the brunch.  It was embarrassing, and my brunch was not as enjoyable as it could have been, I was actually a wreck - we were really looking forward to a repeat of the first visit.  Today, I ordered the Chicken and Biscuits, and they were very good - the dish wasn't very hot, but warm - the flavors were good.  My companion had the Eggs Benedict, and her food wasn't hot, even warm to say the least.  At this point, I asked not say anything more, as I've already made enough fuss over the table. Others at the restaurant apologized for our experience and stated the host was new.  He shouldn't be a host without proper training - dealing with the customer, again first impression.  This could have been handled so much better.  I was very adamant I didn't want him taking care of our table, and guess who brings our food out.    Quite honestly, not sure if I want to go back - certainly not for brunch, as we have many other places that we enjoy - better overall experience.  Even more disappointing, is no one from the restaurant ever reached out to discuss--they must not care"}
{"text":"Sooo Vicace brunch used to my go to spot but now I'm not so sure. The experience started off unfortunate after we had to repeat our order 3 times and went 26 minutes without drinks. In fact our food came before we got our drinks. I got the frittata and it was more of a block of cheese looking egg jello that was not ok (see pic). The waitress acted like she didn't care and said oh yea...we changed it. Thanks would have been helpful to know the frittata was no longer a frittata. We also ordered the thyme ricotta squash bruschetta and instead received plain toast with olive oil and tomatoes. Confused I asked the server if I could see the menu.  Did I order the wrong thing? I was told that they also changed it last minute and probably should have told me. I am not picky so while I was annoyed I ate it and moved on. Buuuttt then our server was gone.  25min went by and I never saw her. I asked another server if I could get a drink refill and was told I had to ask my server. Needless to say I got it another 10min later with my check."}
{"text":"Amazing decor and has a great wine selection too ! We started with the fried calamari and a pitcher of Sangria. I had the steak panini and my girl tried the chicken pesto panini we both love it :)"}
{"text":"I ate at Vivace's a few months ago, and loved their duck lasagna. This year, I thought it'd be the perfect place to celebrate my birthday. I was so excited, and had planned a dinner with my friends months ago. Sadly, it was a terrible experience, and I will never go back.   The food was HORRENDOUS. I was SO disappointed by the choices. I had my eyes set on veal with ravioli, only to be told by the waiter that it had prosciutto (ham) in it, and I'm not allowed any pork. I also couldn't have it made without any. Seriously???   I decided to just order ravioli and calamari (I love calamari!). Well, the calamari was tiny, cold, and very peppery. It took about 45-50 mins for the food the be brought out, which would have been okay, had the wait been worth it. The ravioli tasted, I kid you not, just like the frozen stuff I get at the grocery store. It was smothered in thick lumps of mozzarella cheese that got stuck in my throat.    By this point I was just so upset, because I was really looking forward to indulge on my birthday. The waiter told me she would bring some pasta instead. It took another thirty minutes for the pasta to come, and in the mean time my friends had already finished their meals. By this point I had no desire to eat my dinner while my party was finished with theirs and ready to leave.   My appetite was gone, and I just wanted to leave. My birthday dinner, which I thought would be so special, was ruined. Just a little bit of effort on Vivace's part would have made the world of difference.   The menu was scarce, and the only two options are either something with pork, or completely vegetarian. I was very disappointed, and my birthday dinner was ruined.   I will NEVER go back to this place. I'd much rather go somewhere where they put a little more love and care into what they serve to their customers."}
{"text":"I came here before for dinner and they are very gluten free friendly! They had really great pasta and it actually tasted like it was freshly made (GF) which I was very impressed with and still want to know if it was made fresh...  I recently came back for brunch and they accommodated a huge group of us and the service was still attentive."}
{"text":"I was disappointed by my visit this evening. We were sat 30 min after our initial reservation and had to ask for water, 15 minutes after being seated. The food was average and after waiting over 15 minutes for a second glass of wine, I was charged for a more expensive wine than I ordered. I was really looking forward to great service based on previous reviews but left less than satisfied."}
{"text":"I gave Vivace another shot this past weekend and I am glad I did....  I'm glad I came with a group this time because I was able to sample quite a few different items and we started with a couple of their appetizers which were very good.  We tried the bruchetta, grilled artichoke and the calamari....the bruchetta won the competition and may even be one of the best I've had in town.  The grilled artichoke was a little dry and flavorless but the calamari was on point.  Between the 8 of us we tried quite a few pasta dishes from the very basic spaghetti and meatballs to the homemade cavatelli in a sweet potato cream sauce to their Bolognese that had a goat cheese cream sauce...everything was wonderful!!  I like that they offer full or half portions because the pasta was definitely heavy so the smaller portion was just enough!!  The service was good for the most part...the hostess crew seemed a little dazed and confused but unfortunately that isn't totally abnormal.  They called to confirm my reservation and I told them it went from 10 guests to 8, when I arrived they had me down for a party of 10 and the table was set for 10, yet when other members of the party started to show up they were told there is no party listed under my name...whatever!!  The waitress was lovely and the service the rest of the night was great so that's all that matters.  The food is not what I would classify as Italian...I would say it is Italian-fusion but there is not much about this restaurant that is traditional...I think grandma and grandpa macaluso would be insulted that we call this Italian!  However, they do serve pasta and fish so that has to count for something!    The wine list is pretty diverse and affordable and the menu has something for everyone so that is a huge plus as well.  As so many have mentioned, the atmosphere is beautiful, sleek, trendy and modern.  The view of the city from the balcony is lovely...overall a great experience."}
{"text":"Loved it.  Here's why:  -first timer, the chef sampled us a mini plate...shrimp and grits BRAVO -tasty non-alch lemon pineapple refresher -ambiance -service (he knew the menu, was nice and HOT) -nice and cool inside to save this cali girl from the humidity -loved the grilled 'chokes with chipotle sauce -OMG the desserts....we tasted 3---all delish!  fave was the italian take on tres leches!   ---only thing i wasnt too crazy about was my entree.  boar ravioli.  seemed too al dente  (tough) to me  I will certainly return when I can."}
{"text":"My first time at Vivace for my husbands birthday dinner. We were in the private dining area which was really nice and cozy. The appetizers, cocktails, dinners and deserts were fantastic!  The staff made it a memorable night, we will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a unique, modern, open style to it, that I love. The drinks were great and the food was too! From the white bean dip, pizza, to the meatballs and pasta, a nice treat in the Metropolitan shopping center."}
{"text":"I had a great time. I went for my first time yesterday for brunch. For 30 dollars, you get an appetizer, an entree, and bottomless mimosas or blood Mary's. it was great. I got the Brussels sprouts (made with bacon and potatoes) and the crispy chicken sandwich. Great. The chicken DID need a little more seasoning but overall, it was really good. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Vivace is a good Italian restaurant with a modern twist we enjoy going to this place. The food is good as well as the service. Really nice Decor with great views of the city skyline. one of our favorite places"}
{"text":"I used to love this restaurant and was excited to reserve a table for New Year's eve. We ordered sparkling water, as suggested by the server but she returned shortly to tell us that they ran out of the sparkling water. The restaurant planned a special menu for the celebration for $65pp, but the server informed us right away that they ran out of fish. My boyfriend wanted to have fish but we said ok, let's do lamb. The server takes the order and then returns to us and tells us that they ran out of lamb as well.... We were not going to let that spoil our celebration so we ordered whatever was available and waited for the countdown... When I mentioned the countdown to our server, she smirked at us and said \"there is no countdown and the restaurant is closing.\" They closed the restaurant closed at 11:50 pm - 10 minutes before New Year's - turned on all lights, turned off music, started sweeping floors. A couple sitting next to us was also not happy about how the restaurant spoiled the celebration and they turned on music on their phone and we all continued meeting the New Year's and making the best out of the situation. They also told me that they came to this restaurant every year for New Year's celebration and it was never like this, there was always a countdown, music, champagne.... Not sure what happened to the management but this time is was obviously not executed very well. If f this was any night of the year, I would not be so upset but this was our first New Year's together and there will never be another chance to have a first New Year's ever again."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go enjoy a drink or have a nice meal. The food here is top notch and service is great. They also have a great wine selection. The restaurant has very cool modern decor & is definitely the ideal spot for a date!"}
{"text":"The BEST brunch in Charlotte.  You can't beat the price or the food.  Plus unlimited Bloody Marys or Mimosas.  Food is excellent and I have enjoyed our servers each time.  Do yourself a favor and try the Brussel sprouts...amazing, as well as the gnocchis.  Yum!!"}
{"text":"My first experience at Vivace was divine.  The atmosphere was fantastic and the food was every better.  Our selections included the the Steamed P.E.I mussels (good), a Caesar Salad (nice), Scallop Risotto (I am a fan!), and mint chocolate Gelato O Sorbetto for dessert (fabulous).  We brought in our own bottle of wine (superb) and paid a $10 corking fee.  My strongest advice is to make reservations otherwise, you will have to wait.  We had an early dinner @ 6:15 so that we could attend the Kirk Whalum concert (nice).  The only drawback was that we were seated near the register used by the wait staff so they tended to congregate in that area.  Check out my photos."}
{"text":"Brunch alert!  Get your mid morning appetite ready.  Recently went to Vivace for the first time after a Yelp private event. Was excited to sit down and enjoy a full on meal after seeing the ambiance and decor of the inside of the place. I'll be honest, the parking situation at the Metropolitan had kept me away for so long. However, they have valet so can't even look at that as a negative.   Decor, food taste and selection as well as service for the price point. This was truly a 5-star brunch!  We arrived a few minutes early and took a seat near the spacious bar. Were promptly seated once the others arrived. Our waiter briefly explained the brunch options and got us started on drinks. Honestly he was one of the best servers I've had recently and I wish I had gotten his name to pass along the praise.   The food selection for brunch was one of the largest and most interesting I've seen anywhere in Charlotte. I had the polenta for a starter (pictured) and eggs Benedict for my main. All delicious. I'll mention the Benedict comes on thick bread which I expected to be difficult to cut - no way, it was soft and easy to eat!  Did they think of everything??   Two thumbs up and five star for sure. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is a really cool looking restaurant, and it seems that someone spent a lot of time picking out bar stools, lighting fixtures, counter tops and flooring. I would rather have seen the same attention to detail in the food and the service, but that's just me.   I sat in the downstairs bar and found the waitress to be scarce when my glass was empty and stopping by a couple of times just after she brought the drink, I will say that she seemed new and a little nervous so maybe it's not the norm.   As for the food, I found the carpaccio with the red cabbage to be unique but disappointing. The calamari itself was nothing special although the sauce it was served with was interesting (in a good way).   I am assuming based on the decor this place will have a decent crowd so if I find myself back there I will sit AT the bar and grab a bite elsewhere."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot, the location is convenient, just a few blocks off of uptown, 2 blocks away from the freeway. But it is in upscale little condo land \"metropolitan\" along with Aveda spa and Pisces! Ashley is my server and she is great! She went above and beyond to make me feel comfortable! She also is very understanding with my many needs. The mussels are really awesome and the garlic bread that came along with it was well prep. I enjoyed the mojito drink which was I requested to be more sugary. Their cheese cake is great too. I will definitely come often when I need a good place to relax. My recommendation is come between 2:30 and 4:30 pm during a week day to enjoy the ambiance in a quiet and undisturbed manner!"}
{"text":"As a fan of brunch, I'm always looking for a good solution for my raging Sunday hunger pangs. After church, we decided to swing by Vivace.   On the positive side, they had $2.50 mimosas. Also noteworthy is the bruschetta appetizer. With a chunky pesto, warmed tomatoes and cheese on super crusty bread, it's probably the most well-executed menu item we tried.  There were some down sides, too. The mimosas were constructed en masse in carafes, and weren't cold enough. The Mr ordered a lemoncello that was far too subtle for our taste. It lacked any zing and felt far too heavy for the generous serving size. That was disappointing.   I ordered the Caprese Panino, imagining a crispy edged panini dripping with gooey mozzarella. My stupid American expectations were dashed by a very forgettable sandwich on ciabatta. Cold, sliced mozz. Pesto. Smoked Tomatoes. It was filling but none too impressive. The bread was the biggest component of the sandwich, and I don't think it should have been.  On the side, I made the mistake of ordering the Tuscan Potatoes. The only thing going for these tubers was the flavor. They were HUGE, over-fried and dry. The Mr eventually had to ask for some ketchup to moisten them enough to choke them down. I would have preferred that they were smaller, at the very least.  Service was fine, bathrooms clean, live music on the patio, and apparently the Mr enjoyed his steak and eggs.  Overall, I'd go back, but not for brunch."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic place all around. The ambiance is warm, tables are well spaced, and they have interesting corner booths and seats (where we were) that help facilitate conversations. We started with the steamed pei mussels appetizer, which was delicious. As some others have noted, you'll want to sop up the sauce with bread. My wife also tried two of their specialty drinks, which I can't recall, but were both good. Next we ordered a pappardelle with bolognese to split, and our server brought it on split plates. Also amazing. Finally, my wife and I both ordered the lamb shank over a saffron risotto. Cooked perfectly, and the risotto may have been my favorite part of the meal. I'm a lamb freak/snob - so this was impressive. Apart from the food, our service was outstanding - Meagen was our server.   This was a really great experience that I'd highly recommend to anyone. Easily the best Italian restaurant that I have been to in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I was a little pissed because they were only offering the restaurant week menu, but the waiter (Woody) said we do  À la cart as an option, so we stayed! My boyfriend got the Ligurian Cacciucco with a side of risotto which he loved, and I got a simple pasta with shrimp, and it was very good! The food was great, but the waiter/service was amazing! We appreciate great service, and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a hidden gem. Came alone on a business trip after a long day of traveling and sat on the patio under cafe lights overlooking a bit of the Charlotte skyline. Awesome music selection, chill vibe, attentive and friendly service (thanks Jim!) And WOW on the food. I had the grillen salmon with brussels, pancetta, and apples with a side of mushrooms.. huge portion of mushrooms, would be good to split the sides. Salmon dish was generous but well portioned as well. Very pleased."}
{"text":"Met up here with some girlfriends for dinner on a Friday night. We sat on the patio and enjoyed the skyline view. I had the Limonada cocktail which was very good. You could barely taste the alcohol. For my main course, I had the salmon. It was VERY good. This was on the list of my waiter's recommendations, and I will definitely get it again."}
{"text":"Nice, fancy, feel like you're in some other city, but more fusion than Italian.  Great Patio, great upstairs bar and view of the city."}
{"text":"We miss VIVACE so much, the Raleigh location is run a bit tighter but the food is fantastic at both locations.  TIPS:   1. Order the Margarita Pizza with a side of crushed red pepper 2. Pair it with a glass of \"Gertrude\" red blend (Cab, Merlot, Sangiovese) 3. The Hanger Steak with the braised short rib and Yukon potatoes is awesome so order that. 4.  The Pasta's are made in-house and you can taste the difference, have someone else order a pasta dish and steal a bite."}
{"text":"Always spotted this place when i go to the sushi spot near  here in the same shopping center. My friend and i heard they were having a daytime brunch and we decided to go. I love everything about Vivace, from the atmosphere ,from the way its decorated, the vibe, the beautiful people, from food and drinks. Will definitely frequent this place of business the warmer it gets so we can eat outside.I had the calamari and my friend had the meatballs my maraschino Moscow mule was pretty good. Will be back here most definitely."}
{"text":"Classy and hip, modern and classic. Vivace is a the type of establishment you can take your mom to on Thursday then romance that special someone on Friday. The decor is lush and isn't all glamor and glitz. They have amazing service and also great food to back up that pretty little face.   Braised short rib, fried calamari, shrimp capellini - all fabulous. If you want a little more adventurous, eye opening dining experience ask for a seat in the Chef's corner. Not only will you get to see the masters at work, they might even be as generous as to give you free sampling of some tasty treats.   Now that the secrets been out, make sure you make a reservation! This place gets packed and I can assure you, it isn't all hype!"}
{"text":"After another lovely evening here, I have to update my stars. Such a good place to get a nice meal!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is nice, appetizers were fair and but the entrees were a complete disappointment!  We were with a party of five and each person commented that their food was very so so.  The menu selection is also very small.  Skip this one."}
{"text":"$30 bottom-less mimosa/bloody Mary brunch - enough said!  $30 brunch (we went on Saturday) gets you unlimited mimosas and/or bloody Marys (you can switch back and forth between them as often as you'd like).  You also get two courses (one each from the left and ride sides of the menu).  I got the mussels (weird for brunch, but I love mussels) and the chicken biscuit (similar to a biscuit and gravy with fried chicken on top).    The mussels were fine - but I've had much better.  The chicken biscuit was on point.  You will get a lot of food.  Our table of four shared a bunch of our items and we couldn't finish out plates.  Now, the 3854 mimosas maybe filled us up, but the food was still all pretty good.  Now, the mimosas.  Let's just say, we uber'ed there and back - and I'm very happy that we did.  Our boozy brunch turned into a 4pm bedtime - and a pretty nice headache.  We will definitely check it out again - likely for brunch.  I'll just pace my mimosas better next time."}
{"text":"OMG THE La Vigili 7 course menus with wine paring was awesome!!  We dined here on Christmas Eve. And we will be coming back"}
{"text":"You couldn't ask for a more beautiful location- overlooking the city by a beautiful public park and river (which the city has fine a great job restoring and maintaining). Gorgeous for night and day.  Amazing service, Emmanuel helped us out and was incredibly attentive and thoughtful.   Awesome design, decor and music. This place is sleek but comfortable and completely relaxing.   Great food at reasonable prices- a good place to get Italian deli meats and thin crust pizza. Really enjoyable and delicious.   We just stopped in this place as we were traveling through town, thanks fellow yelpers, and it really made our day. Do the same, you won't regret it :)     - - - -  On the downside, their homemade ricotta is pretty off. It shouldn't be soup. Also the pizza dough is really close but not quite right -  It shouldn't be chip-like at the crust and should have that nice powder on it. Meats need to be cut better, and I think they have a loose understanding of what speck is. Their pecorino was pretty good though.   I have no doubt that these guys will get it right , and very soon. They seem to be working hard to perfect their dishes."}
{"text":"Vivace is a great restaurant with an amazing atmosphere and even better brunch menu. From NC to GA, this is the only restaurant i know of that has there own brunch package. At the price of $30, get your endless mimosas or Bloody Mary's, an appetizer and an entree. Yes, alladat! If not getting the package the mimosas are still $4 for a double which is still a great price. Although the brunch menu has changed a bit from my last visit (where is the French toast?!) it is still filled with a mix of Italian and American favorites. While eating their for New Year's Eve, i ordered the short rib over potatoes with poached eggs. It was hearty, filled with succulent short rib in a nice sauce and the eggs were perfectly poached. Although in my opinion the short rib needed a bit more salt and pepper, leaving it as it was is perfect for the many tastebuds that travel through. Overall, this is a great brunch spot for food and drinks with great friends or strangers because the people of Charlotte are always nice and welcoming! Also Alex the waiter upstairs is amazing and so very thorough!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service. The wine menu is good, but prices  could be intimidating. The food is amazing, recommend coming  here  during restaurant week."}
