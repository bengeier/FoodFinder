{"text":"We had Q Up! Barbeque at our company Christmas party and all of the food was to die for.  The Gansta Grilled Cheese was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had!  I mean, come on...mac 'n cheese in a sandwich?!?  I'd eat this every day if I could.  Our employees loved the tacos too.  They were super friendly with all of our employees, responsive and very easy to work with in planning the menu for our event.  I'd highly recommend them for corporate events, and I'm going to track this food truck around Phoenix for another one of those sandwiches."}
{"text":"So I haven't been able to find these guys on Yelp, so I'm adding them.  They are all over the Phoenix valley from the standard Food Truck nights down at the Phoenix Public Market to what seems like weekly food truck events popping up in Scottsdale, Mesa, Chandler...you name it.  I first tried them about a month ago on a Wednesday night at the Phoenix Public Market.  Wrapped with the guy a bit of how crazy the Scottsdale Street Eats was and that we got tired of battling for parking and turned away.  But I was glad I finally got to plate up.  Did it simple and just picked up a huge pork bbq sandwich smothered in coleslaw.  There was no way to eat this thing with my hands.  Luckily it is served with handy to-go fork and I sat down to dig in.  Massive sandwich for less than $8 and worth every penny.  Track them down at any of the events in the valley.  There is another Food Truck Festival tonight at the Phoenix Public Market if you're looking to track them down. Or find them on Twitter http://twitter.com/QupBBQ"}
{"text":"Mmmmm, Finally hit the food truck gathering and tried this place. I am a fan. I had the bbq pulled pork sandwich and the mac and cheese bites. Yummy. The pors was not dry and covered in bbq sauce like most places to it. It was juicy and tender. The mac and cheese bites were yummo as well, Totally a fan. I would have this place again."}
{"text":"We have had these guys at Gcu for the last week and the gangsta grilled cheese has rocked my world. The brisket, Mac and cheese, sour dough masterpiece defines a grilled cheese sandwich for me. Staff seems cool and the wait time was not bad at all. Would eat again."}
{"text":"WOWZERS! This truck was parked in front of the State Capitol downtown Phoenix where i work and MY OH MY!! iI had the gangsta Grilled Cheese Sandwich which was pretty gangsta! Brisket, melted cheese, and mac and cheese on sourdough bread. I didn't want the sandwich to end it was SO good. Highly recommend Q Up. Service was fast and SUPER friendly. Thank you!"}
{"text":"If my wife didn't limit me to this place to only one or two times a week, I would eat it everyday. The Gangsta grilled cheese is the best, but one day they sold out of brisket (I got there near the end of their time near the AZ Capitol) and got it with their sausage. WOW! Now I special order it that way.  Although I rarely stray from the Gangsta grilled cheese, my boss loves the pulled pork so much that I invite him to lunch when I need him in a good mood. My clients have loved the pulled pork, Mac n cheese and coleslaw that they want QUp to cater some events later this year.  Finally, their nachos are amazing. With allow the sauce and meat, it is amazing that the chips are still crunchy even after I have to wait to finish my Gangsta grilled cheese.  Took some of the food to one of the Scottsdale hospitals and we were nearly thrown out of the Dr's lounge because the food smelled and looked delicious compared to their cafeteria food.  Must try food."}
{"text":"I ate at this food truck in Sept. 2017 during Foodie Fest in Las Vegas.  I got the plate called \"The People's Choice,\" and chose pulled pork with the bacony mac-n-cheese as my side.  I took my first bite within 20 seconds of receiving my plate, and the pulled pork was cold. It also didn't come with that much sauce. I had enough sauce for about 40% of the pulled pork, and had to eat the remaining 60% without sauce, which was of course pretty dry.   The bacony mac-n-cheese was also cold and it just wasn't very good. Even with the bacon added to it, it wasn't anything special and didn't have that much flavor. Just very bland. I've had better mac-n-cheese from a Kraft box.  If I ever came across this food truck again, I definitely would not get anything from it, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else."}
{"text":"Q Up came to our school festival and we just had to try the Loaded Fries and the Gangsta Grilled Cheese....they were both to die for. My son said it was the most amazing grilled cheese he'd ever had. So yummy. We will definitely have to find them again."}
{"text":"WOW!  I love this Food Truck!  Devin & Cat are everything you hope to encounter when walking up to a food truck for the first time.  A real 'small business', eat local type feel and the warmth you would expect from a family run business.  On to the food:  I have only eaten 1 item from Q Up...  and as far as I am concerned it could be the last thing I ever eat in my life!  This sandwich is RIDICULOUS...  The Gangsta Grilled Cheese could quite possibly be the best sandwich ever created.  It includes ingredients like BBQ, Mac & Cheese, and Sourdough.  Need I say more?  Anyone who doesn't like this meal is crazy!  Also worth mentioning that the BBQ alone is top notch.  The sauce is perfectly balanced and the meat is so tender and delicious I think it might be made from unicorns.  I could go on and on about how much I like the experience from Q Up but am getting hungry and they are not out right now...  I am a bit of a Food Truck Junkie and tend to be a bit critical... Q Up Passed with flying colors.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"We are in San Diego at the foodie fest we paid $16 for a plate of hot food and it came out extremely cold and the Mac and cheese I could make better at home. The meat was tasty we just prefer hot food. Sorry but if you moved to San Diego we definitely wouldn't be going back"}
{"text":"All you need to know about this truck: MAC N' CHEESE!!! Bacon, cheese...what more can you ask for!  I had the opportunity to try this truck at the Las Vegas Foodiefest, amazing! The food was delicious and the staff was so nice! I am so glad they made the trek up from Phoenix. We definitely can't wait to have them back in Vegas soon!  nom nomm!"}
{"text":"Q Up is absolutely incredible! Devin was wonderful to work with- very pleasant and responsive and he guided us to use 1 food truck for our 130ppl wedding which ended up being absolutely perfect. The guests were all pleased with the lack of long lines, and everyone was commenting on how excellent the food was! We had them tray pass food for cocktail hour which was both flawless and delicious, and the dinner service was amazing and exceeded our expectations in every way. The sandwiches were a HIT, and I LOVED the meat plate with pulled pork, fries and coleslaw. The mac n cheese was a fan favorite as well. Honestly, couldn't recommend this company and their fast and friendly service more! Can't wait to go back to AZ to seek out the truck and eat their delicious food again!"}
{"text":"YUM, YUM, YUM! We hired Q-up for our wedding and they did an AMAZING job. The Gangsta Grilled Cheese was the best thing I have ever eaten. Seriously SO good! Devon is so sweet and was a joy to work with! People were raving all night about the BBQ. I can not thank the crew enough for all of their hard work. I am hoping they make their way to Portland next summer :)"}
{"text":"Had the Gangsta Grilled Cheese - which has macaroni and cheese, brisket, and sauce on grilled sourdough - with their coleslaw which had a kick.   All very tasty but very much embodies the \"fat kid food truck\" due to how unhealthy it is. The food was quick, though and filling for what you pay for."}
{"text":"This is not your typical food truck but a barbecue heaven on wheels!"}
{"text":"I've had this saved for as long as I can remember & was so excited when I finally had the chance to try them out. Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed. I'm no stranger to food truck prices so $12 for the sandwich wasn't outrageous but how it fell so flat really made it harder to stomach paying so much. I had the Gangster Grilled Cheese & the bbq was so vinegary tasting, it almost was like it came from a bottle. I couldn't even finish it, no one in my party cared for it either so I tossed it. Such a bummer! I had such high hopes."}
{"text":"Tried the Beef Brisket with the truck made tortilla chips.  It was good.  Would have liked a bit more BBQ sauce.  Really enjoyed scooping the meat up on the chip.  Would not have enjoyed it as much had a picked a different side."}
{"text":"The gangsta grilled cheese is amazing. It is bbq brisket and bacon mac n cheese inside of a grilled cheese sandwich. Delightful."}
{"text":"Tried Q Up at the Las Vegas Foodie Fest.  We got the Gansta Grilled Cheese and our friends got the BBQ Nachos.  Both were really good.  The Gansta Grilled Cheese was brisket, bacon mac and cheese, and bbq sauce on grilled sourdough.  Super yummy, messy goodness.  Service was fast and friendly.  Will def hit this truck up when in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The brisket was ok. The sauce was spicy, the portion was right. The mac and cheese was awful and cold. I made sure to make eye contact with the guy as I threw the majority in the trash."}
{"text":"Tried their food last night at First Fridays, and I'll definitely be seeking them out again in the future.   I got the BBQ nachos, and my boyfriend got the tacos. The nachos were incredible. Served on the heartiest tortilla chips I've ever had, which prevented any soggy nacho situations from happening. They had big, delicious chunks of tomatoes, and no shortage of pulled pork & cheese. The tacos were also delicious. They have the southwest slaw on them, which I definitely think I'll be ordering as a side next time I visit.   Extremely friendly people working, great food, cheap prices. What more could I ask for? Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My favorite food truck of all. Always very delicious bbq and large portions. Of course I LOVE the bbq brisket but the 3 combo with pork and sausage is divine. The coleslaw is yummy too!  It is heaven that we can often enjoy Q UP downtown on Fridays for lunchtime!  If you havent tired it, be sure to soon!"}
{"text":"This truck was plopped in our parking lot for one hot afternoon. I was craving some barbecue and thought it better for someone else to suffer over some hot kitchen appliance than myself.   I was not impressed.   I ordered the three meat meal because I earned it. Okay I wanted it and my cash was burning a hole in my pocket. The pulled pork was almost dry despite being served in a veritable pool of liquid. I could barely taste the difference between the brisket. Not a great start. The grilled sausage was decent, nothing to write home about.  Just an average, overpriced meal.   Your basic food truck."}
{"text":"I am saving a star.. It could have been the sun stroke or just that it was new to me but the pulled pork was a little mushy. The flavor was there, the sauce was great... hmmm just something not perfect.   Speaking of perfect... get the mac n cheese with bacon... that was good.   I did sample some brisket.. maybe I need to go that route. It was very good."}
{"text":"Went there last night And they where closed went to a food truck rally or something in Texas.  Guess Surprise is not enough business for them.  Well I will never go back"}
{"text":"HOW DID I NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS GUY BEFORE.  A couple of my coworkers invited me to walk down the block to check out a food truck that had arranged to be in the neighborhood today and let's say I am glad I went.  Q-UP does everything homemade and it is all amazing. The owner was extremely polite and friendly; and I ordered the BBQ Nachos and a side of the Macaroni.  The macaroni had homemade cheese and was full of big chunks of smoked bacon. The owner suggested putting some of their BBQ sauce on it too, which was definitely good advice.   This was the best mac and cheese I have ever had.  Then came the nachos, handmade chips with pulled pork, nacho cheese, tomatoes, green onions, and topped with their homemade sauce.  I've never had a plate of nachos more heavenly.   I don't know if BBQ sauce makes everything better or if it's just this guy's. He does tacos too, but I wasn't able to try them today...next time.  My buddies and I ordered some of the smoked sausage though as an aftertought with their mustard BBQ sauce, and he gave us a sample of the brisket to try as well.  I am elated with the quality, I've never been big on street food before, but I am a believer now.  The best part? It's priced right. The mac and nachos together cost me ten bucks even, and the nachos were a nice big portion. He takes plastic also, so don't sweat the cash thing. For a food truck in the days of $5+ hot dogs, a ten spot goes a long way at Q-Up, I was impressed.  If this guy is in your neighborhood, make the trip. I was told he announces where he'll be on Twitter so you can stalk him, I mean, follow him.  Great stuff!"}
{"text":"2nd time I've had the BBQ nachos and they sure don't disappoint!! I refuse to even share them with the hubby, he can get his own. Eventually I'll get to trying the other menu items."}
{"text":"Originally, I was going to try another food truck last Wed at the ASU food truck party (mostly because I was wearing white and white clothes + BBQ dont entirely mix), but when I saw Q Up's tweet about their special of the day, I was in.  I had the special (smoked potato and bacon soup) and the mac and cheese. The soup was sooo good. I couldnt really taste the smoke, but the cheese and scallions added some delicious layers of flavor. The mac and cheese was kind of a disappointment, but like any mac and cheese lover, Im willing to give it another shot.  Im excited to actually try their BBQ next time (update to come)!"}
{"text":"I probably tried them a while back at Las Vegas Foodie Fest, but I didn't write a review. Whether I actually visited or not, it's time to fix that mistake.  The festival's been renamed as the Great American Foodie Fest and moved to a casino parking lot within the borders of Las Vegas's next-door neighbor Henderson, but Q Up Barbeque has seemingly been there every single time for the past several years. It's always a treat to get to experience out-of-town trucks, especially if they're as good as Q Up.  I had the Three Meat Plate ($16 at this particular event), which comes with \"spicy\" sausage (it was mild at worst), brisket, and pulled pork along with a choice of side. I went with the \"Kicked Up!\" slaw because the Bacon Mac & Cheese was unavailable, and I really found it hard to appreciate any contribution from the slaw except perhaps with the rich sausage. The brisket was fatty and delicious on its own, but the pulled pork went best with the excellent BBQ sauce. With the disclaimer that I have not been to the South, these smoked goodies are definitely among the better BBQ meats that I've tried.  That BBQ sauce was so nice that it impressed me as the lone topping on my first taste of my friend's BBQ Pork Nachos ($10 at this event), which had super crispy tortilla chips, pulled pork, and an array of typical nacho toppings. Unfortunately, that included the ubiquitous liquid cheese that eventually really soaked the chips and caused the bottom layer of chips to turn soft. This is one of those dishes that you'll love if you're hungry and have friends with whom you can share it.  [UPDATE 10/8:16: tried their version of the Gangsta Grilled Cheese per my friend's willingness to purchase and share it. Turns out that it's even better than the same-name sandwich from an Arizonan truck that's also their neighbor at this event. More meat, more creaminess, more flavor. No wonder the MC on the event's \"main stage\" was naming them as the best grilled cheese this year.]  I'd definitely be down to visit Q Up every time they come to Great American Foodie Fest. They have good food and they're good people, despite rooting for my favorite NFL team's division rivals. (It's cool, guys; I didn't watch the game because I was eating, but I'm sure your team deserved the win last night.)"}
{"text":"I love me some food truck fare and Q Up Barbeque did not disappoint! They were one of four food trucks waiting to feed hungry runners at the end of a race downtown Phx and once we saw BBQ shrimp tacos on the menu we knew which line to stand in for our post-race pigout.  We ordered the shrimp tacos (of course) and the shredded pork nachos. Both were outstanding. The shrimp was in a spicy BBq sauce and topped with a sweet, cool slaw that was a nice contrast to the hot sauce. The tortillas were nice and fresh.  The nachos were huge and exceptionally good. The chips were made from actual tortillas, not just some Tostitos chips out of a bag. The portion of shredded pork was plentiful and the nacho cheese sauce was actually a nice touch. You'd think it would make then funky but it totally worked. Grab a fork though, these nachos are messy. In a good way!  The only bummer is that it's a food truck so we can't go back and get more whenever we want! I will be on the lookout for this truck at future events for sure so I can get my nacho fix!"}
{"text":"Whenever I see this food truck, I always think how delicious some BBQ would be. They have tantalizing options such as meat plates, grilled cheese, and nachos. Well, I finally got to try it at the Food Truck Pork Battle a few months back. I'm glad I finally did just to sate my curiosity! The pulled pork and BBQ sauce were good - not my favorite but still tasty (Campfire Bistro is my current fav). I think the sauce could have used more of a kick or smokey flavor. My meal came with one side, so I chose the bacony mac and cheese. Everyone else seemed to be enjoying the mac and cheese, but not me. It had penne noodles that were too thick and didn't hold the cheese well. The cheese sauce was also a bit thin. Overall, it seemed like it had been made in a large batch and had been sitting out under a heat lamp for a while.   Overall, it wasn't my favorite. I might try it again, since I see them so often, but who knows. Everyone else seems to really enjoy it, so I'll just have to try something different next time!"}
{"text":"I got the Gangsta Grilled Cheese Sandwich and it arrived almost immediately. Clearly it was not made to order and I really didn't think the flavors went together.   That said the toast it was put upon was pretty good but sadly it ended there.  Not a fan."}
{"text":"Had the BBQ pork sandwich which was a huge portion of meat.  It was tasty, all shredded, and the slaw was actually what I liked the most, I think it had a little spice to it, either that or the meat did but the combo was really good!  The meat was not dripping or drenched in sauce, but it was nicely coated, semi sweet taste.  The bread held it all together.  I also had a side of fries which had a tasty salty coating, although some of the fries were too soft.    We visited this truck on Frist Friday in Phoenix.  They were quick and on point with the order.  The sandwich, fries and a drink was a total of $15."}
{"text":"It's food truck day at work!  I was excited to venture outside and see the barbecue folks set up by the curb, which is a nice change of pace from the usual stuff the cafeteria serves.  I ordered the Gangsta sandwich plus mac n cheese on the side.  The sandwich was good but not blow me away great, and didn't even make a pretense of healthy eating.  Fine, I knew it wasn't fine dining here.  I was also disappointed in my choice of sides, being chips, french fries, slaw, and mac n cheese.  It's barbecue, how about some cornbread, baked beans, corn on the cob, fruit or maybe even veggies to make things more interesting.  The mac and cheese itself was ok, but then everyone is putting bacon in things these days.    My biggest issue here was that I paid $15 for lunch at a food truck.  For that I could have had table service at my local Chilis or even a lunch special at Macaroni Grill.  I appreciate the work that went into making the meal, but asking for a gratuity on top of $15 for a sandwich and a side was a bit much."}
{"text":"Q Up BBQ was at the top of my list for the Great American Foodie Fest in Las Vegas. They didn't disappoint.  I saw pictures online of the Gangsta Grilled Cheese before visiting and was looking forward to a great grilled cheese. A great grilled cheese indeed. The Gangsta Grilled Cheese included bacon mac and cheese, BBQ meat, and BBQ sauce.   The different flavors worked perfectly together. The sandwich was perfectly put together so that the sandwich wasn't too big. Since it wasn't overloaded I was able to get all of the flavors in each bite instead of large bites of only one ingredient at a time. The bread was perfectly grilled and cheesy.   The Gangsta Grilled Cheese was definitely a highlight of my trips to Foodie Fest this year."}
{"text":"The 2 tacos for $8 is way too expensive, as the tacos are very small. Had to get more food after I ate them. Taste was ok. Overall, I was unimpressed. Probably won't return."}
{"text":"We LOVE Q Up BBQ, we had them for our Open House, and they totally nailed it! They food was AMAZING, service was friendly and professional. Everyone was so easy to work with. I would recommend them for any event! Do not have enough great things to say about them. Don't forget to try the Gangsta Grilled Cheese!"}
{"text":"My first time was last week when we went to the Food Truck Friday West. I ordered the Gangsta Grilled Cheese with fries. It is a \"slow smoked beef brisket topped with bacony mac-n-cheese and Q UP! BBQ sauce on toasted cheesy sourdough.\" You could taste the brisket, mac-n-cheese and BBQ sauce. My son and I split it and we both loved it! Only bummer was I couldn't really get the bacon, just wished there was maybe some crispy bits in there.The price was a bit high for my liking, but next time I'll just order it without fries. I definitely look forward to seeing them at the event next Friday."}
{"text":"We loved the barbeque tacos! What a unique and different combination! Other stuff on the menu looked great too."}
{"text":"Food was definitely not made to order, got the 3 meat plate & loaded fries. Got our order less than 2 minutes after ordering & both were cold."}
{"text":"I cannot recommend this truck.  For 12 bucks (!), I ordered the Brisket and Pork plate with mac and cheese.  The mac was okay but nothing special, pretty much Easy Mac.  The pulled pork was fully covered in sauce, and when I made back it to my desk it turned out to be a huge slab of pork skin and fat with some chopped pork on top (I have pics).  The brisket was gristly/fatty and I couldn't stomach it or the sauce.  Not sure if this company has one truck or many in the Phoenix area but the food that I bought today was not only overpriced....it literally made me sick.  I wouldn't give this place a second chance.  The low quality control, below average meat quality and mediocre taste really put me off."}
{"text":"I just ate from Q Up Barbeque for the first time and I loved the quality and amount of food they had on the Three Meat Platter.  The Bacony Mac N Cheese was delicious and their BBQ sauce is definitely one of my favorites.  I'll be keeping an eye on this truck as they move to different events in the valley so I can try some of their other items."}
{"text":"This is literally the best food truck I have ever tasted! Love the gangsta grilled cheese!  Perfect!!!!"}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this food truck ever since spotting it at the ill-fated Street Eats Food Truck Festival at Salt River Fields back in January 2012. Alas, long lines and a thousands of other hungy people conspired to keep me apart from Q Up Barbeque. This is why I was thrilled to see them at the New Times Friday Food Truck Court (at 12th Street and Jefferson in Phoenix) for lunch.  I tried the BBQ shrimp tacos, which were flavorful and rustic, tucked into slightly charred corn tortillas (2 for $7). I also picked up an item to share with my lunch companion, whom I had sent on a mission to procure Japanese/Mexican fusion tacos (see my review for Shinobu Diego's). That item was the BBQ Pork nachos, which included slow-cooked pork served over house-made (or truck-made, as was the case here) tortillas.  I consider Q Up BBQ a great addition to the Phoenix food truck landscape and will look for them again at future outings for tasty grub."}
{"text":"This is better than any food truck I've ever eaten at, and most BBQ restaurants for that matter! In addition to the sandwiches, loaded nachos, etc. they offer straight up plates of meat with sides. I'm a big fan of the plates because I don't really care about the bun. I've yet to find a side that isn't totally delicious. Even the coleslaw tastes great, and I usually hate coleslaw!  The people here are super friendly and attentive. In the months I've been going I've never once seen them mess up an order!   When you see these guys around, get excited. It's amazing and cheap local BBQ!"}
{"text":"Q Up makes exceptionally tasty BBQ. Their Gangsta Grilled Cheese has become my Wednesday go-to: it's a sloppy, barely-containable mess of brisket, melted cheese, their great homemade BBQ sauce, and their homemade mac 'n cheese, all served up on a great sourdough.  Their hand-cut fries are a perfect addition (though their tortilla chips are really great too) and I'm finding it nearly impossible to pull myself away from Q Up to any of the other food trucks.   The wait is never that bad, even with a bit of a line, and you never go away hungry. Q Up isn't just \"good as food trucks go.\" It's absolutely fantastic BBQ, great sauce, great meat, and insanely flavorful, if a bit damaging to the heart and waistline..."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of trying this food truck at the Las Vegas FoodieFest. There wasn't a long line, the food came out quickly and the staff was friendly. That as well as their Gangsta Grilled Cheese (grilled cheese with barbecued brisket, bacon and Mac and cheese!) had me there twice. If I ever see them around again I certainly will be getting another!"}
{"text":"Well not much to update here it's still damn good and it's only been 5 days since last visit.    Today I had: Pulled Pork Sandwich with Southwest Slaw and mustard bbq sauce.  It was amazing the slaw alone was outstanding but then pile it on top of a mound of smoked pork goodness and top it all off with tangy sweet sauce and you got yourself a winner.    I also had a side of bacon mac and cheese obviously it is a must and it was just as amazing as last week.    Best thing is he is going to be by my job in two days with fresh brisket : ) I can't wait."}
{"text":"I fell in love with their \"Gangsta Grilled Cheese,\" everybody loves it. If they are near you, gotta try it, you'll love it too."}
{"text":"This truck was parked outside my office yesterday so I went to check it out. I got the Gangsta Grilled cheese. I've got to say, it was delicious! I though it could use more meat; I only had a little piece in my whole grilled cheese but the flavors were fantastic. Nice work."}
{"text":"Good option for lunch, but not my favorite barbeque (although I'm from TX so the standard is high). I ordered the two meat plate for $10 which came with pulled pork, brisket, and choice of side. I picked mac and cheese for my side and loved it, it had a tiny biy of a spicy kick to it. Brisket was juicy and the right amount of fatty, althoguh I did get one end piece which was dry. The pulled pork was my least favorite part of the meal. I would definitely try this place again.  This food truck parks in front of the Dept of Corrections building on Washington St. on Tuesdays and sometimes Thursdays."}
{"text":"My favorite food truck in AZ. Love the loaded nachos, love the bacon green chile mac. I'm grateful we can have such amazing food on wheels!"}
{"text":"My first trip to QUP! BBQ was when they were one of the vendors at the Great American Foodie Fest at Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego. I had checked out the truck's menu online and knew I had to visit this vendor because of one thing: that \"Gangsta Grilled Cheese Sandwich.\"   I absolutely love grilled cheese, so while some of the other featured menu items sounded yummy, I stuck with my game plan and my friend and I ordered one of these savory sandwiches to share. Since we went to the fair soon after it opened, the line for QUP! was not too long ... in fact, I think there was only one person in front of us when we were ordering, and it didn't take too long for us to get our food, too.   I was definitely a fan of my grilled cheese, to say the least, and I wouldn't mind making a trip out to QUP! for more! Here's what I would recommend, as well as other menu items I would want to try on my next visit:   \"Gangsta Grilled Cheese Sandwich\": I think this is one of the food truck's staples and best-selling items. It features slow-smoked beef brisket topped with bacony mac-n-cheese and QUP! BBQ sauce on toasted cheesy sourdough. Amazing concoction. I loved the mac-n-cheese--though I would have preferred it to be a bit creamier and cheesier--and I appreciated the nice hint of bacon (sandwich could have used more bacon bits as well, but I was happy that I could still taste the smoky flavor of the bacon). The beef brisket was cooked well--smoky and savory, but not too tough to chew. And--best of all--there was a good-sized portion of beef brisket in that sandwich, so I got to enjoy some in every bite. The sandwich's breading was great as well; the exterior wasn't too crunchy but it wasn't soggy. Definitely would recommend this grilled cheese sando if you've never had it before.   \"The QUP! BBQ Sandwich\": Since I love BBQ flavors, I would want to try this sandwich on my next visit. It includes your choice of slow-smoked pulled pork or beef brisket topped with tangy southwest slaw and QUP! original BBQ sauce served on a freshly toasted bun. I would probably go with the pulled pork, since I have already tried the brisket and I like pulled pork better than brisket, anyway. I probably wouldn't eat the slaw (just cause I don't like coleslaw) but I look forward to tasting that delicious BBQ sauce.   \"QUP! Totally Loaded French Fries\": I'm a sucker for loaded fries, and these seasoned fries looked soooo good that I almost added them to my order. If I wasn't at a food truck fair (and planned to order from other vendors), I probably would have caved and ordered these savory fries as well. They come topped with smoked pulled pork, nacho cheese, QUP! Original BBQ sauce and green onions. I'd nix the green onions but everything else on these fries sound phenomenal. The fries are a great portion for sharing, too.   \"Three-Meat Plate\": If I wanted a great sampling of meats, this is the entrée I would order. It features slow-smoked beef brisket, pulled pork and a QUP! spicy sausage served with one side. For the side, I would probably opt for the bacony mac-n-cheese or QUP! seasoned fresh cut fries (especially because these fries looked thicker and were not thin, crispy shoestring fries). I'm definitely interested in trying that spicy sausage (hopefully it's not too spicy) and the juicy pulled pork that's a part of this entrée."}
{"text":"I'm going to have savory, sloppy, naughty dreams about those nachos. I had them for lunch yesterday and it's all I can think about."}
{"text":"The management company that manages the office building I work in has been arranging for a different food truck to come out during lunch hours the last couple of weeks. I have tried them all and haven't been disappointed yet..and today wasn't an exception.  We started out with samples of brisket and pulled pork topped with slaw. I have to say the brisket was one of the best I have ever, ever had. It was juicy and tender with a hint of smoke, just the way I like it. The sauce was sweet & spicy. The slaw on the pork was fresh with the addition of sweet red peppers and green onions, the dressing had a little bit of a kick.   Torn, I opted for the pulled pork nachos, the thought and concept was a little foreign to me at first but they intrigued me. Where to start. The thick corn chips were freshly fried, nothing bagged about these chips. The cheese sauce was pretty standard gooey cheese. The pork was flavorful and the fresh tomato chucks and green onions where a nice touch. My only complaint was that they had a little too much BBQ sauce on them for my liking. The chips stayed crisp and firm even the ones on the bottom. Highly recommend.  A co-worker had the pulled pork sandwich combo. The sandwich was served on a fresh hot dog style bun, which we found a little odd, but after much thought we came to the conclusion that if the sandwich would have been on a regular round roll it would not have been so easy to eat. It came with seasoned fries, which she said more than likely came frozen and could have been left in the fryer just a touch longer. She enjoyed the meat & slaw and said she would order it again.  Another co-worker had the 2 pork tacos. Basically the same as the sandwich only served on 2 awesome homemade corn tortillas. She loved it. We all loved our meals and  the value was great, the food was flavorful and plentiful. My $7 nacho easily could have fed 2 people.  Next time I have to have that brisket. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Q-UP. And I have to say when the family & I are in the mood for BBQ I am going to have to go out of my way hunt them down."}
{"text":"OMG I am new to the food truck revolution but we found this Q UP BBQ Truck at First Fridays in Phoenix last night... we were greeted by a nice lady and i think her son they were super welcoming and nice- the guy cooking maybe the husband??? They were all soo nice and he said we had to try his ribs- the nachos looked really good so we ordered BOTH!! I must say THESE WERE THE BEST NACHOS I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE- sweet tangy bbq pork and bbq sauce and nacho cheese and all the nacho toppings on sturdy tortilla chips SOOO DELICIOUS our friends ordered another- the ribs were ALSO TO DIE FOR- melted right off the bone covered in the sauce with a small side of fries- DELICIOUS, im going to follow this truck to see where they are so i can get my mex/BBQ FIX"}
