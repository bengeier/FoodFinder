{"text":"Full breakfast is served only on Saturday and Sunday.  We just had coffee and were surprised at how weak it was."}
{"text":"They have really great meatloaf and portobello sandwiches. The atmosphere is great and the owner is really nice. I would definitely recommend it as a place to go for lunch or a cup of coffee"}
{"text":"Sadly, I have given up on this little place.  I love coffee.....good coffee.  This is not a coffee shop, it's a gift store, slathered with the scent of candles and sachets (sorry, but I don't need this first thing in the morning, or ever, actually). 
 
I'm giving the 2 stars for what could be here, not what is.  You have the equipment, you have the location and the neat old building.  USE it!  Get rid of all the junk in this store and sell some great coffee (if you need extra revenue, replace the cutsey stuff with freshly roasted beans, maybe from an Indiana company...hmmmm...).  
There is so much potential here, but unless you love hair ties and dish towels, you might want to look elsewhere for a good cup of coffee."}
{"text":"Visiting from Chicago and we weren't sure where to go for breakfast. Decided to stop here and it was a great experience! I ordered a coffee beverage that I don't think was on the menu, but the gentleman made it anyway and it was delicious! My fianc√© had a peach tea that he enjoyed. Cute items throughout the store. Will go back next time we visit this area."}
{"text":"Excellent soup and sandwiches.  The sweets are fresh and tasty. The turkey pesto and tomato basil soup hits the spot"}
{"text":"What to get: turkey pesto sandwich & tomato basil soup
Service: 4/5

This is a local favorite of mine. I love going here for a quick bite to eat with my family. The food is always hot, fresh, & always tastes delicious. The turkey pesto sandwich is always a great combo with the tomato basil soup! They have very good earl grey tea too!"}
{"text":"This is a quaint coffee shop we visit every time we're near Madison, IN.  They have great coffee blends and delicious desserts!"}
{"text":"The iced coffee was very weak.  And a Turkey and Pesto Panini served with tortilla chips?  Go figure.  The food was not bad, just not memorable and quite pricey for what one received."}
{"text":"This is a warm, and inviting neighborhood coffee shop in Historic Madison. They offer a variety of tasty food, as well as a selection of gelato.

The service is also warm and friendly. Most importantly, the coffee is very good and they have a wide selection to choose from. I had the mint mocachino. It was a nice, warm pick-me-up on a surprisingly brisk July morning."}
{"text":"Just outside if the downtown shops I had past it for a year or better. Man I was missing out. Very nice place lunch selections with amazing flavors. Every coffee you can imagine, hot and cold. Deffenetly worth checking out."}
{"text":"Having coffee or lunch at The Attic feels a bit like having a meal at grandma's house, in the best possible way. It's the coziest spot, with beautiful interior decorates and tons of good smelling merchandise and attractive stationary for sale. There's a wide range of coffee and tea selections, with a surprising variety of flavors for coffee, as well as smoothies and cider. 

It can be challenging to find tasty vegetarian meals in smaller towns, which made The Attic's spinach veggie wrap all the more refreshing. With guacamole stuffed in with the greens, it was a crisp and delicious lunch, helping me feel a bit less guilty about the fried food I was definitely going to have later that day. As far as coffee shops go, this is definitely a spot to nestle between shopping, and maybe shop a bit in here as well."}
{"text":"While I wish there were more late night coffee shops like Starbucks or CBTL, I'm glad for cutesy quaint coffee shops that exist in small towns.  Coming from a bigger city or rather island, there's plenty of late night venues.  However being in Madison/Hanover area, there's not a lot of options but I love being at a little coffee shop on a lazy afternoon and just browsing their random offerings.  I loved looking at their knick knacks that they had to offer.  People were always so warm there too =)."}
{"text":"Had a really good Greek wrap for lunch and best of all: fresh brewed iced tea, offered sweet or unsweet earl grey and a flavor--I had blueberry and it was awesome. They have some cute little gift items and a TON of sweet treats. We watched the last slice of fresh made sugar cream pie walk out the door as we were coming in (insert sad face). Also, their breakfast menu looked awesome, and that may be where we have to try for brekkie next time we are in town. Very friendly staff and sweet atmosphere."}
{"text":"When I was visiting Madison in hopes of finding some hidden gems, this place looked promising. All I wanted was to fill my coffee mug for the 2 hour drive home... the woman working there was extremely confused when I asked her to fill my mug. She said she couldn't do that because she didn't know what to charge me. I pleasantly told her that she could charge whatever she thought was fair, I just didn't want to waste her paper cup since I had my own mug. Well, this was just too much for my hoosier friend behind the counter. There were two of us, each with our own mugs, and she wasted two paper cups, two sleeves each on us, which we threw in the trash immediately after transferring the hot beverages into our travel mugs. Why, oh why do hoosiers have such a hard time understanding things like cloth grocery bags and travel mugs? Please join us in the 21st century and start thinking about sustainability!"}
{"text":"My favorite lunch spot!  The turkey pesto panini and tomato soup combo is amazing.   Add a glass of sweet tea and you have the perfect lunch.  Be sure to save room for a chocolate chip cookie or slice of homemade pie for dessert!

The quality ingredients are even better when you discover many locally sourced ingredients. It doesn't get much better than this!"}
{"text":"I adore this little gem.
The staff are so nice and the coffee is great.
The baked goods are entirely scrumptious and all are homemade.
Cute decorum and just an overall charming little spot."}
{"text":"Nice place. Needed to find a comfortable place with wifi for a few hours in Madison and found my way here.  The panini was great (note - they only sell lunch stuff from 11 to 2ish), and the owner agreed to make me a tea latte.  Great gelato.  And it's fun to look at the Toyland whirligigs across the street."}
{"text":"On a day trip to Madison, we stopped by The Attic for lunch following a tour of the Lanier Mansion. I was looking forward to trying another option off the menu and hearing what my vegan friend thought of her selection.

My pal opted for the spinach veggie wrap minus the cheese. Her wrap was fairly basic, but she said it was tasty. I went with the tuna melt (subbing swiss for cheddar cheese) and a blueberry iced tea.
 
I loved their tuna salad! The herb mayo and champagne mustard create an incredible flavor combo. The multi-grain bread was a nice compliment for the filling. I also enjoyed the Rothschild raspberry salsa that comes with the side of blue corn chips.

I've resisted their mind-blowing selection of desserts on the last two visits. I'm going to try the caramel apple pie next time!"}
{"text":"I eat here daily! I love the family. They are friendly and care about their business and the products they serve! They have lots of fresh roasted coffee if that's your thing! They have grown this area 10x in the last year. Rumors have it that Chip and Brent are expert roasters. I'm a tea girl myself. The food is excellent! I'm vegetarian and they offer great choices. Portobello Panini, Black Bean Panini, the veggie wrap, plus anything else I request sans the meat. The soups are great! Daily Tomato Basil Soup which is excellent on a cold fall or winter day plus a soup of the day. Meat-eaters could cause a riot on chicken pot pie soup day! The desserts are spectacular! Sugar Cream Pie, Dutch Apple, the coffee cake, giant cookies, brownies... I could keep going but you get the idea! It's like your grandma made them all. They are a great asset to the town of Madison! Visitors should make it a point to head to the corner of Main and Mill. It's a Madison staple!"}
{"text":"Best pimento cheese spread on the planet! Everyone was so kind who worked there! They have adorable little gift items and crafts for sale, too. I would have indulged more in the sweets and coffees if I weren't in the middle of a long day of hiking. Everything sounded delicious!"}
