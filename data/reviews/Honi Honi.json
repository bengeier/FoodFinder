{"text":"Extremely disappointing! I've eaten a lot of pokes in Hawaii, so when the whole phenomenon happened here in MTL, I was thrilled.  Since, I've been going around the city looking for the best poke in town. I was really excited to hear that a poke place was opening up in Verdun.  I have modest expectations: taste good, decent portions and that the price reflects the quality of the food. Sadly, it did not meet my expectations.  It was tasteless! Instead of keeping it simple, they tried to put too many things (little rice, kale, cabbage, edamame, Litchi (yup you read that right), ginger, corn (again wtf), carrots, cucumber, a bit of salmon and a sauce but quite frankly I don't even know what it was because it tasted like nothing). The price of $18(tax included) did not reflect the quality & taste.  If you're a fan of Poke, I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Expérience déplorable... La personne en charge de la place était méprisante de ce qui semblait être de nouveaux employés en plus de ne pas connaître ses différentes sauces offertes. LE THON etait en CANNE... Zéro fraîcheure... Il manquait des ingrédients et ils ont fait des erreurs dans la commande. Terrible et extrêment décevant pour le prix!"}
{"text":"J'ai déjà eu le temps d'y aller deux fois, depuis l'ouverture. J'adore, j'adore j'adore. La deco inspiré de la mer, la musique et le personnel. J'aime beaucoup ce nouveau resto. J'ai choisi le bowl au thon rouge, c'était pas mal, et tellement copieux, à la sauce ponzu...hmmm, le tout est de ne pas devenir accro."}
{"text":"As a big fan of pokebowls, I was a bit disappointed by the place. At this place you can either make your own bowl or choose one pre-made for about the same price (16-18$). I made one with spicy salmon, rice, and then added some usual veggies and garnishes such as cucumber, carrots, avocado. The result turned out unexpected. The bowl had wayyyy too much mayo and carrots and not enough of the other ingredients. It was very unbalanced and I found it too pricey for what it was. With tax and tips I paid 22$ for a pokebowl...  As for the service, the 2 staff were quite nice and made us try some sauce before ordering. However, towards the end, the waiter seemed to pressure us to leave when half of the restaurant was empty.   Don't think I would come back."}
{"text":"We were craving Poke Bowl... And were on the lookout for our new best place. Honi Honi was the one!!! The staff is super friendly and does everything for you to be delighted.  We were by the whole experience of making your own Poke Bowl and by the freshness of the food... 95% of the ingredients are fresh.  I have never tried the thick noodles and always picked rice and salmon. As other reviews, I found everything to be well balanced. I eat my food with very little dressing because I like to taste the food and could not say it near to \"too much\". I had the teriyaki sauce, really nice and subtle.  I have been going every other week and will keep going as long as they deliver this quality of food and great service.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant yesterday. I admit, as a meat-loving carnivore, I was a bit reluctant to purchase what is essentially a $16 salad. Boy was I wrong!  I ordered the chicken poke bowl with the Honi Honi sauce. It was fully loaded and super healthy. It consists of a large variety of vegetables, chicken, and rice. My wife and son ordered the tofu and salmon bowls, respectively. They loved their meals as well, but we're unable to finish them due to the large quantity of food.  Apparently, the food doesn't keep very long in the fridge. My wife put hers in the fridge for a few hours to eat afterwards, but it wasn't as good at that point.  Only order here if you've got a large appetite and you won't be disappointed.  The young lady who took our order was jovial and helpful, especially since we've never ordered from there before.  It may seem a bit pricey, but you definitely get what you pay for. Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"The key to this place is to do your own poke. It was delicious and big portions too. The price is pretty much the same that you pay at any poke place (about 18 without tip). Staff was very friendly, place very neat and fast service. I'll be coming back for sure. Btw, they have tofu option for vegetarians."}
{"text":"Another good local restaurant open in Verdun. I am not a Poke expert but do know what I like and I liked this place. If you want something a little different with fresh ingredients try this place. It is clean, casual decor , well done that makes for a nice environment and the service was top notch. They offer samples of the vinaigrette if you are unsure. The Poke bowl itself can be a standard pick from the menu or a build your own. The portions are generous and fresh. The taste was excellent ( it is fresh vegetables). We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"God love you, Hawaii. Not only do you have a fabulous lush climate but because of the multi-cultural mix of the islands, this has also spilled over into your food. Pokebowls are a perfect example. Take all the ingredients of Japanese maki rolls, the veggies and fruits available on the islands, put them out in a large salad bowl form and voila! Pokebowls.  Honi Honi has been open for several months now in Verdun and practically everyday, whenever I walk by, there's tons of people in there giving the place a constant hum and catching the looks of older pedestrians looking in and trying to figure out if the place is Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese or what. I stuck to a pretty solid stand-by, spicy salmon and jeez, talk about a generous portion! My pokebowl came with crunchy noodles, mango, red cabbage, lettuce, cucumber slices, shelled edamame beans, pickled ginger, a giant mound of cubed raw salmon, with a generous portion of fish roe on top, all of this sitting on a bed of rice and baby kale, and doused with the spicy salmon sauce. This is not only healthy and fresh eating, but super-tasty too.   They also have appetizers like crab cakes and shrimp tempura on the offering but between my pokebowl and mason jar white sangria (again, very generous portion) I'm glad I didn't order anything since I was stuffed. I can see myself becoming a regular here during the summer months when you want to eat light anyway."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were looking for a place to have dinner Friday night when we stumbled upon Honi Honi. - and what a delicious surprise. The best poké bowl in town. Portions were generous and fresh, even the portion of my glass of wine was generous. The staff was very friendly and polite. We will definitely be coming back."}
