{"text":"After reading some of the other reviews listed I'm glad we were able to experience this place at an off time and without an event going on at the arena.  We went here for a late lunch and were not disappointed at all.   Our server was fantastic, although it was pretty funny when I asked her about one of the beers listed on their menu and she went into detail telling me all about it and then informing me that they didn't have it at the time.  We had just flown into the area and she was really informative and helpful with all of the questions we had.  The food we ordered was really good. We had appetizers and sandwiches and everything was cooked perfectly and really tasty."}
{"text":"Whiskey Rose is a great. We always come here Wednesday Nights!! Good drink specials! Staff is friendly!! Thank You Mark I."}
{"text":"John and his entire crew set the bar for service at Westgate!!!! Best part of our trip to AZ! Thanks John! You guys rock!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty bad when you are sitting at the bar and all 3 bartenders ignore you and we literally had to wave our arms to get their attention and then receive rude service.  Don't think we will order round two!"}
{"text":"First time to the Whiskey Rose, I was more than impressed. I was in town for the Penguins VS Coyotes game and was looking for a place to have a quick meal and some drinks prior to the game. After striking out at Yardhouse across the way, my boyfriend and I stumbled into this place. Quickly we found a spot at the bar and we were greeted by Nadia the bartender. She took our drink order right away and offered us a food menu. I noticed that offered a pulled pork poutine, so we ordered that and some fried pickles. When the food arrived it looked amazing, pickles were delicious but the pulled pork poutine was missing everything that made it poutine (fries, gravy, and cheese curds). I told the bartender and she quickly asked for the correct entree. A few mins later the bar manager came over to inform us they were out of gravy and offered us something else to eat. While I was a bit disappointed, it's hard to find poutine in my area, the entree that was originally brought looked amazing so we asked for that. It did not disappoint, I was a huge fan of the pulled pork and everything that came with it. I applaud the staff here at the Whiskey Rose for being efficient and personable! Keep it up, and I will for sure return when I am back in town!!!"}
{"text":"Never giving this place my business again. Kicked out and cut off from drinking water after ordering 3 drinks the entire night. The bartender who kicked me out never even served me, even the bouncer was not sure why she had asked him to escort my friend and I out because I was just standing there chatting drinking water. It's bad business kicking out your customers for trying to be responsible with drinking especially when they were clearly not intoxicated and then not have a reason as to why they're being kicked out."}
{"text":"Great service! Average food, but priced right! Love their patio! Very disappointed that they dont have draft beer!  Every bar has draft beer!"}
{"text":"First of all, I was there Sat. evening, 6/13 which was the evening of the Aerosmith concert.  All restaurants were packed & had wait times of an hour or more.  Whiskey Rose gave me a wait time of 40 mins, since I was alone.  I'm waiting outside & now when the wait time is pushing an hour, I'm starting to get annoyed as the arena will be opening the doors in 15 mins.  I went back to the desk, told the girls that you told me the wait time was going to be 40 mins, we're now at 1 hour.  Can you seat me or not?  I, also, said that if they can't seat me, please be up front about it, & I'll just go on to the arena, getting something to eat at one of the snack bars.  They told me they could seat me in a corner, I said fine that I simply want to get dinner at this point.  Now, on to my meal.  I ordered the beef brisket with sides of beans & cole slaw.  I got the lean brisket which might have been the problem.  When my plate was brought out, the brisket was cold, had some cold BBQ sauce drizzled over it.  The meat was very tough.  The sides were ok.  I know I should have brought this to my server's attention, under normal conditions I would have.  At this point, I simply wanted to eat what I could stand, pay my check, & get to the concert.  Service was adequate.  Place terribly noisy.  I paid $16 for pretty bad BBQ which might have been worth $6.  I live in Chandler, so seriously doubt that I will be going back here, again.  If I am in Glendale for a concert in the future, & want to get a meal, it most certainly will not be at WR.  I'll just get something to eat in my area before I start the drive to Glendale"}
{"text":"Recommend for Happy Hour.  There are many choices on the appetizer list and the portions were large.  Lots of TV's around the bar and restaurant."}
{"text":"I work in the Food and Beverage industry. I am attending a convention with 10000 of my closest friends and this place had it together. I've been to several large convention like this and the restaurants nearby are never prepared. Well done!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Whiskey Rose twice now and unfortunately will never be returning. This afternoon my wife and I decided to drop by around the beginning of happy hour for a drink and early dinner. The restaurant was completely deserted, we were the only customers. We sat at the bar and she jokingly said (with a smile) \"Wow, where is everyone?\" to the bartender. He responded by launching into an outrageously condescending explanation of 9-5 jobs and why the average person would never be at a restaurant/bar in the afternoon. We should have just left at this point but, against our better judgement, we actually stayed and placed an order.  The rest of our time there was spent listening to the bartender (a guy with a large beard, backwards hat, and lots of tattoos- in case anyone in management reads this and is wondering). We basically endured a long lecture about the local restaurant industry and how he's the greatest salesman of all time and makes piles of money. And no point was he anything other than arrogant and rude. We actually tipped $0, which I'm not sure I've ever done, considering that my wife and I have both previously spent a great deal of time working in restaurants.   Unfortunately, the food was excellent and it's a shame that one of their employees made the entire experience so outrageously unpleasant that I'll never go back."}
{"text":"went there last Saturday with friends and had a very good time , meal and drinks were good , could not finish my Pulled Pork sandwich.  left full and content .Will return at a later  date ."}
{"text":"The food isn't bad .  A little over priced and not great like everything in Westgate.  The service is very poor.  I have been there several times but will not be returning due to the service."}
{"text":"We went for my brothers 21st birthday and instead of cutting off a 21 year old they gave him shot after shot until he was so messed up but instead of letting the party of 15 eat and have the birthday boy sober up they KICK HIM OUT ! And since we all canceled our food orders the waitress refused to give the change back  for the drinks that we ordered. Horrible place and horrible operation!!! 12/7/16"}
{"text":"First visit.   Had a really nice server but don't remember her name.   We had a couple little toddlers with us so they sat us in the back but the food was great,  fast and priced as expected.   I would return."}
{"text":"Service sucks so bad here. Food is alright and drinks are pretty tasty. But this time it took our server forever to get us any thing to drink and take our food order. She checked on us once-we had to go up to the bar to get new drinks. Disappointed"}
{"text":"This place was a joke. The hostess told me the wait would be 30 min for a party of 2 and would call my cell phone when my table was ready. After 35 min of waiting she told me I was third in line. I went ahead and left. I checked my phone later and that stupid place never called me to say my table was ready!"}
{"text":"First time coming here. We ordered the 2 meat combo pulled pork and the brisket with the Mac and cheese and sweet potato fries. Food was not bad at all.   Service on the other hand started out great she asked us about 5 times if we are ready to order even though we explained it was our first time coming here and that it would be a minute and we were in no rush.  Asked for a beer and explained once again we were in no rush. Decided to order our food after the fifth time being asked within a 10 min time. After receiving our food the server never came back. After even finishing our meal she never asked if I care for another beer or how our meal was. After flagging her down still sitting now with an empty table because I personally bussed our table and removed all dishes to a table adjacent to us she then asked if we were done. My wife noticed the entire time we was talking with the other staff doing side work and on her phone.  All in all I feel that we would never come here again due to the poor service. (Nikki R) you have let us down."}
{"text":"First time here. The staff was very friendly and oh ur waitress was awesome. This is my new favorite place in the west valley.  Thank you for the good time."}
{"text":"The food was delicious . The service was terrible. After waiting 20 minutes to put in a food order the server brought us the wrong food and even left out part of our order. When we paid our tab she took the money and never came back . My husband had to sit there for 15 minutes and ask her for our change. The tab was 40 dollars and we gave her a 50. Assuming a 10 dollar tip was pretentious considering the fact that she screwed up the order on a rather slow night. I can look past most things, but coming from someone who used to serve tables , you should always bring back someone's change."}
{"text":"We stopped on a Sunday night, not many people, menu looked fairly good.. we were seated and served pretty quickly. After giving our drink order, another waitress stopped by and said she was sorry, she had not seen us and this was her area.. we told her we had already been served. So our original waitress brings back the drinks and takes our order.... after a while she brings our entrees, she had forgot the appetizer.. we asked another waitress for some water as we did not see ours for awhile, we did not get water from her.. the original came back, we asked again for water and she did get it promptly... then as we were eating I notice our watiress at a table somewhat behind ours, she was talking to the people at that table and seemed to know them, she was there a good 10 minutes.. checking her phone , texting etc.. There were 4 waitresses for about 18 guests, not tables of guests but guests total.. My wife said her steak salad was good, she had her dressing on the side.. my ceasar with salmon was ok, but way to much dressing on it..  They did not have draft beer which was surprising.. we decided on cocktails.. they were fairly weak..  Do yourself a favor and do not bother with this place.."}
{"text":"We were in town for the Cardinal football game.  We left the hotel and walked to district a couple hours before kick off.  We found most of the restaurants packed, with up to a 45 minute wait at saddle ranch.    We took a gander at this place.  Checked yelp and saw only one review, it gave it one star.  With the main complaint being no draft beer.  Seemed a little strange, a bar without draft beer.  We went in anyway, were seated right away in the farthest corner of the place next to the kitchen door.  Lots of hustle and bustle about the place.  Cute waitresses, little shorts and cowboy boots.  Our waitress swings by among the traffic of other waitresses headed to the kitchen.  I order a Coors light in the bottle, while I study the menu.  It's a pretty standard BBQ joint menu, a burger with pulled pork on it catches my eye.  Looks interesting, so when the waitress returns with my beer I order it.  My friend orders the pulled pork sandwich.  I grab my beer and take a big pull off the bottle and I am met with hot beer.  Not room temp beer like in England, but hot beer.  My companion tells me that the mountains are not blue.  I get up and find the waitress and tell her.  The waitress took the beer back to the bar then returns with the same beer and a glass of ice.  She told us that the bar tenders had got the beer on ice late so all of their beer was warm.  She recommended that I pour the beer over ice.  I had to tell her that beer isn't like a mixed drink, you don't pour it over ice.  I then ordered a coke as our food arrived.   My dinner looked appealing enough, a good sized burger with a heap of onion rings.  My companions sandwich looked fair to.  She tried to pick it up only to find the bun had soaked and fell apart.  I opened my burger with pulled pork to find, to no surprise no pulled pork.  We just decided that this was not going to get any better and ate some of the food.  The onion rings were good, the burger was at best ok, very dry.  Our check comes and wouldn't you know it, that f___ing hot beer was still on there.  I just want out of this joint so I pay the waitress with two twenties on a 29 dollar bill.  Waitress brings me back a ten and one, one dollar bill.  No change to use as a tip, I left the one dollar bill as a tip.  This place is lacking in management and training for its employees.  If your running a bar and are only going to serve bottled beer put it in the walk in fridge a couple days before you put it on ice.  Poorly run restaurant, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Whiskey and BBQ had my attention.  I ignored all reviews and gave it a try.  Food was a let down.  Ordered the two meat BBQ combo.  I chose ribs and brisket.  Brisket was dry and had little to no smoke flavor.  Ribs .... ribs were a joke (pic attached).  I got rib tips that were sold as \"ribs.\"  Had to pick around mostly cartilage to get any meat.  That's crap.  You don't offer \"ribs\" and serve rib tips.  I'm not a BBQ snob, but I'm a professional BBQ competitor and know when I'm being served cheap crap vs. what is advertised.  Bartender (bri) was great so I did not complain about the crap food."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend went there last night for Whiskey Girl's Night... because it seemed promising in the advertisement. First off, I was one of 5 ladies in this bar... it was full of older gentlemen (which is fine...but I was expecting a more upbeat dancing kind of crowd and atmosphere).  The waitress was sweet but couldn't seem to hear us very well and wasn't very knowledgeable about shots/drinks.    This place is suffering from a serious identity crisis as well, the DJ was playing country, then rock, then footloose :P No one was dancing. If you are going to advertise a dance floor... play music that people can actually dance too... just saying.  Guys also had to pay a $5 cover to get in, which is laughable once you experience what you just paid for.   The only reason I am giving this place 2 stars instead of one is that the food was great. I got the Berry Salad with Salmon and it was pretty yummy."}
{"text":"I almost didn't write this review because I didn't want to waste any more time on this place.  My husband and I went there before the Coyotes game tonite and let me just suffice to say, there is a definite reason why all the other places around had a half hour wait and Whiskey Rose was only half full.   Without writing a novel, the service was literally non-existent and the food worse than mediocre.  After paying 30.00 for two appetizers (that finally appeared cold and greasy 40 min after ordering), and a drink... we left the food half eaten, had to ask 3 times for the check, and proceeded to eat chicken tenders and fries at the arena that were 100% better than the food at Whiskey Rose.  Not sure whether the inedible food was the fault of the kitchen or the wait staff that let it sit there (we asked 3 different servers over the course of 20 minutes to check on it for us), but either way it was horrible.  My best advice is to wait for a seat at one of the other establishments around, because this place is a bust and obviously does not have staff or management that care to make it any different.  Can I give it no stars?!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed. Young male manager was very rude when asked about the yelp coupon. Ordered 1 drink came back and said they were out of an ingredient. Proceeded to order another and once again out of fresh strawberries. Mind you this is on a Sunday at 8pm. Ordered our food. It's was nothing special. Tasted like cafe food. Husband ordered the putine sandwich it was extremely disappointing. Super salty and mush. I ordered the Davi burger and it was literally a dry well done party with a bun. I ordered medium. Our waitress was nice however every time she asked how things were I would say okay. Not good just okay. She never asked how it could be better. Furthermore I was just disappointed and felt like my 50 bucks was a waste. Not to mention the staff was drinking on the job. The manager I mention earlier working Sunday night 3/5 at 8pm was drinking with some Buddies that were working. Very unprofessional."}
{"text":"We returned with a gift card that was given to us by a manager for a horrible previous experience only to find that at least this place is consistent. The food was Okay, service was soooo slow. Make sure whatever you order you like and do not need anything else because there is no 2 min 2 bite check back... well now we know. And don't order the slaw or pork."}
{"text":"I took my mother here to spend time with her. A friend of mine told me they played country music and that's right up my mother's alley. I have no complaints the people were nice , the men were sexy as hell, food was good, music was good and going there again tonight but with my friend so it will be extra amazing. I do believe"}
{"text":"They deserve a  0 star!! Horrible service. Server didn't come over to my table, I sat there for 30 minutes. May be it was color of skin or maybe she didn't notice."}
{"text":"WhiskeyRose on a Monday is quiet and slow, but the food, drinks and wait staff is still outstanding!  I love this place anytime of day."}
{"text":"So i finally decided to review all my favorite places in town here so lets have at it!  I have come here for awhile now mainly for the great food and relaxed vibe that i get whenever I come here. That being said what really motivated me to leave this review was a recent visit. I came out Saturday night before pro bowl to see how the place was during the night. I'm not much of a partier but I don't mind havin a few drinks every now an then. So I stroll up around 10 ish and as per usual there was a pretty lively guy at the door with a huge smile greeting everyone and asking people how there days had been and if they were ready to have a good time. Now from afar walking up you would prolly peg this guy just as I did upon first sight as a angry tough acting door guy judging by his appearance, full thick beard with a winter hat(beanie) and full arm tattoos. But boy was I wrong every time I have come here and he is there its always pleasant I'm pushing 50 now and because it's his job he has always asked to see my ID and I have no problems showing it. The funny thing is he will always crack a joke and call me young man after seeing my ID which really starts off every visit pleasant.    Well the buck don't stop there folks because when I got inside another gentlemen greeted me with a great big smile and asked how I was doing which I responded with \"great \" I presume he is also security hence the T shirt marked Security. So the crowd was very lively the DJ was playing a great mix of hip hop n country which you would think??? what?? but take my word the DJ makes it work and work great! ya know a lil something for everyone. So I ordered me up a plain ol whiskey and coke I mean come on the place is called Whiskey Rose so I felt it only fitting. Took a nice sip and bam like always the great great bartenders mixed me a fine drink. The night went on more people shuffled in and it really got jumpin the whole night was such a great time the mood was absolutely positive all night! I saw a few patrons who were asked to leave which is understandable it is a bar, but overall there wasn't anything that made me believe the bar attracted a bad crowd great people all night fun conversations and just plain beautiful people all around.   All in all I think this is just a great place where the service is top notch from top to bottom I mean hell even their security has the same enthusiasm as the bartenders and servers just everyone in the building is great!!! I can go on and on about the food but I'll keep it short I've tried maybe a dozen or so dishes from the menu and a slew of appetizers A+ on everything so go there for yourself pick anything off the menu and I'm sure you will love it! Last and certainly not least try one of the many ways they do mac n cheese simply delicious. I know no place is perfect or even close you cant please everybody but Whiskey Rose has been so consistent always good food great atmosphere and great people and its refreshing to see that. Go out and get some is what I'll end with!!!"}
{"text":"Nothing very special. Went there for a drink during bike night and it wasn't packed. The hostess didn't listen. As I kept saying we wanted a spot on the bar, she kept saying she could seat us in the dining area.   The drinks were good. We ordered the nachos and the plate was plenty full and tasty."}
{"text":"The service at the bar was fine.  We were waiting for a table outside, but since we already ordered food at the bar they wouldn't move our tab over because \"the waitress wouldn't make as much money.\" Really poor service. Would not come back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were out at Westgate for the Packers/Cardinals playoff pregame festivities yesterday and to watch the game.  We decided on having food and drinks at Whiskey Rose because it is (or should I say used to be) our go-to place when we are at Westgate.  We sat at the bar as usual, ran into a friend of mine and proceeded to have a good time watching the game and conversing with other patrons.  Neither of us was rude or obnoxious to any bartender, server or patron at any time and there were no issues with anything whatsoever.  After some time, one of the bartenders pointed at my boyfriend and motioned to the bouncer at the door.  My boyfriend was called outside and was told to leave.  He asked why and was not given an answer but was told again to leave.  None of the people we were conversing with knew why we were being asked to leave, either.  We paid our tab, did not leave a tip, and went to McFadden's where we were treated very kindly.  We will not be back to Whiskey Rose ever again.  It is one thing to be asked to leave an establishment if you are ill-behaved, but to be asked to leave for no reason and not be given one?  That is not the way you run a business and expect to have repeat customers.  We always run a decent tab when we go out and tip our servers very generously, so it is unfortunate for this establishment that we will be taking our business elsewhere.  Oh, and the chicken nachos were disgusting."}
{"text":"Holy amazing incompetence. Went to a blackhawks game and hit this up afterwards. Ordered four drinks. About twenty minutes later the wrong order came out. My favorite was the crystal clear jack and coke that the server said she would bring coke over right over right away to fix. Ummmm it's impossible to turn a vodka soda into a jack and coke. Thanks for trying."}
{"text":"Doorman said you can't come in because we didn't answer the question right as he wanted. It didn't make any sense. It's too bad because it seemed like a good spot."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some food before it got too late, and was pleasantly surprised, my burger was great, and my friends mac and cheese was damn good. But the music had our head spinning, they couldn't decide on country, or some top 40 stuff to get girls shaking it on the bar...literally. left after they couldn't decide what kind of music they wanted to play."}
{"text":"What a waste.  Went here on a Thursday for happy hour.  Odd when we first approached the place 5 maybe 6 waitress were standing at the door doing nothing.  We pulled Our IDs thinking that was their purpose but it wasn't and we were told we'd be checked inside. So, we went to the bar and ordered beers and asked for a food menu.  The beers came out quickly but a good 20 minutes passed after several attempts to flag down the bar tender before we could simply order an appetizer.  When I say this, I mean we were literally ignored.  I even made the reach over/wave my arm motion I'm attempt to get someone's attention on more than one occasion.    The irritating part is that the ladies behind the bar were to busy reorganizing things to notice their customers.   We finally ordered an appt that wasn't good (avocado egg rolls.) Even Chilis has better egg rolls.  The last straw was when we asked for the bill. They gave just the the bill.  No receipt showing what we actually spent.   Ummmmmmmmm almost $40 for two beers and an appetizer. Thanks for the kiltlifter but no thanks."}
{"text":"Gf had the buffalo chicken salad. She loved it. Said it was one of the best salads she has had.  I got the brisket sandwich. It was very good. I had a hard time deciding what to get, everything looks good. I liked it very much but it didn't have very much BBQ sauce on it. If u order it get more sauce to add to it. Other than that I recommend it."}
{"text":"AMAZING service.  AWESOME food.  Would highly recommended and will go again when I am on that side of town."}
{"text":"Tight medium sized bar with indoor outdoor and dance floor inside. Located in Westgate so much to view and do. Another place that is fun even on hump day."}
{"text":"This is one of a few only bar/restaurants at Westgate that has it together on busy event nights.  The food is good and the staff has always been great.  My only concern is as a Coyotes season ticket holder I was given a Westgate VIP card that Whiskey Rose participates in and I am suppose to get 20% off but every bartender and/or server I have shown this card to is dumbfounded or says is ti not good on game nights.  Well, I do not go Westgate unless for a Coyotes game or concert...."}
{"text":"We were just in stadium area over the weekend from Cincinnati for the Bengals game. Whiskey Rose was by far the best bar we went to in the area. Mie the general manager was great to us and educated us on all the local beer....we even bought some to take back to the hotel :) The atmosphere is chill during the day and more energy as night falls. Food is excellent anytime!  If you're in the area for your team's away game or for other reasons, make sure you check this place out!"}
{"text":"Don't think we will be back. Had a Groupon so we tried it out. Every restaurant was busy in west gate except whiskey. Thought it was odd but now I know why. Ordered pulled pork (dry) and rib tips (nothing but fat). My son got diarrhea on the way home :/  Service wasn't bad but there was only one other table to tend to sooooo...."}
{"text":"Went to WR in Westgate to support a friend in tonight's karaoke contest but had to leave before the contest really got started. We do karaoke all the time without problems; we go dancing without problems. The music was SO loud I could not hear my husband right next to me but, that was just the bar music - then that was still on when karaoke started so two loud musics of different beats playing at once and competing for the same \"ear time\" with the customers. THEN, all around us people are yelling at each other at the same table because it was waaaaaaaay too loud AND... we were sitting outside on the patio... imagine being inside! Then we waited 49 MINUTES before we could get someone to help us so we could pay our bill (and we asked 3 other staff without success)! We both left with migraines! Never again!"}
{"text":"My husband insisted we go there prior to the hockey game.   I wish I had suffered through overpriced hot dogs and crappy concession food rather than suffer through my experience at this place.   My salad had about 6 pieces of lettuce in it, and some were slimy. Considering a 40 minute wait to get in, there shouldn't have been anything slimy coming out of that kitchen.   My friend's burger was a hockey puck. I suppose it was appropriate considering we were going to the game anyway."}
{"text":"I would give zero if it was allowed, place is a joke, no service, food was cold. I realize its fairly busy because of the location in Westgate but there are better places to spend your money and this is not one."}
{"text":"Met there before a game.  A tall drink is an understatement.  Pretty good as it is what to expect from a westgate bar.  Very loud not a good place to go if you want to have conversations.  I'd go again good burgers and brisket was nice and tender!"}
{"text":"Dear reviewers reading, Very relax chill place to hang out at. It was my first time going or doing anything since turning 21 and I gotta say it was the most fun ever. The DJ was very good and they were doing karaoke later in the night. There was a decent crowd for Sunday night the bartenders were so nice and I'm new to alcohol they whipped me up something nice and very tasty. I didn't get the lady's name but she had blonde hair and was the one helping me choose. And Travis was helping her they were very attentive to people. This was a very fun experience. I love this place! I don't understand why so many bad reviews?"}
{"text":"Pulled pork was absolutely amazing! We also had the corn bread and sweet potato fries and they were equally as good! I had the AZ peach tea as well which I would definitely order again."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both times it was great. Food is quite delicious and atmosphere is nice and fun. The wait staff has also always been very nice."}
{"text":"Wow.  What a suck place.    We were greeted by a friendly host who brought us water and sat us.  He gave us the name of a server who would be right with us.  10 minutes later no one had come by.  A young lady looked at us, I looked at her and she did a double take.  I'm guessing she was not a waitress as she was sweeping up.  She quickly looked at a waitress and pointed her towards us and said something along the lines of \"who has their table\".  The waitress was about 4 feet away from us and said \"I don't care\"  Well honey, if you don't care then neither do I.    So we left and went to the yard house.  It rocked."}
{"text":"1)No draft beer 2)No live band as advertised 3) Beer is hot 4)Over priced for drinks  Stay away! Don't do it! This place is not going to make it."}
{"text":"They honored the Yelp free appetizer with purchase! Came in before the Dodgers game. Staff was very helpful and friendly and the AZ moonshine drink was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch there yesterday and the food was really good - Southwest Mac n Cheese, BBQ Chicken wrap,and a kids meal. The service was great, everyone we encountered was friendly and helpful. We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I dined here on Friday night.  It was one of the few places at Westgate we has yet to try.  The food was pretty good.  The service was even better.  Our server (Stephanie) was friendly and informative.  And when I wasn't completely satisfied with my meal, she offered to make it right.  The manager also stopped by to talk to us after hearing about the issue and made sure we were satisfied when it was fixed.  I appreciate that they took the time and didn't just brush it off.  We will definitely turn."}
{"text":"I tried this bar out about a month ago and was very hesitant after reading the reviews. We were sat right away, and the service was amazing. The food was good, and the prices were fair. We had no complaints! We will definitely be back next time we are in AZ!"}
{"text":"I'm brand new to Phoenix and after coming here a few times I think I've found my new haunt. Decently priced drinks, they usually have specials going on, the staff is so great. I've only ever been here late night so I can't comment on the food but this place is a good time. The girls that work there are awesome. You never have to wait long at the bar. Even when it's packed I get served very quickly. The dance floor is kind of small but I've never had a problem dancing there. The girls will show you all the dances too! I met some really nice people there! Everyone that goes seems to just be out to have good time and not bother anyone. I also love the little lounge outside. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the music can be very very loud. Which I know is part of being out at a bar but it's just a bit excessive."}
{"text":"Night like life is great on wednesdays drinks are cheaper for lady's night and they do have best chest in the west! So guys come strut your stuff haha see y'all there"}
{"text":"We got here early on a Saturday afternoon and it was great. The service was great, the food was a lot so be prepared to share and the drinks were awesome.  We had a buffalo chicken salad, potato skins, hummus, bacon wrapped jalapeños and the blt were all amazing!!"}
{"text":"THIS IS NOT A DANCE CLUB. Management should take note of this because apparently they are under the impression that they are running a club, not a restaurant.  It was so loud, we were unable to hold a conversation with the people directly next to or across from us without screaming at the top of our lungs. This makes for a very unpleasant dining experience.  While the service was fair, the noise pollution coupled with the food taking an hour to come out ensures that I will not return and I will dissuade others from doing so as well."}
{"text":"We headed to Yard House and found a 30 minute wait so walked on down to check out the mall and happened on Whiskey Rose.  The manager Abe graciously lured us in with a free appetizer and I am so glad he did! We had a small issue with our meal and he personally took care of it will what I can only describe as personal pride of ownership. We had to find out if he was a manager or an owner. As someone who teaches customer service for a living, I have to say I was extremely impressed with the care and attention to detail. High five Whiskey Rose!  The food was good old fashioned BBQ comfort food. No fanfare. Yummy goodness.  It felt like family.  We will go out of our way to come back."}
{"text":"Fun place and good food! My boyfriend and I went right before a Coyotes game so it was SUPER packed but the service was still good and they got us out of there in plenty of time go in and not be rushed before the game.  I'll definitely be going back to check the place out when I have more time to hang out."}
{"text":"This place actually brought me back to Texas. Good food, environment, and the service was amazing."}
{"text":"We had lunch today with my niece and her friend.  The service was great!  The food was excellent! We all had different dishes and everyone enjoyed their selection. I had noticed the reviews about the noise level.  Maybe it gets cranked up at night, but it was an acceptable level for all of us. I had mentioned it when I made the reservations.  They did seat us at a wall table so we could visit as we hadn't seen each other in over two years. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Do not buy drinks from here! McFaddens gives you more for cheaper. We were going to bar hopping and we ordered a Fireball at Whiskey Rose. The bartender comes back with what looks like a medicine cup with the bottom barely coated and said, \"that will be (about) $7.50!\" Not even a \"want to open a tab?\" What a rip off anyways. Wtf?! We went straight back to McFaddens and had an amazing time and drank for way cheaper. Whiskey Rose has a great atmosphere for dancing or just people watching but if you want to drink, pregame at McFaddens. You probably won't want to leave them anyways because McFaddens is amazing! Probably not going back to Whiskey. ?"}
{"text":"Went on a date with hubby and really loved this place.  The Chive flags really got us ;)  Excellent service from arrival to departure.  I had a Jack & diet coke and a huge mason jar of Angry Orchard and it was enough for me. 3 will have you done!  Food was great- we ordered mini sliders and fried pickles.  We will return for sure!"}
{"text":"Whiskey Rose is top notch. The staff is amazing and I love the atmosphere. The bartenders are the best in the business. We did not eat but the drink selection and service at the bar was spot on. If you're in Westgate and want a spot to stop you can't go wrong with Whiskey Rose."}
{"text":"Great place and very welcoming of military as are all Westgate businesses. They have great food, atmosphere and staff. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Second update: The owner reached out to me once more; apparently the original gift card voucher was lost in the mail. However, he promptly re-sent another voucher and it was received. Thank you, Abe, for reconciling the situation."}
{"text":"Came for the free appetizer. The brisket quesadilla lacked enough cheese and the brisket is bland. Liked the Mac and Cheese and he liked the links."}
{"text":"This is a decent spot with great menu choices but laid out in a sort of screwy way due to the building structure which gives it a bit too much bar vibe.  Our waitress however is a goddess and super fun.  She wins the day over the food which was fine.  Bartender was super nice even though I didnt order beer, very cheerful as he pointed me to the hombres water closet.  When I say Goddess I am not exaggerating by the way. So women, if you are on a date you should stick over by the bar and stay away from the patio."}
{"text":"I hardly ever get to go out because I have a crazy schedule, so me and some friends decided to go to whiskey rose to try it out at westgate, the bartender was HORRIBLE!!! I shouldn't have to wait as long as I did for a drink, especially because it was a Sunday night and it was there were 20 people in there tops... Not to mention the drinks were horrible, I felt that she wasn't putting any alcohol in them, I had 3 margaritas and not even a buzz!!! Thank you for, we ended up leaving and going to toby keiths... my friends and I wont be coming back-not worth my money, me and my fiancé are really understanding people but the dumb blonde behind the bar needs to find a new profession because bartending just isn't working for her.  If I could give no stars I would"}
{"text":"Terrible service, staff, and management.  Ended up walking out after not being helped.  Asked the security guard a question and was given a bad attitude.  Sat down and ordered from two different bartenders and was ignored.    Do not come here.  Ever."}
{"text":"Just stopped here for lunch. Sat in the patio area, 3 different waitresses walked out there and tended to 2 different tables and not us! And the table that 2 waitresses showed up at to help, came after my wife and I. Total BS!!!!! And there was only 2 other tables with people at them.  No wonder the place was empty!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. Professional attentive server.  And of course great food as always. Car show going on outside. Very pleasant evening , we come here every chance we get. Tried fish and chips this time and it was great. Huge portions"}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had. The hostess never brought our menus. After asking twice we got up and got our own.  Wrong drink order final arrived 25 minutes later.  Food took an hour.  Manager said he would comp the food but we still got charged $78 for 3 drinks.... after asking 3 times for the bill we finally just paid the incorrect amount so we weren't late for the show we had tickets to.  Spent over 2 hours at our table total.  I felt bad for the server.  She was obviously overwhelmed with too many tables,  but absolutely everything was flat out terrible."}
{"text":"Got kicked out for no reason.  Don't visit this establishment. Security said I had to leave but gave no explanation. Will never visit this place again."}
{"text":"Usually the second or third time you return somewhere, the food goes downhill, but at Whiskey it keeps getting better. Finally tried something new and the BBQ grilled chicken wrap was an excellent choice. It was packed full of chicken and a variety of other tasty ingredients and was gigantic. The mac and cheese side was still solid and of course the burgers continue to be excellent. Those steak fries are worth ordering as a side as well. We also got a free appetizer by checking in on Yelp and the avocado egg rolls are quite a treat. Lots of cream cheese laced with avocado and scallions. The staff is always friendly and the managers always walk around to check on your food. See you again soon."}
{"text":"The chicken carbonara is great and the Mac n cheese is ok (needs more flavor) the atmosphere is cool, I love woodsy cabin look. It was clean when we went. The service wasn't wasnt, our waiter disappeared for 15 minutes and hardly refilled are drinks. Maybe the waiter had alot of other tables? Not sure but overall we enjoyed it and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"We live near Westgate and are enjoying the restaurants in the area. We tried out Whiskey Rose with a Groupon. It was crowded because a game ended. The nachos were a great value. However, it wasn't particularly outstanding in flavor. We also had the pulled pork sandwich was not stellar either. What was fabulous was the lemon drop shot rimmed with sugar. Suck on the lime and then drink. The bartenders were amazingly organized and multi-tasked with great skill."}
{"text":"Worst bar we've ever been to. We already racked up a tab of $200 when their girls were outside handing out 2 for 1 tickets. When my friend asked them for a card they said no...you 're already in the bar. When my friend said to us we r leaving,a girl had the audacity to to come up to our table and say,  \" i thought you were leaving\" in a condescending manner just trying to antagonize our party. We finished our drinks after being approached by several bouncers accusing us being disrespectful to their staff when in FACT nothing was said. Most pathetic bar we've ever been to. Never again!!!  To john t.....  There was nothing said between my friend and your staff. You can say all you want... You were not there. If someone feels the necessity to post on yelp, your staff was in the wrong.  Own up to it!"}
{"text":"We came here with our kids for dinner on Cinco de Mayo. They weren't too busy and seated us quickly near the back. Our server Was Lexi and she was super attentive and overall a great server. They had some drink specials including $2 Coronas so we ordered a couple of those. The food was delicious. My son ordered the Cowboy Nachos and they are huuuge! My other two ordered off the kids menu and loved their food. I ordered the fish tacos and at first glance I thought I would be disappointed as they served them on street taco tortillas. Hmm. But after two coronas they were probably just right. Flavor was surprisingly great but the fish itself a tad dry. My husband ordered the wings and ordered them extra crispy. They were delicious but oh wow were they spicy! Tyler (manager??) checked in us and asked how our experience was we told him great. He apologized for the loud noises behind us (employees took down some dining tables and set up a table for beer pong) we told him it was fine. It was nice of him to check on us.  So here is where they get docked a star...after the manager left our table we decided to order dessert after being asked by our waitress.  While we were waiting a young guy that worked there said \"By the looks of things it looks like you guys are just about done here. Just to let you know after 9 the kids aren't allowed to be in the restaurant.\" We said ok we hadn't been keeping track of the time. We replied when is 9 what time is it? and then fumbled for our phones to see what time it is. He replied \"you have 15 minutes.\" So when the dessert finally came I told my kids to hurry up and eat it because we had to go. We still needed our check. I feel like our server maybe should have informed us when we first ordered that after 9 it would be turned into a full on bar. As a paying customer I don't want to feel like I'm being rushed out the door. I was a tad irritated because nowhere on there website does it say kids not allowed after 9. (Suggestion) As we were leaving one the employees had a huge stack of sombrero's and gave each of my kids one. Which was very sweet and kind of made up for being rushed out.  Overall great service, great food, good music and good drinks. Will probably be back in the future..without the kids."}
{"text":"Sat on patio and enjoyed people watching. Had Whiskey Rose Torpedoes for appetizer-so much better than a jalapeño popper. Pulled pork dinner was great-pork was delicious as was the BBQ sauce (got some extra which it needed), fries were crispy on outside, potato-y on inside and coleslaw. No complaints!"}
{"text":"Bar service was excellent! Claimed our free app for some wings which were crispy and tasty. Bacon burger tasted great. Bacon could have been a bit more cooked but delicious all the same."}
{"text":"My husband & I came here before a football game, and were pleased that it wasn't horribly packed like most other places so we could get a seat. The inside is big and spacious, and they are going for a country feel (corporate country). They service drinks in big mason jars, which is a fun touch.  My husband got some brisket and liked his food a lot. It initially came out luke warm, but the kitchen fixed that as soon as we told our server. The service was very nice, if a little slow. The mac & cheese and cornbread sides were really yummy. A vegetarian could be very happy with a few servings of the mac & cheese, it's very cheesy and warm and satisfying.   They don't list beer prices out on the menu, which should be changed, but otherwise this is a good place to grab some drinks and food before a game."}
{"text":"When visiting Westgate Outlets, Whiskey Rose is a great place to go!  We had a terrific lunch here outdoors on the purely bucolic patio on a recent Sunday Funday.  Bloody Marys were on special and I love some NA beverage so I opted for one.  It came loaded into a Mason jar garnished with 3 jumbo olives.  Who invented the bloody Mary garnish anyway?  Clearly I owe them my life because those little appetizer snacks are amazing!  The mix was delicious and not too spicy, just the way I like it!  My friends ordered appetizers like deep fried mac n cheese and fried pickles.  I dove in for The Mesquite Biddy.  I was in love with this dish for the name.  It was a mesquite-marinated chicken breast loaded with barbecue sauce, fried onion straws, and chipotle Cole slaw on Texas Toast.  Yum, yum yum.  I had a side of the slaw and though the flask of additional barbecue sauce they brought out was adorable.  Great memorable meal with good friends.  What else do I need?  Woo Hoo!"}
{"text":"We came in for the PBR finals, and the manager was super accommodating and made sure that there was a TV that we could look at exclusively to watch them. The food was actually pretty good if you've never had the Fry's, that is something you should have probably best fries and the entire Valley. I won't give it away but they are super delish. I also had the steak which to be frank it's not worth 30 bucks, it has like some kind of barbecue A1 sauce and so I would just tell you save your money and get the Burger. A friend of mine had the burger, and it was okay, but I'd like to check out maybe some more of the options. The real draw of this places that they play stinking great country music, although they have a very small dance floor so be ready for that, not a lot of people dancing, but if you want to dance this is the place on the west side. The Waitresses were okay, I'm not too bad but I did run dry a couple times of my whiskey and my beer, the bartender at the front bar, was not very attentive and to be honest a shot of my fire jack cost me 9 bucks, if you are a true cowboy remember to sneak it in your boot. Other than that I probably would come again if I didn't really want to party too hard, as a country boy or if I felt like I could dance and not be too crowded. The snacks are legit, the nachos are good, come to have some beers and appetizers and you'll be great!"}
{"text":"Went here before a hockey game was outstanding service.  The food was very good and would return and recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Quick to seat, but 15 min wait for a server.  No white wine on a Saturday night!? Mold on the flat bread.  took nearly an hour for our entrees to be served and then the order was all screwed up."}
{"text":"First time visit great food amazing service!  If youre coming to weatgate for a sporting event this is the place to eat and if you couldnt get tickets this place has tons of tvs to catch all the action!"}
{"text":"We have visited Whiskey Rose on several occasions at Westgate.  Great BBQ food.  Atmosphere is good and enjoy the outdoor dinning area allowing you to people watch at Westgate Center.  If you are frugal they offer Groupons now and then for drinks appetizers etc."}
{"text":"Everything was great from the pretty hostesses to the awesome service and tasty food!!! We were greeted and sat right away and the server took care of us right away! The nachos were HUGE and tasted amazing! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It took the waitress a long time to take our order and the place was pretty dead. She then almost didn't take my order. She took the other 4 adults' orders and then started to walk off so I stopped her and told her what I wanted. We ordered the saloon sampler and when we received it there was no corn. When we asked the guy who brought it out (not our waitress) he explained they didn't have anymore but they gave us more fried pickles to make up for it. Normally when a restaurant is out of something they tell you and let you decide what you want so I found this odd and didn't like it. My burger was also very undercooked and when I politely said something I was asked what temperature I had asked for and had to explain that I was never asked. Even after having them cook it more it still came back a little undercooked but I didn't complain. I assume the manger saw and she took it off the bill. My husband also had to ask for a new plate because his brisket was really dry but he did say they did a lot better on the second time around.   To end on a positive note the fried macaroni was really good."}
{"text":"Very friendly place everyone was very kind and welcoming and the food was very delicious. The Ribeye I had was so incredible I know I will definitely be returning here"}
{"text":"Place is freaking awesome!! Great spot to eat food and also a great after hour bar!!!"}
{"text":"My mother introduced us to this fun place one afternoon for lunch midweek. We were only one of a small handful of tables but our server was great. I am surprised myself to say 'but' but there are so many times where you hit up a place that is a touristy spot on off hours only to be treated like you are invading their space. Not so for us. Our server was friendly, attentive, and very kind considering we also had the 2.5 year old in tow who just wanted to shake his booty on the dance floor. The music was fun, the food was tasty, and again, the staff was very friendly.  I look forward to making Whiskey Rose a part of my repertoire when visiting Westgate!"}
{"text":"We met some friends here before a hockey game and eat at the bar. I was very impressed with the speed of service received  with how crazy busy they were! Our friends had been there for a while before we got there and the bartender knew them by name and when we got there they treated us the exact same. I felt like I received personalized service as soon as we sat down with a huge crowd around us. We ordered some drinks and wings and had a great time before the game, will definitely return."}
{"text":"We came here before the Seahawks game to get a bite and enjoy the pregame events. Our server was good but they didn't have enough servers for a busy day. The food was also good. The torpedos weren't our favorite but the rest was delish.  We had a nice time but I don't know that we would feel compelled to come here again."}
{"text":"Unimpressed.  The staff acted like they didn't want us there.  5pm on a Monday.  There were 10 people in the place tops.  Waited 15 minutes for drinks.  Inattentive staff.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"We had a Groupon that was expiring so decided to come & check this place out. I started with their strawberry moonshine drink (crazy strong) & had the chicken fried chicken with fries & mac. My husband had their large appetizer sampler, they were out of pickles so they added extra wings which was nice. The chicken was just okay, the breading all fell off & the gravy was nice but I was so bummed to see fries really meant chips, they were good but not was I was expecting. I didn't love the macaroni either. The corn nuggets from my husbands sampler were amazing! We would definitely come back for drinks & appetizers but will probably pass on entrees."}
{"text":"Awesome place to be in Westgate. I went one time and it's amazing. The food, the drinks, the events, the works. Hands down another of Westgate's great bars. Go there and you will be amazed!!! I will definitely go back for me. One of my top 5 places besides Calico Jack's, Hell's Half Acre, and Saddle Ranch."}
{"text":"Such a great place for lunch or dinner. If you go during the week for lunch, you can't beat their $7 lunch menu. BBQ is really delicious and the portions are very large. Service staff is always friendly and the location is great if you are looking for a place to eat and hang out before or after a show or game at the arena or stadium. Get there early though because it fills up fast on event nights."}
{"text":"The food was a low C,the service was on a strong B/low A. The place itself was a qtr empty,so we got a sit on the patio. Music was at the higher end of the level,maybe so you can hear pass the other spots. The drink I had was made nicely,it was a nice blend and could of done another. If your in the area and need a drink,nice choice, however will pass on the food."}
{"text":"Awful.  Terrible beer selection.  Mildly passable beer selection.  Oddly condescending service.  If your local county fair is the vibe you go for, this place is for you.  Otherwise, go anywhere else but here."}
{"text":"My friend and I are dancing when a bouncer said, \"My manager wants to talk to you outside.\" We immediately knew what they were up to, but we complied and followed the bouncer outside. They were wanting to kick us out. We literally had less than 4 drinks all night and as we go to the exit the 'manager' said, 'you've had too much to drink and you have to leave.'  What? We had 4 drinks all night. We were dancing minding our own business all night in their club and got kicked out. We didn't do anything bad at all. I was teaching my friend how to country dance and we got kicked out. That's the last time I'll go into that place. I have a Groupon for their place. I'll let it expire before I go there again. We got kicked out for literally nothing. Don't go to that club, they abuse their power and will kick you out for nothing at all."}
{"text":"Overpriced, rude staff, & totally unorganized. Also a complete waste of time for their Halloween Costume contest that drew a lot of ppl in but not fairly ran at all. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Tuesday afternoon visit right after Christmas. In our group of four, everyone was incredibly happy with their food. BBQ shrooms was a good appetizer and our entrees included smoked chicken fettuccine, pulled pork, balsamic steak salad, and a cup of chili. Portions are HUGE! The \"cup\" of chili was served in a bowl, the salad could have fed at least two of us. Not only did we get a ton of food, but it was all delicious. Such large portions allowed for a lot of sharing, and everyone loved everyone else's dishes as well as their own dish. Corn bread, Caesar salad, and sweet potato fries were served as sides and they did not disappoint either. Our server was polite, efficient, and extremely helpful. I only wish we lived closer to eat here more often!"}
{"text":"Pulled pork burger and fries were great.  Got in late and sat on patio seating that faces the front walking area, great for people watching!  Had a nice Groupon deal.  Waitress seemed like she was never sure what I was asking for....napkin, ketchup, or bill.  Was a bit funny."}
{"text":"Ok, new yrs day, drunk after Ohio state won. But stayed up late, good music & dancing. @ 1:00 am best place to be at west gate without the cops involved. Men will enjoy the scenery, women will enjoy the.......dancing w/wo their partner."}
{"text":"Worst service ever...no apologies, no food delivered, had to cancel our orders after an hour in order to catch our show.  Do yourself a favor and skip this joint altogether."}
{"text":"Been here three times in the last six months and each time I order something different and each time it's great.   Me and my dinner guest have never had a bad meal. They have large servings at great prices.  No long waits for food. The service is friendly and attentive, which seems to be a rarity nowadays.  This is a great all-around place to eat at Westgate."}
{"text":"Whiskey Rose is my new favorite hang out at Westgate. It fills two items on my checklist which are: Good food and quick service. Plus it's literally steps away from the entrance to Gila River Arena.  There is more to Whiskey Rose though. It's got some character and they clearly support a variety of sports and teams, including the Coyotes. Plus there is a great patio for enjoying the weather in the fall. The downside is you're competing with the joints on either side who believe 'loud' equals 'atmosphere'.  The menu is still new to me, but I saw plenty I would like to try on my next visit, particularly the 1/2 lb. BLT. And even though there wasn't a lot of BBQ sauce on my grilled chicken sandwich, I could tell the sauce was pretty good. Plus, the jalapeño cornbread was amazing!  Because of the convenience, the above average menu and the great service provided by Kiley, I predict that me and my hockey ensemble will be frequenting Whiskey Rose in the near future."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. We went there to watch the ASU game on a Thursday night, as recommended by their Facebook page. Come to find out, they didn't even get the game!! The servers said they would keep turning it on since the minute we walked in.. Took our food and drink orders, then to find out they didn't get that channel. Bullshit.. Can we say FALSE ADVERTISING!???"}
{"text":"Service was great! One of the managers, Megan, took good care of us and the food was great! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place, Decided to eat here before a Coyotes game. We have eaten at many other places at WestGate before. And I can truly say that this is one of the better ones. Wife and I shared a burger. Wife wanted it well done, it came back medium rare. That was a good thing for me since I like my burgers rare. I thought the burger was very good, since it wasn't burnt(well done) it had a very good flavor. Not much on the fries. To salty and greasy. We also shared the jalapeno torpedoes.This is a Jalapeno stuffed with pulled pork, cream cheese, wrapped in bacon. Very good. Service was good, very nice. Prices are fine. Now it seems like they are not sure what they should wear? Almost like they can wear what every they want, as long it's black. Waitresses where wearing shorts, paints, t-shirt, or a collard shirt. some were actually wearing their jacket around their waste.  Anyway, I still liked it enough to come back on my next visit."}
{"text":"Damn what do I say about this team. They have some great atmosphere. Maybe it's because I'm from CA and I am not used to people judging me for being gay, it surprised me.   Trying to separate that out from the food... I mean they try. I think they are good people.  I'm just not sure what to say. So I guess in fairness, the food was alright, could have been better, and the service, for most people, would probably be fine.   Um, for me, it made me sad. You know, I guess people have their rights? I honestly don't know what review to give so I guess I'll try a median review:  I think they are good people, but man.. would I go back as a regular dude who happens to be gay, ... no, I would not. So as reviews are meant to guide most people, and most are not gay, I guess I should give them a somewhat higher rating, and I had done that.  You can definitely go here and have a good time, depending, I think, on who you are...   So shit what do I say? Um for me it was 1, for most people, probably a 3.5?"}
{"text":"Came in and sat at the bar. A decent amount of time passed without a single bartender (out of 3) acknowledging us. In fact it was almost as if they were refusing to make eye contact with us. As someone who tends bar, I can understand if you are busy (which they were slow enough to goof off together and with the customers) but at least acknowledge my presence before I've been sitting there for 10 minutes without even someone saying that they will be there to help me.  Got up and went to Calico Jacks next door and the service was fantastic."}
{"text":"Great service and great food!!! John and his team did a phenomenal job taking care of our large party!!! We will be back every time we are in town! Thank you for the great memories!!!! More than s 5 star place!"}
{"text":"Just went to bike night at westgate.  Stopped by whiskey rose and had wings and fries.  Hannah was our server she was a real sweetheart.  Great service with a smile.  She made my night.  Will be back."}
{"text":"If you are looking for bottom of the barrel skanks and fat, sweaty old men then this is the place to go! With the DJ tempting me in with top 40 country music we walked through a field of cigarette smoke to a packed bar. Upon first look it seemed like an amiable enough place. After waiting for 10 min for a male bartender to take notice I practically jumped up and down on the bar next to the men he just served only for him to turn around and take a mans order on the other side of the bar.  After I got my drink they played maybe 2 more country songs then all top 40 dance music ala Jason Derulo. Not what I signed up for. I'm all for that music but I'm IN A COUNTRY BAR!   The only redeeming qualities is they have good drinks, albeit I drink whiskey on rocks.. Not much to screw up. Also they had an MMA fight on so that bodes well with me.  I don't know where they missed the mark. The ambiance is nice. Clean and well maintained and stylish. I think the biggest strike against it is the DJ and their idea of attracting a crowd is by exploiting women having them do blow job shots on command. Seriously I'd like to think women are more evolved than that. You are not attracting women (especially those who spend real money in bars/clubs) with these kinds of antics. And anyone who knows anything about running a bar knows that women are your core demographic. Get the women to your bar and men will follow.  So I say shame on you Whiskey Rose, you seem better than this and I think with a change in management you could exceed the business you do now.  Let me know when you get you shit together Whiskey Rose and we will talk. Until then so fucking long."}
{"text":"Awesome bartender!! Very friendly and made a mean Tennessee Honey & Pepsi with lime!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great food and music here! It's probably one of my new favorite places to come to inside Westgate now!  I really like the fact that they have a live band here on Saturday nights! This place was really Poppin one Saturday night when I stopped in with my husband. The band was awesome! The staff here are friendly and look super busy all the time.   I will be back soon! :)"}
{"text":"I was out this weekend at Whiskey Rose and not only were the drinks weak (I ordered a double and watched as they barely pored more that a single) but the bartender Savannah looked at me repeatedly over the 5 minutes I stood at the bar without ever asking what I wanted, but then as soon as her friends walked up next to me she stopped what she was doing to say hi and served them immediately. Even after that, she still didn't ask what I wanted, one of the other girls finally took care of me. Bad service and poor drinks. There are better places in Westgate to spend your money"}
{"text":"I had gotten a groupon for this place last week because we happened to be in the area and I was hungry. The place was mostly empty (thursday night) with a couple of DJ's blaring loud country music for a couple of people dancing. Folks sitting at the bar were watching the game with one extra passionate fan cheering, hooting, and hollering.   None of that bothered us, we just sat in the back and ordered out food. I got the cobb salad with ranch dressing and feta cheese instead of blue cheese. This salad is MASSIVE and tasted good but was a little too busy for me with too much going on - still great tasting though and I hardly put a tend in it by the time I was full. My husband had pulled pork (dry) with baked beans and macNcheese. The pull pork was on point! Dry does NOT mean dry, just leaner, but still juicy with just enough fat! Baked beans were good and the macNcheese were okay too but I wouldn't order them as a side again.  Service was excellent - friendly and attentive, had no problems using the groupon either.             Edit* 2/14/17 So, we went to Whiskey Rose a second time b/c we liked it the 1st time... The second visit was on a Saturday  and the place was crowed (as expected) but we were seated right away (we chose to sit by the bar this time). There was no DJ or life music. And this time the food (mainly the starter) and service wasn't that great.  Avocado egg rolls were cold - probably because they were served 5 minutes after ordering. While I like quick service, I like fresh and hot food better. We had to ask for utensils after the server gave us our avocado rolls. Husband had the pulled pork sandwich with with fries and a cornbread muffin - he liked it all. I had the THE MESQUITE BIDDY (MESQUITE MARINATED GRILLED CHICKEN / BBQ SAUCE / FRIZZLED ONIONS / AVOCADO / APPLE-CHIPOTLE SLAW / PEPPER JACK CHEESE / BUTTERED TEXAS TOAST) which I liked.  What bothered me the most was the I was able to watch the bartenders and servers handle drinks. Almost every single one touched and handled the drinks by the rim of the glass/cup. For instance - On some beers I counted four different people touching the rim, FOUR! No-one drinks beer with a straw, so the customer has 4 different peoples' hands all on their lips. The mixed drinks and cocktails at least get a straw to same a customer from funk but still...   It ruined my appetite after I watched 6+ people doing this."}
{"text":"I actually really liked this place. Food was pretty dang good. Service was friendly and timely. Great atmosphere. Fast cleanup."}
{"text":"I went here about a year ago and was really disappointed in the atmosphere. They play the music so loud you can't have any sort of conversation. I decided to try again for lunch and once again I couldn't hear anything my friend was saying plus the drinks are WAY overpriced."}
{"text":"Amazing Nachos, Terribly Loud And Horrible Hip Hop Music!  The cowboy nachos were outstandingly monstrous!  The ribeye was good, but a baby potato portion for some reason...  Getting the check was an ordeal... They were holding my card and took 20+ minutes after the second check request... Then they came with a check not yet run in the card and took another 10 minutes to get that part done... It was super busy but service didn't rock at all...  The music is what killed it here for us... We were on the patio and right under a crackling and squeezing malfunctioning at times speaker.... The terrible hip hop music made most of the patio crowd cringe and several of us asked if they would turn it off. Nobody turned it off and it would let out a terrifying squeal now and then the whole time.   When we arrived normal rock and country was playing at a reasonable level and then out of nowhere mind shattering awful sounds began pounding our brains until we got up and left...  I would have thought it was almost 3.5 stars if not for the music and nobody making the horror end!  The demographic seemed off for that music with more 40+ year old people than 25 and under...."}
{"text":"So we came out for the U2 concert and was looking for somewhere to eat and decided to come here since we are here most Saturdays for Nebraska football games (we are members of Huskers of Arizona and this is one of their watch sites). It was pretty crowded since the concert was across the street. We were expecting a wait.the wait was 45 minutes for a table and then another 45 minutes for the food. We decided to get a drink and wait. A couple who had come in after us was seated immediately. I asked if they had been waiting long and she said no they took them right away. What type of management works here, this is completely unacceptable and insulting. I guess only certain customers are the right customers. If you are a Nebraska fan, don't attend the football games here, there are plenty of other Nebraska bars that treat their customers with the utmost respect."}
{"text":"Long Island Tea was very good as was their Bloody Marys. Stopped in here with some friends that were visiting from Montana. A weekday so it was civil and ended up being a great place to get out of the heat and sit for awhile. Drinks were priced right."}
{"text":"Our waitress was extremely rude. We ordered the Ahi as an appetizer and then we each ordered an entree. She asked if we want everything out at the same time or if we want the app first. The whole point of appetizers is that they come out first, so I said we want the Ahi first. By the way, the Ahi is expensive an you only get a few slivers of it. Not a great value. And then we're waiting FOREVER for our entrees to come out. I finally asked the waitress \"Is our food coming out any time soon?\" It was like 12:30, they weren't busy at all. And she's like \"Oh I put a hold on your food since you said you wanted the appetizer first. Oops! My bad.\" Like she didn't even care that she delayed our food that much. She was totally the self-absorbed \"Look at me I'm so cute\" kind of person. I think her name was Lauren. I never said I wanted a hold on my food, I just said bring the app first because that's the whole point of an appetizer. Even if the food came out 5 minutes after the appetizer, that would've been fine because it doesn't take long to eat a few slivers of ahi. I never asked for a hold, and I was annoyed that she did that. Our food took a lot longer than it needed to, and she didn't seem to care of be apologetic at all. I wouldn't go back here again."}
{"text":"Waitress is trying to steal from customers -Can't believe I went here tonight for appetizers and drinks and when I asked for the check total was 59.51. I gave our Waitress Kiley J 40.00 cash and told her to charge the rest on my card. When she brought back my receipt to sign off I noticed that she only put in $20 cash and charged my card the remaining $39.51. When I confronted her and asked her about it she gave a measly apology and while next to the manager just pulled the $20 cash outta her pocket. This is disgusting behavior and she should be fired"}
{"text":"Weak drinks, there I said it. Country music atmosphere. Plenty of T&A from the staff though. Overall average bar nothing special"}
{"text":"Classic. You'd better have great corn mash with whiskey in the name. The brisket was cooked well, good sides, reasonably priced. Worth its rating. Excellent service, even with a broken hand (Mad love, Morgan) 10/10 would buy again."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service dirty full of flies go waitress or waiter cleans anything in the store I will never come back here again the food good drinks and the atmosphere is horrible don't waste your time don't go here"}
{"text":"Service was 6.5/10, food was 6/10, the restaurant was nice but acoustics where terrible people talking made it ridiculously loud and holding a conversation was almost impossible.  The BBQ was below par, if you want real bbq, head over to BobbyQ's."}
{"text":"What? No happy hour because the Coyotes are playing? From Michigan. Would not even have stopped in had we known. Too bad we won't even be able to rate food. Beer served in plastic?"}
{"text":"Wow. Bizarre. My wife and I were hosting 4+ couples for the Vikings/Cardinals Thursday night game in December of 2015. We walked to Whiskey Rose after dinner for some drinks. We were there about an hour when a new \"shift\" started. The new bouncer decided that we needed to leave. We were apparently trouble?! My wife (of 23 years with 2 kids in college) and I were somewhat forcibly escorted out (our party of 11 followed) because we \"needed to leave\".  It was unbelievable. We have been at a thousand establishments around the country, and have never experienced such a bizarre situation.  It was like the bouncer felt like he wasn't doing his job unless he kicked someone out. We all shook our heads afterwards to try to make sense of it. Seriously, walk right past this place! It's almost dangerous to go there because you could end up having the cops interrogate you after the \"bouncer\" kicks you out. Any response they have to this is going to be phony...please spend your money at a reputable establishment that is appreciative of your business."}
{"text":"I had low expectations going in but this place turned out to be a really great start to our night of Hockey watching the Coyotes play.  We had so much fun we wanted to come back after the game but they were PACKED!  Good for them.  They sell a good product for a fair price (considering the location) and have staff that still care about you even though they are busy.  If you are itching for a rocking good time, then this is a great place to kick off the evening!"}
{"text":"I am here with my bestie from Chicago,and he has had his fair share of BLT's in his lifetime. He says this was the best BLT ever and the sweet potato fries were the best also. He mentions how tough it is to get a good sweet potato fry.   I had the chicken skewers which were demolished. The corn bread was surprisingly yummy. Fries were battered and crispy.   Pretty surprising how good the food was."}
{"text":"My husband and I bought a groupon and checked this place out. Everything was very good and the bartender was a pleasure! The only complaint was that my Caesar salad had wilted lettuce. Not enough to deduct a star for, because we enjoyed our experience very much and plan to go back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are from Cincinnati which has Montgomery Inn ribs, so the bar is set pretty high! They met the challenge. Great ribs, fast and friendly service. Definitely go!"}
{"text":"Had some friends in town that were staying out by the stadium so it was my job to find a casual place for dinner on that side of town.  Went to Yelp to check out some restaurants and decided to give Whiskey Rose Bar & Grill a try based on the reviews and I liked their name!   Sure glad that we did.  We were seated right away, server came over immediately and took our drink and appetizer order.  She came back a couple times to take our food order but we were too busy chatting and hadn't looked at the menu.  Not a problem, she was very nice about it.   Finally ordered our food and it was very very good.  Large portions that most of us ended up taking home.  You will not go away hungry from this place.  BBQ was excellent and falling off the bone. Had a nice experience at Whiskey Rose and if I am ever on that side of town again we will be dining there."}
{"text":"Terrible service, especially with the door guy. I came in with a group of friends and we had drinks while waiting for my boyfriend to park the car. He was completely sober when he called me and was waiting for me outside the bar perimeters. And as i walked to see him to see what our next move would be, the door guy told him to leave because he was too intoxicated... As my bf tried to tell him he was sober and wasn't even trying to get in, the door guy called five police officers on him. I had to grab my friends to get out of this awful place that hires incompetent bouncers.  Won't be coming back and we are making sure everyone we know hears about this"}
{"text":"This was our first time visiting and we will definitely go back. The portions were very generous and the food was great! The cod was wonderful and came with a huge portion of fries. The wings were very flavorful and I could have drank the ranch, lol! I had the Mac and cheese with brisket. The cheese sauce was creamy and delicious however: I didn't feel like the brisket added anything to the dish. But I would still order it again:-)."}
{"text":"This is our go to bar at Westgate. My girlfriend, roommate and I have a favorite bar tender we always try to get when we go. She is sharp and very attentive, never been rude. The other bartenders are nearly as good. Beer is always cold and reasonably priced. Music is a mix of usually country and throw some edm in as well. Never much drama. Manager is great, we had an issue one night that he saw unfold. I handled the situation quickly and he asked the responsible party to leave and came over and thanked us for not letting it escalate. Best bar at Westgate. KCCO!"}
{"text":"Great place haven't really had much more than drinks here but still a fun spot and Anthony the bar back is killer should probably really be the bartender tho personality and the only one who wasn't standing around waiting for people but moving and working always great staff tho too even the ones on their phones"}
{"text":"Shock top and well drinks only $2 and open on Thursdays until 2 am on Thursdays and the bartenders are pretty fast on getting you your drink you ordered!"}
{"text":"Food and service was great, NO one informed us there's smoking  in the indoor patio after 9:00 pm  like I said food great without the smoke"}
{"text":"An much older crowd than other Westgate bars, which adds a niew sense of diversity. Country western/classic rock live band, cold beer & a solid menu that offers among other things, Westgate's best pulled pork BBQ was my first trip into this place on opening weekend. Tonight I had dinner and their steak rivals any Westside chop house. Each day features a special Mac n Cheese, the Tornado appetizers, and house salad were all served up beautifully. No band tonight, but plenty of various sporting events on the TVs. I don't think you could be in there and not be facing at least 2 screens. I am HARDLY a c/w fan but this place has a good vibe, solid menu and pleasant staffers who were attentive w/o being overbearing.  If you need a fun lol' honkytonk, or a place for a cold one before or after a Yotes or Cards game, Give this place a try... Food was WAY better than Toby Keith's and service was better too."}
{"text":"I got kicked out on Saturday night for looking like a black guy there was causing problems the week before. I got shoved 4 times 2 of which were right in front of the security guards by 3 white guys while trying to order a drink at the bar. They did absolutely nothing about it even when i asked them to. The security guard said I could talk to the manager his name is MARK out front so when I spoke to MARK he said YOUR FUCKING OUT OF HERE GET THE FUCK OUT! When i asked why he said Cause I'd look like a black guy they cause problems there last week. So if your a black male you will get profiled as a person that causes problems. Also security dosent care about your safety apparently its ok for people to shove you while at whiskey rose. security will do nothing about it except kick you out."}
{"text":"Came here right before a Coyotes hockey game.  Good Happy hour awesome location in front of the water fountains. .."}
{"text":"I had not been to Westgate in years so when I dropped my niece off at the Renaissance Hotel for her SuperNatural Fan Fest I decided to try this place out.     1st they have a great check in offer. A free appetizer with purchase of any entree.   I went with the fried pickles which were really good. My server was great. She answered all of my food questions and was very knowledgeable of the menu. I appreciated her honesty and recommendations of the different food items. My food was hot and cooked correctly. I had the Salmon with herb seasoning. I really enjoyed this dish. Their corn bread is super good too. It reminded me of my grandma's  corn bread.   When food can take you back in time you know it's good.   I had a great time and enjoyed some great food."}
{"text":"Stopped for dinner after shopping at the outlets. Alexis was the perfect server, attentive without being annoying. The chicken and the rib tips were just good, but the brisket was fork tender, melt in your mouth amazing. We'll be back"}
{"text":"This place has the best pulled pork I have ever had! Along with a great selection of Whiskeys, my favorite drink is the Jameson Goldrush! Go in late night for awesome drink specials, beer pong, great music and dancing."}
{"text":"Seriously. Extremely sweaty hot, dirty as all get out, music BEYOND too loud, bathrooms.. Stupid. No soap, toilet paper everywhere, nearly out of paper. Why?  Too busy being sleazy! I'm really tired of these lame ass restaurants with self deserving ass kids being too lazy to actually run the damn things. I'm not kidding, I feel like I'm in a Tijuana bar minus the awesome street taco smell.   Guess 39 is too old to venture the bars anymore, we're being pushed to the fail safe dark dungeon dive bars that are ironically.. SOOO much more comfortable AND clean."}
{"text":"We stopped in here around 8:30 on a Wednesday for a quick bite before heading home. When we walked in no one was there to seat us so we stood around looking in circles for a while before a gentleman in a security shirt came to seat us. Once seated we were asked to move so they could set up beer pong. Once we moved it was a hefty length of time before our waitress came to greet us. We ordered two beers and sat there without a menu (and beer) for a good 10 minutes. After we finally got our menus and ordered, the wait for the food was even longer. We ended up not eating until almost 9:30. That being said, the service was horrible.  The food was up and down. I had the chicken fried chicken and then breading had a great crisp to it and was nice and moist. The gravy was good, nothing special but decent. The mashed potatoes were bland, yet way over seasoned with pepper. Side of veggies, also not cooked.  I would give it another try, maybe during different hours though."}
{"text":"It's hard to find great food, quick service and availability near or before any sporting event but we scored on all three here at Whiskey Rose!  Friendly greeters welcomed us and we were sat within 4 mins.  The food was really delicious and portions are huge.  Chef came out to check on us and our drinks were never empty.  This is a for sure better than most \" pre or post game stop\" 4 star review for WR"}
{"text":"This was honestly the worst service I've ever had. Our waitress was horrible. We had to find other waitresses to get us drinks and the check. Probably the worst service I've ever had. Luckily the food was very good. Too bad the service was awful, definitely avoid."}
{"text":"Never going here and wasting my money, horrible service and treatment from the bouncers and management.   Me and my friend went here around 8 PM on a Friday, it wasn't busy at all so we figured we would get something to eat but the bouncer had to check our ID's, so we gave them to him and he was suspicious saying they were fake and all that, we didn't mind that he was suspicious since that's his job but after he checked them through a card swiper he called management and this guy came as well acting all tough saying we weren't 21+ and that we're dumb for using fake ID's. Being angry we just said we would take our ID's and go somewhere else then and they said no that they would keep our ID's and the only way we would get them back is if the authorities came. The manager said he would call them and after standing around doing nothing we asked are they on their way and he simply said no if we want them we go get them. So not only did he contradict himself and act like a fool, he didn't do what he said he would... So we went and got Glendale Police.   After they discussed things the officers talked to us saying the bar can refuse service to whoever and all and it was just a precaution, they gave us our ID's back! We understood but what made me angry is how foolish and aggressive they were behaving for no reason and I don't think they can take our ID's just like that. Didn't realize acting like an ass when we gave them no reason too is part of their job description. Hopefully no one has to deal with what we did but that's my 2 cents and this experience determined my choice of never going back."}
{"text":"Good drinks, good food, and great service. My friend and I showed up a little later than expected due to having gone to a Coyotes game. We were starving so before entering we asked the bouncer if they were still serving food. Unfortunately, the kitchen closes at 11pm and it was already 11:30. The man standing next to him asked us if wings would be alright, which of course they were cuz like I said we were famished. He proceeded to guide us inside to a table and put in the order. HE REOPENED THE KITCHEN JUST FOR US! :)) thanks John!! Very much appreciated"}
{"text":"We'd come back in a minute --- the place is clean, the service is killer and the food is pretty damn good.    We came right before the hockey Game and nearly every seat was filled.   We got greeted at the door and seated quickly.     We loved the service, everyone we dealt with was awesome and our food came out quickly.     Try the ribs!   They were outstanding.  Best place we've tried next to the arena.   The management here is obviously on top of things.   Love it!"}
{"text":"The Westgate go-to spot! Whiskey Rose has dynamic bartending coupled with tasty treats & a great westside vibe. Grown folks doing grown things - Whiskey Rose is where it's at!"}
{"text":"Ordered a steak medium rare, got it well done... Sent it back and got another well done... Spent $11.00 for a tequila sunrise, got no grenadine ($11.00 for a tequila sunrise?)... Waitress was never around... Will not spend another Christmas Eve there! On a plus side, corn fritters are awesome!"}
{"text":"OMG! Just had a glass of pinot noir brought to our table that was so warm I thought it was hot tea! When I kindly tried to let them know the first reaction was that it was simply at room temperature? the glass was cooler than the wine! They then offered me ice with my already soured red wine! Seriously? Kinda afraid to see what the food will be like! I guess this is why the one in Chandler shut down! So disappointing,  location was great and it was a perfect evening to sit outside and relax a bit update! The food came out and was actually pretty good! The manager came out and had a much better explanation... their ac went out so I'm assuming if we come back on a day that isn't going on the wine will be an okay choice.  He replaced my wine with a strawberry shine,  very yummy.  Worth coming back for another try!"}
{"text":"The brisket is fatty & not properly cooked, tough & chewy, I wouldn't recommend it at all, I'll stick to burgers from now on, they are good, their fries, aren't really French fries, they are more like homemade potato chips, I've tried the ribs, they are decent, check Groupon for discounts  Their beens are just plain old ranch beans, nothing special, wouldn't order again."}
{"text":"My husband and I was excited to see a new BBQ place open at Westgate. We started off with the jalapeño appetizer stuffed with cheesy pulled pork and wrapped in bacon (I forget the official name.) my husband loved them, but he would eat anything as long as it was wrapped in bacon! I didn't quite care for the stuffing which was pulled pork and cheese. it was the consistency of mush and really didn't have much flavor. To me, it tasted like spicy bacon. We both ordered the combo with 2 meats. I had the chicken and rib tips with onion rings and baked beans. The portions were HUGE and could easily feed 2 people. I really enjoyed the chicken. It was slightly smokey and the BBQ sauce was sweet and skin was charred. I did not like the rib ends, they were mostly gristle and bones. They were very disgusting to eat and got hardly any meat off of them, just to be fair, I never ordered these before so I'm not sure if they come with so many tiny bones. The onion rings were very good and tasted like a beer batter. The baked beans were not to my tasting, they were sweet, but overwhelmingly tasted like chili powder. They basically tasted like a really sweet chili. This place was a hit and miss for me. The staff were super friendly, although I didn't care for their \"hooters-like\" attire. I may be back, but have other favorite BBQ places in town I'd rather go."}
{"text":"This place was HORRIBLE.  Right off the bat, we were greeted with a not that friendly waitress. After ordering we waited a tad to long considering it was hardly busy. My boyfriend ordered a twenty dollar steak. First big mistake, he ordered it medium and or was easily well done. Not just a little overdone, it was completely well done.  I ordered the pulled pork. When she brought me a plate of pulled pork meat, I realized I made the mistake of not saying I wanted the sandwich, which I personally think I would specify if I was the waitress, but I apologize and ask for a bun. She proceeds to charge me two more dollars for the sandwich when I don't even have all the other toppings that come with it.  Now when I go to taste my pulled pork, it's cold. Completely cold around the outside so I have to send it back. Upon eating it it was pretty good. The waitress brings is our check not bothering to wait and see of we need anything.  After leaving, not even twenty minutes later my stomach was severely upset. I had to take pepto twice to stop the pain.  Biggest mistake and waste of money. Now I see why the place was dead on a Saturday."}
{"text":"Bartenders were slow to us and to make drinks. The bartenders seemed to be lacking basic fundamental skills of being a bartender. The overall service here was less than desirable. Needless to say the drinks were over priced. But then again this is westgate. Overall the customer service was atrocious and the staff was less than friendly. If you are looking for a good place to drink I highly suggest you look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch on Friday afternoon. Bartender - Terry was fantastic and great menu knowledge. We will be back soon . The manager /Ruben also stopped by ."}
{"text":"Good food. Went for Hot Rod night at Westgate. Wednesday night wasn't busy at all. Sat on the patio and watched the game."}
{"text":"Was at Westgate always go to Whiskey Rose. Ordered hamburger which was great. But menu says served with one side. Then why was I charged for a side. Waitress says they always charge for a side. Then why have the menu that says served with one side. YOU LOST A CUSTOMER."}
{"text":"We came in as a family after the Phoenix Comicon and found out the place was totally dead. There was a great coupon for an appetizer for free from Yelp, thanks! Our food was out quickly. They didn't check up on us a ton but we were still okay with the rest of our service. We will totally go back for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Me and a friend of mine decided to have get together and do dinner and a movie. We didn't really have a set location as to where we wanted to dine so we decided to go to a place that didn't have a long wait. Well, we ended up at Whiskey Rose!  We were seated immediately and had a server over to is within minutes. It was very spacious and not too crowded which I like. Occasionally we smelled a whiff of cigarette smoke coming from the patio but other than that pretty decent place.   The food was shockingly delicious. I ordered the whiskey Torpedoes as an appetizer and the buffalo chicken sandwich as my mane entree-- both were pretty delicious   As for cocktails- I recommend the whiskey sour with Makers whiskey    Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We came in because someone gave us a gift card. After a long day of Christmas shopping we swung in. Appetizers were fried pickles fried macaroni and cheese and rib tips. All were hot and super tasty. Dinner was steak salad (so very good), the brisket mac and cheese and pulled pork sandwich. So much food. Alyssa N was a wonderful server. A very positive experience."}
{"text":"There are hardly any good country bars on the west side.. and this one is the worst! There are so many people in the country dancing community, and guess what, we don't go there! Lower your jacked up prices and get a better DJ."}
{"text":"Hands down the best bar at west gate. Staff is friendly, food is out standing. They have amazing specials and are always packed"}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is amazing! You gotta try the brisket it's juicy and great flavor! The Mac and cheese is so good! Today had the burger it was so big and juicy! The torpedoes appetizer I had last night and they were also good! The ladies behind the bar are amazing always remember your name and what your drinking! They always have a smile and make you laugh and make a bad or stressful day better!  They truly no how to have fun and make you have a great time! I came in once and now it's my regular home 2-4 nights a week to watch the games on the many tv's and for dinner and drinks! Live music on Friday and Saturday nights are great! Also recommend checking out wed duck dynasty night every tv had it on!"}
{"text":"We moved to the valley 5 months ago and this is the first restaurant review I'm writing because we were pretty disappointed with our meal at Whiskey Rose.  First off, we sat on the patio and it was extremely loud.  We like looking at everything around Westgate but this restaurant is more like a bar setting even though their food menu is huge.  So it's a pretty irritating setting for a meal with friends when you have to YELL at each other to talk.  Second my glass of wine was served in a mason jar.  Trashy.  Third I had purchased a groupon when we decided to go there, and I couldn't use it because it was an 'event day' (aka there was a hockey game) even though we ate our meal while the game was going so we clearly weren't there for that. I didn't even know there was a game, so you're telling me before we go out to eat I need to check and make sure there isn't anything going on?  We ended up paying a lot of money for mediocre food (and small portions).  The worst part is I have to go back to use my groupon or just eat the money.  I don't like returning to the same place twice if the food is just 'ok'.  Whiskey Rose isn't a place I'd like to go back to."}
{"text":"Exactly what you'd expect of a wannabe nightclub/bar/restaurant thingy in strip mall hell... what with it's reheated food, curt bartenders, and a DJ that plays the weirdest mix of Garth Brooks and Pitbull. The saving grace of Whiskey Rose? Fiddy cent Coors Lights on LADIES NIGHTTTTT. No better way to kick off a business trip."}
{"text":"Great times on a Thursday afternoon!  Our waiter, Ruben was great. What a fun place, with a great outdoor patio and fantastic view. I would highly recommend this place. We brought our dog to sit out in the patio!"}
{"text":"Had tickets to Guns and Roses with 25 of my clients and called two weeks in advanced to make a reservation somewhere at Westgate.  I called several places that would not take reservations as its their policy not to take reservations when there are large events at the Glendale Arena.  Whiskey Rose was the only one that said they would take reservations and so I placed them for 20 people.  I called back a week later and spoke to a male manager and up'd reservation to 25 people.  He said no problem and we will look forward to seeing you.  When I arrived the hostess said that the reservation was canceled and they could not accommodate us inside but if we wanted to sit outside they could turn on some fans! (it was 113 degrees outside).  I asked for the manager and Mia came out to apologize but they could not seat 25 people and that the reservation should never had been taken.  I pointed out that it was taken and I had even spoken to a manager............why did you not contact me to cancel the reservation and give me notice?  Mia...said. we meant to but forgot about it and have just been too busy.  I was pretty adamant  that I have 25 clients arriving any minute and we need to create a space or do something to fix this.  I pointed out several options and ideas to move people around to make some sort of space...  Mia followed my recommendations and we were able to fit about 15 people.  It was a fricking  mad house.  I will never go back or recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here before setting out in Westgate for the evening.  We were immediately seated and were served by a fantastic female who took awesome care of us all night.  We ordered the chicken nachos as an appetizer and holy moley, they were enormous!  She and I could have happily shared this as our entree and called it good but we ordered BBQ as well.  We ate only half of the nachos before the biggest plates of food I've seen in a long time arrived at our table.  I had the pulled pork platter with cole slaw and mac and cheese and she had the rib tips with the same two sides.  It was absolutely delicious!  The only item I wasn't totally thrilled about was the mac n cheese, but that's only because I prefer Southern style mac (firm and can be cut into cake-like pieces).  Theirs is creamy.  It was good, but not my fave.  The cole slaw was awesome and the BBQ sauce that came with the pulled pork was sweet and smoky.  We were checked on by management twice while we ate and they were very kind and genuine.   ***TIP: If you check in, you get a free appetizer!  Our ridiculously huge and delicious nachos turned out to be free and we had no problem with redeeming the Yelp* coupon.   Service here is top notch.  The portions are ridiculous, and for the price you pay, I felt it was extremely reasonable.  Before we left, one of the managers gave us a couple of \"two for one\" drink coupons and invited us back later on in the evening.  He told us the restaurant became a bar/dance club in the evening and boy was he right.  This was the most packed bar in all of Westgate and we had an absolute blast!  We danced all night, met tons of really nice people, and definitely used those 2 for 1 coupons the manager gave us earlier.   My friend and I lived it here and we will definitely come back (for the food and the fun!)."}
{"text":"Came here to see a body art show. It was not a body art show. Two artitsts, one drawing a cartoon like figure on one model, we left before the other guy could finish. Was scheduled to start at 9 pm, didn't start until about 10:30 pm. Came with my sister, we ordered two drinks, beer and a mixed drink, it came out to damn near $20.00. We ordered wings (decent) and (fries) good. Service was average. I will not be back again, definitely a country bar (not the issue), just nothing about this place stood out as \"please come back, we want your service\" and no, they were not busy for a bar."}
{"text":"This is supposedly a BBQ place, yet we came at 6:40 PM to find out they ran out of BBQ Ribs???? So fat not impressed at all... Obviously nobody else is either- Place is empty!!! Will update if the option B that we are forced to order is worth cokning here tonight.. UPDATE: They found ribs and took care of us very nicely, even got an offer to buy our next meal which is not required, but very much appreciated. Service ended up being great and the staff is excsllent...."}
{"text":"Maybe this place is great on the weekends during party dance club time but it is absolutely awful for midweek restuarant causual dining.   I was looking for a date night idea and found a groupon for whiskey rose for $20 worth of food and drinks for $12. I thought we would give it a try for dinner on a Thursday evening. When we got to the restuarant, more so bar...around 8:30pm and it was awkwardly empty. The middle of the place had a huge open area where it looks like dancing may occur? No staff was present and we had no idea if we sat ourselves, waited to be seated or if they were even serving food. While the bf and I discussed if we even wanted to bother with staying a server came up and we had an odd conversation if they were serving food. The verdict was they serve food till 10pm but they really didn't want to do that and would prefer we sat at the bar. We got the hint very quickly and peaced out. I am very sad that I lost my $12 to the groupon I purchased but feel I saved myself a lot of money, time and patience by just leaving.  This place is listed as a bar and grill otherwise I would have never bothered trying to go as a restuarant where I could get food. Like Hell's Half Acre next door straight out tells you they are a bar. None the less we went to the Yardhouse where there were actual customers and staff that wanted to help you.   If you are looking for a nightclub type seen this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Its been awhile since we have been here. The good is always great and the portions are HUGE.   The first few times at the restaurant, the staff was great. These last 2 times we had the same waitress. Can't figure it out, but she will never talk to my husband, other than taking his order.   She brought me a refill, didn't ask if he wanted one, and his glass was empty....he was drinking water. She asked me several times if I needed anything, never said a word to him.   When we got the check, she put it by me, asked if we were still working on the nachos. My husband replied, no and asked for a box. She said ok.  I gave her my card to pay the bill. When she came back, she gave my card back and said have a good night.   I asked another staff member for a box, she brought it back and handed it to my husband. He said, see that's how normal people act.   If this was the 1st time, I wouldn't think much of it, but this has happened more than once. I tease him that she might be intimidated because he's a big guy. Lol. I don't know that her deal is, but if we come back, we won't be sitting on the patio again, since that seems to be her area."}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner and did not know there was a hockey game. Scored two seats at the bar before the place filled up. Had the ribs with fries and slaw. Good but the sauce was the star of the show. My GF had the Mac and cheese and it was ok. Service was excellent and the lady servers were dressed for tips."}
{"text":"I had always thought this place was just a bar, so we stayed away.  Then, we found out they're supposed to be famous for their BBQ.  Okay, so tonight (Sunday), we decided to head over for dinner.  The dining room wasn't crowded at all.  We were greeted immediately, and our drinks were brought to us within a few minutes.  We ordered an appetizer, the potato skins, but didn't want the chili on top of them.  No problem, and they were really good!  Hubby went with the ribs, with slaw and mac n'cheese.  I chose the brisket, with a salad and cornbread w/honey butter.  OMG!  Everything was so tasty and delicious.  My salad came before the meal, and it was cold and crisp...very refreshing.  Our meals were so wonderful.  Hubby's ribs literally fell off the bone, his mac n'cheese was really cheesy and he seemed to really enjoy his cole slaw.  My brisket was tender and moist, the BBQ sauce is sweet (which I love!) and the cornbread w/honey butter was so good!!  We also decided to get a dessert, the Ghirardelli brownie with ice cream.  I was pretty full, but had to try some of the brownie...sinful!  The service was also worth the 5 stars.  We were visited a few times by the manager, who also assisted with taking empty plates and making sure everything was okay.  And, our waitress, Taylor, was very attentive, as well as knowledgeable about the food/menu.  We had a few questions, since it was our first time, and she was able to answer all of them.  Overall, this was a delicious and pleasant experience.  This is definitely just the first of many visits.  I can't wait to try some more things on their menu."}
{"text":"Stopped in before the hockey game against the Blackhawks. Place was slammed and we were  able to get a table after 30 min. We ordered the BBQ chic wrap and onion rings. Food was slow coming out,but being as busy as they were I can understand. However, when it did come the onion rings were cold. Wrap was good and had some nice flavor. The server came around and asked us if everything was ok and I told her about the onion rings and she said she would swop them out. Never happened. When we finally asked for our check I told her that the onion rings were never replaced. She said sorry. Well, I'm sorry too because that's why places fail. Lame excuses like, sorry, only makes the customer frustrated and unwilling to frequent the establishment. You need to make things right and when the ball is dropped while attempting to make things right you really need to shine. In the case that didn't happen. Come back for drinks, maybe, food, NOPE...."}
{"text":"Been here a handful of times, awesome food! Drinks could be a little better but we just go elsewhere for those. Host staff seems to get overwhelmed when on a wait. We had a big issue with service on the evening of the 4/11 (towards the end of a Coyotes game) but one of the owners noticed it and we were treated like VIP's after that. Never had that happen before, where an owner stepped in to make things right and came up to us, not the other way around. Overall, our food experiences have been good ones and we will return!"}
{"text":"Thanks John T for making up for our not so great experience!  We'll definitely be back for pre-game lunch and drinks!"}
{"text":"Eaten here a few times after the Cardinals games but decided to drop in on a not so busy night. All I can say is WOW! Awesome food and the staff is super friendly! Will be back on a Wednesday for Ladies night for sure!"}
{"text":"At first glance the place was super relaxed and awesome for a Monday night. After consuming a beer on a visibly dirty glass (lipstick tar marks) the waitress laughed it off and said not the first time this has happened while she happily swiped my card. No discount no free drink, nothing. Absolutely disgusting. I don't recommend customer service where the blonde waitress with the cute butt is too busy talking to all of her friends and their needs. NEEXT!"}
{"text":"Don't question the drink prices. .. you'll get a \"THIS IS F'ING WESTGATE!\" response from a roided out kid behind the bar... then he'll tell his manager on you. Pretty awkward."}
{"text":"Good, solid bar food. I had a very satisfying Mac and cheese. They have a surprisingly good kid's menu. My little niece had chicken fingers and fries. She enjoyed them. The fries were like thick potato chips. Tasty. The BBQ sauce was delicious. The best part was the service. Hannah was WONDWRFUL."}
{"text":"Skip this place. All food (appetizers and entrees) came out at the same time and server just said sorry.  The food portions were large but mediocre in quality."}
{"text":"I was surprised to experience such great service with the place being as busy & packed due to MNF.  Despite the craziness we received good service. The buffalo chicken salad was delish!!!"}
{"text":"We went for dinner on a Thursday evening. There was a handful of people there. We were greeted and seated right away and enjoyed sitting outside with view of the colorful fountains. We were served our drinks  quickly and the server was very friendly. Our food came out in an appropriate amount of time and was plentiful and tasted good. I don't know ? why more people don't frequent Whiskey Rose. We had a fabulous time and the manager gave us discount cards for next visit. Very good experience."}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of town for the cardinals game and decided on trying out whiskey rose. When the bill came the waitress charged us for items and drinks we didn't order. Then she ended up charging our card twice. The food was pretty decent and the service was poor. We will be trying a different restaurant next time."}
{"text":"Excellent wait staff, excellent food, quality ingredients and very stylish food presentation.  Bravo to such an excellent job, will come back!"}
{"text":"In town for the Penguins game from LA... Service is amazing. We sat at the bar and every bartender were on it. Meagan made everything happen!!!! I wanted the chili Mac and cheese which was not on the menu and she made it happen! I had a coupon for checking in on Yelp, they don't accept them on game days BUT she made it happen! Last, you can't take food into the rink so she held my leftovers at the bar and gave my boyfriend and I a free shot. Service does not get much better"}
{"text":"Came here the Sunday night before President's Day looking to party hard, and only Whiskey Rose could deliver. It's very minimalistic with the decorations, staff wasn't a bunch of jerks (like they would be at almost any other bar in this plaza), and people love to have a good time. Here's everything I like:  -Amazing karaoke. I had to turn around and second guess that a real person was singing Miranda Lambert, and it was not just a recording. We're talking talent that's almost an American Idol level. Wow. They didn't just do country...some guy was screaming into the mic on an emo track and patrons thought it was groovy. I like. I like a lot.   -Hard liquor. Hard liquor everywhere. This is the kind of place where manly men can show off and shoot \"moonshine\" all night. It didn't even break the bank. 3 beers and a Jack & Coke was less than $20 before tip.  -Space. Lots and lots of space to sit or stand. Patio was tiny, but if you need fresh air, it's not like it's far out of your way.   Not to say this place was perfect. This is the only bar in Westgate that does not carry beers on tap. Whichever beers that have in stock is also not made clear, and you won't really be able to ask over the blaring music, so just get a Budweiser or something. And finally, they were pretty gosh darn slow, as if the workers still didn't know where everything was. Is it that new? In any case, I had a good time and would love bringing back some friends. The competition to other country-influenced bars is very welcome."}
{"text":"Didn't eat here but did have quite a few drinks. It was picked but the atmosphere was fantastic. Loved the dancing they were doing here!!  Staff was talkative, friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Really friendly staff. There is a bathroom attendant in the already tiny men's room. Not very classy. Ten bucks for a 36 ounce beer isn't too bad."}
{"text":"I will be honest with you. I usually don't go to West Gate too often. Maybe once a year for a Cardinals game. Sunday was one of those days. I brought my son and his friend to the Cardinals game. Got to the stadium early so we can grab a bite at West Gate.   We decided to try Whiskey Rose. Before a Cardinals game every place is packed so WR was no different. This is a huge place. Eating outside and inside. We got an inside table and they have two room inside. One with the bar area then a back area. We got the back area. Lots of tv's with pro football on it. It was loud cause what do you expect from football fans.   So I ordered the Smokehouse Bacon burger with a side of sweet potato fries. Had to pay an extra buck for the fries. I thought that the burger was huge. Thick and juicy with a thick pieces of bacon. Bun was nice and soft. It was very filling but burger was okay. Not great. No wow factor but okay. Sweet potato fries were okay to. Seemed like they were really fresh and crispy. Good.   Since we checked in on Yelp, we got a free appetizer. My son picked the Fried Mac n Cheese. I was surprised that it came out in a ball but that's cool. Our waitress recommended ranch dressing with this. Said it really was good with it. So we got that too. It was really crispy on the outside with hot Mac n Cheese in the middle. Ranch really helped but the Mac n Cheese is Mac n Cheese. It was okay not great. Not bad but okay.   My son got the Saloon burger and he didn't complain. He ate it all gone. I can tell when he really likes something cause he raves about it after the first bite. Didn't hear anything from him. So I knew it was just okay and good. If it's not good then he won't eat it. So it must have been good.   The service was really good. Our waitress was very friendly and even made small talk too. So that was great. She kept tabs on us and made sure our water glasses were refilled. Food came out in a timely manner even though it was really busy that day. So I would give out waitress a kudos. Great service.   The funny thing about this place is that it's a bbq and burger joint. Very casual. Very cowboy-ish type of place with a bar and football. So when we walk into the restroom they have a restroom attendant in there. He personally gives you soap to wash hands and paper towels to dry with. Also, he has a bunch of supplies to buy too. Thought this was a little strange for a bbq and burger joint but oh well.   I thought it was an okay meal. Very relaxing. No rushing us out the door or anything. Food is okay. Service is great and we're there for a football game so it's an football environment. Very cool. Will I be back. We'll see next year. Maybe"}
{"text":"Our server was lexi this Friday night. She was wonderful and attentive. I ordered the avocado roll and the spitfire chicken skewers. Both were delicious!! I definitely wished the avocado rolls had a bigger dipper sauce portion though. Gave four stars because they didn't have blue moon."}
{"text":"This was one of first date night's with my husband since my daughter was born.  I was so excited to finally sit down at a bar/restaurant and have a good meal and drink.  We had the worst luck this evening because every restaurant had over an hour wait.  When we arrived at Whiskey Rose we were seated within five minutes...a telltale sign of the restaurant.  There was a hockey game going on so the place was packed.  Here are the pro's and con's of our evening:  Pro:  - Seated almost immediately and were able to have two drinks during our hour and a half stay. - Waitress was nice but clueless about the liquor served at the bar and couldn't even make a salad.  Con's: - After an hour and a half of waiting we didn't even get our food.  We would have been late for our movie.  Apparently all hockey attendees got their food before us, our order was pushed to the back of the line. - Despite the name of the place, \"Whiskey Rose\", they serve NO whiskey - Bartender service is extremely slow. - I didn't even get the salad I ordered after 1.5 hours of waiting.  Seriously, the wait staff can't even make the salads for customers?  We were EXTREMELY disappointed with the service here.  Management needs to take a closer look at how the bartenders treat customers and how the food is sent out.  We ended up scarfing down popcorn for dinner at the movie theater. : ("}
{"text":"My family visited here on a Monday evening. The place was almost empty, which was great for us. Service was solid, though not everything was smooth. My husband ordered a beer, and I tried to order a strawberry cocktail--but was informed they were out of the liquor. I guess the weekend drained their supply! I settled for water.  Our appetizer of Whiskey Rose torpedoes came out quickly and they were quite good. I can't handle a lot of heat, but I found the torpedo quite tasty... then found the spiciness right by the stem! Quite good nevertheless. I'd eat these again.  My husband had a Saloon Burger. It was cooked perfectly to his specifications. The fries were good, too.  Our son had the kid meal macaroni and cheese with fries. He quite enjoyed his food, too, and it was the perfect amount for him.  I had the rib tips with green veggie and cornbread. When I ordered, I asked what the green vegetable was today and was told it was broccolini. I was surprised to see a squash medley instead, but I liked it just fine. The rib tips were perfectly cooked, not dried out. I gave about half to my husband and they met his approval, too.  The most disappointing thing was the cornbread muffin. If you look at my picture, it's that dark, shriveled thing at about the 11 o'clock position on my plate. I'm guessing it had been kept warm under foil or in some other warm humid environment. When I tried to cut into it, it literally crumbled in my hand. The pieces were on the verge of being mushy.  I'd still try this place again on a quiet weeknight since most of the food was good and the menu has a lot to offer."}
{"text":"Walked in ... we sat at the bar. Bartender looked at us turned away to help a group of guys coming in from the game!!! Guess what?!? we just came from the game also!!! We got up and not anyone asked us anything after they saw us walk in.   Would not recommend this place to anyone!!! So disrespectful!!! Treat everyone the same ...age... color... and sex!!! If I could it would be a -10!!"}
{"text":"My \"go-to\" in Westgate.  It's not everyone's cup of tea, but the food and drinks are much better than most in the area.  If you're lucky enough to have Terry as your bartender, you'll be taken care of.  Mixed drinks are made well and he's personable!    Try it for Sunday Funday - can't beat their Bloody Mary and mimosa deals!"}
{"text":"I wish I had an option to give this place negative stars because that's what we had, a negative experience. Sunday afternoon my husband and I went shopping and decided to have a nice lunch and a few drinks, he suggested Whiskey Rose. We sat on the fairly empty patio and waited for a server. Two gentlemen came in about 5 minutes later and sat at a table directly behind us and immediately a girl came and gave them menus and took their  drink order, she didn't even acknowledge us. A minute later another girl walked out and right past us and went and asked the gentlemen if they had been helped and then again she walked right past us and didn't say a word. After letting it sink in for a second we looked at each other like wow that really just happened and  we got up and left. Obviously it's very clear these girls are trained to think that two gentlemen are more important than a married man and wife and to take special care of them before even acknowledging us. We will not be back. We will not recommend this establishment even to our friends or sons who go as a group of just men. For the record my husband and I are over tippers - to the point our credit card company contacts us regularly asking if we meant to tip that high. Your loss and another establishments gain I suppose. Your poor management in training and oversight will drive a lot of good paying customers away."}
{"text":"Stopped in because a neighboring establishment had a cover for St Paddy's day!  (Booooo). Food was average!  But the five stars is for the service!  Derek was awesome, very attentive, even on St Paddy's day!"}
{"text":"Extremely rude, horrible service really can't say anything positive about this location. Avoid it at costs. I can understand one or two people having a bad day but the whole staff.  One star is too much for this place."}
{"text":"This place seemed pretty nice... At first. After three beers I was told I was cut off. I was hardly buzzed, was not stumbling, And not slurring. Me and my friend even had a cab to take us home. I was a little annoyed at how the pompous \"bouncer\" took pride in how he can limit peoples drinks on a whim. Despite this I hung out, just to keep my friend company. Then one WATER later, I was approached by another \"bouncer\" and told I was over intoxicated and needed to leave. I said he didn't know what he was talking about and he said \" sorry you can't hold your booze faggot, next time go to a faggot bar.\" I was deeply disturbed by this level of ignorance and unprofessionalism. Not to mention I am straight. I'm serving in the armed forces and just wanted to have a couple drinks on one of the few nights I get the chance to. Do not go here."}
{"text":"Service was fabulous... and so were the drinks!  We sat at an outside table within the little patio area, on a Saturday night.  The \"entertainment\" of the evening turned out to be a bridal party that was just kind of bouncing around the plaza area near the water feature.  Dont think I ever saw them actually come into the Whiskey Rose, but they were fun to watch!  Atmosphere is great, too... although I did find the bathroom attendant a bit odd.  Didnt seem like the attandant kind of place, especially since she didnt appear to be an actual employee, but rather just some chick who decided to set up shop in a random bathroom, lol."}
{"text":"Terrible GM Abe. Waitress was providing terrible service coming by every 30 min and when no tip was provided for terrible service the waitress cut all of our party off. Even though everyone in our party had less than 4 drinks the GM Abe kicked our party out for the waitress's salty attitude towards not receiving a tip for horrible service. Both this place and Salt are run by the same GM so I recommend avoiding both and going to any other bar around the place to get your money's worth."}
{"text":"After the worse bar experience I've ever had we came here to grab a drink before the ducks at coyotes game. Completely turned my trip around. Can't say enough about the staff! So personal, fun and just great to be around. The food was great. I love to BBQ so i know my way around a rack of ribs. Their rib tip platter was awesome! I have never seen another place offer these so it was great to see them on the menu. Beans were a little salty for my taste but the mac was great. If you order the nachos make sure you have a buddy cause it's a big plate!  Update: post game they were slammed. Obviously. Didn't order food but every bartender/bar back/host/waitress was working their ass off. Seriously impressed that a crew can go from a slow time where they can joke and have fun to a slammed bar where all hands are on deck working their ass off. Kudos to the bar/hosts/kitchen and everyone else in between. But the supervisors and managers must be very proud. This was a great stop before and after the game. Hope they can keep it up."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time in ordering food.  Maybe it will arrive within the hour, then again, maybe not!  We came on game day, never was told after we were seated that the food would be over an hour to two wait - for 2 burgers!  We were overcharged for the drinks IMO, nothing comped after the server offered multiple times to have the manager visit with us - who never did! - so we paid our tab and left.  Unfortunately the server missed out on the tip - had the manager approached us in some way, we wouldn't have stiffed the server but the overpriced drinks were a disappointment to say the least and we wasted an hour and a half when we could have been at the Yard House actually getting served - and good food too! Will not return, not even for drinks.  For locals, this is a dump and waste of your time and money.  Tourists, have at it!  You must be what keeps their doors open."}
{"text":"Nicki our server was great! Very attentive; we never felt like we were waiting for her to get a drink refill or ask a question, she would pop by on good time to see if we needed anything. Sweet tea was real good and served in mason jars! Started with the jalapeños or 'torpedoes' which were roasted just right to where you still get a crunch, with just the right amount of cheese and wrapped in a thick slice of bacon. BOMB. Didn't like the dipping sauce; tasted like Big Mac sauce. I ordered the Santa Fe Mac N Cheese and hubby ordered the half chicken with Fries. The Mac came with BBQ pulled pork on top with green chile. Would of enjoyed more heat out of the chilies but I know they're out of season. Still, I enjoyed the dish a lot. Hubby's chicken was REAL good! They cook/roast it with a dry rub on the skin and give you a tangy BBQ sauce to put on it if u like. He would alternate just eating the chicken with the dry rub vs. dipping it in the sauce. Did I mention how much we enjoyed the music?! Loved the playlist! Start to finish we were sat and signing the check in 30-35 min. I don't mind the no beers on tap. So long as they keep the KCCO!"}
{"text":"Poor quality, small portions, and overpriced. If you're forced to eat at Westgate, avoid disappointment and go to Chipotle.   Mac and cheese was generic, jalapeno cornbread was soggy. Sweet potato fries came out after the rest of our meal and weren't fried long enough. Don't even get me started on the meat...."}
{"text":"my wife and i went here after seeing Thor 2 at westgate. the food was great,the service was amazing, they checked on our needs all the time. the decor is great too. it was our first time there. my wife had a burger which she loved and i got the buffalo chicken sandwich and it was really good too. and the potato skins are amazing too. we will be back there ."}
{"text":"Went here for a happy hour the other night. There were about 14 of us. Besides us, they weren't very busy. Got to try some pita bread with hummus--it was fine. My friend and I ordered the Hog 'N' Heifer (burger with bbq pork and an onion ring) and the chili mac to share. The burger didn't have a ton of pork or bbq sauce on it, but I enjoyed it. The fries were battered and oily. I was disappointed with the chili mac. I thought it was going to be a thicker mac & cheese with some chili mixed in, but it was more like pasta with watery chili and a layer of cheese on top. It was heavy too. My stomach was none too pleased after all that grease... However, the servers were very nice & attentive and were happy to take pictures/video of our group as requested. Don't think I'd return on my own, but another happy hour would be alright."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service as always!! We love coming here. We enjoyed the torpeodos for an appetizer and had the santa fe mac and cheese as a meal."}
{"text":"We stopped in after we saw TSO in concert. They were quite busy, but we were seated promptly. The GM was our server & he did a wonderful job of taking care of all our needs. The food was amazing...big portions & very tasty!! All and all, a 5-star experience. Thank you, Jeremy!! We will come back!"}
{"text":"Finding an incredible Bloody Mary now a days, that's spicy, strong, and served with great company is very difficult to find! First time in Phoenix we decided to stumble into whiskey rose on this Sunday morning and Kim Martin the bartender served me the best Bloody Mary I've ever had!! Hands down. There service provided was also exceptional!! We were stopping in for one quick drink, but because of her we decided to stay here going on 2 hours now and plan on coming back for lunch!!"}
{"text":"We came to Whiskey Rose during Football pre-season! Wow that was a mistake..  There were no tables available inside, so we just sat outside. We didn't realize that it was so hot out!!  We ordered water and cowboy nachos to start. The cowboy nachos were free from the Yelp free appetizer. That saved us $13! Score.  It took our servers so long to get us water refills.. We were getting pretty dehydrated out there.  We ordered the ribeye, with mashed potatoes and sweet potatoes for $28. Along with a shock top beer that was surprising $10.. What beer cost $10?!  So total our bill was $43 plus tip, which makes it over $50.  In my opinion, that was not what we expected to pay.  The worst part about our experience was that there were speakers on the ceiling and it kept playing spurts of LOUD music that was literally blowing everyone's ear drums out. It wasn't like it was good music either. It was scratchy and just out of tune. Everyone's faces looked unpleasant.  I'll give this place a 3 stars for okay food, but not a 5 stars for comfort and satisfaction."}
{"text":"wow, the bad reviews are weird...I thought the food was delicious!  I was at Westgate checking out the area over this weekend, and came across this place for lunch. I got a spiked palmer ..(very strong drinks here! yay!) Very nice and friendly waitress who answered all of our questions being out of towners, and new to this restaurant. she was awesome! great service and tons of TVs for sports fans. Great bar area, and awesome drink menu. the fried mac and cheese appetizer is amazing, must try. seating outside on the patio too."}
{"text":"We were worried about eating at Westgate cause all the Yelp reviews were so negative for everything.  We landed at Whiskey Rose and had incredible service, great drinks and a few good apps.  You need to remember there may be a short wait with all the hockey and football events but it was on par.  Just wish I could wash my hands in the men's room without an attendant.  Not sure why but I'm not s fan of that.  Try the Four Peaks Kilt Lifter beer in the mason jar!"}
{"text":"Service and food is above average and the bartenders are great!  This is my go-to on Thursday Bike Nights at Westgate."}
{"text":"I'll tell ya I've been to a lot of bars boozing, drinking so on and so forth! Even been in in the business! I've never seen a manager like Jarrett run his butt off and help a staff like him! He works just as hard if not harder then his staff! I was amazed to find out he was a manager! He wants to make sure that everyone in his establishment is having fun and he does a great job! Kudos to Jarrett and his staff just because of him I will be a customer for life to wiskey!"}
{"text":"Always for a great time. Drinks are on point and if you love country music, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch and some people watching on Sunday before the Cardinals Game.  The staff was very friendly and happy to accommodate our request to sit on the patio.  They had some great Sunday drink specials, $5 Bloody Mary's and $12 bottomless mimosas.  They also were running a check in special for a free appetizer so be sure to check Yelp the next time you go.  We ordered the Avocado Egg rolls for our free app, my lunch companions ordered a burger and the chicken sandwich.  Both were happy with their food.  Even though it was lunch, the portions were enough to feed two people.  I ordered the Pulled Pork Poutine which was NOT traditional poutine. The dish was more of an open faced sandwich with a slice of bread on the bottom, pulled pork on top, then a scoop of mashed potatoes topped with cheese, and finished off with gravy.  The dish was good, just not what I was expecting, especially since the gravy had chucks of carrots and celery in it.  I did enjoy the pulled pork and would like to try that on its own as a dish.  I also got the mac and cheese as my side and it was just ok.  Service was a little slow when it came to taking orders but the place was hopping because of the game so be prepared to be patient if an event is going on.  Our food came out quickly once we were able to order.  As I saw on other reviews, the music from this location, as well as the neighboring restaurants, can get pretty loud so conversation can be limited.  Overall, a nice place to stop in for some grub before an event."}
{"text":"The brisket nachos we're so good can't wait to go back and get more soon I hope"}
{"text":"Got into Phoenix for the cardinal game a night early so we walked to the Westgate for some beer and food. With all the restaurants there we wanted to try someplace we've never tried before. We got excellent service and the food was great. The corn fritters were to die for!! So sweet and totally yummy.  I had the berry and feta salad with chicken. Everything was was so fresh and beyond tasty. Really, one of the best salads I've had in a long time. My husband had the ribs and they just fell off the bone. We will definitely come back next time we're in town."}
{"text":"We stopped in while on vacation, while I normally don't like a \"Theme\" feel restaurant in a tourist area Whisky Rose was wonderful. Our server was great we ordered delicious cocktails, the cowboy nachos and we're super happy."}
{"text":"Great dinner again will come often the manger Abe And our server Terrance was very knowledgeable about the menu and he explained how everything was fresh and he was efficient on everything I will ask for his section if he is working next time I am in  both awesome. Can't say enough about the food at Whiskey Rose, come hungry!"}
{"text":"The service was super, I mean really good and happy.  Their was one little slip up that they caught immediately and as fast as it happened they were on top of it, the manager Jared came to make sure our experience was spectacular and even covered the mistake.    We loved it and will go back again and again.  MJB"}
{"text":"We (My guy and I) went on a Friday night and seating was quick as there weren't too many people there. One of the main reason we went out to Whiskey Rose was because we had never been and because the Groupon. The pictures of the dishes looked delicious so we thought why not?   I was very disappointed they did not serve draft beer so we got bottled beer. My guy ordered wings and I got the mushroom swiss burger. The food did not take long to come out and our waitress was really attentive (reason for the one star). The food: Wings came out on this huge plate making it look like a super small snack. My burger and fries looked like heaven. All though I cannot say that was how it tasted. Oh those looks were so deceiving. I thought \"Can one really mess up a mushroom swiss? I think not!!\"  I think my hopes were a tad too high this night because I was so hungry. There was absolutely no seasoning on my burger. None. Not even a little bit. I am not a big complainer of food but even after putting my own salt on the burger it did not help at all. I had my guy try it out just in case I was being a little on the crazy side as I do from time to time. He agreed, it was s***. I was so disappointed. So disappointed that I Yelped this! Oh man I can't believe it came down to this.   I would not return to this place just because the whole experience was very mediocre and I have a other places that I would rather spend money on."}
{"text":"Event night... The service was fast and friendly.  I was concerned with it being so busy but they have the process down.  They are so efficient they did try and take a couple of drinks that had a sip or two left of liquor (hence the four stars) but other than that I was very impressed."}
{"text":"This place is a little ridiculous. A friend and I came here before a concert mainly because the options of places to eat at westgate are limited and this one had a check in special (can't argue with a check in special, right?). The service was a little slow, especially for how few customers were in the restaurant. When we were attended to, our waitress was nice and helped us decide on drinks and food. We each got a cocktail, which are pricey for this kind of establishment at 10$ each. The cocktails were overly sweet, but not terrible. The best part was the check in special (order an entree, get a free app). We ordered their burger that has pulled pork on top and got their nachos with brisket ( I think) and bbq sauce for free (a 14 or 15$ value....sweet!). The nachos came out and we knew we were in trouble. The plate of nachos was bigger than my head....it was insane! The nachos were fairly tasty, but the burger was a disaster. The thing was too tall to bite and too wet for its bun (read: bun disintegrated into a wet nothing). I would not recommend that burger. I would recommend their nachos.... the plate is a steal, especially if you get it for free....but maybe invite 3 or 4 friends to help you eat it all."}
{"text":"We use to go here often but the last few times we had just ok service, until last night . The service was horrible!  Our waitress never checked on us we had to go up to the bar to get drinks and a to go box . I can understand if the place ia packed but it wasn't :/"}
{"text":"They are very attentive, we've had the staff visit our table 5 or 6 times.  Mac and cheese is always great here, good size portion.  Buffalo Chicken Sandwich also worth it.  Ask for Sunita, she's really sweet.  The only suggestion I have for Whisky Rose is to get the Wifi fixed."}
{"text":"So we went to Whiskey Rose two weeks ago and bought champagne at $75 a bottle. Went last night and it was $200 for the same bottle of Karat that retails at $40. The bartender was not attentive and a jerk. Ohh yeah so she claimed that she text the manager for the price last night BUT it was manager that we bought from two weeks ago. Hmmmm price gouging on a slow night. I see how WR plays, not falling for it again will go across the street and spend my $ there."}
{"text":"We enjoy this place a lot! My hubby and I have been coming here since they opened. The waitresses are pretty awesome, especially Megan!  We always have a great time dancing the night away, and their dj plays a nice mix of music, from country to rap etc. always to get people up and dancing!  Only 3 stalls in the ladies restroom, gets crowded quickly at night.  If you plan on visiting Westgate to have a good time & bar hop, definitely make a stop here. :)"}
{"text":"We thought we would give it a try again.  Stopped in after a movie at AMC to grab a bite for lunch.  Maybe 3 people seated at the bar and 2 other tables in the entire place that had people seated.  We get seated and a waitress took our drink order.  I asked for brunch menus and was told she would come back with them.  We got the 1 water delivered but no drink.  No menus ever came either.  Waited 15 minutes and finally walked out.  They were however trying to seat a larger party of 6 or so.  We left and realized we forgot our glasses at the table.  Walked back in 10 min later and our water and glasses still sitting there.  Obviously they never realized that we left.  Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"The manager John was fantastic to plan an event with.  He could not have been more accommodating and helpful.  Our group had a great time.  The service and food were fantastic.  The management and team could not have been more accommodating or tried harder to make sure we had a great experience while we were there.  The next time the Pitt Alumni Association is planning something in Westgate I promise you we will be going back to Whiskey Rose (especially with how rotten we were treated by some other establishments during the planning phase of our event)."}
{"text":"File this place under the \"it is what it is\" column.  It's a restaurant to support the stadium crowd.  It's loud, bold, and theme'd.    Not in the slightest the kind of place I want to hang out, but I really didn't have much to complain about beyond my own distaste for the place.    The food was really pretty good, they had a few decent beer options, and the service was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"This place exceeded my expectations. Service was great (granted we were only the second party  dining). We were a party of 10 and everyone loved their meal."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Friendly and the ladies are busting their ass. We came to eat before the Queen concert, good choice. The food was freshly made, good drinks. The place to hang out before a concert."}
{"text":"This place is the definition of below average. The second we checked in it was unorganized. We called ahead and got a reservation. They acknowledged the reservation but said they screwed up and we had to wait. No effort to correct the mistake. It only went down hill from there."}
{"text":"First I will say this was not a restaurant I selected, it was a work dinner.  The food was ok however it's extremely noisy and actually hard to hold a conversation with those at your table. The mac n cheese looked great and had just the right texture but there was no flavor, I can't remember the last time I had to put salt on my Mac n cheese. The chicken looked good however it was just shy of being chicken jerky - it was very dry.  Service was good and we didn't have to wait which was a plus."}
{"text":"I would like to write a amazing review about this place, because I swear I had a amazing time here. However I was two sheets to the wind... All I remember is chatting it up with everyone.. Drinking beer and dancing. I'm pretty sure I was two stepping to rap (yep it was one of those nights).  If your pretty tanked and want a place to finish off the night. This is your place! HAHA!"}
{"text":"This is a great country bar on the west side of town. I wish they played more country music though. The DJ kept going back and forth between Country and rap, which is fine but when I go to a country bar I expect that kind of music. The servers are SO friendly, and even the DJ was really nice and played songs people requested."}
{"text":"So this was our first time here and we were both giving it a try regardless of the already inconsistent yelp reviews. We ordered the queso as an appetizer which was decent besides the completely burnt chips. I asked for the caprese turkey burger but just asked to sub the turkey burger for beef. Remind me to never try to change something again!!! The caprese burger originally had a patty, mozzarella cheese, tomatoes, onions, spinach, balsamic glaze and pesto mayo. I got my burger and although it had the beef patty, it only had some cheese and lettuce on it.... nothing else. No sauce either. So I asked nicely again for the pesto mayo and for the balsamic. She proceeded to come back and give me barbecue sauce. I had given up at this point. My boyfriends sweet potato fries were practically raw and honestly we will never be returning here! Bad decision and many regrets."}
{"text":"This is one of my favote places to dine in. Great atmosphere, delicious food ( recommend the ribs ) and always happy fast staff ."}
{"text":"I'm from Seattle and came down to Phoenix to do some tail-gating for the Super Bowl and after the pregame party I attended, my night took a turn for the worst.   My group and I walked into Hells Half Acre immediately after the party and if you care to read about my God-awful experience there than please do.   But following that experience we found ourselves watching the game right outside WR's patio fence. The security guard there is the main reason I'm writing this review. He was tall and stern as you would imagine most security guards to be but he was a really great down to earth guy as well. I was so distraught from my experience next door and he let me vent to him my frustrations and made me feel like I wasn't alone. The longer the game went on the cooler he became and I had to thank him for somewhat restoring my mood after what had happened.   We were standing outside the establishment so I can't comment on the food or drinks but I will say that from what I saw, they didn't outsell their capacity. Just about everyone inside actually had a table unlike next door where it was tighter than a pack of sardines and it seemed that the rest of their staff was accommodating as well.   So Thank you Whiskey Rose for hiring security staff that doesn't feel the need to prove something and actually treating people with respect. On a night like last night, I really appreciated that!"}
