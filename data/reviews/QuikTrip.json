{"text":"Great QT, but more than once I've had issues with the gas pumps not working! Also, one that didn't work after I scanned my card. Went inside and they said it was all set up. Still didn't work. Next pump I tried took it, but gave me quite a fight and just wanted to bang my head on the car door.   Free air is good though...Good choice of stuff inside, fast staff like at every QT."}
{"text":"Love the staff. Professionals and very clean consistently. Clean restrooms too. Great service.  Great brand."}
{"text":"Competitive gas prices...  Always clean inside. IMO, it's due to the fact that they always have 3 people on staff, and one of them is always cleaning something. I know they're trained to always say 'Hello' when I walk in... but I like that. Besides, now that I'm a regular, they say my name. Great selection. The fountain bar is tops... Try this if you want the best chocolate milk ever: Get your cup (any size). Fill it 1/3 with the Frozen Vanilla stuff over by the coffee. Fill the rest with Hot Chocolate. Better than any caffeine induced coma ever, with just as much of a crash after. ;)  Sorry QT -- I couldn't give you 5 stars cuz you didn't listen to the email I sent in about the price of your 44oz. It used to cost me only $.97 (with tax) for my 44 oz. Now it's 1.07!? Now I have to walk out with all that change in my pocket. I told you I was good with dropping off the dollar (not having to wait in line btw) and letting you keep the extra pennies. That's was me trying to establish some good karma, and you pee'd all over that by raising your prices. Bring it back down and I'll give you that 5th star."}
{"text":"Great Service!!  And fast!!  Great Food for a Convenience store!!  Clean Bathrooms!!  I will always search out a QT before going any where else!"}
{"text":"I frequent this particular QT about 3-5 mornings a week, and have been for almost 2 years. It is always SPOTLESS and clean, the employees always greet me with a smile and a kind hello. Matt is usually who I deal with first thing in the morning, and he is always quick to get me checked out since he knows I am on my way to work, he makes sure I've started my day right before I head to work!  The gas prices are ALWAYS lower than anywhere else in the area.   Tons of drink options (check out the tea selection), coffees, and more snacks than you can imagine. Make sure to get one of their pizzas too, which are made fresh by the slice or whole pizza."}
{"text":"I never thought I would write a review for a gas station, much less be obsessed with one. This QT is clean, well-stocked and a great variety of treats, including a kitchen with blizzard-esque yummies, soft pretzels(yes!), smoothies, pizza, etc. We look forward to trying their ice cream sometime but do really like the pretzels.   Hubby is a fan of their donuts and sausages. I like the mango tea in the self-serve area and the peanut butter Rice Krispie treat covered in chocolate for a rare snack. They also have the best coffee. I love their low fat vanilla or their mocha brews. We also buy their bags of ice (an in-between of chunks and crushed ice). Gas is also cheaper here than many neighboring stations."}
{"text":"QT is my favorite gas station/convenient store in AZ. They are always well lit and super clean.   As soon as you walk in you're greeted by the clerk. Service is super fast. They seem to hire smart and educated people who know how to multitask.   They have so many choices on drinks, snacks and candy. You truly cannot go wrong with this place!  I go out of way to go to QT"}
{"text":"Instead of long lines, sticky floors and disgusting fountain drink areas, these guys are the exact opposite.  Every time I walk in there someone is always cleaning the floors or wiping down the fountain drink area.  I'm always greeted with a \"hello\" when I walk in the door.  My favorite part is there are no long lines and if there are they are very fast at checking people out so you are out the door in no time.   I definitely recommend this place for your everyday snack needs."}
{"text":"This place has pretty good pizza, get a personal made to order and you can't loose. It's surprisingly good for the money and a hands down good Pizza"}
{"text":"What can you say about a gas/convience store..  I like QT. Gas is generally better than competiive for the local area. This one in particular is in SC with lower gas tax so if you are in the area, you can save a bit.  Restrooms are very well maintained and if you are looking for Coffee or a snack, this place is a good choice. Depending on how long they have been out there, the hot dog/sausages can be very good or an experience you don't want to go there."}
{"text":"We stopped just for some monsters and snacks on the way to polytechnic for a rugby game and we were blown away by the extremely friendly and happy staff upon entering, paying and leaving. Definitely a very clean and well run establishment!"}
{"text":"Love QT. especially their fresh brewed iced teas. Sometimes I'll get their sandwich deals for lunch - a sandwich (not bad for convenient store standards), chips & fountain drink for $5. Not too shabby."}
{"text":"We love QT. And who'd think their shakes would be any good?? They give you a good amount at a reasonable price too. This QT is always clean and the staff are always super helpful and friendly. It beats any other gas station close by."}
{"text":"Being a newer QT, this gas station is considerably cleaner than most (minus that ran over hard boiled egg I saw the other morning). It is consistently busy and offers average prices. And now that a $3 car wash has come in next door, it makes for a perfect one-two punch for your car."}
{"text":"It is a gas station. Five stars for clean restrooms and short lines. Yelp wants more information, I guess they haven't been to a gas station before!"}
{"text":"Best darn gas station if you ask me! Even in the ghetto I'll stop by & visit the plethora of commendations this place has to offer"}
{"text":"Love this QuikTrip location!!! The staff is INCREDIBLY friendly and their personal pizzas/sandwiches/croissants are all delicious. You never have to wait for a pump and it's convenient in/out access."}
{"text":"Like all of the quick trips this is as professional clean and fast as all the other quick trips I just moved to this area and I don't go anywhere else for their pizza pretzels Frapuccino's lattes and gas"}
{"text":"Love you guys.... But the diet Mtn dew fountain is not as good as store 476. Correct that ands it's a 5 star review."}
{"text":"Busy busy busy QT. I am here frequently with work.. The staff are always friendly and the bathrooms are usually clean. They can't always help if some nastyass was in the bathroom before me, but have always been quick and responsive when I mention that it needs to be cleaned up. But, seriously, how and why do grown women piss or poop on the toilet? They are always out pressure washing the parking lot. And the  is always yummy. Order it fresh if ya have the time."}
{"text":"I like the QT. Plenty of pumps, gas is often cheaper than at other places and flows well (lots of places seem to have issues with that, oddly enough). And they say that the QT Kitchen has good food, though I have to admit that I don't know if I have ever actually been inside one.  This particular location isn't the simplest to get to, if coming from 77, as you have to go down, turn left, turn left, and possibly wait. So there are easier ones that you can find, and to make matters worse, that traffic can get bad, so you may want to hope you're not in a bind (or go to another station prior to the QT).  But still, it's not bad overall."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best gas stations I've been to. It's clean on the inside and outside! Gas is always cheap too. The staff inside is really friendly and they are quick at checking you out!"}
{"text":"Very, very fast service.  Very clean restrooms.  Excellent beverage prices.  Delicious grab and go sandwiches, good prices.  Good prices on gasoline."}
{"text":"I love having QT so close to my home. I give them an automatic 5 star rating, only because I am hopelessly addicted to their Iced Tea. I only wish they had bigger cups to put it in.. 52 oz? NOT ENOUGH! :) I wish I could run a hose from their Iced Tea container, through the irrigation ditches in my neighborhood, straight to my home. :D"}
{"text":"This is my \"go to\" QT for gas stations.  I've been coming here as long as I've lived in the area, and I really like it a lot.  The service here is quick and friendly, store is clean, well stocked and has an array of coffee, booze, smokes, and other stuff that any QT would carry.  Gas prices are fair, but sometimes their a few cents more then the rest.  They also have awesome prices on their big pops from the fountain!  hoot!  The only downside to this one, is you have a lot of riff raff that hangs out front from time to time.  There's a few homeless people, and some others that sometimes hang out front that can be a bit, well, annoying.  As long as you don't make eye contact, your good!"}
{"text":"Fast check out, friendly employee and clean bathrooms. It's definitely the opposite of a Circle K."}
{"text":"14 gas pumps. I like that! :)  Inside, it's your average convenience store."}
{"text":"It's Quick Trip, just like any other. No matter how busy it gets they seem to meet the demand and get people in and out fast. This is the Quiktrip I come to most often, I've never had a problem with staff, the bathrooms are always clean and almost pleasant. Like all Quick Trips, they have free air for your tires if needed, that's a major plus in my book."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Always clean and staff are awesome!  Iced tea is fresh and tasty.  Grilled sandwiches are great."}
{"text":"Brand new-ish location on the corner of Dobson and Broadway. They have a wide range of drinks, food and hot food. QT's are by far the best gas stations in the valley.  They try and keep the place clean and nice.  The cashiers are always hustling to get you on your way which I appreciate. Most of the time the bathrooms are not completely disgusting.  Get the QT App they have offers for free food/drinks!!!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm... cheap gasoline. I like it. My car likes it. My wallet likes it. On top of South Carolina being 18 cents cheaper in state excise taxes, QT cuts their prices down even further. When I checked the Gasbuddy app, this was the cheapest in the area by at least three pennies per gallon!  Easy in, easy out. Wide pump area.  Inside, lots of snacks and drinks in a clean and bright shop. I like QT. You will too."}
{"text":"My favorite QT store in the east valley! The CSRs are always kind, quick, and not creepy! They even take Apple Pay now... Just a really good deal all around. Love coming here and I'll even go out of my way to make sure I come to this one even if I'm right next to a different one. Even the bathrooms are clean. :D"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad customer service experience at any QuikTrip, and this location is no exception.  It's the 5 star of all gas stations."}
{"text":"This QuikTrip is one of the only gas stations in that area and that isn't a bad thing. Well maintained, always clean, 10~20 cents cheaper than most other places, and has a massive amount of pumps so I've yet to see anyone have to wait to get to one.  There's a competing big-name station up the road (out on it's own away from anything else) I can't find on Yelp for some reason and it's DISGUSTING - gas all over the ground, flies absolutely everywhere I mean hundreds of them absolutely swarming the entire place, and if you're doing more than getting gas and go inside it's just as bad in there.  This QT is absolutely the place to stop for gas out here especially compared to it's competition."}
