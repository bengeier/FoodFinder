{"text":"I mean, it was okay. But honestly for $7.50 a cup, it should be better.  It's fun to watch them roll your ice cream on the cold stones,but once you get past that novelty, the flavour isn't there to back it up.    Their menu is confusing. Is each thing an option? Do I start with a base ice cream and add toppings? Are the things listen in the menu just suggestions?  I was really unsure about how to approach the menu and to be honest, the counter person didn't do much to alleviate the problem.  I DO appreciate that they had vegan options,and maybe that's why I didn't think it tasted great. Perhaps the dairy flavours are good...    I ate half and chucked the rest in the trash. I wish they had a more reasonably priced smaller option."}
{"text":"I have no idea how Made by Marcus can constantly be lined up down the block but not this place. I also have no idea how the same people who gave Made by Marcus five stars and then less for Scrollio because of \"the wait\" can possibly be serious. There is almost never a line-up at Scrollio and yeah, there's a wait - but they are literally MAKING YOUR ICE CREAM FOR YOU. And all for basically the same price as a Dairy Queen blizzard - with one of their creations being more than enough for two people to share. I ordered a scoop of ice cream at Made by Marcus on a slow night and ended up waiting 20 minutes for it. I sure as heck wasn't watching it being made so I'm not entirely sure what took so long there.   In addition to watching your ice cream being made (which is fascinating!) Scrollio is like a small town ice cream shop. The employees chat with everyone, and it's got a great laid back vibe. The air conditioning in the shop is lovely if you want a cool down with your ice cream from the hot summer sun, or they have a lovely little shady area out front complete with a swinging bench.   And finally, the ice cream itself is FANTASTIC. There's only vanilla and chocolate available but they roll your favourite toppings right into it. It usually takes about 10 minutes or so, so if you're in a hurry, move along. But if you want to actually take a break and enjoy fresh made ice cream, then I'd strongly suggest leaving the Made by Marcus line-up and taking a jaunt down the block to Scrollio."}
{"text":"Rolled ice cream is what's hip and happening in our city now so a couple girlfriends and I decided to check this place out after dinner for dessert.  Scrollio is relatively new, so understandably quite busy. But made to order ice cream is VERY time consuming, and I'm kinda surprised that it hasn't melted by the time it finally gets to you.   Pros - looks cool (IG worthy), lots of options to choose from for toppings and big portions (seriously, share!) Cons - there are only 2-3 people working (read: long wait times) and the spoons are super flimsy  It was fun to say we tried it, but at $8/cup and having to wait around, it's a meh for me."}
{"text":"I stopped in with a friend after walking by a couple of times, and I wanted to see what rolled ice cream was all about. I got the pistachio, saffron and rose flavour and it was DELICIOUS, and the presentation was so cute! My friend got the peach and lychee flavour, which seemed really good too. I want to try all the flavours! The owner was so friendly, also, and you could tell his employees enjoyed working there! I live in the neighbourhood, so I will be sure to give more of my business to this great little shop!"}
{"text":"Went for a stroll on Friday evening because we all felt like ice-cream and none of us had tried Scrollio yet. Glad we made the walk.  When you get there it is a bit confusing where you order - other end of the counter away from the door so your aware. When you order you let them know what kind you would like, vanilla or chocolate ice-cream (you can change it up), and anything you may want added or left out when the ice-cream is made. Then sit back and watch the action.   They have 3 people doing the rolling. We went in when it was slightly busy, but think the wait can get really long when they are jammed with people. As it was we were there for at least 30min.  When it is all done you can pretty much add any of the topping they have for no extra charge. Graham cracker crumbs and 1/2 a doughnut? Sure no problem!  We all got a different flavour and spent the walk home swapping bowls to keep trying them all. I got the date one and think that and the strawberry one came out tops. Would definitely go again as long as the line-up wasn't too bad, cause the taste is delicious."}
{"text":"Guys working were really nice and helpful explaining the menu. The ice cream was delicious. The place didn't have the nicest atmosphere, it could use a facelift, reno and some nice decor.  Had a cute swinging chair in the back and an air hockey table. I got the Oreo and added Ferrero Rocher, it was just over $8."}
{"text":"Try the Bestani (baklava flavoured) rolled ice cream. Amazing! The staff working were very helpful and reccomended their favorites to me. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I remember walking by this spot a few months ago, prior to opening, and I was so excited to try it out! Rolled ice cream? It sounds like an Instagrammers dream!  When I came in, there was only one person working, and two people ahead of me. The process of rolling the ice cream and creating these treats is time consuming, so I did have to wait a while. I would never suggest coming here if it was super busy because it would be a long wait.  I ordered the Moreos, and while it was tasty, it wasn't as scrumptious as I had envisioned. Also, the price is a little steep compared to the other local ice cream places.   If you are looking for ice cream and entertainment (the employee working was very funny and talkative), then definitely try it out."}
{"text":"How some people below give it 3 stars is beyond me.  First time I went my gf was mad at me and giving silent treatment. Strawberry, cream and marshmallow rolled ice cream made me go from enemy no 1 to bestie.  Second time she came with and loved it.  Third time I had to try the crÃªpe.  Fourth time... Well that's this weekend due to my diet. You get the point.  Yes there is a wait. But they are literally making it for you from scratch. Can't complain about it not being fresh."}
{"text":"All I can say is yummy.. I ordered pistachio and pecan rolled ice cream as reccomended by the worker that works there.omg it's too good.:). Must try guys.."}
{"text":"Rolled up ice-cream? Really? .... YES! This is more than just ice-cream - it is pretty damn good!   They have very unique offerings that will tickle your taste buds. I tried the Bestami (Khufi) and Pychee - both were very good and would recommend strongly. The flavors are nicely balanced and intricate. Every bite is a unique blend of flavors.   It is a bit pricey but for the combination of flavor and workmanship it's definitely worth it.   Ambiance - 4.5/5 Eclectic & interesting.  Service - 5/5 The staff will do everything to ensure you are taken care of. Food - 5/5 A wonderful take on ice-cream (Will have to try their crepes next time) Price - 4/5 it is on the pricey side but worth it.   Will be going back - hope you enjoy it as well."}
{"text":"Ordered the pychee (lychee and peach), ice cream was bland, barely any flavour just tasted like sweet vanilla. The lychee jelly was also bland and the wafer it came with just tasted like sugar. When I got to the bottom of my ice cream cup there was a small black hair that was clearly not mine, gross. This place is over priced and not worth it, hence probably why it was dead. There are far better ice cream options in the area and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"A new thing that is trendy: rolled ice cream! Apparently it comes originally from Thailand  We had the very berry and the make my day Mia ice creams and they were both enjoyable. For me I preferred the make my day ice cream. So good. The very berry was also tasty  Service was prompt however I was annoyed because 1 person took our order while the second person took the order of the customers behind us. But instead of completing our order on the two machines (we ordered 2 ice creams), they started making our first ice cream on one machine while the second employee completed the order of the ppl behind us. SO, we had to wait for our second ice cream. It takes about 4-5 mins to make the ice cream. Why they didn't complete making BOTH of our ice creams, then work on the ppls order behind us I don't know but I was not impressed"}
{"text":"One of the friendliest staff at any ice cream location I have come across. Not to mention the incredible rolled ice cream. Simply put, it is the most unique and best tasting ice cream I have ever had. A MUST GO for ice cream fans."}
{"text":"This is a good place for ice cream and other summer treats! The owner is friendly and the employees are as well. It's quite pricy and for the amount of ice cream you get I wouldn't say that it's worth it. $8 is expensive. As for the owner, he's a nice man but he doesn't pay his employees which is why I stopped going there."}
{"text":"I went there today, 2 days after their opening. Fantastic! I got the ice cream that has a caramel base (I changed that to vanilla), with caramel sauce and macadamia nuts. Rich, beautifully textured, just fantastic!  I swapped the caramel for vanilla because caramel on caramel would seem to be rather cloying, but delicious as this was -and it was DELICIOUS- I think I might have it as the chef intended next time :) or maybe another flavour. Menu is gorgeous."}
{"text":"If you are trying this place out because you are VEGAN, you will probably be disappointed. Given that we have amazing creamy ice cream options like Coconut Bliss, or Ben & Jerry's (non-dairy but made with almond milk) and a bunch of other brands coming out, I would just wait until you can get to a grocery store. I tried both the Strawberry and Oreo Vegan flavors from Scrollio and found it icy/watery and just not very flavourful at all. And it's pretty expensive. Won't be returning... (and I'll save my 8$ for a vegan pint from the grocery store!).  IF you eat dairy; then the ice CREAM is probably pretty tasty and they also have crepes so you could really like it."}
{"text":"Im not crayz about ice cream but i enjoyed it here. They let you switch the base and the ice cream is nice and soft and the staff is super friendly. Only negative is the price. Its about 7.50, it should be 5. too pricy"}
{"text":"My late husband and I happened to park outside Scrollio Ice Cream last year. I believed it just recently opened. They had a girl standing outside giving out samples. Husband asked if I wanted to try one. I said sure. The sample was delicious. So i went in and bought something with pineapple and his was strawberry with marshmallow fluff. I loved it. The price is a bit steep. But worth the price. The girl did take long to prepare the ice cream and add the toppings. She seemed a bit confused and the other girl too didn't seem like she was sure what she was doing. But I gave them the benefit of the doubt that they had just opened. And they were still getting their bearings.  The owner was very friendly and talkative. He walked around checking things and we got a free drink as well.  But it was interesting to watch how they prepared the ice cream on that cold stone.  I haven't had a chance to stop in a try a different flavor. But I will this year. I recommend Scrollio Ice Cream. Be prepared for the price but relax and enjoy the rolled ice cream."}
{"text":"Some great flavors. We had chocolate Macadamia nut and Saffron Pistachio. Macadamia was particularly scrummy. Check this place out."}
{"text":"Scrollio offers a very cool experience of watching your food being made. What's surprising is also how well integrated the fruit/mixins become in the ice-cream, and it actually tastes comparable and even better than other gelato/ice-cream places. Being able to mix and match flavours, and the small collection of weird toppings make it a good place to experiment. The suggested flavours are all good - our friends and I tried three different kinds, and they were all fantastic. Highly recommend to try at least once! I'm definitely going back :)"}
{"text":"You guys. I found this place on UberEats and was super excited to try it and while it scratched the ice cream itch  \"A Date with Pecan\" was exceptionally bland. Even worse... when we were halfway through we found a hair!!!!! I mean - gross! Cool idea, poor execution!"}
