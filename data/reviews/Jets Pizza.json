{"text":"I'm from the Metro Detroit area, where Jets was created!  I order from Jets at least once a week, even when I'm traveling for work.  My biggest complaint on the road is that it never seems as good as the Jets around the corner from me.  Well the Concord location was totally different. (Not surprising after I found out from my local Jets Manager that the guys running this location are actually from Michigan!) They definitely live up to the Jets name and taste that I have grown up loving!  Their square deep dish with turbo crust (don't forget their amazing house made ranch to dip) is to die for!    The great thing about this chain is they don't have a chain feel. The staff called many customers by their first name when they entered. It just had the local pizza joint feel that I've always loved about my local location.    I highly recommend Jets Concord!"}
{"text":"Delicous pizza our new Friday night pizza, the eight corner is fantastic,great delivery gals and guys !!"}
{"text":"Shaking and crying. I graduated from the University of Toledo and I ate some Jet's in my day. Hanging out in my hotel room for business, mindlessly scrolling through the Yelp options and couldn't believe it. A JET'S in North Carolina?! I haven't had this pizza in five years since I left the Great Lakes. Don't let the \"chain\" title fool you -- Jet's tastes better and fresher than any mom&pop's option.  You won't be disappointed if you enjoy a thick crust like a proper American. No minced vague looking things that should be qualified as garnish on your pizza. You can easily identify every single topping on your slice and they aren't stingy with 'em either. It tastes like home. Get the Jet's 10 and be classic."}
{"text":"I would just like to start by saying welcome to pizza nirvana. Not like the band but of a higher pizza! Like seriously it's a little more than your average pizza place but man is it worth it! Like you can get your crust flavored in different ways, like who doesn't like options?! You can also get either a round pizza or a square or rectangular pizza however you would like to look at it. They offer many specialty pizza's however I like to create my own pizza. I like to call it The Grey's Anatomy pizza (red onions, jalape√±o's and pineapples with a cajon crust) tangy, spicy, and sweet. Just like our favorite #TGIT show. And while I'm mentioning my special pizza I would like to know why it is that the wonderful and benevolent Shonda Rhimes has given Callie a new love interest who is not that cute, her hair is uneven, and she looks dusty! While Arizona is still without love  very upsetting. But back to the pizza  seriously if you are still grubbing on your average Pizza Hut, Papa Johns, or Dominos than you have to try Jet's Pizza! And while your eating this awesomely life changing pizza be sure to wash it down with a Coney Island Hard Root Beer!"}
{"text":"Perfect pizza. Perfect price. Loved the serving size and fountain drink. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"It was ok. Not my favorite but comparable to other pizza in the area. Lots of bread, a tiny bit of sauce & tons of cheese with a decent amount of toppings. The pizza sauce is really good though."}
{"text":"This was the only pizza place I could go to and not feel sick while I was pregnant but it over all has great quality and the pizza and dough is always fresh"}
{"text":"Moved here a year ago, one of the worst pizza's I have had to date.  Would not recommend. Little Caesars would be better and I don't like them either."}
{"text":"Basically the pizza is exactly what you would expect. Decent, but not amazing, and I think a little over priced compared to other delivery pizza. The quality is slightly better than other chains though which is why it's usually my go-to for a quick bite."}
{"text":"This pizza is fantastic I ordered a medium sausage with extra cheese the cheese was luxurious the pizza was delivered hot this pizza is way above and beyond what you would find at chain pizza shops.   This is my go to pizza place in town"}
{"text":"ONCE AND DONE! This place needs new delivery drivers! And the pizza was NOT Jets quality! Won't be eating anything from this location ever again!"}
{"text":"Jett's has the best deep dish pizza EVER.  In all the times we have eaten it, everytime has been Five stars!!"}
{"text":"I ordered takeout from here for the very first time. Pizza and a Greek salad. The salad was awesome. Lots of feta and other toppings, and it's huge! I tried the deep dish pizza, it was just ok. I had pepperoni on top, and they were all curled up like they had been cooked a bit too long. Friendly staff. Overall, a positive experience."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza chain, hands-down. I always get the 8-corner pizza, which is two deep dish (square) pizzas in one box. Since the pizza is cut in squares, every pizza slice has two delicious and crispy edges. You can get the crust flavored (get the turbo crust, which is a combination of butter, garlic and Romano cheese) at no additional charge. All of the ingredients are top quality, from the cheese to the sauce to the toppings. I've had their salads, wings and sandwiches as well and have never been disappointed. I've always ordered ahead online and never had any problems. Polite employees, too. Give them a try...you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is worth it. I got the jet 10 pizza and it was very good. Get the turbo charged crust it's awesome I typically don't eat the crust but that I can do. They were not skimpy on the toppings. Overall I will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza online. Called after it was 30 minutes late and they told me it was on the way. Called after 2 hours and they delivered it to the wrong house. They apologized and said they could fix it and bring another but it would have been 3 hours. Decided to cancel order. Disappointed in how the whole situation was handled."}
{"text":"Either go to a pizza restaurant or choose another place or location.  The manager Katelyn Pate does not care.    Apparently she makes the pixmap and answers the phone and knows it all.  May be she should allocate some duties.  Our order was completely wrong and she wanted to either give me $5 off my next wrong order after spending 35 on a wrong order.  Or wait another 40 minutes for someone to deliver me the right order.      Delivery guy was great."}
{"text":"Best pizza around. Wings were good. Thick crust was amazing. Sauce was just right. We prefer Coke to Pepsi and they did not have any iced tea. Other than that it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Very good pizza- whenever our office has an opportunity to have a pizza party, we always call Jets.  The chicken Parmesan 4 corner is my favorite followed by the Hawaiian.  It arrives on hot and on time.  We never have any leftovers."}
