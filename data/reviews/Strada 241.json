{"text":"Went here for my birthday lunch with some colleagues.   I had the Zia Rita pizza which seems like a very popular option. It comes with \"nduja sausage\", fire roasted onion, and rapini. I have recently discovered that I really love rapini. Especially on pizzas and in Italian sandwiches. It adds such a delicious bitter green note and it remains firm unlike a standard lettuce green.   The crust was perfect Neopolitan style, chewy and thin. The sausage was very tasty, I love when sausage on a pizza is not sliced from a casing but rather freely presented around the za.  I'd put this pizza up against a Terroni, Libretto, or Piola pizza any day. Service left a little to be desired, it wasn't busy at all that day and yet it took awhile to be seated, order, receive drinks, and receive our food. Almost as though because it wasn't busy the servers were in no rush at all.  If the food is what matters most however, they are a great option in a part of town where Chinese dumplings, Vietnamese subs/pho dominate. If you're feeling like some casual Italian I'd recommend Strada 241."}
{"text":"My husband and tried Strada 241 last night and it was fabulous!! Service was outstanding, decor was modern and the calamari was outstanding. In addition the menu prices were fair, although the menu is a bit limited featuring only a handful of choices Nonetheless we will return soon!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal food, reasonably priced, great ambiance. Gluten-free available too! Just amazing.  Went with friends last night, and have discovered a gem. A girlfriend and I split the Salumi (aka charcuterie) serving for two - she said it was the best Parma ham she's ever had, I completely agree. Then we split a gluten-free Margarita pizza, it was excellent. Still feeling hungry, we split the Bucatini pasta with a simple tomato sauce and Parmesan. It was to die for, perfectly al dente, with a fresh tomato sauce. The ingredients seemed fresh, everything had a rustic, no-fuss style to it.   Wine menu had a good variety of Italian wines at reasonable prices.   Decor is minimalist, they have seating for all different combinations - we sat at the long big table in the middle of restaurant which was flanked by smaller tables for two people, and more tables along the perimeter. Next time, I want to sit at the counter to watch the chefs in action.   Highly recommend this place, can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"What a lovely surprise in the heart of Chinatown!    This place is divided into the more informal, cafe area in the front and the restaurant area in the back.  The high ceilings, exposed brick walls, beautiful wood floors, open kitchen and vintage-modern decor make it, truly a gem in this neighbourhood.  The staff are welcoming, attentive and very friendly.   There are so many Italian places in the city, but Strada 241 sets itself apart in both its location and unique takes on some of their menu items.  Fellow eater and I started with the asparagus (I believe they were fire roasted) and Olive Cured Salmon appetizers (resembled a colourful cole slaw).  Both were absolutely delicious in presentation and taste.   I had the Bucatani pasta and fellow eater had the Zia Maria pizza.  Again, simple, fresh and delicious.  For dessert I had to order the Chocolate & Hazelnut Semifreddo.  Oh my, I had no idea so many layers of incredible goodness could be combined like that!  From what I could see, most (or maybe all) desserts are served in mason jars, which is a great touch.  This one had a new surprise as I continued to dig down through the layers to the bottom.  Fellow eater just had the nutella latte, which he claims is incredible.  I am even considering returning tomorrow just to have the nutella latte and hang out a bit at the front to sample a pastry.  I may bring my laptop to make it look like I am doing work."}
{"text":"Venue looked good, wait staff very nice but food was not great."}
{"text":"I came by  for a coffee quite by accident. Meant to go to Dark Horse down the street but they were closing just as I arrived. I walked up Spadina and passed by what looked to be an empty fancy coffeehouse with a big espresso machine near the front. When I entered, it turned out that it's quite a deep building with a restaurant at the back half. The floor might even be lowered, further hiding dining patrons from street view.  With the smells of pizza in the air, surrounded by the urban industrial decor that has taken over most of the newer eateries in the last few years (raw edge counters, swivel matte black bar stools, oversized dome lighting) - which I like, by the way! - I ordered an Americano that came to just under $3.  I assume that Strada opened quite recently, since the cash person busily conversed with the barista about things she was seeing on the screen. Service for me was fine - friendly but not overly so.  The coffee was fine and it wasn't too noisy at the time. They had some delicious-sounding pastries at the front as well (nutella danish, anyone?) but the paper-bags holding them were greasy-looking.  Nothing over-wowed me, but I wouldn't mind coming by to try out the restaurant side, since the smells coming from the back half were good."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice.  The restaurant looks nice,  good ambiance.  The problem was the service and the outcome of the pizza.  The server that time was not attentive and didn't get the instruction properly.  Then the pizza was burnt.  Then they tried again but it turned to be bland.  Anyway,  I hope they will improve the service better.  I love the open kitchen btw,  it was a real show."}
{"text":"Bit of a hidden gem in Chinatown! I would say the pizza is as good as Libretto with none of the wait, and I will definitely be back for more of that. Staff was great, and prices were more than reasonable.   I wasn't crazy about the pasta. We had the mushroom linguine, which came recommended by the waitress, but I felt it was missing some meaty goodness..."}
{"text":"best pizza in the city!  great staff!  yay strada!"}
{"text":"Not sure if the other reviewers were eating at the same restaurant as me! The food was mediocre at best, the server friendly but unforgivably inexperienced and poorly trained, the espresso without the crema!? Not going back. Only for kids who live in the area and don't know their way around a kitchen. Real foodies will not be eating at this place."}
{"text":"Who would've thought that the Rubino brothers, owners of the now-defunct upscale Rain and Ame, would open up a casual Italian restaurant serving up pizza and pasta?   What went in my belly:  Bellini ($9) - A darn good one made with real peach puree.  Strada 241 Caesar Salad ($9) -  This certainly isn't your run-of-the-mill Caesar salad. Romaine and radicchio leaves were lightly grilled with the leaves still crispy and juicy. The salad was lightly dressed and had a subtle lemon flavour. My only complaint would have to be the \"croutons\" which came out a little burnt. I also would've preferred them bite-size as I had to eat them with my hands like a cracker.  Zia Rita Pizza - tomato, nduja sausage, fire roasted onions, rapini, parmigiano ($15): I really enjoyed their tomato sauce and their nduja sausage was a stand-out for me. The spiciness of the sausage was balanced out by the slight bitterness of the rapini. As for their crust, while it was chewier than I would've preferred, it was not bad. Overall, a pretty solid pizza!   Overall, I had a great experience at Strada 241. Sure, I still think Libretto does a better pizza, but Strada's Italian fare is pretty solid. I can only hope that it doesn't suffer the same fate as the Rubino brothers' previous ventures."}
{"text":"One of our friends had a birthday party here, and I was favourably impressed. As many other people have noted, the restaurant is set in a great space, with high ceilings, interesting decor, and good ambiance.   The food was delicious. My wife and I had the fried squash with pesto sauce, and it was greasy but delicious. The pizzas we had were also excellent. I recommend the pizza with the boar sausage.    As it was my friend's birthday, they had prepared amazing cupcakes. The cupcakes had a meringue-ish top, buttercream under, dulce de leche in the center, and vanilla cake to contain everything. Jaw-dropping goodness. I don't think they're on the menu, but again, if you book a party here they'll probably make you something great.   The Nutella latte, as everyone says, is a must-have. The flavour is perfectly well done; there's just a hint of Nutella and sweetness, nothing like the syrupy bombs you normally get at places like Starbucks and Second Cup. On the other hand, if you like that kind of drink you're likely to be disappointed that you can't overwhelmingly taste Nutella.   We didn't even find the prices to be that bad; it's a little overpriced, but could be worse.    I did not enjoy the stools we sat on. They were metal and uncomfortable, with very low backs.   If I could, I would give this place 4.5 stars. I would ding it for the stools and the prices. Otherwise, everything was great."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a coffee with a friend today--the place looks beautiful, in the style of most of the new places in the city now: exposed brick walls, weathered hardwood floors, lots of reclaimed wood and marble counters.  The cafe area is unfortunately small, so we ended up sitting at the bar because there wasn't any table space, and the bar stools aren't the most comfortable.  The coffees were lovely, though (I had the nutella latte--delicious!), and the service was excellent.  Even after we'd finished our coffees, the barista refilled our water glasses quickly and without prompting."}
{"text":"This place is located in the heart of Chinatown.  Literally sandwiched between asian shops and restos, you will find this Italian trendy joint with super high ceilings.    I went there for the first time for a Yelp Elite  event.  The front was rammed with people. I don't think that they were ready for the hoards of people that the event was expected to bring in.   So we watched them with interest and intensity as they rolled out pre-prepared trays of fresh dough, prepared the pizzas in a production line fashion and slid them into 2 high speed ovens.  They were able to prepare 10 pizzas at a time. Swarms of people hovered by the bar where the pizzas were being served waiting with empty plates like a pack of vultures.  We waited with anticipation as we watched them slide in the pizzas with a long wooden paddle.  Some people held out their plates to be served.  We were able to taste two kinds of pizzas after a long wait.  Margherita pizza - tomato sauce, fresh buffalo mozarella, drizzle of fresh olive oil and basil.  The pizza was de-li-cious!!!  The crust was thin, the cheese was melt-in-your mouth, and the basil was fresh.  The second pizza was roasted potatoes with olives, buffalo mozarella and tomatoes.  The potatoes tasted like scallopped potatoes and the pizza was very tasty though we all agreed it needed something extra like spinach or sauce.  Slices of pizza were flying off plates and people were drawn in like moths to a flame when the pizzas were plated.  The guy who was making the pizza looked extremely serious. Intense gazing and concentration was trepidating through the kitchen. One yelped dared joke he was like the pizza nazi - \"no pizza for you!\".    Near the end of the night, there was one more remaining slice of margherita pizza. It sat there on its own.  My friend was tapped on the shoulder by a woman to find out if anyone wanted that last lone slice. He told her that it looked as though someone had taken a bite out of it but put it back on the plate. She grabbed the slice yelling out \"I'll take my chances\".  It was a great event and a great turnout!  Thanks Evelyn for organizing. And thanks Yelp for the red Elite socks. They are knee high and of good quality not to mention cute!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere and service were both top notch but the price point is substantially higher than comparable Italian restaurants. The quality of the food was average but certainly not spectacular."}
{"text":"First time coming here for a recent yelp event with my sister, was extremely busy but of course it was an event, I really enjoyed the mozzarella basil pizza, especially the very thin crust! Was a little hard to cut but we managed it anyways.   I would definitely like to come back during a normal night to try some of the other dishes which looked so super nummy!"}
{"text":"I'm writing this review as I'm nibbling on the Luca pizza $16 that has cured meat and leeks.  The crust is delicious.  I find the overall the sauce may be a little too savoury just for my taste.  However, I can see this pizza going down really well with an Italian beer.   I actually just stopped by here because of the gorgeous building and was pulled in because I was really looking for a café joint to hangout and push out my project paper and didn't want to try to squeeze in with the crowd at Dark Horse.   It's a café bar resto with open kitchen concept.  I enjoy the vibe of the place but have mixed feelings on it being a bit of everything.  However the staff is friendly and make me feel welcomed even though I initially came in just for the freshly baked goods. The walnut choco chip cookie is delish.    Great place to chill with your friends for lunch or  if you're looking for a more relaxing and less crowded atmosphere to be on your laptop.  I will try the nutella latte next time."}
{"text":"I will start by saying I liked the food and I will return again. My husband and I eat out a lot so this may become our regular place for dinner.  Strada is not pretentious and their staff are friendly. The food was pretty yummy.  We ordered Bread and Olive, Pizza Rita, Spaghetti All'amatriciana and Chocolate Semifreddo. Bread and Olive was not your usual. The olives come warm. They were cooked/warmed with vinegared carrots and onions in olive oil based dressing. Not sure if everyone would enjoy this dish, but we both like olives so it worked well for us. I would order again. The Pizza was not too thin or thick. Just thick enough if you need to pickup the last few bits with your hand. Good amount of sauce and cheese. The flavour was good. Spaghetti was al dente. It was perfectly cooked. The sauce was very tasty. Chocolate Semifreddo was an ice cream in a jar with a small fudge and a chocolate meringue. I liked it and would order it from time to time. But other reviewers seemed to enjoy it much more than I did.  I have one small negative comment. I think it was one of the Rubino brothers that was there attending to the floor. It was nice to see the owners there, but it looked like he didn't care to be there..... It was nice to see him clear our table, but he would drag the plates and would drop or almost drop the utensil from the plates. No apologies. His face was expressionless."}
{"text":"Zia RItta Pizza (with sausage, rapini, fire roasted onions) was delicious. Nice crust, nice sauce, well balanced veggie with cheese & sausage. AMAZING: Olive Oil ICE CREAM!!! That's right. It is delicious and the taste and aroma opens up once you pour espresso over it! Well done, Strada 241!"}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's birthday.  Things I liked about the place: -beautiful space -good menu with just the right number of choices -delicious, delicious Nutella late -we pre-ordered cupcakes, and they were amazing!    Not crazy about the amount of parsley on top of my pizza (and I like parsley)"}
{"text":"I ordered 21 pizzas from Strada241 for my graduation party. The pizzas were perfect and the service was great too."}
{"text":"been here a few times  love the design. Location was a formerly a grocery store .   pizzas are neapolitan style (900 degrees for 90 sec), dough is bit drier than libretto ,which is my standard for neapolitan style. strada's dough is more like queen margherita and pizzaria via mercanti's.   stand out item is the Italian custard dessert, it is served with a scoop of lemone gelato, and topped with shaved lemon and some crispy graham bits for texture, served in a glass jar. It's amazing! lemon lovers gone to heaven with this one."}
{"text":"Went here on Monday night and it is an awesome little gem of a place. Decor: tall ceilings, exposed brick, vintage images of Spadina, exposed beams, and fantastic lighting.  The place is beautiful.   Service: Just fantastic. The food is good (more on that later), but I would come back for the service. Everyone is happy that you have come, they know the menu, they care about you, and they have a great sense of humour. Its a nice change from the too-cool-to-be-here kind of service that you get from some restaurants.  Food: We ordered quite a bit between the two of us. Fire roasted asparagus: delicious, well cooked, great accompanying sauce with just the right amount of acidity so that its not too rich. Bread and olives: The olives and pickled vegetables hummed with rosemary and were seasoned to perfection. Salumi for two: I think we need to order for four next time so we can have some to take home.  The prosciutto wasn't overly salty (a huge plus) and was just melt in your mouth, the spicy capicola had the right amount of heat for us chili-atics, and there was one more but I forgot the name of it.  Pizza: We ordered the Gianpaolo which was just delicious. Dessert: We had the semifreddo which was delicious. We were sad that we didn't order another, but we were so full.  All in all, it was a great experience and I look forward to coming back again."}
{"text":"Service was underwhelming and the food was mediocre.  But what really did it for me was when they told me not to come back.  Toronto doesn't need another snobby restaurant. Stay away."}
{"text":"Strada241 is a hidden gem in the heart of China town. It's Southern Italian ambiance and decor reminds you of a simpler time, making it a great place to unwind and relax. It offers a nice assortment of traditional Italian plates, such as pizza, pasta, salads and meat and cheese plates. The service is friendly and quick, but not pushy either. It's a great place to go on a date or with a group of friends. There's  a large, long wooden table at the end of the restaurant that can fit 8-12 people and they accept reservations."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Strada 241. I had heard good things, so my BF thought it would be nice to go on a Friday night. Our waiter was funny and attentive. We started off with the cheese plate and a side of olives, we then had the Gianpaolo which was amazing. The cured wildboar was delicious and different from the everyday food you might eat. We then had the Tagliatelle with shrimp, capicollo, sugar peas, raddichio, which again was really, really good. The wine list is somewhat small, but the food definitely made up for it."}
{"text":"This is a nice addition to Chinatown. The interior decor is what makes it. Very modern and chique design. You have the option of a selection of great oven made pizzas that are thin crust. It was a great place for an event in my book! Will return."}
{"text":"looking for anything new around Chinatown, Strada 241 comes up.  when I look at the address, I couldn't picture it in my mind where it is exactly. I had to walk up & down on Spadina Ave. a few times before I realize it's in the old building there next to the new TD bank.  Finally got a chance to check this place out on Sunday before work starts, once I pass through the small door, the place is really big in there, to my surprise that they have a section in the back as a restaurant. (my first thought of this place is just a small cafe with a few chairs.)  took a quick look at the cookies, pastries and other baked goods, I decided to just have a drink for my first visit.  Nutella Latte caught my eyes and that's a great choice! For just $3.50 you get the Hazelnut-ty flavor latte that's million times better then what you get at some chain that sells you s**t for $3...  checked out their menu on Facebook http://www.facebook.com/Strada241  and they just got the liquor licence!!  can't wait to try the food and wine there.  9/15"}
{"text":"Having come here for a Yelp event, but arriving late and therefore not getting much to eat (our own fault), my friend and I decided to have a proper carb feast here last night.It's easy to do here, as they don't have any mains that aren't pizza or pasta.  I made a reservation for 7 pm, thinking it might be really busy. When I arrived a little early, the place looked like it was just opening. There was a lone man sitting in the middle of the dining room whom I thought was a staff member finishing his shift, and a few people occupying the banquettes. I took the back banquet, and waited for my friend, keeping company with a tequila caesar, that was tasty, but felt like a watered down version of my empty belly favourite.  When my friend arrived we ordered a bottle of white, the calamari, a thin crust pizza with guincale, leek and gorgonzola and a linguine dish with mushroom and lemon.   The calamari was nice-- very crispy with a slightly spicy marinara sauce and each piece was stabbed on it's own little spike attached to a wooden board. Props for cool presentation.  The pasta was wonderfully al dente and the sauce had a creamy yet identifiable lemon flavour. Mushrooms could have been a better seasonal choice being that it's May and there are lots of wild ones growing. I think they were simple creminis.  Pizza was tasty, but this not a great crust. It's impossible to cut and the part that holds the toppings was super soggy. The topping combination was nice, but they all slid off then we tried to cut slices and pull the pizza. Definitely not my favourite in the city.  Service was super efficient and our server was friendly, offering her favourites from the menu when we asked. Our wine and water glasses were never empty, but curiously, the restaurant was.  During our dinner two more tables came in, but this is not an intimate space. With the warehouse ceilings and sprawling space between the front bar, chef's table and the dining room, it felt very empty for a Thursday night in downtown Toronto and very different from the Yelp Party!   I don't think I'd come back to Strada 241. Pizza is definitely better at Libretto and the pasta at Enoteca Sociale eclipses Strada's for a comparable price. If I'm craving carbs, this won't be my place."}
{"text":"Well I can confirm that big groups do indeed have a good time here. Nice time at the event last week! Hard-working staff and pleasant pizza and beer."}
{"text":"I never go to chinatown but now I have reason to.  this place is a GEM randomly in the heart of that area.  The inside is super cute with exposed brick and an open kitchen. Started with the calamari which was nothing outstanding, but presentation was cool because the pieces are placed individually onto sticks.  ok so HANDS DOWN the best pizza ever! I am going to dare to say that it is better than Terronis pizza by A LOT. I tried the Gianpaolo -tomato, wild boar cacciatore, funghi, spinach.  The fresh tomato sauce was heavenly, the toppings were fantastic (and I don't normally like salami), the crust was amazing, it was just GRAND.  Excellent service by a cute waiter too.  Legit my new fav italian resturant."}
{"text":"Having been to Strada 241 on numerous occasions its safe to say the food is delicious. Come here for the pizzas! Fresh flavours, from the dough to the tomato sauce. Execution is on point.   Also try the daily soups!   Service has always been friendly although a few times they were unaware of some of the dishes when asked questions.  The restaurant gives the Neighbourhood some much needed diversity since its located right in chinatown."}
{"text":"After hearing that this place makes its own gluten free pizza dough fresh onsite and from scratch (vs others who buy it pre made including preservatives etc.) I had to give it a try. In a word, \"da-best\"!!  (and lots of great wine options too).   If you're looking for simple fresh Italian with a gourmet twist or a pizza and a glass of wine in a great atmosphere this is a great spot. 4.5"}
{"text":"This was definitely an A-OK experience, but mostly driven by how excited my boyfriend was about having Gluten Free Pasta and Pizza so close to home.  I ordered regular pizza and it was pretty good, and I tried his GF pizza and it was thin-crust and crunch - which I really like in a pizza.  It either had too much sauce or gluten free dough can't absorb sauce well, and therefore the crust got soggy pretty quickly.   I would go back again, but if it were't for the gluten free stuff, I'd probably skip it."}
{"text":"I went here for a YELP event and it was really really busy.  Since we were hungry, we decided to just eat dinner at the back instead.  Overall the service was REALLY good.  The staff were excellent.    The pizza was lacking some flavour.  We had a number of dishes and all of them just left us with a 'meh' in response.  I couldn't help compare it to Pizza Libreto, which in my opinion has very good pizza.    The restaurant itself is very nice. I would recommend this for after work dinner with friends."}
{"text":"Just realized my review is posted under 'Strada' when the full name of this resto is 'Strada 241'. Here is my original review:  This place was a total surprise. It has been open since October but somehow snuck by me on my walks through Chinatown. It is located towards the southern end of Chinatown where the ambience becomes a little more upscale (think Dark Horse, Hotel Ocho).  Walking by, we were enticed by the lovely high ceilings we could see through the front door. The interior is beautiful-exposed brick wall, hanging light bulbs and comfy wooden tables. Having a quick glance at the menu we decided to stay and try out one of their pizza's.   t was ~9pm on Saturday and the place was packed! But they did manage to find a table for us with no wait time. Our servers (two of them) were both extremely friendly and attentive. The menu was explained to us in detail-we decided to go with the charred casear salad ($9), a meat platter ($12) and then share the meatball pizza ($16). I was informed that all their meats come from local farms, where the animals are free range and organic (very important for low-meat consumer like myself).   I loved the charred salad! What a great idea, would never of thought of it myself. Crispy leaves and sensual creamy parmesan dressing. Gah...I will come back just for the salad. This was followed by the meat plate-salami and prosciutto.  The pizza was delicious-thin crusted with just enough cheese. The meatballs were not too greasy.   With a glass of wine, our meal came to around $70 with tax and tip. After paying I noticed i had been overcharged for 2 salads instead of one. What took my rating from 4 to 5 stars is that the waitress was kind enough to refund me out of her own $, so I wouldn't have to wait around while her manager sorted out the error. Now you know what I mean when I mentioned the service was excellent!  If you are looking for a new venue comparable to Terroni's or Kalendar, try here!"}
{"text":"I have to say this restaurant was wonderful! I can't find any thing bad about this place, everything was on point. Especially the Pizza. The best pizza that I've had in Toronto. The prices were good, the service was excellent. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Was recommended by a friend on my dragon boat team!  Missed the team lunch but went the first chance I had...oh man...  Very helpful at the front, friendly, didn't really ask for the reservation info, but she said they only had 1 for the evening (it was a Wednesday night or something) and there were plenty of open tables, so she sat me wherever I liked.  Smart girl :P  Server was very nice and let my friends and I catch up for 15 min before we settled on our food order.    We split the Michele e Paolo pizza, the Zia Rita, and the Linguini Puttanesca.  The pizza was delicious!  Thin, chewy and crispy crust...I usually prefer a heavier dough, but this was good, and didn't flop over when you picked up a slice (a true achievement!).  Not overly salty but plenty flavorful, although I did not turn down the chili oil the server offered.  More sweet than spicy, but quite yummy (I am a hot sauce and Sriracha monster, by the way).  The pasta was also fantastic, plenty of clams and olives which I love, a great texture, and cooked to a point of happiness.  To end we simply ordered 1 of each of what they had that night : Chocolate/Hazenut semifreddo, Olive Oil gelato, some sort of lemon curd/meringue...that lemon thing is AMAZING.  With a little tuile cookie on top.  Smooth, cold, wonderfully lemony...The Semifreddo was good too, had a chocolate meringue cookie on top, which I think I liked (a slightly salted tone I'm undecided about), but my friends were bigger fans of the tuile.  The gelato had a bit of a strange after taste...not the best OO Gelato I've had.    Plenty of food, plenty of service, AND we chatted/ate for easily 2.5 hrs, and closed the place down.  They never rushed us, just kept on with their tasks and were polite and friendly when we left (but we did apologize for being there so late).  Still.  Was nice to not feel pressured.   Am planning to get back another time already!  Would definitely recommend! :)"}
{"text":"3.3/5  I was quite excited when I heard about this place. Its a really cute Italian cafe & restaurant on Spadina where you can get your coffee from extremely fancy espresso machine. They got some nice comfort Italian food but I been better places with similar price so I was bit disappointed.   If you are looking for a nice cup of coffee or cute place to hang out with friends, this isn't a bad place to check out but for food, I will just go to King street and will get a better pizza."}
{"text":"The calamari was good, but not enough. The display was very nice.  Been there before, and the pizza was better then. But the sea food soup was amazing. Finished it off with one of the best tasting cappacino"}
{"text":"3.5 / 5  Strada 241 is a strange little place.  Situated in the heart of Chinatown, this Italian restaurant sticks out like a sore thumb, but is a welcome departure from the other shops in it's vicinity.  I went here for dinner with a friend and overall the experience was pretty good.  The interior of the place has a nice oldschool Italian vibe to it, with an open cafe/bar at the front side and an actual dining area at the back.  Nothing overly special but still unique and enjoyable.  The food itself was pretty good, I've had both better and worse pasta before.  I had a Linguini dish with an interesting lemon and garlic based sauce.  The lemon flavor was a bit overpowering but it still tasted pretty good, certainly not the worst thing I've had at an Italian restaurant.  A surprising treat that I experienced here was their nutella latte.  Normally I don't get excited about these sorts of things but this was pretty darn good.  The price for the food was a bit much in relation to the quality.  For my pasta and latte in addition to her pizza and ice cream, the total was around $60 with everything included.  Not insane by any means but a bit overpriced.  I must mention though that the service was fantastic, very quick, caring and reliable.  Overall this is a pretty good place that you should give a shot, although it's nothing mind blowing."}
{"text":"Do not have tea at Strada!!  I know, why would you?   Well I did one fateful Sunday morning. My green tea arrived as a empty mug and small tea pot. I looked into the mug was surprised to see a ring of brown markings- coffee stains. I thought, fair enough, this is a coffee place. I took it up to the barista and he said he would get me a new one. I watched him look at all his mugs, not able to find one that was not stained. He then said he would \"give it a polish.\" He sprayed a liquid from a bottle into it and wiped it with a cloth. He returned it to me, smelling like vinegar. I was fed up and didn't bother to protest. SOoooo grossed out and unimpressed!"}
{"text":"I quite like this place. The combination of the converted warehouse setting and the comforting Italian food make it a winner. The menu is short and simple with a heavy emphasis on the pizzas. As mentioned in another review, the pizza is comparable to Libretto without the over-hyped wait times.   I have been back to Strada a number of times since it opened and I see no reason why I would not continue to frequent it regularly."}
{"text":"Well...  I'm from Chicago so I went to this restaurant with an open mind.  However, the service was poor.  I went here for dinner with my husband and since 3 small tables by the windows were empty we requested to sit there.  However, we were informed that those tables were only for 4 people??  So our options were the hot counter by the pizza ovens or a stuffy table in the back.  :(  I guess 2 customers are not worthy of a table by the window.  Except that a few minutes later 2 of those tables had only 2 guests??  :/  Well we ordered the pizza and were told that they cook pretty fast.  The restaurant was not terribly crowded so we had our drinks while we waited and waited and waited...  We drank our drinks and the server didn't even come back until the cook brought out the dry, burnt pizza.  I couldn't even eat it.  Overall a bad experience and a little on the pricey side for what you get.  Oh and parking in this area is near impossible.  I do not recommend."}
{"text":"I was ultra excited to come here considering the Rubino brothers had opened this up, and I had an AMAZING time at AME. I booked this place for about 10 people for my farewell party. The ambiance is okay-- a little loud, but nice.   Here are some of the things that we had ordered: 1) CALAMARI FRITTI: Delectable -- cute too as they serve it on a bed of nails, similar to that at AME. 2) SQUASH FRITTI: Didn't get to try it, but I'm sure it's similar to that of AME. 3) TUNA CARPACCIO?: I can't exactly remember what fish it was, but it was definitely a carpaccio of some sort. It was the special -- highly recommend this as a starter. 4) ZIA RITA PIZZA: Sorry, Rubino brothers, but this pizza is incomparable to Pizzeria Libretto and Terroni. 5) LIMONE: Lemon custard. Can you go wrong? .. However... 6) CHOCOLATE & HAZELNUT SEMIFREDDO: I was SO jealous of my friends who had ordered this. Usually, I'm not a huge nut on chocolate desserts (it's usually too sweet for me). However, this was TO DIE FOR. I would definitely recommend this if you ever end up at Strada 241."}
{"text":"Okay - so we tried Strada 241 the other day. I have to say there were some things that they did very well, but they did fall down on the main meal. Decor is hip and casual. Food is largely Pizza, Pastas, Mains and Appetizers/Salad.  Highly recommend calarmari as a starter. The white pizza with potato/rosemary is excellent. My hubby had the pasta with clams BUT the clams were stone cold.  He said the pasta itself was good, but when he told the waiter that the clams were stone cold, the waiter went to the kitchen to advise and then -- nothing happened!  What!!??? Really??!! We expected he might come back with warm clams, but no such thing. It wasn't until the main was over that he came back + said the clams should have been warm - ya think? I mean, would you eat them being cold -- we worried they had not been cooked properly and no one wants to get sick on bad shellfish.  Anyway the manager did come over and give us some gift card for us to come back and use another time.  Not sure how much is on it -- but still not sure about this place -- I mean -- if you didn't impress us the first time -- why would we return.  Candidly as a note to the restaurant - it is better to comp someone right there for a screw up.  Shows you are investing in the long term dining relationship.  On top of it all meal is not inexpensive.  So for (2 people) sharing an appetizer, a couple of mains and 2 glasses of wine with tax and tip -- expect between $75-85."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and will continue to go back. The ambiance is fantastic- love the high ceilings and exposed brick. That being said, the combination of the two coupled with the large open space means sound travels... so you could look at it two ways- you'll either lose some intimacy because you'll have to speak loudly OR you'll get a little bit more because you can lean in nice and close. All depends what you're looking for.  I've never been unsatisfied. The calamari is quite good and the Squash Fritti with the salsa verde is exceptional. Pizzas have very simple flavours but those flavours are fresh and clean.   Oh... and deserts. Indulge yourself. They're awesome. We shared four different ones and each was rich and decadent.  It will be a regular stop until someone shows me something better."}
{"text":"The portions are absurdly small. So much so that it is offensive.I will never eat there again.  My brother had his birthday there in October. There were about 12 of us. We paid $25 each for \"family style' - a bunch of dishes for us to share. The portions were absurdly small. They served  four of us a small salad meant for one (as an appetizer). I took two leaves and realized I had taken too much! I had to put one back!. For the pasta's I had about three noodles of each. We all did. No one was happy. Everyone at our table thought It was a complete  a rip off. At least half the table went to McDonald's afterwards.    My brother asked about the portions prior to booking and was assured there would be enough. When we complained to management about the ridiculous portions, we were told \"well what do you expect for $25\".   The little bit of food I did have was good but nothing special. Besides the horrible way management dealt with our complaint the service was otherwise good."}
{"text":"VIBE  First, I love that there's a non-Asian space in the middle of Chinatown. The space is gorgeous and there's plenty of seating around the kitchen, which I like. They also have chairs with backs on them which is perfect for those at the bar who want to linger around a long meal. There were a few groups here so this might be a good place for a party who wants something relatively affordable downtown.   WE ATE We had the caesar salad to start. It's grilled but I felt it had a bit too much mayo on it . It was okay. Dining companion had the pizza. He said simply it was \"good.\" I had the fettuccine with mushrooms. I thought I was going to get a creamy sauce. It was basically a bunch of cooked mushrooms and parsley. I kid you not, I was going to cook that up for myself BEFORE I went out for dinner for a snack. I get that this place is \"simple food\" but if I'm paying upwards of $16 to $20 there better be some nonna mafia in the back. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great. Though the server did give me the wrong dish, she handled the situation well and got me the dish I wanted while offering me the other dish. I didn't take it. The wine was very good and unlike Buca, the waitress knew which wine to pair with the dish and why.   That said, I don't think I'd come back here to eat.  To make it worse, I had everyone from the waitress to the cook in front of me to the owner ask me how my meal was and yes, I lied because I didn't really want to make a big deal out of it. It's a lot of pressure! So Yelp is basically my space where I can be an a-hole. I think they knew because I didn't finish my pasta and it's not a good sign when I'm not finishing my meal (if it's good the plate is being licked clean, quite simply).   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  Love the location. Love the space. Wine was good. Didn't love the food. That's it. Good for a pre-drink at the bar though so you can get a good value meal elsewhere."}
{"text":"imo, the tomato sauce is damn-near perfect.  slightly, slightly under-seasoned to me.  the pasta and pizza were among the best i've had in toronto.  the semifreddo is unique and tasty.  the espresso gives dark horse a serious run for its money.    incredible value.  excellent service.    really looking forward to trying their entire menu."}
{"text":"We've had a couple of meals and a few coffees here, and so far I'm happy. Yes, you can get a cheaper and better margherita pizza at Libretto, but these pies are pretty tasty (if slightly overpriced), and we don't have to trek over to Ossington and fight our way through hordes of hipsters to get it.   The coffee is solid; the space is gorgeous, all soaring ceilings and wooden beams (the building itself has a really interesting history as an old flophouse--kudos to the resto partners for rescuing the space and putting it to good use). I love the open-concept kitchen: next time I plan to sit at the bar and watch my pizza being made. The service is friendly and generally competent.   Most of all, I'm just SO GLAD these folks opened up in Chinatown--we live in this neighbourhood and the total lack of non-Asian options for dinner was really starting to grate on my nerves!!! Looking forward to making this place our go-to local for when we really can't face another bowl of lo mein. Yay for restaurant diversity!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant has been open (soft) for a couple of days and is still working out some of the kinks. The food was very good. Had grilled ceasar salad and a pizza. The salad was very good, the dressing nicely done with garlic. The pizza was good but the oven was acting up and the top of the pizza was not as well done as the bottom. The service was very slow but I could tell that this wouldn't continue. The kitchen is open and everyone was working on making things run better. The one thing about an open kitchen, everyone can see when someone is slacking. Free entertainment to go with the meal."}
{"text":"Had coffee with my buddy here a few weeks ago. Very lovely decor - the usual exposed brick walls, hardwood, high ceilings and huge marble counters.   My americano was nicely done, no complaints there. Staff was very friendly and let us linger for a really long time, bringing us water a few separate times. There wasn't really a good area to sit and have coffee, but we sat up at the bar.  Will have to go back and try the pizzas sometime!"}
{"text":"More like 2.5 stars. I'm giving two so the owners will have more incentive to make the necessary tweaks.  I really wanted to like Strada 241. It's a beautiful space and the service is friendly, but the food was lackluster. We split a salumi plate and each had a pizza (I had the 'nduja). The salumi plate was nice but a little on the small side and lacking in variety, with only three meats. The pizzas looked good but were pretty tasteless - the cheese was bland, the sauce was bland and missing the necessary balance of tanginess and sweetness, and the crust was dried out and lacking flavor (probably a result of the electric oven).  I would come back to try the pastas and also to see if the pizza improves. There's no lack of effort here and the food is honest."}
