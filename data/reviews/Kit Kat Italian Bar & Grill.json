{"text":"Quant and cozy authentic Italian restaurant in the heart of Toronto. You almost feel like you're in New Yorks little Italy. Very romantic ambience but also cozy family vibe. Very tasty pasta dishes, so fresh and authentic. Also the caprese salad and grilled calamari were excellent starter choices. For the mains I highly recommend the Bolognese and seafood spagetti as they were incredible!"}
{"text":"After watching a show at the princess of whales theater we decided to have some dessert. This place has a magical touch to it. The tiramisu is made in house as well as the creme brûlée, the latte I had was one of the best I've ever had. I'm so excited to go here for a full course meal. Totally worth the 5 *"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times now when downtown.  It's a cozy little place with an extremely harrow hallway you have to walk down to get to the seating area.  Watch out for the single step going into the seating area  I nearly broke my neck and fell down.  Food is great, service is great and prices are average considering the location in restaurant alley downtown.  Repeat - yes."}
{"text":"My dinner was good but my friend's dinner (salmon pasta) was salty.  The food came pretty fast.  But the Waiter aka \"Fabio\" was arrogant.  The service we received from him was not expected from a King Street restaurant.  He should consider working at Pizza Pizza.  I won't be coming here again."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on Saturday night. The food was good (not superb) but I found the staff to be very rude and pushy. They were practically pushing us out the door. We had a reservation for 5 and 2 from our group were a bit late (stuck in Toronto traffic!) The 3 of us ordered wine and appitizers and snacked while we chatted. The waitress asked us about 7 times in 25 minutes where the rest of our party was and sighed heavily when we said that they were stuck in traffic. The maitre d also came over to our table twice to question us. One time he even said \"there are people at the bar waiting for a table who hate you for taking so long\" I was so offended! What if we were not waiting for others and were simply savoring our drinks and appitizers? I do not like to be rushed when I'm eating, especially when I'm paying so much for it! Once we got our entrees we didn't see the waitress again until she brought the bills. Go figure. The atmosphere and food was decent but I would not return simply due to the staff's poor attitude."}
{"text":"A favourite amongst many Torontonians. Good locale and nice crowd. Have tried it twice, and have neither been disappointed or thrilled with it. Ribs were okay and pasta decent. Third time lucky? Let's hope."}
{"text":"This is my third time going to Kit Kat, and I absolutely love it. I have no complaints, if your going there for dinner better make reservations, because its always booked.  My dad and I went there for an early dinner around 4pm and we had no problems getting a table.   Service was excellent we came in and were seated right away  and they took our coats for us, the staff was very friendly and very knowledgeable about the specials.    First I would like to start with the drinks I just had a coke my dad ordered a rusty nail, this was the first time I ever herd him say \"now that's how you make a rusty nail\".  Drinks were good and reasonably priced.     We both had the grilled calamari rings to start, very tasty and lots of flavor.  We both ordered the specials (I always order the specials when I go there). My dad had the veal chop with mushrooms, which he enjoyed very much. His only complaint they could have put more of the port sauce on the veal chop.  I had the sea food pasta on the recommendation of our server. It was a shrimp, scallop and clam sea food pasta dish. Very tasty and lots of flavour. I inhaled it.   Overall experience was excellent. Service was very good and friendly, food was excellent, atmosphere was cozy and another thing that I really liked about the atmosphere was that it was warm and I wasn't sitting there with the shivers.   Will I go back there? Of course, their food is excellent and very tasty and anyone who I have taken there has also loved it.  The price for how much we ordered including drinks wasn't bad either."}
{"text":"A weekday team lunch for 8 people was accommodated without any hassle. Restaurant was a little a small but adds to the charm of the place! Service was very prompt and our waitress constantly checked in on us. Most people ordered the seafood linguine and all cleaned their plates. Will be back."}
{"text":"Nice ambient and friendly personal. Food is basic Italian food (no pizza though). Anyway it was very good. Noodles where \"al dente\" the creme brulee just awesome and freshly made. We will bee back!"}
{"text":"What happened ? Has there been a change in ownership or attitude ? Made reservation and still ended up in back corner next to pillar. Looks like they have jammed more tables into an extremely tight spot to start with. Waitress very pleasant but bus boy down right rude. Asked people sitting at table beside us to stand up from their dinner, pull in chairs,  so he could deliver food to another table. It seemed like a big inconvenience asking him for anything. ( treated everyone with indifference the entire night) We held our ground but also seemed like they wanted us out fast as there were people waiting.  Have gone here for years but with this latest poor service, I will not be frequenting this place again.  \" postage stamp\" room to eat and rude service along with rushing one to leave is not my idea of an enjoyable evening out."}
{"text":"Worst dirty martini ever. Food was good but limited menu. Would have liked olive oil for the bread instead of butter packs. My teenagers loved it. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"We arrived without a reservation and they very kindly were able to seat us.  Although we had to wait awhile for the food (see no reservation above) it was well well worth the wait.  This place will be close to the top of my list the next time we're in Toronto."}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed with Kit Kat and wouldn't go back.  Unfortunately there wasn't really anything good to say about the place.  The food was bland and was tv-dinner quality.  I had a smoked chicken penne that was not only bland, but came with burned chicken.  The pasta was a little cold, which made the burned chicken all that more ironic.  My friend went with the angel hair pasta, which was just as bad.  The only thing that was half decent was the cheese garlic bread, which isn't saying much.  Even the standard bread they gave us was stale.  Unfortunately the service might have been worse than the food.  Our food took forever forever to make (and it wasn't busy), we had to ask for bread (since it took forever for the food), and had to beg the waitress to get us water.  I literally asked for water 5x over 10 minutes before I got her attention--another waitress saw the empty glass and just said to wait for ours to come.  They also never asked us how the food was once; she basically just dropped it off and left.  Even the parmesan was the cheap store grated mix (rather than freshly grated).  This was definitely not worth $50 for such terrible food and service."}
{"text":"Had a fettuccine Alfredo, and then the disappointment, ton of garlic powder. For 20bucks you don't expect this. i suffered the entire night afterwards, done with Kit Kat"}
{"text":"The service is top notch and the food follows suit. Highly recommended if you happen to be in the area. Especially accommodating if you are seeing a show."}
{"text":"Went there with my family, first impression was a little weird. We had to close the tiny first door and wait for it to close in a tiny triangular space to open the second one. The place is tiny and narrow but had a charming vibe to it. We passed in front of the kitchen through a narrow hallway that gave us a vibe of excitement. We sat in a booth at the very end of the restaurant which was actually really cozy and private.  We all had water, I don't know if they have any sodas but it was fine. I had the fetuccine alberto and shared it with my sister, I expected it to be bigger but it was just the right size for us two, since we don't eat much. My brother had the atlantic salmon which was great, too. Then my parents ordered the filet mignon and the steak. The filet mignon was missing some sauce to it, but it was good.  Then we ordered some desserts, the cheesecake was great and so was the crème brûlée. The fudge cake was kinda dry, though. Service was good; very kind and attentive. The walls had writing over them which was really cool and there was a tree (synthetic) in the middle of the kitchen.  The lattes were delicious btw. A little cramped, but if you don't mind, you'll probably love it."}
{"text":"I came here based on the recommendation of the hotel concierge. The ambiance is old school but cozy. The highlight of my meal was the Caesar salad. The salmon was ok, but needed extra flavor. I asked for extra lemon and the bartender grabbed two lemon wedges with her hands and put on my plate. Not an acceptable move in this day and age.   Speaking of this day and age why don't they have guest wifi?"}
{"text":"I went with a fri end during the week around lunch time. It was perfect and exactly what we were looking for - good food, good service and a reasonable price.  I got Rigationi Bolognese and it was VERY delicious. I highly recommend this dish. Portion was just the perfect amount as well.  I would definitely go again and can't wait to try other pasta dishes."}
{"text":"I have been here four times now, so feel that I have enough experience with the menu and staff to write a fair and accurate review.  I have always enjoyed the food, and found both the pasta and meat dishes to be full of flavour and big enough to share.  Their specials are always delicious and worth taking a chance on, but seem to stay the same and don't offer a lot of variety from visit to visit.  Their pastas are saucy and offer a nice variety of both cream and tomato sauces, however my favourite pasta dishes at Kit Kat are always their meat pasta specials, which I have always seen done in a brandy mustard cream sauce.  This combination of flavours in the sauce goes great with both beef and duck, and is their best pasta sauce.  If there is a pasta offered with this sauce order it, you won't be disappointed.  The cream makes it rich, but the brandy and mustard add a unique flavouring that you won't get any where else.   Their meat dishes are always cooked perfectly to your order, and are huge.  I had the veal chop special last night and it was huge and cooked to a perfect medium rare, which kept it moist and tender.  The mashed potatoes were just o-k, but they were just a filler on the plate under the huge chop.  Desserts are just o-k as well.  They offer quite a few different desserts, but only the creme brule and Tiramisu are made in house.  The creme brule is delicious and creamy, with a thick crunchy sugar topping, but the Tiramisu was awful.  There was barely any marscapone between the layers, and the lady fingers were barely soaked, leaving them dry and flavourless.  However the waitress did take it off the bill when we told her how disappointing it was, which was appreciated.  Service is fast and impersonal.  They are usually very busy so that might explain this, but I have never found the waiters and waitresses to be overly attentive or friendly.  They are always rushing around and don't have the time to give the personalized service that makes the difference between o-k service and excellent service.  I would definitely recommend reservations, as even when you make them you usually have to wait at least 5 minutes for your table.  Despite the few negatives I have pointed out, I would suggest this restaurant for dinner or lunch, without hesitation.  The prices are reasonable, and you can get a good bottle of their house wine for $30.    If I could give half stars this would really be a 3 1/2 star review, but since I can't I had to go down to a 3 rather than up to a 4, only because of the service and the Tiramisu."}
{"text":"-Great place for a business lunch -Get the Italian sausage plate (off-menu, ask your waiter -Everything on the chalk menu is good -Fresh ingredients, well spiced  Kit Kat is consistently delicious and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Always quality food. Great specials. Very accommodating. Small patio, but great spot in the summer.  No condo development signage & postcards unnecessary when dining out."}
{"text":"Great place, great food ! Best calamari I've ever had!   Service was quick. Amazing little spot."}
{"text":"Nice little italian place. Food was average, nothing special. Pasta overcooked which is always a key indicator in an italian restaurant. And do not expect a smile when you will be \"welcomed\" by the lady behind the bar....."}
{"text":"Great Italian place. I got a seafood linguini and it was delish! Also, I shared mussels with tomato sauce with my hubby. The sauce was amazing!"}
{"text":"I've been to Kit Kat a few times in the past year, and have enjoyed it each time.  The food is delicious, and the service friendly.  Some of the standouts include the lemon chicken, pasta with spicy italian sausage, and mussels in a sauce so delicious it had dining companions fighting over the bread to soak it up!    The only complaint I have is that the tables near the bar get a bit tight when there are a lot of people waiting for  a table.  Also, the tiny entrance door is fiercely guarded in the winter to keep those sitting by the door protected from the cold...it is much appreciated, but it's a bit uncomfortable to have to practically push out and close the outside door on people you don't know in order to be permitted inside."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a friend. Service was quick, friendly, and efficient. However, compared to many of the other restaurants on the same block, the food was disappointing. Bland sauces. Slightly overpriced.  Summary: acceptable food, nothing *wrong* with the place, but not particularly great."}
{"text":"Great Service! Pasta is fresh and fish is great. The pecan pie is amazing. The staff there is so friendly, and don't forget to touch the tree for good luck."}
{"text":"Went here for a friends birthday dinner. there was 8 of us and we sat in the back. A bit crowded but a lovely ambience in there. the whole place was bright and airy with the kitchen there all the lovely food smells gave the place a nice atmosphere.  sampled a few appetizers which were all devine and had a special pasta dish with steak in it. bit spicy for my sensitive buds but was still delicious. our waitress was excellent and would definitely return."}
{"text":"I come in here for their creme brulee. They make it really well. It's just they're expensive, total was almost $15 for creme brulee with tax and tips. Also they kinda glare at you if you come in looking too average."}
{"text":"Excellent location, great food and prices are not bad in comparison to nearby competitors.  Why only one star??  Service (although fast) reeked of overall total disregard for the customer.  We went on the first weekend of TIFF and requested to sit outside on the specially-built patio overlooking the pedestrian TIFF walkway so we could soak up the atmosphere. Like many that weekend, we were busy with TIFF activities all day so dined very late - only arriving at the restaurant at 11.40pm. We ordered our food immediately and then, shortly after 11.50pm, I ordered a glass of wine to enjoy with my meal. It arrived, with my food, about 11.55. Great. I began to enjoy my dinner and wine and then at 11.58 pm the waitress came over and told me that I needed to finish my wine by midnight, in compliance with Ontario outside drinking laws.  I wasn't aware of that law, but the law itself wasn't the problem. The problem was that the waitress did not have the common decency to advise/remind me of this law BEFORE I ordered the glass of wine. What decent server allows a customer to order an item off the menu knowing that the customer won't have sufficient time to enjoy the item?! I felt completely ripped off. And it wasn't an innocent oversight by the server, either. One server took my order of wine, and then told me about this law, but ANOTHER one actually delivered me the glass of wine in between. Neither of them bothered their behinds to advise me that I would have to rush-drink the wine, and neither of them cared enough to suggest I order something else instead.   I quickly drank the wine before midnight, leaving me light-headed and nauseous while I ate the food. About twenty minutes later, the server came over and offered me another, complementary, glass of wine to drink inside after I had finished my meal. That did slightly make up for the poor service, but I couldn't help but notice that the server only offered me this AFTER a bunch of rowdy Italians at the adjacent table aggressively and vocally complained to her about the same issue. There was no offer of an apology or a complementary anything when I politely complained about the issue initially.  We took advantage of her offer after we finished our food and I had another glass of wine inside. We then overheard the manager/owner publically lambasting our server for giving us something for free. Ack. When we went to pay and left a debit card with the receipt, the same man came over and said ''cash or credit only!!'' and then ran away. I have no problem with that no debit policy, some of my favourite places in Toronto have the same rule. Problem here is, there was no visible sign anywhere in the restaurant explaining this policy, so we came unprepared. The manager did not suggest a nearby ATM or apologise for the inconvenience, which I thought was pretty shocking considering that he was aware we had already been let down by the service in his restaurant once that evening. For some bizarre reason, there is a scarcity of ATMS in the entertainment district, and my bf, who went in search of one, was gone for well over twenty minutes. What if we had been tourists with no knowledge of the city (and there are thousands of visitors for TIFF) The owner's unwillingness to apologise or help would have been even more shocking.  Even the cosy, authentic Italian style interior would not be enough to entice me back here."}
{"text":"Stay away.  It's fairly obvious that the staff simply don't care. The service is at best indifferent bordering on rude. It's easy to see why; the place is packed and they are having to turn people away. So the servers treat the diners as a nuisance.   This attitude seems to have infected the kitchen as well. The vegetable soup (the only on the menu) felt minutes removed from a can. The salmon fettuccine was nothing but salt. You'd think I could quench the thirst with my $7 bottle of beer, only the waitress snatched it away with at least 2 ounces still in the bottle without asking. No water was offered until I asked for it.   Not all was terrible, to be fair. On the positive side, my entire miserable experience lasted not even 40 minutes, so you have to give them that; with so many people lined up to disappoint, they are prompt at processing the nuisances, I mean customers, out the door. For that they get a star.  In the end, I felt they were happy to see me go. I know I was happy to leave.   Adios, KitKat. I know I will never see my $40 again, but you will never see me either."}
{"text":"Interesting little place with a great location if you are heading to the theatres. Service was very good with excellent attention to detail.  The mussels were very nice and there was a never- ending supply of bread to soak up that delicious broth. Chicken dish went over very well as did a farfalle special. Osso buco was quite good although the linguini didn't add anything to the dish. Seafood pasta was a bit less than expected, mostly down to the fact that it was in a tomato sauce."}
{"text":"Excellent classic Italian food done right! Loved the scallops & Caprese salad! The service was perfectly on point & we loved sitting on the intimate patio. Also a great wine list. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I always have a meal at Kit Kat when I am in Toronto. Cozy, cool vibe with great service and food. A little bit of everything on the menu, great wine list and warm atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great experience! I like good food and good service, and had both at Kit Kat's tonight. Our group had a number of the main courses, and all were a hit: the rainbow trout was tender, not overcooked, and drew exclamations from two other guests at our table. Our hypercritical companion kept raving about his rack of lamb,  and I enjoyed my Angus NY strip loin. I'm also fussy about dessert, and enjoyed their creme brûlée: not the best, but still good. I'd order it again. The service deserves special mention. We enjoyed a warm welcome from our host, and our waitress was consistently friendly, intelligent, accurate and prompt. Between her regular trips to our table, two other gentlemen also attended to our needs, and assisted us with wine selection. The wine they recommended was great!  As for the bar, I was delighted that the bartender carried a true,  dry vermouth, served perfectly on the rocks with a twist of lemon.  Perhaps the best compliment I can offer is that the food and great service combined with the intimate ambience to set the tone for a truly delightful evening. Every one of us left with memories of a great experience. Thanks, Kit Kat: we'll be back!"}
{"text":"So after my dining party couldn't make the ridiculous 6pm-latest reservation at Terroni, we headed to Kit Kat upon my dad's recommendation. I've always tried to avoid this block of restaurants here when possible because it seems like a trap for tourists, so I was a bit apprehensive.   Going in, however, I agreed to let go of all my snobbish--inhibitions and actually allowed myself to enjoy this dining experience immensely! The hidden, sunlit dining area in the back is a surprise, and the narrow layout made for a nice intimate atmosphere.   For apps we went for the specials - the crab-corn soup was nothing to 'oo' and 'ah' about, but the calamari and mussels were delicious. For the mains, we enjoyed the lamb chops (succulent, tender, perfect), the halibut (fennel-encrusted, interesting and very good), and the seafood pasta (scallops, salmon, shrimp) which was done in a subtly spicy marinara. Yummmm... Desserts were, as recommended, the made-in-house creme brule and tiramisu. All in all - food is stellar, albeit far too overpriced. The mains all seem to be about $10 more expensive than they should be.  In terms of service, our waitress was great - friendly, joking around, and relatively attentive considering the busy night.   However, this is where the 4 star becomes a 3 star. When one of our party suddenly fell very obviously ill before dessert (unrelated to food), our server suddenly avoided us altogether. No offerings of water or even a simple, civil \"How are you feeling?\". In fact, a busboy brought us the bill and packed up our leftover dessert while she was obviously still around. Not a single staff member offered any assistance but just stared as we helped her limp out.   Hey, maybe that's just a downtown thing but just because you work in a sort-of-trendy-ish-not-really part of town, but that doesn't mean that puts you above being a functional human being. Sheesh, city folk!"}
{"text":"Food is a little bit pricey, but I think that's what you can expect in the area.  Food and service were both pretty good. I had the pasta primavera and a caprese salad, pasta was great, and although the salad was good, I've also had much better and probably wouldn't order it again. I'd probably come back."}
{"text":"The Osso Bucco was perfect and was a great complement to the fettucine. I would go there again not only for the lamb shank but also for Kit Kat's lively atmosphere."}
{"text":"Kit Kat had some awesome food. We had three different dishes and we enjoyed all of them. The wine list was super extensive and the atmosphere is sweet. Like open concept kitchen in middle of restaurant sweet. We were warned that the by the glass wine wasn't good and if you want the good stuff, you have to buy a bottle. However service was nothing special. It certainly wasn't terrible, and the hostess and doorman were great, but actual service felt impersonal and was just wasn't anything to write home about."}
{"text":"The tables are too close together. You are basically sitting with strangers at your table so its not enjoyable at all cant have a conversation. Food was okay."}
{"text":"Very tight space. Foods are below average, ribs are toooo sweet. Guy waiter was not friendly at all, it seems he was pissed off with everybody. Pricy for the foods. Avoid this place at all cost."}
{"text":"The restaurant is small but the staff is friendly and the food was good. The portions are pretty good as well (my husband and I shared a pasta dish)."}
{"text":"great food and service. it's just a bit pricey. Remember to try the grilled calamari in specials."}
{"text":"If you don't mind being harassed while spending your money you will like this place and the food. The place is very small and has been around for almost 30 years. When we arrived we waited at the bar and the bartender was rather rude. We got a table quickly and our waiter was very nice and had a very unique way to recite the specials. I had fettuccini Alberto and my husband had penne with sausage. The fettuccini was reach and creamy, the flavor of the cheeses was very distinct. The sausage was spicy and very flavorful. We didn't have dessert since the portions were very generous however, I got a cappuccino and it was also very good too.  We set close to the entrance. It was a great opportunity for people watching and also to see how they were not friendly to their clients. If you are like me and like your food better than making friends you will like this place."}
{"text":"Last time I went to Kit Kat was 12 years ago.  I was pregnant at the time and didn't get to enjoy a nice glass of wine with my dinner.  Tonight I went to Kit Kat with that very boy I was pregnant with.    Upon entering the restaurant we were asked to shut the outside door before we are allowed into the actual restaurant.  Very kindly of course.  But it made sense as there are 4 duo occupancy tables directly inside the front of the restaurant.  We let the kindly Italian gentleman know that we were two.  He asked if we were in a hurry; we said no.  He directed us to the bar to wait on a table, which wouldn't take long.  He took our coats - I was hoping I'd get it back at the end of the night (especially since I left my car keys in there).  We only waited about 10 minutes when I received a tap and a \"Bella, your table is ready\"... sigh to still be called Bella :-)  We sat down to a nice dinner.  Child of mine gorged on Garlic Bread with Cheese.  He had Fettucini Alberto - 4 cheese with fettucini which he got most of to go.  I had Veal Piccatta - which was delicious!  But missing the capers. And a nice glass of Chianti - how Italian.  I think the best part of the experience was the service, and the food was adequate, but a little pricey.  I guess that's to be expected on King St.  It's actually a great location directly across from Tiff Bell Lightbox.  Perfect in its location.  And at the end of the night, my coat was safe and sound... car keys and all."}
{"text":"This is a terrible restaurant. The service IS TERRIBLE. We had a 7:00pm reservation which they called and changed to a 7:30pm res which was fine - I was glad they were being proactive but we got there at 7:30pm and told to stand at the bar. The bartender dislikes her job or her life - either way, she should not be in the service industry. We didn't hear anything from anyone except being jostled at the bar as people tried to walk by us for a good 30 minutes, they didn't even tell us what the situation was. Finally, I went and asked and they said that the people at our table were paying. Another 10 minutes later with no news - we left. We tried to get the bartender's attention to pay but she was in a conversation with a friend at the end of the bar and hadn't bothered to check in with us since we had flagged her down to take a drink order at the beginning. So we left $10 for two drinks - clearly, that wasn't enough but we didn't care because of the terribly poor service. We went next door - only to be chased down by the maitre D and told we didn't pay enough. If only he cared that much about serving us. This restaurant is on King street across from the theatres and so it doesn't have to provide any level of service as it's always full. I can't comment on the food - but I assure you if you walk two blocks the service will improve ten fold."}
{"text":"Really disappointing.  We went to a film screening at the TIFF Bell Lightbox across the road from this restaurant, and instead of getting something to eat at one of the restaurants at the cinema we decided to grab a bite at one of the restaurants across the road.  There is a whole group of restaurants that have been there for years, but neither my wife nor myself have ever been in all the years we have lived in Toronto.  After going this one time we won't be going back.  The food was average at best, and the atmosphere was really unenjoyable.  The staff were doing their best but you could tell they hated working there.  It's a really run down, tired restaurant going through the motions and charging way too much for the desperately average food.  There are so many better options in the area, which we will be going to next time we are in the vicinity."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place on King's street. When going in the door was locked. I'm sure because of the weather it was really cold out. They waited for us to close the outside door then let us in.   We didn't go for the show. We didn't even realize they were even having one. We got sat shortly after arriving. They had appetizers, entrees and desserts on special. We ordered the halibut and veggie pasta(I'm sure they had a fancy name for this I just can't remember). Both specials of the day.   The halibut was delicious. $40 it came with a wild rice. Crusted and pan seared. We enjoyed! The veggie pasta was ravioli $15 stuffed with a roasted sweet potato. Served with a roasted eggplant in a red sauce. It was very good! It was better than the fish. I would definitely go back again for that pasta.   What I really like was they had multiple house wines(red) to choose from. I'm thinking at least 6. That was just red. Never looked at the white. Don't drink it. That's so abnormal. I'm use to one house red one house white.    It's a bit small but very comfortable. We didn't feel crowded. We sat by the bar and they kept people from crowing around that area."}
{"text":"The food was exceptional, we had mussels and one of the specials of the evening. We were in from out of town and our concierge recommended it. He should have told us to make a reservation because it was packed and they sat all reservations and we waited about an hour. It was very clear that not everyone is okay with this. It was a Saturday night so I wasn't surprised by the wait, we sat at the bar and got drinks but every third person was excessively complaining about the wait and being confused. If you go out to a small restaurant on a Saturday that should just be expected. Everyone was very nice and as I said the food was great. It was a cool place, a bit loud, but that's to be expected. Don't listen to the reviews about service or waiting for a table. Make a reservation and you'll have a solid evening."}
{"text":"We went to Kit Kat, just as probably everybody does, before attending a show in the Theatre District, and under some time constraints with a group of 6 people.   Our server was extremely helpful and friendly. After hanging our coats, seating us, and taking drink orders, she indicated what menu items would take shorter or longer times and fit our time constraints to get to our show. She also listed off a monumental list of specials with detailed descriptions that might better have been delivered in printed format because I had forgotten the earlier specials as she went on.  There was an excellent selection of wine. I do dispute the Yelp rating of $$ for the pricing because if you select any 2 courses (app and main, or main and dessert) it will likely come to over $30 before drinks. I personally rate the pricing as $$$.  Pricing aside, the group were happy with their food. I split a caesar salad with my accompaniment and we found it was appropriately sized for 2 people before receiving our main courses.   I had the Osso Bucco Milanese. It said on the menu that it is served with fettucine. I love Osso Bucco for the bone marrow. I had never had it like this before. It was in an acidic tomato sauce and served over the fettucine.   My previous experiences with Osso Bucco have been in a red-wine au jus with root vegetables and potatoes, which I think I prefer; but this was nice to try for something different.  The meat was tender and the shank bone crosscut was large. Another member of our group ordered the same thing; but he got 2 smaller bones and he was too polite to pick up the bones to get to the marrow since his utensils would not fit. Poor him! I never let politeness or cleanliness get between my food and my belly.  Part-way through our meal, an older man came by to ask us how everything was and to refill our wine glasses from the bottle on the end of the table. My date told me that she saw him on a CBC documentary recently called \"The Condo Game\" and that he fought to retain the restaurant strip on King Street in the theatre district and prevent it from becoming the service-less, character-less style of Fleet Street west.  My date had the seafood linguine and said it was delicious. I didn't manage to do any food sharing on this particular outing, so I'll have to take her word for it; but she also mentioned that the server and owner were exceptionally friendly.  For me the food was average good food; but the server and owner elevated the experience. I hope to return to try their pastas or veal chop next time."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner here.  Tables are a bit cramped, but that's status quo for the city.  Great spot to meet up with friends, or have a romantic dinner, provided you don't mind if your neighbors hear your conversations.  The food was fabulous -- we shared the pasta for two.  The service was really great, too.  I'd absolutely have dinner here again."}
{"text":"Just finished eating. I had farfale with smoked duck in spicy rosé. It was hands down the best pasta I have ever had. Including my grandma's, god rest her. The wine list was extensive and amazing! The service was perfect. Definitely the best dining experience I've had. You must eat here!"}
{"text":"Great little place for a nice date! I loved the rustic authentic feel. I had just appetizers and wine, but will return!"}
{"text":"I was out with a friend a few weeks ago and we had just finished watching the fights and were looking for a place with some decent food at around 11:00PM on a Saturday night.  As we walked down King Street back to my place, my friend said, \"Let's go to the Kit Kat, I know you will love this place\". I replied \"Sure, sounds good.\"  We walked in and got seated right at the window, it was not that busy being that late, but it was still open and serving food, which was awesome.  The server told us the Specials and after glancing over the menu, I decided upon a Seafood Pasta with a Rose sauce Special.  And we shared a few apps as well.  Well I was not prepared at all for the magnificence of the dish I ordered, I was really taken aback at how great it was. My friend was smiling all the time, he'd been going here for a few months now and had never mentioned this place to me before.  Now, my experiences could be unique to that night, but the service was excellent, the manager/owner dropped by the table a few times to see how things were.  I am REALLY looking forward to heading back there soon and trying another dish one of these evenings."}
{"text":"Sunday evening , stumbling with stilettos me and a few girlfriends spot the tiny doorway to Kit Kat and decide to go in. Initially the cozy atmosphere is what drew me in.   The place was adorable, like your aunts house you'd visit for gigantic family dinners. Loud Italian conversations going on, woody stairs leading down to the basement (bathrooms), random candles (red light makes smudgy eyeliner look sexy - whatever, it does), plastic vines all over the furniture and parts of the ceiling.   The drinks were made well. I had 2 rounds of amaretto sour. They were mixed well and sugary enough to keep me sipping on them at regular intervals. A few other drinks ordered (highly recommend) - Soho Lychee & Ginger ale (I came up with this concoction at a random gay club that really didn't have many options and Voila! now its the loveliest drink of all time). For sugary drink lovers - ^_^  DO try it. and let me know how you find it   The dinner order: - - - - Apps:  Organic Greens with Balsamic Vinaigrette - YuMMMMerss Goat Cheese Salad with Organic Greens - a tad watery :( Bruschetta - we tried to be \"safe\" - at an Italian eatery - I know.Ridiculous.    Mains: Pasta - Angelhair Basilico  tomato sauce & fresh basil +chkn - YUMM, perfect quantity of sauce & chicken.  Roast Lemon Chicken, served with potato & vegetables - Amazing. My fav dinner. Healthy, veggies cooked well (without salt & butter), chicken tender and came in already cut in tiny portions ^_^ Rack of Lamb+ jumbo tiger shrimp &Warm Scallop Salad - it was cooked well , but I found the shrimp to be a bit cold . Apparently they do that on purpose.   Desert: Tirami'su - YUM.  Chocolate Raspberry Tartuffo - Myeh Carrot Cake, cream cheese & honey icing - I decided to try this because I absolutely love carrot cake. It was ....different. It felt powdery at times. I can only assume it was kept out for a while?!? - How would old cake taste like??..  All in all, the server was sweet and very catering. She suggested quite a bit and was honest about what NOT to order. I would def go back again. Also, Its a great date place. With how loud & busy it is, you would never feel awkward. ;)  M."}
{"text":"We did not have a reservation, but the owner/manager got us a table right away, with the stipulation that we finish in an hour because he had a reservation coming in at that time. That was great!! Vivian was our waitress. She memorized our order and recited it back to us perfectly. My wife ordered the angel hair with tomato and basil. My son and daughter had the same but with chicken. I had the penne with spicy Italian sausage.   We ordered a Caesar salad to share as well as an order of garlic bread. The salad was very good. The garlic bread was oily, probably olive oil, but no discernible garlic, but a nice texture.  My pasta sauce was too salty, but good flavor. The sausage was spicier than any other I have ever had. Everyone else had a good sauce, not salty like mine.  Service was just ok too. The owner/manager was great, engaging me in conversation as busy as he was."}
{"text":"A big calzone A mediocre sample platter A nice patio  Fun fact: The patio is a pretty spot for the summer wine fueled nights. Capisco Sad fact: I did not find a single Kit Kat on the menu Win fact: The pasta"}
{"text":"We went there for lunch before Second City.  It was very cold so we didn't take a long time to pick a restaurant and we weren't familiar with other places on King St.  I had seafood linguine and my husband had pasta primavera with the tomato cream sauce.  Portions were good-sized and tasty.  I also had a salad which was fresh and had a good variety of lettuces.  We ordered a bottle of wine.  We sat in a booth in the back and did not feel cramped in spite of the tight space.  My only issue was with the Tiramisu which was dry and not particularly flavorful."}
{"text":"Polenta with Gorgonzola and marinara with sausage was my favorite! We were staying at the Hyatt down the street and it's a short walk across the street. The place is really small, I think they had more tables in the back behind the kitchen but I didn't look. My husband enjoyed his ribs and I got a pasta that was very good too. I wanted the chicken Parmesan that I saw on the online menu but they didn't have it on the menu when we got there, oh well it was still very good and if I'm ever make in Toronto I'll stop in again."}
{"text":"I went to Kit Kat a while back on a very special first date. We hadn't made a reservation, as the plan was to take a stroll downtown and to pick whatever place caught our eye (no one wants to be too pushy with restaurant preferences on a first date right?).   Kit Kat looked perfect for the occasion, and we were able to get a table on an early Saturday evening with no problem. Well... There was no problem with getting the table, but the table itself was a bit of a different story. Like most of the restaurants on that King West strip, Kit Kat is tiny and narrow. So be forewarned that you may be brushing arms with the couple also on their first date sitting right next to you. In some situations this may not be the end of the world. For example, 1) If your date is not going well, the date next to you can provide welcome entertainment; 2) If your date is going very well, you likely will not notice anything around you. We were in the #2 category.   Service at Kit Kat was great, and the food was even better. We started off with bruschetta, and then I had the pasta with salmon and a vodka rose sauce (yummy). It looked so good that my date didn't hesitate to ask to dig his fork into my pasta for a taste (on a first date?). He had the Four Cheese Fettuccine and raved about his choice as well. The portions were very hearty, and we both had more than enough left on our plates to take home as leftovers for the next day.   All in all, the experience was great. I would highly recommend Kit Kat for a date or a night out with a girlfriend. Not so much so for group dinners, as you may be sitting on one another's laps."}
{"text":"Had the butternut squash special and the veal piccata. Both were delicious and the servers were super nice and accommodating!"}
{"text":"Ate here with two friends and my son for lunch during TIFF. Delayed review but had such a pleasant encounter with the owner in dealing with us I wanted to be sure to put it up. We arrived during a very busy service, and initially the server outside informed us there would be a delay of about 40 minutes. He left us then outside, and as we stood debating waiting, the owner (sitting at a nearby table ) told us he'd get us a table quicker. He got the staff to set up a table immediately outside, with space beside me for the stroller. Very pleasant chatting to us while this was done. I was really impressed as most places, including themselves, were extremely busy and most other restaurants in the area were not willing to give over so much space for prams. He did so very graciously, and it was very much appreciated.  Just to note, we ate outside and I never looked at the inside. However my friends did say it's nice but narrow.  Server for our table was busy but friendly and attentive. Advised about food and wine well. Reasonably priced meal for the bistro type food. The food was very good and arrived promptly, particularly given how busy it was.  Really nice experience- this was a very busy week in the area and often restaurants make you feel unwelcome with kids at times like that. Really liked the personal approach"}
{"text":"The food was decent, not great.  Service was terrible. I asked the waitress for wine suggestions (the wines on the menu were between $8.5 - $10/glass, as best I recall).  She suggested a Malbec.  What came was akin to a glass of vinegar.  I took one sip and it sat.  For my entire, lengthy meal.  I was dining solo, on business travel.  My salad came, I enjoyed it.  Then sat with my fork and knife on my plate for a good 10 minutes to indicate I was finished as she passed several times without stopping.  I even pulled out my phone to catch up on the latest social media garbage to indicate that I was no longer eating.  Subtle hint not taken.  Then finally bartender saw my look of disdain and got her attention.  She returned to my table and asked if I needed anything.  I said I'd like to order dinner.  \"Oh?  Okay!\"  She had gone over the specials earlier and I had decided on one.  I said, \"I think I'll go with the smoked chicken (whatever it was).  How is that?\"  \"Honestly, it's not very good.  The goat cheese pasta is good.\"  Now, I hadn't previously mentioned this, but my salad had a hockey puck-size brick of goat cheese on it.  I said, \"I think I've actually had my fill of goat cheese this evening.  I'll go with the smoked chicken (whatever).\"  Again - full glass of wine still sitting there.  She hasn't mentioned it, asked if there's a problem with it, how I'm enjoying it.  Nothing.  Entrée comes, it's good.  I finish and she asks if I'd like a dessert menu.  I decline and she says, \"Oh, I'll let you enjoy your wine then.\"  I say, \"No, I'm not really enjoying it.  Just the bill, please.\"  Bill comes.  $12.50 for the awful wine.  She upsold me on bad wine.  I question it but she just stands there awkwardly.  I could have made a fuss, but I really just wanted to leave.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Surprised I hadn't tried here before my recent visit, on an overcast Wednesday in late December.  My partner and I decided that morning that we'd meet for lunch somewhere on the King West strip, and after browsing a few outdoor menus, we chose here.  We walked in and the place was narrow, as expected from outside.  But it's VERY narrow.  The restaurant only has a few tables at the front, and then a bar that runs a large distance of the left-hand side toward the back, an open kitchen that is squished also on the left-hand side, to more tables in the rear.  The front has natural lighting coming in from the street windows.  The back has a skylight to allow more natural lighting in as well.  The walls are bombarded with random signage, artwork and fun decor.  (see my pics).  Service is friendly.  It took quite awhile for our food to arrive, but it was okay for us that day since we were on vacation.  If you were here on a lunch hour during work, this may be an issue.  Free basket of white bread with packets of butter.  Quite tasty Caesar salad (8.95 with a toasted piece of garlic bread/crostini) was just right.  My partner tried their daily steak special, which I don't have a written description of, but he loved it.  The steak was cooked to perfection, big enough to be filling, quality enough to recommend, with caramelized mushrooms? and side of sauteed veggies, which we think was $21.  I tried the Fusili Gorgonzola (spinach and cream sauce 13.95), which looked bland, but was tasty and very filling.  There was no way we'd be able to force down a dessert after our meal.  My only complaint was that this place may not be accessible to people with disabilities, as they definitely had no elevator down to the basement to use the washrooms.  The stairs themselves were narrow and steep, so even a person after too much alcohol would probably struggle.  Luckily I was here for lunch, so that wasn't an issue!  lol  I'd go back anytime!  The prices were great for what we had."}
{"text":"I licked my plate clean. I'd never done that in a restaurant before. And I don't know what was in my wine but I practically floated back to my hotel room. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Cramped, overpriced, very busy. Probably caters mainly to out of town tourists who want to eat 1 block from their Broadway musical. The food is OK but not spectacular- basic mid/late 20th Century Americanised version of Italian food. Would have given 3 stars but the undrinkable glass of water which had an incredibly strong chemical/chlorine smell and taste."}
{"text":"Overrated. We waited for almost 1hr for our food to arrive even though it was a quiet dinner."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant for early evening or late night meals.  We've been coming here off and on for years and love the penne with spicy Italian sausage."}
{"text":"I love restaurants like this. It's a charming hole-in-the-wall with great food, great atmosphere and great service. Bruschetta was good, my mixed greens with goat cheese salad was delicious. My wife and daughter loved the Caesar salad. I ordered a duck pasta entree that blew me away. I left nothing on the plate sopping up the sauce with a piece of bread. My wife and daughter loved their seafood pasta. Our waitress, Victoria, was great, pairing a perfect bottle of wine with our meals. She is funny, attentive, and deserves a huge raise. Despite the fact that we were stuffed, we all ordered dessert and once again we were delighted with our choices. We had a great time. Thanks Victoria."}
{"text":"A bit overpriced for the quality of the food. Came here for a work social and ordered an array of items  Calamari - we wwre told it was a favourite. It wasn't a traditional deep fried calamari. Was cold and I didn't like the fact that you had to slice a giant piece of non-deep fried squid and then eat it with a spinach salad  Veal - wasnt medium rare, tough to cut and there wasn't anything too impressive about the meat or how it was prepared - came with mashed potatoes and grilled veggies, pretty standard  Ribeye - again, wasn't medium rare, tough to cut and it was prepared quite similarly to the veal. Same sides  This raw beef appetizer - served with slices of Parmesan. Had a decent taste and soft texture. Probably one of the better tasting items compared to the mains.  Service definitely took a while - just from ordering drinks to getting our apps served to getting our mains. We were there from 6:30pm til 9pm.  Would possibly come back one more time, and to try something completely different"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this little restaurant. We had the seafood linguine and the calamari. If you like Italian and unique atmosphere this is a must try."}
{"text":"Been to a lot of Italian restaurants, this place is up there with the best. Setting is a pleasant environment. Not too loud. Not too fancy. Perfect for dining alone, with friends, or a quiet couples night out. Food was so tastefully prepared. Nothing too busy or eccentric but certainly creative and delicious. The service was perfect. Super friendly but not in a fake saccharine way. They made helpful recommendations and timed everything perfect. Could not have had a more perfect night. Had the angel hair bascilico and my wife had the salmon.  The wine was a Napa blend and perfect. There's probably more trendy (i.e. expensive) places out there, but this place was perfect for us. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Our first stop in Toronto was Kit Kat. I was starved and they had outside seating for my dog. Score!  The Caesar was tasty and the garlic crouton made me wish I had ordered the garlic bread!  The bolognese was terrific and the pasta was al dente! Desert was also a hit. Chocolate fudge cake and vanilla caramel ice cream. So good.  The best part? The service. They make sure to get you out ASAP if you are seeing a show. If not, you hang out like family. Thank you Al, Giovanni and Carla for a warm welcome. xoxo"}
{"text":"Food is expensive. The food is good but the quantity is surprisingly less for the price. Should be rated at a higher price range"}
{"text":"Good place in entertainment district that is not too expensive. VERY close quarters, so if you want space you will want to go elsewhere. There are about 2 inches between the tables in the back of the restaurant. Servers are nice. Food is good. Convenient location. It needs TLC and a good cleaning, bathrooms are...well, rundown and dirty. I came here because I stay across the street at a hotel. It's likely one of those places where if you are there all the time you overlook these things. It's fine. I would go again."}
{"text":"If I could give you zero, I would have. Weird guy with a dog walks in after we stood there for a few minutes. Hands us off to another weirdo that promptly sits my son and I in the very back table. There were plenty of regular tables. But here we sat in some weird nook out the back.  After we sat there for 5 minutes without a greeting we walked out.  By the way, we are in town from Southern California for a tennis tournament. We were ready to celebrate a great day watching the world's best.  Bummer this place was recommended. We would have been a good sized check and tip heavier than most."}
{"text":"I was here with my partner for a late dinner about 2 weeks ago on a Thursday evening. We ordered a bottle of the house Chianti and an antipasto misto to start. I followed it with the baked goat cheese salad which was a fair size, and my partner had a modified pasta that the server recommended. We both really enjoyed everything and the service was very nice. We sat in the back and there was only one other table so it was nice and quiet. If you like more of a noisier atmosphere the front area always seems to be full."}
{"text":"This place is really great. The dishes are flavourful and the restaurant has a convincing Italian air. They even have gluten-free options (not that this is of consequence to me but I know that it is for others). So, why 4 stars? Staff are always knowledgeable... but always in the weeds.  I also wait for my table often despite having made a reservation. This is a busy place. It's perhaps not great for a first date, as the atmosphere is loud and all the tables are seated really closely together.However, I think this would be ideal for a small group of 4-6 with lively conversation as a stop before or after an event in the area."}
{"text":"The food at our table of 6 was all consistent, warm and served quickly. What this place might lack in choices it makes up for with service and speed. Not the best Italian but if I found myself with not a lot of time in the area again I'd go back."}
{"text":"Service we received was excellent and the food was phenomenal. We got the polenta with gruyere which was incredible and fettucini Alberta and fettucini zarina- both pastas we were happy to take home as leftovers!"}
{"text":"Short review: Extremely overpriced. They charge for soda refills. Stay away.  Details: I am usually a balanced reviewer but honestly this place does deserve one star. When you are seated the first thing they ask you is if you want to start with sparkling water ($$) then when you have the menu on your hand they ask you if you want to have a green salad to start ($$) Pasta dishes are above 20 dollars and main dishes between 28 and 37. People in the table next to us were clever and they only had the bottle of water, paid and left. We order two sodas, with one refill (+$) and two dishes of pasta. It was over 50 dollars.  It is clear that this business is struggling and they are banking on their location in front of the TIFF. There are better places for Italian food in Toronto. I won't mention any here because I don't want you to think I am biased. Honestly, stay away! Food here is not so great an the prices are inflated. I felt bad that first: there are people like the ones who run this business trying to trick you and second: that we fell for it."}
{"text":"The desserts were delicious and the service very good. Unfortunately one needed a saw instead of a knife to cut through the pork \"tenderloin.\" but hey, what do you expect for only $24.50 plus tax? *cough*"}
{"text":"I went to Kit Kat's on a double date in November of 2011.  Had been there for lunch a dozen times or so because it's close to my work, and while never overly impressed with the service, the food was decent.  My last experience however is easily the worse I have ever had at a restaurant.  It started with ordering a bottle of wine ('07 Niagara vintage) which our served advised was out of stock, but that the '08 was available.  We thouht nothing of it and agreed to take the younger wine.  The meal arrived late (we were going to a local theatre and had advised them as such -if you are considering Kit Kat for a pre-theatre dinner, beware as they completely overshot our timelines and we missed our show) but the worse part was the bill.  The server failed to inform us that the younger vintage was actually $30 more expensive than the bottle we had previsouly ordered.  We were of course not advised of this so it came as a bit of a surprise.  To give you a little contest, the 4 of us at dinner are all well-employed, downtown professionals in our mid-30's so $30 isn't a deal breaker but the matter of principle definitely is.  When we asked to see the manager, he came over and would not even allow us to explain our situation saying \"I know what's happening here\" and expected us to pay the extra $30.  As you can imagine, this turned into quite the heated discussion and after being extremely rude, the manager ended-up offering to \"split the difference\".  Either way, the damage was done.  It put a real negative spin on our night and I will NEVER go back to this restaurant again.  In this day of customer service, I don't know how a restauranteur can justify arguing with his customers over a discrepancy like this but, as they say, what goes around comes around."}
{"text":"Simply amazing.  No menu, just specials.  The ambiance is a 10, food a 9.  Everything is fresh!"}
{"text":"We arrived in Toronto too late to make our reservation that was previously booked and we were very disappointed. The hotel recommended kit kat and boy were we glad! Everything was excellent and they accommodated the 8 of us with 3 hours notice. Very authentic food, incredible service, a must eat at place! Very small but bustling place ,stayed full but we weren't rushed out. A truly incredible find and a meal that we will remember!!"}
{"text":"A few minutes from our hotel was Kit Kat.  You walk in thru this cool double door that opens both doors as you enter. Inside you are treated to warm colors and a comfy feeling. Immediately, a smiling host greets you and leads you down the narrow path to tummy heaven.  You pass the wine bar, that is good looking in its own right; and they in the back it's 15 foot A-frame ceilings with glass. Lot's of sun comes in for the open airy experience.  I ordered the rotini with gorgonzola sauce, comes with bit's of onions, parsley and some spinach. The pasta tasted freshly made. From the way it looked to it's taste, I found this plate a bargain at $12.95. After you order they bring you some crusty bread with some fine butter.  Décor: cool, casual and special.  Customer service: fine."}
{"text":"Beef carpaccio on point! Delicious Caesar salad and the past was also on point! Loved the atmosphere, the service and everything about this place!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by the hotel concierge so we gave it a try. It's a cozy place and we were greeted by pretty much the entire staff.  Nice start.  The service is top notch.  Very attentive and got help from more than one person. The food was very good.  I had the penne with sausage and that was good.  I was in the mood for spaghetti and meatballs, but they don't have it.  I wish the portions were a little bigger but then again there wouldn't have been room for dessert. I had the tiramisu.   Everything was good and the service shined.  It's not the best Italian food I had but very, very good.I would go back if I were in Toronto again.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Good meal for the money. Wait staff is lacking in service, but the authentic Italian cuisine made up for it."}
{"text":"Hey guys, what's up ?   I was wondering around King, then suddenly we decided to move a restaurant. There were couple of restaurants around there, so we moved in this restaurant. (As if you are going to care)   My actually review is in a positive way, in spite of my family perspective. So first off, if you do not like loud and dark illuminating, probably you will dislike that place, even though meals are good.   I ate Cassa soup, bruschetta and New York angus, basically I got satisfied what I ate. I highly recommend you to get this angus, which was totally yummy and soft. Basically, that's oblivious a good restaurant, if you are looking for a more mild and less tense. There are lots of alternatives out there, however that restaurant deserves 3.5 out of 5..........,"}
{"text":"I've been here I think 3 or 4 times.  It's a really cozy almost too cozy place.  If you are claustrophobic I recommend you skip this place because it is like eating on a submarine!  While the space is tight the atmosphere and ambiance is still very nice.    Because of the lack of space I found the place can get a little noisy at times in that you can basically hear every conversation within earshot all at once.   Still the food is average for an Italian eatery but the service is well above average.  The owners and staff make you feel welcome and that serving you is really their pleasure.    The portion sizes are average but I can't say I've left wishing the servings were larger.    The last time I was there I had the linguine with scallops, shrimps, clams and basil."}
{"text":"After a \"practically perfect\" night out care of Mary Poppins, me and my 2 theatre going  friends came in here looking for drinks. Hey Lucy seemed a bit crowded and the \"people love us on yelp\" sticker on the window of Kit Kat beckoned to me and this 2 star review is purely based on my experience in coming here in the hopes of having a nice drink or two.  I know that Kit Kat is a predominantly food based location and not a bar or a lounge of sorts, but being on this stretch of King Street they really should have been more accommodating to people looking for a drink. We were asked to sit at the bar when there were tables ready which clearly were meant to be occupied by hungry people only and the lack of a proper cocktail menu was also a disappointment They did have a wine list that seemed pretty comprehensible but I never got a close look at it. I asked the bartender to serve me up a \"not too sweet\" martini and she did a good job on that front, but tasted like a cough syrup which I was in no mood for unfortunately.   Service overall was not as friendly as it should have been and that was a disappointment as well.  I'm sure Kit Kat has the ability to dish out a proper evening experience for a proper dinner, but just as a location to come to for a drink I give it 2 stars with the prospects of visiting again for food high."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, place looks like it belongs in the suburban neighbourhood....more like a Jack Astor's"}
{"text":"Had not been to Kit Kat recently but stopped in last week for an early dinner. Still the same small space and gregarious owner. Had the calamari appetizer and seafood pasta main. Food was very good and the service fast and friendly. A consistently good choice although can be hard to get a table around theatre time."}
{"text":"I came here before going to see a comedy show at the ACC. I'd seen the sign before so I thought I'd give it a try, me & my partner were both delightfully surprised! We didn't have any expectations but he food was great, service was fast and the atmosphere was so cute & authentic. I got the vegetable ravioli (the spinach & cheese filling was great) and my partner got the smoked salmon pasta - it was SO good. I had a few bites & loved it! The sauce was so creamy!"}
{"text":"Very underrated Italian. Pastas, fish, and veal chop were delicious. Service was great and the atmosphere was classic Italian. I recommend this place for every dish and a great casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"Cute little Italian spot. A girlfriend and I stumbled by here one late night after attending an event. We shared a pasta dish, I forget what it's called but it had tomatoes, spinach & chicken in a cream/cheese sauce. It was delicious and a good portion for us to share, although compared to other restaurants it's a little on the smaller side. We ended up splitting the creme brulee as well and to this day I still dream about it. It was one of the best I've ever had and I will come back just to have it again."}
{"text":"Haven't been here for a while and we decided to have dinner here before the show at the Royal Alex on Saturday night.   We ordered grilled calamari and calpesse  salad for appetizers. Debra said her calamari was good....not as nice as in Italy but it was good. I actually had more of an expectation for the salad maybe some heirloom tomatoes and soft Buffalo mozzarella, but  it was just a regular hothouse tomato with Boccaccini cheese but that was not the case and the tiny teaspoon of basil in there it was OK I wouldn't order it again.   Four main courses we had the duck special with Arrigotti pasta and and the penne with spicy sausage. They were amazing but the portions were huge and we could have shared they were that large.   All in all dinner was fantastic ! Service was outstanding !"}
{"text":"Great for a cozy lunch or dinner but maybe not for a large group.  We were a group of 8 and although they did their best to accommodate us, 2 of us were sitting in the middle of the main walkway so when they were seating other diners, we had to move our chairs.  That said, I've always enjoyed the pasta dishes.  A few of our group (including an Italian who knows his pasta) found the dishes a bit salty but I thought they were pretty yummy."}
{"text":"Kit Kat delivered a great experience. I got one of the seafood pastas, and it was delicious. Al dente, it had a great amount of seafood, it tasted great. The server checked on us, and was friendly and took the time to go through the plates that were on special that evening. The place is a little small and it can get crowded and a little loud. Besides that, I think its a great place to go and to have in mind whenever you are visiting the area."}
{"text":"It's very confuse to comment this place. I didn't like it when I walked in because no one letting me know how long the table will be. But it was very quick after 10 min. We was some how surprising that it's was faster then we thought. The food was not bad but couldn't rate it high. The place was nice if you like the traditional style. Would I come back again? Maybe."}
{"text":"In my opinion, if not for its location, Kit Kat would not survive.  I've been twice in the past year, and each time I've been disappointed entirely.   Grilled Polenta appetizer - cold in the middle.   Fettucine with smoked salmon and rose sauce - salty, salty, salty, and runny, runny, runny. It was like cooked noodles in a salty orange soup with maybe three flecks of smoked salmon.   Finally, the service is sub par at best. And when the place is jammed, forgetaboutit--the servers tag-team their service with the diner's themselves passing dishes to and fro. It's ridiculous for the prices they charge.  The food, the service, nowhere near the value for the price paid. What you're paying for is the location. That's it. If you're going to a show, or live nearby, then sure, why not, but don't make the effort otherwise."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced small Italian in very busy neighbourhood.  Wait was short on a Wednesday night (8PM), table for 4.  Staff were attentive, friendly without being too intrusive.  Nice wine list , and reasonable by the glass selection.  Food was good and certainly worth coming back for a second try."}
{"text":"lazy sunday with my bf... this restaurant being in entertainment district i didn't know what to expect, it's either gonna be tourist trap or hidden gem for the locals.. well, it turned out to be pretty cozy with pretty good food.  angel hair pasta with chicken and penne with italian sausage were pretty good.. overall decent place to go if you are stuck in the entertainment district..  i can name a few better italian restaurants in the similar price range, but would give four star for having a cozy setting and good service.."}
{"text":"Amazing. Every bite  had flavor, taste, and triggered a different part of your tasting abilites. The atmosphere was like New York City. Tight dining quarters makes.for.new.friends. Truly one of the best meals.I have ever had. My family came here from Sicily and I know great Italian food. This is great Italian food with a family atmosphere."}
{"text":"Not enough words to describe how delicious their food is! I loved it. My husband and I both got the same thing. I believe it was called the Penne with Spicy Italian Sausage and tomato sauce."}
{"text":"We had the perfect dinner experience here. The days special orecchiette smoked chicken with the rose sauce was as good as it gets. The atmosphere was warm and intimate adding to the experience. We loved it here"}
{"text":"Great experience. Both of our servers were amazing with recommendations and taking charge for someone who is indecisive aka me. I had a special that was goat cheese ravioli in rose sauce which was cooked perfectly al dente. The Malbec from Niagara Homegrown Megalomaniac was SO GOOD and cheap. Also, you might spot a Maple Leaf eating there -- Nylander was there when we were.  Will go back if I'm in Toronto again!"}
{"text":"Visiting for work - we had dinner for 6 - we had great service - good food - very cozy but I love the atmosphere - we shared apps - I had the ahi tuna- perfectly seared - deserts are really nice and of course limoncello !!!"}
{"text":"We have been living in Toronto for 5 years and have been coming here since. We LOVE this place. Food and service is incredible. Sitting at a outside table during summer is outstanding experience. Last night's meal was AMAZING. Actually we recognized food is better than other Italian restaurant we have been. My husband and I go out for dinner almost every other night and this place is our number one."}
{"text":"Missed our flight out of Calgary and ended up with a 5 hour layover. Had to go into town to my favorite place. Best food and best service. Even gave the magical tree a big hug."}
{"text":"came here on friday night with some friends. nice atmosphere, super packed and pretty awesome crowd. had to make reservation for our group of six.  we had antipasti, and pasta for two. the pasta portions were large. definitely suggest sharing. the mussels in our pasta weren't the freshest but the scallop was good. other people in our group had the steak and bruchetta and they loved it. there's not a lot of variety in the menu so you can either have pasta or steak.. that's pretty much it. not a single pizza dish in an italian restaurant??? really?  i find the music was a bit loud so it was hard to have a conversation, by the end of the night my throat was sore from yelling across the table.   it was a nice place to hangout, right across from the tiff lighthouse, convenient but a bit pricy for what they have."}
{"text":"We chose to eat here after an evening visit to the AGO (free Wednesdays) and it was a good choice. The food was good: if you're having an appetizer skip the cheesy garlic bread (you can get that anywhere) and go for the gorgonzola polenta--yum!  We couldn't decide and went for both which was our own mistake. My fettuccine alberto (I don't know what happened to Alfredo--got whacked, maybe) was delicious; SO's smoked salmon fettucine was also very nice; Mom's veal piccata was a little salty, but flavorful and huge (unnecessarily so, but that's a draw for some diners).  We shared a luscious tiramisu for dessert. The staff were attentive when we had their attention but it was hard to get it a couple times.  However, that wouldn't keep me from returning, or sending a friend the next time they were in Toronto."}
{"text":"My review is purely based on service aspect of what i've experienced due to the fact that we never stayed to eat.  This review has no bearing in terms of how the food really is, though, seeing what came out of kitchen for other tables, they looked pretty good.  It was a work lunch and 5 of us went to Kit Kat.  The restaurant is very narrow but stretches long to the back where most of the seating area is.  Now, we got sat in a table for 6 and looked at the menu and specials on the chalk boards on 2 sides of the wall.  All decided to order our food yet still no one came to take the order for even drinks.. And waited...   10 min., no one out of 2 servers came to our table.   *Couple of eye contacts with those 2 servers...*   15 min... *looking around & scratching heads*   20 min.... *more eye contacts with the servers and another individual who looks to be a manager, an old lady...*   25 min. *buzzer goes off in our heads*   We all got up and left.     As we were leaving, 1 of 2 servers asks \"is there any problem?\", I say \"Yes, we've just been sitting here,  and waiting to be served for a very very long time\"...  Then the server says.. \"oh my, I forgot this was my section...\"   *sigh*  Good by Kit Kat...."}
{"text":"First things first. Do NOT follow the advice/review from someone who eats at an East Side Mario's @ Brandon D.- \"an upscale version of east side Mario's\"? Seriously?? You should stick to writing reviews for restaurant chains because it's abvious that you don't know good food even if it hit you in the face.      Anyhow- \"For us locals\", Kit Kat's food is not only AMAZING, but the ambiance is astonishing. When ever we have guests visit us from out of town/country, we take them there because we've never been dissapointed. The goat cheese salad uummm yummy! The lamb just perfect and the Alfredo pasta is always a favorite. I love this place. One of my favorites. It's a small, cozy, loud, busy restaurant, just as it should be. Just perfect!"}
{"text":"When my wife and I travel, we generally only eat at places that have been recommended by friends or those that received the highest reviews. However, we took a chance on this place while visiting the great city of Toronto and we could not have been any luckier. The food is fantastic. The place was very busy but we received great service, from beginning to end, and I can't say enough about the food. The flavors and seasoning were ideally balanced. I can't remember eating Italian food this good before."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant for the first time last night before going to see War Horse. It was the perfect venue for fashion week people watching as we were fortunate enough to score the only coveted window seat (this review might have been different if it was a cold night as the constant flow of people in and out would have made for a chilly dinner!). Started with a fresh & bright tasting bruscetta with cheese paired with a decent wine. Followed up with a crab and corn soup, and then the Tomato angel hair pasta.  The food was very good and my brother enjoyed his sausage penne very much as well.  Since we are under 30 (okay, I am actually 30 haha) we are often frequenting shiny, new restaurants but I actually really enjoyed the decor and feel of this little restaurant. The walls are filled with local celebrtiy photos and who can beat a cow sticking out of the exterior bricks? Our waiter was very warm and spent time helping us with selections. Overall, very pleased, would recommend it and come again."}
{"text":"I've always passed this place along King Street West, but never set foot into it.   After going to Mascot Brewery we decided to walk around for something close by, luckily the sign of Kit Kat Italian Bar was brightly illuminated,  The ambiance is dim yet romantic and cozy.   Our server was polite, accommodating but most of all personable.  For starters we both ordered a glass of house red to compliment an assortment of appetizers we decided to nibble on. Grilled polenta with gorgonzola, marinara sauce: was not a bad choice, loved the flavors of the grill polenta only to be complimented by the gorganzola.  Grilled calamari with a light creme; was my least favorite, however nonetheless it was enjoyable.  In terms of price, I found it a bit pricey, especially for Italian food, however again, it's the area that you're in that makes the difference.  Would I come back, probably not as I've had just as good/ or even better for half the price."}
{"text":"Nestled in a row of sub-par and sometimes outright AWFUL tourist traps near the theatres, Kit Kat can always be counted on for simple quality.  I often take visiting friends and family here since I know I can count on good, consistent food and excellent service.  I am a big fan of the pasta misto for 2 combo, especially any combo that involves the spicy sausage penne.  I know that some people complain that the pasta is not homemade, but it's expertly prepared to be al dente and is topped off with with delicious sauces and mix-ins.  I've never had a bad meal here.   The kitchen gets big points for their willingness to accommodate special requests.  I regularly ask them to change up the sauces (i.e. red or rose sauce instead of cream) or substitute ingredients, and they always do so cheerfully. The servers are always friendly and fun, too.   On your way to your table, be sure to check out the tree that grows up through the restaurant and out through the roof! Many people pass it by without even noticing.  It definitely adds some character to this King Street institution.   Finally, save room for dessert- they always have the dessert fridge fully-stocked with amazing Dufflet desserts. My favourite is the carrot cake with cream cheese icing. I'm incapable of resisting!  Great coffee, too."}
{"text":"We went on a Thursday with no reservation.  They slipped us in,  It is a TINY place,  Cute.  Hubby and I shared a brushetta (Very garlicky, which we liked) and a pasta trio for 2.  You get to choose three pasta to share family style.  We had the angel hair (fine, but pretty standard), the rigatoni bolognese (excellent) and a special-duck taggatelli.  The duck was great--quite spicy and we loved the rigatoni.  Our server was excellent. Very helpful.  Desert was fudge pecan pie.  Good but not unbelievable.  Good choice in the theater district."}
{"text":"Had a great evening and wonderful food. The restaurant is tight and a reservation is recommended. The Kit Kat is great for those also with special dietary restrictions. They are very accommodating and offer whole wheat pastas upon request. I would recommend for any couple or small group."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend went here during before a TIFF party and the food was fantastic. I had Angel Hair pasta and it was very flavour full. I could taste all the different ingredients which was nice because most places you get the main flavour of what your eating. The place is small, cozy, and very intimate which i enjoy. There wasn't any feeling of rush to eat, the service was good and the staff was very pleasant.   I would recommend going here if your ever in the area."}
{"text":"Went for dinner at 10:30 even though they don't close until 12:30am, we were rushed to place an order. Had to keep asking to get cutlery. Finally got up and got it myself. Asked three times for more bread. Servers are rude, curt and inattentive. At 12:15 the dining room lights were cranked on full brightness. Food was good. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Kit Kat is a must go to. Al and his staff are warm, friendly, professional. Food is a large portion of very fresh ingredients. Crime brûlée dessert is a must and I'd rainbow trout is on the special, order it!!!"}
{"text":"I had my second experience at Kit Kat last night after not dining there for almost two years!  With my recent move from uptown to far downtown, my apartment is just around the corner from this great Italian restaurant. With great food and close walk to take, my dad followed me as I took him to experience a great casual atmosphere with yummy meals and treats to devour.  To begin, the staff was very warm in their welcome once we walked into Kit Kat. We were seated and then greeted by our server and was told about the numerous specials. And boy, there were MANY specials!  To start, we ordered bruschetta ($6.95), which had a HUGE amount of sweet tomatoes and herbs and one caesar salad for me ($14.00) and a mixed greens salad for my dad ($8.00).  For our main courses, my dad ordered the roasted lemon chicken for $23.00. The plate came with a huge piece of chicken in a nice seasoning, along with fresh veggies grilled to perfection and some potatoes.  I ordered a pasta special - the seafood linguini with shrimp, scallops and clams, tossed with tons of veggies in a asiago cheese cream sauce. The dish was a bit on the pricey side - $22 - but it was certainly delicious and large!  For dessert, I split the creme brule with my dad for $7.95 and downed it with my decaffeinated cappucino for $5.  Overall, I was very pleased with our meal at Kit Kat. The food and the service were wonderful, but the only thing that you will have to watch out for here when you dine are the prices. The dishes are a bit more expensive than your average casual Italian restaurant.  But all in all, I would recommend it. It is definitely a yummy find!"}
{"text":"The food was awesome!! Everyone from the owner John and our server Jackie were so nice, knowledgeable and they all made you feel so welcome. We had to delay our reservation and they couldn't have been nicer!!"}
{"text":"Without much time for dinner before our next TIFF show (which ended up being pretty good!), we weren't sure we should stop somewhere other than a Subway for dinner - but we're really glad we did!  The meal offer is markedly Italian - and very delicious!  And the service was great too... the wine suggestion (plus the speed of delivery) was awesome."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! Kitchen is right in front of everyone!  Food tastes great and service is efficient.  Will be back.  Had rigatoni with sausage and their house sauce. Deelicious!!"}
{"text":"I was in Toronto for a day, visiting a new exhibit at the Aga Khan Museum. I was wandering around downtown when I decided to take a chance on this place. I am incredibly happy I did. The location can surprise you, as there is a lot more restaurant than first meets the eye. It's cozy and comfortable, with Italian stylings and some eclectic Toronto style mixed decorations that give the place some personality.  Our server was prompt, informative, polite, and most of all, very personable. Our conversations led to interesting stories of Canada from an earlier time.  The food itself was delicious. We ordered a grilled calamari appetiser. We both ordered dishes of the day, which came out rich, filling, and tasty. I had smoked chicken orecchiette with a creamy Parmesan sauce.  If you're in the neighbourhood and looking for tasty Italian fare, pop in and stay a while."}
{"text":"Came here for a GNO dinner session. We made reservations beforehand - this place is boutique-sized and gets packed very quickly during prime time. Service was extremely slow.  ANGELHAIR BASILICO - PASTA (2.5/5) (with Basil & Plum Tomato Sauce + Chicken)  This was meeeh :( I usually like angelhair pastas but the taste of this pasta became bland really quickly. The chicken bits, which I've added to my meal, were very dry and it was not marinated with the sauce of the pasta so the flavour seemed out of place."}
{"text":"Loved our dinner tonight. Wonderful service (Elizabeth), delicious food, great atmosphere and Motown tunes throughout the evening! Bucatini Bolognese and Angelhair Basilico were our favorites. We were greeted with a kind buenosera and left with conversation, photos and a Facebook nod! Highly recommend Kit Kat Italian Bar & Grill!"}
{"text":"This is old school Italian Style Dining. The owner always has his dog sit under the table. Great Friendly Service. Had the Rib Eye with Veg. It was done perfectly. The salad was also done great.  My other friends had the Grilled (Not Deep Fried,Breaded) Calamari.Good selection of wines, and beers. They also had the Veal Chop, it was a massive 12 - 14 oz Bone In.   Being a little pricey, but none the less, this was a great vibe and dining experience that I have had numerous times here."}
{"text":"Took a friend from out of town and it was awesome. The atmosphere, the friendly barmaid and the greeting from the owner made me proud to show off Toronto with this restaurant. Food was great and they accommodated dietary restrictions well. Will be back."}
{"text":"The first time I went into Kit Kat, I didn't know how they could stay in business.  It's got a small patio out front and seemed to have only a handful of tables in front.  I was unaware that there's a much larger dining area past the kitchen at the rear.  So they can make money.  And they do.  The food is dandy.  An Italian eatery, they definitely cater to the theatre crowd, running dinner specials that align with the performances found across the street.  Very rustic décor tending towards the eclectic, the setting gives a sense of an Italian bistro even before the menu is opened.  All of the faves are there.  Great antipasti, a good selection of pasta dishes, and meat dishes that will not disappoint.  The wine list is, well, huge, but not to the point of suffocating.  Suffice to say you won't go thirsty.  The staff are efficient and some of the best that you'll find.  Ask for Sean when you get there.  Tell him, that I sent you.  He may give you fantastic service, or spit on you and ask you to leave.  Not sure how it'll play out, really."}
{"text":"Food was okay, but the man at the front of the house wouldn't let my friends into the restaurant until the outer door was completely closed - which is understandable, but his condescending attitude was completely not understandable. He treated us as if we couldn't understand english, and wouldn't seat us until we took off our jackets! We were not given water, bread, or a drinks list until we asked for it, and it took almost 30 minutes to get our order placed, and another 30 to get our food. Overall, the food is okay but not worth it given the state of the service. Perhaps they will be nicer to you, who knows."}
{"text":"Recomendado.... Me hice pana del dueño y me dejo fumar en la terraza, la comida muy buena.... atención especial en King Street la mejor zona de Toronto."}
{"text":"Used to love going here years ago and so took a friend before our show at the Princess Wales. I am never going back to this restaurant. They now pack you in worse than a can of sardines. Don't get me wrong, it was always packed but now it's just terribly packed. My friend and we're seated between two other couples in a space that would usually sit 6, but usually it's a party of 6 that know each other and wouldn't trading spit or overhearing each other's stories! The food is not worth the $$$ and that kind of crowding. Decades ago, it was the go to place for food Italian cuisine. It no longer is."}
{"text":"As far as theater district restaurants go, this is one of the better ones. It's a charming setting with an interesting glass roof, aided by a charming staff, and the food is pretty good, although I suspect not as authentic as one might find in Little Italy.  The triple-pasta main is a great deal, whereupon you can opt to have three smaller pasta dishes as your main course, and there are a number of appetizing daily specials."}
{"text":"What a w'derful place!  Called for reservation and earliest time was 7:30!   OMGosh I had no desire to go then and decided to call again and accept that time. WOW, am I glad I did.  Husband had veal piccata and I had boccatini w/meat sauce. One of the best meat sauces I had and the veal was outstanding! John, one of the owners I was told, seated us immediately and continued to check on us as did our server.  Wine list was really nice. We picked a fabulous Chianti, how could you go wrong??! We will return!!  Just visiting from Florida but we're here long enough to return!  John even too our picture when we were leaving. Fun experience!"}
{"text":"We stumbled in here right before closing. They were very welcoming. We ordered the spinach and potato soup, warm goat cheese salad, garlic bread, and the bologonse bucatini. Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation weeks in advance. Anniversary for the Duchess and I. Even got an email reply saying we will make sure you have a wonderful evening. Arrived on time. No table. Couldn't tell us how long the wait would be. Tried to sit us right beside front desk where people enter to check in. There was no room there for sitting and people standing beside the table also waiting.  Explained I know the owner Al Carbone but front of house lady said we are busy. What do you want me to do? Asked for Al but she said he is in Florida. She honestly didn't care about us. I have eaten here before a few times and really enjoyed it That's why I made the reservation.   Never again. Ever.  p.s. Ended up down the street at another restaurant. Had a great evening anyway, no thanks to the Kit Kat."}
{"text":"Kit Kat is consistently great food and friendly. Lots of gluten free options including amazing pasta and veal chops second to none. It's a small place with a very family atmosphere.   The wait staff have been here forever and are very welcoming. Not practical for large groups but definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"I have been here in the past and once again came to celebrate a birthday dinner for two. The experience was great except for the wait the time even after making a reservation.  Staff: Was greeted my wait staff and instructed to wait by the bar (about 5 steps away). Told me they'd have my table ready soon. Unfortunately, it ended up being about another 15 to 20 minutes before we were actually seated. Lucky for me the Jays game was on so it kept me distracted for a bit. The bartender was friendly and greeted us as well as we waited. The wait staff kept our glasses filled and carried out friendly conversations with us.  Ambience: The place is cramped. When we were instructed to wait by the bar, we felt like we were obstructing guests and staff alike. But once people were starting to get seated we felt less obstructive. Luckily when we were seated, it was a dinner for two so we did not need too much space and we had a nice window seat. Unfortunately, the double doors don't close on its own, and guests frequently leave them open, which leaves a draft. The friendly staff close it every time they notice but it gets repetitive. While there may be some historical significance I am unaware of with those doors, I say just get rid of them. There are also a lot of pictures and knick knacks everywhere, which can be of interest to some, but at the same time it makes the place feel even more cramped than it already is. I have eaten in the back room and there is a lot more room but it is still a small space. Because it is so cramped, it attributes to the loud noise levels and often at times I could even hear conversations 3 tables over.  Food: We come back for the food, especially the Pasta Misto for two (for those who don't know, it is like a pasta sampler). This time we had the Seafood Pasta, plus Fettuccine Zarina and the Angelhair Basilico with Chicken. All three were amazing and I love the fact that any pasta specials can also be ordered in the Pasta Misto. My favourite is always the Fettuccine Zarina, because the rosé sauce is amazing and the salmon just melts in your mouth.  Overall I find myself coming back and enjoying the pasta every time. The staff is great but the ambience especially the front half of the restaurant is really cramped."}
{"text":"Meh. Mediocre restaurant run by a publicity hungry owner. For a guy who loves complaining about how every new regulation is going to put him under he's as tenacious as a cockroach."}
{"text":"I'd like to agree with Bert K. from earlier this year. This gem was recommended by the hotel concierge and Kit Kat didn't disappoint - but neither did it overwhelm.   The atmosphere was excellent as we were seated next to 'table 1' which would pass muster as the chef's table in most any other venue. The kitchen was lively and the vibe was right.  Italian cuisine was on point and delicious. Prices were reasonable as well. I'm certainly glad we tried and and wish them the best of luck in the future. Kim and Annette are particularly excellent servers."}
{"text":"This is a very homey, small but eclectic restaurant with lots of old celebrity pics, cute figurines and family like staff.    Overall the food is good but I would not say it is out of this world. They have daily specials selection which I tried the farfalle and smoked duck.  It was pretty good, decent portion size, filling and good price at $12 - $19 depending on what you choose.  Where I decided to go give 3 instead of 4 stars was that they had a terrible table for my group when reservation was made 1 month in advance - we sat right beside the front door and on a cold windy winter day, we felt the chill during out whole lunch.  Food was also inconsistent.  A bit coincidental that there was exactly 4 selections made across the group and exactly 2 orders of each was made - the same dish for each person who ordered it got a slightly different looking plate.  I would try this place again in the future but not with a group though."}
{"text":"Kit Kat consistently offers amazing food and great service.   Just went for a late night dinner, we didn't had to wait for a table. We were served by two waiters, and both were extremely attentive, pleasant and knew the menu inside out. You can tell they are professional waiters.   As for the food, we had mussels in a zesty sauce for appetizer. It was big enough for two and well executed.   For mains, I had the daily pasta special that consisted of chopped pork, broccoli, cherry tomatoes in a creamy sauce.   My partner had the Osso bucco, which was equally delicious. Portions are always very very good and the pasta is al dente.   I would give them 5 stars if only two things; Their daily special never change, I know it by heart already. And the bread could be a little fresher. But other than that, great place to go!"}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in the door, our dining experience was fantastic. I wanted someplace special since it was my wife's birthday.  This is a small,cozy restaurant in the entertainment district but the owner carefully watches the details every night. Despite the crowd, we were seated quickly and the wait staff showed up immediately. We already had started on a wonderful Pinot Noir so warm bread was served. I ordered the Osso Buco and my wife had a pasta with vegetable dish. Prior to my entree, I had some wonderful mussels in a red curry sauce. I couldn't resist dipping some bread in the sauce when I was finished with the mussels. The main courses were wonderful and very flavorable, obviously cooked fresh. I disagree with some of the reviews of this restaurant. Some complained about non-Italian dishes like meats.   Come on, if you are in an Italian restaurant, eat Italian! Besides the great food and service, the meal was topped off with a complimentary Tierra misu with a birthday candle for my wife. Next time we are in town, I'll definitely eat at the Kit Kat again."}
{"text":"So we've been here twice.  Are you ready for this?  It's been just over 10 years since our first visit.  The first time we were here was our first anniversary and we were venturing into the big city for a weekend away.  Oh how things change.  I digress.  I remember I loved what I had the first time, but I have no recollection of what I ate.  Go figure.    This time, however, armed with my handy iPhone app and a burning desire to review a restaurant, I kept track.  I had the Rigatoni Bolognese and my wife had the Angel Hair pasta. They were both excellent.  Now, I will have to be honest.  The Rigatoni Bolognese at Ferro on St. Clair is the best I've had so far and pretty much as good as we had in Italy (There, I said it!), but this was still very good.  The prices are quite reasonable (a decade ago, we didn't think so, but living in the city changes you). If you're on King St West, perhaps after a nice expensive visit to MEC, you should pop by and grab some pasta.  After all, can you really hate a restaurant with a tree growing inside it?"}
{"text":"Had a nice experience over all, good service and ambiance, ok food, however needs an adjustment to go with times ! And for sure needs renovation"}
{"text":"This place is very cool.  It seems to have been built by joining several houses that were back to back and covering up the garden space in between but leaving the old tree growing through the roof.  Service is somewhat strange in a kind of surly your not in the mafia so get the f'out kind of way, or so it seems at first, aftera while it warms up.  There was nothing on the menu I felt like and I told the barmaid so.  She asked me to tell her what I wanted and they would go and make it.  I ended up having a huge bowl of spaghetti alio olio peperencino with spicy Italian sausage.  It was marvelous.    Both the crowd and the money here are older, it's a nice atmospere, try it!"}
{"text":"This place has steadily gone downhill through the years. Enjoyed it when it first opened, but the food has become cliché and boring. And the atmosphere is right out of the 1980s. Chequered table clothes ain't a thing any more, sorry guys."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place to hang out and have conversations. What a rustic and mashup of miscellaneous things. Their prices are very affordable compared to other place on King West. However their food is a little over average as I was not blown away by the corn and crab soup."}
{"text":"Ambiance is great, really a nice place to hang out. It's busy here being where it's located on King street; be prepared to wait for a table on a weekend night. You're looking at a good $50 for a decent bottle of wine. The food is delicious, however it appeared that \"adding chicken\" to a pasta dish seemed to be processed chicken, which was a bit disappointing. It might have been how it was prepared. This being said, the pasta itself is fresh and appetizers like bruschetta are delicious, and overall quite enjoyable. The service is very friendly and quick, and in general it is worth a visit."}
{"text":"Groovy little Italian inspired restaurant.  The walls are decorated with wall of fame photos, farm animal figurines, and inscriptions from past clientele - very cool.  We enjoyed a calamari appetizer, whole squid, grilled on greens & lightly spiced sauce. Entrées seafood pasta with a Mediterranean infused sauce and a bow tie pasta with pork loin and tomato based sauce - both extremely enjoyable.  Fresh bread throughout the meal.  Good wine list and I personally recommend their Kit Kat Coffee (Expresso, Grand Mariner, & Kahlua topped with whipped cream & a sugared rim).  I especially enjoyed the causal conversation with the staff."}
{"text":"My go to place whenever I am in Toronto  The food , the service , the people it just doesn't get any better . I have drifted a few times to try a new ITALIAN place but keep coming back. You feel at home here Thank you all at Kit Kat"}
{"text":"After wandering around the city for about two hours, my friend and I were trying to decide on a restaurant for dinner. We decided on a place but they didn't have any tables available and I wasn't interested in waiting. We had walked by Kit Kat and decided to head the two doors over and have dinner there.  We were promptly welcome and seated right next to the bar and our coats were taken and hung up near the end of the bar. The menu here isn't huge but there are a lot of good, classic Italian choices. We decided to start with some garlic bread and I went for the veal picatta on the server's recommendation. My friend go the sausage pasta, which we were told is the best selling dish at the restaurant.  The garlic bread was good - simple, classic bread with cheese and lots of garlic. Our food came out quickly and MAN was it ever good. Veal picatta can be tricky - its very easy to overcook veal but this was done to perfection. Melted in my mouth. There were some delicious grilled veggies on my plate and potatoes underneath the veal as well. I could have licked the plate clean.  My friend's sausage pasta was great, the sheer amount of sausage that was in his dish was mindboggling. We were told that the owner's brother makes the sausage and you could tell. Fantastic sausage and nice spicy sauce to go on top.  We opted for dessert and I just HAD to have the tirimisu. Blown away. A lovely dessert, fresh lady fingers soaked in some kind of liqueur, whipped cream, chocolate... again, could have licked the plate clean.  The service here was very friendly, I felt like it was the kind of place where they'd remember you if you came back again. I wouldn't hesitate to come back to this restaurant and try some other dishes. Absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Had the Osso Bucco as per the waiter's recommendation, however, it wasn't good at all, not even the fettuccini that comes with it. Prices are too high for the quality of food they offer. Service was not good either. Won't come back."}
{"text":"I love it !!! We were referred by the receptionist at a hotel. We had very limited choices but was soooo glad to have picked this place. The place is a bit small making it cramped with so many people but I didn't mind. The food was very delicious. The service - accommodating. Definitely returning for seconds and hopefully third"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night.. with reservations.. it was packed, loud, boisterous, and everyone was crammed in.. but it was fun with friendly service and everyone enjoyed themselves. Better for casual or family dining, rather than an intimate date! I had the scallops and they were perfectly cooked and delicious. My friend had the steak and it was tasty but a bit tough. Other friends had pasta dishes and were very happy with them as well. The waitress was wonderful, we'll go back again!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a reliable, tasty and satisfying Italian meal, look no further than this cozy King Street eatery.   The food tastes like your favourite home cooked meal that your parents only made on special occasions. The service is warm and friendly. And the atmosphere is laid back and inviting. Plus, their garlic bread is next level."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Kit Kat! Delicious pasta. Quite expensive, but would be a great place for a nice date!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend found Kit Kat online doing a search of good places to eat in Toronto, and I'm so glad we decided to stop in for lunch.  The place is small, but very homey. The kitchen is open and you can see the fresh bread and pasta they use for their food. We were seated in the back of the restaurant, but the table was very intimate and we had a great view of the rest of the restaurant.  We ordered the calamari special, and it was spiced and seasoned to perfection served with a cream sauce and a small arugula salad.   I ordered the Angelhair Basilico with chicken and it was better than I expected. The sauce to noodle ratio was perfect; my pasta wasn't drowning in sauce nor was the sauce just drizzled on the noodles, it was mixed in with onions and basil to add flavor. The chicken was diced and also mixed in and was not dry at all. The plum tomato sauce was also a surprise to me. Usually I find Italian restaurants to have a strong tomato flavor in their sauce, but Kit Kat had a very balanced sauce. I also must complement them on portioning just enough chicken to the noodles. I didn't have a surplus of noodles left over after finishing my chicken or too much chicken and not enough noodles. The portion was great for its' price of 15.95 I might add.  The salmon fettuccine was the same way as the angelhair basilico. A good balance of sauce and noodles as well as a good balance of salmon and noodles. I thought the sauce was very creamy, but I don't really have a taste for creamy sauces so if you do, would recommend the Alfredo.  Our service was also superb. There was just two workers since it was a bit later in the afternoon, but our waiter was very attentive to all of his tables and brought us all we wanted right away.  All in all, I would definitely recommend Kit Kat to get for a stop-in lunch to get good Italian food!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! We travelled the whole day to Toronto, tired and didn't want to eat too heavy but we ended up eating every bite of the food we ordered: appetizer Grilled Calamari, entries Angel Hair pasta and 4 Cheese Fettuccini. The grilled calamari included 2 whole pieces of squid, perfectly cooked tender and smokey. Angel hair was super thin, which I never had anywhere else before, with delicious red sauce. Fettuccini was tossed with just the right amount of sauce, unbelievably not too rich as most Fettuccini Alfredo does, tasted great. Even though the pasta dishes were not freshly made, they were the best cooked dry pasta. Highly recommend you give this place a try if you are in the area. However be prepared that the place does not look fancy or neat but in fact a little bit crowded and chaos. Eating environment is a little bit unappetizing but once you taste their food, you may be able to just lock your eyes and stomach on the food, forgetting all about the surroundings."}
{"text":"We highly recommend this place, for both the food and the atmosphere.  What a fun night, the place was packed but managed so well, the host seemed to know where everybody was. In moments we were sitting at a beautiful table right next to the kitchen. Which is open style in the center of the restaurant.. As a cook myself I thoroughly enjoyed watching these professional chefs make our meals. They worked wonderfully as a team and seemed to know each other's thoughts as they prepare the food   The wait staff work as a choreographed team in the tight spaces but managed to pull everything off with a smile and made you feel truly like you were at your moms house.   Did I mention that I highly recommend this place. The last time we were here was 20 or so years ago when phantom was running. It's great to see the place not just still in existence, but Flourishing."}
{"text":"Within walking distance from my hotel. Very easy to order take out. Great food. Large orders for a reasonable price. 1 plate of fettuccine Alfredo fed my husband and I for dinner. Very happy and I will come here again while visiting Toronto."}
{"text":"We showed up At 20:00 with 2 minors & 5 adults they accommodated us immediately. Our meals were on point!!"}
{"text":"Couldn't of asked for a better local place.  Food was amazing and staff was great.  Owners even stopped to say hi.  Place was packed for a Tuesday night.   Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"We used to frequently dine at the Kit Kat before a Mirvish show. It doesn't serve the greatest Italian food but we always enjoyed the vibe. Then we watched with dismay as the owner made a fool of himself protesting the King Street pilot project. He even displayed a crude middle finger sculpture outside the restaurant which takes the cake for juvenile antics. My family and friends have decided not to grace his establishment again. If people do choose to dine there, your best bet is the fettucine Zarina, which is a little tastier than their average dish, most of which are quite bland."}
{"text":"I found a cockroach in my food - alive!  We were sitting in the back near the door onto the alley.  It may have come in that way but I will never go back there again.  Up to that point the food was okay.  They have to fix this issue."}
{"text":"Pros:  - We had made a reservation at 7:30pm, but we showed up early & they got us right in an hour ish in advance. - Super homey / hole in the wall, but classy vibe. - Food was delicious & came out quicker than expected! - We split the fettuccine alberto & garlic bread. Amazing!  Con(s);  - We were sat at the kind of awkward lone table in the walkway of all of the hustle & bustle. People had to pass us + were almost borderline hovering over our table as they came in & left the restaurant, and even during their wait to be seated. Not the staffs fault, but we felt maybe the owners were just trying to maximize sales, which I get. We are super laid back folk, but were a bit uncomfortable and felt we couldn't fully enjoy your dinner experience, due to this table placement.  Would still totally recommend this restaurant to friends & all who visit Toronto. Just ask to not be seated at the lone table in the tiny walkway in front of their bar area! :)"}
{"text":"Great service and the vibe there is so cool. I recommend sitting in the back - there's a brick wall with tons of chalk writing on it, plus the large wooden booths are very nice. The whole look of the restaurant seemed like it was made for a movie set."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Toronto.  Great italian in a unique setting."}
{"text":"Nice. Cozy. Maybe a little too cozy (cramped) but flavorful and bright."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended by our hotel. It is a great place for food and atmosphere- I felt Luke was in Italy! Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Kit Kat is a tiny Italian restaurant in the entertainment district. I walk by this place many times and heard good things, so I decided to give it a try. The lunch menu is fairly small, but they have tons of specials. I ordered the seafood pasta special ($20), which tasted great. The shrimp were quite large, the pasta and sauce were tasty. Service was good. The waitress offered freshly ground pepper and parmesan. They also offer bread and butter to start."}
{"text":"The owners introduced themselves to me when I first entered which gave me the impression the restaurant was a friendly and engaging place. The environment was eclectic and energetic with wonderful jazz music playing in the background. They have a nice wine menu with a decent selection. Not Wine Spectator Wow, but decent. The bread was fresh good Italian bread, I'd give it an eight out of ten. I had the Ceasar Salad which was terrific, the romaine wS fresh and crisp and the dressing tasted homemade. For my main course I had Linguine with a Saffron cream sauce with zucchini carrots and peas. It also had seafood in it. The linguine tasted fresh, and was perfectly cooked. The sauce was amazing. Unfortunately the seafood was a bit skimpy, just two scallops and three shrimp. It was supposed to have clams as well but I didn't find any in my dish. I finished up with a cappuccino which was excellent! Overall I give Kit Kat four out of five stars, it's a fun place to dine and the food is good! I do think there's room to grow but you'll do well dining here"}
{"text":"This place isn't worth your money at all - the pastas are oversauced, service is terrible and they pack people in like sardines.   We waited almost an hour for a table when they told us the wait would be about 20 minutes. Our table, when we were finally seated was right in the hallway between the kitchen and rest of the dining room. We had to flag someone down to order, and no one told us about the specials. Once the food came, the pasta was swimming in a pool of \"rose\" that was thin and oddly gravelly.     Honestly, there are so many much better Italian restaurants in the same area, do yourself a favour and spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Hey  So I decided to go on a whim and trust the reviews for this place on Yelp and I was excited to try it out. I made the mistake of not making reservations for many of the better (Keyword) and newer restaurants in Toronto. We wanted to stay downtown and this is was one of the only places that we could get a reservation a few hours notice. A+ for that.  When we arrived at Kit Kat, we were slightly confused on where to stand to ask someone about our reservation. What seemed to be the owner, came up and asked us if we had a reservation, I replied with yes and was then told to go to the bar, which I had thought that we were already standing at. 10-15 minutes later, we had a seat in the back where it was slightly close quarters as most places can be in Toronto.   We ordered some house red and white wine which was nice and refreshing on a warmer day. The anti-pasto for two and was a huge disappointment. in how little meat/cheese we received and how much veggies came with it. It almost felt like something you would buy at Metro or Sobey's. Next came our main. We both ordered the special which was a seafood pasta which was nice, a lot of fish (clam, shrimp).   Our waitress was pretty funny/expressionless which added some comedic value to the meal. For the price, it reminds me of an upscale east side mario's and I can't say I would go back."}
{"text":"I've come here several times because of its proximity to the theater district and feel rather dispassionate about it.    I like the restaurant itself, it is long with booths along the side and small tables that make conversation easy.  It is warmly lit and appointed so it feels inviting.  Its the food itself I can't get fully behind.  I've tried many of the pasta dishes and never been very excited about any of them.  The Fettuccine Alberto is likely my favourite but it doesn't stand out in anyway that is particularly remarkable. For the price, there are a plethora other Italian options in the city that are superior"}
{"text":"The service isn't very good over here. From the very beginning it felt like we were being rushed into everything (ordering, leave)  The angelhair pasta was pretty good although a bit overpriced"}
{"text":"KitKat staff were accomodating and friendly. We had a table of 8, and everyone in our party was very happy with their food and drink selections. Waitstaff is good, and we enjoyed seeing what we think was the owner/manager's young son (about 13 yrs old), working that night. The young man was personable, helpful and hardworking. The restaurant is small, but we enjoyed that aspect, as well as the great location. We also really enjoyed the creme brulee dessert and cafe au lait after dinner. Wonderful waitress, who had some great suggestions about the menu. We look forward to our next visit when in Toronto!"}
{"text":"This was a great choice for Italian food. We went here on a weeknight and was told that we had to wait about 45 minutes for a table. We went to a nearby bar to get a drink while we waited. The front of the restaurant had a bar but to stand at it to get a drink, you would have been in everyone's way as they walked by.   The waiters and waitresses were very courteous. It was a great atmosphere. The food was awesome. The pasta was fresh and the sauce was so flavorful.   My only complaint about this place was that the bathrooms were pretty gross. You have to walk down some little stairs to get to a basement. There were two small bathrooms that smelled kinda funky... like moldy. They just didn't match up with the upstairs."}
{"text":"I ate at this place when I first moved to Toronto, it was about 100m from my condo building. The food was super bland. The martini's (happy hour special) were strong, but just bar-rail gin. Despite living in the neighbourhood only 100m away for several more years, and eating out several times a week, I never returned. There are simply dozens of better options in the neighbourhood, even if you are craving italian.  Don't waste your time here. If you're a tourist, please don't consider this representative of Toronto food. There's so many better options nearby."}
{"text":"Another Italian place !! This place has a great location, and its super nice from the outside,also very cozy inside !! The food was nothing that excited me !! Its food i could simply do at home or even better, i was not so impressed with the food i would say the menu needs some work , there are better places out there for sure. Its a good place to come once try it out, and after just move on !!"}
{"text":"The food was good and service was good too but it was a little overpriced. I got the Penne Spicy Italian Sausage and my son got the Fettuccine Alberto. We also ordered garlic bread not knowing we'd be getting bread with our meal. We both just had water. Our total was $52 plus tip so I left $60. It wasn't super filling. We sat in an awkward table, we were in a weird spot. I won't go back while in town but I didn't dislike the place just didn't feel like I got the bang for my buck."}
