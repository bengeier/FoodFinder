{"text":"I have been here numerous times .If I was reviewing the food it would be 5 stars. The waitress' are bloody miserable and act like your a bother. Unfortunately, it's happened too many times and I won't go back."}
{"text":"Being from Saskatchewan, I was appalled at the service we received. After waiting 5 minutes, someone finally came and took our drink order. We received that relatively quick, but after having a menu closed in front of us for over 20 minutes, we paid for our two drinks and left. I will add, while we were waiting for someone to take our food order, two servers helped the two tables beside us, and cleaned a third. Completely ignoring us.   When they finally came to take our order, they seemed shocked when we said we changed or mind and wanted the bill in stead.   We will never return, and have told friends that live in Calgary of this adventure as well."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place for a drink before dinner at another nearby establishment. A few in our group had driven past it and had been curious to see what it was like.  It is small, cozy and has an old rec room kind of feeling. It seemed popular with many of the tables being taken. I noticed over the 45 minutes or so we were there a few tables turned over which is a good sign. It really has a feel of a place you \"stop in\" for a quick drink or two then go elsewhere.  I did see one couple eating though-perhaps next time we'll come back and try the food.  The service was decent and  the place had interesting Saskatchewan decor (if you are into that :) ). Not a destination bar that is for sure but worth a pop in if you are in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"The best way to describe this place is that it's nearly always full of happy customers.  The food is great, the service is memorable, and the atmosphere is perfect for a neighborhood bar. It's definitely a sports bar when it needs to be (during a good game) but it's also a perfect neighborhood bar the rest of the time."}
{"text":"Excellent perogies fried onions, sour cream, cabbage rolls and Pilsner, you need to love this food to enjoy it. Love you mom, God rest your soul, for raising me on this food."}
{"text":"The positives here is the food. Particularly the hand pinched perogies and wings. Perogies are pillowy, topped with perfectly saut√©ed onions and cold sour cream. The wings were crunchy, meaty and not bruised or discoloured. My in laws enjoyed their steak, sandwiches and cabbage rolls. Food is inexpensive. Not too much selection for beers."}
{"text":"Ended up finding this place by fluke after hearing the wait for a table at a place I was going to go to in the neighborhood had a 30 min wait. Glad I found it! Wasn't much to look at but everything was clean and tidy. Not too busy but the server was amazing! Had a couple of drinks, pirogies/kielbasa meals. Music not too loud, could hear my date.  Some sports teams were in after their games, friendly place. Felt bad for the waitress for having to put up with two drunk losers-honestly the place could've used some sort of security present so she didn't have to deal with them. (Wasn't aware until they left how bad they were)"}
{"text":"I'm from Saskatchewan and the owners of Pazzer's did a good job (with or without intention) at making the pub feel like it has been transplanted from a small town there.  It too is very small and decorated with a mish-mash of items, some of which honor Saskatchewan culture, and look like they belong in someone's basement rec room as noted in the previous review.  It's unpretentious and you could get away with wearing jogging pants on a Saturday night.    I'd go back for afternoon or early evening drinks and food.  I only had a Corona during my first visit yesterday.  This is a suitable pub if you're looking for a low key place to hang out with your friends and have some laughs."}
