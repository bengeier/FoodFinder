{"text":"The evening our family visited Dixie Pig in Tega Cay it was extremely hot.  I don't know if the AC was broken but I do not appreciate eating indoors and sweating while trying to enjoy my meal.  I had the French Dip and it was not as good as the Dixie Pig in Rock Hill.  The meat was tougher, I will visit in Rock Hill but not Tega Cay again."}
{"text":"Came for lunch today with 2 co-workers.  This was my 5th visit.  The pulled pork sandwich was fantastic.  Mac and cheese was really good as well!!!  The bud light draft was cold and served promptly.  I will always come back to this place for lunch or happy hour.  The black hair female bartender was SLAMMED!!!  But...she kept her cool and did a fantastic job.  She did not let the pressure get to her.  Thanks for another great visit Dixie Pig."}
{"text":"Fantastic BBQ, with terrible service with a smile.
Stopped in with my wife and two kids and enjoyed everything about the place. Just wish the waitress wasn't so busy. Order a half rack of ribs and asked for a side of sauce, it didn't arrive until I received the bill. My wife asked for a D. Pepsi and it never came. The waitress forgot the kids drinks too until we asked twice. It may be a good idea if she wasn't responsible for tables inside and outside... she made it seems like we weren't as important as her customers sitting inside."}
{"text":"Excellent.  I have dined here for both lunch and dinner many times.  Every time the food and the service was superb.  Drinks are reasonably priced and solid.  Ginger the bartender is very polite and does a great job.  The ribs are very good and the Paulie sandwich will fill you up.  This is a great place."}
{"text":"The food is wonderful. The staff is very nice and observant. Be sure to try the Mac n Cheese."}
{"text":"Awesome... just like Rock Hill. My staple meal is the French Dip and it was amazing as always. This location is set back behind the salon with lots of parking which is nice. It's new and big, it can fit the crowd which is really great. They absolutely needed this location, it came at the perfect time! The bar space is great, I can't wait to spend a few happy hours there. I'm happy to see that there have a nice outdoors area that's enclosed plus an open outdoor area. This spot is perfectly placed. 

I must say it was nice to see some familiar faces from Rock Hill, the owner/chef was there as well as our very first waiter we had from Rock Hill. I'm sure they were helping run everything as smooth as possible. We will definitely be back here to try the new additions to the menu. I posted some pics of the menu so everyone can see!"}
{"text":"I was conflicted about how many stars to give *this location*. I LOVE Dixie Pig barbecue. Both the Rock Hill location and this one have my favorite barbecue anywhere. BUT: This location is so... SO... loud. I went once shortly after it opened and although there were very few people in the restaurant, I could barely have a conversation with my fiance. They had music turned up SUPER loud and the acoustics combined with the obnoxious music just made it a less than enjoyable experience. I was excited that this location has so much more space but I cannot sit in this restaurant. I will be going back... but half of the experience for me is going *out*, sitting in a restaurant to get out of the house. So I will be getting takeout. I want to see if they make any attempts to keep the music down low consistently and get some panels or something to bring that awful noise level down. I will update this review if they do."}
{"text":"I was skeptical at first, having read some of the reviews, only to find out the food and the service were excellent! Our server Erin was prompt and pleasant, and the food itself was delicious. We started out with the pork belly appetizer and went on to the St. Louis style barbecue ribs and bratwurst dinner, both of which were fantastic! The smoked BBQ flavor came through and was moist and flavorful...As so many BBQ joints are not, where the meat is dry and chewy. We loved it! Which is a most needed eatery in Tega Cay. Welcome"}
{"text":"Best BBQ we've had in the local area for sure!
Brisket sandwich was very good (and I'm from Texas, so I'm a brisket snob for sure) and the ribs were perfect. Great flavor, very tender, crisp but still moist and they were just shy of \"fall off the bone\" so you could actually take a bite of them. 
The collards with black-eyed peas were OUTSTANDING!
Baked beans-very good, too. 
My wife and I shared the banana pudding, again, OUTSTANDING!  
Sorry we didn't take pics.  
Service was prompt and very friendly. 
Honestly, my only complaint is that they only serve brisket once a week, otherwise they'd be very close to 5-Stars. 
We will be back often!"}
{"text":"Awesome hole in the wall restaurant. Authentic bbq!! Great selection of house made sauce. Food is cooked daily. Family friendly, laid back atmosphere.

Black eyed peas + collards are amazing! Also the Mac n cheese is great. The bbq chicken sandwich was great too! Decent sized portions. A good place to pick up dinner to take home."}
{"text":"They are working really hard. Food is good and creative so not just a plain BBQ joint. Still need a little refinement in service but the staff and Manager are attentive and will make it good for you. Will be back"}
{"text":"Everything made in-house. The pulled chicken salad was great. Their homemade onion dressing was the bomb. The Memphis Sauce was fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"We come here often!  Food is always excellent but tonight the ribs were totally beyond delish!  My hubs was very happy to get his Father's Day fix!  Kudos to the Pig for the awesome bbq!  And a shout out to the bartender Dex, who always give us great service and makes us feel like family!"}
{"text":"Looking for some good BBQ  or other awesome yumminess! Go to The Dixie Pig  in Rock Hill or Tega Cay! The one is RH is small, but the food is amazing. Tega Cay location is large with a full size bar. Help local business thrive!! After ordering many times from RH, went to TC location last night and the servers are great and the manager came out of the kitchen to check on every table! Service with a smile! The 1/4 chicken white with Alabama White sauce and the BBQ hash are amazing! I've never had anything that was fabulous! Mac and Cheese is just like from grandma's kitchen."}
{"text":"This review is based on two visits.  We first visited just a few days after opening and the experience was great.  Service was fast and attentive and the food came out quick and was worth coming back for.  I did note that they seemed overstaffed at the time and all the owners were  present and greeting guests. 5 star experience in this day.

Unfortunately our second visit could not have gone worse.  We waited at the host stand for nearly 5 mins while the hostess stayed on the phone taking to/go orders.  No other staff walking by took the initiative to greet us so we just had to wait.  When we were sat, our waitress again took over 5 mins to come to the table.  Drink order was placed and they arrived after a short wait, we put in our food order at 615pm.   I was telling my wife and our hungry 6yr old 'don't worry bbq places serve fast because most of it is already made and just needs to be plated up.' After 20 mins of waiting I was starting to get worried,  that's when I noticed other tables in the place didn't have food either.  I stated watching the kitchen door to see if anything was coming out- no food,  just some flustered looking waitresses.   By 640 we were ready to give up.  It took until 645 to find out waitress and officially throw in the towel.   No visit or acknowledgement by management, an apology was offered by the waitress on our way out the door. I felt sorry for the hungry masses that were just entering the place- good luck. This little piggy went home. 0 Star experience this day

Seems the luster has worn off and the owners have gone back to rock hill.  This is too big of a restaurant space to be successful without solid systems and procedures in place. It's hard to run such a big dining room and bar,  and they haven't even used the patio yet.  This is why other private concepts have not done well here.  Without help this place has little chance.  I am hoping they get it figured out before it succumbs to the fate of the previous."}
{"text":"Finally a GREAT restaurant in Tega Cay.
Everything I've tried is great.... but the French dip is out of this world.
Friendly and helpful staff.
This is my go to place..."}
{"text":"Driving in, the sign is a few yards closer to HWY 160 than the driveway to pull in. You might put your blinker on a bit too soon but, never hurts to warn people!
I met 3 friends around 7p on a Tuesday night. It was packed outside on the deck, which want surprising considering the beautiful 70 degree night. The whole place was seat yourself and I counted 6 waiter/waitresses. I'd say it was staffed just right for the evening. We chose to sit at the bar area tables (high tops) and quite enjoyed Dax, our bartender/server. He was a nice, shoot it straight kind of guy. 
We all ordered beverages and started out by sharing the french onion dip. The pita chips were fresh, flavorful, warm and served with a killer dip. The onion flavor wasn't too overpowering (Didn't linger all night) and the tang from the cream cheese seemed to pair perfectly. 
Three of the four of us ordered the BBQ Plate with two sides. Two of us had the fries and mac n cheese, one had fries and baked beans. Two enjoyed the Memphis Magic sauce and the other devoured his Carolina Gold. The fourth in our party had the 1/2 chicken with potato salad and baked beans. He ordered the Alabama White sauce and practically licked the plate clean of it. Everything came out hot, delicious and perfectly seasoned. The meat was moist and tender, sides were fresh; really great spot! 
All four entrees were proportioned perfectly and priced as expected for quality and quantity. Really can't complain!
Plenty of floor space for a group or just a casual date."}
{"text":"Had the pulled pork sandwich with Mac n cheese and fries. Awesome. Tried the mustard and house vinegar sauces, both delicious. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Great location, comfortable dining room and bar. Food is outstanding and service fantastic. Had reservations this past Saturday for 10 at 1pm, ended up having more than expected, 22 people to be exact and they accommodated us with no hesitation. Items I have tried so far are pork belly, hash, shrimp, bbq ribs and pulled pork. All fantastic including  sides. 
Nice bar area with tons of beer options and mixed drinks. Great family atmosphere in dining room. They also have an outdoor bar and patio with tons of seating during warm weather."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. It is our go to spot! We have been going to the one in Rock Hill for a few years so was super happy to see the one open in our neighborhood. Give them a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"So glad they are finally open. 
No surprise that the food is just as good as what made them as desired as they are. 
The server did an amazing job, the portions are spot on. 
Being one who doesn't like smoked chicken I can say they have some kind of awesomeness twist the do to theirs, I almost think maybe the smoke it then grill it or something, no matter what they do the chicken is amazing. 
The biggest drawback with this location, and this has been an issue with every restaurant in this same spot, the draft beer isn't cold enough, the make shift cooler is nothing more than a room with some window air conditioners, I don't know anyone who wants to spend $6-$8 on a great craft beer and have it come out just a bit cooler than room temp. 
This in itself won't stop me from going back but it will impact how often I do go back."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in the state! I'm from the NC mountains and know good BBQ. This place is an award winner for its sauces! BTW, their hush puppies, !"}
{"text":"I have been to the Dixie Pig on Celanese several times, but since it was Friday night us and our friends went to this new location.  When we pulled up we looked at each other and said wow they are packed, but seeing as how this location is much larger we decided to see if we could get a seat.  Thy had a table for 6 ready, but unfortunately it was inside where they had a band playing.  My daughter had a bad headache and we asked for an outside table, at first they they thought it would be a 30 min wait, but to our surprise they were able to get us a table in a couple of minutes.  Our waiter David was incredible and was awesome getting our orders quickly and our drinks.  I highly recommend the onion dip and the jalapeño pimento cheese (this comes with fried pork skins which were still sizzling when it came out) Wow.  We ordered the French dip sandwich, ribs, the Paulie, pulled pork, and the smoked chicken!  All the dishes were perfect and delicious!Considering how packed the place was I thought our food came out quickly and there was no rush for us to hurry.  I can't thank the management for getting us a table quickly or him checking to make sure we were ok.  Yes I saw you making sure we were in good hands and I can't thank you enough for your thoughtfulness!  I can't wait for more family and friends to visit so we can bring them here!  Great new place, great staff, you folks rock!"}
{"text":"Meh. 
Had high hopes for this place but after two visits with very inattentive wait staff, I don't see it lasting too long.

First time my daughter and I went for an after school snack. It took over 20 minutes for anyone to take our drink order.

Second time was this week for dinner and we waited nearly an hour for our food before giving up and leaving. 

Really hope they can work the kinks out because the food is really good. I think the large space and many tables may be their PITfall"}
{"text":"Nice crowd for a Sunday night .  Service was great, fast and friendly.  Beef ribs were fantastic ... huge portion and delicious.  Fall off the bone tender and a savory hint of sweet barbecue sauce that was awesome in its own right but subtle enough to let the flavor of the meat shine through... and man did it ever!!"}
{"text":"Everything was fantastic! I highly recommend the shrimp app. The wings were spectacular as well. Needless to say BBQ was off the hook. The staff was beyond awesome and loved the patio. All around excellent! Great experience!"}
{"text":"I am excited to see a new option in TegaCay. We have tried this place twice
So here is the good. The food is outstanding and the waitstaff is very friendly. We have had the bbq,pork belly and catfish. The bbq is very flavorful and hit the spot.
Both times we were quick to get our drinks and place our order. On both visits it took over 46 mins to receive our food from time of order and several other tables endured the long wait also.
I will give the benefit of doubt that it's a new establishment and they are working on the kitchen efficiencies"}
{"text":"Dixie Pig is legit. I heard great things about the Rock Hill location and was super excited they were coming to Tega Cay. Despite the typical grand opening pains (e.g. service, food delays etc) the Dixie Pig is top on my list for great barbecue and I've tried the \"best of\" St. Louis, Kansans City and the Carolinas. Welcome Dixie Pig!"}
{"text":"Dixie Pig in Rock Hill is my go to place for ribs. Today I tried Tega Cay and was very disappointed. The sides were as expected but the ribs portion was small and tough. The beer was over priced. The restaurant was clean and nice."}
{"text":"The best barbeque around.  When you walk into the place you can tell they are going to have good barbeque just from looking in the dining room.  The food would not disappoint you"}
{"text":"Food:  Honestly the best BBQ i have had from local joints. Had the pulled pork plate, fries and white slaw. My friend had the same but mac & cheese so we could share/try it. The Memphis sauce was really good. They have eastern NC, mustard and white sauces. All were good. 

Service:  Dan was very helpful and attentive. We were served pretty quickly. But keep in mind everything is homemade so during busy times service may be a bit slower. But is not a fast food joint. We went early on a Tuesday. 

Overall i would recommend to my friends and we will go back"}
{"text":"Patience, my friends. The food is great. Whenever a new restaurant opens in Tega Cay, it seems everyone in town descends on it.  However, this usually causes a long wait for anything. 

I am really excited to have a Dixie Pig location closer to my home. The space is so much larger than Rock Hill and the outdoor area will be nice in warm weather. The food still is the same high quality as the other location. I love that they added some menu items to this location including seafood. I tried two of these items. We started with the jalapeno pimento cheese dip. It comes with pork skins for dipping. This was great. There was a nice kick to the dip, but not overly spicy. And for a bbq place, love the fact pork skins are the vessel for dip. For my main dish, I tried the shrimp salad sandwich. It was good, but not very big. By the time our food arrived I was starving and I wish I had ordered a dinner instead of a sandwich. I was hoping for more of a kick of spice in the shrimp salad but didn't find it. I liked the toasted bun it came on and the creaminess of the salad. I got my favorite side of black-eyed peas and collards. The Pig still does the best job at this dish. 

Now it was a Saturday and new business to the area, but we spent about two hours there. Our server was working his butt off and I was patient, but it was hard waiting. We also had to grab several servers walking by for refills. Our server and someone else both stopped by to let us know what was going on and apologized for the delay. Apparently the kitchen got backed up because a large to go order was wrong and the kitchen had to redo it. I understand this kind of thing happens, but I was hoping something quick to make like hushpuppies or fries would be brought to our table, which never happened. Thank goodness we had that appetizer. I still love the food, but hope Dixie Pig can cut down the food wait time. 

Be patient and give Dixie Pig a try. I'll be back and hope to update my review to reflect the experience I know they are capable of."}
{"text":"4 stars because it is NOISEY. Our server Ashlie was great and fun!  Love a sense of humor.  Had the brats which were really good with the special mustard sauce. Delicious! Met the owner Paul. My husband (not a big bbq fan) had grilled bologna and cheese. Says it was good but will try something else when we go back. Smoked chicken soundsdelicious.  Try it out."}
{"text":"Finally decided to try the newest bbq spot in Tega Cay and I was more than impressed. We went for lunch and enjoyed the outside patio seating. Service was decent, but the food more than made up for any wait in service. 
I will definitely be back! Great Job!"}
{"text":"I finally made it on a Wednesday for the Brisket.   I took a bite and thought, that's pretty good.  Then I took another bite.  And then another bite.  By the time I finished I was rendered speechless and I was as satisfied as any man can be by great barbecue."}
{"text":"We went there on a Thursday evening and it was pretty dead but the food was excellent. I had ribs with baked beans and collards, and pecan pie. All were outstanding. I highly recommend this place for anyone in the area who likes real barbecue. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Family friendly with a good selection of beer on tap. 
Kid's menu was good with the Mac and cheese but the meal size mac is the same as a side of Mac. 
The corn is deep fried and my children would not touch it. 
Overall the kids loved the pulled pork. 
We had the garlic Parmesan wings and they were tasty; but, the Pork ribs were our favorite."}
{"text":"Good food and good service.  This is a nice addition to Tega Cay and I like the proximity of it to my house.  Beer selection was also good which will make it a good place come the fall for football."}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time this evening. The food and service were both excellent. The grilled pork belly with Asian BBQ glaze was delicious. The BBQ prime rib sandwich was also very good. We'll definitely be back to visit soon!"}
{"text":"On the one hand, I wish the Dixie Pig was a bit closer, but on the other hand, I'm rather glad that they aren't because I'd be there a whole lot more frequently. 

This spot is a good size on the inside, and because of that it can be a bit loud due to the echo, but the staff does a great job of communicating despite that potential issue, the only thing to be aware of is that if you happen to hit it wrong, there could be a slight delay.

Not sure exactly what happened, as things were going swimmingly, and our apps came out just about immediately after we ordered them (including some freshly-popping pork rinds), but it took a really long time for the main dishes to be delivered. It's certainly possible that some larger parties slipped in while we were eating on our apps, but whatever it is, this was about the only downside.

The meal itself was tasty and there was plenty of food to go around."}
{"text":"I went here on a Wednesday night so it was the night they have beef brisket. I had the brisket, coleslaw and mac and cheese. The brisket was very good as was the mac and cheese. The coleslaw...not my type. It was mediocre at best. Also, they gave two free hush puppies that were very good even though they were not warm. Service was also very good. I would return."}
{"text":"Yum! I have been a fan of the pig since I moved here. Started at the location in rock hill. I bring all of my out of town company here and they love it! The Tega Cay Location seems to have a more extensive menu. You can never go wrong with the pulled pork. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Good food. Good service. I tried one of their local brews that I'd highly recommend \"Legal Remedy, Blonde mocha stout\" yes a blonde dark tasting beer that was oh so good! Very different, but really good! 

I had the Cajun shrimp appetizer it wasn't super spicy, it was good but I'd definitely try something else next time just because I think their menu won't have anything bad. The brisket sandwich was delicious, it's only offered on Thursday's if they have leftover brisket so I figured I had to try it while in town. I had it with cole slaw and the amazing  fried corn on the Cobb, and the black Betty for dessert- a great concept but not well executed. 

I liked the smaller menu you could tell everything was fresh and it all was really very good. Only thing I'd say anything bad about was the dessert, it just wasn't what I expected and wasn't very \"fresh\" like everything else was."}
{"text":"Fantastic pulled pork and vinegar based house BBQ sauce. Fried bologna was delicious as well. Service was friendly and efficient. Beers might be a buck higher than other places but food prices and portions make up for it. Definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"Beef ribs, beans, potato salad, cabbage, corn were all delicious!  Banana pudding was amazing.  

Service was a bit slow, otherwise I would have rated 5 stars."}
{"text":"Food was amazing and service was great.   We will go back again and save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"I love the house BBQ sauce. Also the Mac & Cheese was verrrry good. We finished the meal with the two desserts, the Banana Pudding and the Raspberry glazed cheesecake topped doughnut. Both were amazing!"}
{"text":"I have been living in Tega Cay since 2011. I have seen this location switch owners 4 times. I feel that this one will definitely stick. Very good and inexpensive bbq, quick service, and a great outside area for when the weather gets better. Love this addition to Tega Cay! (I recommend trying that BBQ Hash, either as a side or an entree)"}
{"text":"THEME RESTAURANT:
This is a tale of two BBQ joints in one Day: Gary's BBQ for lunch (adjacent review if you click my name or picture) in China Grove NC, and Dixie Pig in Tega Cay, just over the border in SC for dinner (this review).

First off, Dixie Pig is NOT a real BBQ joint: It's a theme restaurant masquerading as a BBQ joint, much like Olive Garden masquerading with an Italian theme. They serve only a partial menu of BBQ, missing such standbys as burnt ends, beef ribs, pulled chicken platters, or brisket sandwich... And brisket on Wednesdays ONLY!

The dining room is Dark and Very Noisy, though there was enough light over our table to read the menu, and it was clean.

Our waitress wasn't very friendly, she spoke fast and I couldn't understand her, even after telling her I'm hearing impaired three times, even though I pointed to my bright, big hearing aids.

I had the pulled pork platter with mac & cheese side. The pulled pork was dry & crunchy, which means it was WAY overcooked; and the mac & cheese was bland.

There were only four BBQ sauces:

* House, which was bland and not very savory.
* Alabama white, which was just buttermilk, mayo, and vinegar -- Bland, runny, and hardly authentic (but surprised they even knew about it);
* SC mustard;
* NC vinegar

I'm giving this restaurant two stars, only because it looked clean; and the menu had some interesting items not expected at a BBQ restaurant. Otherwise, Find Another Restaurant if you like BBQ

{"text":"Found Dixie Pig on Yelp. So glad we did. Wife and I shared pig wings, prime rib sandwich, pork belly, Mac n cheese and fries with the sandwich. Everything was so good we want to go back now."}
{"text":"Worst experience I have had at any restaurant. The bartender was terrible. She took our order and could not figure out how to order a grill cheese with bacon and tomato.  It came out as a BLT with a piece of cheese.  The other sandwich was a French dip.  Which I actually ordered a pork sandwich.  10 minutes later as I am eating it they brought out out pork sandwich.  The bartender told me items come out at different times for the group we were with.  I said I was just eating what they brought me.  She did not offer to get that sandwich for the person that I was eating.  I ended up paying for an extra sandwich for him.  She also could not get drink orders out timely I waited 15 minutes between trying to get refills on beers.  This service from her was terrible as she blamed me for all of it."}
{"text":"Food is good but the inside of the place not good . Dull and towards the back looks like a cafeteria . Guy bartender there is annoying and made me want to leave . 
I'll get the food to go if I go back ."}
