{"text":"Went there for breakfast with a friend of mine. Ordered 3 eggs over easy with wheat toast and bacon and hashbrowns. Eggs came out fried hard. We were sitting at the bar. I asked bartender if she could send them back please and she said cook was making some new ones? I got the next order and it was worse than before!! I'll never go back there! Brit the bartender was assume. The cook is awful. And I can't believe messed up my eggs twice!!! Ugh"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to us by a friend.  When I first walked in on a Sunday evening, I thought maybe it was a dive; however, we had one of the best meals ever.   The steaks are great and the service was wonderful.! Very friendly staff.  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Driven by this place a bunch if times, decided to give it a try since it's right by our house. Glad we did!  The good was excellent, service was fast & friendly. Good pub-style food. Definitely would recommend it and the prices are just right!"}
{"text":"We come here for the onion rings! They are served with ranch dipping sauce and it is amazing. It has a beer battered flavor to it. Always served hot.   Customer service is always great. We never had to wait to be seated and we are always were taken care of by our  servers quickly.   I gave it a 4 star because some of their entre items on the menu needs to go. Or at least revamped. Sometimes it just looks dry or unappealing on a plate."}
{"text":"Stopped by in between flights at the nearby airport. Pleasantly surprised by the service, food and beer. We had the Laguna Turkey Burger with fries and the Veggie sliders, all of which were served hot and tasty. Their house amber ale was also top notch!"}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood bar and restaurant.  The food is fresh and they use quality ingredients and condiments, even offering real cream for their coffee.  The service can be a little off sometimes, but everyone is friendly and professional.  The specials are unique and tasty and the portions are generous, without being too much.  They do need to adjust the air conditioning, it is often too cold in the restaurant.  When people are rubbing their arms and leave to go get sweaters out of the car-take note!"}
{"text":"We eat here frequently because the service and food are very good.  My only complaint is that they keep the restaurant so cold-that we don't come in as often.  If I have forgotten my jacket we don't stop.  We have told the manager several times about this and they usually adjust the temperature.  When customers get up, ( as I have seen several do) leave the restaurant, and come back with a sweater or jacket, that should give them a clue. Also, customers that are rubbing their arms are also a clue.  Other than that-food is pretty good.  I prefer fresh salads, instead of the bagged version, but everything else is well prepared and nice portions."}
{"text":"The BEST happy hour bar on the northside. Beers are $2 and all appetizers are half price. The graveyard bartenders are the best"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Best salad is the cuvee salad!!  Also, order the chips with ranch, they are great!"}
{"text":"This is one of my habitual go-to places for lunch. I usually get the Cuvée or Tapit salad, which are healthy yet filling and offer a nice combination of flavors. The cuvée has candied walnuts and smoked gouda, tossed in a champagne vinaigrette. Nuff said. The servers are speedy and friendly, as they know that we are all trying to get a quick bite before returning to work. That said, I have also brought clients here. The booths are nice for one-to-one conversation and there is a full bar, if you are in a jovial mood, or trying to get there. The prices are right-on for a sit-down place with a little class. The salads are just under $12, and they have have daily specials, which are a nice addition (I.E. Mexican fare and Taco Tuesday, yay!) Rumor has it this place is owned by the same family as the donut people. I don't know about that, but it makes for a cool story. Anyway, bottom line, this place is a lunch staple when you don't want fast food or chain food! Bon Appetit!  PS - the manager is Mike. If you have a problem, he makes it go away. If that doesn't work, take a seat at the bar and be beguiled by the beautiful and talented Stephanie. That should make you forget all your troubles!"}
{"text":"Normally I like this place for lunch always pretty good. Yesterday I had some friends in town that were leaving on an early flight so I figured we would stop in for breakfast @5:30am. Well we got there and the door was locked, nothing unusual here, but after repeatedly ringing the bell for several minuets the door was never opened. Don't know what was going on inside as the parking lot only had a couple of cars. After leaving we gave Re-Pete's up the street a try and was really surprised how good it was. Re-Pete's just gained a new customer and Whinchell's lost one."}
{"text":"I don't know why it took so long for my office to check this place out because we were missing out for months! It is so much better than regular pub food and I try to order new things and it always impresses! I like the Pesto Chicken and the Greek salad Pita. It's super fresh and delicious. The service is great too!"}
{"text":"Always pretty great food. Good service. The steaks are outstanding and love the chips n salsa.  Any time we have had a problem manger John always takes care of it."}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice now; once for breakfast and once for drinks. Both times the servers were friendly, willing to chat and able to offer suggestions with ease. Large servings at decent prices, clean dining area and bar, with a neat fish tank - this isn't your standard dim and dark pub. Would be glad to visit the location again."}
{"text":"Always good food. I have been going here with my family for at least 10 years. The food is always consistent. Its good pub food !  My favorite here is breakfast, I  enjoy the Eggs benedict , my brother loves the meat monster omelette its a big one with all the breakfast meats!  My husband and son seem to have their favorites too....they always order the homemade chips with cajun seasoning as an appetizer and the buffalo chicken sliders. My daughter is a wild card she orders a wide variety. She is the pickiest among us too ! She is always satisfied here. I  have to say this is probably my favorite casual neighborhood spot. They always have dinner specials which sound tasty and are reasonably priced . I would recommend Winchells."}
{"text":"Used to eat here several times a week. Went in last night, and was surprised at only one waitress in the dining area. Only 4-5 tables were seated, so I thought maybe it's a slow night. Sat down with my friend, we both ordered chicken fried chicken. 40 minutes later, the food arrived. Overall it was ok, the potatoes were cold, and the chicken extra hot.. The place has really gone downhill. Seems like it's become a \"slot players bar\" too bad... It was once a great place to eat with friendly staff."}
{"text":"Not a good experience.  Only ones at the podium, but long wait to be seated.  Dirty silverware.  Hair in the food.  Rancid-tasting food.  Snotty service.  Not going back."}
{"text":"I'd read many reviews about the quality food and service here. We waited 8 minutes before being given a menu or any greeting at all.  We ordered and waited far longer than expected for basic breakfast fare (stopped counting at 25 minutes). Once the food finally arrived it was actually solid. Tasted good. Service here was subpar at best but food was good."}
{"text":"Food is good.. Typical bar food.. But what makes this place so much better than other pubs is John.. He works the bar.. I usually get my order to go since I work nearby... He always makes sure my order is made correctly and give amazing customer service!!"}
{"text":"This place is nice and cozy on a saturday afternoon when its actually raining in Las Vegas. Its my second time having the San Francisco burger here. Same as before,  loved it and reasonably priced. Will be back to check out other items when in the area again."}
{"text":"Very good food and fair pricing. The staff are also top notch. I am picky so trust me this is an excellent pick"}
{"text":"I eat at Winchell's pretty regularly for lunch and an occasional breakfast/late dinner.  Service has always been good and, for a tavern, the food is pretty good (I've certainly had worse).   It can get crowded around lunch with locals, but for breakfast or a late dinner it's usually almost deserted."}
{"text":"This is a nice little bar that offers restaurant seating that makes for a great meet up spot for clients or friends. They offer a decent selection of beer on tap and the staff is friendly and remembers you quickly. They have specials on their food and have a good variety of the bar favorites and some not so usual treats like their stuffed avocado or calves liver dinner. They have the usual multi plasma set up with different sports games on each screen. The bar area has decent seating all around and their bar machines are not too tight( I've won my tab back on more than a few occasions) if they make any mistakes on your meal orders they don't hesitate to correct the problem and set things straight. All in all this is a great place with great service and good food, 5 stars in my book."}
{"text":"Good burgers a great place to relax lay low always nice folks always local Style never had a bad time there and they drove me home twice drunk thank you very much guys you go above and beyond your beautiful people"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years. It is a solid 4 stars. The daily specials are great. The Tuesday soup is awesome! (Chicken Tortilla). Friday night's Prime Rib is a staple! The San Francisco Burger, Philly and French Dip are my favorite sandwiches. Let's not forget the Cuvée salad, very nice as well.   Over the years this spot has been very consistent. Definitely one of regular stops. Oh, they do togo for pickup as well!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to place. Food and service is always great! Staff is so friendly and attentive. We've been here for breakfast, lunch and dinner. All is good. We also like to come in to watch football /baseball games. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"We come to this place on two occasions...that's day, and night...errr... just before dawn. It's another of those locals pubs that's pretty unique to Las Vegas and we've added it to the list of places to go if you want a better breakfast than many other locals pubs and a decent lunch as well. There are five locations in town but we've never made it anywhere but the Warm Springs one so far.   We come here before dawn when heading out of town, because it's a great place for a filling breakfast and then we can drop the car off at the RTC South Strip Transit Center and take the bus in to McCarran Airport for those flights that leave at 5:30 or 6:00 AM. It's become quite the tradition and it wouldn't be if the food wasn't worth it. The price is right, too, and often we're the only people in there at that hour but the person who is the server/bartender (and cook?) is always happy to see us and treats us well. The biscuits and gravy are excellent, as well as their \"Winchell's Scramble.\"  After coming here a few times for zero-dark-hundred breakfast, we decided to give lunch/brunch a try. Nothing too special, but good enough for the price and your typical bar food all around. The only thing to note is that the menu says breakfast stops at 11 AM weekdays and noon on Saturdays and 2 on Sundays, but the interpretation of those times really depends on your server. Luck of the draw as to whether it means 10:45 AM or 12 noon some days. Do plan ahead if eggs or a skillet are definitely what you crave and it's getting close to 11, even on weekends.  We've only been here for dinner once and never to drink at the bar, but service at all times was pretty good (except for one lunch where the server was clearly having a bad day) so I guess if we made it out there for happy hour or to catch a game on one of their many TV's it would be just as good.  Bottom line: Not a gastropub or even really a \"destination\" locals place, but if you are in the neighborhood or just curious, stopping in won't do you or your wallet any harm. As with us, it might even become a habit."}
{"text":"Very good food. Perfect for bloody mary's on a Sunday morning or a nice dinner with the family on a Friday night. The environment is family friendly for all ages and the wait staff is always very polite.  The menu is always changing with special and every meal is prepared perfectly. I love their french onion soup when it's the soup of the day. My husband and I are regulars and even when it is crowded there is plenty of seating and fast service."}
{"text":"I ate there 2 nights in a row after being pleasantly surprised the first time and not wanting to go to one of the nearby chain restaurants. Service is friendly, prices are more than reasonable, and the food is fresh (homemade dressings and tasty salads). Other unexpected plus: you get 10% off if you are staying at the Homewood Suites (just show your room key."}
{"text":"OMG....the drinks are strong!  I drink like an old, haggard bar maid but two Bloody Mary's and I was down for the count.  Would give five stars but cheap house vodka has given me a terrible headache.  Didn't have any food this go round but I've eaten here before."}
{"text":"The bleu cheese dressing is good.  Let me see, uh, the waffle fries are good for frozen spuds.  Not too much else stands out. The hamburgers are served with steak knives, which indicates they're not really meant to be eaten as hamburgers, probably because the lettuce is shredded and the buns are soft and flimsy. Let me tell you, for the money, I'll take Five Guys any day.  The chili is so bad that I've eaten day-old canned leftovers that were better.  None of the food is very good, some--like the hamburgers--passable, but for eating I'd definitely recommend another place."}
{"text":"\"I always enjoy this as my fist stop after picking up my rental car. Good food and I'm always treated well.\""}
{"text":"I just would like to  complement the chef at this restaurant!  I absolutely LOVE the cuvée salad!......all the favors are fantastic together!! Even the Gouda cheese!......mmmmm please do not change a thing!......have a great day! And keep on cookin!!"}
{"text":"Tina is apparently the most awesome waitress at this establishment. She works hard and hussels to make sure you get everything you need. She refills drinks without asking and she's got a great sense of humor.   I always get the gyro greek salad and substitute the gyro meat with chicken. The Salad is big but not shareable and it comes with pita bread."}
{"text":"Went to Winchell's as a last minute idea on a Friday night. We didn't have any wait at all. It was about 5 in the afternoon. Service was slow. Everyone seemed to be in their own world. Didn't get much attention unless we asked for it. He had sliders - said they were good. I had a California chicken sandwich.  The piece of chicken was very small. Flavor was bland."}
{"text":"Great location, greater food and selection and the Best waitress's and staff. This is not a place to pass up. Try it ...sampler platter, shrimp rolls, Reuben, avocado salad, chicken (oh my) pretzel bread! Have you tried the crown royal whiskey, with whiskey sour floated with Cabernet?!!! It's flu season CHASE it away. Your gonna love it!"}
{"text":"Just stopped there before waiting for our flight at the airport. Really surprised by the good food, good music, good sofas, good service... well good-everything of this place. Highly recommended !"}
{"text":"I stopped into Winchell's for the first time a couple weeks ago the bartender Michelle was great as well as all the staff when I stop by again the other night Michelle actually remembered what I like to drink I was impressed after meeting me for one time the bus boy was even helpful in my service Wilmer was his name and Michelle and Jen and Lindsey are the bomb great food great prices I love the atmosphere"}
{"text":"Run of the mill bar with above average bar food! That's how I would sum up Winchell's. Sure you can get a rum and coke anywhere but Winchell's food is awesome and the service is great.   As you walk in be prepared to resemble the 3 blind mice...it's dark in the bar area and takes a minute to adjust. I felt like I was blindfolded. The dining area is much brighter, windows all around and even an enclosed patio in the back. The menu has lots of items and they have daily lunch and dinner specials. The value compared with the quality of food is what impresses me most. Most items are around $9-10 and unless you are completely starving there's a chance you won't finish the hearty portions. I love the Chicken Club! The homemade potato chips are incredible and I'm not even a potato chip fiend. Any of the salads you get will be great mostly due to their homemade dressings....YUM. I even get the honey mustard on the side for my club because it's so tasty. The burgers always look perfectly prepared and the wraps are filling too.   The staff is really nice and the bar area has lots of TV's to entertain a sports loving group. There is a comfy little lounge behind the bar with a toasty fireplace if you're chilly. They also do a huge Superbowl pool when it comes time for the big game. Stop by, it's worth it!!"}
{"text":"As a Vegas local (as I like to think of myself now after 5 years), I respect the PTs chain here. I have met some great people who work at PTs and the service is usually the best. However, I just moved and the PTs that is located near my new home was not up to par. The two female bartenders were a bit oblivious to the things going on around them, so that is what brought me to Winchell's.   This Winchell's is in walking distance of my new place (plus), the food I had was delicious, but the whole menu is what has caught my attention. It has a great variety and I will be back to try some things. The service from the two bartenders at the time were super nice and got my group our new player cards. They had Third Shift for 2 bucks or some cheap number at the time, which was pretty awesome.   One of the managers was very friendly and said that during football season they have numerous TVs and space for sitting in couches and chairs right in front of them (MAJOR PLUS).   After my first visit, I am impressed. Let's see what my further visits unwrap."}
{"text":"I recently started working on the area, so as I'm scoping new lunch places, I came across Winchell's Pub.    I'm always up for good bar conversation and a little appetizer, so thought, why the heck not.  First time, lunch rush seemed to be pretty busy, if I'm by myself I generally will eat at the bar, quicker seating, kill some time watching whatever sports is on (yes, I'm a woman but love me a good game).  So I sat down at the bar, I was probably there a good 10 min before even being acknowledged by the bartender.  So right off, I wasn't completely impressed.  I ordered my food which came out very fast and made up for some of the time I spent waiting for an acknowledgement  when I walked in.  I finished and no joke, probably waited another 15 minutes for her to even look at me before I could ask for my check.  I get it, I'm not a guy she can flirt with to get bigger tips, though I am a nice looking, well dressed woman who tips very well when it is deserved.  So, I went back the following week, the food was good and it is about 45 seconds from work, so what the heck, right?  I walked in and maybe 3 people at the bar, GREAT, should not take that long at all.  I mean, comparatively, they were pretty busy the first time.  I sat down at the bar and noticed the same bartender working.  She was over at the side, eating, saw me walk in and still took about another 5 minutes to acknowledge me.  Okay, fine, everyone is hungry and has to eat.  I ordered and again, food was out in record time.  I ate.  Bowl is empty, she walks past me a million times in the 15 minutes since I've finished and still fails to acknowledge that I am done and may potentially want my check.  I flag her down after my annoyance level is up past my eyeballs and ask for my check to be closed.  Will I be back, sadly, probably.  It's convenient and the food is good. I may try the restaurant area next time, I don't know.  There is always the option, I guess, of putting a sock in my pants and a baseball cap on, taping down the girls and hoping I get some mediocre service but that just seems too difficult for a lunch break."}
{"text":"My friend lynn took me here the other morning.  As a food and bev director i am always looking at food, staff etc.    she told me the staff were like no other having been back three times she is right.  Wendy , happy cheery.  Lil Cindy so sweet, Mike , mario and franco the best bartenders ever.  And i have seen them all.   Feel at home when you walk in.   Mike , we will see you sat am.  Oh food excellent also"}
{"text":"This place is nice, customer service could be better. I had the sliders and they were good. They have good lunch specials but nothing 'healthy' overall, ok for a quick lunch w some friends, but I wouldn't go all the time."}
{"text":"This is the fall-back spot for Lunchies with Elite Emily (which could be a Food Network show at this point). But don't take \"fall-back\" as a bad thing... we wouldn't keep coming back here over and over if it wasn't deserving of it.  Life's too short to eat bad food!  Elite Emily loves the Veggie Pita Sandwich, but I'm more of a meatitarian, so I go for their Chili Size. We all know I swoon for a spoon of chili, and Winchell's chili is up to snuff -- good, sturdy, great as part of a meal or on its own. And they're very careful to ask if you want cheese and onions with it, which to chili lovers is a great touch, as sometimes they're good, and sometimes they overpower the flavor of the chili.  The Chili Size is an open-faced burger drowning in a sea of hot, gloppy chili goodness. Don't you dare try eating it like a burger... you will make a mess and we all will point and laugh. Loudly. Even more loudly if you're wearing white. Instead, grab that knife and fork and dig right in to some down-home goodness.  Service is very attentive, even during busy lunch hours, and the staff gets to know their regulars fairly quickly. We almost always have time to grab lunch, catch up on the latest gossip, and still have time to spare within Elite Emily's lunch hour.  Y'know, when I actually get there on time. **sigh**"}
{"text":"Your sliders are awesome tasty with the fruit cup as well good eats for three visits you guys earned five stars keep up the good work"}
{"text":"Nice little pub. Good atmosphere and even kid friendly. The daily specials are always amazing and a good deal. The breakfast menu is as good as the dinner menu. Nice wait staff that are very attentive and the restaurant is always kept clean. The restroom is also nice and clean and the layout gives you plenty of room at your booth/table. If you have any issues the Wait staff is quick to fix it for you and are very professional and friendly. It's a nice local spot that usually isn't horribly crowded. The beer is cold, plates and clean and the food is served quick."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for 8 years. Keno rocks and the food is great!! Try that Cuvee salad is the bomb!! The whole staff there is friendly, they make u feel like home."}
{"text":"Solid food at a decent price, not crowded, off strip. Dinner for two with drinks under $40. Would go again."}
{"text":"Love love love Dan and Rob!! The selection of booze is nice, food is good, bar food, nothing special but still good. Took away one star for no jukebox."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the food immensely and drink prices are very reasonable.  Pleasant atmosphere and good service.uh"}
{"text":"Having breakfast today. I really love my salads here BUT they have good omelettes too. The chili cheese is my favorite here. They make their own chili. O'Brien potatoes and sour dough toast."}
{"text":"My friend and I was stranded at Las Vegas airport with no hotel or a car.  We happen to stop by Winchell's pub and grill while walking with our luggage in 100 degree weather.   I had the chicken quesadilla, which was pretty good with the green sauces inside the quesadilla and a generous amount of guacamole diping sauces.    We had to wait 4 hours to get pick up.  We asked if we can stay in their lounge area for about 4 hours and they said yes.  The good part was that we didn't have to purchase anything while we were lounging in their area.  The waitress would come by and check up on us every so offten.    So come to winchell's Pub & Grill for great food and very friend customer service."}
{"text":"11.17.16 2:00pm Mom & I were doing a little exploring in the 45 minute wait I had until my foot & ankle Dr appointment around the corner.  I get a little nerve wrecked before heading to any doctor office so $4.50 Chardonnay actually hit the spot.  I pass Winchells almost daily so had no clue of what to expect & a long while ago thought it was a hot dog place lol.    Very clean, sports on the TV's, friendly customers, bartender, golf memorabilia & excellent ventilation!  We sat at the bar where quite a few people were smoking & did not smell it.  Also out of about 15 people, there was only one man, which I thought was pretty cool.  I've never been into a video poker playing type of sports bar w/ it not being a sausage party so to speak.  I will be back when I have more time & am hungry w/ mom.    Cheap wine, inexpensive food, but not totally bad cause I needed it before this appointment.  Clean bathrooms & non-smoking restaurant area located outside of the glass enclosed smoking bar.  Nice parking lot & located by many businesses."}
{"text":"This place came recommended by a friend and it proved to be a winner. We all met for lunch as they live in Hooterville (Henderson) and we live in Summerlin, it's kinda halfway.  Anyway the place is nice inside great bar seating with some booths off to one side. There is also a seperate dining room just up a few steps from the bar. They offer a nice selection of bottled and draft beers....four of which (drafts) carry the name of the bar. I tried the Winchell's IPA, very good. I failed to ask where it was brewed. The food was good; We started off with the Crispy zucchini wedges, very good. I had a chili size my wife had the clam chowder.Our friends had the San Francisco burger and California dreamin (chicken sammy).   All in all our food was hot, tasty and fresh. The service was above par for a sports type bar and our server knew the menu.  We'll go back as their dinner menu offered a wide selection of dishes and I'd like to try their other 'local' beers."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I had in Las Vegas. Located right by the rental car facility.   Had eggs and a ham steak the best. Buttermilk pancakes were big and fluffy!  Will be back!"}
{"text":"We always enjoy the food at Winchells, but it is usually dark out when we go. Got there at 5:00 PM tonight, and noticed how dirty it was. Starting with the welcome mat outside, probably needs to be replaced. Upon being seated in the indoor dining area near window that faces the Smiths parking area. You could hardly see out the window, I don't think it has been cleaned in years, and the wood blinds are full of dust, not just a small accumulation but months of dust. The glass partitions between the booths were very grimy. When I was being seated, the booth chair was very dirty. I started cleaning it while the server stood there and watched me, did not even offer to finish for me or bring a cloth to clean We will go back in a few and see if management has taken notice and cleaned it up"}
{"text":"Service was bad and food was gross the atmosphere was dead for a saturday night kinda weird"}
{"text":"Ok came here for the first time. Not a great impression. First we had to wait at least 10 min b4 being seated. because the hostess was to busy running around checking on other orders. The place was almost empty btw. I ordered the special which was the chicken piccatta.  it was gross overly bearing with a cheap wine. sauce was  very soupy like.My friend order chic tenders took one bit and said no.  I told them about the food and re order something the chic fried steak the veggies were cold and the gravy was lumpy and gross.  So my first experience was bad and I probably won't be be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I eat here at least twice a week. Great service too. Breakfast is amazing. Not to mention lunch and dinner are great too. They are not shy about the portions either. Just a great neighborhood place to eat. Oh and kids are welcome."}
{"text":"I will never come back.  The food is good, but my God the smoke is horrific.  The bar area is glassed off, but does nothing to shield the smoke in the dining room.  My eyes were burning and I felt like our drinks and everything were tainted.  I felt bad that I was exposing my daughter to it.  We ate super quick and will not return."}
{"text":"Way too long to get your food. Sat at the bar side to have the servers totally forget us. Went to the bartender to get some to go boxes and was ignored. Waited waaaaay to long for the check. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"The mini hamburgers were awesome ! The San Francisco burger is the best ever ! I will definitely  come back ."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this location.  Great TVs. Great food! Staff calls you by name. It is relaxing and playing poker is part od the relaxing time."}
{"text":"Good eats.  I've dined here twice. Once during dinner hour, once at 4am. Both times the food was of well-above-average quality, especially since this venue is really aiming to be more of a 24/7 VP bar than a full-service restaurant. The venue is generally well-kept & well-appointed.  You'll probably make out at about $15 a plate here, but the food won't disappoint. Especially compared to the other off-Strip choices available in the middle of the night. It's clear the owners care about quality of product & service.  Drop in sometime.  UPDATE: I've dined here several more times. Each experience confirmed my above evaluation."}
{"text":"Stopped in recently to catch a Charger game and found that it was already catering to a Jets crowd.  I have eaten at two of Winchell's locations and found the Cuvee salad to be a most excellent suggestion."}
{"text":"Do as the locals do. That's what brought us to Winchell's for dinner. It has the usual pub fare -- burgers, sandwiches, meat, and greasy appetizers. And they did it all well... just enough to add it to my \"could go to again\" list. And I think that's an important list to be on.   What really put this on the map and pleasantly surprised me was the steak -- it was tender and flavorful, not the rough and stringy meat I usually have at pub/brewery/restaurant type places.  It's totally out of the way and off the strip -- more for locals than tourists, but if you're looking for some greasy food and want to avoid the crowds, this is a good option to consider."}
{"text":"The food tastes like fast food. It might be good for the locals but as a traveling guest, I was not impressed. The French fries were greasy."}
{"text":"I love this place. I am not a big drinker so I mostly come here for the food. Everything I have tried here has always been good, consistent and flavorful. The service is always friendly and portion sizes always force us to have left overs. I am so down with that. Try the San Francisco Burger or triple decker San Francisco grilled cheese. Both are ridiculously sinful and bad for your figure, but so worth it. Also, order steak fries with them. Yum!"}
{"text":"still great service and menu choices are awesome!"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY love every single person working there. I have nothing negative to say about any of bartenders. The food is great, and I couldn't be happier to have a bar so close to home. Thanks for everything guys!!"}
{"text":"We were meeting friends for some good conversation and a casual meal. Winchell's seemed like an excellent choice. We took the corner booth in the back of the restaurant. Even when most of the tables were filled, it never got too noisy for conversation. The service was excellent. On Saturday night they have ribs on the list of specials. A half rack for $13. Included with that is a choice of soup or salad. Plus you get fries and slaw. What a value! I asked for a little extra barbecue sauce on the side. First time I can remember getting side barbecue sauce that was still warm. Is this Gourmet dining? Nope. Is it good food, great service, and a great value? Yes."}
{"text":"Always great food and service. Breakfast burrito is awesome, cuvée salads are my favorite and the burgers are very filling. My fist visit was late night and the food was hot! I expected sub par because of the hour. I was impressed!! I recommend all the time and get thanks for the recommendations!  Try it!!"}
{"text":"I called in my food order so i would not have to wait there for it.  i was there in about 6-7 minutes  after i had called because i live nearby. i went inside and let the host know i was there for my food and since it wasnt  ready i went ahead and paid for it then. while waiting i saw some food orders come out of the kitchen, then 5 min later some more came out, still waiting the host came by and i said how much longer, she checked and said your food came out didnt you get it? i said no (clearly i did not have any food with me) finally i was told that my order was accidentally given to someone else! i had to wait for it to be made AGAIN, no discount or anything offered to compensate for my time, so I give 2 stars"}
{"text":"This is the place to go. Friendly atmosphere the staff is so nice and welcoming. I love the beer and food. You must have breakfast here. Amazing!   Keno games pay. Did I say the food is just amazing bar food. The pizza and tacos. WINGS ARE DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"My previous review was almost over three years ago when I stopped in for a happy hour.  Three years later I was lucky enough to have family that wanted to grab breakfast here so I decided to give it another try.  Man was I happy they made the suggestion.  Service:  I have now gone back three times, and have had the same waitress.  She is friendly, attentive, and remembers our ordering habits which give this place a good old fashioned feel,  Food:  I have only had breakfast, but this will be my go to spot in my neighborhood going forward.  The portions are large and tasty.  I actually need to go in some time after 12pm or for lunch as I imagine I will enjoy it just as much.  Overall:  Three years has made a world of difference.  I plan on being a customer for years to come."}
{"text":"Chili and beer. Is there anything better??   Really, is there?   Food is great. Service is great.   Eat the chili and ask for their seasonal on tap."}
{"text":"Gaming is tight but they are good with complimentary drinks. They have very good pancakes other food not to bad.  I think they could turn lights up a little very dark inside."}
{"text":"This is an alright chain, 24/7 bar. It's got decent food, ok beer offerings, and friendly staff. It's almost always on the emptier side. The bartenders are attentive. The gaming options are what you'd find anywhere else. It's got a nice ambiance and decor. All in all, it's an a-ok spot to stop in for a drink or bite to eat. Hint: They have a housemade ranch that is quite tasty."}
{"text":"Bad. Bad. Bad. We did not receive any service from the waiter.  We only got drinks from the host. After waiting for 15 minis and asked the host several times for our waiter, the mysterious waiter never showed and we walked out. Please don't go to this Winchel's, instead go to the one on Warm Springs Road. Better service and better quality."}
{"text":"This bar that shares it's name with the donut store my mom used to take me to as a kid is a grown up bar and grill. I'm always looking for good food late, and this place delivers. With either sit down or take out, this dark lodge like bar has fantastic food. Order their signature sliders or the Chicken Driftwood, or the Gorgonzola fillet, and your bound to be surprised at what this gaming bar has for bar food.  Breakfast is served until 11 during the week and noon on Saturday and 2 on Sundays!! I sat down for an extremely late dinner the other night and ordered a dinner salad with balsamic vinaigrette and a BLT. Although my salad wasn't the best side salad I have ever had, i was grateful for the real dinner at 11pm. With so many gaming bars in the valley, it is always nice to have a neighborhood place that I can get a steak or a salad."}
{"text":"Love the pretzels and cheese appetizers And the San Francisco grilled cheese is amazing Great service too. Great for lunch or dinner"}
{"text":"Always love this place! Great food and they have the nicest employees! I can always count on them to get my order ready fast! Especially love the service from Daniel,Cindy, Ronnie, Travis and Wendy !  Such a great place to go with your family even thought half of it is a pub it doesn't feel like one. Good place to get peace and quiet, they also offer a nice outdoor patio covered perfect for the morning or mid afternoon!"}
{"text":"awesome winchell's grinder sandwich with their amber beer.  Went on Monday to watch a game since the hotel I stayed did not have liquor license. So Yeah."}
{"text":"After eating here regularly for the past 4 months we r hooked!  My husband loves liver and onions and claims these r the best after eating them at several places around Vegas.  I favor the San Fran grilled cheese!  Rich and full of flavor!  Prime rib Special is very good as is all the specials.  I enjoy all the beers so just saying, can't go wrong by this place.  Service is great and food is served hot and is consistent every time!  Good job!"}
{"text":"Good food. Fantastic service. A very nice place for a local hangout or to just have a few beers and talk football!"}
{"text":"The food here was the best food i've ever had at a bar. ever. i ordered a pizza and the crust was doughy and delicious and the cheese and meat left me wanting more by the time i finished it. Not to mention that the damn thing was HUGE. The price was more than fair and our waitress was awesome and funny. We offered her 20 bucks to hit my friend with the pepper shaker. She didn't wanna do it but ended up lightly tapping his forearm with it, to which he screamed bloody murder. Her name was emily i think."}
{"text":"Had the tuna melt there last week. Really bad. Hardly any tuna on it. $9.00 for this tuna. Wont be back there anymore."}
{"text":"last Wednesday I had the BAJA COB SALAD! My only word was OMG! I was curious about the Spicy dressing and Jalapenos on this salad but WOOOHOOOO! This was a terrific taste event! I loved it!  Dressing on the side did help keep calories at bay but that's my norm.  Today, FRIDAY I had the Fisherman's Platter. My wife had the AWESOME Grilled Salmon.  I don't normally have Fish Fry but this was a super special tasty meal.  As for the SALMON! My family always loves the WILD SALMON meal event.   My wife and I always enjoy the BAR AREA Where the staff are always an entertaining and Friendly service anyone will feel comfortable with. The gaming is always generous and will always keep us coming back.  Thank You WINCHELL'S Pub and Grill! You are the BEST!"}
{"text":"A friend and I went here for lunch.  The place was busy so we ate at the bar.  The service was outstanding and the food was great.  I had the Southwest Wrap and my friend had the Mediterranean wrap.  The food came out quick and was delicious.  We will definitely make it a weekly lunch stop."}
{"text":"This is a decent place to grab some food near the airport when you need something quick and easy on your arrival or departure.  It seems to have more of a bar with food type atmosphere and could be compared to a local version of an Applebee's.  Its a decent sports bar type atmosphere as well with adequate TV's to view from most locations."}
{"text":"Very bad Experience! I won't be wasting my time or money again.  Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm, Our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed. Maybe he was cooking our food too. He did manage to get us our second beer so that was nice. We had rush though our meal, when we finally got it. I had a french dip slider with onion rings. The meat had a lot of gristle in it for as small as it was, my onion rings where good as was the ranch."}
{"text":"Great food and amazing service!  We come here so often that they already know our order as soon as we step foot in the door. Haha it's safe to say we are regulars here. But they have a great selection on the menu. Definitely worth a try, guys!"}
{"text":"Pretty sweet place!  I like it better than all the other little gambling places in our area.  The food is better than Black Mountain Grill or PTs or Village Pub by a WAYS.  Servers are pretty friendly, good atmosphere and they will comp your food too, not just drinks, if you play.  Very nice.  SOLID.  BTW: The food is a few steps UP from regular bar food.  Just go and enjoy.  :)"}
{"text":"Went in to try the chili size...a meal that's always been one of my faves.  Got mine with the homemade chips and the whole dish was just excellent.  Even though the chips were really good, if I would do anything different it would be to skip the side, but add extra chili to the dish.  I'll request it that way next time.  My wife had the hot roast beef sandwich special, which she really enjoyed.  Service was excellent.  We enjoyed this place so much that we went back a few days later for breakfast...chili cheese omelettes, absolutely terrific and again the service was just excellent.  It's very easy to suspect that we'll wind up being regulars here."}
{"text":"Basically a freindly staff.  Food was good.  Drinks were average.  They had no problem putting on whatever NFL game we wanted."}
{"text":"It's been along time since I've seen a waitress provide the kind of service Jenna did! She was awesome and very attentive. Great job Jenna winchell's is lucky to have you!!"}
{"text":"Winchell's the bar NOT the donut shop; I definitely like this place over a PT's or a Homeplate establishment anyday of the week! Stiff drinks, GREAT food [excellent house made potato chips, try 'em!] and very nice bartenders."}
{"text":"I LOVE Winchell's pub and grill, Their food is top notch and should not be rated as just bar food, I have 2 children and we eat there every sunday for breakfast, My whole family meets there every Wednesday evening for dinner and the Service is GREAT, the food is phenomenal,  great location, atmosphere is is very warm and inviting.  Cuvee salad, it may be the best salad I've ever had and the Portobello chicken entree is to die for.  Try it, you wont be dissapointed"}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular here except that the location is close to the airport.  We were able to get in and out within 45 minutes.  Food similar to TGI Fridays and Chilli's.  Service was average.  Manager did stop by to see how we were, but didn't seem to genuinely care IMO.  Good option if you're strapped for time and don't want to eat at the airport."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch. Little bit of a wait time to be seated, but not unusually long. I got a stuffed avocado salad, my husband got the Philly cheese sandwich, and my mother in law got the cuvée salad. Food was out quickly and tasted great! I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"For bar food, it is amazing! Wait staff are attentive and make your dining a good experience.  The choice of sliders are unheard of and very good. The chilli burger was the \"best.\" Make sure you try their soups, home-made. Very different types of salads. We'll definitely be back to try their daily dinner specials. Prices are good. I would have given 5 stars, but the bar atmosphere did take away from the dining. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"If you think this is the doughnut shop u r an idiot read the listing Winchell Pub and Grill. The soups are off the charts made fresh daily.  I love the service Stephanie, Kat, Amy, and John are the cream of the crop."}
{"text":"Terrible service, we waited 20 minutes just for the salad and soup. Our server was in training, so we technically had 2 servers, so you think someone would check on us more than every 20 min. We waited about 20 min after finishing our food for a server to come to the table for the check and to go boxes. At one point we tried to get the to go boxes from the bartender and he flat out ignored us, looked right at us and continued to talk to the other customers. If felt like, since we weren't \"regulars\" there, they didn't care to serve us. The food was good, we would have totally come back, but the service was so bad, we will never be returning."}
{"text":"5:20 am rang their buzzer to be let in no answer so left was a group of 8 so we just found somewhere else"}
{"text":"When it's late and you want a pint and some wings, this isn't a bad spot. Granted they aren't free range organic, but better than the stuff you'll get at BWW. The place is usually empty after 1am, so the service is great."}
{"text":"Really a 3.5-star place. Decent bar food, smoke free, and well located.  Lunch is very packed, so come before 11:30.  They have some interesting takes on classic barfood, but their burgers and fries are great.  Drinks were a bit weak for the price, and the \"outdoorsy\" decor isn't really my thing."}
{"text":"I love Winchell's. Just some good ol' fashioned food in a friendly, neighborly atmosphere.  I first started eating here because my then, girlfriend (now, wife) worked here when we met. I've never really been impressed with the food that you can get at neighborhood bars around here. It always just seemed like something to keep you busy between drinking and losing all my money on a video poker machine...not anything I would go out of my way for...and certainly not the star of the show.  But Winchell's is different. They have food with flavor. Classic delights like calf's liver and onions with bacon, fish & chips, and salisbury steak are done with an unusual finesse and a skilled hand. But I usually go for a late night snack and those dinners are only available from 5pm-11pm.  Where Winchell's really shines is their sandwiches and burgers....one particular burger comes to mind: The San Francisco - served on a grilled parmesan-sourdough loaf and loaded with homemade thousand island dressing and swiss (wipe the drool from your mouth...you don't wanna ruin your keyboard). As a matter of fact, you can request that bread on pretty much any sandwich.  The Cuvee salad is another favorite: a delicate balance of mixed spring greens, candied walnuts, smoked gouda cheese, apples, grapes and chicken all tossed with a stringent, yet sweet champagne vinaigrette. By the way, all the dressings are housemade. Did I mention that they make their own potato chips too? And that they're delicious!  I've tried most things on the menu here and I have not yet been disappointed. The servers, bartenders and bussers are all friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is warm and cozy. This is a diamond amongst the lumps of coal we have scattered throughout the valley."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out and possibly catching up on some sports!!!! Also their bartender Stephanie is wonderful! Shes great to talk to and great at what she does!   Food is good for a bar like this!!!!   Coming back here next time!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here. We LOVED this place.  Great service and the food was awesome. We told them it was our first time and the manager stopped by to introduce himself! Great experience, it's our new hangout!!!"}
{"text":"Great bar ... Everything you could want in a neighborhood pub ... People are great and friendly and life is good at the end if the day."}
{"text":"Love this pub, my favorite one in town!"}
{"text":"Best food and prices near the strip. Nice staff! Great food and good bar selection. Manager Mike is awesome! Food is awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"Solid fours stars.  Came here during the week with my husband for lunch because he raves about the salads and he was right!  They were delicious!  I had the stuffed avocado salad solid 4/5 stars.  You get a choice between tuna salad or chicken salad.  I chose chicken. Pretty good would just suggest less mayo. Ice burg lettuce fresh with crunch.  My husband got his usual the chef salad. 4/5 per him. Loaded with ham and turkey which he couldn't finish. Place is clean with friendly staff. If this was closer to my work this could be a regular lunch spot for me but as far as I know nothing close to summerlin area. Would definitely come back when in the area."}
{"text":"We are at Winchell's on a regular basis. The bartenders and wait staff and very good.  We enjoy the food, and particularly like the breakfast.  The Sunday morning breakfast specials are normally great!   Good food and good times!. Good staff"}
{"text":"A little sports bar by the car rental facility in Vegas. Typical bar with typical bar menu but turned into a great memory because of the attentiveness of the bartender, the heaping quantities of food and the well made drinks."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service! The food is decently priced with HEAPING servings. I've always seen this place and finally decided to try it....instantly became upset with myself for taking so long to walk in lol"}
{"text":"Awsome place. We found this gem right after picking up a rental car and it is wonderful. Great service.  Great prices.  Great food. Kids love Mickey Mouse pancakes.  Good French Toast. Good eggs Benedict."}
{"text":"Awesome pub! Love it! The food always makes me happy. The amazing staff at Winchells do an outstanding job with a smile that makes you smile.  Good people make the establishment without them a building is just a building.  This place has an award winning staff and they back it up with amazing food.  I've gone to a lot of pubs and for one reason or another they just didn't feel like a place I wanted to be come s regular at. When I walked into Winchells I got amazing service and it didn't matter if I was playing or not they just take care of you and make you feel welcome."}
{"text":"Winchell's is a nice neighborhood pub.  They offer good food at great prices and plenty of drink specials throughout the week.  It's a good place to take your friends for a few rounds if your not feeling like the strip and want more of a local experience."}
{"text":"My favorite Winchell's Pub in town.  Been coming to this bar for years and the food is your traditional bar food.  The bar itself has a glass enclosure due to the smoking ban, which sucks.  The bartenders over the years have had their ups and downs and the turnover has been your usual bar turnover.  Not going to blow you aways in overall experience, however, if you around and want a drink this is one of the better bars for a quick drink or some late night food."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday night for drinks. I had the French Onion soup & it was delicious! Drinks were good, service was excellent & great prices. Would go back. :)"}
{"text":"It is what it is - bar food at a gaming bar. The daily specials are always reasonable, the service is always with a smile, and it's close to the office."}
{"text":"San Francisco grilled cheese with chicken... One of the tastiest I've ever had. Gotta come by and check this place out. Nothing bad to say about this place. Great neighborhood bar and all around great staff. Come by and see Johnny, George (or El Jorge as I call him), Franco, Kat and the rest of the gang. It's always a good time."}
{"text":"Just another boring bar menu for breakfast. The service was good and the area was very clean. But the food was tasteless, actually that was the only complaint I have."}
{"text":"Where do I start, I LOVE THIS PLACE food is always fresh to order, bartender are the best drinks and food are priced at a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Four of my friends and I went to Winchell's a few nights ago on a whim and know we'll be going back.   I have lived 2 miles from this place and just got around to giving it a try.   We all had nothing but good comments here.   Maureen's seafood pasta looked delicious and, according to her, was just that.  Large scallops, shrimp and other fish in a great looking creamy sauce over linguini.  She ate every bit.  Sandy and Jeannette loved their Reuben sandwiches although they both had to take half home because they are huge!!  The sandwich is served with a marble rye bread that they particularly liked.  My French Dip sandwich in a Ciabatta roll was one of the best.  I love this sandwich but not always good in some places.  This one was exceptional.  Very tender, juicy stacked beef, thinly sliced to perfection on a very fresh (maybe too fresh) Ciabatta roll.  Not to salty au jus for dipping made this a darn good meal. I swore I would take half home but ........:-)  Tons of very crispy french fries, sprinkled with a zesty seasoned salt could get me to love french fries again.  Ditto on the coleslaw side.  Service was excellent.  We overstayed our welcome because we were enjoying the conversation as we always do and no one tried to rush us out.    The  menu is large and the prices are very reasonable for the portions served. The restaurant is divided  by an enclosed glass smoking section completely  apart from the non-smoking section.  .  We liked that."}
{"text":"The wife and myself stopped by yesterday for lunch.  I have seen this place many times on my way to return the rental car, but never stopped before.  It was a pretty decent lunch.  I had a Rueben sandwich with fries and the sandwich was a triple decker and very moist.  The fries were nice and crisp and the service was a little above average.  The place reeked of cigarette smoke, but being in Vegas a person tends to get used to that.  I am glad that I stopped in and will come back again when in the area to try other things."}
{"text":"Great find off the strip reasonably priced and all made from scratch sauces. We ate here 3 times and everything was terrific!!!!"}
{"text":"Half price pizzas and apps after midnight! Tim is super! My boy and I always have great conversation with him and he is so laid back. The first time I was here I didn't know how big the apps were. We always get chicken strips and fries, which is plenty for 2 people with the munchies.  Havnt hit the royal flush yet :-/"}
{"text":"I eat at Winchells 3-5 times a week. The servers on the restaurant side as well as the bartenders are always GREAT. My order is never straight off the menu because of my diet.    It's always a great experience."}
{"text":"I love this place staff is friendly and food is great! The Cuvee salad is amazing and on Fridays they serve a prime rib special that's excellent also. It's walking distance from the airport rental car place and the Las Vegas outlets also. Football food specials are delicious! The \"Totchos\" or 1/2 lb hot dog is a must try! :)"}
{"text":"We kinda waited awhile to get Sat. I Think the server was busy with to go's  but the service was good I was a little disappointed in the food but we were starving so we ate it plus I don't like to send things back. The wonton wrapped prawns were way over cooked and the nachos said melted cheddar and Jack but they came out with canned nacho cheese sauce all over them not my favorite. It should say nacho cheese sauce on the menu. We added grilled chicken and it was not even seasoned but it was cooked well. Chicken fingers came with a bunch of broken pieces I think we got 1 full finger. Looks like we got whatever was left over in the bottom of the bag. So mixed review this one is closer to my house but I think the food quality is better at the location on Warmspringd Road. 3 stars is definitely for the great service though!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here a few days ago to have the chicken parmesan. This is definitely my favorite dish at Winchell's Pub and Grill. A friend turned me on to this place a few years ago. Friendly atmosphere and great 80's music. If you're in the area, stop in and try the chicken parmesan! Yummiest item on the menu."}
{"text":"If you have a large party don't go here! Hey aren't able to accommodate large parties (like 8 people) expected us to split into groups.... totally could have seated us together but hostess already sat two people where large parties sit."}
{"text":"Tim the graveyard bartender is rude.  After waiting for 30. Mins we finally asked him  for a drink then he gets our order wrong.  Only reason it gets 4 stars is because I had great service before his rude ass.  Never again I will be here after 12"}
{"text":"When I think \"Winchell's\" I think of the donut chain around the west coast.  I was mistaken as this version of Winchell's is a locals joint serving drinks and decent food.  While I don't know if I'd come here to drink myself silly at night, I know this is where I could come for a dependable lunch.  Favorites here include their San Francisco style grilled cheese, which includes a soup of the day.  I tried their heart attack of an avocado burger, which was not only hearty but incredibly rare (I ordered medium!). Well, least it came with a side of \"homemade\" chips.  With their bright outside seating and dark interior, Winchell's offers a mix of both worlds and a solid lunch.  Prices are reasonable and the parking is decent.  I would definitely see myself coming back here again."}
{"text":"It doesn't matter what you order even dinner at breakfast - it is always so good! The service is awesome and you can always get a table when you go there or belly up to the bar! See Horea for fast impeccable service!"}
{"text":"We had breakfast here this morning after reading all the reviews about how good it was. Well, they are correct, breakfast although a little slow to get to us was excellent! A bit smokey for early morning, but not too bad. Strong coffee in little white mugs (coffee shop type) tasty potatoes, eggs cooked correctly, clean S&P shaker and Ketchup bottle (pet peeve of mine). Corned beef hash from a can as usual, but crisped up nicely! Will go back soon :) Check please, was 12 and change for two ;)"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, the service  is really good ad well. They take care of their customers . You can tell people enjoy working  here . I had a classic  burger with cheese came with lettuce  and tomatoes.  For being a simple burger it was pretty good . I did wish they had more of a selection  on their burgers . I also had their mild wings which are nicely done there crispy and just enough  sauce they arnt even wet enough  to make a mess which is perfect for lunch . All around  great place I'll be coming  back ."}
{"text":"Nice place to grab a late night dinner. My wife's veggie sliders were great and my salad with Pyro sauce was pretty good as well. The busboy kept our glasses full and gave my wife a to go cup. It just took a little longer to cash out but other than that everything was great  Update review just had the chicken club salad and it was freaking amazing absolutely huge portion with an onion straws on the top that were nice and crispy and fish can't say enough about the salad"}
{"text":"Good food nice  .big portions warms my tummy. I love that it has a vast variety in its menu. I have been here on holidays and it is like home cooking. Nice pancakes too. This is a must for breakfast. Nicely priced specials."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a few years now. Good food, good service! Try everything! haha.."}
{"text":"Wow!  What a shame my wife and I found this place on the last day of our trip because the food and the service was AMAZING! And it was reasonably priced unlike all the other places we tried on the strip. We will be back because the seafood pasta actually had seafood and it was ALL cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a fan of bar food, but this place can rock! They have fantastic salads. The homemade potato chips are a decadent indulgence.   They have a greek salad that is normally served with gyros but they swapped me out to chicken. It's one of my favorite salads around town.  I ordered a fish dish that was tasty but too salty for my taste. I also went with a friend who ordered the ahi salad. It came dry and when he asked the waitress for dressing, she seemed befuddled and offered blue cheese. (Blue cheese and ahi??) Turns out it was supposed to have an asian dressing on it. The waitress was clueless.  If I hadn't had those experience, this place would get 4 stars."}
{"text":"This is a great place to sit down and get your food pretty quickly and the food is better quality than the places that are big breakfast places nearby. The service is great."}
{"text":"Had a horrible experience with the food waitress from the moment we sat down. Very argumentative with no customer service skills. Ruined our dinner, couldn't stay because we were so insulted with her behavior. We probably will never go back!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere reminded me of a cabin in the woods, and the food was just as enjoyable. The service was fast and friendly, the kitchen was happy to sub a side for me, and the price was right on point. I'll likely be back next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great spot for good food.  The service is OK, they are good at accommodation big groups or parties. The atmosphere is that of a standard bar/ restaurant. I would recommend this place for a casual party or group get together.   The food was good, very few issues. We went with a large group and most had no complaints. The skillets and potatoes were favorites for sure. The ham steak was overcooked and dry. The Patty melt was medium well and cooked just as it should be. The bread was toasted and warm. The onions were raw and a bit hard to handle. Cooking them a tad would have made a huge difference.   Its worth a stop if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I have always had a great lunch experience with Tiffany, Keri, and Tina. The staff is friendly, the service is great,  and the food is always outstanding.  We are always in and out and back to work on time."}
{"text":"Absolutely the BEST food in town!!  Huge salads, delicious seafood on Friday nights, including fresh salmon.  Every Wednesday nite fabulous pot roast & meatloaf with great gravy.  Thumbs up to Will & Ronnie who are pleasant servers!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! French dip with waffle fries and zucchini wedges were really good! Prime rib special with green beans and bake potato was awesome for $19.99. Excellent service!"}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for a great club sandwich, beer, football games and a little Keno at the bar.  Location is off the strip and easy to get in and out.  Anytime I am in Vegas and want a quick lunch or dinner without breaking the bank,  I stop here."}
{"text":"My number one local restaurant for a quick meal 24 hours a day. I live closer to Applebee's but Winchells offers a better standard of food hands down."}
{"text":"This place is very consistent when it comes to the food. I absolutely love the clam chowder and the fish and chips and everyone at my table always says that the food was good as well as the service."}
{"text":"If you're already a regular here, congratulations you're getting great service. If they don't recognize you, good luck. It's not just my party, it's throughout the bar. A pedestrian beer selection and an unimpressive menu with horrible service. You've been warned."}
{"text":"This place is really laid back. I'm so happy to be here today trying new food and places."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to go to breakfast Saturday morning. On our way to Lumberjack we saw Winchells and decided to try it out. I will start with the good....the service was good and very reasonably priced. The reason for the 3 star rating was the temperature of the food. It was not warm almost cold. The flavor was good but could have been much much warmer. The other reason for rating is the smoke. Even sitting in the dining room the smoke smell was strong.   We may give it one more try."}
{"text":"No frills place serving breakfast, lunch, and dinner. We came around 12:30pm on Saturday and we got to seat ourselves. I ordered the veggie skillet with a side of bacon and sourdough toast  and the boo got a Cali skillet. Since he didn't want toast, our server asked if he wanted to sub for a pancake, and I nodded my head for the both of us. Our food arrived quickly and it was DELICIOUS. I ate my food so quickly I didn't even stop to take a picture- this rarely happens! The pancake... I don't know what it is but it didn't need any butter or syrup. It was light, sweet, and the edges had a tiny bit of a crunchy texture- seriously?! An amazing pancake at a PUB?! yessssssssssssssss!   Our server was very attentive, sweet, and checked in to make sure we had everything we needed. Needless to say, we will be back and next time, I'm ordering a huge stack of pancakes to go alongside my meal."}
{"text":"Amazing, humongous, gigantic salads.... awesome prices and foods!!! I really enjoyed speaking with the service here they're very sweets and very generous servings are served!"}
{"text":"Great service and food! Normally I have to send my eggs back set the kitchen but they were able to make them perfect the first time which speaks volumes. The bacon was cooked to perfection as well"}
{"text":"UPDATE:  The manager was totally amazing after I had to go back and took care of everything. The final pizza is absolutely amazing and delicious. Disregard the following.  I was told to come here because the pizza is really amazing. Well I am here to tell you this is inaccurate and the service is plain awful. At 6:50 PM tonight 2/21/18, I ordered a 16\" margarita pizza with thick crust. They tell me 20 minutes so I show up at that time. No one who worked there acknowledged me nor looked at me for at least ten minutes (mind you they weren't busy). When I finally get my order it takes another almost ten minutes for them to get me back my change and they short changed me! I get home and the pizza wasn't right at all. It had no sauce and it was two pieces of thin crust \"glued\" together with butter that they claimed was thick crust. Uh no....so I called back and told them what happened and asked for just a plain cheese pizza with thick crust. I wait another 30 minutes before going back and guess what? NO THICK CRUST. This is completely unacceptable especially when they aren't even busy. Very disappointed and won't be going back."}
{"text":"We just located to this area  from only a few miles,and wanted to find a neighborhood pub. Since we walked into the place we were welcomed with a warm invite. Mike is the best. Remembered our names. When We came back Met the GM and Cheri  tonight , and they are great !Food is great , staff fantastic."}
{"text":"It's OK. nothing special. ok food nothing special on tap that makes you have to go there."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and had the SF burger.  Okay tasting.  The server was not very friendly and the smoke from the people at the bar was overwhelming."}
{"text":"One star goes to the bar tender who had great customer service and the other star goes to how clean the place was.. now here's my disappointment with this place... THE FOOD!!! I completely understand this is a dive bar and food isn't always up to par, however, I ordered the most simplest dish on the menu and it was disgusting. The patty on the sliders were burnt and old with no flavor what so ever (no salt/pepper) and it took them over 20min to bring it out. I took one bite and spit it out. I don't understand how some of the reviews said this place had fresh food, when I didn't experience it."}
{"text":"While the wait staff was pleasant, the food was subpar.  I had the gyro and the meat was overcooked and the lettuce was iceberg.  Plus no beer on draft.  Not a pub.  Disappointing.  And the waitress watched me the whole time I ate."}
{"text":"Great food but the assistant manager does not know how to treat customers.   Months ago, my party waited a long time for the food to be delivered.  This assistant manager came by during the meal and asked how everything was.  I told him it was good but we waited a long time to be served.  His response?  \"Well I'm sure it was worth the wait.\"  Last week, we waited for someone to come to our table to take our order.  I flagged down a bus gal, asking for someone to take our order.  Again, the same assistant manager came over and asked what we wanted to drink.  After giving him our order, I said we were in a bit of a hurry and would like to go ahead and order.  His reply?  \"Oh, I'll take your drink order but I'm not your server.\"  He then turned around and left the table.   We then had to wait for the server to come over to take our food order.  Had we not been in a hurry, we would have left."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite neighborhood bar!! Johnny-the swing shift bartender is the best!! Food is great (i love the gorgonzola filet), service is awesome and the atmosphere is very nice also. I highly recommend this bar for anyone who wants great food from great people!!!"}
{"text":"We order takeout from here at least once a week. The food is really good -- the buffalo chicken sliders and hot turkey are out of this world -- but the service is awesome. Even with takeout, servers are pleasant and my food is prepared quickly and is always good. A fabulous mainstay for weeknights!"}
{"text":"We got through the first set of doors then turned around immediately, the smell of cigarettes was extremely over powering. Gross."}
{"text":"Eat at this place often for lunch because it is very close to my office. Their Cuvee salad is  amazing! The service here is always good as well.   If you are looking for a sports bar type atmosphere, with good food and good service, I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"First of all, this is not the donut house.  That's what I was thinking when the homegirl chose Winchell's for lunch.  Come to think of it, she's always choosing a pub for lunch.   Pros: -Cheap eats.  Food here is priced pretty good.  Example:  8 oz filet for $21.99.  Ton's of daily specials and lunch specials.  -Wide selection for a bar, grill, and pub -Taste:  I say you get what you pay for.  Nothing taste really bad, but not excellent.  Again, it's cheap.   -Dining room seating or bar seating -Video Poker if that's your cup of tea -Plenty of parking.   Cons: -Smoking:  It's a bar and pub, should be expected.   -Dark inside -Service is not the best.  Took a while for our orders to be taken, even longer for the food to arrive.   -Wide selection of food, but not the best place to if you're watching your cals.  I tried their 8 oz Filet and cup of chili.  The filet was little dry and tasted close to a NY Steak.  Still got my protein from it, so I was happy.  The chili here was my highlight. It's topped with onions and also has a little kick to it. I almost got seconds, but figured that it was best that I didn't since I was trying to keep the calories a little low for the day.   Overall, the 3 stars means that the food here is just okay.  Don't let the 3 stars discourage you.  Winchell's is a good place to hang out with friends and even get a meal in. I'll probably be back again to meet the homegirl for lunch.  Otherwise, I just don't see myself going out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"This review is for the Winchell's on Ann & Simmons... they used to have the best food ever, but as of the past 2 years, the service went down hill (I've had times where I've gone in and haven't gotten a refill or condiments, and the server just never comes back except for the check and tip..) and the food is just greasy and disgusting. They're using cheaper ingredients, but raised prices. WTF, Winchells. I used to like you, and now you're like the pimply kid in Math Class that flicks his boogers at people."}
{"text":"Winchell's is always on our list of lunch destinations; they always have great food and daily specials. Their soups are always very good! Today I had a side salad, which was good per the norm and ventured to try their wonton wrapped prawns, which are a new item on their appetizer menu. I guess I was expecting something a little different and do not think I would order them again. I usually get the chicken club (add avocado) with their homemade potato chips! I will stick with the usual from now on, which is the best! The service is always exceptional and we will definitely return again & again."}
{"text":"Good and tasty lunch, reasonable prices, friendly service. I've been here as a petty of 2, and a larger party of 8 or 10. When the 10 of us walked in at noon, they did everything they could to find a way to seat us, then sent two servers to take the order and serve the table. I most certainly will go back there."}
{"text":"After eating at WInchells every few weeks, we decided to give it another try. New menus, new higher prices and new wait staff. One order got mixed up with someone else's and we got the wrong food. Asked for extra gravy, didn't get it, roll was suppose to come with one of the dinners (apparently they ran out of rolls) and garlic bread was to come with the Chicken Parm (grisly) didn't get it. The runner had an attitude when we brought it to his attention. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"My family and I are on vacation in Las Vegas and have gone to Winchell's twice. Each time the food has exceeded our expectations. Everything about this place is great: the food, the service, and the prices. If you're staying at Tahiti Village and want to eat somewhere other than the hotel restaurants, then definitely give Winchell's a try. It's truly fantastic, and family friendly!"}
{"text":"FOOD IS DELICIOUS! Stopped in for a quick bite to eat after a day of hiking before returning our rental car. We had the california burger, philly cheesesteak, and the salmon special. All were incredibly flavorful and generous portion sizes for a reasonable price.   Service however, was slow. Most tables were full (not surprising for 7:30 on a Friday night), but we sat for probably 10 minutes before we even received menus and then another 10 minutes for just water!   So as long as you are not in a hurry or incredibly parched from hiking, a great choice to stop at!"}
{"text":"Bar food... Yah that's what it is. What can I say besides it was slightly higher quality then bar food. Because technically it is bar food. The only thing that I most enjoyed, was getting to sit outside in the private dining area and not having to smell the smoke while eating breakfast. Being an ex-smoker, it doesn't bother me when people smoke around me, just when I have to smell it while trying to enjoy the taste of my food. Isn't a big part of the taste of food based off of the sense of smell as well?   They had brunch specials that day for Father's Day, so I tried the Belgian Waffle with fruit. Which also came with eggs, bacon and potatoes. I also asked for an English muffin on the side. The waffle was slightly overcooked, but the fruit on top was delicious. The English muffin tasted stale and the bacon was a little under cooked for me. I guess I am a spoiled brat now when it comes to food, but this just wasn't satisfying.   What really disappoints me is when foreign items are found in food that should not be. My son had a hair that was cooked TO his French fry and a couple days later I heard another person in our party also found a hair in their meal. We were pretty much done eating after that discovery. Sadly hubby left hungry still and I can say we will never return."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place.  The franchise strip mall bar grills in Vegas typically offer mediocre food but not here.  The first time here I tried a chicken sandwich that had a pineapple slice, onion strings, bacon and teriyaki sauce and it was the best sandwich I had in months!  The fries are my favorite kind of seasoned fries that are basically straight versions of Arby's curly fries.  I am so glad I gave this place a chance because now I know where to go when I'm on this side of town."}
{"text":"Love this place! Excellent service! Great food! The perfect place to stop on your way to/from the airport. Never had a bad meal or service. Takes me back to the great, old feeling restaurants in Reno! You have to check it out!"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out.  Kind of like a Cheers; where everyone knows your name.  Food was good & bartenders friendly.  Will definitely go again. :)"}
{"text":"Great food for the price and they will cater to what you want. The service and bartenders are top notch. Love this place"}
{"text":"Wow, what a good find, I was recommended to go here because I was hungry at 3am... ended up ordering the shrimp roll. a huge shrimp wrapped in a wonton and fried... they were sooo good!... but the downside was that they only have late hour happy hour from 12am-3am and I just missed it... they were expensive, if I had unlimited funding I would have ordered 20 of them though!"}
{"text":"Food good first time here , nice cold beers services is great . Chill place and clean  .. bartender   Was great his name is mike . I will be coming back and it's just down the st"}
{"text":"The place easily satisfies. Every....single....time. These days, for most joints, that's an accomplishment. Oh and the Gyro Salad is absolutely the real deal."}
{"text":"Winchell's must be under new management or something....I've always gone there over any of the other 4 major restaurants on Eastern because the quality of the food was always good and way above anyone else. The last times they failed very very badly. A cheeseburger that was raw and attempts to re cook it failed ( they did comp the meal) and last night out of 3 items only the cheeseburger came out ok. We ordered 2 of the carnita special plates, the only thing hot was the tortolita ?  During the summer we would get their BBQ special platter and had more than enough food for 3 days and you thought you were in Texas! Applebee's was 100 % better over the weekend and Chilli's has also been good so what happened Winchell's? You are only 5 minutes from us and have always enjoyed the food there."}
{"text":"This location can't be beat for a work lunch. It's right in the middle of several corporate parkways near the RCF and outlet mall. It's a quick drive from where I work.  I had the Stuffed Avocado Salad with Chicken Salad and Honey Mustard. I really enjoyed this salad. It is definitely a splurge salad versus a healthy salad, but that is why I ordered it. I love salads that include a boiled egg. The scoop of chicken salad on top was creamy, tasty, and generously portioned. The price of the salad was right for a quick work lunch as well.  Service started a little shaky with nobody manning the hostess stand. Once finally seated we had another wait before our waitress arrived. Once we ordered things went smoothly from there. It was a short wait on food and checks arrived at the right time. It didn't take the waitress long to get us cashed out and she was kind enough to ask how the check would be split when she took our orders. My coworkers have come here many times and said that initial empty hostess stand was very odd and not how the restaurant normally runs.  I enjoyed my lunch and expect that I will only like this place more on my next return."}
{"text":"The food is good, the service is good but unfortunately the cigarette smoke in this place is a major turn off. It didn't really bother me too much while we were eating but when we left all of my clothes and my hair reeked of cigarettes. Yuck! If you don't mind smoke this is a good place for a quick friendly meal."}
{"text":"Is it cute or frustrating that yelp doesn't have Vegas friendly categories for video poker restaurant hangout bar. This is not a dive bar, it's open 24 hours, so it's not necessarily nightlife.   I used to live by 215 and Eastern and if I didn't get robbed and kicked out by the bitch mother of who I was living with (I cleaned her place more than her son ever did), I'd still be frequenting this area. I felt I had to move away from this area too soon, there's a lot going on in this corner of town that hasn't been tapped and overexposed by the trendy masses.  I drank at this place all night until it was time to order breakfast. I had been taken here by a friend when I used to work in Henderson (at the defunct Spaghetti Factory) and Horizon Ridge gave me a Chico (California)/ down town San Jose and Down town Vegas  feel to it. We bar hopped walking back and forth twixt here and Red Hawk most of the night. And I have no idea why people reviewing Red Hawk left this out, they're like complimenting bookmarks on a good night of debauchery in the area.   Great food, great drink specials, and God you feel like hell when the sun comes up. And you're there a couple of weeks later rinsing and repeating.  Oh, I mentioned before but I better in this review... This IS the same family that runs the classic winchell's donuts. So why don't they serve them here? I don't think it would take apart from the other breakfast items on the menu. I think it would even bringin more drive by breakfasters!"}
{"text":"I was craving Nachos bad, so we ended up here. The food was good, nothing too special. The spinach and artichoke dip was very good though. Monica the bartender tonight was awesome! She was very friendly and attentive from start to finish. She's the reason my review is 5 stars."}
{"text":"Such great food ! Very attentive service! Winchells feels like home ! Great for football and any night out"}
{"text":"I went here on a lark with my lovely wife last week and had lunch.  The first thing I got was a nose full of cigarette smoke which is trapped in the front entrance.  We sat outside on the enclosed patio, and it wasn't bad.  The appetizer (a hummus dip and olive dip) was strange and not what I expected,  I couldn't call it wonderful, but once again, it wasn't bad.  My wife ordered a frisco style burger and I had this grinder.  It was the worst sandwich I have ever had in my life.  I took one bite and I was done.  I have to admit the waitress (who was really nice and a good server too) kind of warned me that I might not like it, and I should have listened.  She offered to bring me something else, but I just shared my wife's burger (which was excellent). The waitress was kind enough to remove the grinder from the bill, you will be happy to know I tipped her as if it was still on there! So, the place aint bad.  It aint great.  It aint bad.  I think I will give it another chance, and will update accordingly if things improve."}
{"text":"My husband & I come here all the time! Fun place great bartenders. Great food and great slot play!"}
{"text":"Just sat at the bar for 15 min. No one serving anyone. Guy bartender just walked past me twice. Never asked me what I wanted or asked if I needed a drink. Great service you guys have over here"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times and had lunch there Tuesday, May 17, 2016. They have good number of lunch specials and the food is made to order. The service is good and they do have a number of mounted TV's so if you want to watch a game this is the place. The menu offers a good variety with something for everyone. Never a long wait and the serve staff does check on you. They do a good job on refills. Prices are reasonable and even though it is a Pub with a full bar the dining area is separate so family dining is available.  It is very convenient, with good food, service and prices so I will be back."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch.  I was surprised they even serve breakfast here, friends told us about it. Nice cafe type atmosphere.  Friendly service. We had three of their platter breakfasts.  All were good tasting and large portions. Coffee would be my only complaint, tasted cheap and week to me. I would go back."}
{"text":"San Fran grilled cheese. Holy cow. Amazing. I don't get very excited about grilled cheese but this stuff ROCKS!!!! Has sliced tomato, avocado, and three different kinds of gourmet cheeses and that really thick bread. I know it had to be extremely fattening but I didn't care. Heaven on a plate. YUM!!!! Service is amazing here as well. Will be back here for football for sure."}
{"text":"We came to this location as it was close to the house and we really wanted some good food.  The last time we were here was on St. Patricks day and it was memorable, so we decided to come back.    We had some other people with us, one who ordered a burger with cheese and it looked amazing which was a huge surprise to me.  I looked at the burger and was WOW, that is huge.  I was told the taste was really good so this place was put on my list as a place to go back to and grab a burger someday.  The rest of the food was pretty good as well.  They do have freshly made chips you can order as an appetizer which we did with ranch which was not bad.  We ordered a steak which was ok, it was not the worst steak I have had but by far not the best which boils down to the quality of the meat they order for the place and use.  The cooks are pretty good at making it the way you ordered it but you cannot help the quality of the meat, you can only do so much with what you are given.  I will go back to this place again to try the burgers, it looked to good to pass up."}
{"text":"I thought all Winchells would be the same but I found different.  At this location, the Corned beef was very fatty, they only gave you three pieces which were cut think but mostly fat you could not eat, potatoes, cabbage and carrots.    Overall it was not seasoned so it was a little bland and just ok.  Last year this location was a LOT better.  The Bartendar, she was somewhat paying attention but when I was done, it did take her close to 15 minutes to come get my money and close out my tab.  I will keep this place on my list however at the end of the night I went to another location which for some reason was much better quality and they gave you Irish soda bread with your order which I did not get here????"}
{"text":"I love the festive atmosphere here.  These people do holidays big time!  Machines pay!  We has Osso Busso for Valentines dinner special!  A family enviroment.  Kat during the day is great or Johnny at night.  There are a lot of local gaming bars but this one is special."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! BIG burgers, great chili cheese fries, awesome chicken dinners, etc. The service is fast and efficient, the wait for food is short and the taste/quality of food is fantastic. Keep up the great job you guys!"}
{"text":"For starters.. this is my usual goto spot as I live pretty close.. never have a complaint about this place till today. I Buzz the door to be let in.. And I wait for someone (other guest) to come open the door for me. I'm usually greeted as most bar tenders know me. But today there was a bartender there older guy with white hair. I've seen him plenty of times. But never have talked to the guy. So I'm served a drink.. I play 160 at the bar. He walks past me several times after I'm done with my first watered down Jameson and ginger. Doesn't even click apparently but he serves other guests. Any way.. a ladies comes up and gives me a water without me asking for one?.. um ok. So long story short I'm down 160 at the bar and here he is sitting and talking to some guy in a red shirt and baseball cap, no uniform that keeps going in and out of the kitchen.. looks legit.. That's who's making food? So this guy is talking to this \"cook\" about tips and who works the hardest, and who should get what amount of tips...  hahah. Well then. I think It's been a real pleasure guys but I'd rather LOOSE my money else where.  I've provided 3 stars because other bar tenders aren't as bad as this guy. Hense why I kept coming back. But thanks for the 160 dollar watered down whiskey and shitty service. I appreciate it."}
{"text":"This place has the most amazing food, my fiancé loves the open face turkey & gravy dinner, I love everything they serve:)!!! The cocktails are awesome as well.This place has a dive feel to it. The dining area is really dark so I couldn't see the look of the dining area to well, it smells of 50year old  cigarettes. Overall the service and the food is awesome. BEST FOOD EVER;)!!!"}
{"text":"I have to admit, it's been a while since I've been here, so I'm catching up on some old reviews, but as a former Henderson resident, this place was one of my favorites. I don't know if a lot about it has changed, but we always loved the chips they made in house, and would sometimes make trips to Winchell's just for those."}
{"text":"We were looking for someplace close to home where we could get breakfast on weekends. We tried Winchells for dinner and it was great. Good menu, good Margaritas, good service, good music and the Giants on big screen! What's not to love? Definitely be back."}
{"text":"As you exit the Las Vegas Airport , Winchell's is right across warm springs rd. We are used to Winchell's Doughnuts here is California . So just the name of the restaurant was a reason enough , for us to consider eating here .   I dislike doughnuts , so the idea to eat here  was not pleasing to me , but we were hungry. Service , Ambiance , Food ,and Pricing ..was Awesome and quit a pleasant surprise . I highly recommend The Winchell's Pub & Grill."}
{"text":"We dine here at least once a week. One of our favorite place. The food is good, and service excellent. Restaurant non-smoking or you can dine in the bar if you want to smoke. The last mother's day special was the best breakfast we have ever had in 10 years in Vegas. I had seafood omelet and my hubby had filet mignon with eggs. Wow."}
{"text":"Went with my dad last night (6/18)... I honestly don't know what's so great about this place. Way understaffed the night I went... Took nearly 15 minutes just for drinks to arrive at the table. Service in general was very slow. Tried their hot wings... weren't even remotely spicy. The ones from Pizza Hut are way better lol. It's just your run-of-the-mill sports bar. They have all of the sports games, that's pretty much the only cool thing about this place. Other than that, I don't recommend it."}
{"text":"Winchell's serves two purposes .   Purpose 1: You're off the strip somewhere in the suburbs with old highschool buddies. It's hot outside. I take it back, you're actually melting. You want to smoke a Marlboro 27 and put a cold beer up against your face. Simple, go to Winchell's.   Purpose 2: You're drunk as (insert profanity here) after a late night party and you want a grilled cheese sandwich.    No perks and the food is mediocre at best but hell, it's vegas and the locals need a place to hang out minus the tourists and relatively close to home.  Don't try to order pancakes past 12 in the afternoon. \"The cooks would normally do it past breakfast if the manager was here to say it's okay but like, the manager isn't here\".   :: Scurries off and doesn't return for 20 minutes::::  Next time, I'll just pick a station casino for a $ 3.99 Breakfast all day long.   Kthanksbye."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all....Ordered Take out,,Waitress was too busy to get my food,,,Bartender couldn't be bothered to get my  order either.   I can find 20 restaurants in 10 minute vicinity that would be happy to take my money.  I don't know who manages this place, But it needs help.  Most customers are in the service business ,,Employees should be aware."}
{"text":"Food was good. I got a veggie pita, which was good. But I honestly think that their menu doesn't have a lot of stuff to choose from. I'm a meat person, so if I have to go with a veggie dish, then everyone will know that I don't know what else to get :( At least what I got was yummy.   Great vibe. Service was good. Our waiter was very attentive. The only disappointing thing was they didn't take credit card the day I went there. I rarely have singles with me, not to mention $15-$20 cash. So I had to withdrew cash from their ATM, which of course added additional fees to the meal...   In general, I think it's a good place to hang out around the airport area but to me, this place doesn't stand out from all other bars & pubs I've been to."}
{"text":"Always a great atmosphere and service is amazing. And let's talk food as you know I'm about food. Yum yum yummy. We've come and enjoyed time during the swing and graveyard shifts and the food is consistent and timely. I recommend their Greek Salad  which is amazing. Also they now have personal size pizza  and if you've ever had the Hidden Pizza at Cosmopolitan it tastes just the same. So in other words you won't go wrong with anything you order. On last item that's a must their French Fries  dipped in ranch or by themselves they are wonderfullllll ..... so when you get the chance stop by Winchell's have a few drinks, play a lil poker or Keno at the bar and eat some food and make sure you say hi and take care or those waitresses, waiters, and Bartenders"}
{"text":"Great service, great meal. Tried the Friday prime rib special. Cooked to order and yummy. Served with awesome baked potato and tender vegetables. Will certainly return. Machines still tight but had fun anyway."}
{"text":"We got no service we waited 10 minutes nobody even seated us smelled  cigarettes yuck"}
{"text":"Chicken fingers were good. The ribeye was good. Nice portions. Clean bathroom. Attentive staff. Not extra smoky. Open 24 hours. Small yet varied menu. Will probably be on our late night munchies list."}
{"text":"I couldn't possibly love this place any more than I do. This is my go - to spot. The staff, the food, everything is just wonderful. I'm 2000 miles away from.my family,  but I honestly always feel at home here. Mario, Lindsey, Wendy, they are all just wonderful."}
{"text":"Great place, Great bar!! One of the best services I've had in a while. You all rocked the Buffett for Super Bowl this year!! Loved it! 5 plus stars for sure... You'll be seeing me a lot more!! ;)"}
{"text":"When I think of the name Winchell's, I think of fresh delicious donuts and hot chocolate.  Little did I know there was an all-adult version serving up cold brewskies and typical bar fare for those who woud rather waste calories on beers instead of donuts.  Because of its location, I decided to have a little Happy Hour here for some coworkers and staff.    The manager, Michael, was more than accommodating and very friendly from the get-go.  I called some days ahead to give them the heads up and they let me know there was a private patio room they would seat us in.    We had pre-ordered apps so they would be ready to start bringing them out as soon as we got there.  Unfortunately, the patio room had a couple of AC units that seemed to be working on overtime as they sounded like planes flying over head.  In addition, the room was very echoey so we couldn't hear each other talking at all.  I could literally be sitting next to someone and if I wasn't looking directly at their lips moving, I would have no idea what they were saying.  The food came out and it was all typical bar food.  We ordered a few appetizer platters which came with fried zucchini, 2 wings, 2 tenders, mozz sticks and I think that's it.  The wings and tenders were dry and unappetizing. I was very unimpressed with the appetizer platter altogether.  We also ordered chicken quesadillas, nachos and fries, which were all decent. The nachos were my favorite.  Imagine a mountain of chips placed within a large taco salad bowl (genius, in my opinion!) and drizzled with cheese, sour cream, beans, salsa, guac and chicken.  It was perfectly warm with the right amount of each element.  It was a little messy to eat and probably awkward given the professional setting, but still yummy nonetheless.  The service became painfully slow as the next two hours progressed.  Our poor server was this quiet timid older woman who would manage to sneak in and out like a ninja without anyone who wanted to order a drink seeing her.  Someone would say where's the waitress, and someone else would say, she just came in and grabbed some empty plates.  It went on like this all night and I had to constantly run out of the room to find her, bring her in, and yell across to room to make sure everyone got a chance to order a drink.    No one ever came to buss our tables so we ended up bussing them ourselves and putting all the dirty dishes onto one table.  It was appalling.    If not for the decent nachos and Michael's friendliness and willingness to accommodate us, I would have given this place only two stars.  But to be honest, even with its 3 stars, I sadly will not be bringing my monthly happy hour party back here again."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience yesterday.  Normally, eating lunch in the bar while playing video poker is a positive experience here but not yesterday.  Bartender I'd never seen before.  She did not ask our names, nor did she introduce herself, so it was difficult to get her attention when we couldn't call out her name.  Her boyfriend was in costume, sitting at the bar 'playing.'  She spent more time with him than she gave to all of the other customers combined.  I had iced tea, hubby had iced water.  We spent $180 gambling.  We each had a sandwich for lunch.  The nameless bartender charged us for both sandwiches, as well as the avacado on my BLT&A -- $21.62, and she couldn't comp it!!!  Couldn't get her attention because she was so focused on her beau, so I had to leave the bar and go to the restaurant stand where I asked restaurant wait staff for the To Go Box that I wasn't able to get from the Bartender because I couldn't get the Bartender's attention because of her boyfriend.  Due to the level of service, we left a total of $23 -- that a tip  of $1.38.   Immediately upon arriving at home, hubby had gastro distress and RAN for the bathroom.  Two hours later, same thing happened to me.  We were both nauseated.  Can't help but wonder if someone in the kitchen had dirty hands, because we did not order the same thing, but both sufferered sudden intense gastro distress.  One we used the toilet, the nauseau passed and we were both fine.  I threw out the leftovers.  Unusally for this Winchell's, the place where I sat was dirty.  Lots of food crumbs; I later realized they were onion rings crumbles.  Once again, it's because the Bartender wasn't doing her job; she was busy with her boyfriend in the dumb dinosaur costume.  (Several days before Halloween, I might add.)  I hope management discusses their expectations with this young lady.  I know this is not Winchell's standard.  I even said out loud to my husband, ensuring the Bartender could hear, \"Oh, there's food on this machine.\"  Anyone else would have brought over a rag and cleaned it.  Not her.... back to Love Boy instead of working.  I will return but hope to not encounter this Bartender again.  The others are professional:  They introduce themselves; they ask our names; they pay attention to their customers; and they comp enough of our tab that we feel our business is valued.  This young lady fell short in every way.  She needs remedial training and a firm word from management or to find a job elsewhere, IMHO."}
{"text":"The Cuvee salad is the BOMB!!! Always think I'll have something different, but always go back to the Cuvee!."}
{"text":"Awesome lunch spot.  Fries are great and the Mediterranean wrap is fantastic. Huge salads."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. I really can't stand bar restaurants because this place really smelled like smoke. If you don't smoke, it is very uncomfortable.  However again the food is great. The special turkey pot pie was fantastic. The portion size was perfect for one person. The turkey, peas, carrots, broccoli and potatoes were delicious. My husband got the chicken scaloppini and it was so flavorful. His potion was much larger than mine but it made for a great lunch the next day. The service was wonderful. Our waitress was very friendly."}
{"text":"I thought this was a great hidden gem! Their food is really good and drinks are reasonly priced. All the bartenders here are very friendly, and it's funny cause everyone thinks it's the donut place! Do not be fooled, this bar definitely meets up to its name."}
{"text":"The BF and I were driving around trying to find a late night meal somewhere new. There's only a handful of places we rotate past midnight and sometimes you just want to find something else.   He remembered from a different Winchells that the garlic mushrooms were good. I love fried mushrooms and indeed these were solid, good flavor and crispy. They normally are on the menu in a appetizer platter, but you can order it solo for $5.99 I think.   BF wanted breakfast so he grabbed the chicken fried steak and eggs. The CFS was nice, crunchy and had a decent gravy. The BF said that the home fries was the best he's ever had. Indeed they were nice.  They were perfectly crunchy outside, but inside was fluffy and soft. Sometimes great comes in doing something simple right.  I wanted to get a hearty salad so I opted for the Cuvee (spring mix w/ apples, grapes, candied walnuts, smoke gouda, hearts of palm, broiled chicken, champagne vinegrette). It was a really tasty salad that had a bunch of stuff I love. It's the kinda of salad I would put together for myself, but it's like I'd never have all those things on hand to make a hearty salad at home. The chicken was juicy and it was crusted with garlic and herb, ingredients were fresh and it wasn't overtly dressed.   Service was decent and friendly. On a random note, sitting by the fish tank was nice since I do like watching stupid fish chase each other around.   I've been to two Winchells now. I liked this Winchells better than the one further east on Craig. I think they cooked everything much better at this one so I think I'll come back to this one."}
{"text":"Had a Yelpacious UYE planning  luncheon or at least that was the plan though we talked 80% of the time about randomness.    I thought it was a nice spot but felt the other branches (like the Warm Springs one) was better in their food quality.   I had the Kentucky Gold Chicken sandwich which was a grilled chicken breast with cheese, bacon, fried onions and BBQ sauce and was served with fries.   My sandwich had good flavors, but a tad too well done chicken that it could have used more BBQ sauce to moisten it up. I just think our food sat on the pas I little too long so it was lukewarm, not hot.   On a random note, all the locations have different menus....still wondering why so? Franchises? Just keep that in mind in case you have a favorite dish at one Winchells, to check the menus online to see if others have it too.   I'm a fan of Winchells for bar food, but I don't think this is the favorite location."}
{"text":"Lovely staff.  Friendly, attentive and very flexible and accommodating for business meetings and groups. Classic bar food options with surprising elevated options, too. The enclosed patio seating is sunny and private for group meetings. VERY enjoyable experience that has been consistent.  We've been using Winchells for business for 2 months now. :)"}
{"text":"Most racist place I've been to my whole almost 40 years on this planet. I sat down for approximately 25 mins. and no one came to take our order. I asked to speak to a manager that never came. I told one of the 3 waiters that served the whole room which was at least 20 people that were 65 and over and Caucasian that we were leaving because it seemed like they didn't want to serve us, his response was \"oh well\".. unacceptable! Disgusting and ignorant behavior."}
{"text":"We love this place.  We make it a point to stop in whenever we're in Vegas.   Their burgers are on point.  Great food and great service at a great price!"}
{"text":"This is just for the bar, not food... yet.   We stopped in here from some drinks after dinner and to play some video poker. The bar atmosphere is really nice. Dark woods, big roomy bar. Bartender Michelle was super friendly. She convinced us we should come back and try their food, especially steak night on Fridays. She also had great suggestions of other places to try. My husband and I both won money at the bar which is always nice!  A friendly place to pop in."}
{"text":"Always great place to come in to. Smiles everywhere and food is always hot and fresh. From the burgers to the daily special I love it all. This lunch time is not only a break from work but a little break from reality:)"}
{"text":"such a rude staff!!!! we were meeting a bunch of friends for drinks spent over a hundred dollars.. ...then we stayed and ordered food.  they waited till our food came and we were eating, the female bartender was like you need to move now?  we were not at a machine but was next to one, nobody was waiting? she was so rude?  we will never come back!!! Kept telling us to move now?? For who I said...I'm not blocking a machine? Don't go.....not worth it..."}
{"text":"This is the perfect place to come and either wait to pick someone up from the airport or to grab lunch before you have to catch your flight.  Irish Pub type feel to this place, with a cozy warm decor and friendly staff.  Bartenders are all great here.  As far as gaming goes, this is a pretty standard bar for gaming.  Drinks comped while playing.  Have had better than average success on their machines.  As far as food goes, they have many of the same types of bar food as other Las Vegas style bars but kind of add their own flare to them.  Pretzels, wings, quesadillas, and sliders are all great appetizers here.  One menu item is surprisingly fresh and delicious.  This would be there salads!  They have a few outstanding house salad specialties that you should try.  Once the bartenders know you, it's a very welcoming bar!  Definitely a nice change of pace from the usual places we all go.  I'd recommend to anyone!  Give them a shot?"}
{"text":"This is our go to for a great bite to eat and to stay away from fast food.  Our absolute favorite way to start is their fresh potato chips (make sure to ask for them to be fresh and hot). they are served with ranch and a great way to start the meal.  We haven't had anything we didn't like, their hamburgers are great, big, juicy and handmade.  Their spaghetti is meaty and rich, sliders are the bomb, we have not had anything we didn't like.  Once late in the evening we did get a basket of reheated chips but never again have we had that happen, but I do make sure to tell the waitress to make sure they are fresh.  We have always had the best service also, waitresses have always been great and attentive.  Thanks Winchell's"}
{"text":"First time at Winchell's tonight with my family. Right away the servers were right on top of it. We had the  crispy zucchini,it was great. The Hot Turkey was awesome. My girls had the sliders and a burger with wonderfully crisp french fries. My husband had the chicken fried chicken was out of this world good. Our servers were all wonderful and so nice. Definitely will be returning.  Thank you guys."}
{"text":"Love the food here! Everything I've had when we've been here has been awesome. They put avocado on a good amount of their stuff...what more could you want! Prices are reasonable. It did take a minute for someone to get our order but once it was put in the food came out pretty quick. Nice atmosphere. Only ever been during lunch hour. Love stopping by when I'm in this area of town"}
{"text":"Had a very good spinach salad with avocado , chicken etc . I liked it with a balsamic that was mixed in. Reasonably priced at 9.95."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been looking for a neighborhood place for us to have a quick dinner. We decided to give this place a try since it is very close to home.  When you walk in you can go to the right where the bar is and tables for eating or you can go to the left for restaurant seating. We were greeted right away by our waitress Taylor who was very sweet and a great waitress. My husband ordered a pizza and I got just simple chicken fingers and fries. They were both fantastic!  We saw other meals come out and everything looked so good. The desserts looked so good but we were full from our dinners. We can't wait to go again. My only complaint would be the air circulation. Even though no one was smoking in the restaurant area, we came home smelling of smoke. I would have given 5 stars if I didn't smell when I left."}
{"text":"5 stars for Gregory! Funny as I met him and he stated where he worked at, I say alright, I'm going to come and get coffee. He said coffee, I'm like yeah. Not even knowing it's the pub bar and grill. Hahaha   The reason for the 1 star is because I walked in and sat at the bar, a lady with blondish hair is counting the drawer, ( to clarify,  I was in no rush) but looks exactly at me and didn't even acknowledge or say 1 moment, I'll be right with you!  She just kept counting!! That is  POOR customer service. Won't ever go to any of their locations.  I will Remain Loyal to Four Seasons, Mandalay Bay, Signature @ MGM, & Bellagio!! Apparently, ****J.A. was offended as he does not like my review! I could care less and I'm pretty sure if he wasn't acknowledged after sitting there for almost 10 minutes, he would feel the same- WE ARE ALL ENTITLED TO OUR OWN OPINIONS. That's why it's called A REVIEW- NOT FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE YOU HAD- FROM #MY OWN EXPERIENCE!"}
{"text":"Great food and good service. The food is very consistent every time I have gone. During the week they also have some pretty good specials that differ from day to day. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"The first time I went there I had the Cheese Burger and Fries  and the Apple pie and it was good.  The Second time I had the chicken wings hot and they were good.  This last time I had the French Dip, with turkey and it was good. Today I had the Patty Melt with grilled onions and tomatoes on rye bread and I had the home made chips and it was real good.   Each time the service has been outstanding.  I understand it's just bar food, its fresh, quick, the place is clean and people are real friendly and we like going there.  If you want a cold beer and some good food, give Winchell's a try."}
{"text":"Solid upscale bar food. Have been here several times and the food is always solid. Tonight I had the chicken pasta special loaded with artichokes, tomatoes, olives, feta and a light white wine sauce. Perfect for this summer heat! But I have also had everything from fish with mango salsa to yummy burgers. My vegan friend is always happy too because they always make sure to accommodate her dietary restrictions. She always gets the same thing but she says it's hands down the best salad she has ever had. And as if the food wasn't enough reason to keep coming back... The bartenders are always super friendly and make us feel welcome. TV's are really nice for sports too! We will most likely be making it a part of our football rotation. Looks like they will have a lot of specials and promos going on for the season. Great neighborhood spot!"}
{"text":"Best late night spot! The food is amazing and the staff is  friendly. Best late night prices.  I'm a loyal local."}
{"text":"Agree on the nasty carpet and cigarette smoke but the clam chowder was awesome!  Maybe I was just really hungry.  I ordered the Caverns and it was too sweet so she took it back and got me a Merlot - no fuss.  I heard lots of laughter from a party of locals and the bar was full so they're doing something right.  The salmon looks and smells great!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend came here one Sunday afternoon trying to kill a bit of time. I've seen this place a few times, but never really wanted to come in and try it. My boyfriend we suggested we come here, because he came once and had the nachos and thought they were amazing. He also included a little fun fact: Roseanne Barr was interviewed before and stated that when she's in Vegas she always has to stop by Winchell's because it's her favorite place to be.  My boyfriend and I sat at the bar, so that we could gamble a little. He ordered Fat Tire on tap and I had a virgin pina colada because I'm pregnant. (There are probably a total of 10 beers on tap which is pretty good, I did not catch which ones are offered though).  For lunch, we ordered fried zucchini, nachos with beef, and the grilled cheese sandwich with 3 types of cheese and avocado. The fried zucchini was great! I never knew this vegetable was so tasty, it came with a side of ranch. The nachos were pretty big and they were reasonably tasty but nothing over the top. We had to bring this home, we couldn't finish it with all the food we ordered. And lastly, I didn't quite fancy the grilled cheese sandwich. It was nothing special. I would've preffered making a velveeta grilled sandwich at home; but my boyfriend said he thought it was \"amazing.\" I maybe a little picky...   The staff was all very friendly and timely. I would come back only if my boyfriend wanted."}
{"text":"Food was food; Philly cheesesteak and chili. People friendly, but took a while for someone to cone see us. The problem is the noise; we were there at lunch and the noise was terrible - can't imagine what it would be like at dinner time."}
{"text":"Friendly staff good beer but the food is overpriced and not that good at all in my experience and eating while 4 people are smoking in there makes it worse people should just smoke outside the door is right there and they should bring the food prices down since its not that good"}
{"text":"I like Winchell's and come here for lunch once in a while.  They are a little slow sometimes with the service - once they even forgot about my table completely and we finally had to grab a new waiter. No free meal or discount from that, which we really deserved However, that was a true anomaly (I hope).  In general, though, if I can get back to work in less than 1 1/2 hours, that is pretty good.    The food here is fine for pub fare. I happen to be a grilled cheese sandwich fiend and can vouch for their sandwiches (I always ask for cheddar). They use plenty o'cheese, the way I love it.  Their fries are good, too.  I recommend this place to anyone wanting a simple \"American\" meal with no frills, in a decent atmosphere.  This place is clean, nicely appointed, and the staff are friendly- just a little slow sometimes.  --Allison"}
{"text":"Our favorite hang out! Awesome food with great daily specials! The wrapped fried shrimp, the corned beef sandwich, the blue burger are some of our favorites but pretty much everything is amazing!"}
{"text":"Max S. says that I should stop closing business in Henderson by writing poor reviews on yelp...huh... thus I am writing a fan review of this operation.  We visited Winchell's last evening and the good looking male bartender was funny and gave good service. The other employees were pleasant and helpful as well.  I especially enjoyed the Patty Melt and they had Stella in stock and flowing from the tap. I have been here a number of times and always had a positive experience."}
{"text":"I had 8oz steak it was great. I was not sure there's just bar. But It broke my thinking."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today with my friend for the first time. I ordered Cuvee Salads around noon. I had a bloated stomach, headache and loss of appetite afterward. I skipped dinner since I didn't feel like eating.  Now 11-12 hours later, I ended up vomitting TWICE what I ate for lunch there.  I will probably never come back to Winchell's Pub & Grill again."}
{"text":"Went here on 12/07/10 with some friends. All in all there were 5 of us crammed into one table in the glass smokey room.   Positives: My tortilla soup ($2.50/cup) was off the chain. Open really late. My friend Jen's horrific Thai skewers were taken off the bill.  Negatives:  -Thai skewers were simply what looked like boiled ripped up chicken covered in Mae Ploy sauce, on 4 skewers, served with peanut butter. Ew.  -Everybody was crazy old. The waitress said the people who come in are usually 65+ -Waitress stopped refilling our waters after one refill. -Really random (bad) music.  We were there for 3 hours chatting it up, but I don't think I'd go back unless I was with friends. Their soup was good so yeah, 2 stars."}
{"text":"I don't know why it took so long to write this review. I've been coming here for breakfast since I moved to this part of town. I usually come with my boyfriend and our friends, and everyone loves it. Came in today (Christmas Eve) and it was so busy, yet the service was still very good, and the food was hot and delicious as always. The portion of food is huge, and they are quick to refill coffee and waters. I've been to many breakfast places here in town, but for some reason this is the only place I've found in Vegas that can cook an egg properly. Kids can come too, even though it is connected to a bar."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and they are still great. Always great service and I've never had anything that wasn't delicious. They're not close to me, but I make the drive just for them. Highly recommend the Cuvee salad, chicken scallopini and onion rings."}
{"text":"Exceptionally rude!!!   We were waiting on friends to eat and the hostess assumed and accused us of just coming in to use their bathrooms.    Now I wouldn't eat here if you paid me...."}
{"text":"Since my last post, the staff have gone so far above and beyond to make This our home away from home from home. We come in here at least 2-3 times a week and we are rarely unimpressed by the quality of our food!!"}
{"text":"Nothing like a beer after a long day, I always come for happy hour the bartenders Dan and Tim are the best!  The food is amazing also nothing like 1/2 price apps and pizza. Be careful with the apps the portions are huge! Defiantly get a bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Sherry the bartender is such a nice lady, always making me feel at home when I'm at the bar"}
{"text":"the best coffee shop on eastern  great breakfast try eggs Benedict's  and for lunch great salads and burger"}
{"text":"Went there Monday at 6pm very busy,....only one waitres on duty....It took so long to order get food....This is not her fault......They need more help..We have been coming here since it opened....We eat here a lot....Hope this isn't going to happen again....."}
{"text":"Trying this place even though yelp customers are not giving great reviews. Got tired of driving around to fine breakfast. Sat down to a table that needs to be refinished.  The cleaning fluid used has stripped way the top coat so it feels dirty and sticky all the time. It looks like it's easy to overwhelm the wait staff. There looks to be 2 rooms for dinning and only 4 waitresses and one bus girl. Breakfast was good and the price was reasonable.  Farmer's Skillet was filling."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite restaurants inexpensive and excellent food. Their specials are great and the Penny & Sharon two of the waitress are excellent."}
{"text":"I have ate here many times in the past.  I was very disappointed tonight after ordering Thai Chicken Skewers.  They were made with dark meat chicken that was fatty at the cost of $8.99.  I was charged $3.50 for a very small cup of vegetables.  After the .75 pick up fee and tax it cost a hefty $14.27 for a very disappointing meal.  In this economy I see so many of my favorite restaurants using substandard food and charging more.  Suffice it to say I will be eating home a lot more than I use to."}
{"text":"I made a late night carryout order about 15 minutes before arriving to this place. My oriental chicken salad was fine but my fried zucchini wedges came as slices - when I read wedges on a menu (online) I think of something resembling pickle spears. It was also cold and soggy, like completely cold and soggy. Misorder? Refrigerated? Just completely old."}
{"text":"First time here for breakfast and the food and service are amazing. Was looking for a quick bite but now we will be back to try more of their food. Very happy to have stumble into this place."}
{"text":"Flew into Vegas for the weekend and this was our first official stop for lunch.  It is super close to the airport... I think you can walk there if you wanted to (0.25 miles) but it was convenient since we exited out of the rental car deck and found ourselves on the same street.  I ordered a lunch special burger... 1/2 Angus jalapeno burger with all the toppings... was tasty and filling.  Their \"skinny\" fries are a bit of a mis-nomer since I automatically think of a lower calorie french fry (that tastes like card board) but these are just skinny in shape.  I think I usually see them called shoestring fries.  Servers were friendly and accommodating... especially after I ordered a beer at 10am.... no judgments were hashed out.  I would definitely come here again... especially since this place is open 24hrs.... but I would question my need to come here at 3 or 4am. :)"}
{"text":"This and the other location have close to the right mix.  Good food, music, beer selection and comfort but...  The don't have WiFi.  So I was forced to go to the competition...  Also happy hour is relatively long but it is unclear when it actually is...  In summary, a good place for lunch, but not a place to get any work done..."}
{"text":"This is an easy spot for lunch- very close to the office and good food. Good pub food! Good service!"}
{"text":"This place is disgusting.  First of all it is so filthy it was actually grossing me out to eat there.  I was going along with my friends so I didn't want to say anything the carpet alone was disgusting I didn't even want to walk on it. The waitresses were friendly and it was decorated for Christmas.   I ordered a French dip and I bit into it and I could just tell that the roast beef was old and had a funny taste to it.   Sure enough I was sick all night.  I would never return to this place for as much as people hype about it no thanks"}
{"text":"I'm a frequent traveler to Las Vegas, and Winchell's is always one of my first stops - and not just because it's so conveniently located near the rental car center! I dream of the California burger with house-made chips, and the service is always fast and friendly. They really treat you like family here!"}
{"text":"Since starting work in the area, Winchell's has been a go-to on my lunchtime rotation. So I decided they deserve an upgrade.   The food is always solid and despite the initial glitch in service on my first visit, service is always friendly and extremely efficient. It's a great place to get a quick bite for lunch. I have become absolutely addicted to the veggie pita sandwich. It's the only thing I ever come for. I do eventually have to try something else, but it'll be hard to pull away from my favorite. They have lots of lunch specials that are incredibly reasonably priced and they have a lot of variety daily. The regular menu pricing is also very well-priced and reasonable. My dining companions are also always very pleased with their meal choices as well.   I will continue to keep Winchell's on my lunchtime rotation."}
{"text":"I know it says \"& Grill\" but I never expect too much from a bar as far as food goes.  But this place was surprisingly good!  Great salads as well and nice atmosphere.  Seems to be for the locals which is always good, and was nice to see a good baseball game there, the Indians getting the record in the AL for their win streak."}
{"text":"It's about time I amended this... the place has gotten back to its roots and becomes amazing again.  My partner and I go here about every other weekend for breakfast, and I usually meet my friend for lunch.  The food never disappoints and the portions are HUGE!    All the servers are amazing and work their asses off!  They know everyone and it's almost a no-brainer when ordering sometimes!  So glad to see things back to where they belong!!!! (Happy Dance)"}
