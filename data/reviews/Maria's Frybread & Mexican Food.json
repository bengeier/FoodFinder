{"text":"Deserving of 5 stars the food is unreal & the service is great! Nachos supreme is where it's at! So delicious! The enchiladas are excellent. Prices are reasonable & you get good portion sizes! Service is quick too."}
{"text":"Green chile is delicious! The pozole is always on point! Their chips are soooo good. Large portions, great food, good price! Love this place! Not to mention the staff is ALWAYS so nice and friendly!"}
{"text":"Delicious ! New Yorkers just getting off a flight, grabbed lunch, they were awesome, friendly, good portions, delicious meal. Both my husband and I had burritos. Highly recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and great service. I will definitely be back the next time I am in town. Shredded chicken burrito combo and flat bread for desert. Five stars all the way."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food. I found this on yelp while traveling in Phoenix.  I had the chicken enchilada combo with both the very tasty red adobo sauce and the slightly more spicy green sauce. I would go back there anytime.  Very friendly and caring staff, and a very tasty value for your dollar. Thank you Yelpers and keep up the good work Maria's!"}
{"text":"First time here and I am absolutely blown away by the service and food here. They let you taste anyting before you order, extremely friendly, know their product well, and produce absolutely amazing food. Best fry bread in Phoenix paired perfectly with Mexican food."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a hankering for frybread, but when we tried to visit another place, it was rained out and was closed. With our craving unsatisfied, we looked around for another frybread place and found Maria's Frybread & Mexican Food. We ordered the frybread taco from the menu. While we were waiting for our food, we were given tortilla chips with three different salsas: a mild green salsa, a \"medium\" green salsa, and a habañero red salsa, which was the \"hottest.\" When we tasted the three, we actually found the medium green salsa the hottest. My husband and I eat a lot of spicy foods, and I know that I have built up a tolerance to red chilies, so although the habañero red salsa was pretty hot, the medium green salsa was actually hotter for me.

After our frybread tacos came out, I used the green salsa to flavor my frybread. It made it spicy in a good way. Although it was a little greasy, I liked the flavors of the taco. My husband enjoyed his, too. If we are back in Phoenix, we will probably try Maria's again."}
{"text":"Carne asada fry bread taco!!!  Just realized this place exists, so close to home. Fresh, delicious,  fast, friendly staff:)  Says it all!!!"}
{"text":"Small hole in the wall place went here while on vacation and it was great ce with 7 people and everyone liked their food will come back"}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is delicious! The ambiance and service was amazing. One of my new favorite places!"}
{"text":"Damn.  Now that's a good fry bread taco.  Couldn't decide red or green so  he gave me a sample of both.  Amazing green was selected as it had the perfect heat.  Fry bread was crisp and the piled high toppings were fresh.  Service is friendly and very prompt. This just hit my favorites list!!"}
{"text":"Awesome.  I had the fry bread with beans, cheese and chorizo.  I will definitely be back.  Good service and food was excellent!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! All the food ive tried has been fresh and delicious. Maria's is family owned and operated I have been here a few times for lunch and have had all good experiences they run this place well!! Always nice and friendly. I've tried green chilli sopapilla, red beef enchiladas both are amazing! I'm so excited to try their pasole (served daily)!"}
{"text":"Awesome!!! It's definitely a hole in the wall type place and could be over looked but so glad I tried this place out. The chips were amazing! The salsa, all three types had a lot of flavor. I personally loved the green salsa. I ordered the fried taco. It was taste, so much flavor and came put fresh. The service was amazing, quick, friendly and nice. I would absolutely go back to this place."}
{"text":"Good food, inexpensive, super nice people working there. Did it blow me away? Sadly no, but still worth a stop"}
{"text":"The service was excellent including the food. Definitely a satisfied tummy here, but the service made a lasting classy taste. Great job, Thank You!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem. It's clean. The service is great. The food is delicious.  Our family has been there several times. We had the sopapillas/fry bread  with beans and cheese. It's a generous portion and the beans are made from scratch.  Just like my moms frijoles. The menudo is just tasty. There's equal amounts of hominy and tripe and the broth is delicious. What makes this establishment special, it's  family owned and it shows on the quality  of the food, service, and are exceptionally nice people."}
{"text":"After seeing all of the reviews on Yelp, I decided to stop and try it out.  This was the first time that I had fry bread and I thought that it was great!  The portion was too large for me, I could have easily split one with someone else.  The people that run the place were very nice and attentive!

I love little family run businesses like this, keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The staff is incredibly sweet and thoughtful, and so accommodating! Not to mention the food is soooo good! I've been here multiple times within just a few weeks of discovering it. The prices are great, and the sopapillas are of course my favorite on the menu. New favorite spot for sure!! Hands down, amazing."}
{"text":"I was looking for real Mexican food and I found it. The food was great and the customer service was excellent. I had the number 11, which was the carne asada burrito it was one of tbe best I have ever had. The price was unbelievable for the meal I had."}
{"text":"Stopped by late Saturday for some sopaipillas. The staff was incredibly nice and attentive, and the restaurant very clean. Excellent sopaipillas, too!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"very cheap meat there was a lot of fat in my dish & the chicken was very very dry.
i couldn't eat them.
never again!"}
{"text":"First timer, food came out fast. Flatbread taco was surprising but delicious. salsas were on point, and the chips were good as well. Would recommend to a friend"}
{"text":"Was referred to this place by a close friend...the trip was well worth the drive..cozy place with great food and excellent service...I would rate as my new favorite mexican food restaurant in the phoenix valley...this is a place that is a must visit if you're a fan of great mexican food..."}
{"text":"Wow! This might be my new favorite low key Mexican restaurant, with outstanding fry bread to boot. I got tacos and they were made with fresh tortillas and savory flavorful shredded beef. My husband got fry bread with green chili, beans etc. The fry bread itself had the most flavor I've ever tasted in fry bread. They served with fresh made tortilla chips and wonderful salsa. I can't wait to go back! Next time I'm getting my own fry bread. 

Also worth noting, the guys behind the counter were incredibly nice. They helped explain the menu choices, made recommendations when asked and checked on us 2 or 3 times while we ate. It is fast-food type restaurant, but served with real plates/silverware and attentive service, even though the place was full. 

Try it out. You will be glad!"}
{"text":"I came to the area for vacation back in August and with all the great reviews we had to check this place out! Of course we ordered the fry bread which was great and different from anything I've tried on the east coast. We also ordered the enchiladas which were hands down the best enchiladas I've ever had! The red sauce was perfect. They were simple but had great flavor I would definitely recommend the enchiladas. Wish I could buy the enchilada sauce to take home, it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Great fry bread! The ladies at the counter were very nice. Wish it was closer so I could check out more from the menu but I will be back when near the area."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Had the frybread and the bread and chile were truly authentic. Incredible staff. So nice and friendly. I understand all the 5 star reviews. Great place."}
{"text":"This is my go to for menudo! It's not the fattiest menudo (which I like). Great balance of spices. Also, the staff is super friendly!"}
{"text":"food was great great customer service.  The green chill was the bomb and for a $1 more you get a bigger fry bread"}
{"text":"I took a trip to Sedona and decided to stay in Phoenix on my way back home. The one thing I knew is I wanted to try some authentic fry bread. We got the carne asada fry bread and a plain which we added cinnamon sugar and honey. Got breakfast burritos for the kids. Everything was delicious and the customer service was amazing. Super friendly and helpful. They made accommodations to make something our picky 3 year old would eat. They had great local recommendation and gave us samples of some of their other meat sauces. If we were locals we would be regulars. Great people and great food. Please support them!"}
{"text":"Just amazing. Lightening fat, super friendly service. I had the beef chimichanga and a sopapilla. Huge portions, delicious food. If I lived here, I'd be an instant regular!"}
{"text":"Great food.   Super friendly staff.   Very quick service.   Some of the best chips ever."}
{"text":"I don't think the pictures really do this place justice. The fry bread/sopapilla totally hit the spot after a morning of hiking. And the tamales were a 12--the corn and fillings were perfect. The burrito grande was way too grande for us, but amazing in its own right--lol it felt like it was stuffed with 1//4 chicken! Don't forget to wash it down with horchata. Thanks for a great meal :)"}
{"text":"So today my wife and I went to eat at one of are favorite restaurant which was \" two hippie \"  and as we walk in we noticed that it was now a Mexican and fry bread restaurant it was very disappointing and I wanted to leave but my wife insisted on staying. And I'm glad we did we both had the green Chile fry bread tacos it was so good and tasty and the portions were just right I will strongly recommended this place. It was so good I wish I could give then more star."}
{"text":"Was visiting my friend for a few days in Scottsdale and stumbled across Maria's searching Yelp! for places to eat. D E L I C I O U S! No complaints here on \"too much toppings\" as one reviewer mentioned. Simple fix for that? You scoop it off with a tortilla chip and enjoy! We also tried their menudo which was better than what I had anticipated. To quench our thirst, we had some horchata which I can tell was homemade and not out of some premixed drink dispenser. We ordered plain Indian fry bread with honey and powdered sugar as dessert. It was oh so satisfying. The young man at the window was very nice to us (we told him we'd never been there before) and he let us sample some red and green chile. The green chile was very tasty and what we chose to have with our fry bread. Great customer courtesy and service, food was delicious, and they're quick (we went through the drive-thru). I recommend you give it a whirl if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Stopped by to try the fry bread. The food was really good and the service was over the top. They were eager to please and offered samples of a variety of foods. Don't pass up the dessert - fry bread with honey, cinnamon and powdered sugar. That was our favorite!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Service was serious. These people want you to like their food, want to wait on you, and have a good experience while at their restaurant. Very good and tender red Chile. Really good cheese. The fry bread is great and so are the tortillas they use the make burritos. Fresh is all I can think of. Went there yesterday, went back today, may go back tomorrow. There are too many terrible places out there so I have to give these people 5 stars and they try hard and deserve it. Thank You"}
{"text":"Great spot to eat. No fluff, but the food is great, and prices are right. Their hottest hot sauce is just that, HOT!!  Recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Great enchiladas. Homemade chips and salsa. Full menu available at breakfast. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"This is a clean,  small/medium sized dine in with an extremely friendly service.  I loved everything about this joint! The food was amazing,  you definitely have to try the taco Frybread  which is what they're known for.  It's similar to an elephant ear that is soft and crunchy with taco toppings on top. It's a must if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"I was very hungry and really excited to try this place after reading all the reviews. So I stopped in to get some food for my employee and myself. I asked for 5 of the same item all without beans. I get to work only to find out that there are beans in all of them. Pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"Great green chili burrito lunch! Stopped by during a recent business trip and it was great! Highly recommended. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Marias is amazing. Good prices, big portions, tasty food, good service. I usually get the green chili fry bread, but most things on the menu are great. I've been coming here once a week and haven't had a bad experience. Keep it up Maria's!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry but I really don't understand what all of the fuss is about. $9 for their signature dish? It was okay but not worth $9. I couldn't believe it cost me $28 total for two people. For being a one dollar sign, five star restaurant, I thought it was highly overrated and overpriced. Don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Some of the best food in town. The green chili sopapilla is amazing. Jose was very friendly and the shop was very clean. I will come back again and again."}
{"text":"Great little family restaurant.  Customer service and food were amazing.  They truly go the extra mile with picky customers.  My daughter and I had the fry bread tacos.  Everything was super fresh and tasty.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Let me
Just say we stumbled in on this restaurant and we are so glad we did. The service is amAzing . They really take good care of you and are top of things. They are so nice . The food is beyond amazing , cheese enchiladas are on point . Salsa is sooo good, the tostadas are great . So glad we found this place !!"}
{"text":"Not a lot of seating... but they have a drive-thru.  Came here with a group-of-6 from work... and wow the food was good!  Friendly, very fast, huge portions. Overall, a great experience.  I'll start making this a regular lunch stop from now on."}
{"text":"This little place was different from your usual albertos, jilabertos or any of the other bertos out there.  First off the menu was smaller than most of those types of places.  They have a small seating area outside, another small seating area in front of the counter where you order.  And a third in the back. We ordered a green chili crisp, which was like an open quesadilla and man that chili was hot.  Great flavor, but hot.  I had the red chili fry bread taco.  The red chili had great flavor and was not as hot as the green.  The Taco had cheese with a little lettuce and tomato on the side.  My wife had the open fry bread taco with shredded beef.  The beef had perfect seasoning, and the taco had beans with lettuce tomato and cheese.  After seeing hers I would have ordered open also as even though mine was closed tt was so sloppy I had to eat it with a fork anyways.  As I had not been here before I ordered a side of rice and beans.  The beans were quite tasty,though the rice was a little bland.   The chips that came with the food were different than ordinary chips, they were a little puffy with a nice crisp.  There were three salsas that varied in flavor but all were good.   They place is called Maria's Mexican food and fry bread for a good reason, get the fry bread you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service.  Had the red menudo and the shredded beef fry bread taco.  All so good!"}
{"text":"We've been to 2 other fried bread places in Phoenix. This one was the best, so far. The service was great and vey friendly.  We got our food in no time at all. This place has set the bar for Indian fried bread in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Outstanding, friendly, quick service. Great food-green Chile, pozole.  Clean. Definitely a new stop on my list when driving through the area."}
{"text":"My new favorite place! love the frybread with red chili and cheese."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food, owner was very nice. Extremely clean, family takes alot of pride in their business and it shows! Alot of care taken in the restaurant and the food is delicious! Great yelp discovery!"}
{"text":"It was pretty bland.  The sauce they put on the chicken fry bread made it get soggy.  I would maybe order their dessert fry bread, but I wouldn't order dinner/lunch there again.
People were nice though."}
{"text":"Traveling for work, seen this come up on Yelp after I couldn't find this other Mexican restaurant. Walked in was instantly greeted. Told the guy at the counter it was my first time in and was looking for recommendations. He immediately said try one of the frybreads and told me some of the popular ones. I went with the green chile beef frybread and a glass bottle of coke. This is probably hands down the best Mexican food I've ever had. So glad i found this place, will definitely come to this place again if I come thru Phoenix again."}
{"text":"The breakfast burrito was excellent. They make a mean green chili. The service was fantastic, the staff are very grateful and it shows!"}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a late lunch - the food here is fantastic, the people are super friendly - 5 stars indeed!"}
{"text":"What a find! The staff is very friendly and the food comes out fast! The fry bread taco was simply amazing. The shredded meat was tasty, the beans were perfectly seasoned and the salsas topped it off perfectly. I left there will honey on my shirt, and honey it was worth it. If you haven't tried this place yet - it is TIME."}
{"text":"Stopped in with a buddy while on the road. The from of the place has a couple of tables but there is seating in the back and outside. We ordered at the counter a very friendly guy who took the time to explain their menu which is huge. After some suggestions I settled on the chicken enchiladas with green chile. Holy crap this could have been the best Mexican food I have ever had. For about $13 I was stuffed and I'm a big guy. I only wish they had a location where I live but I will be checking in next time I come to Phoenix. They also have a drive through that was cranking the hole time we were there. Awesome place!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, good affordable food. We had tacos on fry bread, a delicious and different take on an old standard.  Shredded chicken had no spice heat at all (good news for some) and three choices of sauce to add heat to taste."}
{"text":"Delicious. Great portions. My friend and I were impressed with the flavor and salsas. Super helpful staff"}
{"text":"Great new restaurant in a tough to spot location. Look for a bright yellow painted van in the front of the parking lot. 

Live nearby and have stopped twice now. The menu is shorter than most people expect from a Mexican-type spot, but to me that's a the sign of a good restaurateur: do what you know, only what you know, and do it right. Maria's does that. Food both times was absolutely delish. 

On top of good food, this really is a family owned AND operated business by people who couldn't be nicer or more accommodating. 

So do yourself a favor and find the yellow van. 

Update: I have made this one of my go-to spots - a couple of stops per week for breakfast burritos and one a week or every other week for lunch / dinner -  and tried a number of items. Everything has been absolutely delish. Green chile fry bread is off the charts. Breakfast burritos are huge and very good. 

Give them a try. They're in kinda a tough location (hard to see fm the road), but this is absolutely one of those family joints worth supporting and keeping in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I love their red chile enchiladas! They are very tasty along with the beans and rice. I usually use the drive-thru and they are always friendly and appreciate your business. I'm glad there is a good Mexican food restaurant near my home."}
{"text":"Today I am having fry bread taco and a cinnamon sugar fry bread plus the service is all good"}
{"text":"The number 7 green chili chimichanga was amazingly delicious and the green salsa for the chips i have to admit was a bit spicy yet I still wanted more man I don't know where they have been my whole life it's AMAZING!!!!"}
{"text":"found this place on accident and it was a great place to eat friendly service and great food menudo and pozole were great i definitely recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"If you're hungry and you're in the area there is no reason not to stop at Maria's! I wish I lived closer."}
{"text":"This restaurant was surprisingly fantastic! It was clean, the customer service was phenomenal, and the food was perfect. They had at least 4 regular customers come in while we were there, they new each of their orders by heart. Will definitely return and bring friends!"}
{"text":"YUM! I spent $14 here and got a massive carne asada fry bread taco and the dessert sopapilla. Everything was fast, fresh, and delicious."}
{"text":"They messed up my order and when I called to tell them the guy said implied that I was wrong. I had ordered a green chili fry bread taco and a bean and cheese burrito but when I got home it was only a bean and cheese burrito and a bean and cheese taco. So out of frustration I called to let them know they made a mistake and the guy who answered the phone said he asked the owner who made the taco and she says she definitely put green chili rather than making it right. Which leads me here. Very poor customer service and not very good for the price."}
{"text":"Fantastic Mexican food with very friendly service.  Nice little spot for lunch while on vacation"}
{"text":"Best homemade food! Posole is my favorite! Tamales are bomb! Super yummy! Still gotta try the fry bread but hooked on the posole!"}
{"text":"Delicious fry bread, but even better was the friendly service.  When they learned it was our first time we were brought samples.  I went with the red chile sauce on top.  At the end of my meal they even brought me a sweet fry bread to try! Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Good food and equal customer service. I really enjoyed the undivided attention and detailed craftsmanship in their menu. Thank you Maria's Frybread!"}
{"text":"Forget the frybread and try the tamales! The tamales were amazing, probably the best I've had. They have a few different types each day and we got a vegetarian one and green chile chicken one. Both were to die for and five stars for those. TBH though, I wasn't a fan of the sweet frybread here ... it was very thin and drowned in the toppings. Maybe better as a taco. But those were a two star. Everything was very expensive ($6+ for the frybreads). Then the people weren't very friendly, so the inconsistencies in everything brought me to my 3 stars. Just come and get a tamale and you'll leave happy!"}
{"text":"The food was taste but they only put 3 little pieces of meat in my tostada, it was mostly beans."}
{"text":"Real food in a city of generic chains. Had the green chili beef today. Excellent! Have to come back for the frybread and burritos. Extra credit to the welcoming family hosts. Thank you Yelp!"}
{"text":"The fry bread is a must!  
The food was delicious and fast!  The staff was great - polite, checked on us regularly and offered suggestions.  A must!"}
{"text":"Oh frybread, how I Iove you so! Drop what you are doing and get down here!  I went in for some frybread and Ieft not only full in my stomach, but full in my heart.  Iove supporting families who are doing what they love and are really good at it too!  The food was delicious and the owners were amazing - they were just as concerned with my 10 month old sons happiness as they were mine!  I watched return customer after return customer place their order and the owner remembered not only what they ordered but how they ordered it. If that doesn't get you all warm and fuzzy, I don't know what will! OMG! I almost forgot to mention the tomatillo salsa!  If it would be socially acceptable to bathe in, then count me in! Only somewhat joking! 

But seriously, the place was very quaint, the food was delicious, the service was fast and the ambiance was relaxing.  If you are in a rush, don't forget there is a drive-thru! They are a bit of a hidden gem, so as another reviewer mentioned, look for the yellow van in the front of the parking lot and it is located behind the Pet Club.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican food in a small, walk-up restaurant with a few tables. Fry bread is delish!"}
{"text":"My sister called me and asked if I wanted a taco.  Sure, thinking it'd be from a taco pack from a chain.  A bad taco is better than no taco, right?

I was floored with what she brought me.  A green chili frybread taco, overflowing with cheese.  Any establishment who is so gracious with the cheese automatically gets over three stars.  But the green chili sealed the 5 star deal.  

I can't rave enough.  It's heavenly!  You can taste the homemade love in all elements!  

And the cheese!!  They are amazing!"}
{"text":"Service was awesome and the restaurant was very clean. The chile verse burro was my favorites I am not a big fry bread fan. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I hate to do it but 1 star for Maria's frybread. Ordered the open faced fry bread taco and it was a total disappointment. I grew up eating frybread and was super excited about the reviews saying it was the best fry bread in town. First of all it came out really quick like the frybread was already made and not cooked to order which is fine if you can make bomb ass fry bread you can get away with it. Bread was cold and dry like crackers. The bread is the foundation of the taco when it comes to frybread tacos. You can have the best toppings on it but if your fry bread comes out blah you're going to have a blah fry bread taco. Gave 1 extra star because staff was friendly and there was good energy in the place. Toppings were good too but again the bread is where it's at."}
{"text":"The green chili fry bread was amazing and Carlos is awesome!  My only regret was I ate so much fry bread I barely had room for the complimentary pozole.  Don't worry, I packed that bad boy up to go.  Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"So good. Really good frybread. Light and fluffy. Green chili meat set it off. So dang good."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Mexican food place in Phoenix! Not only is the food amazing and authentic the restaurant is very clean and has a grade A rating. The two gentlemen that own the place are the sweetest guys and their service is exceptional. I have been in a few times and they remember me every time. The service is fast and quality. I would recommend the green chili fry bread! Looking forward to trying out more of their menu. Definitely a go-to place even if you don't live in the area!"}
{"text":"Maria's frybread was first on our food adventure and it definitely did not disappoint. A group of 6 of us went in to order only one fried bread taco, which is probably odd. So when the owners asked we told them we are on a good adventure and we were going to try about 6 different restaurants today. 

The customer service hands down is AMAZING! 
- they did not get annoyed that our group of 6 only order 1 item
- they brought us out samples of their sauces
- they gave us a free fried dessert bread to try and oh myyy it was delicious! 

Have to say that the dessert bread was my favorite! You can add your own honey, cinnamon sugar, or powder sugar. 

This place went above and beyond so I definitely would be back when I have a chance!"}
{"text":"I want to start by saying that these are the nicest and friendliest people.  Their place is super clean and neat.  
Having said that,  the food is average at best.  The burrito was large but the taste was not there.  Food was lacking in salt and seasoning.  
The fry bread with beef, beans and cheese was super large but again, not tasty at all.  I added salt and it still did nothing for the dish so we both packed the food almost intact.  That was a $20 hit and no dinner. 

The fry bread itself was tasty but after the beans and the cheese on top (not melted just Kroger shredded cheese on top), the fry bread became limp.  The beef tasted cooked, not grilled as there was no char on it.  Not flavorful at all.  Both dishes were disappointments.  
I see all the 5 star ratings.  That just means that people don't know flavors or don't cook themselves or don't know what it's really supposed to taste like.   
I wish them continue luck as they clearly have a following but it won't be me."}
{"text":"This place is so good!!!  We had the Pozole and the sopaipilla for breakfast. It was all so flavorful and authentic.  We also had a side of beans and the green chile. It was one of the best things we have had in a while. 

Their service was also spectacular. They made you feel at home and came by to make sure you loved the food. 

Love this place. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been here more than a few times and ordered several things off the menu and not once have I've been disappointed with the food. This small restaurant offers a huge flavor in their delicious food. I've had a sopapilla  with red chili, and green burro with cheese. Also, the enchiladas with red sauce are great!

Customer service is amazing, 5 stars itself. Very kind, and time efficient.

You'll be glad you have them a try. 
 Update: the Pozole is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this spot while I was visiting friends in Phoenix and I am still dreaming about it a week later! I had lived in Mexico on a travel study and this stuff is the real deal! Everything was so fresh and we were served our food seconds after we sat at our table! I am a vegetarian and my mom and I are both pretty sensitive to spicy foods, but everything we ordered was still jam-packed with flavor and the man at the front desk (wish I got his name ) was insanely helpful to us when we were deciding what to order, I had the frybread without meat and my mom had the shredded beef. I also highly recommend ordering the Jamaica juice if you have a sweet tooth! We also got an order of the plain sopapillas to-go because we were too full and I really wish I was able to enjoy them fresh from the fryer because they were still very tasty when we got home, but I can only imagine how good they would be right away!"}
{"text":"Great find.  

Food is awesome.

Serice was fast, and the staff is courteous.

The restaurant is very clean and neat.  

Food that was served looked like the menu, that I ordered from.  I appreciate how they take pride in their craft.

If I lived here I would come back more often.
Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. The service was impeccable - so nice! The food was flavorful. The portions were big sizes and the sauces were all different and loved them all. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food was awesome...green chile fry bread!  Even better was the service, which was incredible for such a small operation. The Yelp score brought us in...did not disappoint."}
{"text":"All the great reviews are right. I showed up a few minutes before closing and the service was very friendly and courteous, unlike many restaurants that rush you out. The chili verde frybread was spot on; very flavorful, and the meat had an excellent texture. I will have a tough time not eating here every night while I'm in town."}
{"text":"Not only does this place have unique delicious food, it also has amazing costumer service. I took my boyfriend here for the first time today and he too mentioned the amazing service. I recommend this place to anyone and everyone! If you're in the Phoenix area check out the fry breads and of course the desserts!"}
{"text":"I've been coming coming here for a few years every time I am in Phoenix area. Amazingly good Mexican food and Fry bread. I love their shredded beef tacos and the potions are enough to share."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!

I've been meaning to come here since I moved to the area and glad I finally made it.

One word. GO

I ordered the Ground Beef FryBread Taco and it was the best thing I have eaten in a long time. Great portion size, flavor, and presentation. Comes with chips and salsa too.

The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. I will be back many times. Sorry, too busy eating to take a pic :)"}
{"text":"Oh, my gosh how I love this place. I've always only gotten their frybread. It's amazing. I've done sweet & savory options. They are a ton of food. Unless you have a huge appetite, I'd recommend splitting yours with someone.

They have a drive thru and service is always fast & super friendly. Most definitely go here & get some frybread. You will not regret it, well unless you eat too much. If you don't like it, you're nuts."}
{"text":"Really good food. The frybread was awesome. Also got to try the nachos supreme. It was good, not ur typical fast Mexican food nachos, but they serve it in a tortilla bowl and that was so freaking delicious. The people that work there are awesome. They brought out chips and 3 different kinds of salsa. I had ordered a sopapilla too and he had the courtesy to ask if they should hold it and bring it later. And he was on it. Almost as soon as we were done he brought a piping hot sopapilla out with water. It may look like some generic Mexican place, but this place goes way above and beyond anything u will see there. What an awesome spot. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Maria's is such a quiant place filled with yummy food!!! My boyfriend and I had the frybread, their best seller, and it was delicious and the bread was fluffy and soft. Highly recommend the fresh juice and the $1 paletas, but the paletas are a cash only. The staff is super friendly and if you have any questions or want to try something new they will direct you in the right directions. Also a bonus they have a drive through which is open later than their lobby hours!!!"}
{"text":"This is the place to visit if you want delicious food! The people were kind, helpful and treat you like family. We had one green Chile and the red Chile fry bread and a plain one for dessert,  yummy and  tasty!  I highly recommend lunch or dinner here!!"}
{"text":"Really well flavored posole with a deep rich base. Bean tostada was excellent with the red house salsa, carne asada fry bread was amazing and the red chili burrito was rock solid. Amazing find on a quiet Sunday, the whole family was there helping and it was a nice experience."}
{"text":"Super hungry and looking for something to eat, I came across this little gem. I had my family with me so we all ordered something different. I went with the green chili chimichanga. The green chili was delicious, tasty and spicy enough for me! Everyone else loved their food as well. I will definitely be coming back :)

Other food: carne asada fries, quesadilla and the #1...all very good.

Only thing missing was my rice and beans but the chimi itself made up for it.

Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We are in town visiting the Great-Grandparents and watching the Oregon Ducks get ready to play in the NCAA Final Four.  After a fun day at The University of Phoenix Stadium we used Yelp to pick our late lunch/early dinner.  Based on the 5-Star rating, we selected to drive to Maria's Frybread & Mexican Restaurant.

First, let me say that the staff (all of them) were 6 star good! I see why the ratings are all so high! The place was clean and we'll stocked, a well run restaurant.

The food used good, quality ingredients AND the taste was just average. By average, I would visit this place again if it were back home.  But, I would not drive out of my way on vacation again.  This is a solid/basic Mexican fast food Mexican restaurant (3 stars) with excellent, friendly and attentive customer service (6 stars), overall 4.5."}
{"text":"Delicious!I We live in Tucson, AZ and have a pretty good idea of great Mexican food. This food is made with  love!"}
{"text":"Excellent New Mexican food. Service was incredibly  friendly. A family run business you should support! 
Food was excellent and the sauces just right. Thank you."}
{"text":"Wow! Maria's is excellent. Just moved to neighborhood and tried Maria's day 1. Clean and cute shop with nice shaded picnic tables out out front. On their recommendation tried the green chili fry bread and loved it. Nice people as well"}
{"text":"Driving by and Saw's the sign for Maria's Fry Bread. Was in the mood for a burger but that all changed when I saw the sign. I don't eat Fry bread frequently but this spot is my favorite. I have tried a couple of other Fry bread restaurants and have not returned. Maria's will be a regular stopping spot for me."}
{"text":"Super good. Very different then any Mexican food I've ever had. We were a party of 4 and we're well fed afterwards. It was delicious.
Really ask the host what will blow your mind and quench your thirst with Jamaica tea. 

It's fantastic."}
{"text":"Agree with my fellow Yelpers that this place is a winner. We were bummed out when the Fry Bread House east closed with their delicious fry bread tacos. The fry bread at Maria's is just as good and they have good Mexican food as a plus. Be back soon!"}
{"text":"I had to find some Mexican food while in Phoenix and Maria's Frybread did not disappoint! I got the green chile beef frybread and it really hit the spot. Chunks of beef in a green chili sauce that was perfectly spiced so that you knew it was there but not overpowering, served over a crispy sopapilla and topped with lettuce, cheese and tomato. To top it off, they served it with a side of house-made chips and a selection of salsas. My only regret is not being able to try the enchiladas or the tacos, or the dessert sopapillas.  Employees were very friendly and answered all my questions about how the beef and green chile sauce was prepared."}
{"text":"Expected so much more with such a high Yelp rating. 

The frybread is the #1 thing advertised here, its in the name, the window and a big yellow van next to a busy street but my frybread was drowned in so many ingredients that I couldn't fully taste or appreciate it. I got the red chile frybread with beans, lettuce, onions, & cheese and it all overpowered the bread. The size of the plate was nice but I couldn't see my frybread at all, let alone taste it under the mountain of toppings. Its a shame because I was really looking forward to coming here. My girlfriend got a simple frybread with just beans and cheese and she too felt that hers was over-topped. Don't get me wrong the taste of my chile was good and everything else tasted like it should have but we weren't blown away like all the other reviewers were."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food in town... yelped and can came here for lunch... 
taste just awesome. 
Service great.
Very clean place. 
People amazing. 
Wow enchilada sauce were just pure heaven. 
Everything amazing."}
{"text":"Green chili beef had waaaay too much flour in sauce.  Couldn't even eat a quarter if it.  Defeated spiciness of green chili.  Few teeny chunks of tough beef.  Bread was crispy.  Drank my Coke and left most of $12 lunch.  Service prompt, nice and friendly, the Coke was cold and they had cup with ice.  Will try Fry Bread House next time I crave fry bread."}
{"text":"Walked from Crowne Plaza to Los Jarittos, only to find them closed.  So took a Lyft to Maria's and was well rewarded.  Great food, great service, and super friendly.  Ordered chorizo and eggs, side of beans, and machaca, all served with a thin frybread.  Outstanding!"}
{"text":"A total guilty pleasure and worth every calorie.  I feel like I'm a guest at a friend's nana's house!  Home made and delicious! Generous portions.  A gem to find!"}
{"text":"Place was very good. Haven't had decent frybread in a while. The prices are very good when compared to the portion you receive. Everything was made in house and I don't have any complaints. Great food!! I'll be back.."}
{"text":"It was good. But my dish came swimming in sauce and there were a total of 6 little pieces of beef inside, so lost one star for that but it was a tasty sauce...I would come back but to try something else. I love their big Mexican Coke!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I saw this spot featured on Yelp, and the reviews did not disappoint. I'm a huge fan of frybread, and I've had some trouble finding a good place to get it in Phoenix. They offered a variety of different Mexican dishes, and I decided to try their red chili beef frybread. It was delicious! The dish is huge, and is covered in red chili beef, beans, lettuce, cheese, and tomatoes. They also serve tasty tortilla chips, and have three different hot sauces to choose from. It was about $7.50 and super filling. This combined with their horchata was perfect.

The workers were very friendly and welcoming. If this place were closer to Ahwatukee, I'd be coming here all the time. I'd definitely recommend this place if you're looking for some top quality Mexican food and great service."}
{"text":"Great food at a very reasonable price. The fry bread is very light and delicious-definitely try this when visiting. The staff was really friendly and everything we had was excellent."}
{"text":"Based on yelp reviews, I made a point to get to Maria's fry bread for lunch.  The restaurant is small and unassuming. However, the woman working behind the counter was charming and helpful. Based on her recommendation, I ordered the green chili shredded beef fry bread. With the beans, lettuce, tomatoes, and cheese on top, the fry bread was almost enough for two people. I was keeping the spice level low so I used the mild red salsa.  The whole combination was delicious. I switched between the fry bread and the chips as a vehicle for the meat, beans, etc. I couldn't finish it, but it was so good, I wish I could have!"}
{"text":"First time coming here after a recommendation from my sister. It is some of the best Mexican Food in the area! Great prices, generous portions, friendly staff. If you are having problems finding it it just s behind the Pet Cub. Another plus is they have a drive through for easy take out!!!!! I got the fry bread with steak and it was perfect, not greasy or oily but perfectly crispy!
If you are in the area it is a defiant must!!!!!"}
{"text":"In AZ for a couple of days and one of the things on my list to do was try some frybread and try some authentic Mexican food. I killed two birds with one stone coming to this place. Now, I am a fan!

Service was excellent and the food was, too. Total dive. I got the carne asada and ground beef taco just to try. Both were good. My friends each got a red chile frybread. They gave me some and it was so good I almost didn't give them their food back! They give a lot of food, too. And leftovers are just as tasty. Everything re-heats well.

I washed everything down with something from heaven that I never had before: an hibiscus juice. The waitress said that it cleanses the body. It is almost up there with getting baptized!"}
{"text":"Easy to find, with quick service and excellent food. There is limited indoor seating.  You can grab a small table for two, but it will not work well for a large group. It's a great place to grab and go.  They have plenty of the expected options, but order what they are known for.  The fry bread should be your first order."}
{"text":"Friendly Staff. Family owned restaurant. Excellent breakfast & lunch menu. I eat here every Monday morning with my friend, we love it :)"}
{"text":"This ain't filibertos that's for sure. I don't know if the food is authentic but it's definitely very good. Person at the counter was very friendly and I got my food pretty fast. This is a small place so make sure it ain't packed if your bringing the whole family. They have outside seating too"}
{"text":"Good flavors on the pozole and menudo. Nice and clean indoor and outdoor eating area. Service was super FAST and friendly. Prices are very reasonable and good portions. They also have Drive Thru window for to go orders. Definitely  looking forward to coming back. SALSA and chips given at the beginning of meal are super delicious!! 

Check it out !! :)"}
{"text":"Tried the restaurant  . Only five star that I have seen on yelp that has over 50 reviews.  This place sells both Indian Fry bread and Mexican  food. They have a large menu. Tried their Indiana fried bread with Green chili. The food was  way too salty and the meat was crunchy.the fried bread was not light and fluffy . Also had their Navajo taco. Again it was too salty.  Chorizo  and egg was not tasty. Options were decent. And staff friendly not sure how this place could be rated 5 strs6"}
{"text":"The food and service at this restaurant was great. Went there after a round of golf , and was so impressed I took my wife there for dinner. Will be returning."}
{"text":"Maria's sits hidden behind pet club in a space that used to occupy the two hippies burger joint. There are a 7 small tables inside and 2 picnic benches outside and a drive through on the outside. The space is small, but clean and they had a lot of drive thru business going on when I visited. I ordered the carne asada fry bread taco and it was delicious. The fry bread was well good, the beans were good, the carne asada was quality steak with a good grill flavor. This isn't fancy good, but it is very good food. If you like fry bread this is your place."}
{"text":"All the 5 star reviews are well deserved. Stopped in here for the first time and the service was amazing. The guy behind he counter was super helpful. When he found out it was our first time in he explained some of the different dishes and even made some recommendations. While we waited for our  to go order he asked if we liked Menudo or Pasole and brought us out a sample of each. Glad he did because we ended up taking a Pasole to go after trying it. I'm sure I'll be back and I'd definitely recommend it for not just the frye bread but their other food as well."}
{"text":"This place was a hole in the wall but those places are the best. The staff were so friendly and helpful and the food was delish,"}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite place to eat when I have to come to AZ. The service is exceptional and the food is like nothing you have tasted before. There fry bread is absolutely amazing.  If you are looking for delicious food this is your place!!"}
{"text":"They don't have a kids menu and won't do kids portion for sides. If you don't eat beef it's not a good choice either and there was a cockroach that ran under our table. They didn't offer a discount and came and smashed it right in front of us. Hearing the exoskeleton smash makes me want to vomit. So disappointed ."}
{"text":"To the people that have given this restaurant less than five stars it is obvious you don't know what good food is. And wow the customer service is amazing."}
{"text":"Okayyyyyy, now I know why this lovely place has such great reviews on Yelp! The second we walked in, we were greeted with big smiles and had the entire menu explained to us since we were first-timers! We even got to sample the red and green chili beef so that we could decide which one we wanted on our frybread! My husband and I both chose the red chili - it was SO delicious! The frybread was packed with beans, red chili beef, cheese, tomatoes, and lettuce. They serve fresh chips and homemade salsas {mild, medium, and hot} on the side as well. I highly recommend dining in because their service is so friendly and sure to brighten your day! It was like they read our minds with water refills, and everything. I'm so excited this amazing place is in the neighborhood, we'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic little gem! I've only been here twice, but I must say that the fry bread with green chile is absolutely incredible. Delicious, affordable, and definitely worth checking out :)"}
{"text":"Ask for over easy eggs and they mentioned the eggs are premixed! What kind of fresh ingredients is premixed especially eggs....Ordered white menudo and it was ok. My husband ordered chicken tacos and the shredded chicken was cool as if it was refrigerated ...I would never come back..."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food! Authentic Mexican food which sometimes is hard to find considering that there's places that supposedly sell authentic Mexican food and it's not! Phenomenal service by everyone there. Was greeted upon entering which some times is unusual in business. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I expected more based off other reviews the service is good tight seating area I just was expecting more flavor from the fried bread taco it was basically a chulopa from Taco Bell my husband enjoyed the soup"}
{"text":"This was so yummy!  A place we found for dinner.  One of the best Frybread I have had."}
{"text":"Great green chili sopapilla. Staff was very friendly and smiling. I will be back very soon."}
{"text":"Discovered this place through reviews while looking for a way to kill a few hours before our flight.  Not that far from the airport, but not exactly adjacent.  Located on the corner of a two-story commercial building, this little place is the real deal.  The fry bread is great and a nice alternative to flour and corn tortillas, but it's the sauces that keep me wanting more.  The red sauce is made from pickled jalapenos and garlic and has an incredible pepper flavor without just beating you over the head with heat. 

I only get down to Phoenix once a year, but this is definitely a place that I plan to go back to next year."}
{"text":"I had to get fry bread before leaving for Arizona, so I stopped by Maria's Frybread before heading to the airport. Appreciate all of the reviews that noted the yellow van in the parking lot as it caught my attention. The restaurant is tucked in the corner or the strip mall.

Had a wonderful lunch at Maria's and the service was excellent. They checked on me throughout my eating experience to see how everything was. I ordered the sopapilla since it was vegetarian. The owner also provided complimentary guacamole (yum!). The fry bread was thicker and slightly soggy due to the toppings, but it was very filling. It was a pleasant surprise when the owner provided a complimentary fry bread (the dessert version). Added my own amount of powdered sugar and honey. YUMM.. loved the crispiness of the bread.

I was told that there will be more vegetarian items on the menu. 

If I'm in the area, I would come back again."}
{"text":"I almost didn't go here because I couldn't find a menu online, but the reviews were so good that I took a chance. I'm so glad I did. This place was amazing and my new favorite Mexican restaurant! It hits the trifecta: great food, great service and ridiculously cheap prices. I got the frybread taco and my husband got the savory sopapilla. We got it with green chili that was amazing. I could have just eaten the green chili by itself. The meal also came with housemade tortilla chips and three kinds of salsa. The tortilla chips are addicting and the salsas are spicy and flavorful. The guys working there were really nice and helpful. I was kind of expecting a bare-bones operation, but they brought the food to us, checked occasionally to make sure we had everything, chatted with us about which menu items to order, etc. The decor is charmingly hole-in-the-wall, which I liked. We will definitely be coming here on a regular basis!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience after always seeing people in and out. It was ok. My tortilla was not cooked at all on my breakfast burrito and the ingredients weren't proportioned properly,mostly eggs. The people were very friendly but the quality of food served here is more on the food truck side of things."}
{"text":"Always fantastic food and service!! I could eat there 5 days a week!! It's my absolute favorite place to stop for a quick lunch, always fast and delicious. The green chili beef open faced frybread is a must try. Good horchata. The staff are some of the friendliest folks you'll ever meet, I wish them all the success in the world!! Thanks for food and service done right"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. No beer here so be prepared. 
Tamales were amazing. Also know that the yellow bottle is the spiciest sauce you have ever tasted. You have been warned. Authentic Mexican food. Also don't sleep on the tacos."}
{"text":"Excellent! Bummed I didn't try this place sooner. It's right down the street from me but I never tried it. The food is amazing, super inexpensive & the service was great. And, I love that they have a drive through. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place at lunch...I sampled the red and green chile (both tasted great)...I ended up getting the sopapilla with green chile, beans, lettuce, cheese and tomato...Big portion and every bite was delicious...I will be back and would totally recommend it."}
{"text":"Delicious! The sopapilla and tostada was amazing! The staff was helpful in making choices and very friendly!"}
{"text":"Really small but such a cute, cozy little place. Went here on a whim with a craving for fry bread and was not disappointed. Service was awesome too. Really glad I discovered this place because I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Great little place where I enjoyed my first fry bread taco ever.  Had the green chile beef and side of chips.  Staff was extremely friendly and were outstanding and helpful.  They have a lot of other menu items as well so you can find something for everyone.  Glad the reviews brought me here they were right.  Would cone back if I am ever in the area."}
{"text":"Frybread! It's a take on a native american specialty and it was actually delicious.
It's kind of near the airport so if your on your way there it's convenient.

It's smothered in refried beans and cheese, lettuce....I got chicken and ate the whole thing. I was only expecting to eat half but it was good order one for yourself you won't want to share.

Probably the first and only time I'll have native american frybread i'm going with a big 4 stars!"}
{"text":"This is a great hole in the wall. It's difficult to find if you miss the yellow van parked in the strip mall with a sign pointing to it. It's located behind the Pet Club. The place is nice and clean with a small dining area and additional seating in back of the restaurant. I had the green chili frybread with rice and beans. And, horchata for my beverage. Carlos (Maria's son) greets you with a big smile. I could see Maria in the back cooking. The green chili was tasty with chunks of beef. Also, the rice and beans were really good. My friend and I got a sopapilla to share. It was delicious and we got to add the powered sugar, honey and cinnamon to it. Overall, this place was a yummy local find. I hope the poor location doesn't cause its demise. Try it and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Don't let the location or the area fool you.  This place is good.   Greene chili is awesome.    No bar but everything else including the service was outstanding."}
{"text":"Fast service and food taste great. Carne asada fries and i got a frybread with green chili. Yummmmm"}
{"text":"I frequent Maria's weekly and it does not disappoint. Super nice people and the place is clean. Prices aren't bad and the food is great! I encourage all to stop in and see for themselves."}
{"text":"Very nice little place that servers \"authentic\" Mexican food.   Service was very fast and all the dishes were Well prepared.  Total bill for the 3 of us was only $21 and that included a refill on Jamaica.   Don't miss this place, entire staff was outstanding."}
{"text":"Awesome food, awesome service!!  Great variety of food, fry read was the bomb.com!  A must try!!

Owner was very helpful explaining the menu! Very personable!!"}
{"text":"All I can say is wow!..  I have never had Mexican Frybread but this was delicious and new.  I also had a chicken enchilada that was the most delicate and tasty enchilada I have ever put in my mouth.  The restaurant is small in a little strip mall but also has a drive thru.  7 inside tables and two outside picnic tables.  It is worth the search with lots authentic Mexican dishes on the menu!"}
{"text":"We stopped in last night for dinner after reading all of the amazing reviews on Yelp.  The staff is so welcoming and friendly, the space is small, but clean and the food is simply amazing!  I enjoyed a jamaica (hibiscus) drink and the sopapilla with green chile beef and my husband enjoyed the green chile chicken enchiladas with rice and beans...so delicious!  We will definitely be back...and soon!"}
{"text":"Defining 'healthy' is beyond the nutritional value but food believed to be 'good for you' or 'good for your mind/attitude'.  And this improved my mind by making my mouth very happy  with the simple pleasures of homemade food from a family owned restaurant made with caring.  And there really is a 'Maria': she's the mom. 

Very sweet, professional & beyond accommodating!  Was more than willing to answer any questions I had for him about the menu & his recommendation.  Also, a mother came in & asked for the use of the restroom without purchasing food but they didn't even hesitate in letting them use it. Like I said very sweet. Plus kept asking me how was my food & if I needed anything else. 

The green chili w/ beans SOPAPILLA (it's open face compared to fry bread taco: which is folded). The green chili was drool worthy lol.  I could've ate an entire bowl, pot whatever they wanted to give it to me. Ok SOPAPILLA won over a bowl since it's edible & yummy.  And it came with homemade chips. 

Love the fact it wasn't greasy; because, it made me feel a tiny bit better that it wasn't 'healthy'.  Definitely will come back & recommend. 

FYI:  Corner spot facing 40th Street & across the street from the WSS store with it being right behind Pet Club.  Has a drive thru & additional seating in back of restaurant."}
{"text":"There are so many things about Maria's that I like...

I give them 5 stars because the food and service were both excellent.  I basically did not read any negative reviews on Yelp before deciding to try this place.  The owner told us they only opened about 10 weeks ago.

First of all, it is tucked away so please make sure if you are using google maps, look for the bright yellow van with Maria's Frybread written on it and it is in that shopping plaza.

When we walked in, my friend and I obviously looked confused so the guy working there asked if we needed help and gave us recommendations.  My friend is a vegetarian so she had the sopapilla with just no meat but I had the sopapilla with the green chili.  It was delicious!!!  We ordered at the counter and had our food delivered within minutes.  They also said the tamales are great as well so I definitely want to come back and try it!  The green chili had a little spice to it.  They also give you a green salsa on the side as well as a red one.  I liked both but I liked the red one a little bit better.  My friend thought the red one was spicier.

I wish I lived closer because I would definitely come here a few more times.  I also felt that it felt very family run and the service was great.  They noticed that my friend had stepped out for a while for a phone call so they offered to wrap up her meal so it didn't get too cold."}
{"text":"I love this place.  We eat here about once per week.  Carlos always greets us with a smile and seems genuinely happy to see us. Everything on the menu is awesome and the staff is super friendly.  The restaurant is always clean, no matter how busy they are.  It's a small place, but they take pride in what they do.

Stop by and try the frybread with green chili, be sure to say Hello to Carlos!  Tell them the staff at Urban Trend Builders sent you! :)"}
{"text":"Fast, tasty, cheep.. everything you wanted when you walked in!!

A quaint little respite from the fray. 
A bottle of coke will smooth your parched lips and the fry bread will live up to your expectations.

The staff is friendly, the food is as authentic as the ambiance. Try the hot sauce, it will light up your world."}
{"text":"My heart is singing with JOY.  Some of the best food ever. The cheese enchiladas taste like I just made them.  Beans are heavenly . Just right. After just one bite I made a beeline to the counter to order more of EVERYTHING. You have to come in to eat and meet some of the nice's people. There is dine in or a drive thru to order on your way home or work. IT'S JUST THAT GOOD."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and every time, it's amazing! 
I recommend the red chile open frybread, but the green is good too. Chicken enchiladas are delish, and the chicken is real white meat shredded, no sketchy chicken here. The beans? Creamy, tasty, nom! The enchilada sauce actually tastes like chile, unlike so many others places that taste bland.
Go go go, is my recommendation. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent customer service. It was what I was expecting because you shouldn't go wrong with fry bread."}
{"text":"Good fry bread and I received excellent customer service.  The food was ready so fast"}
{"text":"Service is friendly and welcoming.  Food is great.  The rice is very traditional and yummy! 

Hubby and the kids had the fry bread and said it was great! I had the tacos and rice.  Super great.  Definitely stop by again."}
{"text":"Great food, great customer service. Polite, smiling, out-of-the way helpful. Walked in on a hunch and it's absolutely worth it.

If you're in the area and you want a family feel lunch or dinner, you can't go wrong with Maria's."}
{"text":"Small little joint, great food and service. Food portions were spot on for the price. Will be repeating soon. My popover was really good. I was a little worried about getting one here just because I've only had my mom's and ones at the Fry Bread House but I was amazed on how good it was. It was fresh and tasted amazing. I recommended this place to anybody who is looking for a good eat"}
{"text":"First time coming here and it will not be my last. The tacos were full of shredded beef absolutely delicious. I ordered Indian fry bread with being and cheese, and they do not skimp on the cheese! Very nice staff! I took the drive-through and they were very fast and well packaged the food to go. Happy that I have a place close by me for Indian fry bread. :-)"}
{"text":"I finally found a restaurant that can make a solid bowl of menudo.  Delicious!  The restaurant is clean, service is friendly/fast, and the food is made with love.  We will definitely be back for more menudo, green chili, frybread, and horchata.  Can't wait to try the other menu items.  I only gave it four stars because I wasn't too crazy about the salsa.  BTW...a gal came in ordering salsa because she loved it.  Shoot, I'll make my own salsa and goto Marie's for everything else in that food genre."}
{"text":"Fry bread was tasty and hot. We dined in and everyone loved their food. I tasted my mom's carne asada and it was bland. The beans were fresh and tasty as well. We enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"With all the stellar reviews, I was probably over prepared for my experience at Maria's Frybread & Mexican Food. This small neighborhood Mexican restaurant in central Phoenix offers a standard taqueria style menu with the notable addition of fry bread options. They are located on 40th & Thomas in the strip mall on the southeastern corner with the large FRYBREAD sign in the window.

I am a fry bread junkie. There is just something about a deep fried piece of warm and chewy dough surrounding sweet or savory options. I know the troubled history of the bread and its unique status among modern Native Americans, but I can still appreciate its place in modern cuisine. Maria's was listed very high on Yelp for this, and I always appreciate my Mexican food when visiting Phoenix.

The interior of the restaurant is typical of most taquerias in the Valley, but the service was especially warm and friendly. My order was taken and served quickly, with a fry bread taco with red chili beef. I was rather disappointed with the overall choice. The fry bread is more like a sopapilla lacking the chewy and pliable texture of native fry bread, but even as a sopapilla it was rather bland. The red chili beef was also rather mild compared to many other places in Phoenix.

The chips and hot sauce were as warm as the staff which was nice, but it is hard to overlook the fry bread especially since it is part of the restaurant name and advertising. The mild flavor of the red chili beef would be expected at home in Sacramento, but seems especially mild for the Phoenician palette. I am glad I tried Maria's, but there are just too many misses to recommend coming back."}
{"text":"Extremely warm place. Super friendly people and homemade authentic Mexican food. Family owned and operated eatery."}
{"text":"Major disappointment. Ordered machaca burritos. Got home to eat them and discovered we'd paid $18 for bean burritos with a little bit of machaca beef sprinkled in. Seriously?! Not cool."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my Husband earlier for dinner and the food was amazing! The green chili was a perfect amount of spice! The service was great and the food was even better. Such a cute little mom and pop restaurant. I'm recommending everyone I know. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"As big fans of frybread, we were excited to have this place go in nearby. The frybread itself was cooked well and crispy, but putting a bunch of taco ingredients inside made a bit of a soggy mess. The tamales and salsa were good. A traditional frybread with honey and powdered sugar for dessert is a must. Overall a pretty good meal. We will go back."}
{"text":"This place has the best Red & Green Chili Frybread ever!! My husband and I live in Chandler and every once in a while when we have a craving for frybread, and we have the time, we will take a drive to Phoenix to go eat at Maria's Frybread. It is just that yummy!!"}
{"text":"Food = amazing. Family owned, very friendly staff. The frybread  taco is sooooooo good. Yum!"}
{"text":"My husband was the one who introduced me to this place, they have good breakfast burritos, I also tried their sweet frybread, as well; the chicken, beans, sour cream on frybread I don't recall the name, I think you can place any topping available on the frybread, shredded  beef, guacamole etc., my husband got those a couple of times, it is all good!!!, We would gladly come back soon."}
{"text":"Finally made it back to try the pozole - excellent!  Generous and meaty bowl with all the fixin's plus a good warmed flour tortilla for about $7.  Folks working there were very nice.  If you're into pozole - this is a great spot for you."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service. Stopped in from  out of town. First fry bread experience. was  not sure what to expect but ended up loving it. Try the verde sauce!"}
{"text":"All you'd expect from a place rated this high. Excellent customer service, everyone had a smile on and were eager to help with all we needed. Although it was lunchtime, there wasn't a long wait. And the food... we had a tamale, a breakfast burrito and a fry bread taco - all amongst the very best in Phoenix. This is a top shelf choice, get here if you can."}
{"text":"I love this place! !! Not only is the food AWESOME so is the customer service.  The open face fry bread is the best! !! I've also had to chimichanga which is mouth watering good.  Go check them out its worth it.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The Frybread was not what I was expecting, it was more like a flatten Sopapilla. Carne asada tacos were super dried out. They get two stars just because they had strawberry soda."}
{"text":"I very much enjoyed my visit to Maria's Frybread.  Service was friendly and prompt.  They helped point me towards what i would like, and they were spot on.  

I ordered the Sopapillas with half red sauce and half green sauce and it tastes wonderful.  Ingredients tasted fresh and they were portioned wonderfully.  My only tiny complaint is that my meal was about 10% more expensive than I would have thought - mostly through the soda - $0.80 cent refills on a $1.79 fountain drink?

I plan to return and eat there again - overall a very good meal and a good experience."}
{"text":"Second time here and it does not disappoint.  The fry bread is fantastic and fast. I had the green chili fry bread and I wish I had more room for a dessert fry bread. They are super friendly.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for some great fry bread."}
{"text":"So happy we found this place. The food came out fast and it was delicious with generous portions. The pickled jalapeño salsa was a delightful surprise.  Despite being very full, I couldn't stop eating it.  Don't judge me.  Very friendly staff. Even my very picky 12 year old son said we needed to put this place on our return to list. High praise indeed."}
{"text":"Was craving fry bread, was going to go to fry house! But my husband had heard lots of great things about this place. So we had to try. deffently didn't fall short from the reviews very fast service  food was great,  Customer Service was excellent deffently come again."}
{"text":"I'm quite astonished - saddened, actually - by what passes for good Mexican food in Arizona. You would think this state's proximity to Mexico would mean that people here have a sophisticated palate when it comes to Mexican food. Nothing seems further from the truth. All of these five-star reviews are celebrating this establishment's ability to take a store-bought tortilla, stuff it with something that comes out of a can, sprinkling cheddar cheese on top (CHEDDAR on Mexican food???), and plopping that mess in front of a customer.

The bottom line for me is that the food here is quite disgusting. If you want to sample some really amazing, authentic Mexican food then go check out La Santissima in Phoenix or Glendale. Now THAT is real food, not the cheddar-cloaked garbage like this place serves. Maria: Stick with frybread, you suck at Mexican. Even Macayo's tastes better."}
{"text":"I had some high expectations, considering how awesome frybread is. They didnt disappoint with the frybread, but all the other ingredient seemed mediocre. I ordered the frybread taco and couldnt help thinking they skimped out on the quality of the other ingredients. The bread is wonderful though, and I would probably order it by itself if I had to eat here again. I recognize that this is a ma and pop shop. The clerk/owner? was really nice and I could tell that there establishment is a humble one. But I cannot understand people giving this place five stars across the board. Maybe I need to try the menudo or pozole next time."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff & atmosphere, super clean (\"A\" health code posted on door), great food and great prices.  Navajo tacos were really good, fry bread is excellent."}
{"text":"Family time at this amazing Mexican restaurant! the best customer service. My daughter made a huge mess and didn't complain just cleaned it up and I really appreciate them."}
{"text":"This was the first time my friends and I came here and it was mainly due to the already amazing Yelp reviews. They definitely did not disappoint! 

Portion sizes were huge and the customer service was amazing (they were really helpful with our selections, very accommodating, and extremely friendly). 

Definitely would love to come back -- the food was delicious! I got the chicken enchiladas with red chili (he recommended the red) and it did not disappoint. The complimentary chips are also really good (my friend was obsessed and took them home)."}
{"text":"Cheese enchiladas are so perfect and the chorizo and egg burrito awesome.   Also had the green chile so tasty.   The Family who runs it are awesome and the whole place so clean.   Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Great portions! The salsa on the side is good. But surprisingly the entrees themselves were very flavorless, left us craving something savory. To be fair, the fry bread per se was good, but the meat lacked any sort of seasoning, which was strange. . . Overall very low quality food, reminiscent of taco bell."}
{"text":"Loved it!!! I found this on yelp and had to try it while I was in AZ. The staff were all so friendly and the food was great! I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Worth Every Calorie

If you're searching for a fancy restraunt to dine then Maria's isn't for you.  However,  if what you're looking for is hot, crispy, and delicious Frybread, then look no further, Maria's Frybread and Mexican Food is calling your name. 

Maria's Frybread and Mexican Food is a real gem. The decor is not fancy by any means however, the restraunt is comfortable, clean, and the staff is accomadating. The menu at Maria's has something to satisfy everyones taste, from the sweet to the savory. I wasn't sure what I should order on my first visit to Maria's. However, the owner took the time to explain the menu, gave samples and helped me decide what kind of frybread to order. 

On this visit I opted for savory rather than sweet and settled on the red chili beef Taco, made with refried beans, red chili beef, onions, shredded cheese, and lettuce. My lunch companion went with the green chili. 

As we were waitng for our fry bread we were given a complimentary basket of hot tortilla chips and salsa.  The tortilla chips at Maria's were absolutely delicious and were everything a torilla chip should be, fresh, hot, crispy, and lightly salted. I could have ate the entire basket myself.

After our chips it was time for our frybread. Although, the fry bread is made to order, our frybread was served quickly.  The frybread portions at Maria's are big (larger than the plate) and are delicious. The frybread was light, airy, served hot, and so flavorful and the red chili meat was lean and delicious.  I can't recall a time when I had better tasting frybread. 

Just when I thought my meal couldn't get any better the owner came out with a hot basket of complementary sopaipillas with honey, cinnamon, and powdered sugar, and the sopaipillas were fantastic. I couldnt beleive how much delicious food we devoured at Maria's but it was worth every calorie.

If you ever find yourself with a hankering for frybead, at a restaurant with great customer service and wallet friendly prices give Maria's a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Food came out SUPER FAST after ordering(about 3mins), so fast that I was skeptical that it was cooked fresh. We recieved the order and it was piping hot, the frybread was hot and crispy. Tried one red chile and one green, both were delicious. Workers were attentive and friendly. The fast service is definitely a plus, will be returning for lunch soon."}
{"text":"Ordered sopapilla / open veggie fry bread. Not so great but a good quantity for money. 

Service is real fast. One time visit place."}
{"text":"Really great compared to other frybread places I've had. My son and I shared a carne asada sopapilla with beans, cheese, and tomato and a plain one with honey and powdered sugar. The beans on top were super flavorful and the meat was good. I wish I didn't live so far away from this place. The best part was the SUPER friendly staff. The only thing I would have done differently would be waiting to order the plain one for dessert until we were finished with the first one. That way it would have still been hot when we ate it but still great nonetheless."}
{"text":"My son and I have eaten here every Friday for a month. Every time we go out we decide to go somewhere else, but end up here anyway. This time we came on Saturday. The food is excellent and the staff there is wonderful. AWESOME !!!"}
{"text":"Would have taken a picture, but i ate it too fast.  Gonna come back here for sure.  Been to a few other places and frybread is a little greasy still, this place nicely well done.  Green chili frybread taco is ridiculously good.  Even the regular shredded beef taco is awesome.  Look for this place behind the pet food store.  They should take down the pet place to make more room for this place.

Edit: Plain frybread, dress it up yourself with whatever amount honey, cinnamon, powdered sugar....oh my god........going into food coma now."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've have in Arizona. Pozole is unbelievable. Awesome service and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Clean and unassuming. Small seating area, but several tables occupied at 445p. Smells good, no floor cleaner . Man behind counter efficient and pleasant, waited while I debated, then took the order smoothly.
Food showed up in. A minute or two, three different salsas, mild, spicy and picante. Bowl of flour tortilla chips, unusual. The mild salsa is pretty mild. Tomato-ish. The spicy is green and full of flavor, with a nice kick. The picante is sufficiently so, with a smooth finish.
Was hoping that the burrito would somehow incorporate a piece of frybread, but instead came wrapped in a standard flour tortilla. Will have to be more explicit in the future.
Carne asada is tender, no gristle, and flavorful. Flour tortilla uninspired. Salsas are all nice, prefer the warmer two. The small side of lettuce and tomato was pleasant and fresh tasting.
Maybe I'll come back here again, and next time make sure I get it on frybread!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is great! My favorite thing is actually the chips.  They're really thick and crispy. I also like that you can ask for both salsas. Besides that the frybread is obviously a good choice but really you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! They have fry bread and traditional Mexican food too. I had the red chili fry bread and it came out in two mins! Amazing. The place was very clean and very friendly staff working there. No doubt try this place!"}
{"text":"First time I had red chili Indian taco and the pozole. Both were great, especially the pozole. It's a different flavor than I'm used too but it was one of the best I ever had. Next visit I went specifically for the pozole ( I was craving for a week) and I tried the green Chile tostada. Tostada was good but pozole was not consistent. I ordered it with corn tortillas, I got flour...no biggie, but the broth seemed very watered down, broth was almost clear. Flavor not as good. Was a little disappointed. :("}
{"text":"Tried their fry bread with chile verde. Everything tastes great. I'd probably try something else since the fry bread is thick and very filling."}
{"text":"This restaurant was good. The service was great, fast and super courteous. Beans were very good. Red Chile and everything else was ok to good I've had my fair share of Frybread and red Chile! Menudo was too greasy though!"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! Both my boyfriend and I got frybread. We got a bean and cheese one, as well as red chili beef with lettuce, tomato, cheese. I was really impressed with both. The red chili was really flavorful. You know how red chili sometimes just tastes \"red\"? This one was a million times better. The frybread was crispy too, without tasting overly oily and fried. They also have a fantastic array of paletas."}
{"text":"This spot is right down the street from us and after seeing the awesome reviews, we had to give it a try. 

It is located on the Southeast corner of Thomas and 40th street behind Pet Club. It is a very small restaurant, I think there were only 5 small tables inside. When ordering, I was standing directly next to someone who was enjoying their meal!

Now, to the good. We order a bean & cheese fry bread, red chili & cheese fry bread, a powdered sugar & honey fry bread, chips & salsa, and a massive pickle (random, I know). All of this was to go.

The portion size was huge and the toppings were overflowing. To our disappointment though, they did not include powdered sugar or honey... only a plain fry bread. Now this wasn't a huge deal since we had both ingredients, but if I were visiting from out of town, it would have been a heart breaking moment! 

Overall, we will be back. They don't only serve fry bread, they have a nice list of other Mexican entrees. 

Oh and before I forget, if you like pickles, try one! They are huge and delicious for only $1!   

Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Took a lift to get here, arrived later than intended but still 22 minutes before close, and the door was locked.  Employees had already finished cleaning up."}
{"text":"The food was very tasty and served hot and fresh. The three choices of salsa were awesome from flavor to levels of hotness. Also great value. Had to take home leftovers. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"We don't have frybread places in the Bay Area that I'm aware of, so decided to check out Maria's Frybread during my last trip to Arizona. My friend and I came for a late lunch around 2pm on a Thursday, and it wasn't busy at the time. We ordered and paid at the cashier, and they delivered our dishes at our table less than 10 minutes later. We tried:

-Carne Asada Enchilada w/Green Sauce ($3.49, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=x8LeSyv0cmGe9rvqCAAi3Q&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Yum, this was an awesome price for an enchilada, and I loved the cheesiness of this dish- Recommended!
-Green Chile Sopapilla/Frybread ($8.49, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=BNWV62Jzm6EUUTBFdGLaCA&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): This is a GIANT piece of frybread, and it is loaded with toppings. I liked the chewy-crispy consistency of the frybread, and was glad I tried this, but I actually liked the enchilada more. This is worth trying once though. 
-Guacamole ($1.49): Good, but not the best guacamole I've had. Worth ordering only if you are craving guac.

Service is ok, they are helpful but not the friendliest. There are a few tables to dine in, but they also have a drive thru option. If you dine in, make sure you use the different sauces available in the squeeze bottles in their soda fridge! I would definitely come back to try additional dishes if I lived in the area. Parking wasn't bad when we came since there were plenty of spaces, but the spots are on the smaller side."}
{"text":"Looking for creative Mexican food. Look no more. Recently discovered Maria's and can't wait to go back. 
It's tucked away in a small strip center and may be a little difficult to locate. But it's worth the effort. 
This is not your run of the mill fare. 
The food is delicious and the servings are generous. They offer fry bread tacos which are to die for. I had the enchiladas and not only was it a treat for the palate but it was plated in a way that just looking at it one could tell it was going to be delish. 
Five stars for the food but 3 stars for somewhat inconsistent service."}
{"text":"Frybread was hot and fresh and fast. Traditional enchiladas and burritos too. 

The restaurant is very clean and they are super friendly."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some Mexican food and Yelp suggested this little gem. As you walk in the door they greet you with a smile and welcome you in. Menu is pretty standard Mexican with the addition of the fry bread options. Think thick fluffy fried tortilla covered in green chili beef and beans. See picture. My favorite dish to order is the Pozole. That's right, Pozole! Is your mouth watering yet?

At your table they give you salsa and house made chips. They range in spice level from hot, medium, and mild. They are all good, but I like the spicy green salsa the most. 

The decor is homey and fun. They have a drive through for call in orders but I haven't used it myself. You can tell they really care about their business and their customers. Well deserved."}
{"text":"Go here!!!!!!!! Go here!!!!!!! Go here!!!!!!! I just want to drop the mic and walk away. Dang it, why aren't you listening, leave already. This place is great and deserves five stars. Just great damn food by great people. Everything was super good...chips?..yep, salsa?..yep, burrito..yep, plain sopapilla?..yep. What else you want me say? Leave already :)"}
{"text":"this is a hole in the wall restaurant. it is hidden behind a pet store and amidst a bunch of other high rated restaurants.  The fry bread wasn't too greasy, the toppings were bountiful. Made to order. We got a taco fry bread with ground beef.  The beef was bland but the salsa ( two types) had a kick. We really wanted one with cinnamon and sugar but both had gym clothes on and bellies were already hanging out.  We also got a burrito to go, which was huge and again packed with beans, chicken and cheese. Exactly all I wanted in the burrito.  The owner?Manager? was really nice, checked up on us a couple times. you can tell he really wanted us to like our food and return. The others were nice too, just really quiet but then I'm a big guy and I am told I intimidate people ( I mean when I am hAngry...I can totally see that my face would be intense on getting food.) 
We will go back. definitely a good place and good fresh food."}
{"text":"Fabulous little place this is. Only a few tables inside and I was a bit shocked at first, but it's actually very charming. The sopapillas are the go-to here and the food comes out lighting fast. Will definitely be back. They also have a drive-through."}
{"text":"This little restaurant used to be located at the Indoor Swap Mart.  When the building burned down, I was really bummed about the fry bread because it was so good. Flash forward a few years and I found them at a new location!  Maria's fry bread with red chili beef is the best around! I have tried their tamales and a few other things and they all taste excellent! Love it! I live in Scottsdale, but the drive is worth it to me."}
{"text":"So excited that we finally stopped in this little place. We had really yummy fry bread and can't wait to go back to try the rest of the menu. The salsas were tasty with various levels of heat. The food came out quickly and piping hot. The staff was super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"If you are in the area, go to Maria's Frybread and Mexican Food! The atmosphere is clean and friendly and Maria works in the kitchen making the most delicious and authentic Mexican food. The frybread taco is out of this world! This will be my go-to place for all my future Phoenix visits!"}
{"text":"OMG! I love this place. I would definitely say that they offer great comfort food with the frybreads! The bread had a really nice crisp outside and a lighter and fluffy inside. I would think that the frybread would be a little greasy but it was not greasy at all! I ordered the sopapilla with carne asada, which comes with refried beans, lettuce, tomato, and cheese on top of the frybread. Personally for me the bean made it a little to heavy for me even though the sopapilla itself was phenomenal. Next time, I will probably replace the beans with gaucamole instead and ask for extra lettuce for a more fresh and crunch aspect that I want. The salsas that come out in the bottle are really good. My favorite was the spiciest salsa that they have. It had really good flavor. I was a little disappointed because I was hoping it was going to be really hot but it was a little more on the mellow side. The chip here are homemade and I would not expect anything less of this family ran restaurant. The chips were delicious! The chips are thick and they are cooked perfectly to have this amazing crispiness and the texture was on point! I love that they have the fast food quickness but have the option to dine-in with actual ceramic plates. I really feel like I was coming into their home to have dinner. On top of it, since it is a family owned restaurant, the service was impeccable. The people who own this place are extremely friendly, helpful, and clearly care about the product they put out and their customers' needs."}
{"text":"Amazing! Need I say more, but of course I will! Perfect fry bread, perfect Navajo taco. Quaint place, clean and very friendly! Hard working staff and great prices too. Everything you want in one cute, yummy, little place."}
{"text":"Oh boy, how can you be in AZ and not want Mexican food? I looked on YELP and saw the reviews for this place and decided that I just had to stop there. 

I ordered a taco platter on soft corn tortillas. The platter comes w 3 tacos, whichever kind you want, a side of rice and some refried beans. I asked for some super hot sauce. The hottest they have. Oh boy, I think he put HELL in a cup. That was HOT!!! but flavorful and so good. I also asked for a side of guacamole. The place is good, inexpensive and leaves you wanting to come back another day. 

The tortillas are lightly friend, which leaves them soft but slightly crispy. It was oh so yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Overall, not impressed. Given all the positive reviews, I had high hopes. My wife got a cheese enchilada, which she liked,  but said the red sauce was a little bland, and I got the  carne asada frybread taco, and the carne asada tasted like something in between corned beef hash and the smell of dog food. I ended up throwing 3/4 of it away. The beans were good, but the rice was nearly flavorless. My son has chicken street tacos, and they were ok. If I go back, I'll definitely avoid the carne asada."}
{"text":"This place is great! Upon arrival, you are greeted with a friendly smile by the owner. You order at the counter, and they bring you delicious goodies to your table.

For my visit, I order the Frybread with carne asada and red menudo. 

The Frybread was nice and crispy, and I loved the carne asada. We asked for light beans and it was perfect. It tasted like a cross between a taco and nachos. We also requested guacamole on the side, which enhances the dish further. 

The red menudo was delicious! It came with a side of onions, cilantro, corn tortilla, oregano and red pepper to complement the dish. However, it did have a little bit sodium than I wanted (I was so thirsty after). I also wished that the tripe pieces were a tad bigger.

This place is in a nondescript strip mall, and there is parking in the front!"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time. It isn't close to where I live but I was dropping someone at the airport. That being said, I will be making the trip here more often. The restaurant sits in an unsuspectingly small corner, which is fine because the staff (presumably the owner) were all super friendly, enthusiastic, and obviously enjoyed what they were doing. For about 8 bucks you can get a huge frybread taco that is enough for two meals. By no means did they sacrificed quality for quantity. The fry bread was cooked to perfection, a nicely browned exterior with a soft spongy interior. I had the green Chile and red Chile beef split half and half and honestly cannot say which side I enjoyed more. Highly recommend this place and I can't wait to go back and explore the menu further."}
{"text":"My cousin was in town visiting me and had read about this place. So we decided to check it out. IT IS DELICIOUS. I wish I would have known about it sooner as I just relocated to MN. 

Service is excellent. Family owned business. Very attentive. Kind. Friendly. 

THE FOOD. We couldn't stop ordering. I think we went up to the counter 3 times to keep ordering more food. It was all delicious. Even for a dessert sopapilla to go!"}
{"text":"This relatively small Husband and Wife here at Maria's is pure authentic and fresh Mexican food .  The freshness of the  Pozole made in house makes for a hearty bowl of comfort.  The fresh beans are cooked right here in site as is the chili that is blended fresh .  The prices are very reasonable and well worth the portions. The husband and wife team make this quaint eatery a great place for lunch !  It's a must try for those seeking real and authentic fresh made Mexican comfort food."}
{"text":"I can definitely see the appeal of Maria's.  It's hard to find negative things to say about a clean restaurant with friendly faces & tasty cheap eats.  My husband split a sopaipillas before a beer tour, and it was plenty filling.  Bonus: there were three different types of salsas to top our savory fry bread with, all of which we liked.  Bookmark Maria's for a future budget-friendly lunch, and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Relied on the reviews when we landed at the Phoenix airport very hungry.  So glad we did! Delicious authentic and very friendly service.  Great place!"}
{"text":"Great food, very delicious and filling. Wonderful service very friendly. The tostadas are made fresh and  are crispy. Hot sauces are on the mild side but have amazing flavor."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Frybread tacos are to die for! Great portion sizes. So glad we found this place!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice. I generally get a green chile burrito but this time I had a chimichanga instead. I think I prefer the burrito and the error was mine. I cannot say enough about the people who run the place. Both times they were very polite, attentive, and friendly. My wife wanted menudo but because it's hot weather they only make it on Saturdays and we went on Friday. I tasted my wife's menudo last time we ate there and it was as good as any I've had anywhere. It's beef tripe which means those who don't eat pork can partake. This place makes excellent frybread, refries from scratch which don't taste anything like Rosarita's,  and they even make their own chips. This is food made like you'd do it at home, and Maria's son said that's how she makes it. If you're looking for fancy you're in the wrong place. If you're more interested in authenticity you've made a good choice. Both times we were there others also left pleased with their meal."}
{"text":"Sooooo good!!!! Being originally from New Mexico, my fiancé and I are VERY picky when it comes to our chile..... happy to say, we were NOT disappointed! Also the gentleman at the register was so nice to recommend his favorite meals to us!! Come try it!!!!!"}
{"text":"We had the Frybread taco with ground beef and the three cheese enchilada with rice and beans, everything was DELICIOUS!!!

For dessert we had the Frybread and they brought out honey, powdered sugar, and cinnamon sugar to top it off!

A must try!!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff greet you upon entering this drive through/sit down restaurant.  A solid 4 star for their fry bread taco.  While you are waiting, you get free chips and a selection of 3 salsas.  Very quick service with the food brought to your table.  Hubby got one beef and one chicken enchilada.  He thought the meats were overly salty so 3 stars on that.  Gave him a bite of mine and he liked it much better.  For some reason he associated frybread taco being too small.  It filled the plate.  Next time he will know better."}
{"text":"We'd been to Maria's before and experienced their great hospitality, but this time was superior! I ordered the #7, chimichanga with rice and beans, and asked for ground beef in the chimi. The gentleman behind the counter recommended the shredded beef because having all that ground beef could be a little much. So, I ordered my chimi with shredded beef and let me tell you...IT WAS BOMB!!!! Hands down, one of the BEST chimichangs I have ever eaten!! I LOVE Maria's!!!!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical at first when I seen this place, it looks so little and cramped and not very clean from the outside. After seeing the A from food inspection on the front window, I was relieved.  I stepped inside and noticed that they have extra seating in the back, Thank God! I ordered the green chili open Frybread with a side of rice and beans. The service here is very friendly and makes you feel appreciated for visiting. The food was spectacular! The green chili was so flavorful! The rice is a little plain but that's not enough to make me stop coming back! Will definitely be coming here again soon!"}
{"text":"Great place! Awesome food and service!! 
Whenever I'm in Phoenix I will come back!! 
We had the combination number 3 and 9!"}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican food I have found in AZ.  Masa for tamale was old style absolutely wonderful.  Husband had nachos which came in a fry bread bowl, huge! He said they were the very best.  Refried beans are outstanding and all there sauces were excellent.  Will go back any time we can.  Also they use real cheese not imitation."}
{"text":"Maria's opened three days ago.  Frybread is good. Drive thru with fast service. Looking forward to trying more things on the menu.  Will start with 4 stars until I have more items from here."}
{"text":"Best cheese enchiladas around. The service is amazing. The food is great and they treat your like the only guests"}
{"text":"More than anything, I was so impressed with the customer service.  Giving us samples, making sure we had everything, bringing rice for my toddler, and chips for our table. We all tried the fry bread which was FANTASTIC!  It was a nice change from the other Mexican restaurants. I got the red chili on fry bread and my boys loves the fry bread with cinnamon. We will be going back."}
{"text":"Solid lil place. Chips are made in house and are to die for. I swooped a breakfast burrito and it was good enough that I will return for more. The service was amazing and done with a smile."}
{"text":"Wonderful!! I had been meaning to check this place out for a while and now I'm kicking myself for not going sooner! The food was spectacular. The place is clean, inviting and friendly. We were also very impressed with the attentiveness of the employees. They really made us feel welcome. We will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend Maria's.  Went based on Yelp and now it's going to be a staple for our visits.  The fry bread is outstanding."}
{"text":"Really, really good prices and huge portions. Their food was the closest I've had to real Mexican food in all of the US. Service was great too with a smile.very affable owner,"}
{"text":"This was a really great place to stop by at. The service was unbelievably good and everything was made right and absolutely delicious. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Bookmarked this place based on fellow Yelper endorsements, stopped here on way to airport and sure glad I did. It's a tiny little place that's hidden in a strip mall. I'm a huge Mexican food aficionado and was very intrigued by the frybread concoctions (never had frybread before I came here). This place made me so happy - clean, friendly, fast service, with tasty frybread covered in green chili beef in beans with several hot sauces to choose from and fresh guac. Man, that was good."}
{"text":"Maria's Frybread and Mexican Food is TOPS!  I ordered a bowl of piping hot Pozole, a plain frybread, a green tamale and a red tamale with an iced horchata to wash it all down.  This place CANNOT be beaten for taste, value and service!  Next time I am back up from Texas, I will be visiting again on an empty stomach but will certainly leave satisfied!  Thanks, Maria's!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Walk in and introduced with a smile. I can see Maria or someone that looks like Maria!! Lol. Making amazing Frybread. Green Chile was delicious. Salsa was delicious! Will be back."}
{"text":"Loved the mini tacos. More of a takeout place but there is some good picnic tables and even inside tables of you prefer it."}
{"text":"My green chili fry bread was very good, but others had the menudo and didn't care for it. Tamales are mostly masa and not enough other good stuff. Very small place but clean enough and affordable."}
{"text":"We were lucky enough to find Maria's while looking for lunch. The place is small, but very clean. The family working could not be friendlier. We of course tried the Fry Bread and Pozole. Was fantastic. I also tried the Green Chili Burrito and excellent. The home made chips were a hit as well. This place is going to be a huge success I hope."}
{"text":"Generous serving , fresh, well flavored open fry bread was a pleasant surprise.  I'll happily be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"I was driving by and saw \"fry bread\" and had to stop. This place is a piece of gold!! The fry bread is delicious and fresh. The service is absolutely a plus; everyone is very friendly. This place will definitely be my new lunch/dinner spot!"}
{"text":"I'm an addict when it comes to frybread and I must say this place is amazing! The staff is friendly, food comes out quick and it's always delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what's better, the food or the service. The frybread is fantastic and the people are always very friendly. We make this a regular stop about once a week. They're a little hard to find but SO worth the search!!"}
{"text":"A plus service by a wonderful Mexican family.  Don't forget to have dessert, it is the best part."}
{"text":"Fast service, hot flavorful food. You must give this hidden jem a try. If you like fry bread, this is the real thing!"}
{"text":"First time here. The guy was very friendly and their cucumber water was delicious after our hike on Camelback Ridge. Gonna try the menudo. 5 stars based on feeling of service and the water!!"}
{"text":"Super bomb! The staff is always so friendly and have never gotten food that was below excellent."}
{"text":"First time here and I'll be back. Had the frybread with green chilli, and it was excellent. Also the horchata is very good. 
 
It is a bit hard to find, it's where two hippies burger joint was."}
{"text":"As we drove into Phoenix we decided we needed a breakfast burrito and to our delight ended up at Maria's Frybread!! (We found this place on Yelp!) my husband had the green chilies and egg and I had the chorizo and egg. Both delicious! Carlos served us and was very friendly!! He gave us some samples. We can't wait to return and since we visit Phoenix often, it will be soon!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious! Their frybread is the best Ive ever had, their tamales... YUM, and there is nothing like their homemade chips! And as if that wasn't enough, their service is tremendously stellar!!! I love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"We have since moved away but this was my favorite breakfast burrito location since it opened.  You can tell by the other reviews that it is just freaking amazing.  Even their plane chips and retried beans are good.  The owner is awesome ( from what I remember his mom is Maria).  Wish I still lived closer because I crave their red salsa and burritos."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding. .... nice people and great foods .... I was amazed on how the food was.... if you like Mexican food. ..you have to try this place .... you will love it ..."}
{"text":"I couldn't wait to try Maria's because of all the great reviews.  

I was super hungry so my stomach was up to the task of trying several different dishes.  I ordered a sopapilla (aka frybread) with chicken and red sauce.  I also ordered a chicken taco along with chips and salsa.  The food was fresh and tasty but did not live up to the 4 and 5 star hype.  My primary is that the food was relatively bland.  

The service is super quick and friendly.   Everyone working there was super nice."}
{"text":"Wow, what a great find on Yelp!  Casual Mexican drive through restaurant that's very clean inside. Service was great too but the place is very small inside. They're specialty is the green chili fry bread combo and it's everything they say it is. I came here planning on only eating half but it was so good I could not resist. Great for lunch & dinner and they even serve breakfast. I recommend checking this place out the next time your in the area."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!

We both got the sopapillas (fry bread really) with meat/beans, lettuce, tomato, and cheese. They are generous with the toppings, so much so that we ate half of ours and are taking home the rest. We also ordered a plain one to have for dessert later, definitely looking forward to that. They also brought out fresh chips, still warm, really delicious. Can't wait to eat here again!

The service is super friendly. My wife went here last week for her bday lunch and they surprised her with a dessert fry bread when they overheard about her birthday. They were so great today too when we just stopped for lunch. Really just excellent service, and so fast! I ordered, went to the bathroom, and the food came out as I sat down. Less than five minutes, tops. 

There's a small room in back that looks like it's for parties or groups, fountain drinks and bottled drinks from a fridge, and tables on the patio if you want to eat outside. The bathroom was clean and well kept. It's a fairly small place but obviously well taken care of. It's really inexpensive, which makes my very frugal wife incredibly happy. Yet another reason we have been here twice in the past month, and will likely be back quite soon"}
{"text":"Ordered the carne asada sopapillia and it was really good. Nice portion size and filled me up. Love the atmosphere and the staff is really nice. You can tell they take pride in their food. They check up on their guest more then any other place I have been too which I like. Love the drive through window design."}
{"text":"The pozole was sooooo tasty.  I also tried the green chile beef with rice beans and a tortilla, and it was very good.  I always get wary about green chile that uses beef instead of pork, but this beef was very tender and the sauce was good.  Their horchata was very yummy, not overly sweet, and it was a good price.  I loved the totopos and the salsas.  They were excellent.

A lot of people mentioned the service. The people who work there are super nice.

Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Love this place... I recently found this hidden gem. They have tasty fry bread & great people!"}
{"text":"\"All of THAT ...and a bag of chips\"!!
This place ROCKS!!!
Deliciousness and super friendly!!!
HIGHLY recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is a national treasure. Frybread with green chili is amazing. Like the red chili too but nothing beats this green chili. One frybread is a huge portion. Frybread taco also a good item to order. Chips are fine and great salsa selection. This place is ridic."}
{"text":"Maria, you make a mighty tasty frybread!

This restaurant is pretty small with a few tables in the front with a few more in a back room. There are also two tables outside. 

The menu consists of Mexican food such as tacos, tamales, and burritos as well as the famed frybread. I had a vegetarian frybread with beans, tomatoes, lettuce, cheese, onions with a side of guacamole and a horchata. 

The frybread was perfect. It was just the right amount of light crispness, not too doughy, with a slight amount of chew. The toppings in the frybread were fresh and went well together. The side of guacamole was a good portion to go with my meal. 

The meal came with a selection of salsa/hot sauce and chips. The chips were thick and crispy. I loved the 3 different bottles of hot sauce/salsa (Red, green, chipotle). They aren't afraid to pack a spicy punch! I made my frybread XMas style putting both green and red sauce on it for maximum deliciousness!

The horchata was freshly made, light and sweet. It had too much of a powdery taste for me though.

Service was fast and friendly. The total for my meal was a little less than $12.

I'd love to come back here again for more of that delectable frybread! 

4.5/5"}
{"text":"Heard from several people we have to try this place so we did today. It is AWESOME. What a cute little spot with an incredible family staff. So nice and so happy to have you in their restaurant. Then the food GREAT. Big big portions. And very reasonable. This is our new favorite Mexican spot"}
{"text":"Good As It Gets when it comes to fry bread, fresh food, friendly staff, I will definitely be going back.  Menu is Affordable and the portions are large."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food!!!! The portions served are big and well worth it. Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy!!!!  The green chili here is AMAZEBALLS!  We ordered fry bread with green chili, no refried beans (normally comes with it).  The green chili was the best I've had in the valley and the fry bread was cooked to perfection.  We also had a bean and cheese fry bread and it was great too.  The folks here took great care of us.  I tried the enchiladas too and they were tasty.  I want to come back and try new things.  Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"I would eat here weekly if I lived here! Stopped in for lunch after golfing at Papago. The great reviews didn't disappoint. The service was awesome and the portions plenty. The beef chimichanga was too die for."}
{"text":"Every once and a while I get this crazy craving for fry bread with hot sauce... and by golly, thank god this place came along. It is kinda hard to find, it's behind a pet store in the corner of an old strip mall. I always get the same thing, fry bread with half red and half green sauce. The salsa they put on top is also delicious! I think they have 3 different salsas now, but the green is my personal favorite. They have a drive-thru, so you don't even have to put shoes on... it's a win-win"}
{"text":"I wish there were more than 5 stars available . Run , don't walk to this place ... and now !! This food is phenomenal. I ordered the green chili taco , my husband the carne open faced taco . Absolutely mouth-watering. The best meal we had in Phoenix . The service was super friendly and helpful . When we ordered a sweet fry bread with our meal , they continued to see where we were in our meal before bringing the sweet bread so that it would be hot . My only sadness is we live in Georgia and so far from this wonderful place and amazing food . Well done Maria's !!!!"}
{"text":"Oh my lord this place is legit amaze balls!!! And very good with price with a high hilarity of tasting food !!! I'm so stuffed their sopapillas  are amazing"}
{"text":"10 lbs later, I am food drunk from the Indian taco (ground beef) and menudo. Super quick with great customer service. Overall it's a happy experience."}
{"text":"So so Good!!! Best pozole ever here! Comes with all the yummy fixings too! We had the fry bread with green chili beef and that was excellent too, not too spicy at all if that kind of thing bothers you, the fry bread was perfect. Not too thick and salted just right. The best part was the hospitality and customer service though, we had just gone to the zoo and saw it was close so we decided to try it. When we walked in they made us feel like a regular and family! It's a drive for us as we live in Surprise but I can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Excellent!!! Love love love the tacos!! They have ground beef at this location which I was super excited about since most only have Carne"}
{"text":"A winning combination of great food and excellent customer service!  My father and I each had a Machaca burrito and the manager let us sample the green chile pork.  Everything was delicious.  I will be back.  I did not even try the food item in the name of the restaurant and was still pleased.  Great work people!"}
{"text":"Personable and fun service and somehow even better food. Comfortable and clean interior. Also, the hot sauce is wonderful."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service as soon as you walk in, speedy service and excellent food. It's a must try place for sure."}
{"text":"I've been sorely remiss in not elevating Maria's to 5 stars.  Well over 16 documented visits later, I can say that each time I am greeted cordially, and treated cordially and shown that my patronage is appreciated.  

My meals here have always been outstanding - if you consider that I only order Green-Chile Frybread and Crispy shredded beef tacos.  Absolutely zero complaints.

One comment though, my wife tried their version of \"Super-Nachos\".  We agreed that they need to go back and re-think this dish.  I would not recommend ordering it until they do.  It's just not right."}
{"text":"By far one of the best places to eat in phoenix, my wife & I are in love with the pozole. The service is always genuine and they always go above and beyond in the way they provide service. One time my wife and I were waiting behind the first car in line and one of the workers came out and took our order in are car window. Big portions for your money, Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"We came for the fry bread, which was great, but really fell in love with the salsas. Both the red and the green salsas are excellent... and different from most other places in town. Lots of flavor and just the right amount of kick. Even though Maria's isn't close to home (we came here because we picked up a friend from the airport), we'll definitely be back. Oh... the staff was super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch spots! By far the best fry bread I've ever had! It tastes just like my grandma's! The staff is always so friendly too."}
{"text":"I had been searching for non-dessert sopapilla for 27 years and this place surpassed my expectations!"}
{"text":"Friendly service with fast, delicious food. Our party opted for the open-faced fry bread concoction that is pictured prominently on the wall, and it did not disappoint. There were many choices of meat on this unique, tostada-esque creation. Shredded beef wins my vote for yummiest. We also enjoyed the red and green sauces served with our chips. This is a great little lunch spot. Wish I lived closer to go back regularly."}
{"text":"Maria's Frybread has the best menudo and pozole!  I've had just about everything on the menu and it's all great, but when I'm craving soups, this is the spot!!  The family that owns this place always welcome you with kindness and go above and beyond to make sure you enjoy their food and restaurant.  I hope this place stays open for decades to come!!"}
{"text":"Take this place for what it is: a quick place to pop in and eat some pretty good good. This interior is really adorable. The staff was very nice, and prices were right.

The food isn't amazing, but it's solid. I'd go back if we ever stopped in Phoenix again. We left happy and with plenty of leftovers."}
{"text":"Really wanted to try Frybread while visiting AZ and this place delivered! The food was delicious and a lot for a great price! The Frybread was everything I wanted it to be! They services was great, very friendly!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and service phenomenal! Very friendly indeed. The Fry bread is delicious and so are the refried beans and the cheese enchiladas are awesome too."}
{"text":"Fry Bread was good.  Little too much lettuce.  I'll know better for next time.   Fruitfrescas were amazing.  I'm sure we will be back."}
{"text":"Thanks Yelpers, your colorful reviews brought me here and I was not disappointed!

There is something incredibly magical about fried bread. Maria's fry bread is delicious. I could snack on this bread all day be perfectly satisfied, and not at all ashamed. *giggles*

The small restaurant has dine-in seating at a few tables and even a drive-up window.

I was thrilled to get soda from Mexico. There is a more intense taste. I normally buy Mexican Cokes, Maria's also carries orange Fanta. I ordered it and gulped down the entire soda.

I also enjoyed the taco with ground beef and a dessert fry bread to go.
The dessert fry bread reminds me of an elephant ear from a fair. It comes with honey, cinnamon sugar, and powdered sugar. YUM! My order was right around $15.

The staff is friendly and accomodating. There is plenty to choose from on the menu. I can see why this place is a favorite of local Yelpers and travelers."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat in Phoenix...and I live here. Nicest people working there and the service is so fast it would make a fast food joint jealous, yet the don't skimp out on the quantity or quality of food. You will leave full and happy I guarantee"}
{"text":"This place was soooo good!!!! Not only that, the service was great.  Carlos and the sweet girl working made the experience even better.  I would highly recommend this wonderful place!"}
{"text":"Maria's Frybread & Mexican Food was the first place that I bookmarked when I was planning my trip to Scottsdale. Located in Phoenix, this tiny hole in the wall restaurant has impressive stats: 300+ reviews averaging 4.5 stars. BAM!!

We were greeted right away by a very nice gentleman when we walked in. It took us a while to peruse the simple menu posted by the register. The worker explained patiently and even gave recommendations. Thank you!

Green chili frybread taco ($7.49): I was picturing crispy shell and I was a little disappointed for a second when I took a bite of the chewy frybread. It's not bad, but I was expecting a crispy taco shell. My bad! 

The green chili was amazing. The world stopped for a second and I was immediately transformed into my childhood, which was weird because I never had green chili when I was little. The worker asked how I was doing and I couldn't really answer her. The juicy pork nuggets were bursting with flavors. The sauce was perfect. 

Carne asada frybread taco ($7.49): I took a bite of the carne asada and it was just okay.

The service was fast, helpful and attentive.

4 stars!!

Maria's Frybread & Mexican Food is yummylicious!!"}
{"text":"Since we have moved to Arizona we have tried menudo from various locations and this place is simply AMAZING!! The cinnamon fey bread was also amazing. We also love the fact this place is family owned and the level of service was on point! This will be our new spot. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I've only been here once but I already want to go back for more enchiladas. We arrived with 6 adults and four kids and they quickly offered us the giant table in the back where we all sat comfortably. Ordering was easy and those of us that had a hard time ordering because of the enormous selection were still able to order due to the friendly staff who allowed us to take our time while we talk about the menu."}
{"text":"Best fry bread in Phoenix! This is a great restaurant with fast, friendly service and Mexican food done right! Every time I have been there I feel very welcome. 

The owner is very friendly and always has a smile on his face, you can honestly tell that he is thankful for each and every one of his customers. The food always comes out very fast and the quality is amazing for what you pay!

I will be a loyal patron of this restaurant whenever I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Best fry bread I have every had. I had the Chile verde! They have a really friendly staff. Great place! Go there now"}
{"text":"Items Selected:
Tortillas and 3 Salsas
Bean and Green Chili Tostada
Carne Asada Fry Bread Taco with Beans, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Cheese, Red Chili, Green Chili
Sopapilla with Cinnamon, Powdered Sugar, Honey

Doing a poor job of investigating Phoenix's diverse Mexican dining scene during a short residence, the variety of fare and region-specific styles truly impressive in retrospect, it was to Maria's Fry Bread and Mexican Food that the GPS was directed on Friday afternoon, the family-owned restaurant on East Thomas proving to be as good as rumors suggested.

Open for just under one year, the lack of a website or answered-phones making the storefront with a Drive-Thru the sort of place best visited without a lot of research, it was half-passed one that a party of three entered the former Burger Joint, an expectedly ethnic décor speckled by oddities such as octopus vases on the counter or Barbie and Ken on a swing hanging from the wall.

Dining with Spanish-speakers, though the staff was English-fluent, it was after brief perusal of a short menu that an order was placed, one large Horchata in a Styrofoam cup presented with complimentary Chips and three housemade Salsas ranging from mild Tomatillo to what the server described as \"inedible hot.\"

Waiting mere moments for plates from the kitchen, a few other diners previously present enjoying their Food, it was with all three plates presented at once that the small table was flooded, first bites of a crispy Tostada with refried Beans and Green Chili impressive in the range of its flavor and downright irresistible to a friend who reminisced of where she had previously experienced the smooth yet spicy taste.

Moving on to two Fry Breads, the word Sopapilla used to describe a plain disc served with Honey, Cinnamon and Confectioner's Sugar meant to be dressed to taste, the second selection was served folded with the puffy Shell light and virtually oilless around tender house-braised Beef plus bright vegetal flavors , Beans and Cheese."}
{"text":"THE BEST TACO I'VE EVER HAD!!! Green Chile was delectable, sopapilla was very authentic according to my New Mexican background. My picky kids loved the beans. Definitely recommend this!! Absolutely delicious. Servers were so attentive."}
{"text":"Second visit here and it will be my last not sure if it's new staff or what but my order was butchered like no other and the customer service was horrible and the employees lack the training to take orders and process the order and payment and mind you it was a 4 item order still got it wrong"}
{"text":"This place will probably get a negative review soon from someone just trying to leak the air out of their balloon but it won't be from me. 

We stopped by during the rains of Phoenix and got a ton of food for less than $20 - a frybread pizza (okay, that's what I call it) and three stuffed tacos (two chicken and one shredded beef). Everything is fresh and the salsas are great, especially the hot one in the small yellow container. Chips are hot and small (like a Tijuana surprise) and the guys running the place are the real deal - grateful you came in and proud of their food. 

Positive on all points - I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Nice place! Extremely sweet employees and some very fast service! We had fried bread taco. It was so awesome!! Tender meat and well seasoned refried beans."}
{"text":"We are recent transplants from New Mexico, and this is the closest to true New Mexican we have found. Their red chile is the star, as the green chile sauce has more beans and meat than chile. The sopapillas were incredibly fresh, and the service was  phenomenal. We asked for a lot of extras and sides, and they were accommodating at every turn. We will definitely be back, but if you are looking for a place that mimics Sadie's this isn't quite that."}
{"text":"One word.... posole!  If you know what it is get over there and order it.  If you don't know, get going now and try it you won't regret it.  The Indian fry bread with green chile was great.  Honest homemade food with tons of flavor."}
{"text":"Wow!!! We decided to try this place out because of the number of reviews and all being 5 stars. It's a mom and pap place, not what I expected for a dinning area but they accommodating, moved tables together and even served us at our table. The chips were home made, had the perfect amount of salt and oh so very yummy. There were 3 different types of salsa and even there mildest has a little bit of a bit. I ordered the beef tacos, the food came out quickly and there rice and beans were the best I've ever had. The staff was friendly and polite. I wish this place was closer to our house because it is worth going back to and would become a new favorite. Wow!!! Totally worth its 5 stars!"}
{"text":"This place is so freaking good. Everyone is so nice especially Carlos and the food is amazing! I got the bean tostadas and they were the best ever. This is the best place to get Mexican food from! Never going back to Chipotle after eating here."}
{"text":"Great food and the service to match.  The shredded beef tacos & enchiladas are my favorite so far still a few things left on the menu to sample.  Stopped by here a couple months ago and they moved to the top of the list.  Also has a convenient drive thru."}
{"text":"I love frybread, so if I see a sign that says FryBread then I have to try it and I'm glad I did. This place has such great customer service from the moment you walk in and the frybread taco itself was amazing! Good portion, good seasoning and spice and a perfect crispy, fluffy frybread. This is a must try at a  good price too! Go check them out people!! They even have a drive thru..oh and free yummy tortilla chips!"}
{"text":"Oh wow. I read all of the Yelp reviews and decided to check this place out. Service was super friendly and the fry bread was amazing! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time here with my daughter and we love it!!! Friendly service and the FOOD is amazing their fry bread is amazing!!!!!!!!!!! Thanks!"}
{"text":"This place is really great! Delicious food and really good, friendly service. I had a bean burrito enchilada style, and it was super good. Also I really enjoyed the chips and variety of salsas they have. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Maria's Frybread & Mexican Food is a family affair. You'll see Maria in the kitchen and her son Alfredo at the counter. They are so nice that you might be inclined to award five stars just based on likeability but there's no need. Maria's prior 26 years in the kitchen are on full display. Open only eleven weeks, this tiny restaurant is well on its way to becoming a huge success story. 

I haven't had a chance to sample the full menu as of yet, but I intend to over the next few months. A simple chicken taco? Served with white chicken breast meat. Sold! Some of their most popular items are the Frybread Tacos and, of course, the Sopapillas. No bulk processed microwaved refried beans to be found here. They're made fresh on the premises, as is all the food.

The dining room is very small, but there is a small overflow dining room in the back of the restaurant. There are also some orange picnic tables out front, remnants of the Two Hippies business that formerly occupied the space. Maria's doesn't mind your pooch joining you at these tables, but the landlord apparently does, having posted a \"no pets allowed\" sign back in the Two Hippies era. Dog friendly? Perhaps. You tell me. There is also a drive thru. You'll be rewarded for stepping inside, however, with fresh homemade chips and red and green salsa. There is no kids menu per se, but they will make scaled down versions of some items upon request. Just ask.

importantly, they are listening to their customers and still actively making improvements. They're planning on adding some more vegetarian options and perhaps gluten free items, no easy feat in Mexican cuisine. They're also thinking about extending their hours. And the candy under the counter? Added for nearby high school students who drop in. I suspect they're going to need a bigger dining room!

What impressed me most is when Alfredo approached me on my first visit. \"I don't think I've seen you before...\" A ten minute discussion about his mom and the restaurant ensued. A few days later, when I visited again, he called me by name. Did I say impressive? I can easily see why Maria's has a five star average on Yelp."}
{"text":"Great Indian taco and so very accommodating to their customers. This is the best choice for folks wanting an authentic Indian taco.
The drive thru window is so wonderful for those of us being lazy on the weekend.
Great portion size and just an overall fulfilling experience."}
{"text":"OMG.  The Frybread with green chili!!!!! Great prices, really nice people, great food!"}
{"text":"Incredible! This was a perfect mixture of beans, cheese, salsa etc on the most delicious frybread. We had to return before our flight home and the cinnamon and sugar frybread for breakfast did not disappoint!  Wish we could bring this restaurant and the sweet people home to Georgia."}
{"text":"Love, love, LOVE this place. Can't tell you which salsa is the best because they are all awesome and I order depending on my mood. The flat, fry bread is so yummy. Even without anything on it, just with sugar it is so damn tasty. the guy who runs the register is so sweet and attentive. 5 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"Such a cute little spot! Hidden behind the Pet Club, it features a drive through and a cozy dining space. The interior is clean and colorful. 

They give you fresh chips and yummy homemade salsas to start. I had a shredded beef burrito with rice and beans and my husband had the red chile beef burrito. The red chile sauce was SO good, with super rich, deep flavors. I also got an horchata because I'm a sucker for them, and it was delectable. 

We'll definitely be back! I have to try the fry bread!"}
{"text":"Went here to get breakfast burritos for work and it has been closed by the Health Department :/"}
{"text":"Fantastic sopapillas and fry bread tacos. The location is tucked behind the Pet Club, so at first it was difficult to find. We had the frybread tacos, one shredded beef and one carne asada. Each one is plenty of food for one person. The owner offered us a complimentary plain sopapilla (open frybread) which is served with cinnamon, powdered sugar and honey. We were stuffed but couldn't turn it down. It did not disappoint! We ate every bit. The service was incredibly quick with just the right amount of friendliness and checking on us, without being overbearing. We will definitely return and recommend it to our friends!"}
{"text":"Good red chili fry bread and Mexican food and great customer service - will definitely visit again while in the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"This is a \"must try at least once in your lifetime\" sort of place. The food was incredibly amazing and the service was top notch!! Delish!!!  The best menudo I've ever had and believe me, I've had lots of it....the frybread was delicious...superb all around!! Did I mention that the prices were awesome too? 22 bucks for 3 entrees and 2 drinks....can't beat that."}
{"text":"There are a few reasons there is over 140 reviews and a 5 star rating for this place. The service is FAST, and friendly. The fry bread is phenomenal. The enchiladas come in a plate-bowl (I'm sure someone has a better, real description for this. I'm going to stick with plate-bowl), drowning in beans and sauce. Yum! I was confused at first why there are bottles of salsa on the table and the chips are delivered with no bowl for the salsa. Solution? Add salsa to food. Eat food. Use chips for the remains. Perfection.

Tip from the hubby: Upon arrival at a new place, ask the employees \"what's going to rock my world\", or \"what will change my life\". The excitement to share their personal favorite dish with you is validated during your meal. He does this every time, and we are rarely disappointed."}
{"text":"I had the fry bread taco with red chile beef.  It had a good flavor to it.  A warning that it is quite large.  I went for lunch and likely won't be able to eat anything for dinner tonight."}
{"text":"What a wonderful welcome from AZ!  Flew in from MN and we were looking to start out our big family trip here with some local fare and we certainly found it.  It's not easy finding a place where all six of us are thrilled but Maria's Frybread happened to be one.  The service and hospitality were also A++; food always tastes better with great company.  

We tried a variety; big burrito, cheese enchiladas, chicken and green chile enchiladas, a couple different frybreads of course, the tomales and finished with a fresh hot frybread that we put honey and cinnamon sugar on for dessert.   All was fantastic and we had plenty of leftovers for the next day.

Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Only gave one star because I had to. Sopa. are not native Indian frybread. Totally different flavors. Some people will just eat anything."}
{"text":"Just love to try little local places like this.  We ordered two of the frybread tacos with the green chili sauce.  It was very, very good.  a couple of orange sodas to go with it.  Just what was needed after multiple hotel meals and conference buffets.

The place is not big.  few tables in the front and a few in the back.  We sat outside, and it was a wonderful evening.

Highly recommend this place.  Nice friendly people and a great local food."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times before thought I grab some Indian fried bread with green chili. Has a little bit of kick to it on the spicy side. Reminds me of a tostada but fluffier. It's the best Indian fried bread places I love to go to."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood mex restaurant. Really good enchiladas, hominy, etc. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I love Fry Bread and was not disappointed. They have great chili and the fry bread is soft and cooked just right. Not chewy. The red chili is excellent and the green chili is made with Hatch Green chili pods. That's the best green chili out there. It's definitely not that nasty tomatillo sauce from Texas. I ordered an omelette with green chili and beans. My friend ordered the red chili. We had the fry bread on the side like a tortilla. Great stuff."}
{"text":"Really really love this place! Great mexican food and AMAZING fry bread. You can get it savory with meat or plain with powdered sugar, cinnamon sugar and honey. On top of the great food, the guys that work there, truly know customer service. They are extremely friendly and ask if you need anything multiple times during your visit. You can't even get this kind of service at actual restaurants. If you love Mexican food and fry bread, you won't regret coming here!"}
{"text":"This was a great find! Little corner of a strip center, with a drive thru.
Went inside, friendly greeting at counter. Very nice young lady took order of green chili fry bread, then brought it to table in just a few minutes. Food was delicious. Fry bread not at all greasy.
Place is neat and clean, floor being mopped continuously, and tables cleared.
It's so nice to eat good food at a family business that really, seriously, gives a hoot about their customers.
Wish they were closer.
I highly recommend giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place. I ate what I would call a Navajo Taco. I wish I lived closer. Courteous customer service. Delicious green chili, and the sopapilla with honey was so delicious. I couldn't eat it all. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Best authentic,  flavorful food we've had. Maria is still the owner and cook,  had the enchilada burrito and pork green chili tostada.  Even the homemade 3 Levels of heat salsas and homemade tortilla chips are delicious.  Friendly and fantastic food. Highly recommended this local restaurant.  Thanks Maria."}
{"text":"I drive past this place every week going to church and decided to check it out. Happy I did. It was so good. The service is unreal. I've been back several times now and I've received great service every time. Food is very good and flavorful. One of my new favorite places."}
{"text":"This food is very good, it comes out superquick. The people are very nice and it has a drive-through. We got the corn tamales green corn and shredded beef regular tamale, they were awesome. We also got various fry bread, so good"}
{"text":"Best pozole and green chile bean tostadas ever! I love this place. I have been here twice now with different family members, all fans now! Wonderful service, incredible food, huge portions, amazing prices. You can tell the food is made with love :). I will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"I was in the area and decided to give this place a shot. You can dine in the small shop or drive up to the takeout window, which is literally a sliding window on the far end of the tiny dining area near the counter and kitchen.   

To me, the food was just ok. I tried the frybread taco which came with either green or red chili served on top. They offered me a sample of each and I opted for the green, less spicy chili. Not many toppings were served on the taco, mostly lettuce some cheese and a few tomato sprinkles. Came served with a few different salsas in squeeze bottles, the kind you usually see ketchup and mustard served out of in other restaurants. 

I will say the service was really great. Very friendly staff. When I told them I had my own water they even offered me a cup with ice so that it was nice and cold. Super sweet and seemed like it may be family owned with the mom cooking in the back and father/daughter working the front area. Who knows if that's the case but they also seemed to know their customers personally and took time to make sure everyone felt welcome."}
{"text":"Small place hidden in the west corner of the shopping plaza.

Tried their Green Chili Frybread and the Carna Asada Frybread which both were very good.

The Green Chili has a slight kick but not to spicy and the carna Asada is solid.

The funny thing is the Frybread is the same thing as the sopapilla except the sopapilla is open faced and the Frybread is folded and the sopapilla is one dollar more.

The Frybread is not as fluffy as I am used to and a little bit more firm, which is not a negative,  but just different. I did like the crunchy texture of the frybread. 

One thing I have to note is this is a small family owned restaurant and the people there have exceptional customer service,  they must have asked us 3 or more times if we needed anything else and even gave us a plain sopapilla to try with honey and powdered sugar. Super nice people and a different way to eat besides the old burger and pizza lunch."}
{"text":"3 - stars is because....I believe that it's a great place for whoever does not know authentic Mexican food.  I was not impressed with the food...I saw the 5-stars on Yelp and thought that I was going to have my Pozole with Pata, cabage, tostadas, etc etc...My husband's menudo tasted like the one that comes in a can.  I was hoping for freshly made tortillas, it was from El Super market...and wrapped in foil.  :/

5- stars for customer service...everyone there was very polite."}
{"text":"My husband doesn't like Mexican food. When we visited Phoenix, I persuaded him to try Mexican food there and I found this place. And HE LOVES IT!!! I think no more words are needed."}
{"text":"We are visiting Arizona from Texas for a wedding. My husband and I have made a habit of seeking out fry bread when visiting New Mexico. So when we decided to come to Phoenix/Tempe, we thought we'd see if fry bread was a thing here. We found this place through a Google search and it had great reviews. First off, the restaurant and bathroom alike were very clean. It's not a huge restaurant, but it was busy. We were quickly served and our food arrived very quickly. The server was very friendly as well. We had the sopapilla with ground beef, beans and cheese. Definitely worth a visit for tourists and locals alike!"}
{"text":"Wonderful fry bread and wonderful staff. Came from San Francisco to find fry bread and could not be more pleased."}
