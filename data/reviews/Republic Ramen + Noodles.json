{"text":"This place is phenomenal. I had my first visit around Halloween and have been back weekly ever since. I'm a huge fan of Kim Chee and these folks have nailed it. The coffees and teas they have next door are extremely good as well. I usually will take some back to the office after lunch. 

Living in NYC, I used to love to hit St Mark's and enjoy some good ramen. I figured I had lost that opportunity upon moving here, but thanks to Republic, I\"m back in business. Keep up the good food, I'll see you guys next week!"}
{"text":"Tried the spicy ramen with egg and beef.  I lived in Tokyo and I have tried many different types of ramen.  I didn't have high expectations but I thought it was good.  I will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"I was in line to order when I heard the counter person insulting a customer. 
 I never had seen such poor customer service in my life and rude people yelling and eating,
 I will not be back I bet ramen in the package is just as good."}
{"text":"I'm going to keep this short and sweet. I ordered miso ramen and they gave me shoyu. I immediately knew that it wasn't miso because it lacked miso's distinct foggy hue and traces of fermented bean paste.  I have grown accustomed to the unique look of miso broth after having lived in Chiba/Tokyo for 3 years.

When I took my bowl to the service counter, the attending chef told me that because their miso has no MSG, it isn't as potent as \"regular\" miso. I have had MANY types of miso, and none of them taste like bland greasy salt water. Rather than own up to his mistake, the chef lied to my face. To make the situation worse, as I left the restaurant I saw a fellow customer enjoying genuine miso broth ramen."}
{"text":"This place is hands down the best place I have been to in AZ for ramen. I used to go to Hawaii quite a bit and I loved the Ramen Houses there. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The customer service was terrible. When ordering, I told the cashier that this was my first time here and I knew of the restaurant from a flyer I read at work. I proceeded to ask the cashier what he would recommend. The cashier spoke in an extremely quiet voice , could barely hear him and he could not answer my question. As this was going on, I had noticed dirty tables all over the restaurant. Dirty dishes everywhere. I still continued with my order because the menu looked so delicious and I had planned on eating there for lunch and the place was busy. I ate outside because of all the empty dirty tables. It took 15 minutes , maybe a lil longer to be served my order. I wasn't even served , I actually had to go back to cashier and ask for my order. Honestly, the food was not worth all the poor customer service. I gave the restaurant a chance and I feel it was a waste of my time and money. I will never go back."}
{"text":"Where to start...

I used to like this place a lot and I came here often. Not sure if they changed management, but the place no longer has coupons anywhere so it's extremely overpriced. Don't be fooled by the $2 gyoza dumplings; they're the size of a quarter and there's only 3. Also, if the girl asks you if you want garlic, say no because she doesn't tell you that it's 50 cents extra and you'll never taste the difference. 

The flavor of the broth is good, decent portion sizes. It's better to order without meat, because I've tried all their meats and they're all pretty terrible, dry, and tough. Their chicken is actually kind of gross. Even though ramen is supposed to have a lot of toppings, only order toppings if you want to spend over 10 dollars for a bowl of noodles because each one is about $1, and they're not very good and in small portions.

Their tempura is pretty good and the best deal on the menu is the udon with tempura. Their boba is pretty good for Arizona.

However, I have some issues with their customer service, the last two times I've been they've over charged me by adding things like eggs that I didn't want and then would not take it off my charge. Their staff is pretty rude in general, so I probably won't go back because I seriously value an overall experience.

A little disappointing because it is in a great location and there aren't many ramen places around."}
{"text":"In reality more like a 3.5 stars. I've been by this place many times and I was finally able to give it a go. Rather than ramble on about ambiance, the service, the location I'll cut right to what matters: the food. I'm a vegetarian and as such I accept that my dining options are not as vast as those with unrestricted diets. However, Asian cuisine is generally very veg friendly and as such I dine at Asian restaurants probably more than any other type of restaurant. Unfortunately, Republic Ramen falls a touch short of what I'd call \"Veg Friendly\". The only option you'll have is the Vegetarian Ramen, which is OK because that is what I came in there for. And while the ramen was good (very rich, salty and tons of toppings) one dining option is not enough to make me a regular. It would be nice to try, say some udon noodles or an appetizer that isn't edamame.

Again, the ramen is good. And the price is fair. But would it really be so bad to leave the fish sauce out of a dish or two? Or to try using a vegetarian dashi instead of a fish-based dashi?"}
{"text":"I don't normally eat Japanese food so I can't compare, but I thought it was pretty good! At first I thought 10 bucks for a bowl of some ramen noodles was crazy but when I saw how big the damn bowl was, I was satisfied. They have a lot of different bowls to choose from as well as toppings to add which definitly gives me a reason to come back."}
{"text":"The ramen isn't amazing by any means, but it's pretty decent. Good fix to satisfy your ramen cravings!"}
{"text":"A solid three stars, I think! No, it's NOT the authentic Hakata-style ramen I crave but it's not the 25cent kind either! The noodles are REALLY well done and the broths (tonkatsu, spicy tonkatsu and the shoyu) were very tasty and full of flavor. The toppings in the traditional style leave a lot to be desired and the pork is NOT chashu-style.

The boba drinks are nice and the service was pretty good. Overall, I'd give them another try."}
{"text":"Average ramen but is already enough for a near school ramen restaurant. The spicy oil and power are very good. I prefer the traditional style"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. I always order ahead and go pick up the food so I can take it back to a quiet spot and watch tv during lunchtime, and they always have my order ready when I get there.

One thing you should know: the portions are HHHUUUUUUGGGGGEEE. You probably won't be able to finish all of it. So when you're choosing add-ons like eggs (I like their eggs!), keep in mind that the bowl is already ginormous."}
{"text":"My least favorite ramen place. I'm just spoiled by really good ramen in my home town of Portland."}
{"text":"Visited a boy at ASU, and he recommended this place. I wasn't disappointing, this place was awesome! I tried the Vegetarian Ramen, and it was meatless, and wonderful. Much like me after my cleanse. 

I would totally go there again.. I guess it depends on if I see this boy again. :)"}
{"text":"This place used to be good, but they seem to have fallen off. I will not be going back. The bathroom and kitchen looked like they haven't been cleaned in weeks. This place needs to be inspected."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  The Tonkastu ramen is our favorite.  It is very tasty.  After leaving San Francisco, we missed having ramen.  We were very happy when we found this place.  The decor is very nice.  The staff is awesome - somehow they hire some of the nicest and helpful people out there.  The snow boba is great too."}
{"text":"ehhhhhh, i was really excited to have a ramen shop next to my house.. but honeslty i can't tell difference between their ramen and the frozen one. 
Broth is so-so, and noodles... i think they use frozen.
Their gyoza is not really worth it, neither is their fried rice. 

I guess its okay, if your craving a quick grab, but kind of expensive for not good quality ramen. 
Dose not taste ANYTHING like real ramen in Japan. 

Their boba is pretty good though =D and staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Super nice people and great customer service, but the food is not good at all.  Don't go there if you've ever had real Ramen before.  I had Miso Ramen, and the broth tasted like ginger soup with a hint of Miso.  Noddles were not Ramen noodles and overcooked, the boiled egg was an additional $1and overcooked, and had no flavor.  They use very low quality meat for Chashu, too.  Being from Japan, I'm not sure if I would call this noodle dish Ramen.  Like other reviewers mentioned, the instant Ramen from Asian markets taste better than this."}
{"text":"Visited recently with my son - an avowed ramen fan - both of us had the tonkatsu ramen. It was fantastic!  Rich, tasty broth, fresh vegetables, and the noodles were firm and delicious. The decor here is Spartan and clean, with lots of natural light from the windows.  All in all very inviting and friendly. The person who took our order was friendly and very helpful, explaining the menu and suggesting drinks. He even suggested getting a combo milk tea - almond and honeydew - a very refreshing combination. A wonderful place - head down and gives these folks business, it's definitely a restaurant worth keeping."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying this place is really affordable, but unfortunately you really get what you pay for. The noodles are okay but all of the food including the udon and ramen are way too salty. The decor makes a nice attempt at being a hip modern spot but their fans are covered in dust and the seating is extremely uncomfortable. I was stoked when I saw the prices, but overall my experience was not great. I wouldn't return for the food or the ambiance."}
{"text":"Great taste. The ramen are all good. Shrimp tempura and squid salad are especially delicious."}
{"text":"The worst ramen I tried. The udon and tempura are horrible. Soooo salty!!! And the service is horrible. Will never go here again!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place.  It is fresh, clean, and affordable.  The portions are so a friend and I can share an entree (we always get the Tonkatsu and spice it up with the Sriracha sauce) and the service is always great or exceptional.  Boba is always tasty, and I hear the special summer menu is coming...can't wait!"}
{"text":"On the East side of ASU's sprawling csmpus, Republic Ramen + Noodles is the perfect spot to cure your Mill Ave. hang over. Or stop by any time for a taste of authentic ramen bowls.

Definitely a favorite of mine to bring out of towners to. They think they are headed to an authentic taco shack and end up in a trendy little ramen spot."}
{"text":"I fucking love this place!!!!!!!! I went there 2 times in the same week because the first time was my first time ever being there and I'm so addicted now. they have spam! and i love eggs. I'm Vietnamese so i love Vietnamese food but this place is one of my favorite noodle places now, it's so bomb, sometimes I'm just hanging out and I get the taste in my mouth for it, I would go there again to make it 3 times this week. 

and yeah some people are complaining and saying \"well I've been here and here and they have way better ramen....\" but guess what? this is AZ and we only have so much here, it's not LA so you can't compare it. I don't travel as much as i like so when i find a good restaurant here i know how to appreciate it."}
{"text":"This is a very unique restaurant for the Phoenix area. Not many other restaurants doing this style of food in town. I've been here a couple times and enjoyed myself each time bringing different friends to try it out.  Highly recommended and will go there as often as I can."}
{"text":"Eh. The food is kind of bland and the staff wasn't very attentive. The only good thing there is boba tea which is probably the only reason I'll go back."}
{"text":"Pretty good and inexpensive, especially if you're willing to share a bowl (they're more than big enough for two people).

The chicken gets VERY overcooked because of the heat of the soup. I'd suggest a different meat. I also love to add corn and an egg."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!  I could there everyday no problem.  It's super inexpensive and they bring you a huge bowl, enough to feed 2, but you'll find that you continually keep eating no matter how full you are because it's so good.  The ramen has so much flavor and it's delicious with all the fresh veggies.  AND they offer Boba tea which is another bonus.  Check this place out if you're looking for something tasty and cheap."}
{"text":"Ill have to admit then place of alright.  The portions are pretty Big but I felt the noodles was a  bit over cooked.  The broth tasted decent but not very impressed.  I had the Tokyo ramen traditional style with no egg in it which I found a bit different.   Tampopo ramen is more of a traditional Japanese ramen in my opinion."}
{"text":"Their ramen wasn't authentic at all, but it did at least satisfy my ramen craving.  It seems strange to have raw spinach in the ramen....and the vegetables they put in aren't cooked at all so they're too hard and crispy and takes away from the flavor of the actual ramen.  Their boba drinks here are awesome and I'd come here just to get that if I was craving boba.  While I wish their ramen was better, I'd probably still come back here again if I was craving Ramen since it is so close to campus."}
{"text":"I haven't actually eaten my food here or eaten all of the dishes, but the ramen I have had here is extremely fucking tasty. The one problem I have is that there char siu is pretty thin. I've had ramen in a lot of countries and the standard for Japanese ramen is to cut the pork pretty thick (and throw an egg on top for bonus points). Granted I've only eaten here once but the pork was pretty thin....and I didnt hear anything about an egg. But i\"m not ging to hold that against them. They have a great location, a clean shop, and a tasty menu. Will definitely be back as soon as I can convince my work lunch buddy to take me there :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  The price is great for the amount of food.  I find myself coming back over and over - the boba is great, also.  The ambience is really nice, too, and the noodles are fresh and the broth is delicious!  Best ramen in the area, by far.  They have two different options for the toppings, which is really nice for your preference.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"DISSAPPOINTED!!
I ordered the TONKOTSU ramen with chyashu pork of course, but they ran out of pork!!! So I supplemented with egg and chicken. 
Soup was thin and flavorless, egg over cooked, chicken bland, the bean sprouts, and spinach was not helpful or wanted!
I make better instant ramen at home! Having had unforgettable ramen from Japan and very good ramen in Hawaii and irresistable ramen in Vegas even.... I'm sad AZ ramen is embarrassing."}
{"text":"I'm not super into ramen, but I've been eyeballing this place for months every time I pass it. Today, it was time to finally give it a try.

I got the republic ramen with pork. The menu says that every ramen dish comes with spinach, sprouts, scallions and carrots. My order came with most of this, except the carrots. Instead, I got carrot. 1 tiny piece of a carrot. Haha.. that's a bit of a shame considering I love carrots. I wasn't expecting  a lot, but it was literally just a tiny nickel-sized piece of carrot. The broth was not terribly flavorful. The portion size was generous enough that I can get two meals out of it, which is nice for the price.

I also got the veggie tempura side, which is usually 3 dollars, but was only 2 because I came during happy hour. It was pretty good- highlight of my lunch/dinner.

The boba I got was definitely the best part. It might not be the greatest boba ever, but I'm not exactly a connoisseur so it seemed pretty damn good to me. I got the Thai milk tea, and it was super delicious with a generous portion of boba. Very refreshing on a hot summer day.

The staff was very friendly.

All in all.. I think I might try some other dishes here, but I probably won't come back for the ramen. Will definitely return for tea."}
{"text":"I came in to Ramen Republic just past 8pm the other day to order a boba drink. I have been there before and find their ramen okaaay, but on Tuesday I only wanted to grab a drink on my way home. I quickly looked up their restaurant hours and when I saw that they closed at 9pm I knew I had more than enough time. After all, it was only 8:10 or so. 

When I walked in and approached the boba menu (which is off to the side a bit), the girl at the counter said nothing to me. Not even a greeting. After making a mental selection on which flavor I wanted to get, I got in line behind a group of four friends, who I assumed were about to order since they were all standing in front of the register. I was standing for quite a few minutes minding my own business before I finally realized they weren't ordering at all! They were all chatting with the cashier who was loudly complaining to them about how customers will often stay in the restaurant past close, and how it drives her crazy because she has much more important things to do and thats she's in medical school and blah blah blah. The girl was literally ranting. At this point there is at least one other costumer who has gotten in line behind me, and two additional girls walk in and approach the boba menu. She calls over to them \"The boba machine is closed.\" and when they asked why she said in a matter-of-fact tone, \"It closes an hour before the kitchen.\" turns her head back to the group of guys talking to her and rolls her eyes. Why couldn't she have mentioned that to me when I walked in?! She HAD to have seen me leaning over to read the boba menu? I left, highly agitated that I wasted so much time waiting in \"line\" to order a drink she would have refused to prepare anyway. When a restaurant posts it's hours, I have to assume all menu items will be available unless otherwise specified, and the rule about the boba machine is not stated anywhere online or in store. In fact, I think the girl working was just lying so she didn't have to stay late to clean the machine. Either way, I was so off-put by the service that I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Like similar reviewers, I'm rating this restaurant semi-highly because of their fun drink selection (including boba and chu-hi's), and not necessarily because of the ramen.

Flat out, ANY Japanese-style restaurant that sells chu-hi gets my nod of approval. I absolutely love that cheap, wine-cooler like liquor and it's so, so difficult to find in the states. The boba here is really nice as well. The guy working the counter the first time I had boba was even considerate enough to ask me how sweet I wanted it!

I had the vegetarian ramen and gyoza when I ate here. I am very particular about ramen, and for me the broth wasn't complex or flavorful enough. I am planning to go back and try the tonkatsu ramen as a final verdict, so we'll see. Plus the gyoza was deep fried, and I was hoping it would have been prepared more authentic-style--steamed on the top and crispy only on the bottom.

Overall, this place is a nice homage to authentic Japanese ramen shops (even in decor), but not quite the real deal."}
{"text":"I found Republic Ramen after a spring training game in Mesa.  I was starving, saw their sign, and decided to pop in.  

I'm not really a ramen connoisseur, have only eaten it a few times.  But I did like this place, enough to come back again on my way back home. Friendly service, tasty food, very generous portions, and bright, clean location.  The server and cook made it a point to verify my order a couple times (they basically wanted to ensure I wasn't expecting a vegan serving), which I thought was good service. I'll drop in again next time I'm in Tempe."}
{"text":"So surprised by this place. I should of known everything would be great by the sheer fact that they have boba. AAhhhh, I looooovveeee boba. Outside of boba, the soup was great! The biggest serving I've ever had in regards to soup. I ordered the miso soup with tofu because I wasn't feeling too adventurous flavor wise. The soup is mostly broth in comparison to veggies, noodles, and protein selection (but keep in mind the size of the bowl). Seaweed salad was put together in a way I've never seen before. It was very artistic. Usually I've only ever seen it just as the seaweed alone. Very cool. I appreciated that they served forks for those of us who are chop stick challenged when it comes to soup and noodles. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Absoluetly love it here! I came by three times this week and the taste was the same. The spicy ramen was not too spicy and had awesome flavor. Some of the workers are really kind and attentive. The chicken curry was really good too! Have yet to try the Boba, but will do the next time i stop in."}
{"text":"It was good. There were a variety of options to choose from. In a great location and easy to find. Wasn't blown away, though."}
{"text":"Only ate here once; got the lightest ramen (chicken base?) with chicken cubes.  So tasty!  OK, so the noodles aren't homemade (hence the lack of 5th star) but was impressed with the takeout packaging.  The broth was kept separate from the noodles/veg/meat so I could combine them at home.  Huge portion, had enough for leftovers the next day.  The Bobo wasn't sweet enough for my liking, but I can ask for sugar next time.  I was also glad to find another Bobo joint.  I'm so going to be back!"}
{"text":"Good, casual Ramen restaurant.  Takes a while for you to get your order.  Inside can feel crowded."}
{"text":"After hearing my friends talk about this place all the time I finally decided to give it a try a couple night ago, bad idea because it was pretty crowded! I checked the menu online and was unsure if I would even like it (Only ever had .10 ramen) I don't ever leave reviews but I was slightly surprised this place didn't have more positive feedback. I ordered the tonkatsu ramen which the cashier recommended it was pretty good  but the noodles were slightly overlooked. Loved the portions size tho! I do think they should put less broth, the noodle to broth ratio is off. Like the other reviewer wrote, I too thought it was weird there was a tip option for the workers BUT while waiting for my food I realized just how much the cashier does! They were all over the place doing so many things it was hard to even get a container for the rest of my ramen. I probably noticed all this since I've mostly worked in restaurants most my life and know how hectic it can be. Anyways, pretty good ramen! Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen, which was quite good.  The noodles were cooked perfectly!  Very tasty food, although a tad overpriced."}
{"text":"Ramen is lacking in the Phoenix area.  However, if you have a craving for ramen, Republic Ramen will satisfy you.  You have the standard tonkotsu (pork marrow), miso, and shoyu (soy sauce) broths with some nice variants of these standards.  They're all tasty and you have a nice variety of traditional and not so traditional add-ins.  I found the restaurant to have a nice, \"good enough\" decor, though they lose a star due to the dirty bathrooms.  The management really needs to implement a more regular bathroom cleaning schedule.

Price is decent, though expect to add on top of the base price."}
{"text":"Quick Note:
If you are looking for a upscale \"instant noodle\", then this is the place. I should add the ramen served is not really instant noodle, but closely resembles one. If you are looking for a true ramen place, this is not it and if you are a purist-who-complains-a-LOT, stay away! I recommend it to most otherwise.

The Food:
Fortunately, the range of additional toppings is pretty good, but every little bit adds up. The total for my order of Spicy Ramen +Egg +Chashu +Vege Paste +Garlic Paste +Chili Paste and a regular drink adds up to $17.27!!!

The soup is what resembles instant noodle the most. It taste like plenty of MSG in it, but is so delicious, I finished it anyways. 

The Place:
The place looks even more spacious due to it's open design. Definitely a hipster vs foodie place. There is a bar/restaurant combo on one side and a regular restaurant on the other side.

Da Service:
This place is pretty much self-service except when they bring the food to you. You order it at the counter. They give you a placard on a holder with a number for delivery to table. Condiments and utensils are near the soda machine.

Ultimately: 
Not too bad. Not excellent. A good place for students, which seems like the bulk of their customers anyways. Unless you are overly critical over ramen, add this place to the list of backup restaurants especially on a cold day (but this is AZland!)."}
{"text":"I live about 20 miles from this place but I would walk there if I had to, that's how much I love their ramen. I usually get the Chili Pepper Ramen with traditional toppings and beef, too good for words!"}
{"text":"So delicious! The service was awesome & super friendly to a couple of 1st timers. The guy who took our order took the time to explain the menu & how to order. Our food came out fast & hot. I ordered the Republic style & only wish that the broth had a little more beef flavor to it. Nonetheless, I was very pleased. We also had the gyoza, which came out crispy & very yummy. They were a pretty good deal-$2 for 3 dumplings. The portions are large-I finished about 75% of my bowl & left full, happy & very satisfied. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Tempe.  I have tried a couple of the ramens, but the Republic and chili pepper are my go-to favorites.  I usually order the ramen with traditional toppings, but both selections of toppings are great.  I also enjoy the good selection of bobas.  The prices are also pretty reasonable and if you are looking for ramen this is the place to try."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! I've been coming here for over 4 years now. The staff is wonderful and helpful and I love seeing them when I come in. They also remember me and my boyfriend which is amazing! The food is also great here, I've had the edamame, multiple ramen bowls, and multiple flavors of their boba teas. 
My all around favorite: pork tankatsu ramen and Thai milk tea boba. 
I probably order this combination the most out of anything else here and I love it!"}
{"text":"The first time I went, they were horribly understaffed. No spoons, dirty tables all over the place, took at least 10+ minutes for the order, the experience was a mess. If I hadn't come back, it'd be a one-star easy.

Gave it another shot as it was the only place open at the time. Tried the miso ramen this time, but if it wasn't for the miso floating in the soup, I'd think it was normal shoyu broth. They did try to be creative with different veggies, but the baby spinach is not a great idea as it broke down quickly in the hot broth, which was still hot after a while, so a plus there. Maybe I've been spoiled by other ramen shops on the west coast, but I find this place forgettable. Well, the only thing I won't forget is not wanting to come back."}
{"text":"After getting a massage (and propositioned by two naked Asian \"massage therapists\")

(Oh no I din't!!!)

~just massage my feet please~

I headed over here to try the veggie Ramen, and I have to say it was very tasty.

Almost as tasty as the intoxicating blonde who took my order.

Too bad she wasn't on the dessert menu.

All in all, a happy ending for sure."}
{"text":"Ramen isn't like that foamy starch they serve in Styrofoam cups you get from the truck stop.  Ramen is a rich, thick broth with hearty noodles, delicious meat (or tofu), and some exotic add-ons to pull the whole experience together.  If you're a ramen fan, or just want to try something new and delicious in Tempe, visit Republic Ramen + Noodles.

This place serves dome fabulous ramen.  They also have a cafe that serves delicious milk tea."}
{"text":"I get the rice noodles in my ramen so I don't have to worry about glutein. I love the food. I have been here by myself to just sit down and eat and it doesn't feel weird  at all. I like to just pick up some yummies and go. There is enough in one ramen bowl for 2 or 3 meals. They also have beer and saki and edmame and my personal favorite gyoza. This is a great place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I'd been eating here for over a year, but recently something has changed.  I still like it, but it isn't the meal that has drawn me to eat there as often as I had been before."}
{"text":"An alright little place. Lots of college students and university staff can be found here (ASU). The staff are above average and have never been an issue seeing as they really just take your order at the register and then bring your food out, so there isnt really much to mess up. Its the food. If you cant eat pork, prepare to be disappointed, they have 1 dish, literally 1 dish that ISNT made with pork broth. Its really disheartening, but I didnt dock points for that because whatever im just one person and thats my specific need. I did however dock points because even with the 1 dish that I had, it was extremely...bland. Now the only things with flavor were the added ingredients, but even then I felt like the egg had just the flavor beat out of it along with anything else in the bowl. Its not horrible exactly but it definitely leaves something to be desired. I constantly order the 2/4 piece shrimp tempura and the edamame sides and BOTH of them TASTE LIKE THE RAMEN, in that they dont really taste like much at all! 

I mean fuckin' hell how do you remove flavor from shrimp? Why does edamame taste like literally nothing? This place is really a mystery to me. I go there sometimes when I happen to be driving by, but lets just say that I never leave my house with the intent of going to Republic Ramen."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like ramen? Their menu is build-your-own style and every choice is delicious."}
{"text":"I'm happy to see that something worthwhile has replaced the dismal hole that was Sparky's.  The atmosphere is light and calm, the service is friendly, and the staff seems to enjoy what they do.  When I went, they said they were still perfecting their recipes, which means it should only get even better.

You order at the counter, grab a table, and they bring your food when it's ready.  Soda is self-serve.  I had ramen and spam, and it was my first time with spam.  It was good for what it was, but just not to my taste.  The rest of the soup was pretty good though.  The squid salad ($6 for a decent amount of it) was very good and the squid didn't have that weird rubbery texture it gets when it isn't quite fresh.  I got a mango-almond snow boba and it was amaaziing.  Seriously, try this.  The guy who made it even tried some and was impressed.

Definitely will go back here.  Maybe even later today because it's sounding pretty good right now."}
{"text":"Udon noodle itself is good but the soup is like way too salty!  Salty and terrible salty!"}
{"text":"My stop here was at the request of my Son. Geeze the bowl I had was very bland and warm at best. The chicken was very tough and it tasted like they just threw it all together with tap water. I see why it might be popular for the students...inexpensive for the amount of food. But guys, there was no taste to it. My Sons also was bland. Now wonder there is so much Sriracha & dry spices around. But, it all needs to be cooked together in my opinion for flavor."}
{"text":"I stop by and finaly  try this ramen soup, is amazing :) my friend tell me about but never had time to come here and have this soup. I will come back for sure :)"}
{"text":"I needed to write my first review because this place had a 3.5 star rating and I think it's unfair. This is only after my first visit here and it was by chance because Unami was closed.

My first encounter with ramen outside of a cup of noodles was in san francisco at Ajisen Ramen, that place spoiled me and helped me set a standard. Ever since then Ive had ramen regularly in san diego and las vegas and once in New York, all good, however only two are worthy #2s after Ajisen's Tonkotsu ramen and they are Tajima in San Diego and Republic Ramen in Tempe.

I ordered a Tonkotsu broth with pork and traditional topings, although they got my toppings wrong and gave me original Republic Ramen toppings which were scallions, spinach and carrots, but you know what? It was still reaaaally good. I asked for a medium spice to the broth and it made my nose a lil' runny, which I love ... perfect spice, and also a soy sauce cured egg, which I was hoping was soft boiled but was hard boiled, again, it didnt detract from the experience.

In conclusion this place is legit and has above standard ramen, unlike Cherry Blossom Cafe or Culinary Drop Out and Clever Koi which are all wanna bes compared to Republic Ramen. This place is Legit! I will be driving from Metro PHX to Tempe at least twice a month to this place."}
{"text":"Excellent food and serving sizes

Always hot and fresh

Never had a bad experience to date.

Love adding corn and egg to my bowl along with a pina colada boba slush!"}
{"text":"This 5 star rating is mostly for their boba! They are cool about how many flavors I put into my boba (usually about 4!) unlike other boba shops that only allow like 2

Their ramen is pretty good and decently priced. However, I don't like coming to this place much ONLY because I don't like coming out smelling like an Asian restaurant."}
{"text":"Place was clean and had a modern look. Ordered the tonkatsu ramen with pork.  The ramen came in a large bowl with all the fixins (bean sprouts, green onions, carrots, and spinach) which I really did not care for. The broth was flavorful, the pork was tasty and plentiful, and the noodles were very good. Overall, very satisfied as I was craving ramen.  I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I give it four stars just cause I can't find any other place in the valley that specializes in ramen. I think it's worth the money, I'm usually filled to the brim by the time I'm done eating. Most ramen can be customized, you can choose what meat to add, you can also add fishcake, eggs, and extra vegetables. The basic ramen is loaded with vegetables anyway, so you don't have to drink a V8 later. 

The atmosphere is a little awkward though, the usual music being played is pretty obnoxious. Otherwise a fine establishment, nice staff, clean floors, tables, utensils, etc."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place as my first ramen experience. Super good ramen and good prices. Large amounts, the kimchi is only $1 and you get a huge portion. Been back four times in one month."}
{"text":"Well, it was a nice experience, the server was nice, and it was pricy, but considering its the only ramen place around i can deal with it. I doubt its anything like ramen in japan, but again, it's the only choice. I'll be going back. If anything just for the boba, which was refreshing and tasty. :)"}
{"text":"Their boba with coffee is great... we had the tonkotsu ramen and the republic ramen... the actual ramen noodles were pretty good and the broth was tasty. I can't say is the best I've had... but not bad...the pork and the beef not very good with an old taste..  size was good and the place nice and clean as well. Cashier was a little clumsy  when food was delivered to the table... spilling broth on the tray and table... overall an ok experience..."}
{"text":"I'm from Los Angeles, and I've had some incredible ramen in that area, and was really sad that there aren't really any ramen places around the Phoenix area.  When I first learned that there was a ramen place opening up, I thought to myself that there was the potential for a great experience.

The idea of this place is nice, but the execution is lacking.  I ordered the Republic Ramen + Gyoza combo, with the extremely spicy option, no additions, I wanted to try their base specialty.

The gyoza was alright, it was a little too greasy when I got it, but I much prefer fried gyoza to steamed, so that was a plus.  Unfortunately, this gyoza was mixed, meat and veggies, and I wasn't prepared for that.  Generally, I prefer pork gyoza, although I know some people who prefer veggie gyoza.  The combination didn't work too well because there wasn't quite enough meat, and the veggies were a little too rubbery for my taste.

Individually, components were good, I could tell the vegetables were fresh; the green onion had the taste of raw green onion, the bean sprouts were crisp, the spinach hadn't the time to wilt. and the naruto slice tasted of fish, and not of bland texture.

What I found lacking, however, was that the broth was overly salty and lacking it's own depth of flavor, it was also not hot enough, and the pork was very overcooked - I'm not just saying that, either, the pork was brown.  As a matter of taste, I would have preferred they use japanese spinach or nori in the ramen, and for the broth to have been piping hot, still bubbling even.

All in all, it was nothing spectacular, with lots of room to improve.  For the price, though, it was a decent meal."}
{"text":"Went in on a Monday night and waited in a 15 minute line. Sat down and got our food at separate times and after we finished our meals, had to wait at the front for my boba tea I ordered for 15 more minutes. Umami down the road is better."}
{"text":"This is our favorite ramen restaurant and for good reason. The food is great and the staff is fantastic!"}
{"text":"HEY YALL....boy oh boy am I glad against my best judgement of not feeling well am i glad that I left this hotel to come to this place Republic Ramen Noodles SWEET BABY JESUS...I ordered Tonkotsu Ramen added sweet corn and an order of tempura shrimp. I was very very tastee...The pork I added was not memorable,  but that was my focus either my main concern was the noodles( plentiful) and broth( hot & yummy )....When I go back later this week I will be ordering this again, but without meat nothing personal but when are we going up we ate Ramen all the time without meat it was just a bonus. Oh yea I had them to removed the bean sprouts and next time NO SPINACH. This is a must try anytime you come to Tempe, Arizona."}
{"text":"Great ramen. Spent a year in Japan and this reminded me of being there. Will be going back."}
{"text":"I found a good Raman place here in the Phoenix area. I'm from LA so Republic Ramen doesn't compare but hey it's great to  find a location in Phoenix. 

I ordered a Tonkotsu Ramen, traditional toppings with the addition of egg & zucchini. It was very yummy. Noodles were perfectly cooked and the broth & vegetables all work together.

For those looking for good Ramen this place hits the mark. I recommend Republic Ramen!"}
{"text":"First time here when in with big expectations was greatly disappointed. The service was bad had to wait more than 30 minutes for my food for takeout. They gave me a lame excuse something about a printer. You would think that the front cashiers would see no food going out and would of caught the problem right away instead of waiting around for 20 or 30 minutes. Finally got back to my room with my ordered (Tokyo ramen noodles and the shrimp tempura) It was only a two minute walk and the shrimp tempura was cold and Soggy and the soup was not what I expected. I've had better ramen noodles from a grocery store do-it-yourself pack. Maybe the only good thing was the fresh veggies that came with it"}
{"text":"The ramen noodles here are filling and tasty. I got a to go order and was happy with the packaging of the soup. They put the broth separate from the noodles and toppings that way it doesn't get soggy and you still get the same amount as you would eating in the restaurant. There's also a cool bobba tea spot connected to the building that I'm excited to try.

The service was good as the staff was friendly and accommodating and the wait for the food wasn't bad.

The price was decent as well. You get a lot of food for about $10. Overall, good noodles for a good price."}
{"text":"This place is yummy! The udon broth is tasty and the prices are very reasonable. It's also close to campus, which is a huge plus for me because it's convenient to stop by for a meal anytime. The only downside is the horribly long lines during peak hours, when the queue goes out the door. The boba is decent, they didn't put very much boba into the cup, but it was delicious nonetheless. Highly recommend if you're craving good ramen or udon!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best ramen place I have ever been too.. I always get the republic ramen with tofu and chicken it's so amazing! The only place I eat ramen at."}
{"text":"Great food for the value.  Prices are excellent and a solid choice of Vegetarian dishes.   Hot and iced tea choices pushed this from 4 to 5 stars"}
{"text":"I would take Republic Ramen for what it is- fast food ramen priced inexpensively, located in the heart of a college town. 

There is, unfortunately, a huge dearth of good ramen places here in Phoenix. When my girlfriend told me about this, I was keen on checking it out. I love Cherry Blossom, but it gets a bit boring to have that be the only joint in town I enjoy ramen at! Also, nothing helps clear blocked allergies like hot ramen and a steaming cup of green tea! 

I got the tonkatsu ramen, whilst the boyfriend got the miso ramen. I had no complaints about mine. It wasn't rocking my proverbial world, but it was good decent food. It tasted like tonkatsu broth, and I liked the fresh spinach, bean sprouts and the egg I paid extra for. 

His miso ramen, however, was very disappointing. A friend had warned me that this was 'white people ramen', and his ramen lived up to that warning. It tasted like bland, straight up soy sauce broth. No trace of miso at all. I actually forgot he had miso stock and not the soy sauce before he reminded me about it. 

The gyoza were also nicely edible, but nothing to go home talking about. 

As I said, take it for what it is. Fast food ramen in a college town. It's good to satisfy your cravings, but not something that will rock your world. Not everything can be 5 stars. My suspicion is that you'll find just such mediocre ramen places even in Japan."}
{"text":"Dear Republic Ramen, I wanted to like you so much.

Your decent prices and over-the-counter breezy service were the reason why I walked in today. But there's one thing that's made me feel compelled to write this review. Here it goes. 

I simply cannot tolerate the blatant cheating using MSG to create your broth. That Ichiban Instant Ramen flavor was instantly recognizable the second I tasted your \"Tonkotsu\" broth. Where's the thickness, richness, the layers of flavor, the fat floating on top? Not to mention 3 hours later, that MSG extreme thirsty feeling hits me and I know clearly who's the culprit. 

Republic Ramen, it's been good knowing you but I'm afraid we won't see each other again. Sayonara."}
{"text":"Only true ramen joint in this cultureless barren wasteland known as Phoenix metropolitan area.  Enjoy it while you can, places like this doesn't have long life expectancy."}
{"text":"You cant go wrong with the Ramen... It's as good as any I've had in Tokyo, NY or SF...  The Miso is great and all the fresh ingredients blend deliciously. I also like the gyoza and shrimp tempura as well. It adds up quick, but if you go there hungry you wont be disappointed..."}
{"text":"Republic Ramen is amazing! I love all the broth flavors, and the variety of add-ins. And their cafe is great too! Excellent boba, and coffee as well"}
{"text":"The broth is bland, and the noodles were too soggy--worse than the ones in Top Ramen. Step up your game!"}
{"text":"I am not going to share my giant noodle soup bowl with anyone.
Nor am I going to share my Boba with anyone.  
 
Soup:  nice presentation, not too salty.  Not too hot, nor cold;  just right to dig in right away.  Pick your broth;  I'm a salt o holic, and even then, I added more salt and spice to my broth, so sue me and pass me the hypertensive pill.
 
Gyoza:  could eat more;  please give more.  
 
Boba pearls:  nice chewy consistency;  not overdone or underdone.  No aspiration pnemonia here;  could be a bit colder in temp, but that's probably because I waited to drink it after I ate the bowl of ramen.  
 
Beggars can't be choosers;  the Ramen here is decent.  It's better than the 49 cent kind (inflation you know) and far worse than the noodle houses in Japan--what do you expect, it's the DESERT for heaven's sake.  
 
For college kids:  what a great intro to far east staple food."}
{"text":"Delicious ramen with a nice variety of options. Great option for eating there or taking it to go."}
{"text":"This place has great food, no doubting that. The service, though, is just atrociou. The proportions were really unevenly distributed. My date and I ordered the same exact meal and mine had at least 3x the amount of noodles she had. Also I ordered a snow tarot boba when I first came in, they delivered it half way through the meal. It ended up being the wrong type of boba, so I told them , and it wasn't delivered for 30 more minutes. my date even overheard the workers talking badly about me for asking about my rightful order. This place could be so great if it weren't this horrendous service."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but this place is by far the worse place I ever dined. Watching  the cooks playing with there coffee drink while I ordered makes me uncomfortable also watching them slap the the waitress on the ass while I was trying to order was unacceptable and the taste of the food proved to horrible!"}
{"text":"First and formost I will have you know I am an avid pho eater and Boba drinker. Coming from the Los Angeles area, I know what is good and what is not. This place is AWESOME! Service is fantastic. There is a server there named Tony who is extremely personable and makes delicious drinks-ask for him. The music is good and there is a nice vibe. The Shoyu is definitely my favorite bowl as well as the Thai Milk Tea! The boba is always soft. The restaurant is extremely clean and the workers take pride in their services there. They also have a wide variety of alcoholic beverages. This place is GREAT, I recommend it to all of my close friends. Also very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Today is cool and rainy.  Perfect day for Ramen & noodles.  Wife ordered Tonkotsu and I had Republic ramen. We both had pork for the meat extra corn and an egg. The Tonkotsu clean mild promontory. The Republic had complex flavor mild spicy I added Saatchi . Both the noodles were good.  We both really enjoyed the food.  Really hit the spot on a day like today.  We will return.  Food taste great,  price reasonable and food is plentiful."}
{"text":"My girl and I popped in after our Friday movie at 8:30. We wait at the front counter for 5 minutes waiting to place our order but nobody came but not for lack of people. There was a girl mopping a spilled drink right by the counter and she never acknowledged us. There was a guy with a mustache that came out from the back and walked the length of counter twice he looked at us but just put his head like we weren't there. Needless to say we're eating Thai food now. Would've loved to try this place but apparently they didn't want our business. Good luck with that business model."}
{"text":"Pretty delicious ramen in Tempe. I had the pork ramen with extra noodles and an egg. The broth was tasty and I added a little sriracha and soy sauce to kick it up a notch. The serving was gigantic and hot (with enough to bring home), I just wish the pork was a little different. It was pretty fatty and the big slices were hard to consume with chopsticks and a spoon."}
{"text":"I desperate search of pho after a cold rainy night led us here as it was the only place open late! We had to wait a while for a someone to free up and grab our order because it was still busy right before closing time. It wasn't pho, but it was good enough to warm my soul with spice and noodles. I've had miso ramen at Kabuki, but this place puts spinach and other veggies in the ramen. I missed the herbs that usually accompany pho to give it a fresh zing, but I can understand as ramen is a totally different cuisine and dish. The ambience was modern Asian with a mysterious, cool vibe. I want to go back to get some snow for dessert because I've heard it is like tasting a sweet/tangy cumulus cloud!"}
{"text":"We should have known to turn around when we walked in... It doesn't smell very good and the atmosphere is nothing remarkable. But we were starving, craving ramen, and had ridden our bikes. I had the veggie ramen with tofu and an egg. My girlfriend had the Sapporo ramen with tofu and an egg. Oh, it was just not good. Super bland. Nothing interesting about it. Kind of gross actually. I don't know what else to say. Don't eat here."}
{"text":"My meal here was just OK.  There were a few people in line in front of us, but we waited almost 15 minutes to place our order.  Not sure why it took so long.  At least our food was quickly brought to our table.

There's only one vegetarian option on the menu, which is not ideal.  It was OK, but it seemed like there were an awful lot of bean sprouts in it and not as many noodles as I would have liked.  I quickly finished the noodles and was left with a bowl full of broth and sprouts.  There were just a few small slices of tofu...disappointing for sure.

We also ordered a smoothie, and we waited about 25 minutes for it, longer than it took us to finish our meal.  We ended up taking it with us.  They said it took so long because it took a long time to make the boba, but we ordered ours without boba, and I guess it didn't occur to them to make ours first since they could do it right away.

The restaurant was clean and the food was pretty good, but overall not a satisfying experience.  I'll probably try it again when they've had longer to get their act together."}
{"text":"Excellent and unique food, helpful and friendly employees and very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I got the vegetarian ramen. The broth was amazing. Very good flavor. However, it took so long for the ramen to come out. Luckily I didn't have a crazy time crunch. Not sure if it was worth the wait or not."}
{"text":"Having grown up experiencing some of the best that San Francisco has to offer in terms of food, I am definitely picky about where I will go to pay for a meal. Thankfully my high expectations were not only met but exceeded when I stumbled upon Republic Ramen. After much though, I decided to order the Shrimp Tempura Udon noodles. After a short wait time, the udon was brought out to me along with the noodles, Naruto, and tempura all packaged in separate containers. I absolutely love it when restaurants take the extra effort to package the foods separately as not to let the food get too soggy too quickly. Albeit there is an environmental concern with all the extra plastic. However, I am here to judge the food, not the restaurant's impact on the world. The broth was full of flavor and warming, exactly what I look for when ordering Udon. The saltiness was perfectly balanced and not overbearing. Onions, scallions, spinach, and seaweed were all fresh and delicious. My only small disappointment was the crunchiness of the tempura, as it was a little soft. This was made up for with the vast tea selection they had available for purchase.

For such great food, the pricing was incredibly reasonable. I ended up paying no more than $11 for a filling, healthy, and extremely flavorful meal. While I have definitely been to cheaper Ramen houses, I could understand the pricing due to Arizona's land locked status. Obviously the shipping cost becomes a factor for any restaurant that wants to serve quality sea food to desert dwellers.

The ambience of the establishment was also very relaxing and welcoming. The rooms are all lit with a soft and dim lighting. Decorations you would expect to find in ramen houses adorn the walls and ceilings. The tables and chairs were all quality made and comfortable to sit on. In addition, there was a seating area for when one was waiting for their food to be cooked (if one was doing take-out instead of dining in).

The atmosphere was inviting. The light smell of ramen and udon broth filled the room, strong enough to make entice one's appetite yet subtle enough to be pleasant. Music also played in the background of the normal restaurant noise. I came at a relatively busy time (in the later afternoon) so I was greeted with a the warm noise of restaurant chatter and conversation. Overall it was a enjoyable area to dine. 
Last but certainly not least was the service. I was greeting by a smiling cashier. Since it was my first time at Republic Ramen I asked for the cashier's recommendations. She went above and beyond by explaining her favorite different types of Udon and Ramen. Once I had ordered my food I took a number and then sat down at one of the tables. My food was promptly brought out to me and the runner thanked me for coming and let me know he hoped I enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"This place is truly superb in all ways! Service was excellent!! First time visiting here the help was very patient in explaining the options and offered several drink options to compliment my dinner. Afterwards I enjoyed a boba slushie that was through the roof! It was somewhat of a slow time and so the waitress was free a lot of the time and had a wonderful time chatting the evening away, though she had no trouble offering the same attention to the other guests!"}
{"text":"Noodles were good, but the restaurant is filthy.  Everything I touched had a greasy coating, smell of burnt grease in the air, and the bathrooms...oy, the bathrooms were disgusting.  Plenty of other places that are actually clean, and good."}
{"text":"This place is always super good. Their noodle bowls are HUGE!! And I eat a lot. One bowl will last me two meals. Always a plus."}
{"text":"Coming here with a friend, I hoped for an authenticish Asian food meal. I ordered the shrimp tempura udon. While the shrimp itself was great, the soup was nothing special.  The broth was not flavored or offered any type of spicy zest. The meal was unfortunately bland and a bit too salty for my taste. Additionally, the vegetables were overwhelming within the soup at the lack of meat. For a ramen spot, I have had better for the price of $8. The quantity of food was great but the quality did not follow at this level."}
{"text":"Have to say I will most likely never return to here.

Reason being is that the \"service\" is horrendous. Walked into the \"restaurant,\" and didn't even get a greeting. Staff was more focused on sweeping/mopping the kitchen/floors behind the counter than to greet my group and direct us how the restaurant works and where we go. (You order and pay first and seat yourselves.)

When odrdering, the girl in a chefs jacket wasn't very knowledgeable about the specifics of each Ramen dish. 

I say this mainly because I had ordered extra pork and charsiu (Chinese BBQ pork) and when my bowl came out there wasn't any hint of it and I was told again, that it's in there, just a different cut of meat. 

In my bowl there was just gray pieces of pork. No telltale red of the charsiu.

The place was also extremely dirty. Trash all over the floors, unbussed tables, tables that had been cleared had food debris/broth in the surfaces."}
{"text":"Dear reviewers reading,
This place is too cute. Very trendy and laid back like as if you stepped into Scott Pilgrim movie very hipster. Sells a limit number of ramen noodles and soups, along with boba teas. With the price they charge you get a ton of anything, never a small portion, I was worried that I was going to get something little or not worth it but was I wrong. The bowls are HUGE HUGE HUGE and comes with a lot. Very delicious and fills one up easy. Really good service they always check on the people to make sure everything is going good in fact my friend accidentally raised her hand barely up and someone came running over to see if she needed anything. 

Down sides would be a tad bit pricey but you get a ton, limited seating if it's a full house it might go bad, little selection of boba teas."}
{"text":"I'm still a little bit hopeful about this place, but I will need to give it another try. Overall, I found my tonkotsu ramen bland and the beef painfully dry. I was very disappointed the toppings were pricey but at least you get a big portion. (Is it just me or isn't egg something mandatory in all ramen bowls?) I wish they had soft boiled eggs but greatful it was soaked in soy sauce and wasn't scambled (like another place that shall remain nameless). The chili pepper ramen was a different story. It packed some heat that gradually intensified as the hot broth warmed the thai chili peppers. I can't say much about the pork my boyfriend ordered with it because he ate it all..."}
{"text":"I'm not being harsh but this is not real ramen. The soup looks boring. Ajisen Ramen is average in California but if compares to this place, it would become gourmet ramen. ASU students could use this place for late night dinner instead of fast food or instant noodles though."}
{"text":"New favorite lunch spot. An unbelievable amount of food at a reasonable price. I have lived in Japan and I can honestly say this is the real deal. It is delicious and authentic. You don't really need to know any more. Just go."}
{"text":"The ramaen was ok, The Tonkatsu lacked depth, but it is the only place I know in Arizona that I can get Tonkatsu any day, for that alone it earned 4 stars."}
{"text":"Nice big bowl of Ramen. Beef and Spam sliced thin with tonkotsu and traditional toppings, hit the spot! Great for fast-food ramen!"}
{"text":"It is sooo yummy!!! Fresh, warm broth!!! The noodles were nice and soft but not too soft and were just done to break apart in your mouth!! The veggies are perfect and I added an egg and more noodles...how can you have enough, really? Good selection of different kinds of bowls, rice, teas, some beer...not a lot, but some. And all w/in a reasonable price. It's all a nestled in a open seating, for family dining, or couples, or if you just wanna come in and just have a bowl by yourself....I hope you do, IT WORTH IT MY FRIEND???"}
{"text":"Ramen here is substandard.  It is by far the worst of 3 Ramen houses in the southeast side of the valley.

This is more of a hangout spot with subpar food.  

The egg was a normal hard boiled egg with gray edges on the yolk, the beef was chewy and lacking of flavor.

It has really gone down hill over the past couple of years."}
{"text":"I came here once before to grab a bowl of warm ramen for a sick friend, and only had their thai milk tea boba (which is really great). I came back last night with a group of friends and had their vegetarian broth ramen with zucchini and a boiled egg. For a (HUGE) bowl of ramen and a boba tea, the total was only $12. I had plenty of leftovers for today. Their broth selection is expansive (even if they only have one vegetarian option) and their add-on's aren't pricey. I'm no ramen expert, and just recently was introduced to it. I've tried ramen at one other local restaurant and I have to say that Republic Ramen is pretty great for the price."}
{"text":"Awesome place for noodles! Been here 3xs and the udon noodles are sooo good! The republic ramen and Tokyo ramen are both delicious! Price is great too!"}
{"text":"I walked in and felt like I was in the bar scene of The Gremlins. Chaos.

Started my order. First, out of boba. Ok, fine. I'll have a Thai tea. Nope, the whole tea bar is closed. Why? She didn't tell me that to start. That would've been a little more ok.

Ramen order. Out of egg. Why? That's ridiculous. Who is managing this place? There was a written list of items that were not available taped to the register. Weird.

Counter help walked away to do something else while I was in the middle of my order and with a line of people behind me.

Saw the kitchen from the counter. Looked like a disaster with a couple of guys working that looked like they had not a clue what they were doing.

Ended up walking out. Will not go back."}
{"text":"I've come here many times, but every time the experience has not improved much.

Though flavorful, the broth is always too salty for my taste. The noodles are mediocre; a lot of times they over cook the noodles, resulting in a very mushy noodles in salty broth.

With good pho places nearby, I prefer to get pho most of the time."}
{"text":"Place is just ok when it comes to ramen. It's decently clean and fairly big. Good prices and options. I actually liked the option of spam for the ramen. But, it's definitely not the best ramen place in the area. Biggest disappointment was the egg in the ramen was precooked, hard boiled, and sliced."}
{"text":"I will commend the portions they give you.  They give you A LOT. 
Only if there was flavor. 

Albeit, I came here a week and a half after getting back from a trip to Japan.  I did temper my expectations a lot, but even with those expectations lowered, this was underwhelming. The tables were pretty dirty too.  The service was great.  There is a lot of room for improvement.  

4 Stars for portions, 1 star for flavor."}
{"text":"Maybe I've been spoiled by good ramen joints in Little Tokyo. I got shoyu ramen with extra bamboo shoots. My ramen came out and I finished it before they gave me my almond milk tea. Whoa. 

Chashu is not good. It's super chewy and cardboardy and doesn't melt in your mouth bursting with flavor like it's supposed to. Pork isn't my favorite meat and this place reminds me of why."}
{"text":"I was unsure to expect when i arrived here since it was my first time. The guy at the front was very helpful because i told him it was my first time and had no clue how to order.  I chose my broth which was the spicy one and added beef, corn etc.  It was huge and more than i was expecting.  It was really good.  We ordered Gyoza for our little one and edemame which was a great choice.  It is very nice and clutter free inside.  I ate everything in sight because it was so good. I will definitely be back before i move out of town. I hope to find a place like this in CA."}
{"text":"I really struggle on how many stars to give this place.

On the one hand, there's very, VERY few places to get ramen, saimin, udon, and the like in the Phoenix metro area.  I really appreciate this place as an option!

On the other hand, Republic's ramen is merely fine.  Not amazing, but fine.  It wouldn't pass in Hawaii, but lack of competition here means they'll by default get the business of ramen-cravers like me.  Their broth cannot come close to the savory, complex, authentic ramen I've tried though.  Maybe they're stretching themselves too thin with the bar and dessert/boba options (which I still have no idea how to order).  I'd rather they offer a really solid ramen noodle with either a shio/salt and shoyu/soy broth choice, or even just one absolutely amazing broth.

The \"shrimp purse\" happy hour appetizer was also simply \"fine\" and I wouldn't pay the normal price for it.

It would've been four stars but I am taking one off for their inability to cook an egg properly.  Everyone knows the egg should be either soft and runny to ooze it's rich golden yolk over the noodles, OR be made into a seasoned, rolled japanese omelette (tamagoyaki) and sliced super thin.  NOT hard boiled!

Don't expect a lot of customer service, as they're basically operating as a \"fast casual\" Chipotle-type restaurant.  Some of the tables were not cleared and wiped promptly, despite employees not helping customers.  Count me in as another person who is not a huge fan of the uncomfortable seating

Overall, if I'm in the area and hungry I'll drop by again, but I really don't see myself making a special trip to this side of the valley just to eat here."}
{"text":"The food is decent. The broth is great. The service is meh. The wait time to get your food is ridic."}
{"text":"Food is on point here! Service was good as well. Hubs had the shoyou with spam, a little salty but he loved it. Daughter had the tokoyo with beef which is her regular and she loved it. I had the republic and it was great! The republic was spicy enough to make the nose run but not too hot so you feel like your on fire, perfect balance. We also had the edamame and veggie tempura were aso good. Only drawback for me was that the bathroom was DISGUSTING! Effing disgusting. Seriously have the toilets ever been cleaned? The walls and doors of the stalls were black from the grime. This freaks me out because this has to be the same place your staff washes their hands! Uggh clean your freaking bathroom already!"}
{"text":"Great noodles ,nice location, fair prices ,large servings. Chili ramen with traditional topping, very good."}
{"text":"Stopped here before a football game.  Great food, fast service and we were able to get in and out without any problems! The noodles had great flavor and were filling."}
{"text":"First time here. I decided to get the republic ramen traditional with chicken. This place satisfied my ramen craving but the broth was to salty in my opinion. The egg was cold and hard boiled. This place is okay if your just need a quick ramen fix."}
{"text":"I lived in Japan for a few years and a good bowl of ramen was my idea of a perfect meal. It's simple, so everything has to be just right, otherwise it goes into the mediocre category real quick.

This place is ok. There's really nowhere else nearby for ramen, so I guess it's your only choice. The owners are korean and the flavors do seem more korean than japanese."}
{"text":"Love to order any of the soups with udon noodles. Whether it's 115 degrees or 55 degrees, ramen always hits the spot and satisfies the big 'ol soup with noodles craving! Their honey milk tea with boba is purty gewd too!"}
{"text":"Good-sized bowl that's decently priced in a build-you-own bowl fashion. You'll get five stars when you have  dedicated seafood ramen on the menu; why in God's green Earth does NOWHERE in Arizona with ramen have this? The mind boggles!"}
{"text":"Decent ramen place that's within immediate vicinity of the campus. It's around $8 for a bowl and boba drinks range between $3-5. My favorites are the Tonkotsu Ramen and Chili Pepper Ramen. They are very generous with portions and there's always plenty of meat with my noodles. It's an additional to add extra meat or toppings.They do have other options such as udon and rice. Staff are wonderful and helpful if you need to know something or need them to recommend something delicious. It can be a little dim at night because of the red lights, but I personally love the ambiance."}
{"text":"I love having Republic in the neighborhood. When I'm not feeling well or just want more of a comfort food their tonkotsu ramen is my go to."}
{"text":"Everytime I come to the Phoenix area I make a stop in here for a bowl of tonkotsu ramen with traditional toppings and some gyoza. Some of the better ramen I've had since leaving Las Vegas. If you see the sign and think cup ramen you are dead wrong. After this you will never go back to instant."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in about a year. Was really disappointed since I drove here from chandler. Used to be good. This time it was not even close to being good. 

Got the tonkatsu ramen. The noodles were super soggy and falling apart as I grabbed them with the chopsticks, the broth was extremely salty, and the pork was old. It had a funky taste to it. The only edible part was the extra tofu that I added."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, I should have known better than to expect good ramen but I was still hopeful.  Sadly, I was disappointed.

I ordered the tonkotsu pork belly with an egg traditional style, as well as edamame and gyozas to share.  The appetizers were cooked well and the best part of the meal.  When the huge bowls were ready, I realized that they gave me the modern version of ramen instead of what I ordered.  The sulky girl behind the counter who took my order originally was not what I wanted to deal with again so I went with it.  There was no depth to the broth and the noodles were not ramen noodles as they were soft and kind of slimy.  The store bought packaged kind is better.  Where was the milky broth made rich and unctuous by hours upon hours of slowly simmered pork bones?  This was a poor introduction to ramen for my friend who never had it before.

I couldn't even eat half of it because it was not good and bland.  When we went to get to go containers since I hate to waste food, the same unhelpful girl asked why we needed two...really?"}
{"text":"This was my first time, so I didn't understand how exactly to place my 2 take out orders. The cashier was not helpful at all to explain a rather simple method, these orders then took 30(not even exaggerating) minutes after which I asked to cashier if it Normally took 30 min to which he replied that there were too many orders..let's just say that this was possibly one of the worse customer service experiences I've had."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and all I can say is that it's just OK.  I think it has a lot of potential but it just lacks... lacks decor, ambiance, flavor, etc.  Both times I've been here, the food tasted OK but I feel like it could be so much better.  I only saw 1 TV which was in an awkward position hung near where the drink station is.  The furniture/decor is blah.  With all the little hip places around here, you'd think they'd put a little more into how the restaurant looks.  Anyway, since I'm a mama, maybe I was the only one who noticed that they have fancy Boon High Chairs for the little ones - which made me give them 3-stars and not 2!"}
{"text":"This place should be called Rockn Ramen because the music is straight up green day & the ramen is Rockn. It is near the university so I shoulda known it was going to be collagy. But you shouldn't really listen to me about ramen bcus I've had it like twice in my life & the first time the food was scary so I didn't eat it. But I love me some soup and this ramen was SUPER. Even in this 106 heat it still was tasty. 

We came during happy hour & got gyoza & these shrimp purses for a $1 off, I ate like a million of these things. They were perfectly cooked on the crispier side vs dumpling or dim sum way. I got the Tokyo ramen which is a lil bitty hot, not what you think it is and I shared it w/my Tia cuz it was huge. You also get a choice of original or traditional toppings. Not sure what's the difference but I added egg, garlic, corn per suggestion by my sister & that was the way to do it.  Also add some siracha & sesame oil and bam you good!  We also shared the curry rice as a family & ummm not so much. It was a bit thick & no flavor, very floury...yuck! But who goes to ramen & gets curry, no go. We got boba, of course, which I'm not a fan of cuz I can't drink milk & I also feel those Tapioca balls are going to get lodged in my throat accidentally. Everybody else loves it so I support them plus these are my favorite straws so I get sad when I can't have one. 

It was a good family time, enjoyed my first good ramen....happy! The one thing I did find telling was there were no Asians of any kind there, except the ones we brought so hhhhmmmmmm!"}
{"text":"Even though I do not eat Asian foods often this authentic bowl was easy to judge. I loved every aspect of the Tokyo beef traditional bowl. The portion was huge and the taste was excellent. I will come back again if I get a chance."}
{"text":"Ramen was tasty and the sake flight (4 sake) was inexpensive. However, theAlmond Milk Tea with boba was horrid."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place - I had the pork broth & my wife had the miso broth... you could barely tell them apart.  Both were totally bland, the pork was tasteless, the egg way overcooked, even the gyoza was overdone and plain.  Plus the place was dirty.. at least the beer was cold."}
{"text":"My son was dying to try a ramen noodle soup from this place.  He opted for Republic Ramen with pork--it is one of the spicy ones.  It comes with spinach and a bunch of other veggies.  I opted for an order of pork gyoza.  
The bowl was large containing a large amount of a soy sauce based broth.  It had one slice of pork.  He seemed to enjoy the ramen but left most of the broth.  I had an opportunity to taste the broth and it was just ok.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  The gyoza, on the other hand, were super delicious--gingery, garlicky and porky. The dipping sauce was super salty. 
The place was dimly lit with a reddish lighting that gave a calmness to the place.  I saw lots of students eating their bowls of soups so I take it that this is an ASU hangout.  
I personally would not make a special trip to eat here again although the soup was not terrible.  It's just that there are other places that probably will offer a better soup for a better value."}
{"text":"I choose this location for date night. I was very excited, the place has a nice vibe, but the food wasn't the best. My spicy Ramen was just blah. Might give them another chance and just try something different."}
{"text":"I give this place a four star, just because it give pretty ok ramen, at the location, Tempe. You can't really find real Japanese food around Tempe,  It was interesting how we can chose our meat from, pork,beef, tofu, spam, and chicken. normally pork would be the best choice (chashu) but it's an idea to have little different taste for ramen. Definitely coming back, when I visit Tempe"}
{"text":"Found my BOBA spot!

They have Snow, Slush & Tea options. The are generous with the tapioca balls inside.

The staff is very knowledgeable too about Boba flavors and combinations.

Average price around $3.50."}
{"text":"Get extra bowls or a to-go container you wil need them. 

HUGE portions which scores points for me always. The food is great too. No, it's not authentic, but if you're just looking for some feel-good food come here. Portions are huge which is why it costs a bit (up to nine bucks after tax) but their best item is actuallt their cheapest the plain udon at under seven bucks after tax. 

Their udon noodles are super thick you won't miss the meat. I have very Americanized tase buds I'll admit, but to me the broth is super tasty. I put in a cup of chili oil and it's bliss in a bowl. 

Also gets points for atmosphere very clean, for just a few dollarsmore than fast food it's actually a place you can enjoy sitting in and spending time."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite ramen place. I strongly recommend the republic ramen, it has a bit of a kick to it but oh my goodness is it tasty. The portions are large, which is great for me because I love soup. The boba is fresh and delicious. The staff is always nice and food comes out pretty quickly. There are many different ways you can customize your ramen to fit your tastes! If you love ramen, or soup in general, this place is for you!"}
{"text":"My favorite local ramen joint! Very affordable for a great portion! The staff are always friendly & helpful. I eat here all the time & have never once been disappointed. I just had my leftovers for lunch today & they were delicious!"}
{"text":"Best ramen spot I've been to so far since moving to Phoenix. Just shut up and get the tonkatsu traditional style or else you'll get spinach and carrots in your ramen and wonder what went wrong in your life. Kimchi and seaweed salad were actually pretty good, too, and this is coming from a girl raised on her granny's homemade kimchi. Prices ranged about 8-9 bucks per ramen. The cashier had no idea what I was talking about when I asked about the egg ($1 extra but worth it if it's the ooey gooey-just-cooked-ebough good stuff). I was sad when it came out hardboiled, but flavor was still good (marinated in soy sauce). Definitely go here if the wait at a certain ayce kbbq joint around the corner has a two hour wait for three people, or if you're craving some great ramen."}
{"text":"Like many people, I grew up on cheap, 5/$1 Ramen noodles.  Everyone had their \"special\" way of making them in the hood and no two ways were the same.  However, until you have a real bowl of Ramen, you don't realize just how bad your version is!

Republic takes Ramen to another level.  The bowls are large, hot and stuffed with multiple fresh ingredients.  While the dine in experience is somewhat spartan, it is a perfect spot to sit and enjoy a nice lunch without the usual jammed packed scene that many University area restaurants enjoy.  The Boba menu is also a plus if you never had one - Try Green Apple."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed. Miso base with tons of veggies and noodles. The servings are huge, enough for a couple of meals for me. They have chili oil and tropical ice tea. Great lunch spot."}
{"text":"First time patron. Confused as to whether to seat ourselves or to order at the counter then, seat ourselves.  Took a while to get help for someone to take our order(at the counter).  Went really late, so other staff may have been sent home earlier.  Nice selection of noodle bowls such as ramen,  soba or udon. Didn't take long.  Huge portion, great price, good music( Pearl Jam) selection, chill guy as a cashier, food runner,  and busser. He seemed timid, but very kind.  Gyoza was deep fried; I like mine pan fried then steamed.  Dimly lit place(didn't care for). Good stuff."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a Ramen place in Phoenix, and was driving by and thought I would give this place a try. 

Well, it was worth a shot. 

To start, this is a walk-up and order restaurant, not wait-staffed. Ok. No big deal.

I asked what the house special was and they suggested:
Tonkotsu Ramen
Rich pork flavored broth.
Original Toppings
Fresh spinach  Sprouts  Scallions Carrots 
Traditional Toppings
Men-ma  Bamboo shoots  Nori  Naruto Scallions  

The broth was just ho-hum. I added some soy and sriacha to spice it up, but still, nothing great about it. Just average. 

Noodles - fresh straight from a bag, not made here.
Toppings - just sad and boring. No egg. I haven't ever had carrots or spinach on Ramen before.. but these are just bland and sad.

What I couldn't get over was how dirty the floors were. I get they are travertine and all the dirt is in the imperfections, but the baseboards, floors, everything is just really dirty and dingy. Nope. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I have only had the tea here but it is pretty good and they are open late on the weekends! This is the only boba place open till 10 pm which is about the time I find myself craving a tea:) The staff is awesome! The place is clean and newly remodeled. They have a new expanded tea menu which is nice. The boba has never been \"perfect\" though, it is always a little too chewy and somewhat over cooked. A couple of times I have gotten teas where the boba was in a big solid lump at the bottom of my glass. Not optimal. BUT over all it is a good place with a great vibe."}
{"text":"When the weather here in AZ dipped, I thought something warm would be nice. Naturally ramen sounded like it would do the trick, so i gave this place a chance. 

I ordered the Sapporo Ramen (Sweet Butter corn in miso flavored broth) with original toppings & beef. The veggies were all good except for the carrots which were past their prime. While the soup was warm and flavor was so so, i just wasn't blown away by anything. The staff was not very pleasant and seemed annoyed by all my questions with their menu. 

This place is just okay, nothing really special or unique about it."}
{"text":"Grew up on instant ramen, had ramen in New York at some hole in the wall Japanese place where we literally got seated in a closet, found out there was a ramen place south of me in Tempe.

The staff is nice and service is quick. I had a big get together here with around 15 people and everyone got served fairly quickly. As for the food itself, it's a step up from the cups of instant noodles, but nothing special."}
{"text":"This was the first place I've tried ramen, so I don't have much to compare it to, but I enjoyed my  Tonkotsu topped with pork and egg. After a few bites I definitely wanted to punch it up with some chili oil, though. The portions are large. The customer service is unfortunate, but you don't really expect much walking in seeing twice as many staff as customers chatting bored behind the counter."}
{"text":"Very average ramen with not a lot of toppings.  The boba slush drinks were also very average (would prefer if it was blended more-crushed ice texture).  The food came quick, and prices are decent. 

There are a variety of meats to choose from (to top the ramen with) such as chicken, spam, tofu, etc. and they are generous with the quantity of meat. For fast food its not bad."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times with an ex while living in Tempe a few years ago. They serve YUGE bowls of steamy, brothy ramen. I always got the pork flavor broth with pork as well as egg and naruto. They may serve too big portions though as it easily fills me up and I only eat half of it. Great to go if you have a bad cold and are congested.. also can add some hot sauce to spice it up and really drain your sinuses! Also love the attached boba cafe,  where they make a great boba thai milk tea. I'll bring someone new next time I visit!"}
{"text":"This place is kind of the chipotle of Ramen. I mean I think it's weird when I go to the counter and ask if their tonkatsu ramen comes with chashu that they say it can come with anything and you can mix and match the broths. That's ... not right. Real ramen the broth is an integral component of the dish, you can't just mickey mouse it. Most places I've gotten ramen at in California, you know all the components are thought out and at best you can add an egg and that won't wreck it.

So yeah, they'll make any variation of ramen based on what they have. At best, its better than Cup O' Noodles, I suppose. Honestly, the \"Republic Ramen\" is the only good version and I'm not crazy about soy based ramens, but it's okay. 

This place fills a hole since I want ramen, but its like going to Chipotle because you want a burrito. I suppose technically its a burro, but come on, it's not legit. It's good for what it is, but makes me miss real ramen places. And especially real tonkatsu ramen."}
{"text":"First, a public service announcement...

TONKOTSU = Pork bone. Broth that is used as a ramen soup base.
TONKATSU = Pork cutlet (breaded in panko). Something you eat over rice.

Thank you. We now return to our regular opinionated review... 

  So you just saw Tanpopo or Ramen Girl and wanted to try some
ramen from a place that specializes in ramen to see what all the
fuss was really about. You come into this place, order a bowl of
miso ramen and patiently await your meal. When the girl brings
your ramen you close your eyes and imagine yourself in some quaint
ramen shop somewhere in Japan - bullet train in the distance, 
enka playing from the shop's speakers. You put the ramen broth
to your lips and....

PPPPPPPPPPPFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!

almost spit it all back into the bowl. Instantly you're back in Tempe
- light rail in the distance, alternative rock blasting from the
speakers. The broth has not a molecule of miso flavor that your
tongue can detect. Hell, Maruchan and Top Ramen have more flavor
in their \"flavor packets\" than this sorry excuse for a broth.

  Anyway, that's sorta what happened to me more or less. Came in 
with rather high expectations and had them shattered the moment
I tasted the broth. Umm... did I order the Shoyu Ramen by accident
I wondered? If so, MISO SILLY! If I did, though, there should be 
a stronger shoyu flavor. The noodles themselves tasted ok. There 
were some slices of char siu and they were passable - meaning they 
actually had a flavor that resembles char siu. But still, this  
place wouldn't even cut it as a hospital cafe in a bad part of Tokyo.
Reading some of the other reviews, however, I guess it can cut it 
in a strip mall in Tempe on the south side of East University Drive. 
  
  I'd actually been here once before a while back and don't even
remember what I ordered - it was that good. So I came back a second
time just to make sure.

Fool Me Once, Shame On You.
Fool Me Twice, MISO STUPID!

  So I'm still hoping for a real ramen place to open up in the valley
someday. Yeah, sure, some Japanese restaurants have ramen on their menu. 
I mean an actual ramen shop that just serves ramen. Maybe yakisoba and 
udon as well but primarily ramen. One can dream, right?"}
{"text":"pretty wack soy sauce vegetarian ramen
good amount of toppings and fillings
just tasted like soy sauce soup with"}
{"text":"I'm a big noodle and ramen fan.  This is a terrific place so far.  I've only tried a couple of their dishes but have not been disappointed yet.  Their default republic ramen dish is pretty solid and has good flavor.  I'd like to get back and try some of the others.  It would be nice if they possibly offered some of their dishes with a choice of noodles but being a ramen house they specialize in that type.  Very friendly staff and great portions for the price.  It would probably be best to add extra addins but then the price does tend to go up.

All in all it's a solid place for some good ramen."}
{"text":"Perhaps I'm being harsh on literally the only ramen joint for maybe tens of miles, but this place is alright. The ramen is decent given the price. Given the taste, it's good but it's not great.

The tonkotsu broth has the characteristic richness and savory flavors, but it tasted a bit watery to me. The pork was excellent but the cuts were somewhat lean, missing the rich fattiness I had come to associate with meat in ramen. The veggies were solid and the noodles, most likely store bought, worked well in the dish. I'm a big fan of egg so I got the extra add on, but unfortunately it was cold and hard boiled, not sure if I would do it again.

If you're craving some Asian soup and want a change of pace from pho, Republic Ramen is good for that. It's a decent joint, but since I'm from an area saturated with ramen joints, I'm not sure if I'd come here alone. Would definitely recommend for parties trying something new."}
{"text":"I get the miso ramen, it's alright. I ordered my food ahead of time on the phone, he said it would take 15 mins. I showed up fifteen minutes later, pay my bill, and the girl at the register told me it would be a minute, then proceeds to go pick her nails and dick around without looking if my pre ordered food was ready. So I sit for 15 mins before going up to the counter to ask where my food is, having ordered it 30 mins ago. It was sitting on the counter the whole time. I guess she was just too busy to do her job. Going to tampopo next time fuck this."}
{"text":"The Miso ramen was really bland - we had to put a bunch of sriracha in it in order for it to have any real flavor. The chicken was in small cubes which had a strange flavor - and the noodles were a little overlooked. Just overall not what we were expecting. Would not come back."}
{"text":"If you really want flavorless, salty broth with flavorless vegetables and meats, this is the place for you. For some reason, everyone I know and their mother loves this place. I honestly do not understand the appeal. If you have ever been to a place like Wagamama, you know there is a right way and a wrong way to do a noodle soup restaurant. This is the wrong way. First, every single soup I have ordered there (and I've been more than 3 times) tasted the same. I could not remember what I had the times before I went, they were that unmemorable. The misconception that this place is healthy also is kind humorous to me. I'm sure I'm getting my weekly value of sodium every time I go there. 

I do have to mention, however, how great their squid salad, kimchee, and other small plates are. Whether they are from a jar or pre-prepared is another story, but regardless, they are good. The boba tea seems to be the thing to get here if you're not into ramen or just passing through. I'm not a connoisseur of boba teas so I will not pretend I know what I'm talking about with that, albeit I'm sure it's good."}
{"text":"this place is no where close to anything you can get in la or oc. It taste liked it came out of the bag. plain and simple"}
{"text":"Great comfort food. Takes me back to the good ol' college days with a lil pizzaz. Delicious and filling."}
{"text":"It was ok. The pork was very dry and noodles were good. I don't think we'll be going back."}
{"text":"For years I have driven pass this place , always wondering. Today me and my 6 year old ventured inside. Nice atmosphere the staff was really nice, helpful, and all smiles.The portions are big enough for 2 to share at a great price. We will definitely return. Would recommend for dates or family time."}
{"text":"Love this place! Wish we had one in Tucson. I've been here twice and both times it was amazing.  After eating here the first time, I actually crave it sometimes.

They were very accommodating to making our dishes vegan for my husband and I. The vegetable broth is very flavorful and I love the spicy mix they have by the soda fountain to add to your bowl.  

The noodles were perfectly cooked and the vegetables were very fresh! My husband tried the seaweed salad too and said it was very good.

We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"This was a nice place for a good bowl of noodles. Clean restaurant with a lot of options on the menu. The amount of food you get for the price is a fantastic value! The also had some tasty looking Sake options however I didn't get the chance to try. Lots of broth flavors, and traditional options. I will absolutely be back here next time I am in the area!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good! Had the basic udon. Reasonably priced, tasty food and the resturant is pretty cool. 4 stars because it didn't blow my socks off"}
{"text":"... They literally forgot our very simple order of two drinks. We ordered, paid, (you are forced to tip only BEFORE your order arrives). So we sat there for like 30 minutes waiting for two simple boba drinks to arrive. When 90% of the tables in the restaurant were unseated and empty (read, a Ramen place not busy at 4pm on a Monday -  already a red flag!). 

Other guests who arrived received their orders despite us arriving more than thirty minutes earlier. 

Like seriously, how do you mess up your order chain this badly? You'd have to TRY that hard just to fail. 

We spoke to staff, apparently there was a shift change.. But this still doesn't explain how you lose an order placed electronically into a Square driven point of sale system. 

Literally if it wasn't for staff offering us larges instead of smalls (I paid for small sizes) I would've just gotten a refund. For this effort by staff, I'll grant 2 stars instead of 1.

If you look up the Google metrics for this place over a one year time span, you can see this place is getting less popular. I wonder if this has impacted quality of service over time. 

As a point of fairness, my experience with Republic Ramen was not always bad. The first time I tried it in 2014 I remember the place being passable, but the last time I came here, my chicken was ice cold in a soup of Ramen noodles. 

It's sad, because I WANT to like this place again, but the establishment just keeps letting me down."}
{"text":"I had the shrimp tempura soba to go. The broth was ok but I definitely needed to add some of the spices they had there. Whatever that orange spice is, it's delicious. The shrimp tempura was VERY soggy and the sauce given with them was way too salty."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've had the shoyo ramen and the Japanese curry and both were sooo good."}
{"text":"NOT A FAN- FOOD WAS NOTHING TO WRITE HOME ABOUT. 

you are better off making ramen at home and saving money.. 
 the happy hour is they thing that made us stay and eat but even so, never again."}
{"text":"Came in for the first time and will definitely be back.  The service was excellent, clean restaurant and food was terrific!  I got the chili pepper ramen and I'm now obsessed.  The broth is so flavorful and delicious!"}
{"text":"Service is good, restaurant is clean. For $8 you can get a good portion of ramen noodles. It's a bit salty though. I ordered the tokyo style ramen with beef, which says it has a light flavored soup base. It's not at all light! Very salty and a little bit spicy. Usually I like to drink the broth after finishing everything in the bowl, but in this case its just too much sodium. They do give you decent portions of leafy vegetables and green onions in the soup. The beef itself was nothing special."}
{"text":"Always comforting with consistent quality. I like to order a big Orion and the traditional spicy pork broth with spam. Yep, spam, broth slurp in' good. Feels like a hug."}
{"text":"I'll keep it short. The employees are nice, decor is cool, the place is clean, and the ramen was not very expensive. 

So the issue is, the food is absolutely terrible. The broth has no flavor, and the ingredients are incredibly bland. It's the worst ramen I've ever had, and I really do hate to talk in extremes."}
{"text":"It took a bit to get the food and they were out of a couple things, but I know they were pretty busy. The ramen was delicious and the portion was definitely enough to make me full! Will be returning for sure!"}
{"text":"Not much places you can find ramen in AZ. Republic Ramen or Tonkatsu is great, always get one of the two. The sides are small, too small and not worth getting in my opinion."}
{"text":"The other half and I eat here fairly regularly and we love it. He's veg and I eat meat and we can both customize our meals the way we like them. Having spent time in Japan, my other half vouches for the food and approximated authenticity here. I don't know authentic Japanese cuisine per se, but I can tell you that a heaping bowl of tonkotsu, the size of my head and then some, definitely fills this big boy's belly every time. I've had the curry bowl as well as the noodles and all are excellent. The shrimp & veggie tempura are great as well and the sweet, dark dipping sauce that accompanies the fried delights also ends up in my soup, to boot. Color me addicted. The staff is young and knowledgeable, and have accommodated some very tricky dietary demands from friends of ours with very specific food allergies.  Best of all, it doesn't cost us an arm & a leg for a hugely satisfying meal. Highly recommended gem of an Asian restaurant in Tempe AZ."}
{"text":"I have heard many great things about this place and of course, I went to tempe just to try it. The place itself is very nice and very close to ASU. However, I was very disappointed. I ordered the republic ramen- traditional topping and oh boy! It was not as good as I expected! The ramen size was excellent; however, the taste, the flavor was okay- I would say passable. Simply disappointing. 

I was also excited to try their boba drink and let me tell you, it was one of the worst I have tasted! I have tried many, many boba milk tea from different locations and restaurants and this one was one of the worst! Honestly, the only good thing that I had was the seaweed salad which was very good, but again, you can just go buy a seaweed salad done exactly the same way at the Asian supermarkets. Overall, not very impressed... at all! Probably won't be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place is like the Chipotle of ramen, decent price for a casual ramen experience. I order the Sapporo ramen which is broth with corn and butter and traditional toppings with pork. Always get extra noodles because it's only an extra dollar, I would've liked my extra egg to be soft boiled but no problem with a hard boiled egg in ramen. I like to eat my ramen plain and then half way through add spices, it's like eating 2 different orders!"}
{"text":"First I will admit to not being a very impartial critic here-I absolutely adore a good bowl of ramen.  Although I've not been to Japan I've been fortunate enough to visit some outstanding ramen houses in Seattle, Honolulu, Los Angeles, Chicago, and San Jose.
While I think this is probably some of the better ramen I've had in Arizona, unfortunately that's not really saying much.  It was okay, not great.
I ordered the miso ramen with chashu hoping against hope that I'd have a reasonable facsimilie to Santouka's spicy miso available in the Mitsuwa stores around the country-drool.....  The noodles were decent, though I wish there was more of them.  The broth was not very miso-y and lacked the depth that really makes the ramen bowl.  The chashu was really the weak point, sliced thin pork with no real discernable chashu quality.  The accompanying vegetables were fine although I wouldn't say it's what I'm used to/looking for.
In short I'd say this is Americanized ramen-and no, not the cheap junk from the package but suited more for an American palate instead of leaning toward authenticity.  No fish cake or bamboo shoots, none of the cloudy unctuous broth, no pork belly chashu.
The place looks great and the staff is great, I wouldn't dismiss it but Republic doesn't get a fervent recommendation either."}
{"text":"Not very good.
They use cheap ingredients and lots of salt. Ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen with beef and they must have just thrown in some cold roast beef slices from a package. The beef was so tough and dry. Looks like a cool place but food quality doesn't match up. Teenie boppers and college kids prob think it's great but then again they eat 99 cent Ramen from Walmart and think that's good..."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place. My boyfriend and I used to happily make the trek all the way from North Phoenix on a regular basis and have never been let down!

Whenever I go out to eat in Tempe, specifically close to ASU, I expect half-ass service. I expect there to be hungover waitresses and hostesses texting when I walk up because in the past that's what I've come across. Though there are college students working at Republic Ramen, they have always been extremely helpful and have given us fantastic customer service despite the fact sometimes there's only one cashier/server at a time (usually during work hours on weekdays).

What do I love most about the food at Repulic Ramen? The variety. There are several broth choices and they are happy to switch meat out for tofu. And the bowls are packed with tons of fresh veggies. I've seen a couple of complaints on here about the broth being bland - but I've never personally had that issue. Then again, I had a sh*t ton of Sriracha because it makes already phenomenal food taste THAT much better. Anyway, the bowls are huge. My boyfriend and I share one every time. And just in case we're hungrier than we thought, we always order a side of edamame or veggie tempura (if you go during happy hour it's like $1).

But my favorite FAVORITE part of RR is their boba. On the other side of the dining room is a little cafe where they serve boba, sake, coffee, etc. I've lived in North Phoenix and now I live near Central Phoenix and boba is pretty hard to come by in those parts. I'd have to drive to Chandler or the West Valley and that just won't ever happen. I almost always order thai tea milk tea w/ boba but sometimes venture out and get a peanut butter & chocolate snow (creamy slushy) and my boyfriend likes to mix fruity flavors - they have a lot of options and you can mix any of them. Their boba pearls are always soft and they are generous with the amount they put in. I don't know about you, but I hate when I eat all the boba before I'm finished with the liquid. In this case, sometimes I find myself just eating boba pearls because I've already drank all the tea.

All in all, this is probably my favorite restaurant. Does it feel like you're sitting down somewhere in Japan? No. It's definitely Tempe. It's very open and modern. But who cares because it's delicious. Fantastic food, friendly staff, clean bathrooms/tables/everything, lots of seating, and of course, boba!"}
{"text":"I love this place, best ramen around. Everyone I have brought to this place has also really liked it as well. The republic ramen with chicken hits the spot everyone & the Boba is really good as well."}
{"text":"The shoyu broth ramen was fantastic. This totally hit the spot. I'll definitely be going back frequently in the near future."}
{"text":"They are a bit pricey but i really like the location and interior. They have good food and very friendly staff. I don't frequent too often but it's worth going to."}
{"text":"My meal and experience at Republic Ramen + Noodles was fantastic! The establishment was fairly easy to find, was clean and the people were friendly. They have an excellent menu, the prices are fair and the selection was varied. They have a decent selection of foreign beers, some of which I haven't seen since I was in Okinawa, Japan with the Marine Corps. I will definitely recommend this restaurant to my family and friends!

A solid 5 Stars!"}
{"text":"Grey meat with a a horrid flavor. The beef was so nasty I had to take it all out of my ramen. I Also Had More Bamboo THEN ramen. Wtf. Was not impressed at all the broth was mediocre and I felt robbed. I also had to clean my own table. Definitely not the best ramen or fresh made either."}
{"text":"after checking out their website, i was excited to try republic ramen for the first time. i ordered the vegetarian ramen with tofu and a few moments later, a giant, steaming soup bowl was heading my way. sadly, the bowl contained a huge portion of noodles and a disappointing amount of fresh veggies and tofu. the broth was very salty with a flavor similar to soy sauce... in my opinion, it was not at all \"exotic\" as the menu describes."}
{"text":"My vegetarian ramen was ok, my boyfriend's was way too salty for me. Ok for one visit, not enough to make me go back, however. The search for ramen as delicious as Tatsu-ya in Austin continues."}
{"text":"Taste of the ramen and broth is good! The ambient is pretty neat also. Near the asu so it had the chill college vibe. Good music playing and some tv to watch. The serving is worth the $8 average that you spend on their ramen. Would definitely recommend this place. 

PS 
They told us they didn't carry lemon/lime. Crazy lol"}
{"text":"Awesome if you like ramen...even awesomer if you like boba tea!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Reminds me of my trip to Japan. I recommend the tonkatsu traditional style. If you haven't been and like Japanese food the definitely go!"}
{"text":"I have been on the look out for a solid ramen house in the Phoenix metro area. This isn't it.

It's not bad. It's just okay. The noodles were the best part, and the staff who took our order said they special order the fresh ramen noodles from LA. The broth (I had the Spicy Republic) was also pretty good, if not a tiny bit over salted. However, I'm used to real ramen, where the bowl is rich with vegetables, herbs, bean sprouts, meat, tofu, etc.  Here, you get noodles and broth and just a few small pieces of carrot, a handful of bean sprouts, a handful of spinach, and whatever protein you choose. THEN, you can add on for $0.50 an item what is typically already in the bowl at a traditional ramen house. 

We also ordered the Japanese curry - also just okay. There isn't anything bad to say about it, but there wasn't anything to rave about either.

Cleanliness and customer-friendly service here were 5 stars - greeted when we came in, the server/cashier explained everything he knew about the menu and made pleasant suggestions. I saw him and the other server do the same thing with all of the other people waited on, so they are also consistent with their excellent service. 

I'd definitely go back, but I know what to expect now. It's a good bowl of noodle soup, but it wasn't the ramen I was craving."}
{"text":"It was a great bowl of noodles, and huge, too (the Republic Bowl or whatever it was called).  Odd that they cut the chicken into tiny cubes... try that with chopsticks!  But the meat was tender and the broth quite flavorful, and loaded with vegetables.  As some reviewers say, 'eh' -- this is not Tokyo, this is Tempe, Arizona.  Pleasant place to hang out although why does every place seem to think they need to suffuse every spare moment with soft rock music?  Good place to bring a group of friends for lunch, or sit by yourself and have a good nutritious feed."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had, I ordered a boba slush tea and I received it after I already finished my dinner and on top of that the cup was cracked and leaking everywhere. Really rude and sassy workers."}
{"text":"Love the miso ramen. Get the traditional toppings though. This place is pretty legit."}
{"text":"I ordered it for to go... it was missing half the ingredients I asked for. I guess it's my fault for not double checking but it was missing 2/4 ingredients I ordered. Little disappointment because I always order tons of veggies with my meal and I got half of it. Overall, the ramen is good... service is okay... and following an order isn't the best. Especially when you end up spending a little more to add extra items, and they weren't there. Oh, and they also didn't supply any chopsticks, sriracha, or hoison which they offer in dine in. Nor napkins. Little disappointed they didn't offer the common necessities most restaurants provide with orders like this. Whenever I get Pho to go, they always make sure I have chopsticks, napkins, sriracha, and hoison sauce just because they are typical add ons."}
{"text":"Grew up on Ramen, Udon & Soba.  So, saw the ad for this place; really wanted to try.  Ramen was very good; the broth was very flavorful.  Wish the Char chiu was more authentic to my JA taste.  My roommate tried the Soba; it was excellent.  Will be back to try the udon or the soba.  They need to have oshinko or tsukemeno as a side dish.  Maybe I'll bring my own next time...LOL"}
{"text":"I came here on Friday with a dire craving for Soba Noodles. I have never had Soba Noodles, before and I have been yearning it since watching a rerun of Iron Chef Japan the other night. Upon glancing over the menu I decided to order Shrimp Tempura Soba, $6.95 a Squid Salad $3 and bought a soda. All of which came to $15 bucks with tip. Not a bad deal at all IMO. 
I began with the Squid Salad. A more than generous portion of Squid I thought for the price. It was cooked and marinated quite nicely. Next up, the main dish. The Tempura came on the side as 2 Shrimp Tempura and a piece of Carrot Tempura. The Tempura batter was actually quite nice, no complaints there. Now for the Soba. It came in a huge piping hot bowl. The broth was very clean, fresh, and enjoyable. The Soba Noodles tasted good I thought. I can't give a comparison to other Soba Noodles though, so I don't know if they were great of terrible as far as Soba is concerned, but I had no complaints. This is one of those things where I have to try numerous Soba Noodles to make a valid argument. But as far as I'm concerned it didn't disappoint. The one odd thing I thought though was that I did not see one Japanese employee in there. Kind of quirky, but oh well. This is a solid meal at a good value."}
{"text":"Its kinda a hipster place for ramen.  I am Chinese and I seem to eat a lot of noodles nothing surprise me or wows me about noodles.  However I loved the idea of a noodle place.  I will go back and want to try some of the others types of ramen."}
{"text":"This was my first time having ramen. It had a fast food feel too it. The food and service were great. The dumplings were good. I would recommend using hot sauce to add to the flavor."}
{"text":"I am really disappointed. The ramen I ordered was so salty. Nothing really is special with the Republic Ramen Noodles."}
{"text":"You get a lot of bang for buck at republic ramen and noodles in Tempe. A large bowl of is served with each ramen dish. The bowl is heavily broth based. I was real busy after my meal. Back & forth, back & forth. I enjoyed the shop ramen. The staff was super friendly and the restaurant was clean. I'll be back again"}
{"text":"Solid spot!  Generous servings, and flavorful broths to satisfy your cravings.  I had the Tokyo ramen with pork and added an egg, corn and garlic puree.  The broth was light with just enough kick from the spice and the vegetables were very fresh.  We also had an order of gyoza and the shrimp purse.  Both were good but the ramen was clearly the star.  Next time I'm in the area I will have to make a point of stopping back in."}
{"text":"Pretty good ramen, big portions for the price... We liked the pork slices with the tonkatsu broth.  I would recommend skipping the beef slices (lacked flavor and was dry).  I will go back when craving Japanese ramen."}
{"text":"We came in about an hour before closing. Still had quite a few people eating and we were helped right away. I was very impressed with the selections they had for ramen and toppings. Started with the Edamame and the Gyoza. The Gyoza was OUT OF THIS WORLD. Really some of the best I've ever had. I had Shoyu ramen with an extra egg ($1) and it was pretty good. Very healthy portions and reasonably priced. Two orders of ramen and two apps and drinks for $30. Nice atmosphere and really friendly folks working. Looking forward to my next trip to Tempe."}
{"text":"We love how this ramen spot is open on Sundays! Great broth and good noodles, good price. Wish soft boiled eggs were offered."}
{"text":"This place is a shame; this place used to be so good. My family and I ordered tonkotsu ramen and plain udon. The udon was so salty, (the broth was so dark we couldn't even see the udon in it); we asked if we can switch it to a republic ramen. When the republic ramen came out, it was so bland and it just tasted like bean sprouts and carrots (which was the toppings on the ramen). The broth in our tonkotsu ramen was salty as well. We were only able to finish a quarter of our food because it was that bad! My son was hungry still so he really wanted to get a boba drink. It took them close to 15 mins to get us the boba; and man, it was so gross.... I was in shock and in disbelief how horrible the food and drink ended up being... the only positive experience was the staff that was nice despite being stressed out with the amount of customers coming in. They seem stressed, yes, but you can tell they were trying. I'm just so upset that we paid for dinner that was this bad. I NEVER had such a bad food experience like this before EVER... sorry republic, never again."}
{"text":"The noodle there is tasty, and the price is not expensive. But the people working there are not quite friendly. The first time I went there, the girl at the front was kinda pushy to let me order immediately, while I was still reading the menu and nobody was behind me. The second time I went there, the guy at the front was really impatient and had a long face to me. I don't think it's personally at me, since they were the same to my boyfriend. I guest they were just very unhappy people. There must be something wrong with the management."}
{"text":"I loved this place have no eaten there 2 times and with 2 different people. Both loved it also :)"}
{"text":"It's not the best but still a place I'd come back too.
I got the Shrimp Tempura Udon and felt the flavor was a bit bland. After adding a little sriracha, soy sauce and chili oil, the taste was much better.

It only came with two small shrimp tempuras and a tempura onion but for 7 buck, you can't expect much.

I'm curious to try other things on the menu, I may have just chosen poorly.

I'll probably go back. After a night of drinking, it will be a nice remedy."}
{"text":"I'm not a ramen connoisseur or anything, so maybe I'm not the best person to judge the quality of what these guys are serving. What I can say though is that it's pretty darn good, the price is right, and the portions are huge. I'm also a big fan of the service here. If you're not picky and just want something good and different, it's definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"The girl and I first came here when we are feeling a case of the sniffles and were wanting to nip it in the bud without cooking a hot soup ourselves. we came here again a few weeks ago with a friend because we enjoyed it so much.

The restaurant has a really nice atmosphere with tables for parties of any size. The food itself comes in huge portions so come hungry or share it with someone. First time I got Republic Ramen with beef and traditional toppings. Word of warning if you're not a fan of seaweed ask them to remove it or stick to original toppings. Had a good spice to it and the toppings went very well with it. Seaweed was a bit strong but that's to be expected. Downside to the traditional toppings is that if you do have seaweed with it and end up taking any home, the seaweed tends to overpower the soup to the point I couldn't eat it. So take a lesson from me and share the traditional style one in house with someone.

The second time I came here I got the Republic Ramen with chicken and original toppings. The original toppings has a lot of tasty veggies and no seaweed so would have been fine to take home if I hadn't finished it off. Only disappointment was the cubes of chicken that was in it does not absorb any of the broth and doesn't appear to have been preseasoned so the chicken itself was a little bland. Otherwise it was a great combo as well. Would just recommend sticking with beef.

The bottom line: Great food, great prices, and great atmosphere. So next time you want some great soup or are a little under the weather and want a quick fix, definitely give Republic Ramen a try."}
{"text":"Decent ramen place but not the best. They also have variety of boba drinks. Sometimes this place feel disorderly and maybe borderline dirty. Service is so so. Overal his place is just average. If you feel like eating decent cheap ramen or maybe boba drinks give it a try."}
{"text":"I'm Chinese, and I have traveled to Japan many times...this is some of the best ramen in America I have ever had! I had to move away, but while I was living there I was literally at Republic Ramen every single day. Their boba is fresh and flavorful, their edamame is perfectly prepared, and each of their ramen dishes is absolutely wonderful. My personal favorite was the miso ramen with naruto, pork, and the usual toppings with a black milk tea. Everyone who works there is super nice and chill, always friendly and courteous. 

It just doesn't get better than this!"}
{"text":"I love ramen, and am admittedly a little picky since I grew up in an area that had authentic ramen restaurants on like every block.. so, given that context, republic ramen is pretty okay. 

I got the tonkatsu ramen since you can't go wrong with that traditional flavor, and I was pretty satisfied. I also got to try the republic ramen, which was good.. (I preferred the tonkatsu broth for sure though) The noodles and toppings were okay (I got the traditional option - I love menma!!), and the size was very generous (I couldn't finish mine). Overall I'd give the food 3.5/5. 

I'd say they're a 4/5 though, just because the food comes out very quickly (I think it took like 5mi for everything to come me out!), it's very convenient, and the service is great! :)

While I've definitely had better ramen in Phoenix, you can't beat the convenience and speed!! It's worth coming here if you're hungry and looking for a fast ramen option :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I decided to try this place... And we were not disappointed. It was delicious!! Cute place, clean, and everyone who worked there was super friendly. I had the Miso Ramen and the bf had the Shoyu Ramen, both were so good! I love Ramen Noodles, this place takes it to a whole new level :)"}
{"text":"I love their Ramen soup! I always order their miso soup with spam, it's delicious! I've taken a few people here and they also like it. 

My only complaint is that in the summer it feels like it's 80 degrees in there. After eating the soup, you come out sweating! Seriously you're selling soup in 105+ weather! The restaurant should be at least a chilly 75...don't be cheap and crank that AC!"}
{"text":"Before I had visited this restaurant, ramen to me was the small packages at the grocery store which aren't that great. But at Republic Ramen, I had an opportunity to try something more authentic than those cheap packages at the store. The service was good, and the employee who helped us was very fluent in ramen knowledge. Afterwards, other employees were really nice in providing a take-home container. 

Also, the atmosphere is nice and modern in style. I would recommend this place to anybody who would like to try restaurant-style ramen."}
{"text":"I like Republic Ramen. It's a pretty good bwl of soup. I didn't say great, but it's pretty good. The noodles seem a little on the chewy side, but in general I enjoy it. Lot's of broth - not too much of the other ingredients.
  The facility is pretty good - comfortable and not cramped."}
{"text":"So so so so good! I went twice in one week for their Tokyo bowl! The portions are huge, plenty for at least two meals."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with the food.  This place uses MSG in their food and it is not possible to order the food without MSG.  This is a big turn off for me.  The dish I ordered was advertised as having carrots, onions and potatoes in it.  Ah, maybe about 1/10 of each.  There were virtually no veggies in my food and was all rice some sort of gross brown \"curry\" sauce."}
{"text":"I finally decided to give Republic a chance and boy was that a mistake.  I'll get the positive out of the way first.  I ordered gyoza, and it tasted fine but they looked and tasted like the kind you buy frozen at Asian market and throw in a wok to cook.  

The worst of the experience was the boba.  I've had boba all over the city and while this looked like boba it was the worst.  I ordered almond milk tea and there was a very strong taste to it.  I realize my description will be a little off but the best way i can describe it is super sweet (without the good taste) and it had a kick to it.  It was like the almond was in overdrive. The boba were also hard.  I don't know if they were just under cooked but after a few sips I could not drink anymore of it. 

There was nothing satisfying about this drink on a hot day."}
{"text":"Authentic ramen with superb flavor! My fiance and I moved to Phoenix from West L.A. where we frequented a place called Kinchan's Ramen. 
We visited Republic Ramen and didn't expect it to measure up to our old neighborhood favorite, but it certainly surprised us! Great taste, great value, and knowledgeable, friendly counter help to boot. Staff is happy to help you customize your order. If it is your first time having ramen, don't be afraid to consult the staff for help understanding the various flavors and options- they are super helpful and know their ramen!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for a quick lunch and wanted to catch the World Cup game between Brazil and Serbia. Food was delicious- ordered the pork broth with pork served traditional style.  It was way more than I could eat and I was super hungry. Reasonable price for two ramens and a shared large beer. The food was great, service was quick and helpful. We would return."}
{"text":"Love this place. I lived in Japan and I love to come here to reminisce about the region. They have a great range of indegrients and are super friendly. Last time I was here I had a big bowl of ramen and tempura side. The tempura wasn't cold when it was fried so it was a tad chewy. The portions are huge and bug enough to share, but I never do. :)"}
{"text":"My soup was pretty good, there was a lot of choices.  The service was a little lack luster.  I am not a ramen expert but I feel like I could do better."}
{"text":"First and foremost I made the mistake of ordering an Indian curry rice bowl at a Raman restaurant, regardless I gave it a try due to my love for Indian food.  The meal was definently a rice bowl, too much of one.  There is an overabundance of thick, tasteless white rice that dries your mouth out and gives your jaw a workout.  The curry sauce, while very savory and hearty, was so unproportionate to the amount of rice.  While the sauce was more of a gravy than a traditional curry, the stinginess of sauce left the dish a few strokes over par.  When I asked for more curry, I was told it would be another dollar.  In addition I regretfully added a side of chicken to add protein to the dish, as well as zucchini.  The chicken was so finely chopped and sparse, it seemed to amount to only about a drumstick worth of chicken.  The zucchini was raw and was pretty much tasteless.  The $12.00 price tag is not too expensive as far as restaurants go, it's a little pricey for a rice ball or a cup of noodles and broth.

An ending note, I tried the Raman broth and the two that I tried were amazing.  Also the sides looked pretty good and were about $4.  The restaurant has a fast casual chain feel to it which really pulls from the authenticity that I was expecting.

This is my first review and my dissatisfaction for this dish pushed me to finally post a review."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had never tried ramen before so we decieded to give Republic Ramen a spin. Upon ordering, we  didn't realize how big the portions were and we were starving so we ordered 3 bowls: Ramen Republic, Shrimp Tempura Udon and Chili Pepper Ramen. Let me just say these all were so good! The broth was hot and spicy and the noodles were cooked perfectly, this place is great if you're looking for comfort food! Because the portions were so large we had so much left over. I would even say a bowl could be shared between two people (depending on how much you eat). 
I should also add that the environment was very clean and open which is always a good a feeling when dining out. 
It's  a good thing I live so far or I would eat here all the time!"}
{"text":"Order at the counter, and they bring it to you.  Service is pretty fast.  They also sell a selection of Hawaiian and Japanese beers.

We really like the food here.  I recommend the Curry Rice, ask for a little extra curry.  Edamame is a great appetizer here.  The ramen also tends to be pretty good too.

There are always some seats available, and they have some patio seating too if the weather is nice.  

Great for a quick lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Just a few observations...The ramen is fine, portion sizes excellent, prices good..but a few thoughts...Maybe I am spoiled, but I love eating at different ethnic restaurants to experience the culture. I love to be able to eat at a place that transforms me to a different country without the sixteen hour plane ride. At Republic Ramen, I look around me at a place full of Asian customers placing orders with a caucasian cashier that has the food cooked by hispanics. Ironic to say the least. The chopsticks were the cheapest imaginable. You literally had to be careful about splinters. Tiny 1-ply napkins were a hassle. Instead of being transformed to Japan, you are listening to Katy Perry blasting over the sound system. You order \"Burger King\" style at the counter and get your own drinks. I paid by credit card and had to trudge through  the Iphone credit card scanner that had me first have to decide on how much tip that I want to leave. Really?? This place is good for an emergency ramen fix, but I look forward to the day when we have some authentic Japanese ramen houses to choose from."}
{"text":"We went here for a team dinner with a group from UCLA. Our group loves ramen, that's one of our things. This place is very nice and spacious, lots of room and has a modern-esque look to it. I ordered the Ramen Republic and had a taste of the Tonkatsu Ramen.

The Ramen Republic was \"spicy\" but honestly, if you're a person who loves spicy food, you're going to have to dump some of their spicy seasoning in there. Overall, I thought the taste and flavor wasn't so bad; the tonkatsu was very brothy and had a good pork flavor, the ramen republic had good flavor but wasn't spicy. I wasn't a big fan of their noodles, too hard in my opinion. Also, there are only 2 slices of pork (or any other meat)... which is simply not enough if you want to enjoy something hearty and delicious like ramen. Great thing is that they have a good portion for their ramen noodles. You can add more but it'll cost you a dollar or two! However, the taste and noodles are just not up to par with some of the LA ramen places.

The staff was extremely friendly and great to us. There was one guy who had just started that day that I wouldn't have known if he never told me. Really great service especially with a group as large as ours (~30 people).  Had a good time there though!"}
{"text":"Thank you soon much for opening a ramen place in the valley. I have had it in Vancouver, BC and Japan and alway crave it. The food is very good and the staff friendly.  I wish you guys had the fatty pork."}
{"text":"I visited Republic Ramen after getting a coupon at the Phoenix Comic Con. I was floored by the how many choices they offered in Ramen, most shops just have 3-4 options and absolutely nothing other than pork for the protein. I had the vegetarian Ramen with tofu and it was good- lots of delicious and fresh veggies- purple cabbage, chopped scallions, carrots, bean sprouts, and spinach. They have a tupperware of those wonderful red spices (I'm really not sure what they are but I love adding them to my Ramen) by the soda machine in the main dining area. Adding that to the Ramen you're able to control how much spice and how hot you want your noodles.

I am also very impressed by the beverage selection. They carry both Ashai and Ashai Black, a harder to find dark beer by Ashai, a Japanese brewery. Also they have OB a nice light Korean beer (technically a pale ale). I also sampled a boba tea for desert, their Taro is not the best I have had but it was still pretty darn good. All in all this was a solidly 4-star experience."}
{"text":"Republic Ramen had some potential, but fell short of a decent ramen experience. The counter-service eatery offers a number of vegetarian broths and bubble tea for a college town food experience. And I mean the affordable, could-be-great, but likely disappointing eating experience that is endemic of the college experience. 

It took almost thirty minutes to be served.

The edamame was disappointing. I hate to say this, but it reminded me of taking frozen edamame out of my freezer and attempting the microwave instructions for the first time.

I had the chili pepper ramen. I enjoyed the noodles and broth enough, though the dish wasn't spicy. The vegetables were not so great. They felt completely out of place, like someone had accidentally poured soup into a bowl already filled with salad. The picture says it all. Fortunately, the meal was cheap. 

The restaurant didn't seem clean, from the floors to the table surfaces. I grabbed a spoon from the central spoon repository and found it to be wet. I was hoping it was wet from washing. Even if that were true, it wasn't pleasant.

I'm still looking for a great bowl of ramen in Phoenix. Republic Ramen had plenty of business. I wonder if there are other options, or folks accept Republic Ramen for what it is: an affordable restaurant capitalizing on the young people's ramen craze."}
{"text":"Nope. Not the ramen I was looking for. We ordered Chili pepper ramen with original toppings/chicken, and tonkotsu ramen with beef/corn/original toppings. Meat on both was super bland and dry. I took a bite out of my beef and left it untouched otherwise. Corn tasted like it was out of a can. The biggest bummer were the noodles - they just tasted more like pasta noodles. Broth was decent, but nothing special. I'd say Tonkotsu was more flavorful, but felt on the heavier side. Maybe ordering all vegetarian would make it better. Doesn't even come close to ramen you get in California ramen houses and Japan. 

The only redeeming part was thai ice tea boba drink. That one was pretty good. 
Overall, we will not be coming back. I was looking for ramen and got something else instead."}
{"text":"This place is great for your ramen fix.  Nothing spectacular but the taste is right.  I recommend the fatty pork ramen, aka tonkatsu ramen.  The miso and Sapporo ramen were a bit saltier."}
{"text":"Recently went back to Ramen Republic since their soft opening.  They have added a few things to the menu and our ramen came out piping hot this time with properly cooked noodles.  

All things considered, definitely beats making Top Ramen at home and it hits the spot for a quick bowl of noodles in a tasty broth."}
{"text":"A less-than-stellar attempt at something that should be in the realms of instant noodles rather than fresh ramen. Listen, I'm all for the underdog but to cut corners and inflate prices will do nothing but hurt business in the long run. On my particular visit, they were out of pork and chicken. Really? Out of pork at a ramen house? So we opt for the spam and beef. The beef I kid you not was 3 slices of deli roast beef. I AM DEAD SERIOUS! What kind of place are you running here? I mean I understand eclectic is good at times but roast beef in ramen? The noodles were Zeppelinly overcooked and then there's the heavily MSG fortified Tonkotsu and \"Republic\" soup that lacked any depth or long simmered flavor but sufficed in the dry soup packet flavor and an induction of food coma the makers of Ambien would show devout interest in. Overall, there's an aberrant discontinuity of flavors here at this establishment and I was unimpressed and unmotivated to come again. Either cut your prices (after all you're in college-town) or pack up your soup packets and take it elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner after a race at Tempe town lake after a long day without a real meal all day. I've been to 3 other ramen places in california, and this place was decent. I loved the ramen noodles cause they were cooked to my liking, not too chewy. The salt broth was pretty good, but there wasn't too much else in it like the other places I've been. I had the beef and it came with about 4 thin slices of overcooked meat, a good amount of beansprouts and spinach, and 3 small slices of carrots cut into flowers. Then again, it was only about $7 each ramen bowl, which was pretty large, and you could add extra toppings from $.50 - $1 (including extra noodles which left my friend's bowl nearly overflowing). The other places I've been are about $10 for a large bowl. 
Service was great, they came to check on how we were all doing and if we needed anything else. My only complaint is that about 20 out of 50 of us were asked to wait as the kitchen closed for a bit, even when we made reservations for our whole group well ahead of time. So most of them ended up grabbing food elsewhere.
This place was pretty good, so I'd recommend it if you were to come with a regular sized group."}
{"text":"Just Ok. I'd had better ramen before. The food is ok for the price. They don't really put too much stuff in your ramen. It's pretty much basic ramen."}
{"text":"Coming in from out of state and I was craving good ol' tonkotsu ramen.  Found this place on yelp.  I am going to try to be as constructive as possible.  So here goes it: I ordered a tonkotsu ramen and it did not hit the spot. Their broth needs flavor other than just salty. Where was the pork flavor?  The charsui pork needs to be simmered more to make it tender. Perhaps they can use some mushrooms, non-intrusive veggies and aromatics to wake up the flavor to make it a true charsui. Also work on a finishing sauce to add to the bowls of ramen shortly before serving. There's a good market out there for them.  I hope they can significantly improve on their products. Republic - that word sets high expectations."}
{"text":"I got the tonkotsu ramen and an order of gyoza to-go; the ramen was decent (would probably be better dine-in), and the gyoza was cold. I live a mile away from the restaurant, so I don't think it got cold on the way home. Other than that, they were pretty tasty. I''ll be back."}
{"text":"This type of Ramen noodle is not what I prefer but I didn't want to downgrade them for that simply because of my preference. The noodles are thick and kind of remind me of spaghetti. Not a bad thing, just not my preference. HOWEVER, the broth was just the right amount of spice and full of flavor, FANTASTIC! I got the republic Ramen-- their most requested. 

The facility was clean and the staff was very nice:)"}
{"text":"Republic Ramen ... has a great casual but modern/tasteful atmosphere... the delicious generous portions of ramen is served by friendly, helpful and happy staff!!  The Boba is great.... it's difficult to describe, but to me it is like a dreamcicle with big tapioca bubbles in it!  The ramen is amazing... it has great taste and made to your special request of spiciness/ seasoning.  Having never been to an official real ramen restaurant, I can say my experience was very positive.  Definitely recommend this restaurant...."}
{"text":"Bug in my soup!!!!! The last thing I wanted to find in my soup for sure. And I'm pregnant so now I'm worried about the possibility of me consuming pesticides. Not okay! Offered to make me a new one but I couldn't even stomach the thought. Got our money back and walked right out and will never be going back."}
{"text":"I used to go here all the time. It is fast, cheap and close to work. It also had gluten free vegetarian soup....Until they got new management!!! The new management decided to discontinue the gluten free option, ultimately disenfranchising those of us with gluten allergies!! You lose my business & many more customers with similar issues. If it isn't broken don't fix it!! That is alright I will & have taken my business elsewhere & have encouraged others to do so."}
{"text":"This is a must try.  Rich broth, fresh noodles, and fresh toppings.  You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I love getting ramen here. The tonkotsu is my favorite. I try to go over here everytime I'm in the area. Although their boba is not the greatest because the boba is hard instead of chewy compared to other places I've been.  I would get boba elsewhere instead of here. Overall it's a very good place."}
{"text":"I was passing by Tempe, AZ on my way back to California, and I was in the mood for some Ramen.  I searched in Yelp and the only one I could find is this place.  The place look clean and high tech, it looks impressive.  However, you can't judge a book by its cover.  I don't why they call their soup ramen apart from the noodle that they used.  It's so bland; well, if they were honest they should just call it noodles, and vegetables with soy sauce, but definitely don't call it Ramen because it is not.  If you ever tasted Ramen from Asia or if you visited Southern California, and had some Ramen, I would highly recommend that you stay away from this place."}
{"text":"I discovered this place driving around Arizona State trying to find a cheap place for lunch.  As a ramen lover, it's difficult to find a good ramen place in the valley.  So when I saw a ramen place, I thought I'd try this one out.  Walking in gave me a hip trendy vibe.  It's definitely college friendly.  A modern look.

The menu has everything you'd expect in a ramen shop: regular ramen, spicy ramen, seafood, and vegetarian.  But the star of the show is definitely the Tonkotsu ramen.  Even the cashiers would recommend this choice.  It's a milky pork stock soup.  I ordered it with chashu (Japanese soysauce marinated) pork and egg.  The ramen was cooked perfectly: bouncy and not soggy.  The thinly sliced pork had just enough fat to be tender and flavorful.  When they served it, it came with bean sprouts and spinach.  Everything came together with the help of the broth.  Adding a bit of the red pepper gives it a good kick, but it doesn't overpower the flavor of the soup.

I definitely recommend anyone with a passion for ramen and Japanese food to try this place.  For those who are indecisive or unsure what to order.  Repeat after me to the cashier: Tonkotsu ramen with chashu pork and egg please!

5 star only b/c of the Tonkotsu."}
{"text":"Does the Republic Ramen cure the common cold? According to a friend endearingly known as Asian Bob it does.

After a short weekend in Seattle, I came back with the sniffles. Two weeks later and I'm not sure if it's a flu or allergies. Either way, my congested sinuses left me sounding a little like Elmer Fudd. Enter Asian Bob and his spicy remedy to clear out the last of this seasonal sickness.

I hadn't heard of Republic Ramen + Noodles located next to the Phoenix Rock Gym on Dorsey & University. I was surprised at the mod and clean layout - a far cry from the pizza place that used to be here. The staff knew exactly what I needed and soon a huge bowl of ramen was sitting in front of me.

I loved that it was full of spicy broth. It wasn't the hottest thing I've ever eaten, but over the next 12 hours it worked its magic. The next morning I woke up with a clear head and normal voice.

Thanks Republic Ramen!"}
{"text":"Got the veggie ramen to go. Sounded good, with its \"exotic vegetables\". Well, exotic vegetables turn out to be spinach and cabbage. Ooooh, wow! The noodles were in a separate container as I ordered to go. When I dipped into the noodles, a distinct smell that I can only describe as \"fart smell\" came from the noodles. The chicken tastes like it's been in the fridge for a week. No thanks."}
{"text":"Ordered the Miso Ramen-Traditional w/Spam. Very tasty, ramen is delicious. A bit too much bamboo shoots. Also ordered the Vegetable Tempura-batter was a bit thick & serving small (4 pieces for $4).  Service is a bit lacking, but it was after the lunch rush. Tables could have been cleaned better. Overall pleased with the ramen & will come back to try the other offerings."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed it and it's good but the broth could use more work. It's a tad on the bland side. But overall it's delicious and way better than the 5 for $1 packaged stuff you get in the store.  I got the Republic Ramen bowl with chicken."}
{"text":"This is a very large facility, the food was very good. It's in a great location next to the freeway. We enjoyed our visit here."}
{"text":"Wow this place is bad. Super overpriced...I paid 15 dollars for shrimp tempura and it came with three small shrimp. What the? Also i asked for extra corn and i didn't get anything it was literall two spoonfulls of corn. Horrible."}
{"text":"firstly, they get 2 stars cause of the good effort and the sincere service of the wait staff, who are obviously anime fans and like all things Japanese :) but seriously, very attentive and good service, only reasoin why i give them 2 stars

overpriced and very average broth.  For like 7 bucks u get 3 thin slices of \"char-shiu\" , some sprouts, some golden mushroom and decent amt of noodles.  But realy, its 2 bucks to add 3 more slices of char shiu ?  and like 1 dollar to add sprouts ?  come on, thats a rip off.  

The only reason U go here is if u are too lazy to drive to somewhere better and really must have a hot bowl of ramen.  In this case I guess U can settle for this, but if U just want soup, go down to Khai Hoang on Apache and Mcclintock and U get much much better and more ingredients soupy broth noodles.

Dun go here for ramen if U can, go to like iKitchen or Sushi Ken, either one will top this place hands down."}
{"text":"Udon is okay. Stick to Ramen only here. Tempura was cheap and bad breading. Don't bother with it. 

Boba is hard. Not worth it. 

Again ramen is the only ever worth getting."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my food and will likely go back.  It is a good/simple thing to feed to the kids as well.  For $6.95 you get a huge bowl of ramen.  I got the vegetarian one with tofu.  They also have rice (gluten free) noodles.  Add a bit of the sarrachi sauce and it was tasty.  I couldn't finish the whole bowl.  Perhaps that has something to do with the $2 happy hour plate of vegetable tempura I ate... or the chocolate strawberry snow with boba that I had.  The boba is not as good as the one from The Boba House in Chandler.... a tiny bit dry in the middle.  Also, I had ordered a coconut strawberry drink and they accidentally made chocolate strawberry.  I didn't mind and drank it anyway.  Kinda wished I had the coconut instead but it was still good."}
{"text":"Went there after living in Tokyo for 5 years. I wasn't expecting Japan-grade ramen but I was hoping that it would be OK. The ramen was a step up from cup ramen. I got the tonkotsu ramen with traditional toppings and egg. It was not tonkotsu at all. The taste was weak and salty. I might as well have gotten salt flavor because that's what I got. The egg was over cooked with a black ring and just crumbled when I tried to eat it. 

After I bought some of their boba. I ordered the almond milk tea and it was sticking sweet. Almost tasted like banana milk with a odd after taste, but I could have drank it if it wasn't for the boba itself. It was hard, like I expected the center to be dry it was so hard. It is the worst boba in AZ. Do not waste your money!"}
{"text":"I don't know how I haven't written a review here! I've been here a few times and ever since umami closed I've been here once, to get a ramen fix. I've tried a lot of the broths and they're all missing something and usually pretty salty, I think the best one is the tonkatsu, but in saying that I guess I'm being very light when I say \"best.\" I usually get the traditional toppings, and two eggs, but I'm sad they don't do soft boiled eggs. They have a decent beer selection and other appetizers that I cannot comment on. Service is whatever, you order at the counter and they bring the food out to you. Everything else you get yourself. It's a large place which is nice, so you don't feel so squished in... I just wish they would step up their flavors a bit."}
{"text":"I ate a bowl of udon and wasn't really that thrilled. But I used to work near this place and it's a very popular spot it just isn't suited for my tastebuds maybe."}
{"text":"If I could give 6 stars, I would!
The only downside is the wait to get our food but it was worth the wait.
I had the basic ramen with a spicy broth, veggies and chicken. If the broth wasn't so hot, I would've drank it all down. I took home leftover soup (portions are gigantic) and it was just as delicious the next day.
I will be back over and over!"}
{"text":"I knew this place had the best ramen in AZ, but yesterday I tried their curry with chicken. It's a killer! Great curry, big chunks of chicken all resting on a volcano of rice. Enough for 3 meals and the best I've had. Serving in a huge black stoneware bowl makes this scrumptious dish look like a volcanic island in a sea of mild Japanese curry."}
{"text":"I was surprised to find that this is a rather trendy and expensive ramen shop, rather than your classic hole in the wall ramen soup joint. There was a huge line and wait while we were there. The meals are ordered and paid for at the register and then a staff member will bring it to your table afterwards. Unfortunately, while this place is pretty and pricey, the cheap hole in the wall ramen that I've had was much better. The food here was pretty good, but between the line, wait, and price, I don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Best noodle experience! First timer and I'm impressed! Great menu, boba is yum, and environment is very chill. I'll be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Truly, I've experienced better.

As other Yelpers have noted, I am sure this place has improved quite a bit since it first opened. What I found most off-putting from my first couple of visits, though, was the service! I sincerely value good service, and good service wasn't what my friends and I received at Republic Ramen.

To play devil's advocate, I usually do go to Republic Ramen with rather large groups of friends. I can see how this can get to be overwhelming, with 15+ hungry adults placing orders and demanding food right away. I just felt like some of the staff could have been nicer/less rude/more attentive?

The food was also...okay. I didn't think they were particularly memorable dishes in any way. Same goes for the boba tea shop next door (which is part of the same restaurant, I believe).

I might give Republic Ramen another shot--this is one of the closer ramen shops in my area, so I definitely want to give it anther go. I do hope the experience is more enjoyable this time around."}
{"text":"I'm a big foodie, and I love noodles, my single favorite dish in the world is Pho. Ever since learning about real ramen, I've been dying to try it. I chose to get the Shoyu Ramen with pork and egg topping. It was actually really good. A little heavy on the sprouts and spinach, but overall really good. Paired it with a Fire Rock beer (probably should have got boba). I can't compare it to anything else, since this was my first time, but I would have it again, trying miso or shio. However, the ramen here doesn't hold a candle in the wind to a hot bowl of Pho. On a side note, if you're really into ramen, watch Anthony Bourdain's episode about it, Ramen Girl with the late Brittany Murphy, and read David Chang's first issue of Lucky Peach magazine."}
{"text":"As one of my regular take out stops, Republic Ramen never disappoints. They have such a wide variety of flavor and it's great to have your choice of meat (I recommend the tofu - it goes well with everything!) They also have a great deal on drinks and really inexpensive edamame at Happy Hour."}
{"text":"I was craving for ramen before we fly back to Los Angeles. My husband found Republic Ramen through Yelp. I ordered the Republic Ramen with traditional toppings and tofu, my husband ordered the Tokyo Ramen with original toppings and beef. It was very good!!! Generous portions for the price and in big soup bowls. We come to AZ for fun and business several times a year so Republic is on our \"must eat\" list."}
{"text":"I have never had REAL ramen until I came here. I had been raised thinking ramen was just noodles in a package that you boil for 3 minutes and add the contents of a silver packet (predominately made of sodium), and voilà! 

This place is fantastic delicious offering ramen, udon and rice dishes with fresh ingredients for about 6.50 an item. The servings are absolutely huge, but fantastic.  

My boyfriend and I tried this place out on a Saturday night a few weeks ago. It was quiet inside, but the cashier explained they just finished with their dinner rush.

I ordered the miso ramen and my boyfriend got the curry rice with a side order of goyoza. There were three goyoza to an order, and to be honest, they were small for the price.  The miso ramen and the curry rice were both very good. 

We went there a week later (due to a hankering of mine) and decided to share a bowl of the republic ramen along with edamame and veggie tempura. All of it was delish. 

The only downside to the restaurant is that it smells like a grease fryer.  When we left, our clothes stank like grease.   

Other than the smell of grease, the place is fantastic."}
{"text":"Taste so cheap, so disappointed. Worst ramen place in the Arizona! I visited on sunday night and waited for 30 min to get my plate. My bf got miso and i got Tokyo and both were really bad. Taste so fake n unnatural. Meat is super thin and broth is so weird. Dont know why i have to give the servers a tip cuz they never showed up, literally never. Water machine doesnt have ice, and boba machine is broken. Not sure if they want to do a business or what. Wasted $21.
** they dont have tacoyaki on the menu
** i believe they can buy some better spoon
** save ur money. tip is wasting"}
{"text":"We had an order of vegetable tempura, vegetarian traditional ramen and curry rice.

The tempura battered vegetables consisted of onion, sweet potato, zucchini, and a carrot with a sweet dipping sauce.

The rice was not fried, but steamed in a wonderful and moderately spicy curry gravy. Very filling, very fresh.

The star of the dinner, the ramen, had a strong dark vegetable broth complimented by a rainbow of beautifully cut vegetables, green onions, tofu and seaweed. The noodles were on point. 

The best part of the dinner, was the very reasonable price. We spent $20 roughly for two people which included our drink we shared."}
{"text":"You order with a grouchy blonde college girl using an ipad2- but they cant afford to actually put toppings on your ramen. 

I will go until someone recommends better ramen places in Phoenix. I'm from San Francisco (Can I make that bold?) so I'm not impressed with oily/watery tonkatsu topped with 2 measly pieces of thinly sliced cold tough pork. 
Its not bad ramen, but this isn't how it is supposed to be done.  
The product should match the photos on the website at the least... It does not."}
{"text":"I loved my ramen! I was able to mix the broths to get exactly what I wanted. They had such a great variety of broths and add ins. Their kimchi is also off the charts!!"}
{"text":"This time, I only ordered a boba milk tea, and I was completely underwhelmed. The tea itself tasted like my first attempt making my own milk tea when I was in middle school; I had to concentrate extremely hard to discern the faint tea flavor.

However, the boba's texture was definitely on point."}
{"text":"I went to Republic Ramen + Noodles because my friends were hungry. Since I already ate dinner before meeting up, I decided to simply order an edamame and a boba. 

I would have given this place two stars for the food. I do not recommend ordering the edamame or the boba here. I usually love sweets, and will leave good reviews for bobas, but I was surprised that I could be turned off so much by the taste of boba here... the boba itself was undercooked and hard, and the almond milk tea tasted saccharine-awful. The edamame was filled with salt - I spent a lot of time wiping off the salt with a napkin. So, why the two stars for the food? I tried some soup of my friend's Tokyo Ramen and the broth was alright. She said that the ramen was salty but okay. If you end up going here, do yourself a favor and just order the ramen. 

The reason why I gave this place one star, rather than two, was because of the lackluster service. We waited a very long time for our food (how long does it take to make boba and an edamame?), and when my friend asked where her food was, the server wasn't very helpful. We went in a group of three; one of my friends and I got our orders first (we waited about 30-40 minutes for the food; the edamame and the bobas came out at the same time as the Tokyo Ramen), and my other friend had to wait about an additional 15-20 minutes before her ramen arrived. Also, off-topic but the bathroom seemed unclean.  

Although the Tokyo Ramen was okay, there are tons of other restaurants with better food and better service. I will not return, and I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've come here twice now and have really enjoyed it both times. I have stuck with the chili pepper ramen and tried it with chicken, then beef - the beef is better. The broth is so flavorful, the vegetables are crisp and colorful, and I wish I could eat this every day!"}
{"text":"If you even remotely know what Japanese Ramen tastes like ... steer clear of this masquerade.
Even Kabuki's flaccid attempt at Ramen outshines this mess. 

Venture down to Tompopo for a true introduction to Ramen, a bit further down the culinary road in Chandler you'll find Nishikawa. However if  you want to taste the \"real deal\" a road trip to Monta's in Vegas is in order. The nearest serious attempt at a authentic bowl of Japanese Ramen.

Happy Trails!"}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad...just not that good. 

Service was a little bad, I took my buddy here for ramen after his recent move back from Japan....and after having to ask a few times for stuff, and then them making some juice(?) close to wear we were sitting, in the bar, it was so loud we had to continuously stop our conversation until they stopped- we both decided never to come back. 

Such a shame..."}
{"text":"Republic Ramen with traditional toppings, pork, and egg tasted very good! The broth had just the right amount of spice. Also got their 4 sake flight that came with edamame, all of which wasn't bad. Also tried their black tea boba which was decent. Very quick and efficient service on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"What an abomination! For soup noodles its pretty decent but please don't advertise it as ramen. Its more like instant ramen that you can get for 75 cents with tiny bits of meat that you end up paying 8 dollars for. If I can make it better at home then we have a problem..."}
{"text":"The ramen noodles were awesome, thick and chewy. I'd order extra next time. I've had better tonkatsu broth elsewhere, but this will do in a pinch."}
{"text":"It's a weird thing:  The food here isn't good and since it's a ramen place, you get soooo much of it.  I hate wasting food, so I eat it all, and I'm forcing myself to eat this shit that's super bland and I'm like, \"Man.... this sucks.\"  And it's hot so I'm sweating from that and just shoveling food I don't particularly enjoy into my mouth--not that it's gross, but because someone served it and went, \"Shit!  I forgot to add anything to it to make it taste like stuff!  Oh, well.... too late now.\""}
{"text":"I love this place! I'm just upset I waited till the end of my internship to eat here. I also love their variety of boba. Would definitely come here again when I'm in Tempe again for both the ramen and boba."}
{"text":"For Arizona- 4 stars, 3 stars if compared to L.A.

My b.f.f., seriously I've known her since I was 5, wanted to show me this place. She knows I love ramen and warned me ahead of time that it wasn't L.A. standards. We walked in for lunch right when they opened. She ordered me a tonkatsu ramen with spam.

One of her two friends that had joined us said, \"really, spam?\" \"Um.... yeah, you know, the canned meat? There's even spam rolls in Hawaii, musubi. Did I just blow your mind?

The boys were talking about chess and I mentioned I was in a chess club in elementary school. They both looked up startled and Jenni started laughing and said, \"Yeah, she's a big nerd and I used to balance her out, but I lost control over this when she moved to LA\". Now she does things like book clubs and Yelp. 

I endured what seemed like endless questioning on all things Yelp. \"What do you do on Yelp? Will you be reviewing our house later? Can we find you on Yelp and leave comments?\" 
Ah.... Arizona...... need I say more?

So back to my ramen, definitely not traditional, average noodles, and broth lacked depth. They did get the saltiness right and overall the taste was decent. I liked their space- clean, high ceilings, big windows, and modern decor. Worth a revisit when I'm in the desert and have 400+ miles between me and LA ramen."}
{"text":"If you're trying to decide on a place for ramen, and you've ever dined at Ippudo, Naruto, Minca, or Totto in NYC and thought they had good to fantastic ramen, you will NOT like Republic. 

I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen with pork (you get a choice of meat) and an egg, and a lychee green tea with boba. The ramen was not complex at all, and really just tasted like salt. And the noodles looked and felt and tasted packaged, sooo not worth the calories tasty at all! The pork was tough and chewy and not tender at all, and there were so many fatty bits that were inedible that I wish I had opted for tofu. I liked the spinach, which was out of place but flavorful.

The bubble tea was AWFUL for the first few sips, which alternated between bitter and chemical-sweet, but after I let it sit for 15 minutes it was better. The boba were a little too hard/dry on the inside, but it was towards the end of the day so maybe they were just sitting around for a while? Considering how hard it is to find boba around this town, I'm not complaining-I would go back and try another flavor, but I wouldn't have high expectations.

Look, if you want soup with noodles, this place will do. But if you want RAMEN, with rich, complex broth that isn't overly salty, with tender pork and handmade noodles, I would skip this place. With enough hot sauce, it was definitely edible, but it wasn't what I was craving (since I was craving ramen)...and so I am disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!!!

The bowls of Ramen are HUGE! Its cheap too!"}
{"text":"Craving ramen and this place hit the spot. Got Tokamatsu soup with chicken. It was not crowded. Love the reggae music."}
{"text":"Love their veggie tempura udon, I get it with pork broth. Mmmmmm! Best tempura I've had."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Every time I come back to Arizona I try to make sure and eat here at least once! Great ramen, the coconut boba is to die for and I love that you can go with traditional or more American style toppings on your ramen. Mmm I want it right now!"}
{"text":"I really have become a fan of this place. I have tried a couple different soups (although like a few others when ordering miso got somethings else once), the gyoza, boba and coffee.

Everything is very tasty I just love the beef Republic ramen with a bit of sesame chili oil added. For the price it is a good filling meal and when you add the $1 off coupon from the campus discount books its perfect. The gyoza are great crisp but not too crisp and the flavor and the flavor of the sauce is great and at 3 for $2 not a bad little side dish with the soup.

They also make a pretty good mocha which I tried the other day and the boba's are fun but I have only had the thai tea version.

The staff here is very good too they are super helpful if you aren't sure what you want, get things out quickly, if its not packed check in on you (rare for a counter order place) and they are just good all around."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years. Always enjoyed their Snow bobas, their snow bobas have milk. They also have a slushy which is just ice no milk. When I ordered my snow boba this time after a 25 minute wait for 2 drinks, it was a slushy. I asked the guy why it did have any milk and his response was they have never made it with milk. I asked him then what the difference was between a snow and a slushy? He told me that a snow just had more Ice. The guy was no help and wouldn't remake it. I was very confused and disappointed because I have been coming here for years and have never gotten it this way. In the end I had to just leave with my incorrect drink. 
I will be going somewhere else next time"}
{"text":"This is the second time we have come to Republic Ramen, and the last. The food was delicious, until a German COCKROACH climbed down the wall towards our table. We killed it, and about ten minutes of trying to decide what to do, out comes another one!!  
We told the employees and their response indicated that they were not surprised by the information.
Disgusting. And completely unacceptable.
There were ten of us dining there today that will never be back."}
{"text":"I love this place.. I get the vegetarian Ramen and I add zucchini and extra noodles. So good! I come almost once a week"}
{"text":"Very good udon noodles, strongly reccomend the chocolate peanut butter slush. Service wasn't phenomenal but they were busy until they closed."}
{"text":"I had to update this review and the reason I lowered the rating of it isn't due to the food, quality of food or anything like that. They lose 2 stars on the simple fact that for the past 5 times I've been there they f*** my order up. And what the f*** up isn't even a huge deal so I just can't wrap my head around why it keeps happening. 

I always order the Sapporo ramen. It's SUPPOSED TO come with butter and corn in it already. And then I just add all the extras to it. It's there, on the menu, clear as day that the Sapporo ramen SPECIFICALLY comes with butter and corn. So when I place my order I ask for the Sapporo ramen, add egg and naruto. EACH AND EVERY time I get my order and all the extras I asked for are in there...but no butter or corn. Who the hell is working back there in the kitchen to get it wrong EVERY...SINGLE...TIME?!?! Not every now and again...but EVERY SINGLE TIME...

I can bet you $50 right now...that I'll walk in there, order it...and it will be wrong. I can 1000% guarantee it will be wrong.

I know what a lot of people are saying...\"What's the big deal? Just ask for butter and corn...\" Which, yeah sure...I would (actually I have to anyway since they won't give it to me to begin with)...
But why should I HAVE to ask for something to be added to a soup that THEY put on the menu saying should already be in there?!?!? What ever happened to quality control??? Or can I safely assume that no one just gives a f***?

Here's an idea...just take it off the menu. You can't seem to get it right away...so save me the trouble of having to get angry about it later and just remove it off the menu."}
{"text":"1st time I went, the place was great. The second time around wasn't as good. Felt like I could've made the same thing at home. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt, though. The place was packed and looked a bit under staffed. Definitely would still give it a try."}
{"text":"First time here and really liked the food. The only reason for just 3 stars... The bathroom was disgusting. Told the guys at counter and all I got was sorry. Then he continued do his thing and never saw him tell anyone or go to check. Hope the kitchen isn't cleaned, or not, by the same crew. 

We had Sapporo Ramen and miso ramen. All excellent.  Other than the no-rush cleaning bathroom dude, the rest of the staff was friendly and very helpful in choosing what/how to order. Huge servings and had to take rest home. 

I will give it another try for sure. Will hit bathroom at home before."}
{"text":"I had seen this place for months, and me and my friends finally stopped in for a try. It was pretty good!
When you first walk in the doors it looks very modern. The menu is right behind the register in big print, you order, then sit down and wait to be served. The portions they give are fair to their prices (although the add-ons for the ramen are a little expensive) and you definitely feel full once you're done with your bowl. I tried the miso ramen and I enjoyed it.
A couple things I didn't like; The boba tea. It's alright. I had gotten almond milk tea, and at first taste, it was weird. I could only taste the almonds and milk, hardly the tea, and the boba was very, very chewy. Eventually the drink grew on me a little more, but I have doubts on trying a milk tea again off their boba menu.
Another thing, and this was just me personally- I had gotten miso ramen with tofu, but the tofu wasn't really satisfying. I was expecting the tofu to have warmed up and absorbed more of the miso flavor, however it was lukewarm, and just tasted like tofu. But thinking about this later, I realize that it's not miso soup with tofu already in it, they only put the tofu in when requested. But that was something I found a little disappointing.
One final thing: I wasn't sure if I should tip or not. they bring out your food and take your plates away, but I hadn't seen anyone else in the restaurant tip, nor anyone at my table. I had tipped anyway, but I completely lost on whether I should have or not.
This was actually very close to only getting 3 stars, but I'm giving it 4 with the benefit of the doubt that I'll try it again and like it even better next time."}
{"text":"Very classy, casual feel. I love that it is family friendly. They were quick. Great prices and decent portions. Traditional style really was that. You should always get extra meat, it was not much. But there were plenty of noodles. The squid salad was not the greatest."}
{"text":"Delicious soup with lots of options at a great price, in a cute little shop.  

Super nice service - they split our soup into two bowls (the portions are huge, and we were going somewhere afterwards so we couldn't take home leftovers).  

My husband and I split a bowl of the vegetarian soup with additional corn (a really good add), and it was yummy, especially with some soy sauce and spice from their fixins area (they also have sesame oil, yum!).  We also had a little portion of edamame ($1 at Happy Hour)."}
{"text":"This is a bit further than we usually go, but we happened to be nearby and a friend had told us about it.  I see reasonable ratings on Yelp so we decided to try it.

As the name implies, this is a noodle house.  They have soba and ramen, at the minimum.  They also had at least one rice bowl (curry).  We ordered one of each; that is one ramen soup bowl and one curry rice bowl.  I added chicken to the curry (it's meat-free otherwise).  Yes, they charged extra for that.

The verdict?  It was fine.  The curry was a darker curry but had the classic Japanese curry flavor.  It was good.  The ramen soup was OK.  Nothing special.  The noodles were properly cooked (not hard, not mushy).  The flavor didn't 'wow' either one of us.  It was fine, but not great.

I would not make a point of coming here, especially all the way from Chandler or Gilbert.  If I were in the area and had a craving I'd be willing to stop by again.  But it won't be a dining destination."}
{"text":"Soooooo goooood!!!!!!!!!!! My fiance and I went here for the first time a couple weeks ago. The girl at the counter was extremely helpful in explaining their options, and you get soooooo much soup for the price! I have to admit, i liked my fiance's better, so i'm definitely going to try it next time. I had the house broth, and it was very good, a little spicy. He had the broth that was a little more milky and it was very good, especially after adding a little sriracha. I highly recommend them if you're in the mood for some delicious comfort food."}
{"text":"Food=awesome
Ambiance=regular
Service=hit and miss (most employees are normal, but this time, cool guy taking order was as inviting as a rape van)."}
{"text":"This place used to be amazing under previous ownership. It's still okay but significantly different from the hot tattooed hipster dudes that were here before. The chicken was braised overnight, true bone broth, and an amazing soy chili broth. I still go now and again for the comfort of a big bowl of soup on rainy days but that's about it. Now the Tonkotsu and the Republic Ramen are still okay, but not amazing like they once were. The boba and Sno actually are pretty good so there's that but they don't seem proud of it. There is a whole other side of the restaurant dedicated to boba and Sno but it is never really brought to light. In fact, this side seems to be where the employees keep their backpacks, open laptops, and food/drinks from lunch breaks or whatever. 

If anyone knows where the prior ownership went and if they still make ramen, please share."}
{"text":"Not a \"real\" Japanese ramen, but pan-Asian, and it does a pretty good job.  Big portions.  They need to refine their various ramen broth options.  I had ordered \"Shio\", which is usually a light colored broth flavored with salt or \"shio\"(Japanese for salt).  The broth of the ramen I got was dark colored as a \"Shoyu\" (soy sauce) broth would be.  It seemed like they used their basic \"Shoyu\" broth, and added salt to it  - which made it very, very salty :-(
Sad to say, but that ain't authentic shio ramen broth...

But the chasiu, roast pork, tasted like it should be.  Wished that the bean sprouts and spinach were blanched as they are in Japanese ramen.  Having uncooked bean sprouts thrown in makes it a little too crunchy for my taste.  The noodles were cooked well.

Definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"A non-Asian acquaintance had recommended the Udon in this place as he onced lived in Japan.  I said, \"What the heck!  I'l give it one more try.\"  Well I ordered the Republic Udon with added Beef Slices.

On my first sip, I nearly choked coughing.  What the heck?  It seems they tried to resolve the flavor problems of the soup in the past by adding tons of salt.  There was no extra flavor just extremely salty.  The beef slices were decent.  I tried to tough it up and once again sip the soup .. but to no avail.  My body was complaining violently.

I asked the cashier if they had a lighter broth but she said that all the soup bases were the same and that they could give me vinegar to lighten the taste.  This is not a solution so I asked for a refund, of which she gladly did without complaints and apologized that I didn't like it.

The two stars are for the good customer service.  Tons of non-Asian college age people eating here.  I guess they like it.  To each their own.

I went and bought a bag of Nongshim noodles at the Oriental Market.  Way better for under 2.00. :)"}
{"text":"I am a HUGE ramen fan...came to Phoenix for a quick 1 day visit and had to try the ramen in AZ.  Following the reviews on yelp, i decided to give this place a try.  Big mistake.  Ok, it's not horrible - but ramen is hard to mess up on.  I have had really really good ramen and this is nothing even close to it."}
{"text":"I've been now twice to Republic Ramen + Noodles for lunch and the first time was good but the second was much better! The first visit the friendly guy at the counter went thru the menu and I asked what his favorite was and it was the Tonkotsu and so I got that and had beef and chicken. The bowls are VERY large so I was shocked (even though they do have a bowl at the register to show you it looks very different full). Since it was so large he package the rest up for me to go. I also had a very yummy Boba on that visit as well.

The second visit I had the Republic Ramen which was spicy but VERY good. I opted not to get any meat in the noodles this trip as all bowls include Spinach, Sprouts, Scallions, Red Pepper and Carrots that was all I really wanted. This was so good I didn't have any left overs to take with me. 

I will for sure go back and try a few other dishes and more Boba drinks!

The decor is very simple and clean so that is another plus in my book!"}
{"text":"I am so thrilled I found this place! If you're a fan of ramen or udon noodles, look no further! They offer various styles of broth and different choices of meats: chicken, beef, shrimp, tofu... and choose either traditional or some other style which I forget. 
The bowls are HUGE!! I split it with my kiddo and still have leftovers.
I think I will come here this weekend!
In other news, they have a boba tea housed in the same restaurant/spot. So walk a few steps and you can get smoothies and snow."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of this place because it's just about the only place to get ramen in the valley, and their ramen is pretty tasty. But the last time I went there I ordered my standard republic broth with tofu, add hard boiled egg, and extra noodle, but also got a side of food poisoning. I know it was this place because other than here I had only had a small breakfast of toast and laughing cow cheese at home (which I eat every morning) that day. The following morning I woke up with all the symptoms of food poisoning, I still give them 3 stars because I have been eating here for years. I don't know what changed but I won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Good stuff. No complaints. Food was hot and tasty. Good place if you are around campus and want som Ramen."}
{"text":"I came back here after learning of my allergy to gluten and they have zero menu items that are gluten free. ZERO GLUTEN FREE OPTIONS. Not one. So, while I enjoyed the ramen I had months ago, I am not able to eat one single thing there now. So disappointed."}
{"text":"Unbelievably yummy and inexpensive. Very healthy and flavorful. Staff is super friendly and fast!"}
{"text":"I love this place & bring so many friends here. 
I always get the curry bowl because I'm gluten intolerant. There's so many flavors! The potatoes are a great touch.  
My friends normally get the Republic Ramen and love it. 
Wait time here can be a bit tricky - they probably should have at least 1 or 2 more workers during every busy time here"}
{"text":"I love this place ! It's a regular stop when I'm in that part of town. A solid selection of ramen bowls that has something to offer for everyone. I usually start with some edamame and shrimp or vegy tempura. The wife and kids like it before we head over to the climbing walls next door. Nothing fancy, just good."}
{"text":"Don't come here if you had real Ramen before. And if you're asian, definitely don' try lol Instant Korean ramen noodles broth is better than this. I feel like this place is operated by non-asian people who don't put soul in the ramen. 
Quick lunch? Sure why not. 
Wanna enjoy ramen? There are places in town that do better than this. 
Sorry that I have to leave 1 star review."}
{"text":"Love this place! Love the chicken miso ramen. Always my fav when I am there. My husband comes at least once a week to eat the same dish as mine!

They have friendly employees and good costumer service; there always with a smile. They have open seating when eating in which is good to not feel cluttered. 

Easy parking for the most park even when it's busy during lunch time and easy to find this place."}
{"text":"Too bland no flavor. They need to work on there soup base, because thats what makes the ramen. Just too bland, and I ordered the miso ramen, which tasted like water and shoyu. First and last time coming here."}
{"text":"I don't know if this place is Ramen restaurant or Pho restaurant...  The broth was too watered down and way too much broth like Pho.  I guess theiir focus is quick eats and go.  
The restraurant is dirty.  While eating, I was so worried about all the dust falling into my food from the ceiling and the ceiling fans. The dust is so visible, I don't think they cleaned it from the start of the restaurant.  Their kitchen and bathroom looks dirty as well.  I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"Had my first experience here over the weekend and I really enjoyed it! I've only been to a couple other ramen places, but this one was different than those because you order at the counter. I got the vegetarian ramen with rice noodles, tofu, and original veggies. It was good! The veggies were super fresh, portions were massive for the price. My only complaint was that is was really salty. But not like so salty I couldn't eat it or anything. It was yummy! Also the place was clean and the staff was nice. I'd be happy to come back and maybe get some boba too next time!"}
{"text":"OK so let me start off by saying this place is called Republic RAMEN+NOODLES. Their soups are out of this world, I have yet to have every single one, but coming close. They are good for what they are known for their FOOD. Me and my boyfriend keep on going back because they are so good.

Now Milk Teas: The place is not called anything close to resembling milk teas. They are not the best that I have tasted, but that's not why I'm going there for. I'm there for the FOOD :)"}
{"text":"I would give less stars if I could. Came here several times and seemed okay, but in the last two trips I have found hair and a sharp piece of metal (I was told was from a cleaning bristle - yuck!) in my ramen. Totally grossed out and terrified of how much it would hurt to ingest metal like that. Never returning and advise that they are seriously looked into by the health department. Even more aggravating, the lady just said \"sorry guys\" to the last problem with our order - no refund. Horrible place."}
{"text":"The portions are okay.  I didn't think the gyoza were great.  tasted a bit freezer burned (dry) and they looked deep fried which was weird.  Lots of people come in, a testament to their popularity.  A good mix of locals, college students, hipsters and whatnot all congregate to get a bowl of steaming noodles.  The ramen is what you want, the udon and soba are only okay.  (i.e. you can make those items yourselves).  They come pretty plain and you pay for additional toppings and accoutraments.  The tempura is good, just greasy enough but only comes with a meager three pieces.  the service is spotty, the hostess/receptionist has a tendency to mix up orders, having her read back your order is a must.  Its not the super cheap meal that you would expect for ramen, but it is pretty tasty.  the place is trendy, bright with piped in techno style music.  I didn't feel like I was in the middle of tempe despite having just stepped in from the stripmall location in the nondescript side of Tempe."}
{"text":"Strangely confused.. I went excited and with high anticipation and hunger... I ended up in a crackheads bathroom and a 20 min wait.   The good... Chill vibe and atmosphere.. the clientele seems used to the long wait 7 people in line and dim lighting. The bad... 7 people in line.. Lighting as if I'm getting my freak on.. And I waited about 10 mins to place my order as nobody was at the register ! After placing my order I went to the bathroom to my dismay, there was trash all over the floor.. A dirty bathroom with a sponge laying next to the toilet and smeared mirrors. I felt the walls sinking in so I escaped only to find the kitchen with food all over the floor and dirty dishes everywhere. My food was med warm (to go)/@!$   and very dry meat. Broth was flavorless and noodles seemed old. There was a hint of vegetables in the broth . I will never go again ."}
{"text":"Came here after a rock climbing at the Phoenix rock gym, For lunch. 
Menu consists of different varieties of broth. They also have a vegetarian broth Ramen.

Today, I got the chili pepper broth with the original toppings and pork.
So the broth is not too oily, it doesn't have the greasy feeling after you drink it. However, the broth wasn't as spicy as I would have liked it. The broth feels like it was one of their other regular broth with some of the green chili pepper minced up for you to mix it in.

The port was thinly slice had a little bit of fat, but overall was cooked well. However it was lacking flavor. It felt more like it was maybe just sliced in boil without any seasoning. Not like the regular pork bellies at other ramen places.

The original toppings consisted of spinach, bean sprouts, carrots, and some other misc.

The ramen noodle was average, not exceptional or anything. But there was a good amount of the ramen in the bowl.

Overall in the entire dish out of a 10 scale rating system is maybe a 6.5.

Would I eat here again? Maybe, but I will try a different type of broth Base.

But would I come here just to eat this, probably not. 

Will continue to search for the best ramen in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Kind of a divey college noodle house.  You get a S-Load of food for cheap.  Food is good.  If you are on a budget and hungry, this is a great place to get acquainted with REAL ramen - not that crap you get in the grocery store.  This is a whole-nuther-level."}
{"text":"I am from Chicago and we have some of the best ramen, so when I recently came back I was craving it like no other! I googled and this was the first place to show up! Its actually not that bad!!! I do prefer a little more savory and spicy and for it to cater to vegetarians more, but for the money--its not bad!! As a bonus, it has boba--which PLEASE, get more options like green tea--and the atmosphere is so rad! Cannot wait to come back again!!"}
{"text":"Wasn't for me.
Vegetarian broth and tofu- bland, even with added sauces. Food came out very slowly. Honeydew snow boba- not blended enough, very icy, took what felt like 20 minutes to come out, but good flavor and boba. Service- good not great and unenthusiastic. Atmosphere was nice, though. I wanted to like this place so much but just didn't."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot, they have tons of ramen options and every type I've tried is good! If you like Japanese fare, this place delivers. It's an order at the counter and then the food is brought to your table establishment. I knocked off a star for restaurant arrangement and organization, but overall you're there for the food and it doesn't disappoint"}
{"text":"Republic Ramen is an affordable and delicious ramen house in Tempe. I don't eat here frequently in the summer because it's 1,000 degrees outside and who wants soup when it's so hot?! But, it's a great meal on a cold day, and if it's raining you'll probably catch me here, slurping down a giant bowl of noodles.

The portions are huge so expect to take leftovers home. I always order my ramen \"traditional style,\" meaning the noodles are topped with bamboo shoots, seaweed, naruto (slices of fermented fish - they are white with a pink spiral - TRY THEM!), and scallions. You get your choice of meat, but I always go with tofu because the quality of their chicken isn't very good. I haven't tried the other meats because the tofu is a good fit with all of those traditional toppings. (Honestly, I'm apprehensive to try any other meats after having their chicken a few times. Why bother with the potential of being disappointed when the tofu is delicious?) 

Republic Ramen also offers Udon noodle bowls and a few rice plates, but you really can't go wrong with the traditional ramen bowls. I've ordered shrimp tempura and edamame as a side, both of which are a nice supplement to the soup if you're craving something more than broth and noodles. They have a wide variety of boba teas, regular tea, and \"slush\" drinks. They also sell beer and sake but I've never ordered anything alcoholic. 

The ambiance of the restaurant is good. Nothing fancy but it certainly isn't a hole in the wall. Sound is average, depending on how many other people are eating there. They've got some super cute Asian art on the walls and it always makes me smile. Lots of seating indoors and outside, so even if it's busy you aren't super close to anyone else. Depending where you sit and how curious you are, you can peek inside the kitchen to see large pots of broth on the stove and the chefs hard at work.

Great value, very rich flavors, and good quality food (minus the meat, like I said...). The service is nothing special, but it certainly isn't terrible. I've never had to wait any longer than 10 minutes to get my food. All of the employees are helpful and friendly, but it isn't a restaurant where you get waited on. My only complaint regarding service is I've seen an employee's son behind the counter before. I understand if you can't afford childcare, but keep him in the back! You don't want me to think that you employ 6-year-old children, right...?"}
{"text":"Republic Ramen has been my go-to for the last year. Whenever I want to go out to dinner with my friends we always choose Republic Ramen. The food is delish and affordable. We always split our bowls to save money. Even splitting the bowls there is so much food. I would also recommend the curry rice, it is one of my favorite dishes there! The only issue is it always seems like they never make enough of it."}
{"text":"The ramen here is absolutely horrible. I still come here because of 2 things. My friends like it here and it's really the only ramen place in the Tempe.

Bottom line, this place is for people that had never experienced excellent ramen other than the package ramen at the store. This place just puts a lot of sodium in your broth and then gives you hot sauce too to cover up the bland taste. 

I have eaten ramen in Japan and California, and this place can't compare. But if YOU have never eaten authentic ramen bowls in Asia or California, then YOU may like this ramen. Oh... this place isn't even run by anyone that is Japanese. Contrary to what their shirts say, THEY DON\"T KNOW RAMEN.

And the prices at actually kind of high for it's mediocre quality. If you are in AZ and want some authentic ramen, try Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe. They are not a ramen restaurant but they do serve a couple of different ramen bowls. You'll notice the drastic difference."}
{"text":"I have had Ramen in San Francisco and this is not even close.  Cubed chicken hmmmm did we go to Costco or Sams for it?  A 4 star rating for this place is not right.  Obviously you haven't had REAL ramen.  Not bad but don't be fooled by the ratings.  They are NOT accurate."}
{"text":"Made the trek from Glendale to Tempe to try this place with friends after seeing the booth at Phoenix Comic Con. This just cemented my feeling that all of the cool and interesting restaurants are in the East Valley.

I ordered the tunkatsu ramen (sorry about the spelling) with beef and hubby ordered the spicy ramen with beef. I liked that there were lots of choices for broths and two different options for vegetables. The bowls of soup were HUGE- everyone ended up with enough left over for another meal. The broths were rich and salty, and definitely tasted like they had been simmered all day. The veggies were abundant and fresh and I felt like there were plenty of noodles although our friend disagreed. I would really have preferred that they cut up the pork in my soup- it was literally in large slices and was awkward to eat. Our friend had his soup with chicken and said it was diced, which makes much more sense. 

Friends ordered the shrimp tempura and were pretty disappointed to find out that for $4 they got three pieces of shrimp and one onion ring, especially since the soups were so generous. They did say it tasted good, but that's still a pretty skimpy tempura for $4.

Prices were fair for the amount of food, at least for the soups. I wouldn't order the tempura again at that price. Part of me wants to say that since ramen is supposed to be cheap street food they could cut the price of everything by a dollar or so but then again, we all took home enough for another meal.

Oh, and although you order your food and pay at the counter, they bring it to you at your table and clear plates when you are finished. We tipped thinking that the restaurant wasn't full service and then felt bad afterwards. There is a cash tip jar at the counter if you make the same mistake though."}
{"text":"We moved to Texas and all I do is dream about this soup. It's perfect and their slushees are delicious."}
{"text":"I've been here once and thought it was so-so. I'm not sure how often I would be running back to eat here but I did leave with leftovers because this place gives you an ENORMOUS bowl of food! I also tried the thai boba tea, which I didn't love. If I'm in the area, I'd much rather check out four peaks (which is a block away) rather than this place, just sayin."}
{"text":"Ordered the republic ramen with tofu and it tasted bland.  My husband got the republic ramen with spam and it tasted much better than mine.  His had a nice sweet flavor, which is what I would recommend."}
{"text":"In an ocean of soup I only found 4 noodles in my order. I complained and an employee and she asked for my order number and then disappeared. I could not believe it. I will not be returning again."}
{"text":"We love love love this place. it's so comforting and yummy AND they have Boba! (when they haven't run out) Id recommend sitting down rather than taking to go just because I think a to-go bowl is smaller than the regular bowl giving you a little less food. but it is so yummy! I get the miso broth."}
{"text":"I give it a two for the broth alone and noodles.  The place was DIRTY. Dirty dishes on every table. I ordered beef. It came with literally cold slices of deli meat, roast beef. Not a traditional Ramen.  Would not go back."}
{"text":"Arizona? Japanese food? Ramen? 

Ramen in...Arizona?

That is correct, boys and girls, ramen exists in Tempe, Arizona.

And it's actually not to far from the likes of the famous ramen joints in CA. I had a taste of the tonkatsu and miso ramen, and they were both pretty flavorful, with an O-kay broth. The noodles, like Angela Y. says, aren't too amazing. They're hard and the consistency is too instant-rameny for my liking. I had the curry and let me just say... the portions are humongous! Split 50/50 between curry (potatos, curry sauce, and carrots) and white rice, this thing will fill you up like no other. However, the curry's nothing more than the stuff you can make out of instant packets and microwavable meals. 

The restaurant is large and accommodated our group of 30+ people very well. Service was spot on, though the register took some time due to credit card processing waits. Our servers brought our bowls out consistently and quickly, and everything came out freshly cooked. 

GOOD: Portions, price, service
Not too great: Ramen noodles"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is nice,
But service was really slow.
Food was not that great.

Servings were too small,
Though the bowls were sizeable.
Add-ons, expensive.

I got the curry.
It had lots and lots of rice
Sadly, little else.

Noodles looked okay.
But not too interested
In a second trip."}
{"text":"I've gone twice - the weekend they opened and then the next weekend. I had to stop myself from going a third time because I could sense a snowball effect happening (both the fear I might start living there and the fear of becoming rounder and rounder in the mid section). 

Went to Japan last year and fell in love with kyushu/hakata ramen. Cherryblossom Noodle Cafe's is closer to what I had in Tokyo (though only half as good), but this was still very good. Got the Republic ramen which came as a nice big helping, piping hot. The noodles were done perfectly - not overdone. The pork the first time was super! I could taste the ginger and the pieces were large and lean. The second time I was disappointed in the pork - it was a smaller portion, fattier, and less taste. I did fear they pulled out the big guns for opening weekend and won't be the same from then on. Guess I'll have to go a third time to get a good average. 

I agree with others on here - skip the gyoza. I'm a huge fan of gyoza when done right, but these were greasy and thick with no dipping sauce if I'm remembering correctly. 

Oh - and yes, the look is modern but the benches have a bit of an unfinished edge. I thought I was going to get a splinter. Look out for this or opt for the high top seating."}
{"text":"salty. pricy. the soup in my donkotsu ramen tasted like salt water and the rice for my friend's chicken curry was way overcooked the rice lost its shape literally and watery. i'm sorry but it was straight up gross. donkotsu meat too hard and overcooked. salty overall. plus, take the carrots out of the soup please!"}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks ago on a whim

Food: I got the Miso ramen. While the food looked aesthetically pleasing and the portions were generous, the ramen broth was lacking. The broth was watery and not rich or full bodied like miso should be. The flavors of the broth and the ramen + toppings just didn't tie together--I could tell there was something missing. 

Atmosphere: Very lovely with lots of seating. I have to mention though that half way through our meal I realized my leggings were reallyyy stuck in something sticky on the bench I was sitting on. I laid 2 napkins on top of it and when I tried to take them off later, I couldn't! I literally tried to scrape the napkins off and they wouldn't budge! I let the staff know and apologized, and they as well, but...yeah, I had to pick mystery sticky junk off my leggings when we got home. 

Service: Good. Food came out quick, as I would assume ramen to normally be, and the staff were nice and funny and recommended things they liked. They were, however, having a rubber band gun fight with each other right in front of us while we were trying to make our decisions.  

Price: Overpriced for the quality.

Bottom line--I won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"Coming from O.C./ Irvine area, I've been craving good beef noodle. Looked this place up and saw the great reviews, I thought I had to try it! 

To my disappointment it was nothing like I had expected. I mean the food wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything really.... I asked for super spciy... and it wasn't really spicy at all... it was really just kind of plain.

A lot of broth, not enough noodles... that's all I have left to say about this place."}
{"text":"If you wish your soup tasted more like the Pacific Ocean then this place is for you. More sweat tasting liquid than you've ever hoped for."}
{"text":"Secretly I have been wanting to try Republic Ramen for many months, but the fact that I am not a soup person keep me from it, but after a little adventure with Ramen not too long ago, it left me craving for some more! So I thought what a perfect time to try Republic Ramen & Noodles, and I made my way there.

It was around 4:45 on a cool wed evening the place wasn't too busy, what I didn't realize was this was sort of a fast food type of place, as soon as you walk in you see the menu to order off of. After checking it out, I went with Chili Pepper Ramen, soy sauce based infused with Thai Chili pepper, bell pepper & roasted garlic and it comes with spinach, sprouts, scallions, carrots & your choice of pork, tofu, spam, chicken or beef. I went with beef, I placed my order then took my seat to wait for it! You can add other items to your ramen at a low price, but since this was my 1st time I just went with the items already included 

The soup came out, and I have to say it smelt soo good, and the flavor of the broth was good, but not spicy enough for me, but I added some sriracha and we were in business! I like that they use locally grown veggies and you can tell they are fresh, the spinach was perfect! Next time I will add more veggies to my ramen. The only thing that I didn't care for in the ramen was the beef itself, it was a thick slices of beef that was tough, like a tough roast, I didn't care for it, maybe next time I will just skip adding any type of meat at all, if I go back but it's a big bowl of ramen, and the broth was delish"}
{"text":"I thought this was a legit ramen place but it's actually a fast food like place. Which was really disappointing because I was hoping to get some authentic ramen. It really feels like a bowl of instant noodles that I could have made at home for less than 3 dollars. However, I have to commend that the portion is pretty huge. So two star for the food but I liked their customer service, portion, etc so I'm giving them a 3 stars."}
{"text":"Republic Ramen + Noodle gave me hope.  Why?  Well, when I left the SF Bay area a while back, the thing I dreaded leaving most was all the amazing privately-owned restaurants and hidden ma-n-pa joints that serve up delicious, authentic food.  Republic Ramen soothed my fear a lil though, since they dish out a pretty tasty bowl of ramen.  In fact, their Shoya ramen is just as good as my regular order back in Cali - butter corn ramen.  (I did have to add corn to it though and would love to see a butter corn option on the Republic menu one day.)    

The restaurant is clean, freshly decorated and service was efficient (order and pay at front counter, they bring your food).  Those facts, combined with the fact that the ramen was so good (and they have kimchi sides), give Republic 5 stars!

See ya there!"}
{"text":"4/5 times they have great food but sometimes the soup will be super watery and the noodles will be over cooked.  Most of the time tho they have great food.  Love their miso ramen with rice noodles!"}
{"text":"If you're a fan of Pho, do not come here. Food is weird and definitely overpriced for the amount of meat/tofu that comes in a bowl. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Delicious ramen and udon with high customizable options for whatever you're feeling. Spacious and hip/casual atmosphere with $5 large kirin bottles during happy hour. Perfect for meat lovers and vegetarians alike. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"I checked in earlier, now i jus wanna give my review about this place. My buddy and I were the first ones here, they just opened at 11a. Guy at the counter explained to us about the ramen base soup. I got the spicy with original toppings, you can get traditional which includes bamboo shoots. I even had the squid salad for $4, not bad, it was quite actually full of flavor. The ramen soup was quite pretty good too, will come back again!"}
{"text":"I finally had a chance to come to place again with my cousin. Everyone I know thinks this place is not all that great, but I have a difference in opinion. Let's see, I always end up ordering the chili pepper ramen with beef and egg. Can't go wrong. I think the ingredients they use are fresh and tasty. The broth is really good with a little dose of their special spicy powder they have. Customer service was good and it just has a chill, laid back vibe to it in which I can't complain about."}
{"text":"Republic Ramen (or as I tend to say - Ramen Republic) is a great little place if you're looking for a huge serving of fantastic food for decently cheap. The staff is very friendly, and your food is prepared to exactly how you want. They've got a pretty great variety of soups and add ins, and lots of neat drinks too. I frequently come here with a large group of my friends, and they're always happy to serve us, which is a nice change of pace from restaurants that groan at large groups. 
Overall, great little place with a fun, relaxed atmosphere. A definite visit is needed if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I tried Republic Ramen out for the first time this week. Experience was okay.

I ordered the vegetable tempura and miso ramen with tofu. The staff were all very friendly and restaurant was clean. No complaints there. I was a little disappointed when I got home and saw the vegetable tempura only contained 3 pieces. For $4.50 it was definitely not worth it. 
The ramen was good. I haven't tried many places but I really liked the broth. They separate out the noodles and broth when you get it to-go, which I liked a lot. (Great for leftovers!) They give you huge portions with the ramen but my complaint here was that they don't give you a lot of tofu (or protein). Overall, I would come back but be open to trying new dishes."}
{"text":"This review is specifically for the vegetarian ramen. As another reviewer noted, the broth is EXTREMELY salty. Like it literally looks and tastes like it's 90% soy sauce (I couldn't taste anything else). But the portions are huge for the price so I guess there's that? :/ Maybe the non-veg ramen is better here?

(I would say head down University a few more blocks to Umami if you want vegetarian ramen, but the last 4 times I've tried to go they were \"out\" of their veg broth so I'm starting to wonder if they ever make it anymore.)"}
{"text":"Sooo I had been wanting to try this place for awhile and I wasn't impressed as much as everyone says in their reviews. I had the republic and although spicy which I love the broth itself was bland. They do give you a huge amount for the price the pork gyoza was good wish they could have steamed them or offered that instead of frying. The restaurant itself was clean employees were nice but they need to work on their broth ."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday night with a group of friends. Ordered the tonkatsu ramen with tradition toppings, pork, and an egg. The broth was decent. Toppings was what I expected. The pork was definitely not what I expected. Not charshui style. It tasted very bland. Definitely had better coming from CA, but the broth was good, good portion size, and service was very fast. Price was alright also. Craving ramen in AZ, this is the place to go. Haven't found any place better."}
{"text":"Ordered the chili ramen with egg. The egg was way overcomes and lacked in flavor. The pork was plain had no texture, like they just boiled the pork. The firmness of the ramen was ok but nothing special"}
{"text":"The food is alright, not inedible, but not authentic either. If you're a little otaku nerd, you'll probably love this place and think it's the real shiz though. Pricey for what you get (vegetable tempura, $4? Really?)  The decor is cool, and the staff is pretty chill. The friendly staff is just about the only thing that has led me to go there more than once. I'll stick to the instant ramen before I order another bowl here though."}
{"text":"Ok, personally this was a one time deal for me. The ramen was ok, charsiu was pretty sad, and the curry rice was mostly rice, with a bit of curry on top. It was also topped with some shredded carrots, which in my opinion does not go so well with the already cooked carrots in the curry.

I also ordered sake, which I did not get until after the food.

For people that may not have much exposure to great authentic ramen, this may not be a bad place to try out. However, if you're looking for the real deal you may want to pass on this one."}
{"text":"Got sick after eating their chili ramen, which wasn't even spicy. I would have given more stars if it had been delicious before sickness, but not the case. Also, where's the tofu? Skimp protein portion."}
{"text":"I used to live in So Cal & Vegas, so all Asian food gets compared to those areas.  As much as I wanted to love this place, it only gets 3 Stars. 

The portions here are pretty big and the flavors are unique.

Their idea of \"spicy\" is really mild though....so for spice lovers, you'll have to supplement it with Sriracha.

It's not like a legit, Ramen place you'll find in other cities....but it will suffice until I travel somewhere I can get the real thing.

{"text":"The food was really good. It was cheap. It had a nice atmosphere. I would totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"Fantastic curry rice and super ample portions.   Awesome staff that made a great experience for me.  I will be back again and wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who loves Japanese cuisine or simply great food! !!"}
{"text":"We passed this place years ago and have been saying we've wanted to try it for so long but being so far away from us it has been difficult. But after getting a coupon at Phoenix Comic Con we bit the bullet and made the drive.

I have been wanting to try authentic Ramen for a very long time. And I will say the food was impressive, it tasted great, although I wish it were a little heavier on the noodles. 

What I wasn't impressed with though was the price. A bowl of Ramen in Japan is like getting a hotdog from a street vendor in New York, it is supposed to be quick and inexpensive, and while I understand that it is a niche kind of dish here, I don't think $10+ for a bowl of soup and a drink is a very good value. We ordered an appetizer of Tempura shrimp too, $4 gets you three shrimp and a single onion ring. That actually kind of pissed me off.

The staff was friendly and the service was good and quick. I am happy for the experience, but I probably won't be back anytime soon unless I'm with someone that is really jonesing for some real-deal Ramen."}
{"text":"I give 2 stars for cleanliness and service of the establishment but no stars for food. I was expecting too much when I drove by and saw the ramen sign. I was hopeful this would be almost as good as the Ramen houses in California such as Santouka ramen but no dice. I ordered the Shio (salt) ramen with traditional toppings. It was too salty, they took the name literally. Shio broth is suppose to be very rich, flavorful and fatty that is so delicious, you can't stop slurping. Their Shio was too salty with no flavor. Tasted like over salted Chinese won ton soup broth with no richness. The ramen noodles and the toppings were okay. Sliced pork was tender. If you're not expecting traditional authentic ramen house flavor, then this might be worth trying. Maybe their other broths are outstanding but I'm not willing to try again. I should have trusted my gut feeling that a ramen house shouldn't be serving, coffee and boba. Ramen house that uses Chinese restaurant chopstick wrappers should be a good clue that this isn't authentic. No Japanese or asian cooks here either."}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I have been looking for a good ramen place and let me tell you, we FINALLY found one! This place is so amazing. The ramen is so thick and so good, the soup is delicious, and the ingredients are amazing. I usually get the miso ramen bc it's so good and simple for maybe starters."}
{"text":"This isn't your cheap pack of ramen you get at the store for 25 cents. So If your looking for a traditional ramen then look no farther! Go visit RR+N and get ready to feast. 

Tip: The portion size is roughly the size of two packs of ramen if not more."}
{"text":"This place is really good for a bowl of ramen. Their serving is large too, I always have leftovers whenever I'm done. Their boba is really good too (tapioca always taste fresh and chewy). I always order their original ramen and a side of shrimp and veggie tempura. Their tempura is really good here. Although their price might be a lil high, it's good food and plenty as well. I'll come again and again!"}
{"text":"This place satisfies my Ramen craving, except the broth is extremely salty in my opinion. The salt seems to settle towards the bottom. I've had Ramen at many different places before and understand that in general, Ramen is heavier on the salty side. But even my Japanese boyfriend agrees it is too salty. I like to finish all the broth because it's tasty but I can't here. Upside is that they give you a lot of broth. 

Ingredients are good, both traditional and what I call \"American\" option, Boba is flavorful, I love that they offer beer. But I don't order the beer because the broth is dehydrating as it is."}
{"text":"I've tried this place several times hoping it would get better. I order the vegetarian soup and it so unbelievably bland that I always end up pouring a whole bottle of hot sauce in it just so I can get it down. It tastes like hospital broth that you get after a major surgery.

Also, the place is always dirty when I go in there. 

Won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! I walked in expecting to see stereotype Asian decor but I was blown away! It's modernized decor fit the food perfectly, they have free WiFi and these cool long tables and tall chairs that at first the tables just look long for decoration, but then I realized it has another use: catches your flicks of soup so it doesn't land on another person (LOL)!

Okay, I'm getting ahead of myself here; ordering was a bit intimidating, since it was my first time here. My friend was with me and walked me through it, it was a breeze! The guy who took our orders was nice and chatty, we sat, and our food came out fast - I was pretty impressed with the setup, really nice, modernized, and delicious.

The ramen is flavorful, the bean sprout crunchy, the carrots crunchy, the spinach delicious, and the noodles are al dente and then when they sit in the bowl at the bottom, it soaks up the broth and the flavors of whatever else you ordered as another topping! My mouth is watering just thinking about it!"}
{"text":"Second visit the veggie broth seemed much more salty and there was a minor mess up with the order. Upon closer inspection there is a bit of an unclean feel to the place. Still good and a great value."}
{"text":"I love the ramen here. Warning: you will leave here smelling like oil. Don't wear anything here you need to wear all day. You'll regret it."}
{"text":"it makes me sad that pho is such a huge deal in az while there's barely any ramen shops at all. don't get me wrong-pho is awesome, but i LOVE ramen. so what's the deal, arizona? let's get some more ramen shops going! 

so that brings me to republic. if you've had ramen in japan and constantly crave it like i do, don't come here expecting any of that deliciousness-you will be sorely disappointed.  republic's ramen is totally mediocre, yet i keep coming back because it's the closest thing that i can get.  sad. 

it doesn't really matter what you order, all of the soups taste practically identical so i'd recommend going with the chili pepper ramen-it at least gives the super bland broth some zip. 

other than that, the place is cute, the employees are friendly, and they do have a good selection of drinks/boba."}
{"text":"I ordered a soy based ramen and my husband ordered a miso based ramen. Both didn't pack a punch and my husbands wasn't salty at all, very disappointed. The corn was still cold in my ramen. We both really didn't enjoy the food. Being from the Bay Area CA, their is no comparison. We are going to try more places. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Recently visited here. Neither of the people at the counter seemed very knowledgeable, I wasn't expecting a history lesson in ramen, but at the very least tell me a little more than \"pork broth\" when I ask what's in a soup, or some idea of what Boba is.
Previously, the only ramen restaurant I had ever visited was The Ramen House in Sacramento, California- and that place was DIVINE. Their ramen was beyond perfection, so my standards were high.

This place did not meet my expectations. The bench seats were wood, and very high up to the table. Was not comfortable. I ordered the tonkotsu ramen, pork. The pork was dried out, and I realised when I got my soup that it did not come with a soy egg. That's actually extra, I was shocked to find out. The bowl portion however was huge and the noodles perfectly made. The broth was delicious, not too salty. 

I would come back here,  only because I don't know of any other ramen places near Chandler that I could try. Overall it wasn't terrible but definitely not great."}
{"text":"Horrid. I'm vegetarian and ordered the veggie ramen. Was served fish cakes in my bowl. Asked for it to be removed and a fresh bowl. All they did was remove the fish cake. Broth and tofu tasted burned. Extremely bad aftertaste too. Asked for a refund. Paid by card and was given cash because the manager wasn't there. Interesting because it's a simple refund!!!"}
{"text":"I was seriously craving ramen so I found this place on Yelp and drove here after school. (Why aren't there any ramen places here?) I ordered the Republic Ramen and the food came out pretty quickly. It was around $8-9.
The place is cute, it was clean and bigger than I expected.

As soon as I tasted the broth, only one word popped up in my mind: bland. So I got up and got a bunch of sriracha, chili oil, and the chili pepper and poured them in, as I have done before with bland ramen. 

It wasn't as bad as some that I have tried, but definitely not as good as ramen you'd get in LA. I liked the spinach (I love spinach), but I wish they put more sprouts. The beef was not that great, it was kind of tough. The soup needed way more flavor and waay more spiciness. I got the Republic Ramen cause I thought it'd be kind of spicy (it says it has spicy exotic peppers in the description). The bowl was huge though and I couldn't finish it by myself, next time I'll make sure to share with a friend. Because I was starving and ramen was the only thing I was going to eat that day, I ate quite a bit of it. But if it was a normal day and I was in a normal mood, I honestly probably would have boxed it and given it to my brother or something lol.

I've honestly made better ramen at home (not the typical stuff in a bag, but decent ramen). Thankfully it's fall break and I can run to LA to get my ramen fix."}
{"text":"I visited with my brother and sister either in April or May. The ramen was great as usual, however, my brother's and sister's honeydew milk tea and black milk tea were as bland and flavorless as my taro milk tea I mentioned on my previous review."}
{"text":"About the only thing I can say about it is it's ramen. Got the chili pepper ramer, which adds a glop of Thai chili paste to their soy based broth. The chicken was quite bland, and diced very small which made picking up pieces with the chopsticks quite impossible. The result leaves you with spoonfuls of bland chicken in the end, not the best ending at all to a meh meal. I suppose peddling this to college students, who haven't developed keen taste buds yet but have the disposable cash to not have to suffice on a traditional student based ramen diet, this place works. The staff was friendly and the meals were delivered quickly, even for a well packed house and close to closing time."}
{"text":"There are few other shops in the area with better service and ramen, but I will say there boba tea is pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Unfortunately we came on a busy night with a 20 person party and had to wait 45 minutes. Also our tempura came out cold. This is the first time I've had this problem at this place, they really need to up their game on their side dishes."}
{"text":"Love the soup here, when I have a craving for Ramen I always come to this place and the boba tea is soooo good!"}
{"text":"I like the decor, the boba was alright, the ramen was pretty good and abundant in its serving. However, the service isn't that great, the staff's personalities is anything but outgoing, and the tables and floors are always sticky."}
{"text":"Man, if you live on campus and havent been to this place yet you are missing out. Very reasonable prices, especially considering how much you get for them.

I oredered the Shoyu ramen (traditional) for takeout. The actual restaurant looks very modern. Very clean, large, good for groups. The service was fast, and the staff was great. I got my food and was on my way. Unfortunately, there was some kind of leak in the container that my broth was in so it leaked all over my seat in my car. And when I got home and picked up the bag, the entire bottom fell out and there went my broth- everywhere. I was so sad! Until I took a chance and called Republic. I explained to them what happened and they had more broth ready for me when I got there, free of charge. So awesome.

As for the actual food, I wasnt so much a fan of the traditional ingredients. The broth and actual ramen were very good though.

Ill definitly be back, but Ill be ordering the \"Original\" ingredients."}
{"text":"My family and I have eaten here twice, now--I have to say, I have enjoyed it! There were a couple annoying little quirks, but the overall experiences were good.

The food is fabulous! They are very vegetarian-friendly. However, sometimes the staff you order from don't understand the concept of vegetarianism. We ordered our dishes with vegetable broth and specifically asked for no fish or fish sauce, yet when my dad ordered the kimchi appetizer they failed to tell us that it's soaked in fish oil. That's happened a couple of times--now we just make sure to ask about EVERYTHING. The portions are HUGE! Which is a plus for me (lunch for the next day is ALWAYS a plus).

The service can be good and can be bad, as previously mentioned. Some are very nice, but some just don't seem to \"get it\" (especially with the vegetarian thing).

The tables have a tendencies to be sticky or messy--I don't think they're cleaned too often between customers.

The water cups are TINY. That gets a little inconvenient. I started asking for two.

The atmosphere is nice, but a little loud on the music. We always eat in the back corner because it's quieter. It's always busy.

Anyway, overall I like this place and would like to keep returning! It has a few details that are rough-around-the-edges, but nothing that can't be worked around!"}
{"text":"We went with high expectations, but were disappointed in the flavor of the vegetarian bowl. The meal was presented nicely and the food looked fresh, but the broth had zero flavor even with the added garlic paste. The noodles were cooked properly as well, but flavor is critical."}
{"text":"This place was good. The Republic Ramen dish was good and spicy. Straight to the point menu. Everyone said the Boba is good but I didn't get a chance to try it.  The smell in there kind of put me off but my Husband didn't think anything of it.  If you look close at things inside...things look really thrown together. Lots of cover ups and patches on the walls. I suppose that doesn't affect the food.  Id go back... the noodles were awesome..."}
{"text":"Finally I tried their noodle soups, and the taste of broth is good, the amount of noodles overwhelming and more veggies than a pho. HOWEVER, I was able to count the pieces of meat...TWO! 

No wonder why students go here, I guess they don't realize the difference. The boba thing...It seems that first time I was just lucky!."}
{"text":"If you're like me, when you hear the word ramen you think about the packages of dried noodles with the flavor pack that you get at the grocery store five for a dollar. So walking into a restaurant that specializes in ramen, I didn't really know what to expect.

Luckily, the guy working behind the counter was nice enough to walk me through the various ramen options so I knew just what I was getting myself into.

This ramen is like the store bought stuff on steroids. First of all - they give you a ton! I couldn't even get through half of it. Secondly, it includes something the store stuff lacks - fresh ingredients. Mixed in with the noodles was spinach, carrots and I chose pork as my meat. The broth was flavorful and the noodles has a nice flavor and consistency. I would have liked more pork though. The meat to noodle ratio was a bit unbalanced.

I think this place is a good alternative to other asian restaurants and would make a great option for a quick and filling lunch."}
{"text":"Food is fine but I saw not one, but two roaches during lunch.  Told the counter and they didn't seem terribly surprised."}
{"text":"Pros:
Portion was decent
Not loud (at least during the time we went)
Fairly clean facilities
Nothing wrong w/service or employees that we could see

Cons:
Ridiculously salty, cannot emphasize this enough. If they would just tone the salt down, we would have come back after the only visit we had.

It's turning out to be nearly impossible to find a consistently great ramen in Tempe, which is discouraging. Maybe we'll try Republic again and give it a chance, hopefully we won't experience the overload of salt again."}
{"text":"Republic Ramen looks and sounds like a promising restaurant; unfortunately, my first bite told me otherwise.  While the food is not inedible, it definitely does NOT resemble traditional Japanese ramen.  I ordered an original milk tea boba & a bowl of tonkotsu ramen with pork.  The pork is nothing like the pork that comes with authentic ramen.  Instead, it was pale, tough, and flavorless.  The noodles and soup are fine but way less flavorful than I am used to from a restaurant advertising themselves as a ramen restaurant and not just a plain noodle house.  And the boba I ordered was VERY flavorless and watered down.  However, on the bright side, the boba pearls were the perfect texture and level of chewiness!"}
{"text":"A great place to eat. Great portions especially for the pricing. A wide variety of options to pick from and al have really complex and amazing flavors. I would give it a 5 out of 5 but I unfortunately got my food lukewarm and was disappointed to have received it that way. Overall though I would visit again and try one of their many different varieties of ramen and other things they have (such as the snow items they advertise.)"}
{"text":"Yeah... No! This place is seriously horrible. The whole set up is strange and the ramen is even stranger. I would rate this as the worst ramen shop I've ever been to. I've had ramen all over California and Japan... Why even call it ramen..."}
{"text":"I have visited Republic of Ramen a second time, I was told by a friend that there was a change in management and that the overall food quality has improved. However, she is greatly mistaken.

The last time I visited, I found my tongue to be numb after the experience, I thought it was excessive use of MSG. This time, I realized, that might not have been the only case. The broth is so salty I couldn't taste the nuances of the dashi stock, if that's the stock they use. I tried adding two cups of water into the broth to dilute it out to figure out what was in the broth, but it was still too salty.

I ordered:
Shoyu Ramen (traditional) chicken with extra egg, noodles, extra chicken and extra pork
Shio Ramen (traditional) beef
Tip: 15% 
Bill: $19.47 + tip = $22.39


To say that this place is salty would be incorrect. This place uses a 'dangerous' amount of salt in my opinion. Some people say that ramen should be slurped. Well I didn't slurp the ramen, but my lips felt like a layer had been removed/dried and cured after the meal. I thought I was the only one, my companion agreed with me as well, and she uses a shoot load of salt in her cooking.

All in all, there isn't much to comment about this place, it's 'Asian Hip' in ambiance, it had a friendly sort of staff, the sake is from a box and the ramen is salty as hell (I never use hell but it deserves it here). Oh did I add, we both got food poisoning even though they received a mark of A on cleanliness?"}
{"text":"Tried to call an order in and their phone system went to a message saying that they're voicemail is full and can't accept messages. Called several times to no avail. Drove 30 min to fund out there is 45 min wait. So what do I do? Yeah I freaking wait. Oh and when. K mention that they're phone system is messed up I was given no explanation. No care in the world. I'd love if one of these would open up away from the college so we can get decent staff. Because the service here is horrible."}
{"text":"Left very disappointed and still craving good ramen.   The ramen noodles by themselves were good, but the meats were awful. The chicken was just chopped boiled chicken, the pork and beef weren't any better. They forgot my boyfriends extra toppings and were very unhelpful, then took 15 minutes to get the side of char Sui pork...which was not char Sui by definition. It looked very unappetizing. Another issue is that they only have crummy little plastic spoons which are impossible to eat a large bowl of soup with. We both ended up eating little of our broth because of the small spoons. A ramen place should have the large soup spoons. Also, my boba drink came out luke warm and watered down. We REALLY wanted to like this place, but it fell so short of great ramen."}
{"text":"Found this place totally by accident but I am so glad I did! It is such a fun and delicious place to grab some good Asian food! Being from Orange County, it has been hard finding good Asian food out here but this place nails it! They have GREAT ramen, awesome appetizers, a boba bar and snow bar, and other types of entrees (not just ramen). I have only ever eaten the ramen so I can't say much about the rest but based on how good the ramen is, I'm sure the rest is great too. They have many options and you can make it your meal just like you want! It's my go to place!"}
{"text":"My first time ever trying ramen and I really enjoyed it. I've gone back several times and got the same bowl, the miso ramen. It's so much food Ivan never finish it! The shrimp tempura is also a hit!"}
{"text":"I went here a couple months ago to grab a bowl of noodles before the Violent Femmes played. The ramen was alright. I ate most of it with out complaint....However, when I got home my stomach was tore up from the floor up. Like, not good.... And then I started reflecting back on the visit. The tables were filthy...we had to push dirty dishes aside just to sit down...they weren't packed by any means, but about 5 un-bused tables, just sitting there with dirty dishes, we needed one of the larger tables to accommodate us. 
The bathrooms were equally dirty. 
While I liked the noodles, I am not sure if my sickness was from the food, the uncleanliness of the establishment or something totally different. But ya. Not going back."}
{"text":"They ran out of boba last time I came here. :-( and it was 2.5 hours before they closed."}
{"text":"I have yet to have the food here, however, their Boba Tea is great!! I have been looking for a new place to get Boba Tea and a friend took me here a few weeks ago and I have gone several times since! They make the tea several different ways (snow, slush, etc.) and have every flavor you could imagine. My favorite is the coconut milk tea (made with black tea)..yum!! Another great one is the snow taro tea made with soy milk and black tea. If you like Boba Tea, you will love this place. Also, pretty well priced. $3.25 for a small tea which is more like a medium."}
{"text":"Awesome , good price , filling , great experience, food comes fast and is hot and taste excellent"}
{"text":"If you have ever eaten real ramen do not go here you will be sadly disappointed. Soft noodles, just straight up not good chashu (pork) and over fired gyoza. The staff was nice and friendly but the food just doesn't cut it. You are better to head down the road to Ramen Dozo or Tampopo Ramen."}
{"text":"I love this place! They have Boba and Pho style noodle soup! It's low calorie, filling and tastes so good! The staff is all super friendly and it's very chic and modern. I used to live down the street and pop in when I was feeling hungry. Theres a tanning center and a tattoo shop right next door too! It's on University near McClintock and if you know that area it's pretty good. Over all, wonderful!"}
{"text":"This place has a good selection of ramen. A bit salty but otherwise healthful. Tastes good too. The ambience is great!"}
{"text":"This place is more about the food than costumer service, not to say that the service Is bad, it's just that they're not going to try and have a conversation with you or go out of their way to make sure you enjoy your stay. Their food is pretty good, I love their ramen broth, it has great flavor. Their desserts are super yummy too!"}
{"text":"Loved it.  Light and tasty soup and chewy noodles and Spam(!),what's not to like?  Price is not bad.  In Japan ramen runs about $10 so count your blessings."}
{"text":"This place gre on me. Initially I did not like it as I felt the broth was too salty. Overtime, I discovered the chili pepper ramen which is the best one in my opinion. The broth is still on the saltier side but thats all ramen. I like their choice of meat but wish they had some kind of seafood option as well. I normally order takeout so Idk how good the service is. Sometimes their phone doesnt work so calling in is impossible-which is very annoying."}
{"text":"This place was YUMMY! Very clean, personable & GOOD food. If your looking for a healthy new taste try this place! Lots of flavors!"}
{"text":"Well at least they don't use crappy cup o' noodles right?

I got my ramen to go, i don't know if that affected my quality? Anyways lets get down to business... I got the Republic Ramen, its named after the place it has to be good.... well it's nothing to rave about really. The broth was pretty good though, nice spice but not over powering. I think i would most likely try some of their other stuff because that one either just wasn't me, nor did i think it was that \"four star\" amazing which people are raving. 

The toppings are really skimpy and cheap for a ramen place that charges as much as they do. Don't bother getting a side it is way too expensive for just 2-3 pieces. 

Don't get me wrong i'd go back.. but i don't think i will be going back because i crave them...not good enough to have me crave it. and the price, get a drink and a side and your tab jumps up...stay with just the ramen and drink water, there is enough sodium in there anyways.

Um drinks are really expensive here too, thought it would be cheaper since its right next to one of the biggest universities. guess they are trying to draw in a different crowd. The ASU flag hanging was really tacky btw. the store decor was nice besides that, had some nice flat screens to watch some game while you take your \"boo\" or \"shorty\" out somewhere besides that pub."}

Ordered 3 different ramens:
Pork Tonkatsu, Beef Miso, Beef Spicy 

Very helpful, friendly counter guy
Nice chill soothing decor
Very yummy ramen with perfect doness/chewiness
Big bowl with lots of ramen but
I could definitely eat a bit more meat for $7+ bucks
Especially for all the growing/starving ASU kids nearby
(Tempe is not Japan where cost of living is higher
 and if they wanna thrive in a college area)

My fav was the tonkatsu soup base.
Not open Sundays, not sure why not..
Could see this as a late nite after bar hangout/eatery
If it stays open later like 11pm/midnite
Yeah Im a night owl

We all liked Republic Ramen and will be back!"}
{"text":"I went here with a friend, she really wanted to try it. We have tried a lot of Ramen places and were hoping we found a new hot spot. This was NOT what we expected. We both ordered differently (floating) and both were very disappointing. They basically tasted the same. I got three pieces of beef and most of her pork was just white fat pieces. Yuck...

On the other hand we also order the Gyoza and Shrimp Tempura. Those where pretty good, but the price didn't match. I got three pieces of shrimp for $4. But hey this review is for the taste not the price."}
{"text":"Super happy with my first experience here. I brought my boyfriend so he could try ramen for the first time and we where not let down. The Naruto was a bit thin but everything else was amazing!!! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant with my boyfriend on Saturday night. The food was OK. The girl at the register was super nice and very informative. But there was a major problem. When the noodles came they had a little pellets call fishcakes on top. 
I asked the server what kind of fish was it. I'm allergic to shrimp. I ask her to check. She went in the back came back and said she read the ingredients and said it had no shrimp but didn't seem as sure of herself. So I said as a precaution I asked her to take it back and remake it without the fish pellets on top. 
The soup came back fairly quickly so that was impressive until I started eating and in the bottom was one of the little fish pellets still floating around. Looks like to me they went to the back and just took them off. Wow! I was so upset considering the whole purpose was to have it remade in the event it did have a shellfish type fish in it. My boyfriend was super upset and completely turned off. He felt like that was pretty dangerous considering had I accidentally eaten it and he it did have some type of shellfish in it and I had a reaction it would've been bad.
Guess someone should talk to this restaurant about not taking a chance with someone and how an allergy reaction it's so dangerous. Wouldn't be good to have an ambulance pulling up to the front of your restaurant because you were too lazy to remake a bowl of Udon noodles"}
{"text":"Walking in, the environment is nice enough and there is immediately a register with the menu above and relatively customizable options. The staff is friendly but they only need to interact with you for a minute or so when taking your order. There are a number of topping options for 50 cents or a dollar such as extra veggies, meat and noodles in case you want more. Beware of adding toppings because there is little addition and it can make your bill much more than you expect. They also have udon if ramen texture is just not for you. I got the vegetarian ramen but I kept the naruto because seafood is my guilty pleasure.
As I was sitting I noticed how spacious the interior was to seat a large number of people. Within few minutes, the order came out which is much appreciated since I am alone and it's awkward waiting for extended periods of time. As I take my first bite I can tell that there is a lot of salt in the broth and there is a thick soy sauce taste. It has a bitter aftertaste as well. The noodles are good but not great they have the texture of noodles that sink in your teeth rather than bounce back which is what I call \"lacking bite.\" I decided to add chili pepper from the area that has the fountain drinks, napkins and utensils, since the broth is otherwise dimensionless.You could come out satisfied by the quantity of food but the quality is just subpar. I'm sure they have other more popular options that I can try but with fast casual dining they really need to sell it on the taste of the food."}
{"text":"Wow what big portions!  Yummy sides and broth!  It was fun to pick and choose and the employees were super nice!  The wait was a bit long but wasn't the cashiers fault her swiper was not working very well.  It was a nice dimmed room but music was kinda loud!  It's the kind of dish where even when your done it doesn't look like you even made a dent!  My husband lived in Japan and he was impressed!  Yeah another local fav!!  We can even ride our bikes it's so close!"}
{"text":"One of the best ramen places in Phoenix! I had the tonokotsu ramen with gyoza, and it was delicious. They just serve so much in a bowl that I was only able to eat so much before I got full. All in all it was a great place"}
{"text":"I love the ramen, but the wait time is always long.  They over a good variety and the dining area is pretty big."}
{"text":"Coming from LA, I always crave good ramen. Knowing I can't place the same high standards as back home places, I didn't think this place was that bad. I was actually pretty surprised. I'd been to cherry blossom and didn't like theirs.  
I had the Tokyo ramen which they say is a light and spicy tonkotsu ramen with the original toppings. It is lighter than a normal tonkotsu broth but certainly was not spicy at all. But flavor was pretty decent. I liked that the original toppings came with spinach and carrots.  For the price (I think it was $7.50) you got a really good sized bowl. 
Bf had the republic ramen which was a pretty spicy one.  He did say that the spiciness builds up.  I didn't think his broth was as flavorful as mine but he still liked it lots. Interestingly my bf didn't eat all his noodles so I got to eat part of his too and his noodles tasted differently.  And it's not bc of the broths so not sure if the noodles are dif. 
Place is clean and staff was pretty good. For all those times you can't go to Cali for ramen and having a craving, this is a pretty decent sub."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a chilly night when I wasn't feeling so well. Was slightly disappointed with the amount of sides that they ran out of. The woman who assisted me was not that pleasant nor helpful for assisting a first timer. When asked to describe the difference between some of the broths, she seemed as if she was not familiar. The place was packed and did provide a warm vibe. The ramen was pretty standard. Not sure I'll be coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"Not a very good experience.  Wanted to like this place but it was very disappointing.   Long line and understaffed.   Ordered Ice tea, was very watery and tasted like tap water , plus  had no ice in the machine. Had to ask twice for them to refill the ice.    Overall poorly managed restaurant. Ramen was mediocre.  If you have a choice,  go to Umami, it is a night and day difference in quality and service."}
{"text":"It's definitely edible, but I don't think it was good. I probably won't return here. I had the tonkatsu ramen with original toppings. I was really disappointed with my dish. The ramen was grossly overcooked. The noodles had been over soaked with the broth and showed signs of being overcooked. The noodles were so swollen that they seemed to fall apart when you tried to pick it up for eating. The broth itself was nothing to brag about. I also ordered an egg for an extra cost. To my dismay, the egg was just a hardboiled egg rather than the soft cooked egg that usually comes with ramen. Also, I want to note that I love bamboo shoots. But, there was definitely too much bamboo shoots added as part of the original toppings. I do not recommend this restaurant and I will not be back."}
{"text":"Been looking for a good Ramen place since I moved out here from SD and the search will continue. What is sad is that they have potential...the Tonkatsu Base was delicious and the noodles were perfect...it's everywhere else where it fell apart. The proteins were god awful. 
I ordered the beef, with Char Siu added and the beef was fatty, unseasoned, and overcooked beyond recognition. They forgot my Char Siu, and since they had charged me 2$ for it I went up to ask for it (politely! mistakes happen, no big) and was argued with. Finally she checks my receipt and sees that I did in fact order/pay for it so she says she'll bring it right over.
5 minutes later...
10 minutes later...
15 minutes later it finally comes, my soup is cold and at this point I'm overall extremely dissatisfied. But maybe I'll have some delicious BBQ pork to turn this failure train around. Nope! Look, I'm not an expert on the subject, but this is what char siu is supposed to look like 
https://www.google.com/search?q=Char+Siu&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS703US703&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjjsJTNmL3OAhWI7CYKHUHbBrIQ_AUICCgB&biw=2560&bih=1339#imgrc=2EhyTZLYBwU-2M%3A
Instead I get paper thin sliced, steamed, unseasoned/overcooked mystery meat that was indistinguishable from the beef except for a slight taste of wet blanket. What makes Char Siu, well...Char Siu, is the Char Siu Sauce that it's glazed in before grilling. Unseasoned/Unsauced steamed pork is just not the same thing. 
Apparently this is not just limited to the beef and the pork as the Chicken Shoyu Ramen my girlfriend ordered was just as bad. They just boiled the chicken and threw it in the broth. While the broth was flavorful the chicken was dry, overcooked, unseasoned...man, I'm detecting a pattern here. 
Look, when there are three protein options, at least get one of them right. 

Small nitpicky stuff: The spoons are horrible. Now I know, I sound crazy, but follow me here: When you get ramen or Udon you get a large chinese soup spoon. These are great because they hold a large amount of broth, and serve as a base to catch what drips off your noodles. All they have here are small plastic stirring spoons, like what you use to stir ice tea. These are just not the same, and trying to eat a massive bowl of soup a tea spoon at a time feels like bailing out a boat with a tea cup. 

All in all I was extremely disappointed. I guess the hunt for decent ramen continues!"}
{"text":"Seen the restaurant many times driving by.  Today I decided to take the bait.  Decor n setting in main eating area is fine but. ...I used the bathroom,  it was dirty. The kitchen is right across the restrooms n the kitchen looked dirty.  Hmmm...should I order? I'm a risk taker, so I order a bowl of Ramen. 
Service was ok, girl taking our order wasn't happy or welcoming.  Server didn't say a word,  dropped off our food but didn't say anything like \"enjoy\". Order came out quickly tho.  
First taste was good but I started to notice my tongue hurting from the saltiness of the broth. Next thing I notice was the heaviness of the noodles...couldn't eat too much. 
Bottom line,  I think I'll stick with Pho."}
{"text":"Honestly this place used to have really good ramen, quality ingredients, good meat, fresh veggies, top quality additions to the ramen. But the last few time I've been, it just been over cooked and soggy. Everything. A slight increase over microwave.

Not sure what happened but I'm looking for other places around town now."}
{"text":"I love Ramen! And this place is a Ramen-Lovers dream! If you want to explore for-real ramen fir the first time. This is the place to go.

I'm all about the Chili Pepper Ramen. Shoyu broth with extra-thinly sliced pork, garlic, and green Thai chilis. To die for. I must admit that some of the broths can be overly salty though. The Shio Ramen, made from seasalt, is a kick to the heart. But all their side's and boba drinks are delicious. 
Service is a little lax for my liking. No uniforms or anything. I was confused the first time I walked in because I didn't know who was working and who wasnt. Otherwise, great spot"}
{"text":"The food was reasonable and definitely tasted better than regular cheap ramen noodles.  Noodles here are way better than the packaged stuff.  This was a bit expensive, some, for noodles, in my opinion, but I guess in this area, the price is okay.

Service is okay, but when I asked for take out boxes or for anything outside of initially ordering, the server wasn't too great with this and basically said she would get it for us, but never did.  

Food is 4 stars, service 3 stars.  The place is, however, big, clean and inviting."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time this past week, even though I drive by it every day on the way to work. I have never had Ramen in any form before, but I like new food, so I gave it a whirl. I decided to try the Tokyo Ramen with pork and I thought it was very good. Not too spicy, so I added some more via their condiment bar. You get a ton of food and I was barely able to make a dent before I was full. 

The service was good, restaurant clean, and food delicious. I'll be back to try another one of their flavors!"}
{"text":"In the grand scheme of Phoenix area noodle shops, this place is average.  I ordered the spicy tonkatsu soup with chicken for lunch one day this week - it came out piping hot and in a huge bowl.  The spice was subtle but definitely present, and the cloudy pork broth had pretty good flavor.  The noodles were what was most mediocre in my mind - they were a little chewy and definitely weren't as good as Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe's.  Toppings were light (compared to the picture next to the menu board) but adequate.

I may come back, but for a noodle lunch near work I definitely prefer Khai Hoan."}
{"text":"This place is so failsauce compared to that of real ramen.  The noodles were reminiscent of instant noodles more so than actual ramen.  The broth served was barely lukewarm.  It seemed as if they just melted a few bouillon cubes rather than it being cooked from actual ingredients.  I went there all excited that Arizona had a place dedicated to ramen and left so disappointed.   I really wanted to love the place. 

The seaweed salad and kimchi were quite good however but again for a place that is titled Republic Ramen, one would think the focus would be on the actual ramen.  If you go to Ranch Market you can buy the Asian instant noodles and have a better tasting experience.  

Although Toh San isn't great by any means - it was MUCH better than Republic Ramen.   If you get a chance to visit NYC - please visit Ippudo.  It'll introduce you to real ramen."}
{"text":"Oh hello, delicious!  

Craving a big ol' bowl of yummy ramen? Look no further than Republic Ramen + Noodles. 

Dude and I really enjoyed this place. Judging by the outside, you wouldn't expect to find this Tempe gem. 

You walk in, and order at the counter and someone brings your ramen out to you. Both fountain and alcoholic beverages available, and know there's a Boba shop in here as well. 

Clean, comfortable, open atmosphere with minimalist design with wooden benches and tables. 

I had the Chili Ramen with Beef, Traditional Toppings, 8/10 spiciness, and Dude had the Republic Ramen with Beef, also with Traditional Toppings. 

These bowls are HUGE and we could have easily shared one, but hey, lunch leftovers for work the next day. 

Plenty of kick from that spice, and the beef was not fatty at all. Thinly sliced and tender. The noodles were just right, not overcooked. 

I'm no ramen expert, but damn, this was yummy. 

So mad we overlooked this joint for so long. Will definitely be back, and dragging my ASU brother along for a nice free meal on the big sis!"}
{"text":"If you want a salt fix in liquid form, this is the place for you. I had the Tonkatsu ramen and it was ALARMINGLY salty, to the point where I just gave up halfway through the bowl (and probably should have done so earlier). The noodles and toppings were pretty good but even for a salt lover like me, the broth was much too much. Bad start to my ramen search in Phoenix. Points for a clean, modern atmosphere inside the restaurant, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"So delicious! My sister got the Republic Ramen with chicken and it was a little spicy but so good. I got the Chili Pepper Ramen with beef. The beef was thinly sliced and super yummy! I actually liked my sisters ramen flavor more but both were great!"}
{"text":"Another ramen joint trying to capitalize on the uber popular ramen craze. This place screams, \"We're in the business to make money, not food!\" The interior looks like a cobbled up mess, at least the boba serving side did. Speaking of which, why is this place attached to a boba store? 

The ramen here is mediocre at best. I have had much better ramen both in the East Coast (Ippudo, Totto, etc.) and the West Coast (Daikokuya, etc.) within the same price range. The tonkotsu ramen, which apparently is there best seller, did not have any depth in the broth. The noodles were bloated/somewhat soggy and there additional sides were just awful (ex. What should have been menma (fermented bamboo shoots) was just plain hard bamboo cut up). Lets not forget the char siu, which I guess to them is non-roasted thinly sliced pork similarly used in Korean bbq. 

In summary, yes this place is better than your $.10-$.25 bag of ramen, but $7-$8? I don't think so. I only came here since I frequent AZ for business and it was a chilly day which in turn made me crave something soupy. As a Japanese American, I searched for the perfect Japanese comfort food to fulfill my soup craving. Unfortunately, all I found was a mediocre noodle joint which falsely represented the traditional Japanese noodle soup dish."}
{"text":"I've tried other ramen and pho places, but I keep coming back to Republic Ramen! It is my go to place for a delicious Japanese-style Ramen. There are numerous choices for additional  ingredients to make your soup extra special for an additional $.50 to $1.50. Today I ordered  the spicy Tokyo Ramen with pork, adding in extra bamboo shoots, green onions, and double of their toothsome noodles to the broth. You have a choice of original  or traditional Japanese ingredients in your broth. Yum! Meats are slice super thin plus they also offer tofu, if you prefer. Besides traditional sodas, they have two great flavored ice teas, and a variety of delicious Boba teas so you can drink dessert with you lunch! ( The \"Sno\" desserts shop is now  attached to Republic Ramen. Try one and fall in love---  Chocolate, mango, coffee, melon ---similar to shaved ice but 100 times better!!!
The facilities are pretty basic but clean and the crew is helpful with any questions. Must. Go. Back. Soooon !"}
{"text":"This was my go-to spot for Ramen in college. I love their ramen, but just be aware that if you are adding topping to what is already included in the bowl, it can start to get a little bit pricey! Yummy food and quick service!"}
{"text":"The staff were very nice.  I must have had a miscommunication with the cashier because I specified I'd like pork, and she took that to mean I wanted extra pork, apparently, because of the biil.  I should have said something before I paid because the price didn't add up, but whatever, that's kind of on me.

I thought the broth was very good.  The soba was pretty good.  My bowl was humongous, inappropriately so. I left half of the broth after finishing my noodles and everything else.  If there was \"extra pork\" then it must be pretty skimpy on the reg., or they just gave me the regular amount and charged me for extra.  For a regular portion it was fine.  I really just wanted more noodles to go with the sea of broth.

The place seemed super clean.  The clientele seemed like the sort you'd see in a Stuff White People Like blog post.  That's not a good or a bad thing."}
{"text":"Awesome place if you want a big bowl of REAL ramen, not the 25 cent packages you make at home. Been here a couple times already and every time the staff is very friendly and our food comes out pretty fast! They have house saki that comes in every flavor that the house teas come in! Not a big fan of boba, but if you are they have tons of selection for you!"}
{"text":"I have to agree with several other traveled reviewers on here and say that the ramen here is very MEH.
I only eat here because there are very few ramen places in the phoenix area and my friends like ramen. The flavor, texture of the noodles, and warmth of the broth is really not there and that is what ramen is supposed to be about! However, I must commend them on their large portion sizes because they do give you a really big bowl. 
This place isn't going anywhere because ASU is nearby.

If you have to HAVE ramen and don't want to drive, then fine, get it here. But there are definitely other options that are better in the valley."}
{"text":"I LOVE Republic Ramen. I have been holding my birthday and friends' surprise birthday parties here now for a couple of years, because the food is delicious and inexpensive, the staff are very nice, and among my friends and I, we all just love ramen. My typical order is a tonkotsu ramen (very rich, creamy pork broth) and a thai iced tea boba! It is absolutely delicious, and even while writing this review, I am now craving some ramen from here. I have tried to recreate their tonkotsu broth at my home with no such luck! It is simply the best from here!

Also, for me personally, Cherry Blossum cafe was not nearly as good as Republic Ramen, it was just not as satisfying in the broth. I know everyone is different, but that is just my two cents! I will continue recommend Republic Ramen to all of my friends!"}
{"text":"Saw them on Check, Please Arizona.
I got the rame that starts with a 'T' and it isn't the Tokyo one.  
It was...decent.  Nothing to rave about but still a good meal; 7 out of 10.
Also ordered the gyoza and they were well cooked and flavorful.  Sauce was nondescript.
The service consisted of ordering at the cashier and having our food brought to us.  Both experiences were perfectly fine, and the cashier (Vanessa?) was very friendly.
Two others ate with me and they both commented that their ramen was good but they've had better.  I can't remember which ones they ordered but one had a very light broth and the other an almost brown broth.  
I must say it was all fresh.  The ingredients were not skimpy and the portion size was big.  
A very middle-of-the-road experience.
Atmosphere is very open and public with big benches and tables inside, and a small area outside to eat at.
If you like ramen, I can't highly recommend this place but I would say you could do much worse."}
{"text":"I only came here because Shady Park was closed and it was a terrible experience. After I ordered within two minutes I got my food- but it was the wrong order- the person who brought it to me noticed that it was missing the egg but didn't notice that it was entirely the wrong meat and broth. Regardless he didn't come back and I had to carry my huge bowl of ramen to the counter. 30 seconds later I got my actual order and the girl exclaimed \"they re-made it for you\" and brought me a side of cold hard boiled egg. The whole reason to pay the extra $1 for egg is to get a hot soft boiled egg in your broth. The egg was gray in the middle from being over-boiled. The soup itself was awful to say the least, and you have to eat it with disposable chopsticks and a metal ramen spoon. Now on top of it my boyfriend and I both have an upset stomach from eating here. Avoid this place, there's plenty of good ramen in Tempe."}
{"text":"Very big portions, with flavorful, distinct broth options.  My favorite broth so far is the tonkatsu ramen.  There are a lot of different add-ons you can put in the soup, and I was happy to see that they had tea eggs on the menu!  They also have bubble tea, but the tapioca I had tasted old and soggy, and it was very flavorless (taro milk tea).  The tempura is also very good- very crispy with fresh vegetables."}
{"text":"Add instant ramen, add a slice of beef, commercialize it as hip, sell for 8 dollars = Satanism. No Thank You Republic Ramen, No Thank You and Never Again."}
{"text":"Coming from Seattle with lots of good Japanese food, and moved to the desert, gives me a bit of pessimistic thoughts about this place. It is the only ramen place in Phoenix and just opened this March. We visited this place for lunch on Sunday. But after entering the door and feel the atmosphere, I had a good feeling already. The cashier was so passionate about his products and explained how the menu works in 3 minutes presentation, very impressive... I tried what he recommended , the tonkatsu noodle, the usual choice I make in Seattle. The price was cheap too for the huge portion they serve ($6.95/bowl). This is definitely a place to hang out if you want to not spend lots of money but still going home full. 
I love his recommendation! And we tried the shrimp tempura appertizer as well, and the garlic sweet sauce is just addictive! 
I recommend this place and definitely will come again!"}
{"text":"I had the Republic Ramen with original toppings and tofu. The broth was my favorite part because it had just the right amount of heat. I really enjoyed the ramen just beware that the portions are huge! I also got the mango snow boba. It was a little too sweet for my taste but still very delicious. The food came really fast, went here at around 7 pm."}
{"text":"The ramen is mediocre--all of it needs added sauce/powder to really give it a kick. I like all the seemingly fresh veggies. After dinner I went to the ladies room. It's disgusting and looks like a gas station bathroom. The lights were off and when I turned them on several COCKROACHES scurried about. I wanted to vomit, I had just eaten, had it been before I'd of demanded my money back and bailed. Gross."}
{"text":"This places is AWESOME!! I have tried a lot of their items on the menu now and you have to try it! It is so filling and tastes delicious. At night it's a nice atmosphere and I love to come here with my husband and spend some time together eating our ramen! Try the Shoyu Ramen with original toppings and add corn, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Decor was nice, with a modern touch.

Customer Service:

Walked into the restaurant, and went straight to the counter. I immediately asked if I can sit myself. I did, thinking there was going to be a waiter who would take my order. I waited a few minutes and noticed that people are lining up to the counter placing their orders before sitting themselves. So, I stood up and went behind the line. This time, Im the 8th customer on the line. The person behind the counter (Barclay with a brit accent) didnt bother to tell me that I have to order from the counter and then sit myself...WTF! Employees seems  like ASU students who couldnt care less about what we say with regards to their customer service skills. No enthusiam at all. I dont blame them, this isnt their career anyway. They are just passing by. Try ramen houses in Los Angeles area, the servers are as enthusiastic as the servers in Japan.  Yes, I have lived in Japan for 4 years, thats how I know.

Thai Tea w/ boba:
How can someone F this up anyway? It's good.

The Ramen: ( had the miso ramen with pork)
I guess its good for being in AZ. The broth actually has a flavor, powdered flavor. I didnt like the pork tho. Their ramen includes a spinach, a welcome difference/change and I liked it.


My biggest pet peeve from a \"ramen house,\" is when they use disposable chopsticks and plastic bowls!!!! And yes, Republic Ramen is guilty of these.


If youre expecting an authentic ramen from this place, you might just as well be disappointed.


Another employee gave me the thai tea for free, because someone forgot to prepare one for me. I offered to pay, but he said its okay and not to worry about it."}
{"text":"Easy going Atmosphere. One the best Ramen I have had in years (that is not homemade or in Japan). The soup base taste perfect the way it is, no additional sauce needed!"}
{"text":"Their Raman is not professional, and not even near professional. The tastes are all different every time I came for the same item. Too salty this time...I mean really salty! Disappointed..."}
{"text":"Eh, this place is pretty solid, but I'd have to come here again to give it a higher star rating. As it stands, I'd have to agree with the people who said that the broth isn't really all that complex. It's fine, but it tastes more like it came from a dehydrated packet than from a huge stockpot in the back full of pork bones, roasted veggies, and spices. I might be wrong, but I just wasn't overwhelmed. I had the Republic ramen bowl with pork, and it was fine. The noodles were really good, but I was hoping for a slightly spicier broth. The rest of the ingredients were fine as well, and the bamboo shoots were nice and decently firm. If I came here again, tried another bowl, and enjoyed it, I'd easily give this place another star, but I wasn't impressed enough with what I had to give it a solid four-star rating. As it is, though, it's not bad, and a decent place for lunch if you don't mind a bit of the 'itis' after some slurping."}
{"text":"I think the concept is good but I wasn't impressed with the staff or the prices.  Flavor-wise it was adequate but not food that brings me back for more.  In fact, while eating I was thinking:  I could have had a bowl of tom yum pork instead elsewhere for the same price and from much more friendly people...  It's not full service; you order at a counter."}
{"text":"This place has good ramen and very good vegetable tempura. The service kills the whole experience unfortunately. The employees are disgruntled, inattentive and over all give off a \"I don't want to be here and don't want to assist you\" vibe. I had to repeat my self several times, wasn't asked if I had any questions yet alone greeted. At least fake the service and act like you want to be here. Overall a terrible experience simply due due to the atrocious service."}
{"text":"Great food, great people, great atmosphere.... i could go on! My daughter loves boba snow and Tony makes it the best. They have tons of teas too! The RAMEN IS VERY YUMMY! Plenty to share with someone!"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times with friends and definitely recommend it. The food is decent, the portions are huge, and it's never too crowded. One of my biggest fears when eating out is not being full when I leave, and that is especially true at noodle houses; however, Republic Ramen serves their noodles up in gigantic bowls that will challenge you to finish them and slurp up all that you can.

Ramen is what you make of it, and you aren't doing yourself any favors if you don't add some spices. Be adventurous and don't be afraid to try things that you can't pronounce. You'll thank me later.

P.S. the attached boba bar is decent. It may not be the best boba in the world, but the huge variety of flavors that they will let you mix and match can lead to some surprisingly savory drinks!"}
{"text":"I was SHOCKED at the size of the bowls here!

For some reason, the pictures don't really capture the how much food you actually get.

Me, wife daughter and 18 month old son came here for my birthday dinner ( Don't ask how old I am, I will lie)

I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen..original toppings..added pork, and extra bamboo shoots.
Also got an order of Gyoza. Lemme tell ya...I could have eaten 5 plates of those bad boys!
The broth was delish, but was rather subdued.  That can be a good thing, if you have an aversion to excess sodium. I took the leftover dipping sauce for my gyoza, and poured it into my ramen. Perfect!
The sliced pork was really tender.
To drink, I got the Green Apple Boba tea, with green tea.
YUMM!!  My daughter got the passion fruit, and that was super yummy, too!
The only reason I gave 4 stars and not 5, is that I DO have an aversion to excess sodium. Hahah. 
Regardless, we will be back."}
{"text":"Got here at 7:45pm on a Saturday and didn't get our food until 8:40pm (party of 2 only). This place was almost full with only 3 empty tables.

I had a glimpse of the kitchen on my way to the restroom and noticed only one guy in the kitchen. He had bowls of ramen lined up and seemed to be  haphazardly tossing toppings into each bowl...with his BARE HANDS. If you are going to do that I expect my Ramen to be ready in 10 minutes. 

Quality of Ramen is below average. The temperature of the broth was lukewarm, not the typical hot of most ramen places. The ingredients in the Ramen were mediocre to say the least. NO complimentary HALF-EGG??? I guess this is what you should expect when you pay $8 for a bowl."}
{"text":"Awesome ramen! Flavorful broths and toppings. Noodles are great too. Love this place."}
{"text":"East and West coast people who are mourning a decent Ramen place look no further. Delicious food, good sides. The best tempura I have had in a long time.  Casual yet hip place. Great service. Great place!"}
{"text":"I can't believe a Japanese person could eat an entire bowl of this ramen but the waitperson insisted it is authentic. I have to give it to them -- it's the best ramen I've ever had!

When you walk in, there's a certain way of ordering. You pick a base soup and then add ingredients. If you are having any trouble figuring it out, the helpful staff, with names like Shiloh and Moonbeam will be glad to help you out.

The huge bowls are reasonably priced and extremely filling, so if you order a side dish, you can forget about finishing. Probably better to go in knowing you'll come out with half of it left over for dinner."}
{"text":"I barehand a slim slice of the melt in your mouth beef from the mound and dip it in sriracha sauce, devouring it in one bite. I prefer the traditional toppings. Nori seaweed, a root veggie I can't identify, Naruto (kage bunshin no tasty!) and plenty of scallions. Get an egg upgrade because they offer high-end brown eggs, the egg yolk ups the ante for richness in your broth and compliments the salty undertones.

A number of other yelpers fault RR for being too salty; yet they fail to realise salt is a key component of a well executed ramen. You can also balance it out with sriracha sauce. All toppings have been fresh, the broth is always piping hot. There is a lot going on yet everything compliments each other. There is diversity between each bite using your spoon for customization. Even with the restaurant 2/3rds full my ramen came to me in just over 5 minutes.

I'm 6'4 280 and its a challenge for me to take down these portions making RR an insanely strong value. You're looking at between $7-9 for your ramen plus a delicious egg.

Only one gripe. Make the courtesy water cup size bigger, its kinda annoying considering that this food does have high salt content and I can maybe get 3ish sips before its empty. I may bring in my BPA free water jug so this is no longer an issue but I don't want to start a confrontation."}
{"text":"If you have any allergies or diet restrictions, do not go here. The staff was not very helpful to us and thought the answer \"I am not sure\" was satisfactory! After talking to four different people, we were able to order. The food itself was pretty good and comes in large portions."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed coming here because ramen is sooooo good
It is not the .10 cent bags you can make on your own... 
I must say that these are huge bowls and I recommend one bowl to two people. They are huge! My favorite is the Tonkotsu Ramen which is a pork flavored broth and I add pork meat. Ramen would be the perfect \"sickness\" meal or the perfect \"hangover\" meal. I love that they have chili powder and Sriracha that you can add into your bowl. I must say that I do not like the small water cups though, they are tiny. Other than that everything is wonderful and I hope you enjoy your bowl of ramen :)"}
{"text":"Best hangover meal I can think of is a streaming bowl of spicy ramen from Republic."}
{"text":"I love ramen, and I am not talking about the cheap garbage you buy from the grocery store.  I love the good stuff, and Republic Ramen does it right.

I ordered the extra spicy Republic Ramen with chicken, and it was great.  I enjoyed it so much.  Every drop of the soup was a symphony of sensation on my taste buds.  I was in heaven, but I am getting ahead of myself.

We started the dinner with an order of Shrimp Purses and Gyoza.  The price was four and three dollars respectively, and they came out in a hurry.  They were fresh, and they were great.  They were gone in a flash.

The main course was in a gigantic bowl, and that was way more than I could eat in a sitting.  I mostly ate the excellent broth, and I took the rest home to eat that night.  Man, I loved that place so much.  I will definitely go there again.

A+++ in my book!"}
{"text":"Maybe it's because it's the middle of summer and all the ASU kids are gone, but this place was pretty dead for dinner.  The ramen was okay.  The broth was not as temperature-hot as I would have preferred.  But the gyoza was quite delicious.  I was disappointed that the ramen was not as flavorful as I expected.  I'd come back, but maybe next time, I'd set lower expectations."}
{"text":"For those who likes ramen must try Nishikawa Ramen. Unlike this Republic Ramen, customer service is horrible. I simply asked for extra noodle on the side and extra egg... They gave me my bowl with just broth and 1 set of noodles, with no extra, on the side. So they remade my order. My remade order has 2 sets of noodles, but 0 eggs. The kid w/ acne scars who took my order said, \"I asked you if you want your noodles on the side. I work here all the time!.\""}
{"text":"This place has improved tremendously, the quality and flavor is much better than it had been, it tastes like when they first opened. The menu had also been expanded. For anyone who hasn't been I recommend you give it a try and anyone who had been put off by a prior visit, I suggest you give Republic another chance.. Maybe try something different this time. The tonkotsu was great with te addition of corn and an egg, and the Sopporo was pretty good too. To even out the review I will say I'm not sure why they decided they needed to shower the kimchi with scallions or why the seaweed salad was so sweet, not in a bad way, just different. they need to perfect their noodles a bit, but it won't stop me from coming back.  :)"}
{"text":"I had to eat here at least once, and would eat here more often if it were in a more convenient location for me.  Have you ever wanted to try real ramen?  News flash -- the 99 cent packages of \"ramen\" at the grocery store is just about one of the worst things you can stick into you body and can hardly be called food at all.  If you feel insulted by this sentence, then I would not recommend Republic Ramen + Noodles, but if you were intrigued by my question, look up the address immediately.  Besides, and I haven't done extensive research on this, but I believe that instant ramen in Japan comes with the broth, which leads me to believe that they don't even have what we call \"ramen\" in Japan.  For those who are neither insulted nor intrigued, just keep in mind that you are ordering soup for your meal.  If that won't fill you up, consider an appetizer.  There are a variety of styles and ingredients that you must select from.  Naturally, I ordered naruto with my ramen.  The reason for this will be left unpublished.  All that is missing is counter side dining with privacy drapes."}
{"text":"Who knew Ramen could be so much fun? I came here for the first time last night with John C, and I absolutely loved it!  Both of us had not been feeling well lately, and he suggested we come here to self medicate and that the food was awesome.  I loved it!  

I really like how this place is decorated.  It feels comfortable, with benches and chairs, plenty of seating and a fair amount of room to move in.  No blasting music, very relaxing, but it feels clean and nice.

Anyways, I have never been here before, so in between my friend and the girl behind the counter, I was able to figure out what it was I wanted.  They have a ton of options, from meatless dishes, to stuff with chicken, pork, and even alcohol options to drink as well.   I went with a vegetable clear broth with chicken chunks, and my friend ordered a vegatarian thing since he doesn't eat meat.  They answered all my questions and gave me a lot of options to choose from.  Staff here is patient, and seems to not only know their menu, but take the time to answer questions to make sure your happy with what you order.

The food came out in a HUGE bowl.  It's like eating a hearty bowl of soup, with tons of good stuff in it.  I got through about half, and was STUFFED.  my friend ate about three quarters, and was stuffed as well.  We both have leftovers!  Total bill with drinks was about $20.  love it! I can eat a hearty meal, with left overs and not break the bank!

Will be back in the future, weather its just for dinner, or drinks as well.  Go here and try this place!"}
{"text":"just wanted to try it to see what it was like. it's nothing to write home about. the food is ok, but a little pricey for what you get, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Love coming here and love eating in. Just wish that they had sturdier take out containers (bigger ones too) and that they didn't separate the noodles and the broth when it's take out. Otherwise, eating in is great. Only reason I docked a star is that it would be nice if they wouldn't let people clip their nails in a restaurant as not only is that totally disgusting, but I'm pretty sure that's gotta be violating some sort of health code. Love this place anyway. 

Oops, also forgot. Sometimes nobody picks up the phone even if you call repeatedly and you'll get their voicemail which is full. Aaaand the chicken was not great at all (I compare it to the likes of the chicken in canned soup but worse and blander) so I always order mine without any meat. Otherwise, still love it."}
{"text":"Never thought much about Ramen noodles and how you can really make a meal of it.  Generally, it's one of those college foods you eat when you're dead broke and starving.  I can appreciate taking a simple dish and making it the main feature of the restaurant.  The noodles here is good and spicy I must say - if you need more spice; grab yourself a bottle of Siracha.  I can't handle my spice like I used to and it was just right for me.  Decor was simple Ikea like furniture - nothing wrong as long as it works.  Service was good with a friendly smile.  If I ever need another Ramen fix and feel lazy to make my own - I know where to go now.  There's a little boba shop connected to Republic so don't forget to grab some with your meal.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I came here from out of town and I had a really good experience. Tom was dope, he went above and beyond to help my family with our orders.  The boba was bomb and the ramen was pretty good. Tom was a really good guy and made our experience super dope."}
{"text":"First time coming, I saw the place twice coming out of Tempe Improv and was always curious. Met a girl on tinder and we agreed to meet at this place since we both never tried it. The guy at the cashier was very nice and helpful. I was nervous and I she was as well. We both orders the miso one which was to die for. It was so good. If I didn't have a beautiful chick in front of me I would of devoured that bowl like a Game of Thrones character who hasn't ate for months. I love it and will def be going back. Plus you guys popped my Ramen noodle cherry!"}
{"text":"Republic is great. The service is fantastic and they truly bust their ass to bring the customer the highest quality ramen in this part of town. The prices are fantastic as you can get a huge bowl of delicious ramen for a mere $7 max. When I went I got the tonkotsu (awesome pork broth) with pork and naruto (I would also recommend, of course, an egg but they took all their eggs out of circulation because of a state?wide or countywide recall).

Really cool honesty and professional call on that as even though, as our waiter explained, that their eggs were organic and locally raised and completely unaffected it was better to be safe than sorry and save face if somebody were to ask questions concerning the eggs, BUT I digress. 

The ramen was made FAST and served beautifully. The fixings, condiments, and utensils were all abundant, varied, and self-serve and I found that so convenient and well thought-out. Drinks are cheap and self-served and their boba was great. 

I highly recommend the mango-almond snow and the taro-blueberry snow. My only con to the boba would have to be that it's a bit of a wait (between 10 and 20 minutes) but that's only because they have to boil the tapioca to order but at least you know you're getting a good product made fresh. Either way, it's a ramen joint and there aren't too many places around the Tempe ASU campus that sells boba, nonetheless fantastic tasting boba like this place. Best way to do it is to order your boba for dessert about halfway through your ramen so you can have sweet slushy finish to your salty, warm broth dinner. Drink water during your ramen as to not muddle and disrespect the ramen's flavor.

Service was great and really you can't ask for more than a friendly-face and enthusiastic service in a cheap high pace college ramen joint that is beautifully decorated and cranking out delicious soups minute after minute for the hordes of broke college kids and hungry twenty-somethings looking for something else than In-N-Out. 

Grab your girl or dude, order some ramen, get some boba, sit back, and enjoy."}
{"text":"Had the republic ramen with original toppings and pork (on recommendation from the girl at the counter). Good bowl of soup, never had ramen before except the .25 cent bags. Wasn't a fan of the pork, too much fat for me but the noodles and vegetables were great. Will I come back? Sure, but 9 times out of 10 I'll drive around the corner and get Pho instead."}
{"text":"The freshly made broth is amazing!  I've had 3 different ones so far and they are all great!  I personally love the thick udon noodles too.  The Thai Tea boba could have been better.  One order of soup really feeds 2 people or a 2nd serving at home."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time last night and it was Really good! Of course not as good as you get in Japan or like even Ippudo in NYC but it is the best I have found in AZ and defiantly fulfilled my ramen craving! Not sure why they got so many bad reviews? Maybe they have improved since first opening? Anyways I had the tonkatsu with traditional toppings and an egg. Pros- rich yummy porky broth, perfectly chewy noodles, bomb bamboo shoots and naruto! ( the little swirls make me so happy ) cons- pork could be more tender and the egg was NOT a proper ramen egg. It should have a soft medium yolk not a dry crumbly yolk. Overall though I was so happy with my big bowl of ramen! Very delicious! Costumer service was fine not wow but not bad. We will defiantly be going back!"}
{"text":"Got the chili pepper ramen and it was yummy!   Perfectly spicy and packed with flavor.  

Minus a few stars for the ordering process (for some reason it took forever and the cashier seemed to be confused), the boba (just not as delicious as I'm used to), and the fact that the beef was in one massive strip that was way too big to eat in one bite, but too tough to easily break up.

Will definitely be coming back for the ramen!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience here. Right when we walked in they guy at the counter was super helpful. He explained the menu to us, gave us his suggestions, and gave very detailed descriptions of everything they have. I had the tonkotsu ramen, spicy, and my dining companion had the republic ramen, spicy as well, both with pork. We grabbed our drinks (best iced tea ever!) and found a table. The place was modern, and most importantly very clean. Our orders arrived quickly in gigantic steaming bowls. While my fiances noodles were delicious, I defiantly out ordered him, my tonkotsu broth was heavenly. I loved all the veggies and the noodles were just right. And we both had enough for lunch the next day! 


By the way, Ive been twice now and Ty has been working the counter both times. I hope the rest of the employees are even half as friendly and knowledgeable as he is! Every time I have a question he gives a very informative answer and always seems to be pretty passionate about it too."}
{"text":"Love this place for the vegetarian ramen! Portions are pretty big. This place always has a long line when you get to the counter. I've been disappointed the past 2 times I have gone I have paid for extra zucchini toppings and took my to-go order home only to find the toppings were missing. The only other thing I ever have a problem with is how unprofessionally they answer their phone for to go orders. A simple \"how can I help you?\" would go a long way.."}
{"text":"My husband and I saw this place about a year ago and wanted to try it but since we live in the North Valley its not often we are in the east valley together. We went with some friends and it was ..ok. It wasn't fantastic, the portions on soup were generous, but the Shrimp tempura was 3 pieces for 4.00. It was good though. Maybe I expected too much? For advertising that it was a real ramen place I expected to leave that think to myself I have to go back there!

Good service though. The girl behind the counter was knowledgeable, and the food came out fast and hot.

Certainly better then your pre-packaged 50cent Ramen you get from the store but I am not sure I would decide to spend my money here again when there are so many different places that are yummier."}
{"text":"Stopped on for the first time! Staff was helpful
To tell me what I should get after I told them what I liked. Service was fast we walked in and about three or four groups walked in behind us. Our food came out quick and everyone was very friendly! The food was good I felt like it was super salty I actually dumped some of the broth out and added water to help. I'll be back, but maybe I'll try something different!"}
{"text":"The rating pretty much speaks for itself it was 'A-OK', the flavor was honestly not very different from a package of ramen noodles for a few cents. Although, the sides of corn, spinach, etc are lovely and fresh. Could probably actually just make this at home using the ramen noodles! You get a HUGE amount of food in the bowl, I nowhere near finished. Overall, not a bad place, but nothing spectacular I would recommend either."}
{"text":"Had to try RR as we love ramen and use to frequent a Japanese market/grocery store in Schaumburg Il that served amazing authentic ramen. I have to say we were a bit disappointed with RR. It was just ok for us and based on the reviews I knew it could be hit or miss depending on your experience with true ramen. It wasn't bad however it was not memorable. Like the space it was in, but not a big fan of the ramen. Our search continues."}
{"text":"This is my first taste of Ramen in Arizona and well... The broth wasn't too salty but also wasn't as bold as what I've been  accustomed too back in Southern California. 
The charisu lacked any real flavor and was hidden in behind the taste of the broth.
What threw me off the most was witnessed when I tilted my head up a bit. There was just too much dust up on the AC ducts. Dare I say some spots looked caked with dust, even the fans.. Just imagining all that being blown down into the dinning area almost changed my decision about eating there, but I was too hungry and I had to eat something.
If there's anything I liked, it was the noodles. Firmness was perfect and there was plenty of it."}
{"text":"Honeydew snow was great and so were the gyoza but...........

This is my third time here in 5 years and to call this ramen is simply an injustice to Japanese Culture and Cuisine. Underwhelming noodles, broth that isn't ramen form in anyway, and toppings that ironically remained on the bottom of the bowl throughout the meal - unsavory and untouched. 

It's like if I took a piece of bread, covered it in ketchup, and put a Kraft american single on top and sold it as pizza in Korea. 
(Though knowing Koreans I think its already been done lol)

That said avoid the ramen and this place is actually pretty great! (Cool ambiance and interior as well) Time for a name change?"}
{"text":"Good ramen, the noodles are okay, but the broth is always delicious. Lots of add ins, and lots of choices. I get something a little different every time I go. Staff is very nice and helpful, and the prices aren't too bad. Only wish it were closer to me in Phoenix, but when I go to Tempe, I always make a stop here."}
{"text":"I've always come back to this place when I'm craving a big delicious bowl of soup. Today was a perfect day for just that! 
I haven't been since it was last cool out, but it seems as if they are putting more content into the ramen, so it was quite filling and I didn't need the extra noodles."}
{"text":"Tea was fresh and wonderful and my 1st udon noodles was good I don't have anything to campare them to, so my 1st has to be the best! We slurped them down! I'll try ramen next time!"}
{"text":"Came here on a date! Food was yummy :) the spicy ramen wasn't quite as spicy as I've had before at other places but it is more americanized so there's that. Otherwise was nice and big portion that keeps you full for the day."}
{"text":"Love the vegetarian bowl!

Wish they had one in North Phoenix..."}
{"text":"I do not recommend this restaurant. I ordered pork ramen, and it tasted very salty. If you don't like salty food. This place is not for you. Plus their restroom are very nasty."}
{"text":"Could've used more flavor. The spinach in the broth was too much. Had to add a lot of other spices so it wouldn't taste so bland. Huge serving size for $10"}
{"text":"Two of us ate here on Sunday 4/26/15 ... The food was tasty but one of the dirtiest restaurants I've been in for quite some time.
Men's room absolutely nasty ... toilet oveflowing, I told 2 different employees and neither one did anything about it.
Floors were filthy, you can see into the kitchen and it looked no better than the mens room. The filth has obviously been building up for quite some time.
If I had used the restroom or seen the kitchen before we had gotten our food, I would not have ordered."}
{"text":"Noodles where doughy/under cooked. 
Really dislike their egg topping as it was hard boiled and halved. Hard boiled egg would be ok if it where multiple small slices but if you're going to halve it, it had better be soft boiled so it disperses throughout the broth, not just two large dry solid pieces.
For all I know this is not typical quality. I only visited once. But you know what they say... you never get a second chance to make a first impression.. and the most important thing restaurant needs to get right is consistency. It has to be good every time. 
Unfortunately I live in Tucson and am not willing to travel again to have another mediocre experience. So I'll pass on Republic Ramen.
For comparison I find Ikkyu's Tonkatsu ramen on Orange Grove to be better although a bit less extravagant with their toppings. Sachiko Sushi on Valencia also has a better Sukiyaki ramen.
Oh well, the search for truly great Ramen is still on.
Please message me with suggestions for Ramen in AZ, particularly in Tucson."}
{"text":"Always excited for Vegetarian ramen. If I see it, that's where I'm going, no matter what meal it is. Veggie ramen is sometimes hard to come by, especially in Arizona so this place was a surprise find. 

The ramen was good, but not the best I've had. I like Umami more for their veggie ramen. Next time I'm in Mesa, I will probably come back."}
{"text":"Officially found my new favorite boba spot!! So I think i must of picked the perfect time to come in (5:30) because there were only a few people there and it was still nice and quiet so I could get my boba and curl up in a booth waiting for my ramen. I ended up deciding on the Tonkotsu without meat and adding an egg into it. Over all pretty well done, loved the noodles and veggies combo! Although I do recommend getting the spices they have next to the soft drinks because once I added that it added a lot more flavor and spice! Favorite thing was the strawberry slush boba I got!! Perfect texture to the boba!!"}
{"text":"This was pretty great. We came down from N. Phoenix just to check it out. The menu is pretty simple and great for the vegetarian in your family. I got the house, Republic Ramen, which was a little spicy but flavorful. The pork was thinly cut and I wish it was in a little smaller pieces. Star's vegetarian looked good. She got the tofu of course but only got 4 slices. The waiter made a point to mention that they were pan seared. She would have liked a few more slices after all the add tofu winds up being $.50 a slice. We walked away spending a little under $25 for two entrees an pp. of edamame and a 1 large Kirin. The broth makes a great second day soup with some buttered bread. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a new experience at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I ordered the Shio Ramen and it was delicious! Although it was a tad salty for my taste. But it's a great price for the amount you get of soup. Definitely a unique place!"}
{"text":"100% bar none my favorite place to eat. I eat here 3 times a week! 

Affordable, Filling, Consistant, And awesome service culture!

I get the Vegetarian Ramen w/ Zuchini every time, it's to the point where before k get to the counter they have my order ready for me, they treat me like family here and I bring everyone I know!

If you have not been here you need to come!"}
{"text":"It's been a few months since Republic opened, and there's been A LOT of changes. For one, they addressed my complaints about the separate menus by making it possible to order boba drinks at the ramen counter. They've also changed the way ramen is ordered, and there's more of the veggies/protein than when they started, which was one of my main complaints. 
The menu has also expanded to udon and soba, and there's an extensive sake menu.

Yet the novelty of this place has worn off. 
There's still some elementary problems: The amount of protein/veggies is still not enough compared to the amount of noodles given. Shrimp tempura udon was just 2 pieces of shrimp and 1 onion tempura? I paid $8 for that? Do you realize you can make udon at home for $1, which means you just charged me $3.50 for each fried shrimp? 
The broths are way too salty. I've tried the whole gamut of them, and whenever I leave, I have to run to the nearest water source and drink a gallon of water. A few times I've even experienced the unpleasant film in my mouth left by MSG. I really hope they're not using MSG to flavor the broths, but I'm not sure what other ingredients are capable of leaving that weird aftertaste/film.

And why is it closed on Sundays?!"}
{"text":"It was good. Very clean place, with decent service and okay prices. I had the signature Republic Ramen. It was good, but I added some spice to it. My wife and stepson enjoyed theres more than I did mine. Portions are a good size. 

I don't know, I thought it was good, but not great. There is nothing wrong with the place, but I doubt I will come here very often. Give it a try, by all means, but don't expect something spectacular."}
{"text":"I had the tonkatsu ramen with traditional toppings and it was really good! It was very salty though, but it was still great. You get a lot for your money's worth! I also had milk tea with boba, which was as little watered down for my taste, but I've had worse hahaha I'm actually wanting to try their curry rice and see how that tastes!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times. I usually order the Curry Rice and add chicken, and the sweet sauce that they give you on the side, however I tried the Ramen last time I went. It is delicious and it definitely fills you up, I've had to carry out everytime I order just because it's a healthy amount for me. Service is pretty good and they have some delicious Boba. Restaurant is clean, has open windows so lots of light. Located in Tempe past the busy side of Mill ave, so it's a cool place to just relax and enjoy some good food. Sake Bombs too! :)"}
{"text":"A Deliciously Rare Find! 

I first heard about this place when my classmate Rita mentioned a good ramen place. I came here today with 3 of my classmates (Julie, Angela, and Natalie) and we were definitely pleased with our orders! 

We got:
Ramen Republic
Garlic Chicken 
Boba: Taro, Honey Dew, Black, and Thai

The Ramen Republic was very flavorful! No need to add Siracha! The portions are huge enough that it's easy to split between two people. The Garlic Chicken Ramen was also so tasty! Its not spicy, but you can tell there's a million mouth watering flavors there. 

The boba here redeems my previous thoughts about boba in the area. The balls were freshly made, moist, soft, and the kind that melts in your mouth. The milk tea boba was also well prepared! It didn't have that cheap boba taste that's watered down. It's very rich and just the way I like my boba! 

Alex, the guy that took our orders was very helpful and friendly. We also got nice discount coupons so I will be returning for sure!"}
{"text":"If you want a tastey noodle dish, possibly with boba tea to follow, this is a great new option for North Tempe. I've only been there once so far, but intend on making this place a frequent stop. They've upgraded a bit since some of the earlier reviews and you can now order cafe items from the main restaurant's register.

The service was fast and friendly, the noodles were excellent, the portions were generous (though the meat could be a little MORE generous, given the price of the dish), and the honeydew milk tea was refreshing.

During the meal the chef came out and chatted with our table a bit. Sounds like they'll be adding more types of noodle dishes to the menu shortly. If you're a fan of Asian noodles, this place is definitely worth stopping in at."}
{"text":"For Asian that's a place for American, cause the menu is design for them.... But the food still taste good n the place is clean. If u r looking for American style Asian food try here!"}
{"text":"Called and was put on hold for 10 minutes. I then called back and it was busy as the woman still hadn't got back to the phone to even realize I had hung up. Nice way to treat your customers."}
{"text":"Great, fast service and a nice clean atmosphere for some pretty cheap prices. I generally get their (fancy and tasty!) iced tea and add the garlic and soy-soaked egg to my soups, which makes things closer to 10 bucks a head.

Not all of the broths are for everyone; I like the tonkatsu broth the most and don't really get the chili-oriented broths, but my wife's reasonably fond of those. The sapporo corn broth is really fun. There are lots of condiments for the soup: the togarashi chili powder's generally enough for me, but if you'd like your soup saltier/sesame-er, go for it.

The curry rice is surprisingly excellent, too! It's really hard to justify gettin' that when you're at a ramen house, though.

There's better ramen in the valley, but not with this price or the fun amount of options. The veggies are unique and fresh, and everyone's super friendly. It's a great place to warm your bones when it's cold or rainy outside.

Pro tip: eat most of the spinach before it cooks in your soup if you don't want it to alter your noodles' flavor."}
{"text":"Go to spot beside hotel for week...quick service.. great ramen bowls.. many to choose from.. enjoyed with beef.. liked traditional side...kimchi was delicious not spicy... only complaint was the young college men \"working\" there. On phones.. not getting orders right... seemed just lazy.. and no thank you.  All the ladies were very attentive and on their game.."}
{"text":"I am an avid ramen noodle lover. The options were fantastic. I ordered the Chili Pepper Ramen \"traditional style\" and added an egg and off the menu spicy. Very few restaurants are willing to really make a dish spicy. I typically order this way at Thai restaurants and only 1 out of 5 of my favorite places has produced a dish that needed no extra spice. Republic ramen came through in the spice department. The tofu was not too squishy or soggy - just right and the veggies were not over cooked.  My bf had the Shoyu Ramen - original style - great flavor - no extra spice. We also had the seaweed salad which was also one of the best we've had. The seaweed flavor was not too strong. Finally, we had boba tea's - traditional black tea flavor. They were good, the flavor/consistency was not the best we've had - seemed a bit watered down, but would probably still stop by and grab one if we were in the area."}
{"text":"OMG. Am I glad to have found this place. I absolutely loved the dish that I had. Pork, with ramen and all the vegetables in a pork broth. Truly tastey. This is not a fancy place. Some of the best finds aren't and this was one of them. I'm definitely going back. I do suggest eating there. It's always the experience and the food."}
{"text":"Yahhhh my first time eating ramen = much success, yes!

It'd been on my to-eat list for quite some time since I live within biking distance of the place. It took a good workout though at nearby Phoenix Rock Gym with friends to actually stop and enjoy a fat bowl of ramen afterwards. 
Beware if you want to add anything in addition to what is included in the bowl already - it can end up costing you a pretty penny for lots of extras! 

Our group made quite a line upon arrival which in turn made our bowls take a bit of time to be delivered [oh well]. I went with my friend's suggestion of Tonkotsu Bowl with pork. Many great flavors, but just it seems not a lot of fixins, waaaay too many noodles in the bowl with the soup to be worthy of the cost. Loved the edamame, because you can't go wrong with edamame. Delicious ramen though and I'd probably return to split a bowl + edamame and some boba next time."}
{"text":"This is the second time visiting here and I really like there noodles and for the price you can't go wrong!! It also helps that are two kids are still small enough that we can share a bowl with them and everyone is full. Our first visit we had the Tonkastu Ramen with pork and tofu. However on our second we had the Sapporo ramen and vegetable ramen with chicken and tofu, along with edamame and gyoza. Well definitely be back on our next visit to Az.My only reason for giving a 4 star is because our 2nd visit the customer service was terrible!!! I felt like I was bothering the kids behind the counter with my order. Then when our food arrived it was just placed on the table and that was it. Now on our 1st visit the gentleman was a little bit older but was definitely more energetic and sociable!! He was the one who brought out our food and even came back to check on us and how we liked the noodles. Despite the second visit being very lack luster I will be back because we liked the food and the price."}
{"text":"I'm trying to get a more broad spectrum of reviews up because as of now I've been mostly reviewing my mainstays and places I'm obsessed with so here goes. This place is totally decent. I had their special ramen with beef and it wasn't bad at all. The broth was spicy but good and on a cold night when I was craving soup it  hit the spot. The reason that this place is just 3 stars and I probably won't be returning except for rare occasions is because it really was just ramen. You get a few slices of beef (and there are a few other options) on top but it really wasn't enough in my opinion to justify  the price and also, getting so much broth you would expect a little more beef than you get. Really, its ramen... I could go buy 90 packs in the store for $9 so if I'm going to pay that for one serving please throw in a little more meat.  I do feel like eating in here might be a little better since they give you a huge bowl and the presentation is a little better than taking it home (broth in one bowl, noodles in another, beef on top of noodles cold). I could possibly come back but it would probably be a similar situation as the last time, cold night and in the mood for ramen."}
{"text":"It's salty and good.  Simple menu without a ton of deviation so you don't have much chance of ordering something they're bad at."}
{"text":"Stale vibe / decor , bland food ... Either this place is supes terrible or Clever Koi is seven stars on a five star scale. The \"egg\" was a stained brown color and the yoke was hard boiled , not soft. I actually thought there were sliced mushrooms in my ramen .. Alas, 'twas merely the rubbery brown sliced egg."}
{"text":"The noodles were the best and ginger honey green tea nice a sweetened to perfection. A great place to go on those nights you don't feel like cooking and a good healthy serving filled w fresh veggies. A kid friendly place too"}
{"text":"Scarfed down all my food before I remembered to take a picture!!

I was so excited to see they have Boba here, & Snow Boba at that!! So I got a large mango snow-- absolutely delicious!!

My fiance & I got the Sapporo ramen, I got traditional toppings & he got the original. I actually think the concept is clever, picking your toppings-- like someone else had said, similar to Chipotle but a ramen joint...

You have to know what tastes mesh well together though, & because of the Chipotle-esque atmosphere-- unless you know what your doing, I don't think you should expect a ton of recommendations.

Food came out quickly, as to be expected in this type of atmosphere, & the portion was a good size.

This place was recommended by a friend & I do have to say, it exceeded my expectations. Will be going back, especially for Snow Boba! :)"}
{"text":"Love this place since it's close to ASU campus! The noodles in the ramen they use are so good. I tried their SNO for the first time-- I got taro sno with condensed milk, mini Mochi, and coconut flakes. It was SO good. Definitely try this place out"}
{"text":"A foreword to this review- everyone PLEASE visit Republic Ramen for my own selfish purposes.  I've been waiting forever for quality boba somewhere near me and a legit ramen place.  This is it.  Support them :-)

MENU
Noodles:
The complaint from serious Ramen lovers here is that the menu might be a little limited.  However, it's Arizona, they're doing what they do right, and well, it's Arizona.  With the different varieties of add-ins and their spice/sauce selection, you can pretty much have any kind of delicious ramen you want.   They have 6 standard types of broth and 9 add-ins to mix it up.  They also have 3 combo options with edamame, gyoza, and curry rice.  
Boba: In case you haven't heard, the restaurant is split into a tea care and a noodle house.  The tea cafe has a great selection of boba flavors, tea varieties and a good solid tapica pearl (not overly sweet).  Props to the Taro- it's my favorite I've had so far which includes Chinatowns in New York, San Francisco and Seattle. They also have Snows (basically an awesome slushy) and regular teas.  

DRINKS:
See above for the boba.  The owner said they're trying to get a liquor license and he envisions an alcoholic boba menu in the future. Whaaaat?  Best idea ever.  But, as of now, no booze.  

VALUE: (hey, look! new cateogry to my reviews!)
The ramen is priced exactly how it should be, so long as you save the double helping for the next meal.  Don't throw it!  It's completely comparable to Ramen in bigger cities.  

CLEANLINESS/OVERALL QUALITY
Brand new, spotless.  Great modern design and classy casual feel.  

SERVICE
They were a bit slow for what I ordered in the tea shop but the ramen comes out really quickly.  You can also order ahead for easy takeout.  I've only eaten in-house once so my service knowledge is limited.  Their takeout is 100% dependable, however.  

ATMOSPHERE
Urban casual without compromising atmosphere.  I would even take a date here- quick and funky, full of character, nice people, and definitely empty since this place is new and has trouble keeping a crowd (Again, please support- they're great!)"}
{"text":"This was my first time having ramen other than occasionally tasting other people's when I was out with family in the past. I also had some of the gyoza, seaweed salad, sno and boba. The ramen and the seaweed salad were both good as was the sno, though I doubt I would go out of my way to order it again. The boba was just bad and the gyoza was so salty you couldn't really taste anything else. The couple of people we dealt with at the counter were nice and answered all our questions. I would definitely go back for the ramen but I'd probably stick with just that."}
{"text":"We're lucky to have Republic R+N in the Valley, let alone Tempe. It's an amazing ramen cafe - with six different broths and a dozen different add-ins from which to choose. Plus they just expanded the menu to include other classic fast Japanese favorites - curry, udon combos, etc. The space is beautiful, and the employees - every last one of them - are so friendly and helpful and accommodating. This is such a five star place!!!!

Minor quibbles - extra spicy broth is almost indistinguishable from normal broth, and the curry is not traditional Japanese curry. It's OK, but not what you'd expect. Major quibble - what they charge for protein is simply outrageous. A few sprinklings of chicken, a few slices of pork or beef, a few cubes of tofu = two dollars added on??? An already pricey $7 bowl becomes a $10 bowl including tax because a (very) little protein is added? Unless this is Kobe beef, this is outrageous. Penny wise and pound foolish guys - triple the protein you serve or cut its price in half. The current pricing is crazy.

C'mon guys - you're so five stars, just fix the protein problem! In the meantime, dear reader, this is still a place to relish at any price."}
{"text":"Best ramen I've ever had in Arizona! I normally get the pork broth with chicken & veggies ramen, it's my favorite. I live in Glendale and it's about 30-40min from home at least and it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"I'm not a fair judge of Republic Ramen. 

I have had amazing ramen too many times now and when I go to a shop specializing in ramen, if it's not pretty great, then I can't help but hate it. They have \"tonkotsu ramen\" on the menu too so that alone sets expectations.

I ordered the \"tonkotsu ramen\" and hated it. Broth was weak with no depth of flavor. Noodles had no chew. As much as I hoped to love it, I was completely let down.

To be fair, I don't believe there is any decent tonkotsu ramen in Arizona. 

I just don't see why this shouldn't be a concept that can be executed adequately here. For me, with the ramen I've had and love, it definitely wasn't.

Again, I'm not a fair judge of ramen. I'm mean and nasty about it. It's like sushi or uni. Once you elevate your expectations by having the stellar stuff, the mediocre doesn't cut it anymore. 

And where I can eat American style sushi when I adjust my expectations (happy for crunch rolls and California rolls), can't do it for ramen.

If you're not passionate about ramen though, it's fine to ignore me. If you don't have amazing authentic ramen to hold it up to, it's probably fine."}
{"text":"Great soup at a great price! The noodles are delicious- we came with an international student from Japan and our 3 elementary-aged girls, and they all loved it. A very family-friendly atmosphere and laid-back, you order when you come in and they bring the soup out. We definitely plan to come again!"}
{"text":"Not quite as good as Tohzan, but a solid second choice.  Phx has really been lacking a decent ramen house and this fills the void in the Tempe area. 

I had the shoyu ramen which was excellent and reminded me of the more traditional style I'm used to, but my partner had the Republic ramen which was spicy, delicious and of Korean inffluence. We also had the gyoza which were OK, but I thought they would be better. Next time I would opt out of those and maybe try a different side. There were also kim-chi, fried rice and edamame as other options for sides as well as other toppings for the ramen.

I was very pleased with my first visit and can't wait to go again. I do hope they expand and branch out the menu to some other ramen styles and maybe so other sides. 

Excellent ramen and good work Republic!"}
{"text":"I am happy to hear that a ramen noodle place opened in valley.  I love eating ramen noodles when I was in Cali.  At first driving into the plaza, it bring back the days when I attended ASU.  This location used to be billiard place. It was definitely a college hangout, still is.  The space of the restaurant is huge.  They divided portion of the restaurant with a Boba bar.  I thought it was pretty neat.  I didn't try the Boba drink, but my friend did.  I can't remember what she had, but the drink was too watery and too sweet, according to her.  The menu selection is small.  I had ordered their house ramen, Republic Ramen.  It was supposed to be mild, but of course it came out with a kick.  You get two or three charsiu porks, so call veggies (lot of scallions) lack of spinach, and sprouts.  I think they forgot to put in the sprouts.   The soup base was spicy.  That was it!  The soup was very bland.  Was it worth the $6.95 for a bowl of ramen?  Not really!  Would I go back? Yeah probably so, the restaurant can fit a large crowd; friendly staffs, and good mid location (Tempe)."}
{"text":"This was on a list of restaurants I had to try for Check, Please AZ. I went with a friend and we ordered the pork ramen and had the spicier version. It came with veggies but the protein was a little underwhelming, not the tender pork belly which I am used to but tougher meat like in pho. We also split the seaweed salad. My friend really liked their marigold tea. The place is very college-y and had a cafeteria feel. Next time will try the boba/cafe area. It's alright, not the worst place for asian food but definitely not the best. I believe the draw here is cheap, decent food."}
{"text":"Well, despite having (ugh) tapioca (ugh) that they stick in tea, the Republic is a pretty awesome place.  Now my wife tells me that this is different than Pho but I don't really see how.  It's a bowl of scalding hot soup full of noodles and meat.  Anyways, this stuff is really tasty.  Way better than the cup of noodles you lived off in college.

I tried the Republic which was apparently the spicy one.  It was decently spicy but I still added some of that magic red sauce.  It came with a side of edemame which had been steamed and lightly salted. The workers were all friendly and helpful.  The interior was very nice and made me feel quite welcome.

My only complaint was the price.  I feel like $8 for a bowl of noodles is asking a lot.  Especially in Tempe."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place!  You will love their ramen. My favorite is the Republic Ramen which is spicy but addicting as well. The Miso Ramen is great  if you don't like spicy and the Tonkotsu Ramen is delicious if you like a more sweet milky flavored broth. You can add whatever vegetables and extras you want to. The gyoza is great but I prefer mine steamed and they are able to accommodate that if you request it. The staff couldn't be more friendly. The service is fast. Don't miss out on the Boba tea. I get the Thai milk tea with boba, it is perfect. I am so happy this place exists."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating ramen, turns out soba noodles are not ramen, however, it was still bomb and I really enjoyed the food! It was a lot of food for a good price. Not too salty, fresh spinach with scallions SO GOOD!  I recommend it. I thought the atmosphere was really cool in the evening. I would recommend it for a night out with friends or a first date. Ladies, no lipstick because it will all come off via noodle action haha."}
{"text":"Udon here is absolutely delicious!! My favorite place to go when I want something more light and healthy.

However, the facility and service are a big disappointment every time I come in. The past few times I walked through the door there was a line about 5-10 people deep and no one running the front counter. 10 minutes goes by and still no one... Finally one of the back of house staff pokes their head around the corner and yells for someone to come up from the back to take orders. Unacceptable in my opinion.

At night this place is very dark and dingy feeling. Oh and bring your own spoons since they never seem to have any!!"}
{"text":"After hearing about this from my friends, I was super excited to visit here. 

It's not a sit down restaurant, you walk in and there's a counter right in front of you with a decent-sized menu displayed from behind. Be sure to know your Japanese cuisine terms or you'll have no idea what the noodle toppings are. 

I ordered Tokyo Ramen, which was \"light and spicy\" and had it with beef and the Traditional Toppings. There was one person ahead of me, but our food came out at the same time, it took about ten minutes (not too bad). I wasn't thoroughly impressed, but I finished half of it - the bowl is HUGE by the way. I wouldn't get the beef because if you let it sit in the hot broth, it'll eventually get tougher, but its flavor seeps into the soup. I did have to add some Sriracha sauce to give it an extra kick.

Other than the food, there is also a variety of boba milk tea. I ordered the Thai milk tea, and it was great!

Overall, my experience could have been better, but it wasn't awful. I'll definitely come back sometime and have to try the udon."}
{"text":"It took a few visits to find the ramen I liked best, but they are all good. Very sizable portions, and quick service. Employees are very friendly and I enjoy making regular trips."}
{"text":"Not too pricey way to get a huge meal. I had the tonkotsu noodles and it was a little too salty, but otherwise, the meat was generous and the toppings fresh. One bowl could have easily fed two people, so I definitely had some leftovers!"}
{"text":"I've been here about three times. I was in the mood for soup the other day, and I decided I'd stop by Republic since it's so class to ASU. I'd only ever gotten the shoyu ramen which literally just tastes like soy sauce. This time I decided to go with miso ramen with tofu and original toppings. I asked if I could get another vegetable or more carrots in place of sprouts because I do not like sprouts, and the cashier simply refused both requests. I'm not paying for an extra vegetable after you take one out. How hard is it to put more carrots and not put in any sprouts. It's not as thought the veggies are cooked into the soup. Well I decided I didn't want to spend more on this soup than necessary, so I chose to forego paying extra for the egg. I got my soup shortly after, and I wan't completely satisfied. It has so little veggies in it, and guess what?! There were a little bit of sprouts in it. I pick out as much as I could find and put it on the table, and I ended up crunching on a few I didn't find before. How hard was it to put one ingredient less? Completely refused to give me what I asked for. I'm not in the business of giving my money to places that don't service me to satisfaction, so since that cashier wanted to make a stink about a veggie substitution, I'll find some place else to get my ramen next time."}
{"text":"The ramen here was good! I had the miso ramen \"original\" style, very tasty! And they also have a variety of beers, sake, and soju which was a big plus! Def recommend"}
{"text":"It used to be this was a five star place to eat for me, it just seems I had not reviewed yet. Well, this is my review now. This place is no longer as great as it used to be sadly. Here's my reasoning as to why.

Yesterday we went to eat there in a large group of seven, this has never been an issue and wasn't last night. The issue began when I ordered Miso Ramen to be vegan, something that I have done for the past 2 years that we have been going to this place. Apparently now they put pork in the base, something I was just informed of last night. In addition, it seems that they put pork in all but the vegetarian and Shiso ramen. This was very disappointing not only to me, my family who also has vegetarian members, but also those in my group who cannot eat pork for religious purposes. Their udon dishes all have fish sauce, but that is nothing new. 

The girl taking our order was kind enough to inform us of this, but ended up getting more and more irritated as we were trying to figure out what we could eat and what we wanted to do. We figured out what we could eat, ordered and sat down to wait. The food came and all was going well until my sister, one of the groups vegetarians, discovered meat in her food. She returned the bowl and explained why she needed a new one made. 

The one who made the second bowl was a waitress that I have seen there for the past two years I have been going. She's a little below average height, dark hair, wears glasses and I believe her name is Karina. She's great. Always friendly with amazing customer service. She made up the second bowl and the rest of the night went smooth. That was until the waitress that took our order decided to complain about us, very visibly pointing at our table while she spoke. This girl would not give us her name, but she was short and the few times I have seen her she has worn a messy bun for her hair. She also has a poor attitude it seems. Pity.

Suffice to say we will not be returning after being long time regulars. It is a shame because we really did like this place. Unfortunately we do not appreciate poor customer service and getting sick off of the food because of \"the necessity of pork/meat for flavor\". I thank all the other waiters and waitresses who have been amazing to us over our time eating there. We will no longer be returning, but we hope that they will once more become a happier, more vegetarian friendly place again."}
{"text":"This is my second time eating here and I was not disappointed! I got the tonkatsu ramen with original toppings, spam, and added tofu as well. I think the broth tasted even better this time than the first time! I brought my friend here and she had the same ramen but with chicken, and she couldn't stop saying how good it is and so yummy! She did say the chicken could have tasted better, but republic ramen satisfied her noodle soup craving! 

I also got a thai tea with boba and it was soooo good. I will definitely be back again, no complaints! And to make it even better, the portion was so big I get to have a second serving later!!!"}
{"text":"Wow!  So good.  I came here with Sarah A (aka Dr Sarah) to give it a try before it got too hot out eat soup and I loved it.  I got a simple traditional ramen bowl with tofu and ate up every last drop.  I understand its not authentic ramen but that's fine by me because it still tastes great.  After all, Taco Bell isn't authentic Mexican food and I like them too.  

I'm looking forward to fall just so I can come here and enjoy some more ramen."}
{"text":"I encountered this place when I went to the Phoenix Rock Gym and was excited to try it! I moved here from California not too long ago and was missing the delicious ramen places back home. I got the Republic Ramen and a black milk tea with boba. The people who work there are excellent! Great service, quick, and really friendly. The style is kinda modern with a cool hang out vibe. (not sure if that is a thing but I'm making it one :))

The republic ramen was tasty. It is a little spicy. Comes with 5 or 6 slices of the meat of your choice, fresh spinach, and fresh bean sprouts. I thought the flavor was decent but missing a little something savory about it, but still overall good. I might be a little skewed because I haven't had ramen for a while and was craving it. But, I would definitely go back.

The boba was the highlight for me. The tapioca balls were a perfect balance of chew not old and hard like most of the places around here. The milk tea was a perfect amount of sweet unlike other bobas that make me feel like one sip and I'll go into instant diabetic shock. 

Overall I love this place!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  The Ramen is good,  the service is fast,  the prices are reasonable.  Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Nooodle Soup! Growing up, noodle soup was a staple in my family. From the 15 cent ramen packages, to the upgraded ramen/pho/vermicelli packages you would get at the Asian supermarket, to the real deal: Noodles made from scratch that my Nai Nai (grandma) would make.

Republic Ramen + Noodles really brought that soothing comfort food feel back, but without the guilt of prepackaged, processed, fried ramen. Nope these noodles are made fresh daily (or so the cashier told me with much enthusiasm when I asked him if the noodles were fried like the notorius 15 cent packages). Fresh ingredients of spinach, sprouts, and cute little petal shaped carrots to garnish your hot, steamy bowl. 

The steps are simple: choose your broth, choose your protein, choose your add ins like egg, kimchi, or tofu. This place to me was genius. Noodle soup heaven and healthy to boot.

My favorite was the Tonkotsu ramen. I also tried the Shiro as well, but it was a bit too salty for my taste.

This place was right next door to the condo I rented out for Ironman Arizona. I enjoyed it so much I visited 3 times. Twice for noodle soup and once for the bubble tea. The snow drinks were a fantastic post race reward drink ( I had been eyeing them the week leading to the race). They were as good as I had imagined if not better.

Thanks RR for fueling me up with noodle soup goodness pre and post race!"}
{"text":"It was a rainy Saturday in the streets of Tempe that my husband and I decided a bowl of hot ramen will cheer us up.
I ordered the Udon bowl of soups with tofu.
It was good, but not my favorite.i really wanted to love his place because it's close to home, but unfortunately, it didn't hit a home run with me."}
{"text":"I love this place great ramen my favorite is the republic it's a little spicy but that's what I like about it. It's not to hot or spicy just right. The other ramen are pretty good too!
The environment is really relaxing not to loud or crowded.
I always crave this place and always coming back"}
{"text":"There was a bowl. It had noodles in it. Neither my wife nor I enjoyed said bowl. She did miso ramen with pork, I did the same with beef. Tasted like roast beef boiled in soup. Yum? Place was clean and people were friendly. Most people seemed to enjoy their bowls, so maybe it was just us. We had ramen in Okinawa, so maybe we were expecting too much."}
{"text":"The most awful ramen imaginable! Smelled like a dirty rug...And.. 40 min wait at the table! 
Such a change from 5 years ago! To bad."}
{"text":"They have wonderful food but the noodles come in huge portions, bring your appetites with you"}
{"text":"Good ramen is hard to come by in Phoenix. I heard about this place from one of my coworkers and thought I'd give it a try. I ordered the Republic Ramen, which was pretty decent. Spicy and plenty of stuff in it. The workers were super friendly and I'm excited to try something new next time. I recommend if you like ramen."}
{"text":"The Best Sopporo Ramen in the Valley. Our place for a true ramen fix. The food is always good ns the service is fast. Don't live in the area but always make the drive for great ramen. Almost forgot they have sake and good boba drinks."}
{"text":"Um... Yum! This place was surprisingly good. I have had ramen (real ramen) one other time in Seattle, and I thought it was alright, but this was really good! I got the shio broth, which was good, kind of a standard clear broth, and I added garlic and got chicken in it. The guy at the counter was super helpful, and he helped me pick out what to put in the soup... he didn't even seem (that) annoyed by all of my questions either, so that was nice. I really liked the way they garnished the soup, it had spinach, carrot, sprouts, and green onions. It looked really colorful and added some dimension to the soup. I added some of their spicy seasoning stuff and it was good. The noodles were really tasty, they were just the right texture for ramen, a little chewy. Gotta like that! Also, the chicken surprised me in how good it was! It looked not so great in the bowl, but when I tried it, it was so tender... like infused with the broth and melting in my mouth.... so good. The portion size is huge, I couldn't finish it. I will definitely come back here... if it was good in the summer, I can only imagine it will be great in the winter!"}
{"text":"My co worker talks about this place all the time so we came here for lunch. 

It wasn't too busy during the day. I didn't think the customer service was that great. The girl that rang me up seemed like she didn't really want to be there. No smile or anything. I ordered the tonkatsu ramen with spam and added corn. I also had a taro milk tea with boba. I thought the ramen noodles and broth were good. The downfall for me was I felt like there wasn't a lot of toppings offered. Most places the ramen will come with an egg and some sort of pork. But those were both extra. I'm also used to ordering some sort of krackling or pork belly which they also didn't have. So I felt there wasn't a lot of variety when it came to that. 

The price is reasonable and it's a good portion but I wouldn't say it's the best ramen in town."}
{"text":"I had a craving for ramen noodles, and so I ended up finding this place through Yelp.
My friend and I ordered a Shio ramen bowl with traditional toppings with beef and a shrimp tempura udon bowl with traditional toppings.
My criticism lies primarily with the overall taste of the broths, the beef I got with the shio ramen bowl and the noddles (ramen and udon) in both bowls. 
-The beef was bland with no flavor and tasted like it had been reheated. 
-The noddles in both bowls were still aldente/ slightly hard, and not in a good way. It tasted like both of the noddles were previously frozen and only got 3/4's of the way cooked. 
-The taste of each broth was overall lacking. If you are reading this and you've have Japanese ramen before and/or you have had any asian packet-ramen at home, you know that the noddles should have a deep flavor to them (either from a broth based in pork, beef, chicken, soy sauce, dashi etc and/or msg/ salt etc), and these...did not have any of that.
Overall, my impression from walking out of the place was that I should have spent my money going somewhere else.

Positives:
The portion sizes were good, although again, not worth much in terms of taste.
The environment is cool and inviting."}
{"text":"It's was good can't complain. If your craving ramen it's a good place to go. The place is clean and we got our food right away. The ramen was good not the best I I've had but it was close to it. Will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"This was a really awesome ramen noodle restaurant. I wasn't expecting such a huge bowl! The chili pepper ramen was super good and spicy. I also had a side of the shrimp tempura which was also very tasty. I would recommend picking that up with your ramen bowl."}
{"text":"Excellent Tokyo Ramen! Fresh ingredients and killer broth. I am so glad to h e found a good ramen place in Phoenix. Now I just need them to open one up on the west side. 
I can't wait to bring the wife!"}
{"text":"Came in for an early dinner with my siblings and my boyfriend. It was a nice little restaurant, you order your food and they bring it to your table. The ramen was okay, I'll have to say I've had better with more options. 

But then I remember this is Arizona and we have pretty much nothing when it comes to food like this. 
The guy who took my order was really friendly and very enthusiastic when it came to answering our questions. The only thing missing was screaming \"Irrashaimase!\" when people walked in. Lol. I had ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen and like others have said, the broth was pretty weaksauce when I compared it to Cherryblossom. It felt lacking, but it still had flavor. For some people it might be a little salty but I can see why there are lots of veggies in the soup, balances the flavor out.

My boyfriend had the Republic and he said it was pretty spicy, but his soup was a little lackluster for his tastes. 
My little brother and sister enjoyed their tonkatsu meals but didn't like the mass of vegetables in their way of noodle paradise. Haha.
All in all it was a nice experience. Quite a drive for some ramen though. We didn't wait too long for our boba drinks either. Probably because it wasn't that busy. 

I will be returning. :)"}
{"text":"Very good! We had the Sapporo Ramen and it was very good! They give large portions and its cheap. Their broth is stunning. Next time I would try a different ramen just to get an idea of their different broths but I feel the Sapporo would be my go to! I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place so many times and always wanted to try it. I decided since I had the day off I would try it for lunch. I ordered the republic ramen with traditional toppings and pork. I also had an ice tea. The ice tea was ok I have had better but was still nice. It wasn't very busy nice crowd for a Friday at 2pm. The staff was very helpful in asking questions and making recommendations. One thing to note that it has been very cold in the area and so the restaurant was also very chilly food came out fairly quickly and looked amazing.  Here is the kicker it tasted amazing just the right amount of heat great ramen cooked perfectly. It was exactly what I was looking for. I will definitely be back and like to try their different offerings."}
{"text":"Four of us had Shoyu ramen,  Tonkotsu ramen, Udon and Shrimp Udon. The broth was all very good but on the strong side. Ive had better, but many worse in Tokyo.  I give their food 4 stars. Cleanliness is at 2 stars. Young workers tend not to care about that, i guess.  Ambience - perfect for college kids."}
{"text":"PROS: Cashier was helpful and friendly, service was good, decent boba selection.
CONS: Place is dirty, both ramen & udon taste packaged with some fresh green onions and spinach thrown in for color, green tea tasted like potpourri.  

Will be on the lookout for a more authentic ramen house with better tasting soup for your money."}
{"text":"Food was great and really inexpensive! Pretty close to authentic."}
{"text":"Perhaps I expected too much of \"real\" ramen. Perhaps this place does not have said \"real\" ramen. Or perhaps I just got the wrong flavor, or I'm uncultured in the field of Japanese noodles. Maybe one of these reasons, but from what I tried, I am not a fan.

I either got Shoyu or Shio Ramen, traditional style."}
{"text":"This is a fun place.  It is a great place for a fast, cheap meal.  Is it truly authentic?  It is probably closer to being authentic to many places around the country. Wagamama-like?  Perhaps.  If you know how to order you will do okay here.  A great addition to restaurants in Tempe!"}
{"text":"I come here all the time, I get the Tonkotsu ramen with extra noodles.  The people are friendly, the service is outstanding and the ramen is delicious. I like how they let you add as much spice as you like (I like it VERY spicy).  The whole place has a cool vibe to it--I think since its so close to the university.   Keep in mind I've never been to Japan, also I've never had Las Vegas or Hawaiian ramen, but I really like the dish here.

Go here!  Its one of the few places that I recommend to my friends consistently (other places being Oregano's, Cartel Coffee, 4 Peaks, etc.)"}
{"text":"This is the best Ramen in Phoenix? Next time I'm in town, I'll should stick to burgers, beer, and good 'ol typical American food.

It's my first trip to Phoenix and I don't know where to eat. After running the Rock & Roll half-marathon, I'm driving around STARVING. Looking to somewhere to eat, I pass by Republic Ramen and I think \"Ramen! My favorite!\" And decide to stop in. 

Inside, it's set up like a fast food joint: counter, register, and the menu posted high up behind the cashier. After ordering they bring it out to your table. 

My bowl of today, and the last one ever here, is the Sapporo bowl - butter corn in Miso soup. It arrived and I think, \"Where's the corn?\" - It was sitting at the bottom of the bowl. Presentation is not a priority here. 

My choice of meat was the chicken (which was also hiding) and I went with extra beef. I should've gotten neither. Both were flavorless, I'd even say that they were dry, even after soaking in the broth!

In the end, I've realized there is nothing special about this place but the fact that it must be the town's only ramen to have won that award. 

Call me biased or spoiled, because I come from Los Angeles and we have the BEST ramen: full of amazing flavor and comfortable traditional environments. If you're ever in LA and you crave ramen, add me and scroll through my bookmarks. 

I wouldve given this place a 1, but the people are nice and they show football on the tvs."}
{"text":"The location is great, just right off of ASU's campus. I ordered the Shoyu Ramen with beef and the traditional toppings. The food here is okay, nothing too amazing, but also not that bad.  The menu includes different styled broths, but I wish they had more variety in their menu. Prices are decent for the quality of food that you end up getting. I brought a friend here, and she also ordered the Shoyu Ramen, but they forgot to include her protein! 

Overall, this is a great place to introduce you and your friends to ramen. The service here is fast and friendly, so it's a great lunch stop if you are needing a quick bite and craving some soup and noodles."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a Sunday and I was pleased with the food. I didn't feel that the broth was watered down or lacked flavor and thought it was very good. I ordered the vegetarian with rice noodles as it's the only way to make it vegan. The regular ramen noodles have egg in them, which is sad but to be expected. The rice noodles didn't have much flavor, but again, that's to be expected. The portions here are rather large, which is nice...makes you feel like you're getting a good bang for your buck. My soup came loaded with bean sprouts, spinach, red cabbage, carrots, and tofu. I added some chili oil and some ground chili pepper they have in a little shaker, which gave it a really good flavor, not too salty, which I was afraid of. 

The staff was very nice and helpful...I wish I got the girls name who helped us...but she was awesome! 

The only thing that kind of turned me off about this place was the amount of dust. Looking around I could see about three inches of dust on the fans and on the air vents above. The ceiling is painted black as are the fans, which shows every speck of dust...they really need to bust out a vacuum and take care of that because it's a bit off putting. I know previous reviews have commented about this yet it appears to go unchanged. I would also recommend upgrading the iced tea to be in stainless steel dispensers as the plastic we through ones discolor after awhile and start to look dirty even if they're not. 

I hope they take my comments about the dust seriously because I want to go back here."}
{"text":"The restaurant offers a wide variety of Asian noodle dishes, including udon.  The decor is warm with clean lines.  The food was really good and delivered relatively quickly.  The process  to get the food feels more like a fast food restaurant with ordering done at a counter and the food brought out by a waitstaff with very little follow up once the food is delivered.  It took me a while to flag down someone to get me a \"to go\" bowl when we were ready to leave.  It is definitely a more delicious and healthier option of fast food than the traditional variety.  I will come back next time I am in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Just went to Republic Ramen a few weeks ago and again Saturday, everyone had been raving over the boba and ramen.  It was delicious. Since my friend told me they had added a vegetarian ramen, so  I was excited to go back and had to try it. 
Impressions; Loved the modern decor, felt very urban. The staff was also nice and helpful. Eager to share about the different flavors! 
The Ramen was wonderful. There was a nice amount of vegetables and a lot of tofu. The flavor of the broth was amazing. The noodles were cooked just the way I like them. The boba was fresh and I tried 2 different flavors. I had one with espresso that came recommended by the boba barista for the caffeine kick I needed, it was full of flavors as he said! I truly enjoyed it all and I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Noodle was cook to perfection but the broth was way too blend. Meaning, salty & not flavored with any ramen broth I've ever had. Too much water added to broth. Spam was cut too thin. I think it would have been bettet if less slices & chunks/cube spam was added.
It's so dark, I couldn't really see what I'm eating or what's in it.
4 pieces of Gyoza way way over priced."}
{"text":"I didn't think I would like this place, because I had the idea in my head that paying for ramen at a restaurant was a waste of money. I mean, you can buy a packet of ramen for $0.25 and make it yourself at home and add your own fixings!  BUT I was wrong. it was totally worth it to pay for the ramen here. I loved their \"traditional\" toppings choice, very different than other noodle soups I've tried.  and they give you a LOT of food in one bowl - could easily take home  half for leftovers.

plus, the boba is good and tastes like it was made fresh that day, not hard and old like at some other places.  I'd come here again!"}
{"text":"The ramen is very good here plus you can't beat the price!! I wound up with 3 meals with just one bowl! I did like the flavors but I've had more developed broths before. I absolutely adored the ice tea selections. Service was great, I was by myself but one of the employees was kind enough to bring me a to go container without seeking like it was any inconvenience even though it was a very busy Saturday and there were tables waiting to be cleaned. I can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Mmm, ramen!  The ramen here seems like a healthier fresher version of the stuff you can get in Little Tokyo, Los Angeles, CA!  I wonder if the owner is from California...

Anyways, the ramen here is quite decent!  It has a chewy texture and the broth is full of flavor.  The variety of vegetables makes me feel like I ate something healthy versus eating something super heavy.  I had the miso ramen with spam and gyoza combination and it was amazing.  The gyoza was a dumpling of flavor.

While there's better ramen places out there, I'd probably be back for ramen!"}
{"text":"When I want a big bowl of comfort food and am in the east valley this is one of our favorites. The soups are great. And I don't have to do any work (I'm the cook in our house). Sometimes I just want a hearty bowl of pho or another Asian soup. And this place can kill that craving. And the prices are high but the portions are huge. I do think that some of the side dishes are a bit expensive for the portion size but the soups are great."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food here. I've never tasted anything I don't 100% love. The Tokyo ramen with beef is my go to, but the Shoyu and Tonkotsu ramens are delicious as well. The location is great, and the hours aren't bad. I do kind of wish they were open a bit later, I think they'd do well with all the college kids in town!  My only downside to this place is the service. For the most part, you encounter rude, blank staring college kids who are counting down the minutes until their shifts are over. I've never had the pleasure of being greeted by someone friendly! I return for the food, but the service needs a serious improvement."}
{"text":"I was quite skeptical of Republic Ramen at first--not because of how it looked, smelled, or what I had heard but because why would there be a restaurant charging 8 dollars for what I can make for .14 cents?

Man was I wrong. My friends invited me and when I showed up I was happily surprised by the very clean restaurant. Couples sat in the back eating and drinking sake. The lady at the counter was very friendly and when I asked for an explanation of the menu she was very helpful. 

The menu works something like this: pick your broth (they have 5 or 6), then pick the meat. The vegetables are standard but they do have some extras including kimchi!

And the kimchi was amazing, the perfect amount of spice. And it tasted great when put into the ramen. 

The goyza and tempura were amazing and after finishing them I only wanted more. I got their standard ramen with chicken and while the chicken was a tad dry (overcooked) the taste of the broth and the freshness of the vegetables more then made up for it.

Though I've only been once I plan on going again, to try some of their other broths."}
{"text":"Okay time for me to explain. 
I thought the veggie broth would be flavorful but it was rather bland, I was hoping it wouldn't be too salty and it wasn't but it also was lacklusting in much of the wonderful richeness that veggies can offer to a broth, and I found myself trying to just eat the noodles. Which seemed a little over cooked. But it's a decent price so I guess you get what you pay for, I definitely recommend Umami over Republic, Umami's broth packs a flavorful punch! I tried to like this place I really did, you can see into their kitchen and it looks grimy and dirty and that's always a giant indicator as to how much effort a chef puts into his/food."}
{"text":"Satisfied My Ramen Craving!

I have been wanting to find a good bowl of Miso Ramen, and had checked out a few places that I didn't find satisfying. Republic Ramen is not in my neighborhood, but I decided to take the drive to check it out.

First of all, parking was plentiful, and I found a spot with some shade, which is important when it's 109 degrees out. Walking in, there wasn't much in the way of atmosphere, but they had exactly what I wanted on their menu - Original Miso Ramen, which I ordered as is with pork, bean sprouts, carrots, scallions and spinach. You can order additional ingredients, but I wanted to try it with their original preparation the first time. I also ordered Japanese Curry Rice to go to have later for dinner. You order at the register, and they bring your food to your table. 

My Miso Ramen came out pretty quickly, and they said they would bring my curry out shortly. My dish looked and smelled appetizing, so I dug in. The miso broth was good, and all of the ingredients tasted fresh. I LOVED the ramen noodles. They were cooked to the texture that I like, slightly chewy, and were delicious with the other ingredients. The serving was so large that by the time I finished all of the solids in the bowl, I couldn't finish the miso broth. They were not stingy with anything in the dish. I will go back for the Ramen again!

I didn't taste the Japanese Curry until I got home. It was still warm, but had an overly oily texture that I didn't care for. It was ok reheated later, but I wouldn't try it again.

I can't wait to go back and try some of the other broth flavors for the ramen!"}
{"text":"After the staff was rude at Chompies and we left, we ended up here and I'm soooo glad we did!! 1st off, the 2 young men behind the counter were wonderful! They helped a ramen rookie order and got my little guy a kid friendly portion and were just so polite and cool.  The prices were low and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Great 1st time experience! Got the tempura shrimp soba noodle (added zucchini) w/ a side of kimchi. Delicious. Fast. Clean atmosphere. We'll def be back for more"}
{"text":"I've tried multiple different ramen places and this place is just so bad. I can make better ramen from the cup or package that you can buy at Walmart better. Also who puts carrots and spinach in their ramen?? If your Asian and have tried real authentic ramen this is a definite no. I ordered the basic Tonkotsu ramen and it was sub par at best. For meat I got pork and it tasted like it came from a freezer and then was put in a microwave. The only good was I liked the choice on the type of noodle they used. On a side note, the water also tasted like it was unfiltered. Don't waste your time and especially your money. I'm actually disappointed since this place has descent reviews. I'd tell people to try places for themselves but this is a serious pass."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for good cheap ramen. I was introduced to Republic Ramen some years back and when I go I always get the Republic Ramen, original toppings w/spam. 

Only negative is that they never answer the phone if you want to call in an order. Happens more often than not.

If you're looking for a good bang for your buck ramen shop give this one a shot."}
{"text":"Good decor and ambience. Good prices. Huge portions. Very, very mediocre ramen and broth. Tastes almost like instant noodles. Won't be going back. I guess it's ok if you're a starving student."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and I always love the food. The service, however, is never great. That's the only reason I can't give this place five stars. Tonight, I saw approached an employee to ask for a spoon. She was on her phone and waited until she finished her text before acknowledging me. I work in a restaurant and personal phones should never be in sight of customers. I saw this employee on her phone four times during my one hour visit tonight. If Republic Ramen could get on their staff about customer service and appropriate behavior, this would be five stars for me."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but the service is awful. Usually I call and place a to go order, if I am lucky and get through their ridiculous phone system, AND lucky enough to have someone actually answer I am able to place my order. Picking my order up is always a chore....

When you arrive there is usually a line, the amazing part is that you have to wait through this line even for a to go order. After waiting about fifteen minutes you can pick up your order and get out of there. The system that they use to place orders is inefficient and its ridiculous how long it takes. If you're lucky enough to show up around 6PM then you should be prepared to wait a considerable amount of time to order and get your food. 

If you're a fan of Boba, don't plan on their machine working, ever! I've attempted to order it on several occasions and the machine is always down. I don't know if it is the machine or the employees just being lazy but it's pretty awful. 

If you're not a fan of fish then you should avoid the Republic Ramen as it tastes like fish even though there isn't any in it.

In my opinion the best thing on the menu is the Tokyo Ramen with Beef. If you're able to go during off peak times, aren't craving Boba and good dealing with inefficient service then you should be okay."}
{"text":"this place isn't amazing but you get a huge bowl of ramen and it's decent. I got the republic ramen and it was kinda bland and loaded with green onions and spinach. I had to flavor my broth using the chili oil and spices. My boyfriend got the chili pepper ramen and his broth was pretty flavorful already and then adding the spices and chili oil just made it better. their boba was decent and we would probably come back but I would think pho would be my first pick before this."}
{"text":"Ramen is ok. Meat tastes like it's previously frozen. Boba was pretty plain and the balls weren't soft enough. I was told the Republic Ramen is a 7/10 spicy... I would suggest to order an 11 just to get a mildly hot/spicy flavor. My friend got the beef and it looked ok. Will probably just stick to getting pho in the future."}
{"text":"Meh. I've had better. Not very authentic and the broth was mediocre. I asked for the Tonkatsu spicy and they seasoned it way too spicy. Not to mention the charsiu tasted very old. Still on the hunt for a real ramen noodle house in the valley!  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I'll admit it, I don't know much about the kind of Ramen that doesn't come in a small dehydrated square with a silver seasoning packet, but I really, really liked my food here! 

The price seems a smidge high for what you are ordering, but we did get a crap-load of food for our money!  I ordered the traditional pork ramen and my husband got the spicier version with tofu and we both really liked our food.  Our daughter snacked on a bowl of soybeans and a strawberry icee boba drink and the occasional noodle she swiped from our bowls.  

The place is cute with a slight hipster, college kids vibe, which means my husband and I were wildly out of place with our messy haired toddler and our frazzled thirty-something parent look.  


(Okay, okay...forty-something.  You caught me.)

And being a crotchety old fart, I will also mention the only thing my husband and I didn't care for was the music blaring overhead, but that's okay since I don't suspect we are their primary demographic target, and our 1970's punk music probably won't go over too well with the hipster college set...amiright?  ;-)"}
{"text":"You come here for a ramen fix. It's nothing amazing that you'd want to come regularly. Decent food at a decent price."}
{"text":"It was our first time so I asked the blonde at the counter what was good.  She said she didn't know since she doesn't eat the food. Um. Ok.  

I ended up ordering the miso ramen, which a huge mistake.  It was so salty and just had a really weird taste to it.  I couldn't even finish it.

The husband tried the tonkotsu ramen with beef which he enjoyed. Our friend came late and ordered the same thing but the blonde said, \"we're out of beef.\"  So then my friend said, \"is the chicken or charsiu better then?\"  Her answer, \"That's all we have...is chicken or charsiu left.\"  Um. ok. 

Though my food experience was not the best, my husband enjoyed his, and I'd like to  come back if we're ever on that side of town again to try the tonkotsu or the udon.  I'm willing to give it another try.

But they need a better hostess at the front because she was absolutely clueless."}
{"text":"I really liked this place!  Walking inside to this sleek and beautifully appointed fast/casual restaurant is a stark contrast to the lack-luster strip mall complex that it calls home.  Clean white walls surround the modern chairs and deep benches with dark wood accents.  I love the splash of blue mosaic tiles up front as well.  Whoever designed the interior has a sweet sense of style.

The menu here is really no nonsense.  There's about 4 different types of ramen, an assortment of sides, and then there are multiple variations of Boba in the room adjacent.  I chose the Shoyu Ramen.  The broth was rich and savoury and provided a nice contrast to the simple noodles.  There were a couple large slices of pork in the soup, but I would have preferred more small chunks instead.  I liked that there were lots of bean sprouts in my ramen and it added a satisfying crunch.

I would definitely come here again when I want some Fancy Cup of Noodles without all the preservatives :o)  Don't get confused though, I say Cup of Noodles in loving jest, because really, it's ramen, but this is really good quality stuff.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Meh... poor location. Service not great. You need to understand the way they several before you get to the counter. Not the traditional ramen house with the customary ordering system. Food was ok at best. I'm ramen sad"}
{"text":"Republic Ramen + Noodles 
Looking for a goto Ramen Restaurant in Phoenix, Tempe or Scottsdale. 

This one is not bad but difficult to compare with Los Angeles or San Francisco. 

Good size bowl of Ramen with average amount of condiments added to the bowl.

The Original Broth is good a little on the salty side. To me, one of the most important factors in Ramen is how good the broth soup base is, any restaurant can add as many high end condiments but if the soup base is to hot or not a smooth tasting or appeasing for me, you have automatically lost me.

Ordered the Ramen with original broth with Tonkatsu, like I mentioned the soup base was on the salty side, but not bad, other than that the bowl had had average amount of other items.

Overall I would say it is one of the better Ramen places in town but still searching for that go to Ramen House in town.

In my opinion, this place caters very much to the younger crowd mainly students from nearby ASU, so they will not be as particular as myself"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. Love the ramen. Awesome atmosphere, helps with feeling relaxed. The drinks were on point. I would definitely come here again. I recommend this place to anyone who likes Japanese food."}
{"text":"I love Ramen.  I mean I absolutely love it.  I could eat it everyday of my life if I could.  

This place suits my need for a warm bowl of soup, but as far as it being good Ramen?  Yikes, I would not recommend it over a couple other places with Ramen in the metro Phoenix.  

The dining room is large.  They have many options for your bowl of soup.  BTW, the servings are fairly large.  Give it a try. 

Return Factor: 20%"}
{"text":"I wonder if they use ocean water as broth or salt is on sale. I ordered the miso ramen and the broth was so awfully salty that I couldn't finish. I added 2 pack of sugars and a cup of water but didn't help. They do give a large portion and their beef is pretty decent. Their honeydew boba is good too and the reason I give 2 stars."}
{"text":"Republic Ramen:

Cruised through right before close for take out. (I know it's hated but just got out of class)

Disappointed. 

Curry plus chicken was uninspired, rice was cold.  Thin like sad gravy.  No complexity. 

Chili pepper ramen add chicken: cold noodles,  chicken again tasted and looked like un-seasoned. Breast meat so pretty boring.  

On a budget? There are alternatives.  

The service was good.  Staff,  friendly. 
Resteraunt clean.  

The food (aka my reason for getting out of my car fell far short off expectation.  

Never again."}
{"text":"always have really friendly staff, good food, very fast service, huge bowls of ramen/udon, and some good Thai iced tea (boba)
