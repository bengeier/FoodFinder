{"text":"This place is pretty awesome. Just ordered a pizza and some salads and it was really good. All of it! We would definitely eat here regularly if we weren't just passing through."}
{"text":"In my opinion, pizza always tastes good.  Even when it's not that good, it's still yummy.  I mean what's not to love about a big piece of bread dough covered in your favorite toppings?

But don't fret - you won't be getting mediocre pizza from Capps.  It's crispy, delicious and has the right balance of sauce, cheese and toppings.  They deliver, which is a good thing, since a lot of local places in Willoughby/Willoughby Hills don't.  For a pizza shop, they have a good-sized menu, which includes calzones, wings, salads and the like.  If you're having some friends over (or if you just like pizza), I would recommend ordering a sheet pizza - there's a lot of food for a good price and you can get different toppings on each half.

So next time you're craving a good piece of pizza, check out Capps.  You definitely won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Food was just ok.  Atmosphere is nice. sauce on chicken Parma tasted basically like tomato paste, very strong.  Potato skins was a baked potato sliced with jalapeno cheese sauce and bacon over top, they really weren't very good.  Chicken tender were pretty good, they weren't processed."}
{"text":"Inconsistent quality.   Instead of correcting the mistake made on my order, I was told they would address it in training."}
{"text":"Capps Pizza is a great stop on the go for dinner to pick up or for delivery. They have a big menu and way more than only pizza to choose from. Their burgers are delicious! We've picked up or had Capps delivered for years now. It's a rarity when a big family can all agree on something, bonus! The Capps Pizza on Route 322 has been our steady go to for pizza pick up and/or delivery source for years now. 

They have a great deal for a sheet pizza with 1 topping on Saturday and Sunday's for 19.99 for their weekend special. It's well worth it if you have company coming over to add in addition to whatever else is being prepared... Kids never turn down pizza haha! 

We're also a big fan of their wings. Wednesday is .65 Wing Night. I can't pick a favorite from the wing selection. The garlic cheese bombs are a must try, my son loves the honey mustard wings, or my husband always goes for the hot wings. They're great choices, I've tried them all. Again, a nice menu selection and friendly customer service that has kept us loyal with our patronage for years. Kudos Capps!"}
{"text":"Let's start with the pizza, it's not bad but it's not the best I've had. The sauce is too sweet for my taste and the crust is a bit doughy. Now the burgers on the other hand are absolutely fantastic. One of the best burgers I've had around. The meat is full of flavor and cooked perfectly. The options are amazing and creative. They should drop the pizza and just be a burger joint!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed their pizza for the first time. I had it delivered. I got the veggie pizza which had everything but the girl on it. I'm usually not a fan of mild yellow pepper rings, but it worked nicely with the garlic white sauce on the pie. The dough was good, not too sweet. 

I also ordered a \"Bomb Burger\" which was layered in cheese and wrapped in a deep fried dough burrito sorta thing. Really tasty and interesting. The Elephant Balls were good, too.  Little balls of cinnamon and sugar dough. Pretty good. 

I'm just stoked that they even deliver to my area. Delivery arrived in less than an hour. Friendly service. I'll order from them again and hopefully make it over to their restaurant some day."}
{"text":"My of my favorite restaurants! We love Capps!!! Whether it's for lunch, dinner, or we're having people over we always order from Capps!!! We recently used them for catering services for a larger party we were having and like always it was fantastic! Reasonably priced and lots of food! Always feel welcomed when eating in!"}
{"text":"Oooooo. So good. It tickled my taste buds. We eat here when hungry after a long day of cutting down trees. This year my pop picked the prickly little bugger. But as I was saying previously... my dad loves to bring us here and me and my mom and my sister just LOVE it too. Mmm Cajun fries. Mmm sandwiches. Mmm salad. Mmm water with ice. Definitely a winter hot spot wonderland."}
{"text":"Pizza sucks. Crust always state like stale sweet bread. It's gross
Sauce is filled with sugar. 
Wings always slimy
Customer service soooooo awful. They should not be in business. When THEY screw up your order, they YELL at you. It's unreal!
Garlic balls ok."}
{"text":"Called and ordered a pizza at 7pm and it still isn't here. When I called after an hour the guy said that the pizza would be there in 10 mins and went on to explain to me how short staffed he was and how it's the busiest Tuesday he's ever had. He said he's short two employees and only has one driver. I said okay. It's now 845pm and I still don't have my food. I called back and he said oh yes i would be mad too and that he couldn't offer me an incentive for the delay. The pizza finally came at 850pm and driver is not getting a tip. Sorry won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Capps came out of nowhere.  I headed over there to grab some pizza to take home yesterday and the order was fast, accurate, and delicious.  Unfortunately the pizza was cold after I went bar hopping around the area but gonna have some for lunch later today.  It's nice to know that there's a great pizza place right around the corner from my house.  Very solid 3 stars."}
{"text":"Just ordered Philly steak pizza and wings. Asked for extra crispy wings with sauce on the side. The pizza was delicious, generous toppings, wings were exactly as ordered and delicious as well. My new go-to take out place!"}
{"text":"Not sure why the few reviews they have are really old and not good. Decent take out pizza at decent prices."}
{"text":"Already know my review here this food is amazing. Been to a few different capps and the food is good the service is good and the establishment is clean. I like the huge menu the burgers are really good. Come and try there food it's the best."}
