{"text":"Love the house chicken and chicken fried rice. Only ate here once a few years ago, they were super nice and food was yummy! 

This is out take out spot though.  Dumplings are also good. Family fave is the chicken fried rice, mouth's watering just thinking about it. One serving is good for 3-4.

Delicious food, generous servings, friendly staff and reasonable prices, need I say more?"}
{"text":"Ordered a beef dish and lo mein.   Both marginal flavor. Large portions, but no option to get a half order. FYI Yelp menu pricing is way off on this expect to pay 30% more than what is listed"}
{"text":"I have been going here for 13 years and the food is awesome. Kung pao general chicken is good and this restaurant is a deliciously inexpensive place to eat. Also they have real Asians working there too!"}
{"text":"Great Food, Great Service, Wonderful Prices! YUM,YUM,YUM. Have been eating here for over 30 Years Highly Recommend!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming here for the lunch specials. My two favorites are the house special chicken, and the twice cooked chicken, very tasty. This spot might be overlooked but I am glad I gave Little Peking a chance. I have been coming back frequently for the great food."}
{"text":"I love this place..... cheap quality chinese food... everything i've had there is good. When they label an item as spicy, it is actually spicy! 


There lunch specials are an awesome deal. 5 or 6 bucks for a plate of food, soup and fried wonton chips.

love it!"}
{"text":"Yum! My husband picked this up for  dinner tonight, so I didn't see the place on the inside.  But the food was fantastic.  Chicken Lo Mein, wonderful with fresh vegetables.  Vegetable fried rice was also full of fresh vegetables, broccoli, snap peas, yum!  My husband loved the Kung Pao Chicken, his favorite dish.  But the best was the spicy shrimp, absolutely divine!  The best chinese food I have had in a long time."}
{"text":"The food is excellent. Every dish tastes how it is supposed to taste. The food is fresh and well-prepared. The restaurant itself is old and depressing. Sometimes it takes them a while to notice you are there. But it's worth sacrificing these luxuries for the food. Get takeout, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"One of the best chinese restaraunts in Phoenix. Ive been coming here since I was a little kid and it has always been consistenly great :) Ive never been disappointed."}
{"text":"My family and I have been eating here for at least the last decade. We always order the \"house special dinner.\" This includes soup, egg rolls, chicken wings and several entrees depending on the size of your group. I can't speak for the other dishes but the ones we get with this are always superb. The restaurant doesn't look like much from the outside but I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese food in the valley! I may be a little bias because I've been coming here for almost 9 years, it's right next to my barbershop as well. The sun devil chicken is my favorite dish hands down. I love spicy! So delicious chicken soaked in jalapenos and various other flavors. I could eat it everyday for the rest of my life. I'm also a huge fan of the Mongolian beef, but you really can't go wrong with any dish at this place. Sometimes it's nice to go in and grab a table or sit at the bar. Very quiet nice atmosphere. The staff will remember you if you go in frequently! Great people, great food, great service."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years, love this place. Generals beef is awesome! Twice cooked pork is real good too. Everything I've tried is super yummy. Must try the generals beef though, it's soooo crispy."}
{"text":"The house chicken is so good and it comes with a side of white rice. Me and my be get the dinner plate and it's enough for both of us plus leftovers. Booths are pretty cool too. Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Tried to pick up an order of  teriyaki chicken and they don't even have that on the menu what a joke"}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Chinese restaurant like this in forever...they have a pupu platter and family dinners for 2 or more people. The food was great, service was great, and we will be back!"}
{"text":"My all time favorite place to dine. The food is always top notch and the service is never less than exquisite."}
{"text":"I can't speak to the whole menu, but I will often judge a restaurant by whether or not I find a dish that I crave and just simply have to buy every so often. For me, that dish exists here. It is the Sundevil Chicken. I have literally been buying it periodically for over 10 years and still love it. I highly encourage you check it out!"}
{"text":"Great Chinese food for a great price. Didn't give five stars only because it isn't the best Chinese food I've ever had. I always order takeout as it is super fast. Never have had to wait longer than 30 min."}
{"text":"We stopped by here for some lunch after some running around next door (Imagination Avenue), it was fairly busy so that must be a good sign since it was a Tuesday afternoon. We had the almond chicken (came with egg soup, egg roll & *fried* rice), for $6.00, it wasn't bad, but it is your typical run-of-the-mill, Americanized, plain Chinese restaurant.

They said it came with fried rice, but it looks nothing like fried rice. It just looked like steamed brown rice. There wasn't that much flavor or anything  memorable about the food, but it is very very well priced."}
{"text":"The moo shu pork was perfect. The Happy Family entree had my husband eating the entire order himself before anything else. I had the beef lo me in and that was a bit oily, but it was sesame oil so hard to nick then on that. Service was great with friendly staff."}
{"text":"Today is a sad day ... My absolute favorite Chinese restaurant is closing ... .. I have been coming here for the last 16 years .. Ordered the same thing for all that time .. THE BEST .. BEEF n BROCCOLI .. THE BEST .. SIZZLING RICE SOUP .. w/ $2 extra rice .. So many memories of birthdays and Christmas dinner for us Jews .. . I truly hope they open a new place cause I'll drive to it no matter where it is .. 

 My last Little Peking meal .. I'll never forget"}
{"text":"As an east coaster looking for an equal to Chinese food back in Boston this place is the best I've found so far. 
The service is slow and awkward but the food is good. The sauce that comes on the BBQ pork is out of this world. If you're an east coaster searching for duck sauce this is a great substitute. 
I'd give 5 stars but it's not Boston Chinese food."}
{"text":"It's our neighborhood 'place', and always good....and the service has improved greatly recently....LOVE their Wor Wonton, which is always great for 'comfort food'!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is in our neighborhood. Good food and I pretty sure it is MSG free. I usually get ill after eating MSG laced foods, but not a prob here. The food is good. I love the veggie fried rice."}
{"text":"It's pretty mediocre Chinese, borderline not good. Would go back for the dumplings though! Don't speak great English; I love that!"}
{"text":"I was in the area and hungry for Chibese. This place looked a little basic on the outside so I read some yelp reviews which were pretty good. Excellent orange chicken , plus delicious meat dumplings, plus good service. Pretty fair prices too. Glad I stopped here."}
{"text":"The 1970's were a great time, Disco was king, bell bottoms were the pinnacle of fashion and Little Peking had a cutting edge interior design.  Not it just seems retro chic minus the chik.

The menu is full of authentic american Chinese dishes with thick sauces and mild spices. We had the black tree mushrooms with bamboo shoots and snow peas, spicy bean curd, and egg foo young.   All of which were decent cooked well and drowned in thick sauces. The flavors were mild and offensive. This is the Chinese food that grandma remembers. 

Service was a bit off but it was the 25th of Dec they were busy and I imagine their A crew had the day off."}
{"text":"Big bummer since we live nearby. The food is pretty good, BUT, it was lukewarm. I really wanted to microwave it. We had 6 entrees, so maybe that was part of it? The orange chicken was tasty but barely any spice (and it had an asterisk warning). I was  so glad that the chicken was well cut so it didn't have any fatty parts or grossness. Staff is friendly, place is clean. I'll try the food again."}
{"text":"Decent food, quick service.  I would eat here again, but it would not be something that i would crave. If I am at home and want to have Chinese delivered, I would order again."}
{"text":"Exceptional Chinese restaurant because they will listen, accomodate and remember your needs. I've seen them serve Spicy dishes with no spice, take sugar and salt out of their dishes, remove and substitute vegetables, change sauces, and more to accomodate various people I have brought here. Superb Wor Wonton and Hot & Sour soup, also highly recommend the Mongolian Beef, Sauteed Three Seas, Moo Shu whatever, Bell Pepper Steak and any Lo Mein."}
{"text":"On a very rainy Saturday, and took 2 out of 3 kids to lunch here.  

This is an ol'fashioned type of Chinese restaurant.  Those of you who grew up with the 60's and 70's variety of dine-in location can envision the interior.  Somewhat ornate, lots of red, banquette style seating, Chinese Horoscope paper placements.

It's very clean, and the staff is über friendly.  They were fast with a pot of hot tea, and brought our soups out before we ordered.  Yet there was no rushed feeling, just the sense that they wanted us to be happy.  Nice!

There is nothing nouveau about the food,  just good standard fare. 

 I had almond chicken which was as familiar as you can remember or imagine, one daughter had sweet-n-sour pork, which was a good balance of meat chunks and veggies/pineapple.  The other had House Special chicken, very crunchy and appetizing.

We found the sweet/sour sauce VERY sweet, almost too sweet, but maybe that's because we don't use lots of sweet condiments(?).  Or maybe it was just prepared too sweet.

Food was served nice and hot, and we all enjoyed it, even the one kid who was resistant to trying this new place.  We all agree that we will be back for more.  

Prices are great- about $6 each for lunch which includes soup. wonton and eggroll as well as entree."}
{"text":"Little Peking is a terrific little mom-and-pop Chinese restaurant. The decor reminds me of family restaurants that were popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It's definitely outdated, yet comfortable and appropriate for families, at the same time. The service was quick and as friendly as it could be considering the language barrier. The lunch plates are filled with more than ample portions and include an egg drop soup appetizer and fried won tons. My friend's vegetable plate was good and my house chicken special was moist and flavorful. We both enjoyed the rice but the egg rolls had an odd tasting spice that neither of us could identify. The price was right, for sure!  Lunch for two was just under $12 (plus tax and tip.)  I will definitely consider visiting Little Peking again in the future. I love that it's a locally owned business and my dollars are going to help support a local family."}
{"text":"I've ordered takeout here a few times and they've been very kind! The food is good (it's Chinese food...) and the people are very accommodating.

I forgot to order no mushrooms in a dish and when I got there they made a fresh one for me with no fuss and took the other one back.

Super nice!"}
{"text":"Attentive server.
I had seen this place for years but never felt compelled to eat here. I thin the building used to be pink and may have looked a little questionable... We decided to try it one day we were craving Chinese food. To out surprise the shopping center was remodeled and looked more inviting. The service was great, very attentive. We enjoyed the food. I had the hot and sour soup and hubby had spicy szechuan chicken.
Our server suggested for me to add rice to the soup, which is something I like to do with other soups but it never occurred to me to add rice to a hot and sour soup. : )                           I appreciated the recommendations."}
{"text":"Great service, food is consistently good and prices are right.  The best Hot & Sour Soup, House Special Chicken and Shrimp Egg Foo Yung.  Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to little peking over ten years.This place has the most delicious Chinese food. To be honest I'm yet to find a dish I have disliked. Staff is very friendly don't be discouraged if you walk in and it looks a little ruff on the edges. Promise this place will not let you down."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great sizzling rice soup and our \"go to\" take out place. Great for a cold night. Restaurant looks pretty tired but the food is good!"}
{"text":"Very good food. A lot of stuff comes with rice. If you order let's say the house chicken(which comes with white rice) and also some friend rice, they will charge you full price for House Chicken and Full Price for your fried rice and won't give you the white rice unless you ask when you leave or mention it. They will not mention it and try to save the $ on keeping food you think they don't know you were inclined to in the first place. Good food only goes so far...shady business of shady business. Minus 3 stars for being sketchy.

Also, I have gone there and the doors were LOCKED SHUT during business hours! But yet they let the little Asian man in who knocked on the front door. Seems like they let in friends and family and close early whenever they choose. I showed up 39 minutes before close time and the doors were shit. Wtf?"}
{"text":"Had this last night for dinner. It was pretty good! The rice was nice and fluffy unlike some places you get slightly hard rice from it being overcooked or old. I live right next door so I look forward to becoming a repeat customer. Only thing is that no one delivers around here!"}
{"text":"This place used to be one of my favorite lunch spots when I lived in the area. Last night, a friend and I decided to revisit Little Peking for dinner. 

Unfortunately, it might have been an off night. 

The garlic chicken was lackluster (and a bit chewy) and her shrimp in lobster sauce was overcooked. The Wonton Soup is all of the wonton ingredients dumped into broth, rather than the delightful packets of fun I've come to expect when I order this. It seemed a bit half-hearted.

Service was minimal, but it was polite. Prices at dinner are about $9-$14 a dish."}
{"text":"We just moved into the area and had to try the local Chinese dive. The interior is awful and the restaurant smells absolutely horrible and I don't understand why.  We've had takeout twice and the food is pretty good. The first time we got take out they didn't answer the phone and then it rang busy for 15 min so I popped in to order and had a glass of wine (they serve Merlot ONLY). Here's what we've had so far:

Beef with broccoli - A
Mu shu chicken - D (waaaaaaaaay to much cabbage, and they roll them for you for take out)
Hot and sour soup - A
Crab puffs - B

I will never eat in because it smells so bad in there, but I've found enough good stuff to keep trying more of the menu for take out."}
{"text":"Delicious, been coming here for years with my family (we get our Chinese take out from here). The owners are really nice and friendly, and since we've been coming here for so long, they know us now and treat us like friends. Probably one of the better Chinese eatery in Phoenix. I usually get the chicken with mushroom, sweet and sour soup and their lo mein. They have both \"American\" Chinese dishes and some traditional dishes as well. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I strongly suggest DO NOT Eat at this place. If I can give it -0 stars I would. This is the worst Chinese restaurant I have ever ordered from. I received my order and there are only 3 crepes when they said 4 on their menu. They also over charged me by 20.00. When i called them to let them know they overcharged me they said no each one of their entrees are $10 however the menu on yelp states $7.95. She said yelp messed up. I told her that is not my fault it's wrong and they should honor the price she then yelled at me saying she will not refund the difference. I also told her I received only 3 crepes not 4 she argued with me telling me I don't know how to count and she counted 4 when she packed my food. After arguing for 10 minutes and getting no where. She eventually said for me to get my money back I have to bring all the food back to the restaurant. Even thou I was Hungary at the time when I received the food I lost my appetite after the nasty customer service I received and the disgusting smell of their food. I did bring all the food back to them. The nasty lady on crutches threw the food away in the trash in front of me. Which was fine with me she credit me back my money and threw me my return receipt. I asked her \"are we done here?\" Her reply \"was what do you think!\" Worst customer service again. I HATE THIS PLACE!! I will be sure to tell my friends and family never go there!!! IT IS A HORRIBLE RESTAURANT! The interior is also out dated!! And smell like dirty mold!!"}
{"text":"Little Peking is ALWAYS good. On point with everything that you order. Id highly recommend the Orange beef as it is my favorite and I have to get it every time. And as always have an order of Crab Puffs for an appetizer!"}
{"text":"I really love this place! The food is excellent and the service is super friendly. By far the best Moo Shu Pork I've ever had. The interior is dated, like stepping into a time machine, but I go there for the food and service, not the ambience of the place. I also feel comforted by the \"A\" health inspection rating they have posted near the register because I have certainly been in my fair share of shady Asian restaurants. If you want great American-style Chinese food, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"This is just a great local restaurant. Been going here for almost 20 years and have never been disappointed.  Lunches are the best deal in NE Phoenix."}
{"text":"I really don't know how this place has such great reviews. I walked in on Friday night to order takeout. I waited at the bar/counter area for about 10 minutes with maybe 5 other people all waiting to order take out or pick up. It seemed very chaotic for the one woman behind the counter taking orders, fetching them, and ringing them out. It looked like she was even serving on the floor at times. The food took about 20-25 minutes once my order was placed. Prices were okay, but the food wasn't anything to write home about. I got Hot & Sour Soup (nice and spicy) and Mongolian Beef (a weird light brown color...).

As for ambiance, it definitely has that feel of chinese restaurants from the 90's."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. My first time eating here. Ordered the beef dumplings & Mongolian beef. I've never had dumplings as great as this place."}
{"text":"Went to Little Peking to ask some questions while I was ordering. I ordered the Orange Chicken that came with a side of white rice and the Sampler Plate that had two wings, 2 won tons, 2 fried shrimp and 2 chicken egg rolls. I thought the total was a little pricy just for one person. Then I got home could only eat half of what I ordered. The food was great."}
{"text":"We love the dumplings, Mu Shu, General Tso's nd Yui Shan Spicy Chicken. Fresh veggies, tender meat and no-so-mushy dumplings!"}
{"text":"Sorry guys, but 3.5 hours spent waiting for food that was borderline mediocre simply isn't acceptable. I realize it was Christmas and you were obviously overwhelmed, but our first experience there did not leave a good impression at all. I simply hope we caught you on a bad night."}
{"text":"They have all the typical chinese/American dishes.  Great service.  It's my go to when I have a craving for chinese food.  Love the generals beef, house lo mien, house special chicken and my son loves the Mongolian beef.  Staff is really friendly, as well."}
{"text":"Thought I'd try this place while on this side of town and man do I regret it! Reviews were OK...but those people must not have taste buds! Old meat, canned ingredients, expensive, and the server hovered the entire time and snatched the tip before we could even finish getting up."}
{"text":"My husband and I got take-out from this place last night. We just bought a house in the area and wanted something quick and easy. I used to live in this neighborhood about 7 years ago and I always loved this place. I'm happy to report it hasn't changed a bit. My favorite take-out Chinese spot! I give it four instead of five stars because the interior of the restaurant is dated and doesn't have much in the way of ambiance so we do take out instead. Service is exactly what I expect from a Chinese restaurant. I love the sesame chicken and you have to try the crab puffs. The best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Great food- It looks a little sketchy from the outside but the meal I had was really good. Everything was fresh and hot."}
{"text":"I have moved back into the area and their orange chicken and Mongolian beef were amazing ."}
{"text":"Food is horrible hear! Saw a rat running down there nasty carpet. This food is gross and servers suck. Water is not filtered and gross"}
{"text":"This was our first visit and we will be back. The orange chicken was fresh and orange vest was perfect! The lunch prices are great, my fiancé and I both ate lunch entrees for $14."}
{"text":"I love this hole in the wall place!!!!!!! Their sizzling rice soup is amazing! But be sure to get $2 extra rice with it."}
{"text":"Excellent food especially the kung pao! Got suckered into paying for white rice as they don't have brown rice but the veggie fried rice is awesome! Wife wasn't impressed with orange chicken as it wasn't as fluffy as wok express. Overall I will be back to get my pau on!!!!"}
{"text":"Little Peking has been closed for 9 months and it is very sorely missed. In that 9 months, we have tried numerous other Chinese restaurants in an attempt to find a new \"home.\"  Some offer decor better than Little Peking but none have come close to the taste and quality of the food they offered. 
Just wanted to offer this as a tribute to all that they gave us through the years they were in business"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and drive 1/4 mi down 32nd and go eat at Sala Thai, you'll thank me. 

So the story starts about a year ago I ordered takeout. It was over cooked, dry and barely edible. Pretty much threw it out. That was my first experience, should have learned my lesson.

So I gave it a second chance this New Years 2014. I figured they will be busy, so a good chance the food will be fresh and hot. So I called, ordered my food and the woman on the phone said 45min, then before I hung up said better make that an hour. I had no problem with that, it was New Years. So I showed up pretty much an hour after I called. As I entered I noticed no one was at the counter, so I waited a few minutes. A woman comes out from the back with a cart to clear and clean tables. Walks to the table right next to me and just looks at me and smiles and goes about clearing the table. Mind you, no one was waiting for a table. About halfway thru clearing the table she asks me if I'm here to pick up food, i said yes. She said OK, and went back to clearing and cleaning the table. She finishes the 1 table, and then proceeds to go clear and clean a second table, still no one waiting for a table. 

She finishes the second table and pushes the cart full of dishes to the back, talks to some other waitress and then pushes the cart back into the kitchen and disappears. So I've been standing at the counter for close to 15min at this point. By the way, the restaurant had maybe 7 tables with people. Not slammed, and still no one waiting for a table.

Now there are 4 people waiting for take out, finally they start paying attention to us. I finally get my food, 1h 25m after I ordered.

I head back to the house(1mi away) and we sit down to eat. We ordered Generals Chicken, Mu Shu Pork, pot stickers.

The chicken was dry, with very little sauce. Basically didn't eat it.

The Mu Shu was greasy, lacked flavor. Ate about half of it.

The dumplings are clearly pre-made, so they are greasy, the dough is undercooked, and meat is unrecognizable paste. Ate about half of the order.

I believe based on some of the reviews this place may have had good food, but the owners are older and have lost the drive to make great food. They are clearly buying pre-made food and just reheating it, or cooking it. You can tell they don't really make anything fresh any longer. 

I will NEVER eat here again, and will tell anyone who will listen to avoid this restaurant at all costs."}
{"text":"My family has been dining at Little Peking for years. It's not much to look at - a bit of a hole in the wall, but the food is delicious! Not to mention very well priced. Lunch specials come with a cup of soup, an egg roll, rice, and a generous serving of the entrée. Take out is great as well. If you're ok with a little less ambiance I would recommend."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch here yesterday.  I ordered the House Special chicken.  The egg drop soup was gross ( I am not a fan of that stuff anyway though, everyone else there was eating theirs and seemed to like it), but they give you the little wonton strips with it and some sweet and sour sauce for dipping so that was a plus.  The House Special chicken was dark meat that is breaded and then sliced and served with the thin soy/garlic sauce.  Even though it was breaded then sliced (not my preference), I found myself really enjoying the chicken.  The egg roll was ok, nothing to write home about.  The fried rice was kind of a joke - no veggies in it, just some sad-looking egg.  The House Special was good enough to make me come back for it though."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. Nothing fancy about the dining room, but it was clean and the service was prompt and friendly.  Daughter had chicken fried rice and I had the kung pao chicken and shrimp. Very tasty, nice big shrimp, for a lunch portion, and not to much oil used in the prep. Very good flavor. No upcharge for white meat in either of our meals. The only thing I'd say was a wee bit of a disappointment, the fried rice didnt have the usual peas and carrots. Some maybe would like that, we would have preferred them to be included.

Overall a good meal and a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and was very happy with service and food was good! Stop by for lunch if you are in the area"}
{"text":"I love small hole-in-the-wall family restaurants, and this is one of those gems. Wonderful old restaurant with good food and the staff was delightful."}
{"text":"I had lunch there today.  The food was WONDERFUL!  I ordered the shrimp with vegetables in garlic sauce.  The shrimp were very large and lots of them!  The food is very cheap.  This is my new favorite Chinese restaurant!"}
{"text":"They have the best orange chicken in the area!  Huge portion size, white meat chicken with light breading. I ordered it 'extra spicy' and it had a nice little kick to it. Just a little. That's all I've eaten  here so far...but will be back to try more dishes..."}
{"text":"Charles Ng the owner was real nice, we ordered the Orange Chicken Lunch Plate and the House Special Chicken Lunch Plate. We were going to order ala carte and eat family style, but Charles told us the lunch specials were the better bargin and he would customize the lunch plates for us.

Charles gave us both white rice and fried rice along with the normal egg drop soup, and fried won ton and egg roll.

The dining area is a little out dated, but who cares if it is clean and the food is good, there must be a reason why this restaurant has been open for 15+ years.

Would like to come back to order dinner family style to get a true opinion, but the lunch plates were actually pretty good. 

The House Chicken had a good crunch to the batter with a tasty sauce to accompany the entree. The Orange Chicken was also prepared well.

Look forward to trying more."}
