{"text":"The BF was craving fish and chips, so I Yelped for somewhere nearby and found Joey's Urban. A 5 minute drive later and we end up in the Braeside strip all at this joint. I must say, I was surprised, since my thoughts immediately go to the Joey's that used to be in Southcentre Mall and I associated with over fried food served by pimply teens. This location is quite nice inside. I assume the owner was the one who took our order. He was super friendly and helpful. The food came out and I found them to be massive portions. I had the fish tacos. They were great. Lightly battered fish with a spicy aioli and a fresh salsa on top. My BF had the two piece cod meal with pouting on the side. All together it was under $14 for each of us. He said it definitely was the same quality as Halibut House on Edmonton Trail. They even have flat screen TVs playing sports to keep you entertained which is nice for a eat in fast food restaurant All in all this place is a great upgrade to the old Joey's Seafood, with better options and really good prices and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The vicious fish tacos are my favorite, always filling, and the staff are very friendly and efficient.  A very clean restaurant as well!"}
{"text":"I braved an hour of driving in rush hour traffic to get here. I had eaten at the Market mall location and was so impressed that I wanted to recreate the tongue-exploding experience.

Location is kid friendly

Service was quick and the person taking my order was quite nice. Ordered kids meal fish & chips and the coconut shrimp for myself. 

I'm really sad that the food did not wow me. I had such high hopes but... It felt almost like it wasn't well spiced and was fried in used oil. 

All in all, it was ok but not worth the madness that is Macleod trail at 5PM on a weeknight"}
{"text":"Great place with excellent fish tacos, poutine, and of course, fish and chips. Have had remarkably good service every time."}
{"text":"We made a point to go out of our way to try this place based on some reviews I had seen and the fact that I love a good poutine. It was worth the drive for sure.

We were having a late lunch so we opted to get 2 poutines (Mexican and Butter Chicken). Man got  2 beef tacos and child got calamari. We all tried a bit of everything except the man would not share his tacos once he had a bite...I take it they were that good? They certainly looked amazing with plenty of filling to them. He said they reminded him of tacos we had on a trip to Austin TX, hence he was not sharing!

The poutines were great. I enjoyed the Mexican one more than the butter chicken. I think in my head shredded beef, sour cream and other Mexican toppings make more sense on fries than butter chicken does. Don't get me wrong, the butter chicken was okay, but didn't dazzle me. Prices were decent, and seemed even more reasonable once I saw the quality of food we got (and portions!)

The calamari was good...breaded, slightly spicy and crispy. There was a little too much batter to calamari for my liking but the flavour was great.

The decor is kind of fast food meets tiny sports bar. Its a little weird and I'm not sure if I'd want to spend a lot of time hanging out there outside of the time it takes to eat. However they do have a couple of \"lounge\" type seats and TVs so I assume they welcome people to hang out a bit longer than you would grabbing a quick bite.

I'd like to try a few more menu items so we'll be back!"}
{"text":"It is what it is..and it is great value for your money.   Dinner for two with bottled water was $23 and change.  The service is friendly and the food is consistently good.   I have been 3 or 4 times including today.   

Try it.  You'll like it.

Tried it again.  Excellent again.  Blackened Ahi tuna tacos and a cold beer in a chilled glass.   Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Loved the fish tacos and the Greek poutine. Tacos were above average. Poutine was delicious from the fries to the Greek topping. I'll stop back by when I get to Calgary. I wish someplace in Calgary brewed their own tea. Fountain tea is not good."}
{"text":"Very good Poutine! Delicious and tasty. Price wise somewhat elevated. Therefore a dent in the stars."}
{"text":"Finally, a place for fantastic poutine and other stuff in the SW!  I've been to Joey's Urban a couple of times, and I know I'll be heading there again soon.  They have the best \"regular\" poutine I've ever had in the city (prime cheese-to-gravy ratio), as well as a large variety of premium poutines, including Bacon Cheeseburger, Santa Fe, and Nachos.

If poutine isn't your thing - and I don't know why it wouldn't be - Joey's Urban has the same delightful fish and chips the regular chain has.  I also tried my first fish taco here today, and it was delicious.  The decor is also very nice, there is free wifi, and the staff is extremely friendly.  This was actually the only fast-food-ish place I've ever been to where the manager came around and asked how the food was - fantastic customer service.  While the food might be a tiny bit more expensive than your regular lunch stop, it is definitely worth it.  A++++, would eat again."}
{"text":"Please, fish taco?  Where the fish?  I ordered a taco and got a salad with a bit of fish. 2.50. For a medium sized fountain drink?  I feel totally ripped off.  The decor is nice, but I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Wow! Went in for $2 Tuesday at Urban to find its rebranded as StrEats! What a great change. It's the same place with the same food, but a new brand name a cooler cleaner feel/look. Great food as always, and very cool name that says Street Food!"}
{"text":"I found this place using yelp and was not disappointed.  I was unsure about the fish tacos because, living near Mexico, I have tasted some awesome creations.  The taco was fantastic. I also ordered a buffalo chicken taco and fries.  I plan to return to try some poutine.

The restaurant was clean and the staff was super friendly.  

There are so many awesome places to eat in Calgary that I told myself  I would not eat at the same place twice during my vacation.  It looks like I will be eating my words along side of the tacos and poutine."}
{"text":"Saw this place open up a little over a month ago. I'm not the biggest fan of fish and chips so I was in no hurry to try it out. Well today I found myself in the mood for sushi and my local place was closed. I figured it was time to try something new and boy am I glad I did. This isn't your typical Joey's Only. Along with the regular fish and chips, their menu offers excellent fish taco's, numerous offerings of poutine, and a solid variety of other nibblings. 

Having just tried my first fish taco last week in Vancouver (yes, I'm serious), I needed to try them here. Thankfully my bank is located in the strip mall cause I think I'm going to be spending a lot of my money here on those tasty bits. I'm not a huge fan of traveling downtown for poutine so having an option out here is another bonus. I already can't wait for my next visit and if you find yourself in the SW, I would recommend a visit."}
{"text":"I got the mahi mahi fish and the basa mango and they were both disappointing :( the fish was very small portion and there was too much filler stuff that was even tasty. I am a huge fan of fish tacos and primarily only eat fish. I've made better fish tacos at home. The reason I gave it a 4 star is because the staff were very friendly there and my husbands buffalo chicken poutine WAS AMAZING!  I would go back but not for a fish taco but for a poutine :) and I'd like to try the fish and chips also."}
{"text":"I love this place. Whenever I'm in the neighborhood, I always make an effort to eat here. The fish are cooked to perfection. The poutines are a healthy serving size and just simply scrumptious.  The place has a great atmosphere.

This place is truly a diamond in the rough.

I would give this place  6 out of 5 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Good place.  Nice step above fast food.  Taco's are very good and poutine is great.  Fish and chips are a bit too greasy."}
{"text":"If you want delicious, freshly made fish tacos this i your place. There are a variety of other tacos if you are not partial to fish, but I found that the flavor and freshness would make me choose fish every time. There is even an all-you-can-eat fish taco day (maybe Tuesday?) for about $14. 

Now, don't get me wrong, these are not authentic Mexican tacos by any stretch of the imagination. Instead, these are fusion tacos made with flour tortillas, fish/chicken/beef/shrimp, and served with a side of fries (or poutine). It's like CanMex...(as opposed to TexMex) and I loved it. I would say that my favorites have been the Mahi Mahi and the Shrimp Taco. The others are good but I found their chicken and beef to be a little wanting in flavor.

I haven't tried their other sides such as fries, poutine, or the onion rings. Mostly because when I'm in the mood for tacos, I only have room for tacos. However, everything does smell delicious so I would like to try it the next time I'm in.

The service is fairly quick as it's an order-at-the-counter type of place. Then you sit at a table or booth and they bring the food out to you. There is wine and beer available as well as soft drinks. As another reviewer pointed out, the location is kid friendly, so it's a great place to go if you want a tasty, quick family meal that is moderately priced. 

I'm not in the area often as I live in the northeast, but whenever I'm down in the south this is one of my favorite places to stop for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"I would never have found this place without Yelp and certainly without Thomas S.'s recommendation for the poutine here. Good choice!

Slow weeknight with heavy rain, there were only a couple of other customers in here when I arrived. Not the biggest menu board in the world, I chose the \"special\" poutine, which on this night was a Mexican one - chili and cheese and green onions. I was disappointed when it was served in a tall narrow container because a shallow but wide platter would have made it much more photogenic. Bummer. Which is not to say that it wasn't really really good, it just didn't photograph well so I can't share it with you.

Tacos, fish & chips and some other items on the menu, but I'd recommend the poutine as your main deal. Interesting selection of beers, I had a Big Rock \"Traditional Ale\" which seemed to go well with the mildly spicy and slightly greasy fries (not greasy in a bad way - that's what fries ARE!).

Free wifi worked excellent and the background music was quite tasteful and refined, fitting such an establishment well.

Try Joey's. You'll like it!"}
{"text":"For a fast food type of fish and chips place, this was fantastic. I haven't tried this chain since it was Joey's Only many years ago, and wasn't overly impressed. Have things changed! The variety of fish tacos, with $3.50 tacos on Thursdays, was great. We ordered the Vicious Taco, Baka Mango and Tropical Shrimp. Great toppings, fresh taste and delicious! I also ordered the haddock which wasn't fast-food priced but it was worth it. Beautiful piece of meat with the perfect batter and crispiness (even after a ten minute drive home with the takeout). The fries were good and poutine was ok. I can't wait to go back for more fish tacos! The service was also very attentive, friendly and something I have never before experienced - I had my toddler in one arm and the staff insisted on carrying out the bags to my car! Perhaps because they weren't super busy and had time, but that level of service just put this place at the top of my list for takeout! With it without that service, the food will bring me back too!"}
