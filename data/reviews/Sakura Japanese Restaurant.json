{"text":"Literally everything has a weird, off taste the only good thing is it looks clean and the people were pretty nice."}
{"text":"Okay Japanese. Sushi is okay too. Not bad but not great. Really 3.5 stars. The keyboard player on Friday nights sets the \"ambyanse\" if you know what I'm saying. I usually eat at a table, traditional plate dinner. They do have hibachi but from what I've seen it's not that impressive. Food quality is decent (4 stars). And that's ultimately what counts. They've had some \"cleanliness issues\" in the past. Not sure if those have been addressed tho. Haven't been back for a while. Cool place to eat outside when it's warm. Only downside is hearing the cheesy-sounding electronic bells from Brecksville town hall."}
{"text":"Sakura is clean and the service was very good. We were seated as soon as we entered the restaurant. The sushi was fresh and well presented. We've had a difficult time finding a sushi restaurant ANYWHERE in the area, and this was quite a pleasant surprise given some of the very bad reviews that I have seen on this site. 

I suspect that some of the bad reviews come from folks who are not actually used to Japanese food. The one that wrote he had a stomach ache is obviously a disgruntled employee or has some sort of ax to grind.

I'm very glad that we gave this restaurant a try in spite of some of the bad reviews here. I can't speak to the quality of the hibachi food as that is not our style. The sushi on the other hand was excellent."}
{"text":"My husband ordered Combo B.  The sushi is ok.  It is like what you would buy from the supermarket.  It is \"fast food\" sushi.  I ordered a chicken teriyaki bento box.  It was ok.  The prices were just too much for what we received."}
{"text":"The service is average and the food in terrible. I ordered the beef teriyaki and it was disgusting, literally indelible. I have no idea how or why this business is still operating."}
{"text":"inexpensive and fast! we all loved the sushi and the miso soup! the california deep fried roll was my fav!"}
{"text":"We ordered the spring rolls and calamari for appetizers.  Both were great!  The spring rolls came in a small portion, but that was perfect for us, and sauce for them was amazing!  I loved it!  I ordered the chicken teriyaki for dinner.  I like my teriyaki to be slightly sweeter, and I didn't get the sweet carrots with the dish... never had that with a Japanese meal.  Anyway, their special sauce was awesome!  Better than some out there I've had!  4 stars is for personal preference, but service was great, Sean never let my glass get empty, and he was very polite!  It was a great experience!"}
{"text":"Pretty bad food, but it's quick and vaguely resembles Japanese food, so it's acceptable to a york student palate."}
{"text":"Service was just okay, but the food was SO GOOD. Literally may be the best Japanese I've ever had. A little pricey, but will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Nice servers, awesome patios, fresh sushi with lots of options! Prices are good and portions are nice, we love coming here for group lunches at work. There are options for those who don't like sushi as well, the pad Thai is top notch. The pink lady and Christmas roll are my favorites. The servers Are very knowledgable and prepared to provide recommendations."}
{"text":"Nice lookin' place. Prices aren't horrible. But the food is meh. Wouldn't bash it if someone wanted to go there but wouldn't suggest it either."}
{"text":"I would not even give this place a star. I moved from Hawaii to Ohio a couple years back to live with my aunt who lived up the street from this restaurant. When I ventured out to see the neighborhood I was excited to see a sushi restaurant. I am a sushi snob. Every time I visit my extended family in Japan we always go out to eat sushi. Japanese people take their sushi seriously if it is not the best quality  the restaurant will go out of business. I have never tasted a sushi restaurant that was bad there. Now Hawaii is different there is very few places that are decent compared to Japan. But omg this place was a joke. I had some take out and went home to eat it and asked my aunt is this the only sushi she had ever tried. She replied,  yes and then I told her well no wonder you hate sushi. This tastes disgusting. So yeah, if this is what people in Ohio think Japanese food and sushi is they are sadly mistaken. Hopefully, they will get the opportunity to visit Hawaii, California, or New York City to get some decent sushi."}
{"text":"The ramen is not that special. It's basically a top ramen with meat, that's all. Shrimp tempura is crunchy but small portion compare to its price."}
{"text":"I truly enjoy their combination of Chicken teriyaki bento Their sushi is good and made to order. The only thing I dislikes was their beef teriyaki."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken teriyaki deluxe bento for to go. I should've checked my order before I left this place. When I opened the box, there were literally 6 small pieces of chicken. I paid over $1 for a small piece of chicken. 
Service was horrible. I am not sure if ownership changed or not but the person took my order seemed very confused with previous orders. Really disappointed at this place. Never again!! Don't waste your time and money here!!"}
{"text":"First I would like to say i really hate writing bad reviews...i much more enjoy giving an establishment high ratings and more stars...suffice it to say it has to be done...I had lunch here about a month ago with a co worker.  We were looking to get some quick asian for lunch and this place seemed to to be the ticket.  Well I'll explain why i'm giving it any stars at all.  It was very clean inside from what I could see and that is definitely important anytime food is involved.  Ok on to the food.  I can't even believe they would consider serving this kind of \"asian cuisine\" to anyone without expecting some confused diners.  I ordered the teriyaki and instead of some nice stir fried veggies under the chicken, i got iceberg lettuce chopped up and sauteed i assume.  it completely threw me off.  The sushi was just as bad with rice that seemed like it came from an uncle bens box.  To sum it up it was a waste of money and expectations for a decent meal.  Will not be coming here again."}
{"text":"Sakura is the love of my life. Ive had it over 5 times a week, every week. ( no I'm not exaggerating ) The teriyaki chicken is my favorite of all. #1 with a medium lemonade. The teriyaki sauce was made by god or something. Greatest place to grab teriyaki chicken. EVER."}
{"text":"Back when I was a Gastonia resident this was my go-to restaurant.  In those days Gastonia had little to offer other than fast food and an endless chain of chain restaurants.  It was both surprising and refreshing to find such a great restaurant in town at that time.  

I've only eaten sushi here and can honestly say that the only sushi in the greater Charlotte area that is superior to Sakura's is Nikko's.  The fish is extremely fresh and Peter's presentation is amazing.  Don't be fooled by the Old Navy shopping center location--this is really great sushi."}
{"text":"My husband loves teryaki, but the service here sucks...The crab rangoon was dry, hard and burnt the worst ever...The guy behind the counter gave me my own plastic bag, to bag up the containers in, really? What restaurant does that....they need some training in customer service and being professional. ..There is definitely no pride in their work....just lazy...."}
{"text":"Wow, I just had the most disgusting food there. It's really not worth anything. Can't find words. Just stay away, even if you are starving!! YUCK.
I just lost $13."}
{"text":"Absolute worst food and restaurant that we have been to in a long time. Every table was dirty, the floor was disgusting with trash and food everywhere, and the men's toilet was overflowing all over the floor. I had reservations about even ordering, and I wish I would have listened to my gut. The sushi wrap was premise and mushy. The ingredients were not fresh, you know what old fish tastes like. NASTY. The man working behind the counter was on his phone with earbuds in the entire time so when I tried to tell him about the bathroom he didn't hear me. I gave up at that point. I walked out and threw $34 of sushi in the trash. It was repulsive.  Highly do NOT recommend.  It's only one star bc I had to pick one or it wouldn't let me post this. This place gets zero stars from us."}
{"text":"The worst Japanese food place i have ever seen. Poor hospitality, Overly priced for the amount of food they give you on the plate.. Please never go to this place... You will regret for sure... Total waste of money.."}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi for a little spot. Always fresh and satisfying!"}
{"text":"I got the lion roll and the tiger roll and I know the other reviews where really bad but I honestly really enjoyed the lion roll! So if you're in the area and craving quick sushi get the lion roll !"}
{"text":"Ok, this review is on the SUSHI only.

I just had three rolls, and boy were they GOOD! They have expanded the sushi line-up since I ate here last (6 months?) There are so many deluxe choices now. I am not sure about the other dishes served here, but the sushi is pretty dang great. Dragon Roll FTW! :)"}
{"text":"Read reviews on Yelp prior to going, but decided to take office team for lunch, my mistake.  We had the hibachi room, which was dark, the demonstration was quick and not impressive, service was slow and the portions were very small, no taste,(selected a variety dishes), didn't matter.  Team left hungry.  Lack of lunch crowd was another giveaway, only two parties there the whole time.
 I'm surprised this place is still in business, especially in Brecksville. Next time take reviews to heart."}
{"text":"We went here for a date night, service could have been a little better we had to ask for silverware. We got miso and mussel soup which was good then my fiance got fire island sushi which he said wasn't hot but was really good flavor wise. I got the Boston sushi which was really good with the shrimp. I would go back"}
{"text":"Wow...the food is absolutely nasty. Even my husband the human garbage disposal refused to finish his food after a few bites. The food was very bland and their boba drinks tasted water down. I should have yelped this place before going in. Never going back again!!"}
{"text":"Great food- noodle soup is delicious and the sushi is fresh- big portions for a reasonable price.
Only complaint is the restaurant is uncomfortably warm- all the time- they need to either install ceiling fans or fix the a/c."}
{"text":"I went there for ayce dinner. There s a great variety of selections offered. However, there were many pictures on the menu. We order a handroll that we did not really like, but ended up ordering the same thing again because we didn't know its name! For the one with eel, there was way too much rice!"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has been getting bad reviews. We always come here once or twice a month to get sushi and never got a bad experience. One of my wife's favorite is the deep fried California roll! The staff is nice as well. They keep the place clean and cozy. Good price for good sushi!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. I used to love this place at the beginning. It wasn't the best food, but it was decent. However, a couple of months ago I bought some sushi and found a mosquito inside one of the rolls. I called the place and asked to talk to the manager but all she said was \"oh sorry I can change it for another meal.\" My boyfriend went back and just told them to give him his money back, the last thing I wanted was another meal from there! We stopped going for a couple of months. So a couple of days ago we decided to give the place another chance (bad idea) and went to order some sushi. The place was empty so I thought they would give us better service since they didn't really have anyone else to attend to. The guy who took our order had a really careless and shitty  attitude. On top of that we had to wait a while to receive the ONE roll of sushi we ordered. We got home just to find out that the avocado they used on my roll was rotten. It literally looked like a disgusting brown blob was placed inside each roll. Needless to say, I was extremely pissed off and went back to demand that they gave me my money back. The same guy with the careless attitude gave me my money back and refused to listen to what I had to say. He just kept saying \"sorry\" while giving me a dirty look and kept trying to talk over me. Shitty food AND shitty customer service?  Give me a break. I told him that if they didn't want to have any standards for their food they should just close down the place."}
{"text":"The chicken Katsu is tasty! You get 2 pieces of freshly fried Katsu on a bed of sushi rice, served with a small salad and pickles in the side for about $10. Good bang for the buck lunch!!

Avoid the sashimi lunch combo and the donburi lunch combo. Sashimi slices are extremely thin and you only get 6 pieces. Donburi has too much rice and noodles, not enough meat."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed. The sushi was not cold but the owner was! The girl who waited on me was fine but when asked about sashimi substitution there was a lot of loud discussion between the poor waitress and the chef or owner.... When I told her about the fishy taste and concern of freshness, there was no mention of removing it from my bill, she did remove the up charge for substitution....(I didn't eat it after trying) no visit from the owner, he stayed stoic on the bar stool. Place was empty.....

Service and food, I give less than 1 star, no second chances here...."}
{"text":"One star too many.

Plain and simple, if you have to choose between either eating here or sticking a metal fork in a toaster: choose the toaster."}
{"text":"I give it a 3... i don't want to trash talk but... I've been there plenty of times. every time I was there.. the cashier girl is always on her phone texting. she's a sweet girl I guess but her service isn't that great. it's hard for her to understand me sometimes and there has been times where there has been things left out of my order. SPEAK CLEARLY. the dude that makes the sushi is very standoffish. when everyone is in the back and he's the only one there he won't even take down your order, smile, etc. he just stands there. I think I've seen him smile like twice. at first going there they were kind of rude but they've gotten better. 

now about the food. shrimp, not a good choice. teriyaki, not a good choice. I love the 911 roll. now, it's not always fresh but realize you aren't paying that much money. the miso soup, definitely not the best I've ever had, and I've tried tons. but it's not terrible. . just depends on if you're looking for a quick japanese fix."}
{"text":"This place has the worse food and customer service!  You pay for what you get!  My Wife had the Tonkotsu Ramen Noodle with some sort of minced chicken on top and the soup taste like water and had no taste, so my wife requested the Shoyu Ramen and they took the Tonkotsu Ramen Noodles and Chicken from my wife's previous order and mixed it in the Shoyu broth and it taste worse.  My wife returned it and wanted something else and they refused service and returned my wife's money and looked at her like they wanted to do Kung Fu to her.  This is the last time we will go here!  Horrible place to eat!"}
{"text":"love this place!  in the heinens plaza.  food is really good, never too crowded.  affordable prices.  the green chicken curry & the penang chicken are awesome!"}
{"text":"The food was barely edible. The service was ok, but the disgusting food overshadowed anything else that might have been decent."}
{"text":"Okay. Do not order katsu chicken. Wasted $11 on this. Chicken taste bad and it's soooo small. Look at the amount of bean sprout they give you. Not worth $11 never coming back"}
{"text":"Mostly miss. Bad korean restuarant in disguise of bad Japanese restuarant. The pictures lie about the quantity, the price is too high for what you're getting and its not as healthy as you'd think. Try z-teca in York Lanes they charge as much but you wont be as starved 20 minutes afterwards."}
{"text":"I ordered Ramen Noodles and salmon roll. 

The soup was brought out first and set on their back counter for 10 minutes while waiting for another employee to make the salmon roll. 

When my order was ready.  The soup was Luke warm. The salmon roll was hot rice covered the fish making the fish warm.   Just a bad combination of temperature here.  I would normally complain but seems to have a major language barrier here.

It's fast food service is not liked by me . Quality control is zero. I will not return."}
{"text":"Their sushi is very good as well as their appetizers and soups. I don't really know about anything else though because these are the only three things we get every time we go. I love their phoenix roll very much and my boyfriend likes their creole roll. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because their prices are a little steep. Other than that, we love going for special occasions!"}
{"text":"I went to this place twice. The first time just to try it out and the second one was to give benefit of the doubt.  

First off the customer service sucks!!! When your ordering or when your just sitting and eating you can feel the staff gawking at you while you eat and they gossip infront of the customers too. They are very rude at asking orders and the food is nasty! The sushi is not fresh and it seems like they buy their products at the grocery store and mark it way up or something. The shrimp is either over cooked or under cooked and when you ask for extra condiments they will give you an attitude. 

I've only been at this place twice and I will never come back again, unless I see some improvements or ratings here on yelp that their getting better."}
{"text":"Ordered two bento deluxe and they tasted so bad we left most of them. No wonder this place was empty. There were two staff members inside. One was sitting at a table busy playing with his phone. The second one, who served us with the enthusiasm of a zombie, collapsed on the table next to us as soon as our food was ready and did not move even when we left. I had to check twice to make sure he was alive and breathing.
The chicken and beef teriyaki are now jumping up and down our stomach like the animals they once were. The tempura was over fried and dripping in oil. Never again."}
{"text":"i LOVE this place.

i love that it's right smack dab in the middle of lakewood, i love that it's nice enough to feel like you're having a night out, but not overbearing like \"crap, i have to get all dressed up for what??\"
i have been here several times, and each time, i walk away with a different good experience.  i've sat at the tables, i've sat in the hibachi cook your food in front of you section, and i've sat at the sushi bar.  the people who work here are so great, the food is good, and the atmosphere is \"neighborhood chic\". 

i think i'm coining that phrase.

i once spent a valentine's day here with an ex-boyfriend and my \"gay boyfriend\".  it was a damn good valentine's day.
and if i can say that, this is a damn good place to go.

and apparently the sushi is damn good too, but i don't do sushi so i wouldn't exactly know.  but my friends i was there with say it's really delicious.  and whatever they had was the \"banana split\" of sushi.  so get that.  cuz it looked pretty.

ah, now that's a sushiriffic review."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken noodle soup from here, they filled 2/3rds of it with bean sprouts, and they put a little bit of noodles (that were bland) and the soup was bland too. Keep in mind this is a chicken noodle soup that I got and I only got 3 small pieces of chicken & 1 piece of a bok Choy in the soup........ wth. Not worth it at all. Would never come here again. The workers also try to move fast because the line is long and they're often rude"}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place has such bad reviews because wasn't nearly as bad as they made it seem.

FOR HER: I ordered the teriyaki beef deluxe bento box.

FOR HIM: He tried out an order of the teriyaki chicken. 

The brown rice was good, but noodles are bland in the sense no vegetables are mixed in, and the bento box was lacking in meat. But honestly, everything tasted great and I left extremely full & satisfied. We finally found our alternative to the disappointing Teriyaki Madness up the street! :)"}
{"text":"Sad and confusing lunch experience. I mistakenly went to Sakura as I thought it was Teriyaki Madness which I'd bookmarked as a place to escape for lunch. Teriyaki Madness is somewhere down the road and because I'd already parked and walked up to the door, it wasn't worth another 15 minutes for me to hop down to Teriyaki Madness. What a tragic mistake.

Calling Sakura a restaurant is generous. Service was terrible-the girl who was playing cashier was rude and was having conversation with the other two guys behind the counter while I was ordering. Ramen isn't a complicated order, but at least give me the courtesy of your full attention when I'm ordering my food. I got the tonkatsu ramen and my Maruchan packet of noodles was served with a questionably cloudy broth (too much miso?) and three thin and DEEPLY unsatisfying pieces of pork. Yes I counted them. I kept hoping that my wandering chopsticks would bump into another piece of pork but kept coming up empty. I am embarrassed to say I finished most of the bowl because I was so hungry. 

I am also embarrassed to admit that I tipped $1 because this is one of those fast food establishments that presumptuously adds a tip line on their receipts. The only service I got here was someone dumping a pack of noodles into a plastic bowl, stirring up the ingredients and serving it to me when the noodles were soft. This does not constitute a tip of any sort and based on the uncomfortable 30 seconds at the register, watching the sushi chef roll sushi, ordering sushi does not warrant a tip either. He made one of the sloppiest rolls I've ever seen. If someone served me that roll, I'd send it back...and I don't send anything back. 

Yes, along with shamefully terrible ramen, they dare to serve eat-at-your-own-risk sushi. I imagine the rest of the menu is unauthentic Americanized Japanese dishes.  I'd rather go lick the floor of the Chipotle next door than eat here again. But I'll probably just get a burrito instead."}
{"text":"Not worth the money. No ambiance. Dirty menus, portions are bizarre, and the service is blah...Not to mention, the audio system is non existent. We dine at Wasabi all the time, and never had such a high bill, or such a poor experience. 2 stars because it wasn't complete neglect."}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times with friends. We usually visit about every 2-3 months. The hibachi is the best here and the sushi is tasty and flavorful. Te last visit , however, was very so-so. I ordered the chicken pad thai like i often do and had to push all of the chicken to the side. It was inedible. And the fried rice I ordered was full of black pepper (a lot more than usual and a lot more than I like). The service was slow and everything seemed off that day."}
{"text":"I want to be fair, I thought this was the same Sakura as in Akron and it doesn't seem to be as the Sushi, service and ambiance weren't up to that level. I still had a very good lunch of sushi and California roll at a reasonable price but it lacked anything special. I'd recommend it if cruising I-77 and looking to fill need for sushi but only if you can't get to Fairlawn/Montrose exit where the Akron Sakura has a little better everything."}
{"text":"I have only ever come here for Hibachi. I have had a TON of fun both times. It is a great double date spot! 

I know they have sushi and entres and you do not have to sit at the Hibachi, but why not? Who can resist having a shrimp tossed at your face?"}
{"text":"I ordered a Beef Teriyaki Bento ($7.99). It came with salad and 4 pieces of California Roll. The Beef Teriyaki had mushrooms, but not enough sauce. They didn't cook the beef like regular Teriyaki. It reminded more of Bugolgi. I think they forgot to put dressing on my salad. They didn't give enough wasabi."}
{"text":"I could say, the service and food can be fixed, someone has to care. The bits of chicken in the chicken teriyaki aren't going to make someone go back, the vegetables look and taste old, noodles are bland. The cashier looks like he doesn't wanna be there, and last time I was there, the cook had over 15 plates to make. Poor guy. I gave it a second chance and it really disappointed."}
{"text":"Seeing as how the last review is almost a year old.... AVOID this place.... I thought the food was ok and definitely not worth the price. To top it off, I now am able to write this review because I'm home from work sick with FOOD POISONING. Geez, 1 star is too much."}
{"text":"Been here twice. I enjoyed my maki rolls, especially the crunchy ebi rolls. Basil rolls were very fresh-tasting and delicious."}
{"text":"First off, this place is more of a fast-food Japanese restaurant that is similar to those places in the mall. 

We got this place because we were in a rush to pack and it was the closest thing that wasn't Chipotle or burgers. 

 
We got the chicken teriyaki plate which came with brown rice, 4 pieces of california roll and a side salad. 

We also ordered the \"lion roll\" which had dried pork on top with some yum yum sauce, and on the inside it was imitation crab meat. 

We didn't come in with the expectation that this place would have fancy elaborate sushi rolls. We were in a rush and just wanted something quick and cheap. 

Everything was good until I ordered an additional spicy tuna roll. -- SO NASTY. I have never had anything so fishy tasting/old at any sushi restaurant.. ever! I immediately spit it out. 

I wouldn't come back. Because just thinking back to that taste makes me want to avoid it! 
:("}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular. But the food is good. For the price.i had the teriyaki beef. It was tender with just enough sauce."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic little place.  I loved the feel of the whole place.  It was really nice, but comfy at the same time, and the food was excellent. The sushi was was truly great, full of flavor and presented creatively too.  The service was excellent as well.  The waitress was very attentive and she really tried to make our experience a good one.  I also have to mention the udon soup.  I've always been a fan of udon, and this place didn't disappoint.  It was very fresh tasting and the noodles were cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"This is not a good place to eat sushi. I spent $9 for 4 bites of sushi yeah it's so small and tiny rolls for $9 and Thai tea is not good at all. It first time and will be the last time for me."}
{"text":"I tried to like this restaurant but I just couldn't do it after three chances I gave it. The prices are cheap but what you pay is what you get. Nasty old fish,poorly put together sushi rolls,under cooked doughy tempura vegetables,really dirty floors,and horrid customer service. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I wish I would have read yelp BEFORE I are here. The service was ok but the food sucked. I had the Chicken Teriyaki with vegetables. What I received was a plate of rice with chicken and lettuce. I was in a hurry and was starving so I ate it but I promise I won't be back."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place since they first opened. I was really excited that a sushi place finally opened up close to my work. At first they were very good with generous portions and reasonably priced. I was also happy when they decided to add more items to their sushi menu. But ever since they changed staff behind the counter, things have gone down hill. My rolls BARELY have any fish in them. I have even gotten rolls with no tuna or salmon in them at all! The rice is sometimes over cooked, the avocado has been hard as a rock and TWICE the chick at the register pretended to stamp my card and really didn't."}
{"text":"I don't really find myself in Gastonia that often, much less trying to grab some food there, but I was on my way to Atlanta from Charlotte and it was obvious we were going to hit traffic along the way, so we just stopped at this little spot right off the interstate.

This place is a little strange, it has the feel of the cheap fastfood japanese places that have been popping up all over, but they actually made some not so ordanary specialty rolls.

I had the hibachi chicken and it was absolutely horrible.  I wouldn't have eaten it if I wasn't going to be stuck in the car for the next 4+ hours.  I'm pretty sure it wasn't even chicken.

My buddy ordered a salad and just asked for pieces of sashimi on it, and it was good looking and tasting.  I'm not a fan of having to order something not on the menu to make sure its edible, but if your in a hurry then this place is doable.  I honestly don't know of much better in the Gastonia area.

Oh yeah, service, I may have been a little hung over and mumbling, but our waitress just had absolutely no clue what I was saying.  I'm down for cultural diversity and all, but it was a little over the top."}
{"text":"I have been here before for sushi at lunch and never really had an issue to speak of...  however, today I opted for the Gold Sesame Chicken.  This was a small tray of hot slime, at best.  The chicken was neither crispy or chicken in texture or appearance.  While warm, the sauce was tasteless and unexciting and only seemed there to give the soft breaded mushballs a bath to float in.  The rice was overcooked and ultimately the only part of this lunch that wasn't a complete failure was the zucchini and broccoli which I think was only not overcooked by accident rather then skilled practice.  I will not be going back for lunch as there is no shortage of restaurants in the area.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"This place was not good, it shouldn't even be allowed to be called a sushi place. Tables were wobbly and sticky, we ordered some rolls and combo plates they give you salad on your plates with generic ranch packets instead of the ginger dressing it's supposed to come with.  The best thing we ordered were the California rolls. I will not come back to this place and if your a true sushi lover you wouldn't even waste your time"}
{"text":"We are way out on a limb here as a family.  I'll eat darn near anything.  My wife isn't very picky either, however the kids are totally hot dogs, pizza, and chicken fingers kids.  I blame myself.  Anywho we were tired of pizza and burgers on our road trip and thought we would try hibachi.  Now I love sushi and ordered a roll, Red Dragon. It was just ok.  It was big which was nice, but I had no one to share with.  I also had Pad Thai which was pretty good.  My wife had chicken hibachi while the kids split chicken fried rice.  

I'm glad we went, it was nice.  I would recommend calling ahead if you want to sit at the hibachi table."}
{"text":"This place was not good at all they had several items that looked really  good in the picture but when they gave us the food the fried rice was black nothing with what the picture represented the cook and the guy seemed to know that it looked to dark and yet did nothing of it I decided to go next door to the Hawaiian bbq and was not disappointed. The yakisaba was also really bland and unappetizing. Never coming back here"}
{"text":"Price decent, stingy, sloppy 

I got an eel roll not sure if the eel was good because there was none in there."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst.
Ordered a chicken cutlet and bulgogi to go, the lady keep saying pork, and after I reminded her twice, unbelievable, I still got the pork!
Bulgogi is just too sweet and rice is overall very dry. 
Cutlet is thin and also dry."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant with my family today. Upon arrival it was very empty, which scared us. There's plenty of parking. We sat on the upper level in a booth because I have a young son. The menu has very fair prices. We ordered miso soup to start and two combination teriyaki regular dinners. The regular size was more than enough, so I wouldn't suggest springing for the deluxe. One thing that can be improved is the cocktail menu. My bf asked for a mango margarita on the rocks, but we were told we couldn't have a flavored marg on the rocks, only frozen. But all in all GREAT experience. Lastly, my son got sick and had a little accident in the booth which the waitress was more than understanding of. Good customer service. If you're ever in the area and want unauthentic, but great tasting hibachi,  give them a try!"}
{"text":"Went here for sushi, we ordered the volcano dip as an appetizer. It was ok served with wafer crackers, as for the sushi we got the spicy tuna, Philly roll and the tempura shrimp. Both tuna and philly lacked flavor the tempura had a good flavor but overall the pieces were little and needless to say we had to make a mcdonalds stop on the way home. Good sushi just not enough for the price and flavor!"}
{"text":"I can only speak to the sushi, but what I saw was very good. I'm from NY and have been looking for a place in the area to get decent sushi without going to Charlotte, and this is it. It's a bit more expensive, but totally worth it. Definitely a step up from Sake Express: it looks like they actually put effort into cooking it, and know what they're doing. Unfortunately, the service wasn't great. A bit rude, and it seemed like everything there was sticky: menus, booths, tables, etc. Just wish they delivered!"}
{"text":"I'm a little insulted that the \"Cleveland Roll\" is essentially a California roll with a mountain of mayonnaise on top of it.  Yup we Clevelanders pretty much just put mayonnaise on stuff. Just sayin."}
{"text":"The most horrifically bad Asian food I have ever had.

We ordered the Philadelphia roll and tempura shrimp with vegetables.

The rice in the Philadelphia was mashed so the rice was one solid white paste spread onto the seaweed. The sushi was chewy and the you could definitely tell that none of the ingredients were fresh.

The shrimp tempura with vegetables was disgusting and not edible at all. The food was floating in grease. The shrimp was not crispy, just mushy. The tempura vegetables (broccoli, yam, carrot) were also mushy, not crispy, and greasy like fried chicken. The rice was not sticky white rice I'm used to at Japanese restaurants. It was almost grainy, like it was undercooked. It was more like couscous.

This was a complete waste of money. I was so sad because I love sushi and living in north east Las Vegas, there is nothing nearby. I was willing to give this place a chance because it was located in a prime spot--sandwiched in between Chipotle, a spa & 5 Guys at the south end of Lowes parking lot--but I'm expected that spot to be for rent very soon."}
{"text":"Sakura got me hooked...  And then, let me down.  This place is right around the corner from my work...  So, it was very convenient.  I gave them a try and was hooked!  The food is very good.  I have stopped going, however.  The place, at least the grill area, is filthy!  I saw it a few times...  And, I just tried to ignore it.  The last time I was there, the cook dropped some of my teriyaki chicken on the filthy part of the grill area...  Then, he proceeded to pick it up with the spatula he was using, throw it back on the grill and then into the box they presented me.  That was the last straw.  I have been in there since, HOPING that they've cleaned up...  But, it's still dirty.  BEWARE!!!"}
{"text":"the sushi is fantastic, very creative decoration, and delicious, i really enjoy their mango roll, cleveland roll, dynamite roll.... they are awesome!!!!
never seen a sushi chef is a female, she is nice and friendly. 
this place not all about sushi, they have other dishes such as hibachi and thai dish, 
definitely will come next time try other food..... good restaurant!!"}
{"text":"This is the place with out the showthus place is awesome you get a lot for the money and the eye candy ant bad"}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. Food is disgusting. I'm sure it was made with chemicals as the food all tasted like gasoline. My daughter ordered the strawberry Boba and it was spoiled. It's expensive and NOT worth your time and money."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and I decided on a little sushi and soup.  I had the Coconut shrimp sushi roll with mango, avocado and cucumbers and the Tofu Noodle soup.  Both were good and solid foods for a cold day.  I could have used more tofu in my noodle soup and more greens but overall it satisfied my hunger without making me feel bloated with sodium laden soups.  The food court is chaotic especially when there are kids on a school trip but this place is good enough as my go to lunch meal when I am out of options."}
{"text":"Sakura is great place that we discovered while looking to have dinner at one of the major food chains.  This place didn't disappoint, the food was fresh and well prepared.  The portions were better than expected and well worth the price.  Overall, our experience with the food was excellent but the service was decent.  Granted the place was hopping so I still gave four stars.  I would also recommend Sakura to anyone looking for a nice Japanese restaurant for family and friends to enjoy."}
{"text":"My experience here was not very memorable. Sashimi portion of the lunch ayce was not at my expectation nor was it any good to begin with. Regardless of the variety of their lunch menu, the service was great. Lunch is approximately $12.99; very affordable, especially for students around the area. I would return to the restaurant in the near future."}
{"text":"Not what I was expecting. Any Japanese restaurant I went to had the chef cook right in front of your table and you get the show the chef performs for you and the interaction. That was my first disappointment. Second was the high prices on the menu for the dinner entrees. I was ready to go back to Hillbilly's for a steak and ribs. Service was very kind and polite. The blond hostess was absolutely beautiful. I ordered the Fried Calamari which seemed fresh but the batter was a bit light and overall was quite chewy. The Japanese 22oz Beer \"Sapporo\" was great! Got it in a frosty mug just the way I like it without even asking for the frost mug. (I hate when I order a beer and the waitress/waitor just plops a bottle in front of me with no glass to pour it in). Soup was good and salad was fine. The entree I ordered was the Tempura Combo Fish, Chicken, Shrimp with Fried Rice. It was quite awful. Flavorless. Then I added a bit of soy sauce to the rice and it was too salty. I would have been better off ordering Chinese for the family at a total of $14. Bill for 2 people was $60 and disappointing. I don't mind spending that money on dinner if the meal was awesome but I won't be going back again."}
{"text":"Great food and service. I have only eaten the sushi here and it is freshly prepared and the presentation is awesome. Best location in Gastonia for sushi."}
{"text":"They sell fast food style Japanese food,Korean food,sushi,dimsum,tempura.
Some of the menu items:
pork bone soup,dduk guk,yakitori,don katsu,chicken katsu,unagi donburi,shrimp roll,veggie tempura,dim sum(come early for this one),Korean snacks.
For sushi,they usually carry salmon,eel,california,tuna kimbap,etc.
I don't think this place is that clean.
Once I found a dead fruit fly in my soy sauce..."}
{"text":"Oh, I hate doing this. But it must be done. 

I've been going here on and off for the last ten years. This was the only place my son and I used to be able to go for good sushi and my wife and daughter would enjoy the chicken Katsu. Since I first started going here I've watched them take out the shag rug and replace it with a cleaner wood floor. I've seen the uptick in cost and always felt the nice bowls, plate styling and great food made up for it. But that was then. 

First off, still come for sushi. That's good. There are two stars here and if you need a sushi fix that is still good. The kitchen has changed. I hope it's a Sunday night thing. 

The miso soup that came out was not hot to the point of steaming. It was warm enough that I didn't worry about it being bad, but it's soup. The house salad is green pre-cut lettuce with carrot shreds. Then the entrées came. 

All four were luke warm. It had the heat and consistency of a microwave or sitting on the hot bar for a while, not fresh made like we are used to here. Worse yet the bento box styled dishes have given way to stock diner plates. Honestly, I've had better at lucky samurai up the street at a better price. 

Lastly, our server took three tries to get our order in right. Thankfully the copy of the order came with the receipt because she did enter the special requests right, but the kitchen just ignored some of them. 

So yes, I'll still drop in for sushi at the bar solo or with my son. But it's sad to lose a solid place for a special night out with the family. 

Oh well. I'll be back on sushi night. If the miso gets hot again I may even try an entrée. But I think this place is in twilight and on its way out. Sad to see it go."}
{"text":"Seeing low reviews on Yelp hasn't deterred me before. I should have taken heed because they were pretty much spot on. 

Second sign I should have paid attention to - the place was completely empty. Walking in, I would have had the entire place to myself. 

Third sign - one of their staff got into a verbal altercation with my dad about an extra side he ordered. All he asked for was extra sauce for his tempura and possibly because of a language barrier, it became somewhat heated. Good thing we were the only people in the place.

Fourth sign - Ranch dressing for your salad from a Japanese restaurant?

Anyway - to the food.

I ordered the shrimp bento. That comes with a California Roll, Salad, Rice, Shrimp and Mushrooms. The roll was not freshly made. The rice on the roll was dried out like it had been prepared earlier just waiting to be served. I didn't eat the salad as it came with ranch dressing. I didn't expect that from a Japanese restaurant. The shrimp, though cooked, was overcooked. The same went with the mushrooms which were cooked together. Made the shrimp a little chewy and the mushrooms soggy. 

I actually like the white rice most of all. Not because of anything out of the ordinary - I just don't eat a lot of rice anymore so it was like a treat for me. 

Could have been just the cook however with all the choices just in that same plaza alone, there won't be a revisit for an improved rating thanks to their poor customer service."}
{"text":"I am really torn between a 2 and a 3.  In the end though, I am willing to give Sakura its first 3 star review.  There are enough 1 and 2 stars here from reputable Yelpers, so I'll give a more optimistic viewpoint!  

I don't like cheap teriyaki, so I went with a couple of sushi roles. I had the philly role and the spicy tuna roll, both at $4.25 a peace.  The price was definitely right!  They were actually better than I expected.  Each cut was a large mouthful.  The fish itself wasn't spectacular, but it was eatable.   It could have been a little ore fresh.  

The service was pretty unfriendly.  This appears to be a family ran joint, but they aren't Japanese (or Korean), not that it matters to me.  That's all this whiteboy can tell you.  I had to get myself a to-go container to mix my wasabi and soy sauce.  I guess I could have asked, and I am probably spoiled with all of the sit-down restaurants that I patronize.  This place is definitely more of a to-go place, and for its speediness I give it an extra star (yeah, its reaching, I know).  

I might come back here for a quick bite of sushi since I work in the area and there aren't any other sushi places close by.  It wasn't all that bad.  I don't get any warm fuzzies from the place, but the price is right and you can be in and out in 15 minutes."}
{"text":"For the price good rolls! Just make sure the prep staff and cooks wash their hands before making your food.

Trust me on that one!"}
{"text":"I was visiting some family friends and we decided this would be a good lunch option. We were all looking forward to it especially with all the media attention this place received (you can see it when you walk in). 

Well we walked in, they had us wait for a table...there were like 5 parties total in the whole establishment. What was the wait for? 

Second, they sat us in the corner behind the entrance. I thought that was weird - especially since there were a number of tables available NOT in the corner with the rest of the patrons. 

Food - I got the chicken katsu and I have to say it wasn't too bad - but what's hard about Katsu? Nothing. You take chicken or pork, make it thin, bread it and fry it. That's all there is to it. 

All in all, I probably wouldn't go back to this place not because of the food quality but the overall service was seriously lacking. It REALLY bothers me that we were sat away from everyone in the corner...really?"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Sakura twice now for lunch.  I have not tried the sushi but I have had the hibachi and various appetizers.

First of all, good luck finding the restaurant.  There is a sign on I-77 northbound directing patrons west to the restaurant.  There is one more sign on SR 82 pointing further west... after that you're on your own.  I drove around for a half an hour looking for the restaurant the first time I was there.  The plaza it is located in does not have \"Sakura\" on the placard at the street... I just happened to see it next to Heinen's as I was driving by.

The ambience of the restaurant is nice... if they dim the lights in the evening it's probably beautiful, though not a classy-type of place.  I did feel rushed both times I was there (which I hate) however I was there at lunch and the service may not be the same in the evenings.

I have had the same young male server both times I was at the restaurant.  Yesterday I glanced to my left only to be greeted by the complete band of his underwear staring me in the face as has was bussing the booth across the aisle... not exactly appetizing.

I have had the hot (lukewarm) sake, edamame (mushy/cold), spring rolls (scalding grease outside/stringy cool cabbage inside), and shrimp dumplings.  I would like to mention here that several dishes (including the shrimp dumplings and ESPECIALLY the hibachi) had the taste and aroma of kerosene.  It did not make me sick, however it was cloying and ruined the taste of the food.

The hibachi was the greasiest I have ever had.  I had the ribeye and scallops which was served with salad (good), soup (good), and a shrimp appetizer (2 small shrimp).  The ribeye was as thin as a flat iron steak.  I ordered it rare but it must have been too thin to cook that way because it came out medium well.

Yesterday when I was there (I must have overstayed my welcome - I was there for 90 minutes) my waiter brought me the check and told me to \"pay up front\" afterwhich I never saw him again.  It was 1:45 in the afternoon when I left.

Disappointing..."}
{"text":"I used to go to York and spent most of my meal plan for my first few year here . Then I stopped going. I found their food taste acceptable - def not great. I even remember the dish I saw on most students' table back then - gamjatang. The service was usually quite decent actually. What really turned me off was the hygiene and sanitation. My roommate who was working there back then advised me not to go there as the kitchen was really dirty. I did not take it seriously till one day, the student sitting next to me saw a dead fruit fly in his rice. He went up to the counter and the owner came up. They offered him a new dish. I think he should have asked to get his money back instead but he let it go. I never went back myself since."}
{"text":"Quite the update from awhile ago... this place has definitely grown on me! Despite the other reviews, this place actually isn't too bad. Conveniently placed where the lunch rush goes and is a great alternative.

The chicken teriyaki is always on point and very delicious."}
{"text":"I have ate  at hibachi restaurants my whole life. This was the worst experience I have ever had. I have had better dining experiences in a food court of a mall then this place. Worst service out of any restaurant I've ever been to. The food was not good and undercooked and the whole dinner was terrible. I would recommend attempting to make a hibachi at home over this place! Never again!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and bad quality. If you want korean/japanese food just bus down to yonge and finch, any restaurant down the street there is better and still cheaper (bus fares included) than this place."}
{"text":"If I could give a negative # I would! I was eating my sushi when a worker walked over to my table stepped on something than left. As I looked down it was a dead cockroach!!! She left it there..next to my table. Never came back to pick it up! Disgusting!! Sushi was decent until that!!! Can someone call health inspection please!!"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and chef was very entertaining. Food was VERY so-so. Sushi was loosely rolled and sauces tasted like they were store bought versus made from scratch. The tepanyaki was very \"benihana\" in quality.  Friend rice had waaaay too much soy sauce and barely any vegi's. The shrimp was over cooked but the scallops were good.   Overall it was pretty disappointing for the price. I would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"We have been going to Sakura on and off for several years.   The sushi has always been very good and we recently went there with our daughter for hibachi and the food was also very good.

Maybe it's just me, but the atmosphere is such a turn off.   This place is always practically empty, which is just so odd to me.   There are so few restaurants in Brecksville that you would think there would be more guests.

If they make the atmosphere a little more \"trendy\" it might attract more business.   Or maybe I'm the only one who feels strange eating in an empty restaurant.  It's too bad cause the food and service has always been very good."}
{"text":"I called in an order for two hand rolls: one salmon and one spicy tuna. Should have checked my order before walking out the door and heading home. I opened my bag to find normal salmon and spicy tuna rolls. Quality wasn't great...a lot of rice and not much fish. Was pretty upsetting :(. But the order WAS ready by the time I got there..I guess that's worth the second star? 

If there's another option in vicinity, definitely always 1000% choose the other option."}
{"text":"Terrible. Got sushi nigiri and a house salad and a miso soup. Everything was so disappointing. The house salad was just lettuce, with some avocado slices on there. As in sandwich lettuce. The miso soup was super watery and the nigiri sushi was chewy. I wish I could get my $17 back and I hope I don't get sick. Ended up throwing half of it away. Stay away. Overpriced and not good."}
{"text":"Sub-par sushi that's on the same level as grocery store sushi.  Horrible soy sauce.  Chicken teriyaki had no \"teriyaki\".  This is the McDonalds of Japanese joints.  Mere sustenance."}
{"text":"Came across this restaurant on my way home with my husband and daughter. I've heard of \"Sakura\" before and thought it would be good. Our waitress seemed completely clueless. She wasn't too friendly either. We ordered miso soups, I ordered shrimp&chicken pad Thai, and my husband ordered sushi lunch, and chicken fried rice for my daughter. The pad Thai came out and looked nice minus the fact that there were 2 shrimp in the whole dish. The pad Thai noodles were thick fettuccini like pasta noodles which was disappointing. The sauce also didn't taste like the peanut sauce that's usually on pad thai. My husband enjoyed his sushi and my daughter loved the rice. However, having said that, my daughter and I both got sick later on that evening.. Not sure I would ever come back just because of that. Also all were from the lunch menu and we ended up paying over 45.00 for lunch."}
{"text":"I've been here sooo many times, and everytime I kinda am underwhelmed, but for what it's worth, it does do a great job being an on-campus dining option for York students.

Lemme break down the menu for you guys (its super simple!)

a) You chose your type of meat : Salmon, Beef or Chicken - you have different styles of cooking, bbq - fried - teriyaki
b) it comes with mix salad and rice
c) you can swap out rice for fried noodles for a charge, or they can slather your rice in \"sauce\" for free


They also have a new korean section, where they serve bibimbap, gamjatang, bulgogi and other stuff.

The GT is super tiny compared to any other place in toronto, and not in a stone bowl, obvs its york uni.

The kalbi is a hit and miss. At my table once three of my friends got it, and each tasted different.

The katsu is great!

The Yakitori is really good too, but takes forever so be warned!


Super plus point : San Pelegrino Sodas (Aranciata Rosa with EVERYTHING)"}
{"text":"Didn't love it and wont be back. I went for ramen but there was no ramen I was tired so I got teraki and rice. I could have had better flavor with an Hawaiian plate. If your looking for Chinese food may I suggest something else, even Panda express."}

{"text":"Their sushi is OK, nothing noteworthy. However their shrimp yakisoba wasn't bad. Also the service was alright, nothing to rave or complain about. Overall it is you don't grt what you pay for because the price isn't up to par with the food."}
{"text":"Well, this is no dine in tepanyaki shop. Its a fast food chinese joint through and through. I irdered two items, no frills or any extras. The noodles, shrimp and rice tasted good but they had no veggies in it either. I got what i paid for, ive had worse! This filled me up and the flavor was acceptable. Ill be back if im ever in a hurry and chipotle is packed."}
{"text":"Sakura Creekside (in Brecksville - there are several that have a similar name) is my favorite non-buffet Japanese/sushi restaurant in the Cleveland area.  They have an extensive sushi bar of course, regular table seating, and hibachi grill/table service.  The full service bar (drinking and eating) is popular on Friday and Saturday nights.  I have not tried the hibachi, but the sushi, regular entres, and bento boxes are all very good and tasty.  When eating at the restaurant, I'll often go for the sushi combo for variety or a bento box when not in the mood for sushi.  Entres come with a complimentary miso soup and ginger salad.  We also get a lot of carry-out from them when in the mood to relax and enjoy a blu-ray movie.  I like to order the maki-trays for carry out - a small = 4 maki roll orders, a medium = 6 orders, and a large = 8 orders.  I'll often add ala carte sushi and a few specialty rolls like a \"scorpian roll\" or \"spider roll\" (tempura shrimp or soft shell crab) to add variety.  I've hosted large parties using delicious food from Sakura.  See posted photo of a large maki tray.  Get some."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time today and we won't be coming back.  At first glance, the food looked burned.  (okay, here we go)...The yakisoba was so greasy and the soba noodles were extremely overcooked and mushy.  The chicken was still cold on the inside from not being cooked properly.  Extremely disappointed.  Don't waste your time and head to Tokyo Cafe across the street instead."}
{"text":"I like this place, despite the aged look and kind of \"messiness\" ... it has not changed in over 7 years. There is good and bad to that, of course. There is familiar stability in knowing exactly what you are going to get.
I usually order unagi don, and it comes with miso soup. Today after one sip of miso I realized I'm not taking another sip (my friend said it tastes off because the base is chicken broth, but I highly doubt that). Cleanliness is questionable too. 
This place is more of a throw back memory, and it's still around and it's still the same. One of the few things that are not changing at York University"}
{"text":"I took a chance on this place since Chipotle was so busy.  I had the chicken teriyaki deluxe bento box to go for dinner. It was okay but I have to say it got cold since I took so long to get home. The salad was a few pieces of lettuce. The California roll was small and I couldn't taste any cream cheese. I liked the chicken but it was a small portion on a large bed of sticky white rice. I also got the edamame. It was hot an delicious.  If you want fast food sushi I think you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"First time coming here and probably the last. Our server Brandy was great and provided everything we needed. The food was mediocre but most importantly my family could immediately tell if the foods were re-heated or not. The biggest issue me and my family had was the WATER. Every member of my family tasted water that resembled pool water filled with chlorine whether it was hot tea, soda, or sweet tea. This small issue became something bigger just because we could not bear to drink anything with our food. Hope this feedback helps"}
{"text":"Asked what veggies are in the Teriyaki Bowl and got nothing of what the girl told me. I got a bunch of mushrooms instead which I can't stand.."}
{"text":"Honestly...I'm baffled at some of the reviews. The quality of the salmon and the 'super white' tuna they had was one of the best...and I've had quite a lot of sushi. I've had sushi in Japan, Dubai, New York... I am SO coming back here. A friend and I came in here on a Tuesday-- it wasn't that busy so we had the chef's full attention. I am so happy I came!"}
{"text":"Consistently great food, generous portions and friendly service. I cant understand why people will flock to Sake Express and eat dry bland food when they can eat at Sakura for same. This is Gastonia's hidden gem. Also better than lotus."}
{"text":"I took my mom to eat here as we love hibachi! I haven't been here in years so I was so excited to see they have Thai on the menu! We sat at a table (we were told the hibachi had a \"longer\" wait) and she ordered the chicken hibachi and I ordered a dungeon (I believe!) Dragon Sushi roll and the Pineapple Curry Chicken. We all really liked everything we got! I do wish there was double the pineapple in my curry (and possibly a lil more chicken). But loved the broth and even brought it home to cook w the next day! 

Also our waiter was one of the most courteous and nice guys! We will be going back!"}

L&l is next door go there. There food is so worth $10"}
{"text":"This place has an awful food, the miso soup, house salad with Ginger dressing were the worst soup and salad that I ever have had. Edamame was not fresh, and let me tell you about the sushi was not appetizing, the rice was not sticky and the fish was not fresh at all. 

Basically I do not recommend this place at all. I'm writing as I'm sitting in front of the door with a really bad stomach ache."}
{"text":"Salmon sashimi is great, but the food quantity is little, the price is high, service attitude in general, the food was fine, still can try!"}
{"text":"As someone else commented, this place really is \"the fast food\" of asian restaurants. The place is clean and employees are working hard, but the food is terrible.  First off, this is NOT japanese food. It's advertised as such but it is a Chinese restaurant.  I really hope people don't eat this stuff and believe its Japanese....as a Japanese person, that makes me want to cry. Anyway,  I ordered a $9 bowl of ramen that turned out to be instant ramen. It was the first time I had a broccoli in my ramen. Terrible....people do not eat here unless desperate."}
{"text":"I ordered Teppanyaki-Grilled Tuna & Shrimp Marinated in Coconut Milk & Fresh Herbs w/ Miso Soup, Salad, Veggies & Steamed Rice $21.95. This was way over priced!! This plate was not freshly cooked and the veggies were not fresh as the carrots were so soft. The miso soup was not hot. My friend ordered the Seafood Noodle soup $13.95.  The soup was warm it had artificial crabmeat. it had very fishy taste. Everything just tasted like we were eating left over food. If you want this type of food I would recommend Sake Express."}
{"text":"Restuarant is clean and next to a Five Guys (Craig/Losee).  Came out here and had to make the decision...Burger or Sushi?  I chose the sushi and ended up regretting it.  The rolls were not fresh, loose, and basically tasted like cardboard.  Maybe their other items are good, but not coming back to find out.  

Btw, service was just average.  Just opened this year and maybe they'll get better.  With so many other sushi spots in Vegas, no reason for me too come back."}
{"text":"Horrible! Stay away! Rude staff, they did not say one word when we entered the building and were on their phones the entire time we were there.  It took almost 30 min to get our 4 rolls and there were only 2 other people there.  The rolls were nasty! Fish was mushy, no flavor, the seaweed was hard and the crab was so fishy I could not eat it.  I will never go back!"}
{"text":"I came in for lunch as I work nearby. The place was clean as far as I could tell  but the food was awful.  I ordered a teriyaki chicken and shrimp and the shrimp were very small and rubbery that accompanied my chicken pieces of an unknown source on a white bed of rice.  Only a few squirts of teriyaki sauce to top it off made the sauce scarce as well. I was very disappointed. Not coming back."}
{"text":"No draft beer selection even tho it has it on the menu. Slow service and just ok food. Huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Let's get straight to it!

Service
The people were fine. Natural and courteous.

Food
TERRIBLE!! I ordered a beef dish and the beef was gummy and tasteless! It was terribly disappointing. This place needs a huge revamp if they're gonna stay afloat. Even the yum yum sauce was subpar. Everything about the food was just garbage! Please do not waste your time or money!"}
{"text":"Good solid sushi place. Creative rolls. Very fresh. Fun hibachi. Love the seaweed salad. I love this place"}
{"text":"Bad. We ordered an Alaskan roll which was salmon, avocado and cucumber inside and salmon on top. It came out and was salmon on top with crab and cucumber on inside. I went up to tell him it was wrong. No one spoke good enough English to understand and he kept telling me they don't put avocado in there rolls anymore. I asked why it was on the menu then? He gave me the run around while the other worker is sitting in the background saying offensive things in Japanese . I didn't feel like arguing so I walked away. The manager lady kept giving me dirty looks. What's funny is they didn't know I could understand what they were saying. Salad didn't come with dressing and the tempura was soggy and didn't come with dressing."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat!! Love the atmosphere, great service, great food! Fresh sushi and my favorite place for date night cause it's not stuffy/pretentious...I can have fun and booths give privacy. Food comes fast. Friendly super nice staff and good prices. Lots of menu options."}
{"text":"I stopped by here for lunch because I didn't feel like chipotle...maybe I should have gone to chipotle anyway....I ordered 2 rolls, the 911 roll (this is nine eleven, not nine one one) and the Lion roll. The Lion roll was definitely the better of the 2 but if you are putting teriaki pork on the outside of the roll, I'm not expecting it to be dried. 
I had a couple issues with service. 

1. No receipt. Yes I could have gone up and asked for it but I was waiting for my food anyway (10+ min)  and I saw them coming out with it.

2. No I did not want my meal to go, i was eating there and I was starving. I did not expect it to come out in plastic containers.

3. I expect something labeled 911 to be hot and spicy. This sadly disappointed.

About an hour or so after lunch my stomach was not overly happy with me for this choice in lunch. I've had much better elsewhere. 

If you find yourself in the area and the choice is chipotle, famos dave's and Sakura, don't choose Sakura."}
{"text":"I've been going to Sakura for over 10 years and it is still one of my favorites.  I have never had anything I didn't like and I have no idea what is up with the negative comments.  Must be pretentious people that  don't know what good food is.  Chicken Maki Rolls are a must try and the fried rice too, but I can't go without eating the sushi.  Love, love, love Sakura!!"}
{"text":"This is only regarding the sushi. I have not tried anything else. The place seems to be family owned and mostly operated by family. English, I think, is a second language to them so please be patient when you hit a language barrier. The sushi was made fresh and was great! I've come back here 4 times now and have constantly received great food, and a smile! FYI It's mostly a (fresh) fast food type place."}
{"text":"This place is crap.  Thats just flat out the truth.  How do you mess up tempura sauce? The food isnt fresh and im surprised this pos isnt closed yet.  Im hoping I dont get sick. Dont go here its not worth your time or money.  Save yourself from getting sick!"}
{"text":"Update:
They had a change of ownership. and the cheapening out on ingredients is awful.
Ordered beef teriyaki on rice - it had one small broccoli chopped into 5 pieces, plus bits of beef that would fit in the palm of your hand. Sounds like a decent portion right?
Picture them laid out flat on your palm, piece by piece like a jigsaw puzzle. That's what you get. They give you tons of rice though, half of which I threw out.
If you got a craving for Japanese food, go down to Hosu on the Queen."}
{"text":"Sushi is ok but hot food are terrible. Instant noodle is better than their noodle soup. Probably will never come again."}
{"text":"Second disappointing experience in a row. The restaurant is very clean, the food was descent but the service was unacceptable. Slow, no check back and a lack of caring. The manager asked how everything was and responded with a poor excuse and how sometimes you can only hope that they could do the best that they can do with all of the large parties. There were 3 tables in the restaurant.. All small tables."}
{"text":"This place is not fast. Your friends may be getting food at Chipotle, or Five Guys, or Subway. They will be waiting for you and your teriyaki bowl that took nearly 15 minutes to assemble at dinner time. But then you can smugly enjoy your brown rice and steamed veggies instead of something fried. Overall: mediocre. Didn't try the sushi."}
{"text":"The yellow tail melts in your mouth and all the sushi is REALLY fresh. The ginger salad dressing is great and they bring you plenty of it.  They don't mind bringing you extra dishes and napkins.  The staff is outstanding. Erica was our waitress last time but they're all fantastic.  They're always nice to our 1.5yr old son and they promptly take dishes to help us keep food out of his reach.  Our only complaint is that there's no changing table in either bathroom so we usually take him out to the car to change him."}
{"text":"Ive been coming here every now and then for the past year and theyve improved a lot. Their sushi used to be sloppy and not made with care but I came here recently and its better, their chicken bento box is great too with noodles.
Sometimes they run out of ingredients for the rainbow roll (which is my favorite roll )and it tastes plain.
 and I feel sometimes with the right ingredients it still has no flavor :(
another thing, they need to stay on top of things, because I went there and there were no utensils or chopsticks or soy sauce packets and when I asked he said they were there... uh no.

But I definitely recommend the hawaiian roll if you like spicy food."}
{"text":"Came here for the sushi and was sorely disappointed. I live in the area and this would have been very convenient for me. While the price was good, my sushi smelled and tasted unpleasantly fishy."}
{"text":"Sakura now serves ramen!  They offer miso, tonkatsu and shoyu.  Each bowl is $5.95.  There are also several options to add to your meal including more chashu, boiled egg, chicken teriyaki, tempura etc.  I believe the add-ons ranged from $0.50 to $2.00.

The ramen isn't the best I've ever had, but so far it's the best item I've had on their menu.  I ordered the shoyu ramen and added a boiled egg.  It comes with the usual fixings, green onion, ginger, bamboo and a slice of chashu.  The pork is tender, the broth isn't too salty and the noodles were decent.  Again, not the best ever but you're getting a good portion for $6.

The service has also improved from last time.  The cook was churning out teriyaki combos one after another and orders were called by the receipt number.  Faster and more accurate service!  For those days where I just need a bowl of soup for lunch (winter is coming after all!) I can see myself coming back for their ramen."}
{"text":"Parking was easy as we decided to just pop in here because we didnt feel like cooking. 
This is one of those ubiquitous strip mall Asian restaurants that provide a mash-up to appeal to the broadest audience. Margarita specials were on the board near the entrance. (Yep, margaritas!)
We ordered combinations of raw fish and then an Americanized roll (cream cheese infused).
Nothing was horrid, but nothing was amazing, but then again, I didn't try the Margaritas. Service was efficient and effective."}
{"text":"I generally come here for the Bibimbap and haven't really tried out too much of their sushi items because sushi generally tends to be just so expensive. 

The service (which can be rushed due to the sheer amount of students during lunch hour) is really friendly when you have a moment to chat with them. I think their cooked meal portions are very reasonable and their take out is pretty darn decent as well.

It isn't the prettiest restaurant in the world and I'm not too surprised to see another reviewer comment on the cleanliness of the place. While I personally haven't found anything to worry about, it is an old place that could do with some rennovating. 

As for prices... Well I naively believed that being on campus meant a reduction in food prices. Oh dear, no. But if I was to compare the price of the items here to downtown Toronto, then yes the prices are pretty decent. 

In summary, I look forward to eating here again because I honestly I think their food is pretty darn tasty."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Sakura several times and this is one of my favorite restaurants to come to and eat. It can be a little pricey, depending on what you get, but it is very good!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. They have installed a very large tv as their menu, which is great to look at. Have a good variety of different Japanese items, from sushi to teriyaki to ramen, The ramen was very very good, especially for the price. It is definitely authentic with a nice broth and amazing noodles. Will definitely be visiting more often."}
{"text":"The set up is casual, you order at the register and then they bring you the food. Came here instead of the Chipotle next door because coworker didn't like chipotle (who doesn't like chipotle!? But that's another story for another time), and I really wish I had insisted on going there.... Or the many establishments that are a lot better. 

Food was horrible. I had the teriyaki chicken combo, and tried coworker's sushi roll. It was like the sushi you would get at a buffet. The teriyaki chicken was terrible as well. Never again!!!!!"}
{"text":"Teriyaki Madness I am so so so sorry for betraying you and branching out. I had the Teriyaki Chicken combo here and it had maybe a 1/4 the amount of chicken as teriyaki madness. They chicken was really rubbery and slimey which obviously means no good. The mixed veggie were added as filler and the majority of the meal was white rice. I live right by here but I will just drive the extra mile to get the good stuff for a better price."}
{"text":"Have been here twice and had the same thing:  We had the spicey Maki combo, and the regular Sashimi combo.  Salad and Miso soup were OK.  

The first visit:  the Maki combo was excellent with nice presentation.  Similarly, the Sashimi combo was excellent.  Fresh slices of fish that had almost melt-in-your-mouth texture.  

The 2nd visit:  noticed a different sushi chef.  Maki combo rice was overly done--almost mushy in consistency.  The sashimi was not as fresh with some fishy aftertaste it.


I liked the decor and comfortable atmosphere.  Will return again for sure but hoping it will be more like the first visit."}
{"text":"The food tastes good. But that's about the only positive thing you'll get here. I suggest ordering to go! No smiles, no show. Service was extra slow! Bathrooms were dirty and the restaurant was poorly laid out. We were so dissatisfied, our children LOVE the hibachi show and they simply got nothing. My daughter almost cried when I told her that was it. I DO NOT RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here before and while it used to really rock, I had noticed the quality of the food dropping the last couple of visits. My wife and I tried to go for lunch on Sunday and after the hostess ignored us by talking on the phone and keeping us waiting for a couple of minutes, a waitress finally came over and offered to seat us. They have a long line of banquettes with chairs on the other side of the tables and that is where we like to sit. When we asked the waitress to seat us there, she started to lead us over. Suddenly the \"hostess\" managed to stop her phone call long enough to tell us that we couldn't sit there. She said she had a big party coming in. well there was nobody in there but us at that time, so we just left. I hope their \"big\" party showed up because they lost a $100 guaranteed sale to us. We went down the street to Red Lobster and have a fantastic meal. I have to wonder if Sakura is on the way out?"}
{"text":"I have only had the sushi here and it is top-notch. The futomaki is excellent and the people are always pleasant and friendly. It's nice to go there on a Friday night, sit out on the patio with a couple of those giant sapporo beers, eat some fresh sushi and relax. The next nearest good sushi near this side of town is down in Fairlawn or downtown Cleveland so, if you live nearby it can't be beat."}
{"text":"This place is not good at all. Food was gross and not seasoned well. The shrimp had its red line vein still in it. They are not accommodating to special orders (which you have I make because their menu is bland). 
Decorations are outdated and restaurant is not very clean. Light switches are filthy from being used and not wiped down. 
Do yourself a favor and go to Wasabi or Hibachi Steakhouse a few miles away. It's worth the gas over this place."}
{"text":"I like this place!  It's not a fine dining restaurant.  I describe it as a Japanese Panda Express.  You don't go to Panda Express for quality Chinese food.  You don't go to Sakura for gourmet Japanese.  They prepare your food, box it up, and you eat it there or take it with you.
I have never been disappointed with their sushi.  Is it as good as Sushi Loca?  No.  But then again this is more of a \"fast and quick\" food establishment.  Their rolls taste good, the employees are friendly, the price is great, and the sitting area is clean. I order from them about once a week, twice if I'm craving a roll. Overall, I prefer them over Panda, and I do recommend this place."}
{"text":"Yes it is a fast food version of Japanese food. But that doesn't stop people from eating at mandarin does it? I've tried about 80 percent of the menu and my advice is to just so straight to the chicken Katsu. It's delicious and never disappoints. The beef ribs are good but way to fatty. I'm not paying to discard all that fat."}
{"text":"I use to go here quite often when they first opened, and it was pretty good. But is now so bad that I no longer go. The cooks are dirty, sushi is sloppy and ingredients are not well chilled, and the chicken terriyaki is made with some interesting meat. With so many other options in this plaza, they really need to improve asap to survive!"}
{"text":"Me and my friend went there for dinner. We ordered deluxe teriyaki beef bento, gyoza ( pot stickers ) , and 2 roll of sushi. 10 dollar Bento came with lettuce salad with no dressing and tempura with no tempura sauce. Gyoza also came with no sauce. They are charging close to 5 dollars for non Japanese styled sushi. This is what happens when people don't know Japanese food tries to open up a Japanese restaurant."}
{"text":"Good sushi! Best in Gastonia if you ask me!  I moved to Charlotte but still haven't found a fried rice like theirs that I love!  Have come back a few times just for the rice and appetizers, good sushi too!i love it here and return for the best sushi in town!"}
{"text":"Had the Boat for 3, we should have ordered for 2 because there was too much food for three people.  it's a good problem to have.  

the Sushi is always fresh and the combination/specialty rolls are full of flavor.  For a midwest sushi place, it's really pretty good.  

The staff is always polite and helpful.  i come here about once a month and i will be back next month.  (hopefully sooner)"}
{"text":"When I was little I would come here with my Mom after swimming lessons. We would discuss all the things of importance to my nine year old self over chicken katsu (Japanese fried chicken with terriyaki sauce) and Japanese chicken soup. The katsu was fantastic and my little taste buds coveted that shit like a fat kid covets cake. I'm pretty sure that if I had had the chance to eat there every day, the metaphor would be half-true. The chicken soup is not your mother's chicken soup. Unless she's Japanese, then it's very possible that she would make this. In that case,  is it okay if I invite myself over to your house? The setting of the Grange Mall can be a little grungy at times but that's just part of the charm. Don't bother with the dried out sushi in little styrofoam coffins."}
{"text":"This is my first review of a restaurant, as it usually takes an extraordinary event for me to motivate myself to do so. This is one of those times. 

For the tl;dr version: don't ever eat here, ever. Worst food I've ever had, multiple hairs in mine and my girlfriend's food. 

The long version is as follows. As a Korean, I find it absolutely embarrassing their food is labelled as \"Korean food\". It's Korean food in appearance only; in reality, it's more like a pile of edible material that's used solely for substance, not flavour. It's actually quite amazing how they've managed to make their food look decent, but have absolutely zero flavour. To say this is \"Korean food\" is like saying a piece of old lunch meat between two pieces of mouldy bread is a gourmet burger. 

I ordered curry rice with chicken, my girlfriend ordered tonkatsu. The actual curry itself tastes fine; it tastes just like the prepackaged Ottogi 3-minute curry you get at a Korean supermarket, which is what I assume they used and then charged me 8 dollars for it. They then added \"chunks of chicken\" to it. Props to them for using all of the animal, but when the chicken pieces are cut as if a 5-year-old did it, complete with tendons attached to most of the pieces, maybe you're doing something wrong. 

But that's fine though, I'm generally not picky about food. I will not waste it unless I'm truly disgusted, and this was at least edible. As I was trying to shove the tasteless food into my mouth, I felt a piece of hair between my teeth. As disgusting as it is, I kept eating, trying to ignore that this event happened. Then... another piece of hair. I stopped eating. 

My dish and my girlfriend's dish both had hair in it somehow. I don't know if the \"chef\" is shedding, but it's actually quite impressive to have several pieces of hair fall out in 5 minutes of \"cooking\".

I ordered the kimchi side dish, which tasted great. Of course it would, it's clearly not made in-house and tastes just like the prepared mat kimchi you'd get at Galleria or H-Mart. But guess what happened? I wish I was joking, but a piece of hair was found in the kimchi.

Seriously, the \"chef\" should get their hair situation checked out, it's abnormal to be losing so much hair.

Only go here if you feel like punishing yourself. I'm sorry for being so harsh to the owners, but there's clearly something terribly wrong with their restaurant. It's embarrassing that this is the only Korean food on campus, and I hope that people will not think this is representative of it. I assume it's the owner that's cooking the meal. Please hire an actual chef, if the food is good then you'll have more people coming to your restaurant. But as it is right now, it's a place that no one should ever go to."}
{"text":"If I could give this 0 stars I would. I LOVE Japanese food and so does my husband, and sorry Gastonia but this place is disgusting. I had \"Japanese\" chicken that was fried like German Wiener Schnitzel with some teriyaki dipping sauce and my husband had pecan crusted grouper that was soft and mushy and had no flavor. Worst of all was that this horrible meal cost $60! The sushi roll we had was pretty good, but Thai House has better. If you want Japanese food just go to Saki Express or head to Charlotte."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely horrible and disgusting.

First off the food is not cheap, many authentic korean and japanese restaurants are cheaper and have better quality food.

The food is gross, the rice is dry and the salad is limp. Yes they got the katsu right, but that was the only thing eaten on my plate. The bed of bean sprouts it lays on top of is just sad. They also put some sauce on the rice which sits in a bowl on the counter with a gigantic brush to drip onto the rice. I wonder how old and how long the sauce has been sitting there out in the open.

The cashier/server turned me off from the food the most. Constantly scratching his arms and head and then proceeding to handle the rice, sauce and vinegar...  I used to work in food services and this is a definite no-no. Wash your hands man.

Never coming here again unless I want a san pelligrino, and that is definitely all I'm getting."}
{"text":"The food is very bland with little to no taste at all. Don't waste your time or money if you are looking for a good tasting meal because you won't find it here. However the place is decorated nicely."}
{"text":"I was a little wary on one or two bad reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised. We went in for th lunch all you can eat and it was really good. The portions are small but you can ask for more or they ask you how many pieces. the only thing I had a problem with is they say if you order it you have to eat it. On almost eveythign this was great, and understandable. But one sushi roll, I think the volcano was very doughy and I was not a fan so I did not want to finish it but I woudl have been charged if we did not. I woudl perter the Shumi to be steamed, a lot of stuff like the dumplings were fried rather than steamed but next time I will ask. The best part of all was the bill, much less than it woudl have been elsewhere. The staff is super sweet. Loved the udon and we will be back to try the dinner. There was one guy who kept walking in and out. That was odd(if you going to check to makes sure all is well, ask the customers and say hello), but besides that everything was good"}
{"text":"We were just passing through on our way to Boone, NC and decided to check this place out. Our waiter was friendly and fast which we appreciated because we were really hungry. We both went with the miso soup and ginger salad, but both were unimpressive. My boyfriend ordered the shrimp bento box which comes with: grilled shrimp, Krab salad, California roll and rice. I decided to go with the Hawaiian roll which ended up being extremely good. The shrimp was also very flavorful and we were both content with what we ordered. I'd probably go back for the sushi alone."}
{"text":"I am deeply saddened to learn that Sakura is closed. I had a few good memories here. It was a lot better than Bob's Big Boy or whatever the hell. I would much prefer the cute little waving cat statues out front as opposed to the stupid fat boy holding a tray or whatever with his greased back hair. Unfortunately, some people do not share these same feelings. I remember walking past Sakura, drunk, late at night a few times and noticing that some asshole spray painted a red stripe on the cat. These feelings of mine have been hurt by this. It was so sad to see that a peaceful, cute and friendly cat statue would provoke someone to think \"Hey, there goes a super cute and inviting statue, I am going to ruin it!\". This just speaks volumes of our society and the pieces of shit that exist who shouldn't. The government gives us too much freedom. They should mandate vasectomy or at least offer money to do it. There are too many dumb people on the planet having kids, and those kids are growing up savage and spray painting cute things that represent the little bit of good that is left in the world. I relate to Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver when he said \"Some day a real rain will come and wash all the scum off the streets\". I guess that is what brought me to buying rounds of ammo on this hot and balmy Saturday morning."}
{"text":"Do not eat here. I was NOT expecting extreme freshness since we r away in Las Vegas but the sushi rolls are so dry and plastic looking that I feel I was robbed out of my money. Had to go next door for a burrito. :("}
{"text":"Avoid avoid avoid! Tried this place with a friend because the name sounds authentic. The food is not well seasoned. Taste like water with umami preservatives the shrimp are too sad to be on a plate!"}
{"text":"Well after reading less than great reviews we had hoped to find a awesome local place that we loved that would be less then crowded when we got our Japanese cravings.  Sadly this place was less than we hoped, spending 8 years in Japan our standards may have been high but the menu didn't even make us excited.  There was no flavor in the bento boxes, tempura or 'sushi rolls'.  While the food wasn't 'bad' we definitely will not be back no matter how many times we pass it on the way home."}
{"text":"I wasn't blown away by Sakura -- a Japanese spot in the Village by the Grange foodcourt. Tried this place for lunch a few times, but my experience has always been the same. 1) place order with unsmiling girl, 2) wait way too long for said order, 3) \"enjoy\" your meal with chopsticks so cheap they break on the way out of the package. They basically crumbled like Hiroshima. (Eep. Too soon?)

My chicken teriyaki came with tonnes of rice, questionable meat, equally questionable sauce and a few small dry dumplings. A beef teriyaki I had another time wasn't much better. Everything smacked of hasty preparation.

The only saving grace are the prices, which are mercifully low. $4.99 for the lunch special? Not bad. Unless you're a stickler for taste and quality. Which I am. I would avoid.

Obligatory Title Pun: A SAKURA is born every minute.

Menu Readability: Gleefully written in chalk on their board. I dig the flower accents.

Need to mention: They have many soups that I have not tried.

What this place teaches me about myself: While I'm cheap, I'm not that cheap."}
{"text":"I'm not a Japanese food expert by any stretch, but last night's dinner at Sakura missed the mark for this gaijin neophyte.  

My companion and I started with six pieces of sashimi (unagi, tuna and salmon) and a True Love roll.  The fish was very fresh, but the rice was of poor quality, falling apart at the touch and making it difficult to eat.  The roll was lovely to look at, but suffered from a similar lack of structural integrity.

Adding to the difficulty in eating was the fact that the chopsticks provided were pretty much the cheapest I've ever attempted to wield.  They were spindly, uneven and just about impossible for my slightly larger than average hands to wield.

The miso soup had a metallic aftertaste which made it unpleasant after a few spoonfuls. The ginger dressing on the salad was outstanding, though ... a really nice touch.

The entrees were a bright spot, though!  My date had the pecan-crusted grouper, and while that's certainly not a classic Japanese dish it was quite tasty. I had tuna seared rare, and while it was definitely more on the medium-rare side it was still buttery-soft and delicious.

The prices are pretty steep compared to similar restaurants in the area, but it would still be an option for a movie night."}
{"text":"This place is fine but not great. Lots of old-school Chinese on the menu, probably to help with local clientele. Dining room is lovely. Food is bland and service (on 2 separate visits) has been rocky. Prices are very high for what it is. This doesn't hold a candle to other Japanese places I've been."}
{"text":"Sushi was great but absolutely the worst service ever no napkins on the table restaurant was not busy at all but dirty tables everywhere. No music in the dining room what was playing was radios in the kitchen food comes and no knife to cut chicken. Had to go get my own napkins from the bar to wipe my mouth"}
{"text":"Everyone is on the hype of Sushi Rocks, but if you want a nice night out with some great sushi, here it is.  It is very reasonably priced. 

We sat at the table section but they also have a hibachi section and a sushi bar.  The service was quick and there's a lot to choose from.

From the outside you would never guess how wonderful it is in the inside.  Pretty big and nicely decorated. You can go here with a group or just have a quiet night out for two.  There is a parking lot behind or parking in front.  The fact that it's right in the middle of Lakewood does make it nice.  So basically this place is a hidden gem, definitely try it out."}
{"text":"Very surprised to find such a good sushi restaurant in Gastonia."}
{"text":"Tried this place out rather than going to one of our much further away usual sushi spots. We were pleasantly surprised. The service was beyond reproach which is very unusual for us (we are constantly plagued with servers from Hades). He was attentive, well spoken, personable, and on point. The sushi was excellent and it came out very fast especially given that we were there on a Saturday night. We spoke with the owner for a few minutes and he was also well spoken, friendly, and was actually engaged in the conversation. All in all, it was a great experience and will certainly be back to try some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"Listen this place doesn't seen legit but the food surprised me.  Whoever owns this place clearly is not a businessman but once we got our food both my wife and i, who are sushi snobs, loved it.  Would eat here again.  Just ignore the ambiance if you can."}
{"text":"Just an all around good place to eat. The sushi, the ramen, the food from the hibachi grill and lots of other thins to choose from is all good. Sakura is a regular stop for both my family and when out with friends. If you're looking for a quiet spot to have lunch or dinner this is it."}
{"text":"I have lived in Gaston county for most of my adult life and I'm sad to say I've never eaten at this place until now.  Boy was I surprised!  Excellent sushi!  Best sushi I've had anywhere around here and they were kid friendly too!  AND free WiFi!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I found the food here very good. The red dragon roll was great as well as the teriyaki steak.  I would come back to eat at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Love this place I come here every chance I get... Good portion and a great price service is always fast and they are nice. I recommend this place to everyone :)"}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly good. Their sushi was fresh, and you really can't expect more for this area. Unless you go into Charlotte, this is about the only place in town, besides one other smallish place that I always can't seem to find. They had good variety and the prices are more than fair. 

If for some reason you find yourself out in Gastonia, first ask yourself, why? Secondly, get some sushi here."}
{"text":"A great place for a weekday work lunch. Cheap prices, fast service, and quite reasonable portions. You can get a teriyaki bento for $6.50 or a sashimi don for just under $7.00. The quality isn't quite as good as the neighboring Manpuku, but it's more than sufficient for a rushed lunch. Grab a bento from here, the $1.99 special at the adjacent bubble tea shop, and you have yourself a cheap and cheerful meal."}
{"text":"Food was ok, small amounts of meat mostly rice and half cooked veggies. Horrible service."}
{"text":"The service is really good here. My boyfriend, family and I have been here twice and was pleased each visit. We have been searching for a very long time for a good restarant and this spot is good. We are happy to spend our money here. 
Our server was Trey for the second time and he is great with the details on the menu and was very friendly and funny. 
The spicy tuna is my favorite dish. How I usually rate sushi restaurants is that if the spicy tuna roll isnt good than everything isnt great. Their spicy tuna roll is really good and so everything else was great as well.
  I highly recommend trying this restaurant out. 
:) Thanks for the good sushi guys!"}
{"text":"I usually don't post on Facebook or Yelp but something happened yesterday that needs to be read. My daughter and I went to a restaurant called Sakura located at 2520 E. Craig Rd in Las Vegas. After ordering some sushi and fried rice, 3 bites into it we both ran to the bathroom vomiting. The cashier apparently thought everything was fine and refused to give us a refund even though what we ordered was still on the table minus about 3 bites. Stay away!!!!!!!!"}
