{"text":"Love love love it..... Al pastor is bomb not huge on the ground beef empanadas are life.... Over all great"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service! We came in a few minutes before they stopped serving and the guy at the front gave us great service and recommend these amazing nachos. You definitely get what you pay for and more. A huge plate of nachos with fresh guac and other toppings, it was delicious! Highly recommend it to everyone !"}
{"text":"The empanadas are yummy! Had to give credit but my food wasn't great at all... Bad service too so not a good experience at all!!!!"}
{"text":"Thumbs up for the habanero salsa, hot as it should be!
Thumbs down for the corn tortillas used for tacos: tortillas shouldn't be sweet, completely demerits the taste of their protein. you need to up your game on this and use real tortillas, not the ones fro the plastic bag, use the ones from the ones with the paper wrapping!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, good service and great prices. Definitely looking forward to going back and trying other options on the menu. The taco salad was loaded with flavor and tons of protein. The perfect combination. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, fast service. Not the cleanest or nicest looking establishment though. 

You order at the counter, pay and choose your own seat. 

They have a complimentary salsa bar which is nice.

I wished the small guacamole came with chips. We ordered the large to get the chips and it ended up going to waste. 

I would go here again for a yummy quick bite to eat. I wouldn't go here for a dinner out though. It's set up like a very casual pizza place. We stopped here in between brewery hopping."}
{"text":"Delicious food!  Huge portions.  Not too pricey.  There's no dedicated parking...only street parking.  Great management and kitchen staff.  Great for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Like the new location.  Same great product. Met the manager/owner and he was very friendly"}
{"text":"Just found this place in Charlotte and it's my new favorite Mexican restaurant . Love it . It's very authentic and you can taste all the different flavors with each bite !! I tried the shrimp tacos and taco salad so far with side of guac and everything was delicious ! I can't wait to try more things on the menu . Will be back  . Oh and don't forget to check out salsa bar it's the best part ."}
{"text":"I didn't expect much going in.... but damn. Everything we ordered was delicious. The beer selection is awesome. They have other options for non drinkers. You HAVE to get the corn if you don't get anything else. 

This place is WAY better than it's next door neighbor...."}
{"text":"Sabor is one of my favorite fast casual places. The contents of the tacos, and bowls are so fresh! I love that they offer corn tortillas, or flour. Personally i like the corn tortilla (Authenticos), but that is just me. They build your own bowl is also pretty sweet, as the cashier will swing their computer screen around to allow you to choose the contents yourself. A minor detail that I appreciate tremendously especially when the line is out the door. Grab a Colombiana soda for a change with your meal! Great atmosphere, great workers!"}
{"text":"Great little taco place!  If you're in NODA, definitely check it out.  The nachos are highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Great food, awesome customer service! They even gave me their wi-fi!!!! Strongly Recommended place to eat with family and friends."}
{"text":"This is probably one of our favorite fast casual restaurants in Charlotte. It's a bit dangerous since we live in the neighborhood- I think we go at least once a week. Their beef empanadas are really good. The steak nachos plate is HUGEEE and delicious (my husband and I always split one and can never finish it). Also, their guacamole is one of the best in Charlotte!!  My husband never liked guac until he had it for the first time at Sabor. 

One thing we found a bit odd was the young lady at the register did not know how to make a frozen margarita. Not a big deal but I just prefer frozen over on the rocks. 

Overall, we love the atmosphere and food. Whenever we drive by it is always packed, which its a great thing for a business. It would be great if they could expand in the back and have a patio for the summer time."}
{"text":"This place is entirely adequate.  I came here for Mexican food and I wasn't disappointed.  

I ordered a medium sized guacamole to share and a burrito.  The guacamole had excellent flavor and came with more than enough chips.  I was actually surprised at how much guacamole I was served.  

My burrito was also excellent.  The portion was a wee bit bigger than I'd have liked but that isn't a bad problem to have.  

They also featured an extensive salsa bar.  I was really impressed by the jalapeno pineapple salsa.  The also had the red and green salsas white people appropriating cultures had come to expect.  

What I wanted was a simple lunch like Qdoba or Chipotle.  The only thing I didn't like was that they had stuffed so many tables in that it was hard to move around.  Also, it was noisy but I'm not holding it against a restaurant that parents put their kids at other tables and scream at them from across the room."}
{"text":"Location not hard to find. Nice layout. Would like a couple more salsa selections on the bar. Alcohol will be added soon. Manager told me how different things  were made. I.really liked my food thus the reason for no food pics!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! What a fantastic experience!! Everything we got to eat was delicious and tasted authentic. The prices were very reasonable, the atmosphere enjoyable and the service quick and friendly. If I find myself in Charlotte again I will be paying this place a visit for sure!!"}
{"text":"Quick lunch. We went in Taco Tuesday so the tacos were $1 each. Chips and queso are a must, very delicious! Got the corn and was kind disappointed...flavor was ok. The cheese like sauce that is on the corn was a little too much for me, I ended up having to scrap the majority of it off to eat the corn. Overall God's, would def go back."}
{"text":"Good food but ordering takeout or delivery is a total crapshoot. They've screwed up the last two times we've ordered delivery via postmates. Wrong items, missing items, etc. Plus they will not answer their phone to make things right."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and We were just stopping to get our daughter some food. 

We got a small side of rice and beans and plantains.
First, the small sides come in the little cups that you get the sauces in. What? I've never in my life seen a small side given in those little cups. I was literally in awe. Clearly my bad for not asking.
Second the beans tasted like they just added a tablespoon of salt in that little cup to the beans. Holy salty. The saltiest food I've ever had. Not an exaggeration. And the rice was super dry and ehhh.

We also ordered a side of plantains and it came with cheese on top. We don't eat cheese. It doesn't specify that there is cheese on the menu so we asked for a new one. I think it should state there cheese comes on them. They were good though

All in all we were super dissapinted and that was just for sides."}
{"text":"So, so food!! 

Nothing like the one off independence blvd. 

Arepa- too crunchy on the outside, cold cheese, and some kind of red sauce. It was nothing like the perfectly toasted, melted cheese inside arepa we had at the other place. 

Yuca fries- hit or miss. Some were dry and some moist. At the other place they were the most supple yet crunchy on the outside amazing! 

Veggie empanada- too much grease and moisture on the inside. It busted open. It was ok tasting, but hard to get past the grease. 

Chips- Not great, but not the worst I've had. They were free, so that part was pretty good. 

Water- nice big cups for free!"}
{"text":"This place is a little small but a great stop right along the side walk in NoDa. The staff seem friendly and the menu is good! I got tacos and if you check in on Yelp right now you get a free basket of chips! Woohoo! The tacos were good and my boyfriends burrito was also good! They have specials daily and drinks as well. I think this is a good spot to hit on a hot day for some good and quick Mexican/ Latin food! Pretty clean as well! I recommend trying all the salsas!"}
{"text":"Not a satisfying food experience at all. Cheap tables and chairs are kinda pushed together. Order while standing at the cash register and then get hit up for the 25-30% tip while you're still standing there. They push the ipad at you with the tips all ready to get signed up for. 

Next step, go sit down. They call your number and you hop right up and fetch your own food from the pickup area then go sit back down. Get your own self serve fountain drinks and get your own self serve sauces, and then go sit back down. 

The latin street taco, for instance, is very small with a small spoonful of chicken on it. Please feel free to get up and fetch yourself some sauce so its not so awfully dry and flavorless. No employee will come by your table for any reason ever, after you have sat down. Remember that 25 -30% tip they shamed you into when you were paying your bill at the end of the ordering process?

Sucker! You end up doing everything for yourself. 

You may not enjoy eating your meal off of wax paper with plastic forks, but it's all in good latin street fun. Sabor means flavor or taste. Remember this when your trying to choke down some of that bland, dryish \"street food\".

Go next door, they have much better everything."}
{"text":"The food was delicious but the cashier failed to inform us of what tacos were $1 on taco tuesday. I thought especially for a first time patron that's something I woild have wanted to know or seen posted. Needless to say my bill was quite pricey. It's a very small dining area so not much room to sit and dine in. As we were finishing up...still sitting at the table one of the staff members just started wiping our table. She didn't say excuse me or ask if we were done. I thought that wS quite rude!!"}
{"text":"The shredded chicken taco salad is my favorite  .... the Elote Loco is fantastic ... good food every time ... and the prices are right !!!"}
{"text":"Tried Sabor for the first time on Wednesday. It was so incredible!! Came back for lunch Friday!! 
It's a great little hole-in-the-wall place with food that will blow your mind!  Service was great too. I'm so excited to go back again soon! The appetizer (can't remember what it's called) with french fries, steak, quack quacamole and a few more ingredients is outstanding!!"}
{"text":"This new Latin grill is pretty delicious. I went last week and got a burrito bowl and all the flavor was delicious! They do not short you on the guac which great! On Saturday they have 1/2 off craft beer and their prices are very reasonable before the 1/2 off! So great deal! 

We then went on Tuesday for taco Tuesday. They were good but I wasn't blown away. I got shredded chicken and beef. They were served in a corn tortilla and it was very messy! My taco kept falling apart. They come with onions, lime, and cilantro. They had a great flavor to them, but I'll probably go somewhere else for taco Tuesday. 

I will 100% go back to try new things though! I saw someone order the nachos and empanada and my mouth started watering! It looked so so delicious! 

They have an average amount of seating but both times it has been 100% packed! But it is worth it to wait and find a place to eat. So I recommend this place if you are looking for some Latin food for sure!"}
{"text":"Genius!  The perfect restaurant for the area.  Great quick food at reasonable prices.  I love the fact that they have avocado quinoa bowls now too, a great way to put something healthy on your stomach before I night out drinking.

I'm not gonna lie, I havn't been a fan of Cabo Fish Taco for quite some time.  The quality has fallen off a little, while wait is longer and longer.  So having another spot to get tacos is more than welcome.  Don't get me wrong, I will still go to Jack Beagles for a wrap or mac and cheese, I'll still go to Growlers for some apps, and I'll still go to Boudreaux's or the public house for a more sit down experience.  But all that said, this place serves a niche that has been needed to be filled for quite some time.

I guess I should talk more about the food and booze.  I started writing this assuming everyone had been to the other location.  This restaurant is part of the 3 Amigo's and Salud beer shop family.  Anybody looking for basic Mexican food should be able to find something to make their heart content, but there is so much more.  Think more Central and South American street food.  Arepas, gorditas, empanadas, as well as your basic tacos and burritos.  Everything is good and reasonably priced.

On top of all this, they have a great beer selection.  I mean REALLY great, like probably better than any other Mexican restaurant in NC.  Stone, Ballast point, and tons of local beers.

I'll be back, many times over and over."}
{"text":"First time in North Carolina, and blown away by how good this place is. Chips and salsa with the quesadilla is amazing. You get to choose from about 8 different salsa types. Ranging in spicy scale. The quesadilla is 695 and I barely could finish it because it's so big."}
{"text":"Second time at this location and I absolutely love it here. I got the epic protein bowl with chicken and omg my new favorite. Me and my family really enjoy this place. I love the environment, service and wait time."}
{"text":"visited today for the first time and is was incredible. Beautiful and clean restaurant, ladies at the register were super nice and cool. I got the traditional Tacos and they were unbelievable. So glad they decided to open in Noda."}
{"text":"I ordered the Arepa and ground beef Empanada combo, added Pico and an avocado. The arepa & empanada combo is $6 on Thursdays. It was so good! The meat was well seasoned and the pastry had a nice golden brown color with the right amount of crisp. This is my second time trying Sabor and I believe I like it better than 3 Amigos now. I also tried the green monster, pinapple habanero salsa, both gave the right amount of heat and spice. The pineapple habanero was sweet and a kick of spice. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"I am a Sabor fan and have been to most locations. It is 5-star fast casual food. I don't think I have yet to have an item that I don't like here. The tacos autenticos are my usual go to as are the nachos (which are HUGE so share). Try the al pastor tacos for a real treat. They also have a great selection of canned and bottled beer, including local crafts. 

I knocked this review down a star to 4 for this location. Its not the food by any means. I get this location is super busy. I have just had a few experiences where the staff seems flustered, food takes longer, and the dining area/bathroom seems messy/not very clean."}
{"text":"Hello, Sabor. Welcome to the new 'hood. 

This new Sabor location is, IMO, a lot better than their Elizabeth one. Feels like there's twice as many tables/chairs, even though I'm sure I'm exaggerating. 

As always, Sabor doesn't disappoint. $1 #TacoTuesday is the long standing real MVP. I just learned this, but they'll let you \"upgrade\" to the premium tacos for an additional $1 (thus, making the \"premiums\" $2/each). 

I've tried all of the regulars, as well as the Al Pastor. Personally, I think the ground beef and shredded chicken are the best. I wasn't impressed with the al pastor in the least bit. I'm a queso kinda guy ... so this would be my \"must improve\" item for Sabor. I've gotten it 3 times, and 2 of the 3 times it's been extremely thin/runny. It always takes the same (I guess that's a plus), but I much  prefer it when it's thicker. The mo' cheese on a chip, the better. 

Protip: Taco Tuesday is also valid for take out."}
{"text":"I brought the cordita with the shrimp not what I  expected  very small portion with five pieces of shrimp which I was charged extra $2 for very disappointed."}
{"text":"Loved it. We stopped for a quick lunch. I got two tacos autentico with shredded chicken. And my gosh that shredded chicken was amazing! I also loved the salsa bar, yess choices."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Great tastes, fun locale and atmosphere...and the prices can't be beat! The fish tacos (less than $4!!!) are phenomenal. The nachos....YUM! I wish there was one closer to me in Quail Corners (hint hint to the owners!)  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place one night in NoDa and boy oh boy was I in for a treat. If you're looking for fast service, a good portion of food, delicious food of course, and a mean margarita, alllll for a super reasonable price. Sabor Latin Street Grill is the move. Loved this place! And honestly, it was perfect for a casual little date night, nothing fancy, just great food and good vibes."}
{"text":"Awesome new spot in Noda! Great food! Love the build your own bowl and burrito options!"}
{"text":"Great food - love the casual atmosphere! The food is fresh and authentic. My husband goes for Taco Tuesday quite often!"}
{"text":"I usually love this place! Today however was a disappointment. Seemed like everyone else in the Resturant was pretty upset too. Waited 40 minutes for my order which wasn't big either....."}
{"text":"Nice spot, definitely better than Cabo fish taco and the fact that it's next door is pretty hilarious to me.  This was my first time there and it was cool experience.   My hot bf was in the mood for seafood and he ordered the EPIC PROTEIN BOWL (for his \"gains\" hehehe) and he got extra shrimp and tilapia and it was pretty tasty.  

I got the taco salad with grilled chicken and Mexican rice (bc quinoa gets stuck in my teeth) and it was delicious.  They even took the time to turn on the NBA All Star Game  great gesture.  And the halved avocado was fresh AF! I'm a stickler about my avocados....it was lovely.

I didn't give 5 stars bc the Pineapple Harbenero salsa lacked flavor.   I was pretty let down."}
{"text":"My friends and I had a terrible experience at this location about 2 months ago- they got all out our orders wrong, took forever to bring them out, and acted indignant when we requested that our orders be remade. I ordered a burrito without cheese or sour cream as I am allergic to dairy, and it came out with both. When I brought up I was asked if I wanted them to remake it and when I said yes, the woman behind the line snatched my plate and later we could hear her slamming things around angrily. Hawthorne is basically the only good location I have been to."}
{"text":"Always so good. There's no way to go wrong here. Elote is probably my favorite but it's definitely not healthy.... dollar taco deal is always awesome. The quinoa bowl is even good! There's a large selection of beer (good beer choices run in this family, they're related to the folks at Salud I hear) and the staff is always friendly. Sometimes they're a little short on seating but it usually clears out quickly. Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Love sabor, love tacos, love food. Great deals on Tuesday, 1.00 tacos, best spot to go to eat these in Charlotte!! Good guac and chips as well!"}
{"text":"I have been to Sabor on N. Tryon. But this is more homey and more of a hangout than the location on Tryon. Tryon locAtion is a bit commercialized. 

I ordered the fish tacos. It was ok. But I was sure it was even a fish taco. Too busy talking. And of course you have to have the Mexican corn. Sooo yummy. That's all I can say!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Sabor and I hope it's not my last:) NoDa seemed like a very hip little area where I wouldn't mind hanging out given the opportunity.

Salsa! I loved the salsa bar here. My favorites were the salsa verde as well as the pineapple salsa. The pineapple salsa had a kick to it, so it had twinges of sweet and hot playing off of one another. Chips (free with Yelp check-in when I was there) were fresh and crisp. 

I ordered the Especial Burrito with chicken and Spanish rice. It wasn't filled with 90% rice, which is always an annoyance. Instead, there was an ample amount of chicken and beans. Very fresh hint of lime flavor. For the size of the burrito, I'd say the pricing was fair. I left stuffed."}
{"text":"Great food. Quick and friendly service. BEST. SALSA. We were very excited that our favorite little Latin restaurant was popping up in NODA just as we were moving in. Yay!"}
{"text":"I can't say better things about a restaurant as I will about Sabor. First, the location is amazing in Noda, the cutest little area I have seen on my travels.

Second, everyone was super nice, and they have extra sauces...how could you not love it.

But, far more importantly, was the FOOD. I had the Carne Asada Fries, and an arepa. The arepa was good, but coming from Norwalk where I get the best quality arepas around, they weren't worth 5 start. BUT, the Fries - perfectly cooked potatoes covered with immense-flavored steak, and covered in cheese, sauces, and other great toppings - now THAT was what I was looking for on this culinary journey. They delivered in every aspect of this meal, and it was something I went back to a second time, even though I was here for only a few days.

If that isn't indicative of how well Sabor did for my palette, then I am not sure what is."}
{"text":"Always a favorite in Noda. Great food and great salsa! I just wish they had a separate line for take out order pick ups. Doesn't do much good to order take out when you have to wait in line out the door to pick up."}
{"text":"Looking for solid, cheap Latin food? Highly recommend Sabor's Taco Tuesday, nestled in the heart of hipster NoDa. Short wait times, with quick seating no matter how long the line. $1 tacos (recommend beans and beef ones) could not be more economical. Elote loco (best grilled corn-on-the-cob one could ask for) to top it off. Be sure to sign up for that free side of chips!"}
{"text":"To be totally honest I was very underwhelmed with the food here. The black bean taco was flavorless. No seasonings, lime, anything.  The quinoa bowl with \"grilled vegetables\" was not what I expected. Their vegetables consisted of a small amount of diced onion and green bell pepper. Chips and queso were good but let's be real you can get that anywhere."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. The authenticos tacos are delicious. The queso dip is always so good and the margaritas are great. Neat little place and have already been back multiple times."}
{"text":"The line was out the door even at 8:30pm for Taco Tuesday.

Menu jackpot- swap the fries (which I haven't had and could rock) for plantains in the carne asada app.

Plantains smothered in gauc, cheese, carne asada - I had to fight my husband's fork away.

Other high points include the much loved salsa bar and killer beer selection."}
{"text":"The carne asada fries were delicious. We shared them and it was enough for both of us. We also tasted the arepa and empanada that Danny ordered and they were excellently seasoned and very delicious. The Special $4 monitor was also refreshing and tasty. 
I will be back."}
{"text":"Highly recommend Carne asada fríes and fried plantains. Nice cozy place in NoDa. Nice selection of beers."}
{"text":"$1 taco Tuesday! They offer a ground beef or shredded chicken taco on soft corn for $1. Dress them up at their salsa bar. Don't skip the guac. It's good stuff."}
{"text":"After being very impressed with my first visit to a Sabor last week, I had to give the closest one to my house a \"whirl.\" The food was as good as I had hoped, but the people just aren't the same as the guys at Steele Creek.

Ordered take out, it was at least 10 tacos (had to share the magic with the peeps at home). I got some in Al Pastor in Americanos, Authenticas, and Locos styles. We also got some with shrimp and some with chicken. The Tacos are as good as they get but my favorite is still the Al Pastor. It's cooked with pineapple and onion and works so well with the most tender pork I've ever had at a restaurant.

The service however, could be a bit better. While ordering, the man at the counter didn't say much besides clarifying which tacos would be included in Taco Tuesday and which I would have to pay extra for. Other than that I didn't get a \"Thank You\" or anything really. The vibe isn't very friendly here, and honestly it didn't seem like the counter staff wanted to be there. Before I left I asked the woman who called my name with my order if they had the Taco \"Cream Sauce\" that I got from the Steele Creek store and she bluntly said \"We're Out\" after already turning around.

A couple of pros is that it's good food, as good as the first visit, and it's very reasonably priced. Somewhat disappointed as I would probably be a twice a week customer at minimum. Fortunately, the South Charlotte and Pineville restaurants are close to my office."}
{"text":"Love the new Sabor location! And bonus- it's slightly less crowded than the Elizabeth location. I mean I came here at prime time (7pm) for taco Tuesday and didn't have to fight for a table. 

If you've been to Sabor before you know the Shabang, but for you newbies this joint is the place to go for authentic tacos in Charlotte. Plus they offer $1 tacos on Tuesday including dine in and carry out. $1 tacos include chicken, beef, veggie and black bean (served on corn tortillas). Plus, free chips with your checkin. Not many places can offer that. 

Need salsa? Have no fear! Sabor offers a free salsa bar with a verity of different salsas. My favorites are the jalapeño pineapple and their medium salsa. Great on the chicken taco. The jalapeño green salsa is also delicious to put into their cheese dip. Trust me- you will thank me later."}
{"text":"El Dominicano 
flat grilled burrito filled with shredded chicken, sauteed cabbage, onion, tomato, finished with rosada sauce

I will return and try various items on their menu, they serve \"mi kinda gravy!\" The burrito fell apart in my mouth = no arguments."}
{"text":"This is a great addition to the NoDa n'hood - fast, casual, delicious food. 

When you walk by Sabor, don't be alarmed if you see a line out the door - the line moves very quickly.  You stand in line initially to place your order - you'll then pick it up a few minutes later once it's prepared.    They offer a wide variety of latin street food - I really like the taco salad and burritos.  Their guacamole is super-tasty with large chunks of fresh avocado throughout - grab the large to share.  

Once you place your order, check out the salsa bar in the back.  The salsas are arranged in order of heat - the further to the right you go, the more beer/soda you're going to need to quench that fire!  

Every Tuesday is $1 taco night.  Unless you're just dying for $1 tacos (order at least 3), I'd recommend skipping this night.  Tuesday's are super-busy and really the tacos aren't the best things on their menu."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Typically go to next door (Cabo Fish Taco) but they were full so I stopped in and this is my new lunch spot.  Nachos were amazing and the all the salsas were to die for.  NODA has lots of great places but this is one of the best"}
{"text":"Husband and I are here on out first night in Charlotte as our Airbnb was right above it. The place seems to be a popular spot so we went on in. Friendly face greeted us as we walked up to register. I ordered some carne asada fries and husband got an empanada and a taco.

I loved my food as it was topped with a bunch of cheese, meat, and avocados. A happy triad of yummy for me! Husband was not as thrilled of his empanada, but enjoyed his taco. We each ordered a   soda bottle and missed the bottle opener on the wall. A sympathetic worker noticed our plight and opened them for us.

Overall, it's a nice neighborhood joint that serves fresh food quick. What impressed me the most was the people working here and how nice they all are

Side note: Just wanted to give a shout out to Erik - one of the guys that works here. He noticed that we were having car trouble and offered to help when he could easily have gone about his day. Without him and his dad (a mechanic), we probably wouldn't have made it home as fast we did. Some real southern hospitality! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Soo I'm just gonna put this out there up front: I wasn't impressed. If I had known I was gonna spend $14.00 on bland Elote and barely warm fries (Carne fries) I would have saved my carb splurge for Cabo Fish Taco next door. Like I hate when I go to places and ask the staff about the food and they lie and say it's amazing except it's not. 

customer service-no complaints EXCEPT you have to order and pay at the counter before seating yourself. This would otherwise be fine EXCEPT they prompt you to leave a tip upfront but you receive NO personalized service. You have to retrieve your own food from a counter when your name is called, retrieve your own drinks and refills and condiments, and clear away your trash. Why and who am I tipping?!

Atmosphere-nothing special but there's free wifi and gender neutral bathrooms #win *shrugs*

Food-chile bye! I'm not even Latin and my Street Corn tastes better!   Added some of the Mexican hot sauce for as much flavor as your going to get on that thing. I was really disappointed with the fries though. They were undercooked and not seasoned at all and luke warm. Like I can't really say anything else about them. 

Value-idk. I just feel like $14.00 for flavorless food is not a go in my book. I'm not sure if I'll return. 

Overall I was hoping for much more but sadly all I got was calories that I didn't even enjoy consuming."}
{"text":"Amazing place!! Ate my tacos too fast to take a picture of... but the grilled shrimp \"authentic tacos\" w/ flour tortillas ???? Clutch. I eat it almost every week during lunch! Plus the free chips upon check in is too perfect! Daily food & drink specials... two thumps up!!"}
{"text":"Two words. Taco Tuesday. But even if you don't go on a Tuesday for cheap tacos, the rest of their menu is awesome too! There's usually a line out the door, but it moves quickly. I've never had anything I didn't like off the menu, sooo I basically recommend everything. Their salsa bar is really nice and the staff is always cool and friendly. They have limited seating outside, but a decent amount inside. It's also right next to Cabo Taco, so it's a nice and cheap alternative."}
{"text":"got the protein bowl with chicken and an arepa..different arepa than I'm used to but it was delicious none the less."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I really haven't had a bad meal there. My first meal was something on a corn tortilla. That was my fault b/c I hate corn tortilla but the filling was awesome. My latest trip there I had 2 ground beef tacos and 1 shrimp taco. They were so good and so much filling I could barely closed the taco. I was so stuff that I couldn't even eat what I spilled out on my plate. My wife order the nacho with stake. I was so much she want me to help eat and I couldn't. I love on Friday night margaritas are on special. I love the location I so think the fit Noda. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I order food from Sabor pretty regularly, although mostly from the Elizabeth location (which we've had no complaints with). This past Monday (04/23/18) however, we placed an order online at the Noda location. We both ordered BYOB, one with chicken and one with pork. Neither one of the bowls had ANY rice at all, my husband's was mostly filled with lettuce and had about two spoonfuls of meat. Mine had very little rice (mind you, we did request rice), a bunch of lettuce to make up for the fact that there was barely any rice and just a little bit of chicken. This was the most unsatisfying meal we have ever gotten from Sabor. It would be nice if the people that work there could put a little bit more attention to the meals that they put together."}
{"text":"So good! This place is on my rotation and it will be a favorite of your also. It never disappoints. My goodness the carne asada fries alone are worth going up a size in clothes. But the food goodness doesn't stop there. Any of the arepas will do you in, in the best possible way. Thank you Lord for the empanada's. I know how labor intensive it is to make these well. Now I don't have too. Just GO! You'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"TL;DR Incredible flavor and worth going out of your way for.

Food - 5/5 - I'm always hesitant to give 5's on food, because I always ask, \"is this REALLY as good as it gets?\"  For this type of latin/mexican cuisine, I think it is.  This is my second time here and both times have been phenomenal.  There were three of us in our group, we got three tacos, an arepa, chips, and a side of yuca fries.  Everything had awesome taste.  Tacos were moist and flavorful with a good ratio of meat to topping to tortilla.  Arepa was lightly cripsy on the outside and fluffy on the inside and the protein inside was equally fantastic.  Yuca fries nice and crispy, but not dry like most other yuca fries I've had.  Everything was just fantastic.

Decor/Ambience - 3.5/5 - It's simple and effective.  Very laid back feel with a handful of booths and tables, a serve-your-self salsa bar and drink machine.  

Service - 3/5 - Definitely on the slow side in both my experiences.  This time around they were fulfilling a very large call-in order.  That being said, there was certainly no sense of urgency behind the counter.  Unless I'm feeling a little grumpy, it's not a big deal."}
{"text":"I live right down the street from this Sabor location in NoDa. I've actually only been there for Taco Tuesday before so I have yet to try a variety of menu items. For those that don't know about Taco Tuesday, it's essentially their happy hour special all day - $1 simple tacos with your choice of shredded chicken, ground beef, veggies, or black beans. They have an extensive salsa bar as well. If you check-in with Yelp you can get a free side of chips and get free salsa from the bar, making a pretty cheap Tuesday meal. I did order a side of queso one day to have with my chips and thought it was pretty good.

The tacos aren't really anything amazing, but they are good for what they are. They are basically ONLY the main ingredient without any fixings. Fore example the shredded chicken doesn't come with lettuce, cheese, or anything else. You can use the salsa bar to spruce it up a bit or add some toppings for an additional charge. That being said, I'm a big fan of getting the basic $1 tacos and doing what I can to fancy them up a little with free condiments. You can't beat spending $9 for two people to eat dinner with a fountain drink.

The staff are always friendly and helpful, even when they're slammed with business on Tuesday nights. At that time you can expect to potentially wait about 20 minutes for your food and maybe not get a place to sit right away. Overall I'm giving 4 stars based on my experience with the food thus far. I'll likely branch out from Taco Tuesday in the future and may update my review based on some other food items I try. For now it'll remain a good cheap spot for dinner with tacos that satisfy but don't go too far beyond that."}
{"text":"Great food experience, poor service experience. My wife and I went with friends on a Saturday night, so yes it was busy and yes it was crowded. The guy and gal on the front counter did a great job taking orders quickly and accurately. Everyone ordered and got seated. My wife and I were the last two to order. Food started coming out, the other four people in our party got their food, so we're next - right? 

Well we waited... and waited... and waited... People who had ordered after us were getting their food. The friends we were with were finishing their food. The people were had ordered after us were finishing their food. I went up to the \"window\" and lingered long enough for someone to ask me what was up. I explained the situation and the guy said \"man, it's a Saturday night - you should expect to wait\". Well then. This was already after about 15 minutes. I sat back down and waited another 5-10 minutes and went back up and just stood there until it FINALLY came out. Food was delicious...

I hate when people say this, but I work in the customer service industry, and I have a hard time imagining myself saying to someone that they should expect to wait because we're busy. I know you're busy, I'm really just looking for a \"oh yeah your order is fifth in line, our avocado guy is on the way back from Michoacan with a fresh batch for your guacamole...\" Perfect, I love fresh guac.

I 100% recommend going to Sabor in NoDa and Elizabeth and every other location because their food is great - just a bad experience this time."}
{"text":"Let me start of by saying I am a BIG FAN of SABOR! 
Butttt... This location is just ok to me. If you are in the NoDa location then it is perfect for street taco lovers but I think I will be going to the Hawthorne location for my Autenticos tacos. Everything is the same as far as the menu but my tacos weren't as awesome as they are at Hawthorne. Maybe it was too late for the cooks or maybe it wasn't a good day but I left feeling a little disappointed. The restaurant was very warm inside and I also opted to sitting outside in hopes of feeling a breezy. 
Friday $4 margaritas made this trip a little bit better!"}
{"text":"Since we were driving around Charlotte, we decided to check out this place. I was originally going to Cabo, but decided to just grab a quick meal here in Sabor. I've never heard of this spot and decided to try something new and get something to write for Yelp.

And the verdict was that it wasn't bad! I enjoyed what they had here. The food was fresh and everything came hot right off the grill. If I was hungrier, I would have ordered a burrito or a bigger meal, but we just wanted to try out their tacos so this is what we ordered:

Chorizo Empanada. Americanos with Al Pastor, and the Autenticos tacos. The empanada was bursting with flavor and every bite gave you a mouth full of meat. The tacos were filling as well, and I would say 3 tacos would give you a decent sized meal.

The one bad thing was that I thought the price was a little much. We didn't order that much food, but yet the price was close to $25 for just two people. I think if I were to tell anyone what to eat, it would to be to stay away from the street food of the usual tacos and street food and go for the meals such as the burritos or salads/protein bowls. But, if that's the case then why even go to a Street Food place? I think if you're coming here for a snack or a light appetizer, this will definitely be the place as this is what I will remember it to be."}
{"text":"LEGIT! So that's the word I'll use to describe my experience at Sabor last night in NoDA.  After the Corinne Bailey Rae show my homegirl & I walked in and experienced a few items that are now favorites: Chicken & chorizo empanadas, sweet plantains that were dipped in Cinnamon & Sugar, Arepa and a couple margaritas.  Damn it was all authentic, well seasoned, freshly prepared and reasonably priced. 

The staff was friendly, they continuously came over to the table asking how the food was, any concerns, and clearing the tables. I love this spot, the energy was welcoming."}
{"text":"I love this place, and the staff are so friendly. I have been coming to this location (noda)since they opened, and the food haven't wavered yet. Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"Tacos Americanos with beef are to die for. Great ingredients and absolutely delicious. Chips and queso are very good too. Staff is also super friendly, which is great! When going on Tuesday, be prepared for a MASSIVE line and crowd because of $1 Taco Tuesdays. Still worth it though; very good!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, lots of yummy choices. Quesadilla was huge. Salad was fresh and delicious. Chips were a huge serving. Quest was so good. Both enough for two to share. Clean restaurant to boot. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Favorite taco spot for authentic, fresh tacos ... I absolutely LOVE this place ... the service is fast, they have some of the freshest ingredients ... Taco Tuesdays are everything to me!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! I recommend the Three Amigos burrito and the guacamole. Salsa bar is a plus as well."}
{"text":"This is a smaller location compared to their Hawthorne Ave spot, however, it IS HOT inside. Over the Fourth of July weekend, I had dinner at Cabo and remembered seeing Sabor having posted a sign about their 'broken A/C' and needless to say, it is still broken (or not operating at full capacity).

Thankfully, I picked up my order to-go and only had to briefly endure the stifling indoor heat. I ordered a chicken empanada and elote loco along with a nodajito (half price craft beers on Saturdays!). The menu is the same as at Hawthorne, only the beers are behind the counter at this location.

The salsa bar is tucked away in a corner directly across from the counter where you pick up your food. You are able to scoop some salsa to-go along with your complimentary chips thanks to the yelp check-in!

The staff was plenty pleasant considering the heat and the food was still good. I only wish that the toppings for the elote loco held up better once I arrived home."}
{"text":"This is a good place for quick food and is freshly made.  We got the empanadas and several tacos. 

For the type of food, the price is a little bit on the higher side but I guess that is just because of the NoDa location."}
{"text":"Maybe I just didn't get the right food here.. honestly there was nothing special or that stood out about this place. I would go back to give it another try, but I'm not sure that it would be on the top of my list to go back.."}
{"text":"So after a visit to Birdsong Brewery, we got tired of waiting for Hiya Food Truck to show up and were hungry. So we ventured down the road to Sabor. And on a Friday night, this location was busy.

I was super hungry so I went for the Sabor Especial burrito since I figured it would be more hearty. I had shredded chicken, black beans and brown rice/quinoa and the other toppings that came on it. I think quac and salsa. And I checked in for my order of free chips. They have a variety of salsas. We grabbed a whole bunch without labeling them so I really don't know which one I liked the most. 

We luckily found a table. Our food came out fast. I liked the burrito a lot. It was a little messy, but I probably ate it in less than five minutes. There was a nice kick and the brown rice mix was a nice substitute for white rice. 

Staff was super friendly. Like a lot of places in NoDa parking can be tricky. 

We managed to find a table."}
{"text":"Really good priced food that also actually tasted really good. The NODA neighborhood is nice and this place fits in just right. The salsa bar is awesome and the service was quick and friendly. It almost reminds me of a slightly better version of Chipotle...and I love Chipotle!!!!"}
{"text":"This is not the place to go when it's very busy. Had to return the first to go order because my protein bowl was pretty much just black beans. Returning this to the location in Noda is not an easy trip. Had to pay $5 to park and when I got home with the second to go order, had to throw it down the drain. The steak was scraps with fat and gristle. Couldn't even chew it! Then there was the very salty taste of the so called steak. My boyfriend didn't return his although he said he should have after trying to get through it. Don't think I will be trying this anytime soon again. And this was a place that I highly liked when it first opened,  but now it seems like they are cutting corners and it's just another bad fast food joint."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Gosh. Talk about authentic flavors. Can you say \"Carne Asada Fries\"? They were SO good! We also got the nachos and some tacos and the elote loca! Super small seating area so if it's crowded you might not find a seat. I think the pictures of the food here are all you need to be drawn in. Authentic taste, good size portions. OH, and tacos are cheaper weekdays in the afternoon! I can't remeber exactly what time, but it's all worth it. 
Let me also say that this food was so good that I didn't even cry when I saw my car had been scratched when I went back to it after eating. That's how happy this place made me. 

Eat on!"}
{"text":"Awesomely delicious street food. I ate corn on a stick in Mexico City, and it was not as delicious as it looked, and since then, I haven't been able to find that perfect corn, until now, at Sabor - tangy, sweet and not too hot. Just right. The empanada was the best I have ever tasted. The Vege Empanada had a perfect amount of cheese and veges, then fried to perfection. The healthy quinoa and avocado bowl was delicious, too. Very reasonably priced, set in a dive-type atmosphere, Sabor was so good, we lingered on for round 2."}
{"text":"5 starts every damn time. We used to live in the studios right across the street and literally ate at sabor 4-5 times a week. My go to is always the epic protein bowl, and my wife the nachos. We deviate sometimes and get the elote, or some tacos and never have regretted it. One time the cashier literally ran out the door after me because they forgot one taco! Not surprised sabor is blowing up and expanding all over Charlotte, it's well deserved."}
{"text":"Very trendy spot in NoDa that has become really popular. This place has great daily specials on food and beer ( bottles & draft). My favorite dishes here are the arepa and the empanadas. The arepa is definitely a meal within itself: fried corn-cake like sandwich with ample shredded chicken , cheese, and sauce inside. The empanadas are smaller, thinner pastry crust that's fried, but still delicious. I've also had the yuca fries which are awesome. Another neat thing about this place is the sauce station to the side. There are at least 7 varying degrees of intensity of sauces you can help yourself too. Very busy on Tuesdays ( $1 tacos)."}
{"text":"This is one of my regular favorites! I am here every Tuesday for their $1 tacos and sometimes I make happy hour from 3 to 5 on any day. My bro enjoys the deals they have on craft beer. The customer service is supreme. this is one of the few places I can go and still get treated like a human being, connect with real people and get my difficult order the way I dream it in my head. Lol. The food was wonderful everytime and fills me up when it's so difficult to find good healthy food late at night. The atmosphere is clean and friendly for couples, families and people who love community. I suggest them as the best place to eat in Noda.!"}
{"text":"Went for $1 tacos one night. I love the atmosphere of the place which is no surprise with it being in NODA. I had a margarita which was just decent not good but not bad also. The tacos are made with a corn tortilla which I'm not crazy about but besides that they were really good. The chips and queso were great as well! You get more then enough chips to share with another person or two."}
{"text":"The fish tacos are my go-to! I would also recommend the guacamole with their homemade chips. Great quality food for an affordable price and excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Please get a/c in your restaurant. We talked it, felt sweat smell inside. It surely didn't feel like a/c was working. It was hot, everyone looked uncomfortable. We left!  How can you please crept anyone to enjoy their dinner in the heat like that?  If it was a temporary issue, they should have closed the restaurant for the night instead of making their guests uncomfortable. If the restaurant is always this hot, I have no further comments. I guess I'll never find out, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Really good Spanish food! Their arepa is amazing and Soooo filling! I wish chips were free, but we don't live in a perfect world. But I've tried multiple things on their menu and the food is amazing! They have $1 tacos on Tuesdays and $5 margaritas on Friday!"}
{"text":"Very upset I just learned about this place.  The food is absolutely delicious.  100000x better than chipotle.  Chipotle pretty good dog food compared to this place.  

Only thing they could do a little better is the bar it's a little disorganized."}
{"text":"Everyone likes to go to Cabo next door... but the real value is Sabor. Since it's more casual, the service is quick and on a busy day there is less of a wait, if any. The tacos here are really good and the flavors are more traditional. 

The specials are great as well! Thursday's is arepa and empanada day for $6, you can't beat that deal. They also have great drink specials and have a great selection of local beer. The hot sauces are awesome, they are not for everybody, but if you like spicy there is something definitely for you. 

For a quick, good, casual food in Noda, this is a great place to try out."}
{"text":"Don't know what happened here but .... this place isn't good. Tables not cleaned, salsa not refilled and slow service. Like super slow. Staff seems more interested in chatting with friends. Poor service. I live nearby and this place has gone downhill.  So I will add service is super super slow - over 30 minutes so far for a few tacos and an empanada."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Sabor and their food.  Been to the Elizabeth location, then was near Noda and headed over.  My parents were in town and we wanted to introduce them to goodness.  

Ordering was quick and easy.  3 Al Pastor burritos and 3 shrimp tacos with chips.  Food was ready in a good amount of time but the burritos were COLD!!!!!  How does this happen???  The meat and burrito shell were cold.  They fixed it right away (not really sure what they did but I just don't get it.  

I love Sabor and thankfully one just opened near my house but probably won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"Nachos the size of your 16 month old child? CHECK!
Decently priced premium margaritas? CHECK!
Everything else that's right with the world? CHECK!

I've heard of this Sabor establishment from friends but never tried it until one arrived in NoDa and I'm so glad it did. I love the fast paced atmosphere, the drink selection, the food, and most importantly the salsa bar. 

The staff is great, the spot is baby friendly, and I always leave with a full belly and a little buzz."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my Loco tacos! I also had an arepa that was SO fresh. Chips were seasoned to perfection, really. And can we talk about the Amigos Margarita?! Seriously one of the best margaritas I've had in a while. The woman who took my order was super friendly and had GREAT recommendations. I will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"All I can say is Taco Tuesdaysssss... Sabor never disappoints.. I love there freshly made veggie tacos that have zucchini in them which is very much delicious, there fresh shrimp tacos that are made with very fresh grilled shrimp and there empanadas are great...it's safe to say that I would go on a night even when there tacos aren't a dollar lol...a must go authentic taco spot."}
{"text":"What??!  You opened up a Sabor next to Cabo Taco! Genius! Lucy, you got some 'splainin' to do!!!

Tacos can be tricky - the proteins are everything! They nail them here.

My first visit I had the Tacos Locos (double chorizo please!), Authenticos with Steak and hands down my fave,  the Curtido Fish tacos. Throw in a Yelp Chips and Queso offer and a Salsa bar. Then top it off with half price craft beer on Saturdays. Dude, I'm in heaven!

I stared at the beer case for at least five minutes, then realized they have them printed on a list. A few local ones on tap (that you can sample)and a full page of bottled and canned. Once again. Sweet! Dude!! Sweet!

Fun, friendly employees who just add to the good vibe!

Saving my fifth star for the Gorditas and Empanadas before I let it run wild through the streets of NODA. If NODA gets any cooler, it's going to be frozen...."}
{"text":"It's not just because it's my neighborhood or because I am Latina or because they provide water bowls for dogs on the side walk or because I can grab a Colombiana soda or a XX beer while my food is prepared or because they have amazing sauces you have choose from....wait no wait, it's definitely the sauces, I like sauce! Oh and I definitely like Sabor"}
{"text":"My Bride and I hit Sabor on a Saturday night after a day a Heroes Con at The Convention Center. And they were on fire. In the best possible way."}
{"text":"Extremely inconsistent food. You can barely hear you name called when your food is ready and then it creates some awkwardness at the food window when you inquire.

The one on Hawthorne is way better."}
{"text":"Loved this place!  I went on a Thursday and got the special for that day (Arepa and Empanada) for $6! Woah what a deal! Everything was made to order and it was delicious!  My friend got the shrimp nachos which were pretty!  She said they were tasty too.  I got a mojito too and it could have been better but other than that it was great.  I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim but oh was I impressed not only with the food, the freshness, the service, just and overall great experience. The only negative was it was more people than seats. A great problem to have. The Dominican burrito was hot and fresh from beginning to end. And the empanadas was good too! Come check it out!"}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch. Hubby and I ordered burritos. Well when you walk in it was VERY hot like they did not have the AC on. Then you order and pay at the register. The lady who took my order looked like she was going to yoga or Zumba class. No one was dress like they were running a professional business. The cooks and staff was not friendly. I was better off eating drive thru food. I did not like the atmosphere at all. On to the food. The burritos were basic basic basic nothing about them wowed me. They are a good size and one will definitely fill you up but the food lacked flavor. I hear the taco were good but I didn't get them and I won't be back a 2nd time to try the tacos either. I ordered a margarita and it tasted like lemonade didn't taste any alcohol so the drinks are a thumbs down. Overall I should have just gone to Cabo next door and I would NOT have been disappointed. I have eaten at Cabo 3 times this week already and needed a break but now I know when something is great just stick with it!!!' So just to recap: staff needs to be more friendly, the woman at the register needs to learn how to dress and the food needs some flavor and love in it. Peace!"}
{"text":"The nachos here are really good and the portion is really good I love the el lote here as well"}
{"text":"Great friendly staff. Great food!! I would recommend. Good place to hang out. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Idk. It was ok - bordering on good. However, it just wasn't anything spectacular. The tacos Americanos and the autenticos were good, a little bland, and nothing to write home about. 

Would I be back? If in the neighborhood and nothing else was open."}
{"text":"This is the place for both authentic and fusion Latin street food! It's so good you'll be back again and again and again!"}
{"text":"Chicken arepa was good in flavor and size. Nice crunch on the outside and soft inside. 
Guacamole good, comes with chips.
Shredded beef authentic taco is very flavorful. 
Elite loco: grilled corn sweet and juicy 

Salsa bar with good variety of red and green salsa along with two with habanero.  
Over all not bad if you want to try street food from various Latin country. On Saturday their beers are half off."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place!  Their tacos are out of this world.  Try the Al Pastor authenticos & make sure to get guacamole"}
{"text":"I like this location best BUT THERE'S NO REAL PARKING. 
Solely street parking and a pay meter lot on the next side street but that's about all. 
Management here is astute and offers the little things to make your journey easier. 

The staff is nice at both places but I feel everyone here is trying harder to show their sincere and eager to help....which I appreciate being new to the restaurant and all. 

The specials board is immediately to the right of the register. 
FREEBIE with Yelp check in remains. 
I didn't notice plugs at the tables because I grabbed it to go. 
The place is going through some construction work - either a build out or additions. IDK

Ummm, all in all - I am a fan and would eagerly give it 5 stars as I think of this location often and want to return but that parking makes it an easy 4 plus I have only had 1 visit. 

Writing a review for this place breaks my own rule but it's soooo worth it as they provide a great service. Oh! and got the Thursday special here on 11/3/16 and they drained the grease and all. Hawthorne did not replicate this the following Thursday on 11/10/2016.

4 stars for the salsa bar. They have pineapple, 2 greens, 3 reds and the mayo based Rosado
I like heat and flavor - some of the darker salsas have the heat but not the best flavor. 
I'm sticking to the first two red salsas for that reason. 

The chicken arepa comes with tomatoes, shredded cheese and that rosado sauce (which I don't care for) BUT the empanada is my fan favorite. IT's worthwhile and filled well. Ground beef and cheese for the Thursday special. I've had the arepa now and know I don't care for the shredded chicken but will try the pork one before making the final cut. 

The chips are equivalent to the Hawthorne location. And that's all I have had to date from this location."}
{"text":"Everything is always fresh & filing portion sizes. My go-to is the nachos they are layered with cheese, beans, choice of protein, lettuce and topped with guacamole/salsa & sour cream. I'm sure I'm forgetting something but you get the picture on how awesome they are! 


On this visit I changed it up and got a Chicken Stuffed to the brim quesadilla! I added black beans and green peppers. 

Each day they have specials whether it be drinks or tacos!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  I got the Sabor Especial burrito in a bowl and made it a combo with chips and a drink.  So much food and its all really good.  We also got a large queso and chips.  The queso could use a bit more flavor, but all in all everything is good."}
{"text":"My entire experience with this restaurant was phenomenal!! Everything was amazing. The food was very vibrant and tasty. The atmosphere was laid back and chill. From the cashier to the cooks to the bartender nothing but smiles and great quality of everything! I will continue to come here and recommend to everyone!!"}
{"text":"Went to this location on Friday and liked it so much we came back on Saturday. But I just didn't really like it as much the second time. 

Maybe it was the fact that they didn't actually credit me my loyalty point, or maybe it was the cashier basically telling me I was an idiot. Maybe it was the complete and utter lack of seating which left us and several other parties standing around uncomfortably with food and drinks in hand but no where to go. Or maybe it was the CHICKEN BONE I found in my taco salad. Still, maybe it was the fact that two people in our party were ID'd twice for drinks even though we were recognized from being previously ID'd yesterday and ID'd from our first round of drinks and--let's be honest here--we don't look even close to our twenties and may actually have been the oldest party in the joint. I can't really seem to put my finger on it. Maybe it was the fact that I had to pay $.10 extra for beans on Friday but $.25 extra for beans on Saturday even though I got fewer beans on Saturday. 

The margaritas were good. The mojitos were too. The plantains were fabulous both nights. If I lived close enough to stop in for take out, or if I was insecure about aging and wanted someone to be ridiculous about carding me, or if I liked eating standing up, maybe I'd have been happier here. Instead, I think I'll try the fish taco place next door next time I'm around. They have the courtesy of telling you how long until a table is ready rather than letting you order and stand around waiting like a tired, hungry, dip and yelling at you if you don't have enough hands to hold all of the items you ordered and your drink while waiting for a table and then not letting you order another drink if you finished your first one before you even were able to find a seat... Too bad, though, cause I love plantains and Latin drinks at reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"The original location in Elizabeth will always have my heart but their NoDa spot is slowly growing on me as they hit their stride. We've stopped in a couple times now after patronizing Salud or Dog Bar or Jack Beagles... You get the point. Nothing caps off a night of drinking quite like and arepa and nachos! 

Arepas are the star at Sabor, hands down. But, their tacos, nachos (both the supreme with chips or Dominican with yucca), empanadas, elote, and carne asada fries are not to be overlooked, either. 

And, in case you needed another reason to visit, they offer half priced craft beer on Saturdays. I repeat. HALF PRICED CRAFT BEER ON SATURDAYS. You can't find a drink special in Charlotte on the weekends, much less half priced beer on a Saturday. Thanks, Sabor!!"}
{"text":"Cool little spot in NODA that is open to the street. Bad news is when it's hot outside, it's also pretty warm inside but they have fans so it's not too bad. You order your food up at the counter and wait until your name is called to pick it up. Everyday from 3-5 and all day Thursday they have $1 taco (specific ones). I heard the tacos were okay so I ordered the chicken arepa which I heard were good. The arepa was definitely very hot to hold for awhile. My only complaint is that the fillings weren't really spread out. So my first few bites were all cheese. I ended up mixing it all up with my fork and scooping it out instead of eating it like an uncrustable pb&j. Overall, pretty good. They have a variety of sauces which were also good. I tried two of the spicier ones, one of which was a pineapple salsa. Not too spicy. Also tried the yuca fries which were okay."}
{"text":"Still scratching my head as to why/how two taco places end up next to each other, but never-the-less I'm glad there is another Sabor location option in Charlotte.  Their food is super good and I've never been disappointed in my visits to either location.

The best part about the NODA location is the space.  Compared to Elizabeth location, the NODA location has more tables.  The lines still manage to go, literally, out the door for taco Tuesdays, but it is definitely worth the wait.

Staff and are friendly and here to serve you (even though there's a slight feeling of chaos).  There are very nice staffers waiting for people to get up from the table and wipe it down for the next party and it feels like there's a flow and organization to it all.

Cannot beat $1 tacos on Tuesdays, but I always end up getting elote which is super delicious.  The salsa bar allows you to try varying degrees of heat and deliciousness.

Guess the only drawback is parking situation.  Fighting the street parking in the NODA area, but I'm glad the houses don't mind people parking in front of their homes to enjoy the great restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Pretty decent food. Except they ALWAYS try to give me a hard time about asking for the corn cut off the cob (because I have braces) the service is always terrible but the food is good so I come back. I'm just writing this review to let management know how terrible their staff is. I also was here once when some former employee came in and raised hell while we were eating. Needs much improvement. Food is honestly on the decline as well"}
{"text":"Came here with our young child. It was definitely hit. The food is delicious and the service is wonderful, and it is very kid friendly. We had an assortment of tacos and empanadas and guacamole."}
{"text":"Today I had a great experience at this location. While there I was greeted by the owner and had an enjoyable conversation with him about food. Now let me start about the food. I have eaten at the other location and was pleased. This location didn't disappoint as well, as a matter of fact I think the food was a little better. My only criticism would be the salsa is a little watery for my taste. I'm a fan of chunkier salsa. However, the place was very clean and the ambience was  pleasant. The owner is very knowledgeable about Latin cuisine and the differences within the culture which plays a big role in his restaurant brand. The corn can I say it takes me back to LA mexican street food. Very good quality of food freshly made and you can taste it. I will go back and the owner Dave was the icing on the top."}
{"text":"I have only visited Sabor once but I can't wait to come back! A group of friends and I shared the Supreme Nachos, which at $7 is an absolute steal. They really load it up for you. The refried beans and the cotija cheese are the standout ingredients and it is a mountain of food. I'm excited to try the rest of the food and the awesome specials they offer throughout the week!"}
{"text":"Would definitely recommend this place. The street style tacos are very authentic. You should try the chicken empanadas."}
{"text":"Great second impression. We came here right after we moved to NoDa and we were not impressed by the food nor the service. A lot has changed all for the better. We put in an order for take out - 2 quinoa avocado bowls, and paid extra for shrimp and avocado. When we got home, we realized we didn't get the chicken in one of the bowls. A phone call to Steve (assuming the manager?) and he offered to either make us a new bowl or comp the chicken and the kids meal we also bought. Very friendly and professional. Plus the bowls themselves were delicious - especially the grilled shrimp. Glad that Sabor has really turned things around and they're a great asset to the NoDa neighborhood."}
{"text":"Sabor is easily my favorite quick and cheap eat in NoDa. The dining area can be a little crowded at peak times, but it usually clears up quickly. $1 tacos on Tuesday are one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"This Sabor location always pulls through in times of need. I find myself often over at Company Store and aching for a bite somewhere 3-4 beers through a Sunday afternoon. (The CoSto's grill line leads to something good and free but sometimes a guy's just gotta eat.)

The guys running the register have always been equal parts chill and friendly. If you don't already have the Yelp app and an account you seriously need to get it solely for the purpose of free chips with a check in here. And the chips are worth actual money too so free is, well, killin' it!

You can order an assortment of tacos, burritos, bowls, salads and so-on in Tex-Mex fashion. Protein choices include pork, beef, chicken and tofu. Naturally, no meat is always an option and I would strongly recommend this joint to any vegan or vegetarian. The coolers house lots of bottled beer options and they even have a tap in the back. You can use tap to pay (Android, Apple, etc.). A good amount of seating inside. Oh and did I forget the salsas? Quite the selection here - no fewer than four options spanning from mild up to death.

They can certainly be a tad on the pricey side but I always think it's well worth it. Last bit of advice: don't plan on parking nearby. Be ready to walk. You'll be happy you did when you're done gorging yourself."}
{"text":"I have always gone to the Elizabeth location, but I like this one even better. I feel like it is cleaner and more organized, but the same great food! Everything is good, and you get a ton of food for the money. My personal favorite is the taco salad- no shell. That way I can load up on chips and guac too. I love the salsa bar!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of both Three Amigos and the other Sabor locations, so when I was in the area, I decided it was time to try the new Sabor location to see how things are stacking up thus far.

First, the decor: Big thumbs up. While the original (7th/Hawthorne) location is spartan, and that might be a bit generous, and the Indian Trail spot is utilitarian, the NoDa spot is sweet, with something of an urban industrial flair. I like it.

As with the other locations - of both outlets - service is excellent, and the food is served quickly. Like the other Sabor spots, there is also a salsa bar, which is a nice touch.

Which leaves us with the food. The advantage to the original Three Amigos, and also the original Sabor, is that they had a certain grunge to them, and it is this appeal that this is hard to carry over to another location - any time you open a new location, you have to not only duplicate recipes, but the environment and the chef's personality as well.

Three Amigos has done a reasonable job, but the original is still the best. Sabor has done okay thus far, but it is apparent now that the food is leaving the street level and reaching more for main street at this point. This isn't bad if you are an investor - to reach the masses, you need to look at it from this point. But for the diner, it is a different approach. If you compare the earlier Sabor to the newest, something has been sanitized out, and while this newest entrant is still better than many other places (including of course Cabo, just next door), it isn't as good as the original."}
{"text":"Amazing as always. Came here for a late lunch. We ordered and quickly got a table. This location gets way packed. I got the burrito with ground beef. It was my first time getting the beef and it was absolutely delicious. I usually get steak but the beef will definitely be my go to choice. The salsas are good as usual. We got our food quickly and had no issues at all. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Delicious and quick! Surprising to see a taco place next to another taco place. I had a shrimp and an al pastor taco with a small side of guac. Chips were hot and seasoned. It was a great lunch before I headed back out to do more errands. Come check it out instead of waiting and waiting for cabo fish taco!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on a perfect day- Taco Tuesday. The chicken, ground beef, black bean, or veggie tacos are only $1. We each had a chicken and ground beef taco and they were delicious. The salsa bar has some awesome salsas but most are very hot! We will come back to try the Colombian and Argentinian offerings. It's a cute spot in the heart of Noda with fun Spanish music playing."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Being from Las Vegas I never knew of any place with carne Asada fries until I stumbled in this place. They are sooooo good!! Drink specials are amazing as well. I always stop by here when I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Ahhhhhhh I struggle rating this place, I wasn't satisfied with the tacos that I got- fortunately two of them were $1 so wasn't too unhappy. The $1 tacos you can choose from include veggie, black bean, chicken and beef. I ordered shredded chicken which was bland and the ground beef which was better but still missing some spices. Also ordered al pastor from the regular menu- it was okay. It would've tastes better if it was marinated longer. Also the small size of refried beans is ridiculously small so order a size up!
But you can get a huge order of chips for free if you check 

It was easy to get a table, great salsa bar selection, and staff was friendly and kept the place clean. I'm hoping the next time I go that the food will be better! Crossing my fingers!"}
{"text":"Pineapple habanero salsa. The best condiment in Charlotte. 

I've been in a pretty serious relationship with the Sabor in Elizabeth for years. Now I have this mistress in NoDa. 

What's not to love about Sabor? They have a salsa bar. That's right, an entire bar of salsas. Pro tip: Make sure to check in on your Yelp app and score some free chips. I love their queso. If you have a group, get the nachos. They are massive and a steal. Other favs for me: Three Amigos Burrito, corn on the cob, and the empanadas. Thy have different specials throughout the week, including Taco Tuesday. Warning: all their locations get packed for this. 

It's NoDa, so parking sucks. Pack some patience and go drive around the neighborhood looking for a street spot. You'll need the walk back to the car to work off those tacos."}
{"text":"Them Tacos and that salsa bar are off the hook!!  Great late night treat after beers at Salud!!  Prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is quaint.  Can't wait to try the other menu items!!"}
{"text":"Delicious and cheap, can't beat that! The tacos are so good. Chicken with chorizo and they use two warmed corn tortillas to hold all that goodness. The nachos are a meal for two. So big my nephew calls them the volcano. Not much wrong with this joint. Can't forget the fresh salsa bar. Another spot on choice in NoDa."}
{"text":"Amazeballz... great food awesome atmosphere, quick most of the time! Could benefit from bigger or stronger utensils(I feel like the Hulk when I use'em), but for the most part everything is finger foods. So don't mind me. Go and enjoy it!"}
{"text":"OhmyGod, the food here. The salsa bar. Everything. Super vegan-friendly. Super delicious. I'm leaving off a star because this is all I ever want after a drunken NoDa night, but this place closes before the bars (which doesn't make sense)."}
{"text":"Everything is good here. Very busy on Tuesdays for $1 tacos but worth the wait. The service is always friendly and efficient. Best Arepas in town."}
{"text":"Great food, fair prices, large portions. Ordered the build your own rice bowl and for 8 bucks that was a lot of food. The mexican street corn was delicious. These guys also dont skimp when it comes to ice in drinks. Great little spot."}
{"text":"The NODA location is a perfect fit for the neighborhood offering a good option for quick lunch or dinner before bar hopping. It's as if they created Taco Tuesday, that's how crowed they get while serving their $1 Tuesday Taco special, no matter the wait or time of day, it is always worth swinging to Sabor for relatively authentic Latin fare.  Don't fret if you see a crowd out the door because food is always well prepared, served, and eaten at a lightning pace.  I, personally, love the Three Amigos Burrito with Chorizo sausage, and it's important not to miss their Thursday Empanada and Arepa special which is just as good if not better than the Tuesday dollar tacos.  Long story short you must stop by one of their 9 Charlotte area locations.  As for the NODA location, I've never had an issue with the wait staff, they are always extremely accommodating and I love the Latin ambiance of the interior."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely amazing! The elote was very tasty and not over cooked. The beef empanada was very flavorful and the al pastor arepa was good but I wouldn't get al pastor. It lacked flavor. They have $1 tacos on Tuesday. The beef was really good and the chicken as well. Highly recommended restaurant!"}
{"text":"Hello friends, 

I came here on the recommendation of a co-worker. They always order the queso dip and some other item. The menu isn't 6 pages full of everything (I swear I hate reading a menu book). It's pretty short a sweet. Which leads me to believe they don't want to be good at a lot of things but rather be great at a few.

Did somebody say Great?
Great = Carne asada fries.

Go try that. Then get back to me for more slap ya momma (in law) additional item. I had carry out so I can't speak on the service for dine in. I did however notice different beer selection in the bottle. Which is great and should be expected considering the location. 

TTFN"}
{"text":"Decent tacos... good pricing on Tuesday's for taco Tuesday! Very family friendly and always a good time when sitting outside."}
{"text":"The food was actually quite good and that was after it sat while being delivered! I was impressed and cannot wait to try it out at the restaurant! I got the guac, an empanada, an arepa as well as a gordita and everything was delicious."}
{"text":"Food was great! Had the Thursday Special: Arega and Empanada, added a 1L Mexican Coke, delicious! Affordable and tasty. Will be back very soon."}
{"text":"Good food.  Taco Tuesday is the happening night...tacos on this night are cheap and while it is a pretty good deal, I would say to avoid this night.  It gets crazy!!!  And worse than that, the parking literally is nonexistent.  It sucks...would not recommend.

So go on a regular day/night and have the chance to enjoy the good service, food, and not have anxiety about parking. The food always taste fresh and flavor.  It comes out hot along with chips and salsa, perfect combo.  I would recommend any taco lover to try this place."}
{"text":"The street corn was amazing. Definitely my favorite thing here. I'll come back for that for sure. The atmosphere was cool and the service was pretty great. Give them a shot if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Every dish has a distinctive flavor. Arepe is a must try!!!  The locos, yummmmm. Huge burritos of you are starving. Empanadas are delish!!"}
{"text":"Consistently one of the best restaurant in Charlotte. I am addicted!!!! I come almost weekly for the $1 Taco Tuesdays but the burritos are my true favorite!  The tacos for $1 you can't beat. They have so many options between chicken, beef, veggie, and black bean. The salsa bar is one of my favorite things about this hidden gem in NODA! The pineapple salsa is my favorite salsa out of store bought or anything else. It is sweet and then kicks in! Can't get enough of this place! The ingredients are always so fresh and the prices are reasonable. If you're reading this trying to decide if you should go here, YES YES YES!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered food from here a couple of weeks ago on a monday night online and once I got there no one was there. I kept calling and no answer either. On the door it stated that they were having a Christmas party that night and would be closed. Yet had the online ordering still available. Here I am without $30 and no food and I drove 25 minutes to get there. Plus no voicemail on their phone to let people know they would be closing early. Highly upset. So the next day I spoke with the manager Steve and he informed me he would give me a refund and he is sorry and the online ordering should of been turned off but the next time I come I can get free chips and dip. Not really showing concern or empathy (like I can get free chips and dip just be signing/checking in to yelp) plus no type of incentive for me driving that far plus having to buy more food that night. Smh. I just know I won't be going or telling anyone about Sabor in Noda anymore. Management there HAS to do better!"}
{"text":"Possibly best queso ever. Bout to do a blind taste test this weekend. The opponent: Porch (Winston-Salem) Queso."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed myself here. It's not an upscale place. You basically order your food and look for an open seat. They call your name when it's ready. My husband enjoyed the open salsa bar. The empanadas are to die for. They are big and full of meat and cheese. I ordered the quesadilla and he got the Dominican (i think that's the name). We came hungry but left full. He went back the next day and got more empanadas for us both."}
{"text":"New to NoDa so trying all of the local spots and so far loving them all. Tonight is Sabor.

I enjoyed my meal but felt like it was something missing flavor wise in my quesadilla. I ordered a chicken with black beans and a steak with just cheese and both were well prepared and good but again missing something in the flavor. I will definitely be back to try other things on their menu.

Customer service at Sabor and surrounding bars/restaurants have been top notch. The staff is very friendly, considerate and funny. My cashier was very nice in recommending a few options which I ultimately settled on the quesadillas.

I would definitely recommend Sabor to friends & fellow Yelpers. They also have an cool outside spot and completely doggy friendly (woof  woof )."}
{"text":"A wonderful addition to the NoDa neighborhood! This restaurant replaced the wine bar that wasn't as frequented as the other bars in the area. So far Sabor seems to be reeling customers and staying consistently busy!

Their menu has your typical arrangement of Latin foods but also has some not so typical surprises! They have options for vegetarians as well as many gluten free options. Each day there are different specials so make sure to check on those before ordering. I've been on a Tuesday (Taco Tuesday, $1 tacos) and on Friday when they do half off craft beer! 

The food is prepared right there before you and after you order you can take a trip over to the salsa bar and choose one to your likings. I believe there are about 5 or 6 different salsas. They will call your name and you can choose to sit inside or outside at one of their neat bar seats. 

Overall a great addition to an already wonderful neighborhood. This is not the only one in Charlotte so be sure to check out the other location(s) too!"}
{"text":"This place was so delicious!! I had tofu tacos and they were absolutely delicious. We were in Noda for a concert across the street, and we were so happy to find this restaurant for dinner before the show. Highly recommend for authentic latino food!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite go-to spot. There are locations all over Charlotte so you can get this amazing food in most neighborhoods. I always get the tofu ranchero on top of the avocado quinoa bowl. Today I splurged. The tofu ranchero burrito is amazing. New favorite! 

Always add in some yuca fries when you have the craving. You can't go wrong with these crispy on the outside, smooth on the inside potato sticks!

The food is prepared quickly and the service is friendly! Have a beer and enjoy the easy vibes with your people!"}
{"text":"The tacos are okay. The ground beef is so bland, the chicken is okay. It is only worth it when you go for the $1 taco.
The chips and salsa are good tho, overall it you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"My fiancé loves this place. All she ever gets is that stupid nachos plate. I guess it makes her happy so I should be happy. Oh well try it out people it's awesome"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!! My first time trying, saw a few bad reviews but decided to ignore and drive 30 mins to this spot. Placed my order online so everything was perfectly clear - upon arrival my food was late, and still somehow cold. Walked back to the car and realized one of my BYOB was only the inside filling placed in a take out box. Walked back in, they apologized and wrapped what was in the box, in a flour tortilla. After going back to my car - pulling it out to eat it completely falls apart not even wrapped what so ever. I spent close to $10 for a burrito for them to screw up 3 times. Completely fed up."}
{"text":"I loved this place. I love the employees who are very friendly

I had the nachos....I LOVE NACHOS!!!!

I think it was the nachos supreme (not the Dominican nachos). OMG!!! They were EVERYTHING!!!!   I got the tilapia as my protein topping. 

The nachos are enough for two. I also got some Mexican street cord (elote).  Let's just say there was a party in my mouth. YUMMY!!!

I love that there is a sauce bar. My favorite was the pineapple habanero. It's not for the weak but the kick of habanero intertwined with the sweetness of pineapple.... a sure WINNER!!!!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a flavor- eat here.
Super friendly! Great food. 5 seats outside- grab one if you can and watch NoDa go by. I loved the build your own bowl. Chips are fresh and house made, tacos fresh, empanada just right.
A couple of minor mixups - 4stars, that they corrected with grace and ease."}
{"text":"I have been a regular at Sabor on Elizabeth and have always had a great experience. Last night at the NoDa location was slightly different, but still delicious. I went with a group of friend after grabbing some beer at Salud (BTW - Sabor offers free delivery to Salud when you order online, which is super cool!). Of our group of six, my boodle and I were the last to order, and we ordered taco salads. 

It was crowded in Sabor, but we were able to find a table. Our drinks came out quickly, and they were great to have while we were waiting on our food. Speaking of waiting on our food, we waited... and waited... and waited. Everyone else in our group had long gotten their order and almost finished, and several other patrons after us had received their food. When the hubs went to inquire, he was told that it was a weekend and we should expect to wait. I do agree with this, but it's probably not the best message to send when there's clearly a delay/issue. 

Anyway, when my taco salad came out, it was awesome. The barbacoa beef has a nice kick to it, and the tortilla bowls was fresh, crispy, and delicious. I highly recommend Sabor!"}
{"text":"Love their empanadas, guacamole, and street corn. I should probably explore more of the menu but those three are my go-to's"}
{"text":"Me and my girl just tried this new spot in Noda . Place is awesome . It has a So Cal feel yet very Noda . Hip and Authentic at the same time ."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere at this Sabor. Its located in the heart of NoDa, and is a great alternative to Cabo Fish Taco, plus it offers a more authentic Mexican street food menu. Large plate glass windows in the front are great for people watching, and in this part of town, purple watching is king. 

The staff is always friendly, the food is consistently solid, and even when crowded, things unusually move at a good clip. You'll never wait more than about 10ish minutes you place an order.

Also, Jarritos. You can buy Jarritos there. The whole rainbow of 'em.

I always appreciate a restaurant threat had artwork honoring the culture from which their food comes, and this location has a full length wall mural of Mexican street vendors and kitchen workers. 

Definitely check out out the next time you venture to the cool part of town."}
{"text":"I love this place. The tacos are great (and are $1 on Taco Tuesdays). The corn is great. Everything is great and not expensive at all. Tip: don't get the nachos if you're eating alone, they are huge!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and the food was okay. The location is great but the dining area needs a facelift. They ask you if you want to provide a tip when you finish ordering your food. I declined and stated I would leave a cash tip. Well there is no additional service other than the cook making your food that you have already paid for. I guess they call you but I heard nothing and my food was just sitting in the counter I figured it was mines because there were not many ppl here. Then my second plate was just placed on the counter and I knew then no number or name was called. You make your own drinks and no one came by to see if everything was okay. So what's the point in leaving a tip? There were four to five employees working this day. I might visit another location if I decide to explore this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Loud, crowded, busy. However, the layout was very clear what you needed to do to order your food. Sometimes in Latin Street food places, I find it's a bit confusing with all of the options they offer.

Our party of 5 ordered our food to-go, and they had it ready and packaged very well.

The food was flavorful, and they gave plenty of it! Love their salsa sections too. I ordered the carne asada fries and they were fab!

I totally love this place! It's a bit on the pricey side for \"street food\", but I think you're getting a good value for money!"}
{"text":"Love to spilt the steak Nachos with my boyfriend !! And the tacos are great as well! Taco Tuesday is every Tuesday and tacos are 1 buck!! Why not??"}
{"text":"I had a chicken taco and a steak loco taco! They were both excellent. The pineapple salsa was amazing. Guacamole was very flavorful and beer selection was great."}
{"text":"We normally go to Cabo when we are in this area, but last time we were here the line was too long. We were down for a show at the Evening Muse, and we only had about 45 minutes until show starts. With a 45 min wait at Cabo, we had to do something faster. We stopped in at Sabor, immediately ordered and then luckily found a table. They were pretty busy, but the crowd was moving through reasonably fast. I thought the food was pretty good. Cheese dip and Fish Taco's were the order of the day. Overall, this is an ok place. The atmosphere is fine and the staff reasonably friendly. Its not Cabo, but a decent alternative when you either have less time, or want to spend less money. I wish they had more seating because that was a slightly stressful not being sure we could get a table, but in retrospect almost everyone was finding one."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Sabor! It's always our go-to spot when we want to grab something easy in Charlotte. They have five locations and this is the second we've been to. We had fast service and our food came out quickly. Everything was delicious and we left happy. Make sure to check in on Yelp so you can use the free chips offer."}
{"text":"One of my favorite (if not my absolute favorite!) places to eat in Noda. Food is consistently delicious, staff is always friendly and welcoming, and the food is fairly priced! Although it's always busy, I've hardly had to wait in line or for a table. I guess I just come at the right times! The bathrooms are well kept and clean. I also love when it's warmer weather and they open up the garage door thing. I recommend the chicken empanadas and to compliment it, a Mexican coke! ;)"}
{"text":"My second time here had to eat in great food, good service. The mojtios are GREAT! $5 ON THURSDAY can't beat it. I will be back for $1 Tuesday tacos!"}
{"text":"Normally I would have awesome things to say about this location but unfortunately my latest visit wasn't the best. It was a Saturday evening, busy and they seemed to be understaffed. I brought my friends from out of town as I typically do because it's a great place and I love NoDa. I ordered a Vegetarian Quesadilla (Cheese, Cilantro, Bell Pepper, Onion) and the cashier asked me specifically did I want meat and I said \"NO PROTEIN\", at least  twice in the conversation.  My order normally comes out pretty fast and my friends who ordered almost the whole menu got their stuff and had started to eat. I'm wondering where mine is at? I go up to counter and the cook is like yes I have yours coming out. Finally comes out and it looks very thick for it to only be veggies but I ended up taking a bite anyway, it tasted funny. I open it up and it's shredded chicken inside. I've been a vegetarian for awhile now and this was very very very disappointing, especially when I made the point to the cashier.  I ended up speaking to the manger who was very apologetic, which I appreciate however the excuse of \"It's really busy in here and she was flustered\", is unacceptable. Thank God I didn't have a food allergy. He refunded me for the quesadilla, which Yes was nice however in my opinion my whole order should have been returned as I had already left a tip since you have to pay prior to service. He remade my quesadilla which was also nice and I appreciate. My advice would be to have two cashiers on your busy days because the entire time I was there, the line to order was to the door as well as limited seating. If she is flustered due to the crowd then she doesn't need to be taking orders. Other than that, this place has good vibes and good food."}
{"text":"Just not for me. This is college budget Mexican and I really just can't say I enjoyed either my (fishy) fish taco or veggie taco. The salsas were good and tasted fresh though and the prices were fair. To each their own, not tacos I'd ever come back for."}
