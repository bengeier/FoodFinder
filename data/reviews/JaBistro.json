{"text":"My boyfriend took me for dinner at JaBistro for our anniversary and it was a fantastic experience.  The staff are very friendly and attentive.  In fact, it was the best service I've received in ages. The blowtorch sushi was delicious and really different.  We tried quite a few things from the menu and loved everything.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Best Japanese food in Toronto. Fresh, delicious and fair price. Definitely will visit again!"}
{"text":"Everything surprises me! I have been here several times a month! JaBistro is the best Japanese food restaurant!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in town! We visited Jabistro for my hubby's birthday and I have to say it's the smartest choice I've ever made! We ordered:  50 pcs sashimi platter-very fresh, jabistroll-tasty, Nama-my fav and ended up ordering twice:), aburi and Gyu.  We sit around the corner of the sushi bar. I believe the spot is better than regular table as you can see how masters make sushi and communicate with the Chef. The executive chef Koji is really considerate. I asked the waitress if they have uni sashimi but she said it's not available that night as sashimi. I cannot believe that Koji paid attention to our conversation as when I order my second Nama he put an extra uni on one of the sushi! He even did some change in the second Nama for us and we had a great time trying more kinds of fresh fish! Overall a bit pricy but definitely will go back!"}
{"text":"Being ex-Vancouverites, we were pretty disappointed with the size (and thickness) of the sashimi. However, considering this is Toronto, we understand that good sashimi is rare in the city. Torontonians do not live by the sea.  Sashimi platter: Given the price of the platter (~$50?), it was still worth it, since you got an amazing variety of sashimi to taste. There was, I believe, 2-4 pieces of each sashimi (mostly 2). It was great to have with some of their house cocktails.   Jabistro roll: The price on their sushi may be a bit steeper than your ordinary sushi joints. BUT, trust me, when you put that first piece of nigiri in your mouth, you will be begging for more, and wish you ordered another, unless you've flagged down your waitress already. You could really feel and taste each and every roe that was surrounding the sushi maki, so the flavours and textures of the sushi were out of this world. I truly believe it is one of the best places to enjoy a good maki.   The restaurant also has a great rooftop terrace to enjoy your food on good weather days, probably more when the sun is hotter!  Food: 4/5 Service: 3.5/5 Cleanliness: 4/5 Price: $$$"}
{"text":"Love the salmon sushi with blow torched mayo on top!! Lobster sashimi is good too!! The price is a bit steep but worth it."}
{"text":"This restaurant was absolute perfection. Went here with my boyfriend on a Thursday night for dinner. We had no reservations and we sat at the bar. It wasn't overly busy but each table was full.  Food: 5/5 - we had kamo (duck  breast), beef tartare, sashimi sampler, and amburicious (blow torched sushi sampler) -PERFECTION -they even timed our dishes and served them in a planned and perfect order  Drinks: 5/5 - we had the railroad man and shiso smash which were delicious  The plates are meant for sharing. I highly recommend this place for 2 to 4 people."}
{"text":"Aburicious blowtorched sushi was amazing, the salmon and jalapeno combination was my favorite, but the smoky tiger shrimp was close behind, along with the meaty mackerel. The sashimi sampler was also very fresh and flavorful. Staff is very enthusiastic. Decor is great."}
{"text":"My husband and I were so excited to try Jabistro because of all the good reviews. However, this place is overhyped and overpriced! Sushis were not particularly fresh and service was not attentive. The restaurant was not full and we waited 10-15 mins before we can order, same thing when we want to have the bill. For 2 people, we've paid 200$+ but we didn't eat much. The gindara was 28$ which is almost double the price from what usual restaurants charge. My only hope was the Jabistroll, but it's nothing compared to the delicious Miku roll. Pressed sushis were also much better at Miku. Unfortunately, I won't come back to Jabistro."}
{"text":"From the owners of Guu and Kinton Ramen, JaBistro is another ambitious breed of their mid-range Japanese restaurants. Unlike Guu that exhibits a cultivated rowdiness environment, JaBistro showcases a sleek, modern and sophisticated atmosphere catered to customers with higher food budgets. The interior is long and narrow with an open-counter sushi bar where customers can see the sushi chefs working their magic. I was seated on the second floor on their rooftop patio, decked out in light wood opening to the blue sky. Its minimalist design offers a space of quiet that makes you forget about the hustle and bustle of downtown Toronto.  I was first introduced to this restaurant through a series of extremely photogenic pictures of fish on my Instagram's newsfeed. When ordering, I knew I had to order their speciality, aburi (blow-torched sushi) and their wide selection of high grade sashimi. We ended up ordering the sashimi platter, gyu oshizushi and aburicious. We ordered the $50 sashimi platter instead of the $100 because we wanted to try out the other offerings on the menu.  The sashimi platter came with a good selection of fish including medium fatty tuna (chu-toro), squid (ika), salmon, amberjack (hamachi), sweet shrimp and fried shrimp tails. I have to say the quality and freshness of their fish is one that is difficult to find in Toronto's sushi scene. Every piece of fish was just the right amount of fattiness and the perfect bite size. The presentation was truly an art in itself. Instead of neatly placing it on a plain white plate, the sashimi was served on a black slate slab placed between enchanting cucumber curls and bamboo leafs. One part of the platter I did not understand was the deep fried fish hidden under the sashimi. Was it there for design or eating purposes? I took a bite into it, and turns out it was rock hard tasting stale, not crunchy like I expected.  The aburicious came with 2 ebi (shrimp), 2 saba (mackerel), 2 salmon, and 2 JaBistroll. All 8 nigiri sushi were pressed into a rectangular shape, glazed and blow-torched. The JaBistroll is the house special with real crab, sea urchin, cucumber and salmon rolled in fish roe. The aburicious was both smokey and buttery soft. The rice was also perfectly seasoned with salt and vinegar and didn't require any dips of soy sauce to bring out the flavours.  My favourite was the gyu oshizushi, pressed angus beef sushi. Since it was also blow torched, the top of the beef was lightly seared with the inside being slightly raw. This gave the beef the perfect tender texture that was balanced in flavours, and slowly melts in your mouth. The slice of jalape√±o on the sushi nicely added a hint of heat.  The final bill came to be around $114.36 for two. It is pricer than most Japanese restaurants but the quality of the food is incomparable. JaBistro is unlike any Japanese restaurants I've been to even the ones in Tokyo as it hits the sweet spot between tradition and innovation with its blow-torched sushi."}
{"text":"Summary = Extremely impressed with the service and sashimi, decor is trendy style. seating area small, make reservations or come early!  ----  We came here on a Sunday a few weeks ago without reservations as a last minute restaurant choice and sat by the bar.  As someone else mentioned, the ball wall is too high and had to 'peep' over to see what was happening.  Watching the blowtorch at work was fun although you wonder if they ever have 'accidental fires'?!  We went straight for the $50 sashimi and added on a lobster sashimi and some cooked cod and dessert.  The sashimi on this day had some tuna belly on it, which if you know anything about sushi, is not available at your average AYCE or joe schmo sushi places.  I went to Vancouver awhile back and had the best sashimi outside of Japan, and if you didn't tell me, I would not have known I was in Toronto.  That's how good it was.  In the end, it was worth every penny, however like all places be selective in what you order and stuck to sashimi and none of the fancier fried items, etc.  If you visit here, you go in knowing your bill will be high, do not expect cheap prices, just very, very fresh fish... and that is worth the price."}
{"text":"Yes, JaBistro is GOOOD! Thanks to Ja-Bistro I have become a sushi snob.   It`s again, one of those restaurants where you put food in your mouth, close your eyes, and are taken to another place.   The sushi and sashimi platters are fantastically prepared, full of flavour! I looove the torched sushi and lobster miso that comes with some of the platters. Just magnificent.  Pricey, but please do yourself a flavour and go there to experience the exquisite sushi and sashimi platter. You won`t want to go to another sushi place again.  As for the service, it is friendly and nice!"}
{"text":"For the longest time, I have heard and read great reviews about JaBistro, and I knew I had to give it a try sometime. My boyfriend and I decided to dine at JaBistro last night seeing as a 5:30 reservation was still available. (You can make same-day reservations before 3:30 PM.)  The restaurant is easy to find as it is located right next to Yuk Yuk's. Street parking is available, and there are also a few parking lots in the area. The further west you go, the cheaper it is.   We were welcomed by many friendly faces, and were kindly given the choice to sit by the sushi bar or at a table. Like the restaurant itself, the menu is simple. They also have specials of the day. My boyfriend and I already knew we were interested in ordering the $100 sashimi platter, JaBistroll, and dessert(s). We asked our server what her suggestions were, and it was quite nice of her to mention that the sashimi platter plus the JaBistroll might be a little too much for the two of us. I really wanted to try the JaBistroll, but knowing that the $50 platter is different from the $100 sashimi platter in the quantity AND quality of the fish, we opted for the $100 platter and decided to save the JaBistroll for another day.  We started off with the featured sake, Izumi Shiboritate. Little did we know, Izumi is actually located in the Distillery District...so we gave it a try. It is considered an \"easy drinking sake\" so it was very light and I wouldn't even say it was sweet at all. It wasn't as flavourful as I had expected.   Our sashimi platter was truly a work of art! (We noticed every sashimi platter that came out of the sushi bar was a little different. Evidently, the chefs put in the time and effort to show some of their creativity in plating.) Our long sashimi platter was nicely decorated with the chef's selection of fresh sashimi, including tako, scallop, clam, and roe, wagyu beef skewers, deep fried fish bones and shrimp heads (all of which were edible). It was served with a premium soy sauce (more salty), a house-made soy sauce (more sweet -- our favourite!), and the wasabi was fresh (we could tell by its grittiness compared to the typical store-bought wasabi paste). Our favourite items were definitely the o-toro, and also, the tako, clam, and wagyu beef skewers. Mmm... It made us want to try the wagyu beef tartar next time!  As for dessert... Despite the big platter of sashimi, I gotta say...there's always room for dessert, especially matcha green tea desserts. The menu included Puchi Choux (green tea and chocolate profiteroles), Kuri Mont Blanc (sweet chestnut cream with pear and hazelnut), Hoji Br√ªl√©e (roasted green tea cr√®me br√ªl√©e), and Matcha Tiramisu. My boyfriend and I ordered the Puchi Choux and Kuri Mont Blanc. Being the most expensive dessert on the menu, the profiteroles were unfortunately quite disappointing! However, the Kuri Mont Blanc made up for it. It was light and fluffy... The combination of chestnut with pear seems strange, but it was really good.  To summarize, the restaurant looks lovely, the service is excellent, and the food is great...for the most part. It is pricey, but you do get what you pay for when it comes to their sashimi. I am not sure I will order another sashimi platter, but I absolutely want to come back to try the wagyu beef tartar and their sushi, especially the Jabistroll!"}
{"text":"After hearing so much rave for this modern Japanese eatery, I finally took a visit to Ja Bistro in the financial district of Toronto. Boasting a menu of ingredients shipped from all over the world and delicately crafted sushi by Chef Koji, the place has racked up a list of loyal customers as well as red carpet celebrities including Scarlett Johansson during TIFF!   ORDERED:  Yukke ($11) - angus beef tartare, gochujang, quail egg, nori seaweed The Yukke beef tartare is served neatly on a wooden board separated into its distinguishable components. After mixing everything up into a homogeneous paste, it is consumed with crispy sheets of nori seaweed.   Sashimi Platter ($50) A chef's selection of fresh fish, this Sashimi Platter cannot be described other than glorious. Seriously. From lobster tomalley to geoduck, every piece of fish is delicately sliced and beautifully presented, only to be exceeded by the way it tastes. So fresh and a heavenly umami in every bite.  Ja Bistroll ($22) - salmon, snow crab, uni, cucumber, tobiko Ja Bistro has a couple different rolls to choose from, but we went ahead with the namesake JaBistroll. I like to think that it has the characteristics of a melty tub of ice cream: creamy and unstructured. The charred fish on top gives it a slight smokey flavour, but is largely overtaken by the sharp flavours and mushy texture of uni and mayonnaise. Oddly enough I enjoyed it, despite not falling under my normal taste and texture preferences.   Gindara ($22) - black cod, bacon, shrimp toast An order of the Gindara black cod comes with a perfectly cooked piece of fish, crusted in bacon, pistachios, and a savoury-sweet glaze. The shrimp toast was a tad bit oily, but packed a flavourful crunch alongside the fish.   Conclusion? Amazing. Stick with the simplistic sashimi and sushi platters, and it'll be worth all the hype. Prepare for nothing less than the best cuts of fish and innovating dishes.   JUST GO."}
{"text":"I don't usually rank places full stars and I usually come on yelp account to complain about things (woops). But boy, this place was amazing. I made reservation for my mom's birthday before our ballet show on a Wednesday night. We went a bit early and there was a line outside of the place, good sign! The fishes were amazingly fresh, they tasted really sweet. I would definitely recommend the lobster sashimi platter, every piece was absolutely perfection.  would definitely go back later. It was the first time I went there and I was pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"The sushi platter is fresh and presented beautifully.  My favorite was the torched sushi; and normally I don't even eat raw fish.  The duck salad and deep fried prawns were outstanding. The deep fried chicken tasted okay, but I wouldn't re-order because you can get that quality for much less $ at other Japanese places.   The cocktails and virgin cocktails were delicious.  We had a baby with us. She didn't cry or make much noise and was sitting in her car seat. The staff accommodated us and our waiter was playful with her. I saw pervious reviews about the manager not being friendly with babies. He frowned at us when we were leaving.   But all in all we would go back. Probably on a date night without baby because the ambiance is romantic yet contemporary."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I've been to Japan numerous time and every time I will travel over to the fish market. The fish from this place is definitely comparable to Japan. Considering Toronto is no where near the ocean, it is not easy to find a place that can serve super fresh fish. The only down side is this place is quite pricey so I will only come here for special occasion."}
{"text":"Lunch at JaBistro is something I would actively avoid. Prices are high, selection low, and food was mediocre. The best of the lot was their demi-katsu sandwich, the least of it was their signature roll. Lunch, I would give a 2-star rating.  Dinner was much, much, better. I had their omakase and I found that to be good value; it had decent fish, a good selection, and plentiful. Bonus points on good shari. I would give this a 3-star rating.  The room is nice with yellow wood and modern black accents. The lighting is subdued, but not overly dark. They did a good job with bringing that all together.  I don't regret going to dinner (let's not talk about lunch), but wouldn't return. Would consider returning if friends wanted to go though."}
{"text":"This place is very intimate.  I always love to go to this restaurant.  I love the service. best service.  the sashimi platter is great.  The blowtorched sushi is always good!!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in Toronto, and in general outside of Japan."}
{"text":"Was taken to Ja Bistro for my birthday and it was the best sushi I have ever had!!   When my partner made the reservation, she mentioned it was a birthday celebration, and when we arrived we were greeted with a champagne cocktail. So sweet! (I still don't know if it was the restaurant or my partner who thought of it, but either way, it was a perfect way to start the meal!)  We shared the Ja Bistro Platter to start, then the Aburicious so we could try the aburi style. The salmon was so amazing - with thinly sliced jalape√±o pepper and a perfectly balanced glaze.  We loved the salmon so much we ordered a whole salmon oshi!   The service was just right - filling our tea and water glasses often, clearing plates at the right time, not crowding the table - plus  they were happy to explain their style of sushi and help us design the first aburi experience.  We ordered dessert and when it came out, they had written \"Happy Birthday Michelle\" on it - a very sweet touch.  We were not rushed out, in fact we had to cut them off from refilling our teas!"}
{"text":"...The room at JB is sexy, bright and clean. Unlike its sister restaurant, Guu, as well as practically every other restaurant we've visited lately, the noise is at an optimal buzz. I can hear my partner, I can hear the background tunes, and I don't wake up the next day sounding like a 60 year old chain-smoker. It's incredible how much more comfortable the experience becomes when I'm not fighting a roaring speaker to get my drink order in right. Not only is the ambiance comfortable, but the temperature is cozy as well. With the door far from most of the seating, and a second door shielding diners the -20 F wind, I can confidently abandon my extra sweater and dine pleasantly in a flowy blouse. Within moments of being sat, one of our servers (there seemed to be many throughout the night) welcomed us with sincere regard and offered us water or tea. The rest of the evening followed theme with genuine concern, hospitality and smiles. Even the chefs were inviting and warm, accepting a shot of Sake from us with an honest bow, and later treating us to some of the pickled burdock he was prepping for his mis en place. On the servers' end, cocktails were promptly delivered, and our glasses were consistency refilled (both with sake and hot water for tea). Similarly, food emerged from the kitchen at a brisk but comfortable pace, getting us in and out in 1 hour 20 minutes without ever feeling rushed. While we shared encounters with several staff members throughout the night, each one seemed equally eager to please, responding to menu questions with confidence or promptly confirming answers with more experienced colleagues. This communication was especially made evident through the careful attention of the bar. While my server had done an incredible job recommending and describing cocktails and sake, the young bartender made a point to stop by our seats to reinforce our choices. And I'm glad he did, because with head bartender, J.R. Graham (of Parts and Labour), offering 15 sakes, an international selection of wine, shochu, beer and about 10 housemade cocktails, the were no shortage of temptations to submit to. After starting with a smooth and belly-warming green tea, he ended up opting for the 10 oz bottle of 60% Ryozeki Yamahal and later a beautiful Umeshu Plum Wine from Japan. Utilizing ingredients like house melon liqueur, pomegranate shochu, matcha syrup, and shiso, my eye was drawn straight to Graham's cocktails so I sampled both the JaBistro Slipper (house melon liqueur, Cointreau, lemon, maraschino cherry) and PCT (pomegranate shochu, Cointreau, tequila). The former was floral and refreshing with a real (that is, not sugar-soaked florescent) maraschino cherry waiting to bring satisfaction to the otherwise disappointment of concluding a tasty drink. The latter was the bartenders special, and like the first cocktail, was neither heavy nor too sweet, but it could have done well with a little sour note to liven it up a touch. Unlike the extensive and explanatory drink menu, the food offerings (broken into sashimi, sushi and bistro fare) were stated with minimal descriptions (i.e. sashimi platter). After some deliberation, and a bit of consultation with our server and the chef, we decided to share the following:  Kani: Soft Shell Crab with Chili ($15)  A generous serving of tempura battered crab portioned into equal 3-bite servings and perched upon a bed of what was described to us as \"chili\". As I eagerly attacked the layers of crackling golden crust, I was met with a scorching hot explosion of moisture and meat. I feverishly fanned the flames and switched over to the more tepid chili. While the chili was fresh and light, the whole dish screamed for more assertive flavours. There was no heat, no sweet, no acid to cut the heavy fry-action, and I wished the whole dish had been more assertively seasoned so I could appreciate the should-be delight of being deep-fried. A good dish with addictive potential, but needing a little work.   Jabistroll: Salmon, Snow Crab, Uni, Cucumber, Tobiko ($22) I enjoyed the textural contrast of it's exquisite pop of the tobiko against the tender grains of shari. Inside, however, I found it's contents lacking structure. While I admit I'm no expert with the chopsticks, both my parter and I found the pieces a little hard to keep together.  More importantly, while the menu description promised cucumber, I longed for a more definitive crunch of a fresh or pickled vegetable component against the overwhelming number of soft components.  From a flavour perspective, however, the roll was one of the best I've ever tasted, with the creamy uni and delicately sweetness of the salmon and crab balanced out by the salty roe...."}
{"text":"Food/Drink Food section of the menu wasnt that various compare to other common sushi places. No udons, or donburis if i can recall correctly. Me and my gf got a sashimi platter($50), kyukyoku sushi(11pcs), and a set of mixed sushi and roll. All of the sashimi were amazing especially the middle part(?) of tuna just melted in your mouth. Never knew i can experience this kind of taste in Toronto. They even have their own house wasabi and theirs really tasted unique and spiced up my nose in a good way. As someone who barely eats sushi with wasabi, this changed my view of wasabi for sure. Sushi were already marinated with their house soy sauce which was sweeter. Food overall were fantastic. The drink menu was filled with  different types of sakes, cocktails, and all sorts of Japanese drinks. Our bartender, Kevin, was very attentive and nice. He would ask our personal taste and let us try some of sake samples except that they werent really sample size; he gave us full shots!! We got the End Silver Sake which was really clean and nice to drink. Kevin was also nice enough to explain all the food in details. He also gave us a nice HUGE sample of Yuzu Sake which is the bomb. Overall, nothing disappointed us!  Environment The place wasnt big. Its definitely better to book a table or seomthing before visiting so you dont end up at a sushi bar or the cocktail bar.(BUT we had so much fun time there with our bartender  explaining and showing whats popular in the kitchen and whats not).   Price For ayce lovers, turn ur back. The  sashimi Platter was already 50 dollars and with all the drinks, the total bill sort of shook me but in the end, this is regarded as one of the luxury,high end Japanese bars in the city."}
{"text":"Please stick to sushi and nigri only.. We had their agedashi which is basically cheap fried oysters with seasonal vegetables (2 pieces of eggplant and spring onion tempura) served with a sauce of soy sauce and vinegar... Just a very disgusting dish... We even told the server about it and she refused to take it off the bill.. Server didn't have any idea about kind of sushi platter she served.. also we asked the server to replace the dish two kind of sushi instead of 3, she completely refuse to serve that and even refused to ask the chef if that was possible...just inconsiderate and rude server. We were even ready to pay extra for it.. So if you are looking for great experience (ambience, great service and great food), stick to other high end sushi restaurant that serve great Japanese food."}
{"text":"4.5 stars!  The menu at JaBistro has 3 sections - sushi, sashimi and \"bistro\" which included items such as black cod, ebi shrimp, calamari and angus tartare. Before I go any further, this really isn't your typical sushi joint. While the d√©cor and atmosphere doesn't shout fancy and expensive, don't be fooled. The prices are high... if you're ordering sushi or sashimi, you'll be spending a lot. But you get what you pay for.  What went in my belly:  Kamo - smoked duck breast, burdock, onsen tamago ($14) which came in the form of a salad. The duck was tender and had a subtle smokey flavour to it. The dish was centered around a poached egg with a yolk which spilled into the dish after being cut into. I liked it!  Sashimi Platter ($100). There's also a $50 platter. I inquired about the difference between the two and was told it isn't a difference in quantity but rather a difference in the quality of fish. It was a special occasion so we decided to splurge. The sashimi was served on a slate and the sashimi included uni, toro, salmon belly, amberjack, sea bream, lobster and fish jelly. Everything was incredibly fresh and just ridiculously good! Yes, the price is quite steep for not a whole lot of food but the quality really is top notch!  Lobster Miso Soup. I'm not usually a fan of miso soup but I ate the entire bowl of this one!   JaBistroll - salmon, snow crab, uni, cucumber and tobiko ($22). Like everything else here, it's pricier than your average roll but well worth it. It had a bit of a smoky flavour, saltiness from the tobiko, crunch from the cucumber...and deliciousness from the salmon, crab and uni. A real flavour punch!  Aburi - 7 sushi pieces blowtorched ($27). This sampler of sushi came with a combination of nigiri - sea bream, amberjack, sweet shrimp and salmon belly and pressed sushi - tiger shrimp, mackerel and tamago.  My favourite was the mackerel (next time I'd just get an order of this only).  Like I said, the place is pricey...so save it for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"To start this off, I was excited to try this restaurant because I heard and saw great reviews here but I have to say I rather go somewhere else and not come back to this place.   My friends , party of 8 including myself ordered the Fisherman Platter $400 for 6 ppl addition people is a cost of $70 So just for this \"tasting\" it cost us $540 ( not including tax )  I would like to mention that my bf had made reservations and advised that this was a special occasion and it was for my birthday all a surprise, reservation was made for 5:30, all my friends got there at that time, but i was 15mins late, they wanted to start the tasting without me !!!! Not to mention that afterwards my bf told me the take down your credit card for reservation and advised if you don't show up for the reservation they will charge you in full for the meal !!!!!!!  When I first walked into the restaurant the hostess didn't smile or didn't seem nice she had that very cocky look didn't ask if it was our first time etc.  Decor is very modern, and long  When the first course came i was really excited to try, presentation was super good and the taste of every dish was good but it all stopped there  First dish contained ( all 1 bite ) Toro and lobster sashimi  very fresh and good, follow by a fry black cod coated in some batter that seems like it was over fried..it tasted burnt..wasn't to pleasant , following that was smoked duck breast, very juicy and flavorful loved it, then octopus and salmon mixed when red onion ..was refreshing..  but the good part of the meal ends here !!!  2nd Course ( grilled whole snapper with vegetables ) It was very messy, it was a huge fish and your suppose to wrap it it boston lettuce ( which came with the dirty end of it where there was soil and roots still attached..) We expected them to at least serve the portions of the fish...but they didn't..and there were scales in every bite of the fish... overall..the fish was fresh..but it wasn't to pleasing to eat with scales in ur mouth..nothing to wow about  3rd course ( lobster sandwich and mussels ) Lobster came in a hot dog bun...Mmm..It tasted like the ones I would get from McDs at PEI...lobster didn't have seasoning..bun just reminded me a hotdog..presentation was so sloppy. Then the mussels..the portion that we received after dividing it among the party of 8...we didn't even get 2pcs each .....really?? not even 2...we didn't enjoy it at all  4th course..sushi ( toro, hamachi, mackerel, salmon ) The rice was falling apart..and every nigiri seemed like it was marinated so everything just tasted so heavy..Not to mention sushi doesn't come with extra soy sauce of wasabi ! over all..nothing to wow..AGAIN..  5th course ( strawberry cake ) the cake tasted just like an average normal cake you can purchase anywhere..the sponge cake part was dry..we didn't enjoy it at all..we enjoyed our own birthday cake instead.  THE CHARGE FOR YOU CUTTING YOUR CAKE AT THEIR RESTAURANT !!! $30 !!!!!!!!!!!! THERE IS SOMETHING CALLED CAKE FEEE !!!  I have never came across of anything fee called cake fee anywhere in the world !! Not to mention they didn't even come by with a birthday greeting ..so song..nothing...and they charge you for that...ridiculous !!!  On their website the bottle of wine we ordered states $28 but we got charged $69  The guys at dinner weren't full at all, the only reason we were full was due to our own cake that we ate at the end...  When we asked if they had comment cards? suggestion box? feedback or anything like that? we were informed by the waiter they don't have such thing....Well I guess they think of themselves so high up, doesn't matter what we say or feel, because after asking for it he didn't even bother to ask what was wrong with the service tonight even tho we answered it was corrective errors...no apology  Overall I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is looking for authentic japanese experience of food, or maybe I just came with high expectations.  Our bill came up to $840.00, and with that price i am sure i could get better service and food anywhere else."}
{"text":"I have been to a lot of sushi restaurants in Toronto and this is by far my favourite. Fish is so fresh, aburi is delicious. I've been here three times and next time I'll be trying the sashimi platter! Scallop here is to die for."}
{"text":"Pricey but in my opinion worth the price. It can get busy and food may take awhile to arrive, but the torched sushi is delicious. Personally I enjoy it better than Ki.  Decorations are very trendy for an upper end restaurant. I wouldn't recommend for a larger group as the restaurant is so small, hard to get a spot.  Get a seat at the bar to watch the chefs torch the sushi, it's awesome."}
{"text":"JaBistro is the best sushi in the city.  Sat at the bar and witnessed an artisanal masterclass in Japanese culinary creativity. Despite wanting to eat everything on the menu, this is how it went down..  Agedashi - hot crispy chunks of tofu in a light tasting tentsuyu broth. Nice start to the meal.  $100 sashimi platter - the main event. Picked this over the $50 platter because of the quality of the fish. It included different cuts of toro (ranging from fatty, to medium fatty, to akami), seared kobe beef (just butter in your mouth), lobster, sea bream, uni, salmon roe, octopus, squid.. and I basically got lost after the toro.  Aburi - 7 pieces of melt in your mouth sushi. All blowtorched. It's not easy sharing 7 pieces with one other person but because I'm a nice guy, I surrendered. (http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ls90ihUbol1r21bdno1_250.gif) Within these 7 pieces, there was one shining star that stood out from the rest. The salmon nigiri. This knocked me the f out. Floored. Dare I say, the best thing I've ever put in my mouth. We ordered 2 extra pieces.  Eunice, our awesome server, came by with dessert menus but we skipped it in order to preserve the salmon nigiri flavour still lingering in our mouths."}
{"text":"JaBistro is hands down one of the higher end places in Toronto for Japanese food. The food is pricey but fresh, made with care, and very high quality. Even the fresh green tea was pricey but it was authentic grinded up tea leaves from Japan.   The servers were very attentive but not annoying (as in they didn't hang around watching you eat food).They were very knowledgeable, provided recommendations since it was my first time here and answered all the questions we had so we felt comfortable ordering.   Service 5/5 Food 5/5  Everything 5/5!"}
{"text":"Yes, this place is good and probably one of the best/ better sushi restaurants in DT Toronto, BUT the quality is inconsistent AND it could really use some AC because it's a very stuffy restaurant!   Having been to JaBistro 3 times in the past 4 months, I really enjoyed the first two times, but I went again last week and the food was not up to standard. I moved from NYC around a year ago and I have been craving good sushi in this city, which seem to be few and far between. My boyfriend and I found JaBistro online and he first took me here for my birthday in February. We ordered what we believed to be a ton of food, including the lobster miso soups, Aburi, Aburicious, etc. PLUS drinks and were incredibly surprised when the bill came out to only around $100! The lobster miso soup is reminiscent of the one at En Japanese Brasserie in NYC. Everything was delicious and we would have gladly paid more than double for the meal.   I quickly established that this was my favorite sushi place in Toronto and brought my colleagues here shortly for a second meal, which was equally excellent. We loved the braised pork belly, the calamari and the Aburicious (especially the ebi sushi!). Even my one colleague who is from Texas and isn't into seafood really enjoyed the meal, and that is how you know it is good! Great sushi is about allowing the inherent taste of the fresh sashimi to come through with the help of subtle garnishes that enhance the flavor of the fish itself, and JaBistro does this very well. This resulted in excellent sushi that has the ability to ignite your tastebuds and remind you why you're spending more on a roll than you are for AYCE sushi. Unfortunately, last week a friend told me she was craving good sushi, and of course I took her straight to JaBistro. But this time, for some reason the Aburicious rolls were incredibly oily. Whenever I picked up a piece, there would actually be puddles of oil residue that remained my plate. Despite my efforts, I was only able to finish 4 out of the 8 pieces and found myself apologizing to my friend for the unexpected slip in quality."}
{"text":"Best sushi I have had in years.... pricey but I am ok paying for high quality raw fish,"}
{"text":"Great service, food.  We ordered six items between two ppl and everything tasted great.  The place is small but is still comfortable.  It made me enjoy Japanese food again given there's a lot of Japanese food that's just sloppy now."}
{"text":"Ja Bistro is in a convenient location and has a cozy and welcoming feel. The service was great, being seated at the sushi bar we weren't sure what to expect, but we had an attentive server. It was a lot of fun being at the bar to watch the sushi chefs work their magic! My favorite thing was the salmon pressed sushi, it was melt in your mouth delicious and I could have kept eating them! Although it's definitely pricey, you can tell the sushi is of great quality. I can't wait to go back and try more items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Really great Lobster Sashimi! Love the atmosphere and great level of service"}
{"text":"Overpriced and service was borderline abysmal.   We knew they were understaffed because the back patio was closed due to \"some staff not working\". But there were enough staff to work the half empty restaurant. We had the only hipster server (coupled with man bun) and perhaps he felt tending for the 5 or so tables he looked after was too much of an ask for a Saturday evening.   10 minutes after sitting he finally bothered to ask for our order. We order some Starters first, telling him that we'd keep looking at the rest of the menu. Starters came, tasted pretty good, got cleared and sat there for 5 more minutes before I asked someone else if we could order more food. Now, if you've ever been there you know it is long and thin - we were sat in front of the sushi chefs so he could not forget about us having to half to walk passed us to serve his other 4 tables.   The host took our next order(the person I grabbed) , which he messed up but the additional dish he brought (costing ~$30) was free. The sushi is a bit weird - they're obsessed with blow torching everything after putting a type of cream cheese on top of it. The fish that was not tainted by the distinct taste of a blowtorch was nice.   The Chef's are skilled but overall the experience was crap, it's pretty steep, and dishes rose to a maximum level of 'pretty good'.   Go elsewhere"}
{"text":"I love Ja.  Really imaginative dishes and awesome cocktails.  Definitely the most unique sushi I have had in the city.  I highly recommend the blowtorched Sushi pieces.  Amazing."}
{"text":"I walked out of the restaurant after seeing what is done here. I'm okay with killing animals for food when it's done humanely, but there is no justification to inflict such incredible suffering upon sentient beings purely to satisfy a lust for novelty.  Serving live food in this manner is disgusting and goes far beyond any ethical boundaries and provides no further benefit to the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday and we were the first ones to arrive. The service is very friendly and there is always someone available to assist you.   Ordered:  Sashimi platter agedashi (Deep fried oysters) aburicious  green tea mojito   I enjoyed all the food items especially the blowtorched sushi in the aburicious. I loved the ebi sushi! I think I will order the ebi oshizushi next time to get more of the ebi!!  The oysters was always a nice appetizer. It was served in a bowl with dashi, with deep fried eggplants and green onions.   As of right now, this is my go-to place for sushi when I am in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"I've been back 3 more times since my initial visit and service is now pretty perfect. They even remembered my allergies and made accommodations proactively. Koji and team are very warm and inviting...not to mention the outstanding sushi.   I'm becoming a regular!  Taste Buds http://www.meetup.com/TorontoTasteBuds/"}
{"text":"I'd really give 4.5 if I could.  Awesome experience, friendly staff, and delicious selection.  Only reason I wouldn't give them 5 stars would be because the omakase experience isn't as direct and personal as it could be. It's set and doesn't really have the chef's input on each piece of fish for you. Other than that, it's great!"}
{"text":"Terrific service, food was amazing! Sashimi was really fresh, sushi was well made. Great atmosphere. Definitely a must try place!"}
{"text":"3.5/5! We went to Ja Bistro on a Tuesday night after hearing raving reviews from some friends. Perhaps we had really high expectations, but I was not as impressed as others. This is definitely more authentic than most other Japanese restaurants in the financial/entertainment district so that's a positive. I highly recommend the sashimi sampler to start. The fish is extremely fresh. However, I was disappointed with the Ja Bistro roll. I have had better maki at other places. The service was good however they messed up our drink menu and we asked several times for extra soya sauce which we never received. Overall, it's a bit pricey for what it is."}
{"text":"We were probably there around the same time as William M but luckily, we didn't have any problems with our reservation.  We did notice that the maitre d' was counting tables when leading us to ours so soft opening indeed.  This will be a short review with that in mind.  We chose kamo (smoked duck breast) and kani (soft shell crab) from the bistro section and tried a few of their rolls: JaBistroll, saba oshizushi and salmon oshizushi.  We also tried their drinks as well ($12 for the alcoholic. $6 for the virgin).  We liked what we had, the oshizushi especially.  It's a short and simple menu so I look forward to seasonal changes and tweakings.  Service and smiles in line with the other Guu restaurants, though (pleasantly) not as boisterous with the incoming or outgoing cheers.  Modern jazz plays in the background (I caught some Jazztronika) of the narrow, elongated floorplan and the noise level was quite tolerable.  Just a pair of single person washrooms in the back, done up in similar vein with the other Guu restaurants.  Table seating was quite cramp the night we went in: there was no way to enter the inner seat without setting aside one's table first.  It would be disappointing if management kept this arrangement for the sake of fitting-in a handful more tables.  As it is, we're a tad too close and intimate with the conversations on either side of us, it somewhat breaks from the cozy, smart, jazz nook feel that everything else suggests.  With less kitchen staff and floor staff than Guu, beware of the much longer delay in between dishes.  Our dinner of two mains, three rolls and two drinks came close to two and a half hours, and the mains arrived at very different times.  I think your best bet is to enter not for a full meal, but to sample and share a few dishes in between drinks and long conversations.  Think of it as a temporary sanctum you walk off the street and escape to for an evening of talk and some good food."}
{"text":"This place is definitely overrated! I made reservations over 2 weeks ago for my mom's birthday. We arrived about 10 minutes early and the hostess seated us at the end of the restaurant near the back, facing the wall where the door to the kitchen was and next to it were the washroom doors. There was also a huge draft. The restaurant was completely full except for a few seats by the bar. About 5-10 minutes later, I asked if we could be moved as some customers had just left and I NEVER, EVER do this but I thought since its my moms birthday and there's a few inconveniences, I don't think its unreasonable. Our waiter talked to the hostess and then came back and said we can't move you at this time because there are 2 people waiting at the doors. He avoided all eye contact after this. Another waiter dropped off our drinks and I asked if we could be moved and he said he would get back to me. Another 5-10 minutes later, they allowed us to move and there was no sight of the 2 people that were supposedly waiting at the doors moments prior. This already left a sour taste in my mouth.   We ordered several times and the food was good but not amazing like my friends had raved about. When we asked for refill of water or any other small requests, we had to ask twice because no one EVER remembered. All in all, the food is good, service is bad and its TOTALLY overpriced for what you are eating and the service you receive."}
{"text":"The service at the restaurant was very nice, they offered to take your bag and coat when you come in.  We ordered the aburicious, black cod, and calamari.  The food was delicious and nicely presented.  However, it fell way short of my expectation for a $50 per person meal."}
{"text":"I came here on a tuesday night without reservation and was able to get a table for 3.  The atmosphere was very up scale and pleasant and right when you walk in I was able to see the sushi chefs preparing orders.    Their menu is simple enough not to overwhelm with too many choices.  We ordered   1) sashimi sampler plate $30 - comes with 12-13 pieces of variety of fish and scallop. It was definitely fresh and include a few types of fish that you don't usually get in normal sushi restaurants.  One drawback is that each piece is very thinly sliced so you can't expect to eat much   2) Aburicious $20 - we upgraded to three servings instead of 2 servings for an extra $10 - one of my favourite dish.  The smokiness of the fish was the highlight and  it really gave some kicks to it  3) Sushi Nama $27 - a variety of different fish but nothing extremely tasty except for the fatty tuna.    4) agedashi $12 - deep fried oyster - nothing really spectacular; it's deep fried but mostly soggy because it's drenched in some sort of broth  5) Ika $10 - fried calamari - great addition to the meal; you can't go wrong with this dish  6) Green tea $4.00 - very strong matcha green tea and you get unlimited hot water refill  Most of the fish you find here would probably be the best I've tasted so far.  It pretty much melts in your mouth without needing the effort to chew.  Final verdict? I would love it better without the price tag for the amount was offered.  Was it worth $150 meal?  I think for the three of us, we would say it was just right and I think it's worth it for the experience."}
{"text":"Went back and had a very poor experience. We ordered a few starters between our group and they were nothing special. The main reason we went was for the sashimi platter, which we had ordered and it was only after an hour of waiting that we were informed it was something that we 'did not order'. I am fairly certain that our group of 4 has a better collective memory than 1 server who had clearly made a mistake. No apologies were made and in return no further reservations will ever happen from myself or friends. Congratulations to a staple favourite for alienating their regular customers."}
{"text":"Came here tonight to celebrate my fiance's birthday.  I decided to do the tasting menu because I heard from friends it was a good sampler of the kind of food they had and since we've never been at jabistro before it would be a good sort of introduction to the restaurant and if we were still hungry, we could always order a la carte.    The first course was 5 dishes including lobster miso soup, tempura oysters, pan fried salmon, a selection of sashimi and I think it was some sort of deep fried fish (couldn't hear the name of it from the waitress).    The lobster miso was delicious.  It was so sweet and full of lobster flavour!  The tempura oysters were also fantastic.  The sashimi was so fresh....it was melt in your mouth good.   The only things we didn't like were the salmon which we felt was slightly overdone but still moist and the deep fried fish as it was overly salty.   The second course was a sushi platter which was probably the highlight of our meal.  There were 4 blow torched sushi and 3 raw pieces.  Out of all the ones we were served, we loved the tuna belly the most - this was probably the best sushi we've had in Toronto.  We also got raw rainbow trout and jumbo prawn and blow torched prawn, mackerel, salmon, and jabistroll. The other sushi were fantastic as well but both my fiance and I felt that the tuna belly was the best.    To conclude our meal we had dessert which was a red bean jelly or pudding with green tea ice cream.  The red bean jelly/ pudding didn't taste like red bean...in fact it tasted like \"san cha bang\" (those little red circle wafer things that you get at chinese supermarkets).  Anyway...the dessert was ok...definitely not the highlight of the meal but a nice way to end it.  They also asked me when I made the reservation whether this was for a special occasion and I told them it was my fiance's birthday so they wrote out happy birthday to him on the dessert plate which was a nice touch.     At the end of the tasting menu, I was actually really full and my fiance was satisfied.  We definitely felt that it was worth the $55 per person and enjoyed our meal enough to say that we would definitely come back to try other things on the a la carte menu."}
{"text":"Happy belated valentines day! Hope you all had a wonderful one! For this special occasion, JW and I decided to visit JaBistro, a new Japanese restaurant added to the chain of restaurants opened by the owner of Guu, James Kim.  One thing I want to mention is that JaBistro's menu was rather simple -  there were only sashimi platters, sushi sets and their special salad/cooked dishes. There wasn't a list of a la carte sushi/sashimi or daily fresh fish that they offer. If we didn't sit at the bar and eye at the sushi that the chef was making, we wouldn't know that wagyu sushi exists! So remember to ask your server for recommendations or if you are interested in a particular type of fish.  We began our adventure at JaBistro with Wagyu sushi and Blue Fin Tuna Otoro sushi. These two sushi totally blew our minds off and this was exactly how we expected our journey at JaBistro should be.  A good otoro sushi in a Japanese meal is like the cherry on top, it just perfects everything & JaBistro did it just right. The otoro sushi instantly melted and the fish oil just kept on squirting into our mouths. The amount of rice was just right that every single piece of rice was covered with fish oil. What a wonderful piece.  We have never had Wagyu Sushi before so JW was very excited to try this. When ordered, our server asked whether we want the wagyu to be served raw or torched. We decided to have ours slightly torched in order to bring out the flavour in the meat.  The Wagyu sushi was absolutely overwhelming and quickly became our favourite dish of the night. The wagyu was extremely tender and seemed like it would melt in our mouths. After a few bites, the juice was slowly released from the meat and was very very tasty and flavourful. When mixed with the rice, it was just mind-blowing.   Next, we had the sashimi platter with lobster. There was a generous amount of different sashimi, and most importantly, lobster sashimi. And of course, they were very fresh.JaBistro offered three kinds of dipping - a sweet soy sauce, sea salt with lemon and a premium soy sauce. We enjoyed the sweet soy sauce a lot. It was slightly sweeter than normal soy sauce and helped to elevate the freshness of the sashimi. On a side note, the wasabi was freshly ground by the chef.  The upper half of the lobster from the sashimi platter was made into a miso soup. It arrived our table close to the end as it was freshly made upon orders. The soup was very sweet compared to ordinary miso soup because of the lobster. Even for me who doesn't like miso soup, I enjoyed it a lot.  We also ordered Kani ( soft shell crab with chilli). The soft shell crab was nicely fried and crispy. The juice from the crab was locked inside the crab and started dripping once we bit into it. The chilli added a nice dimension to the crab otherwise it would be rather plain on its own. Overall, it was very delicious and I would like to try more of the cooked dishes from JaBistro next time as many of the combinations are totally new and unheard of (i.e. Black Cod, Bacon and shrimp toast).  We also had the aburi sushi set which came with 7 blowtorched sushi including JaBistro's special ebi, saba and salmon oshizushi. I would recommend this dish to anyone who visit JaBistro as you can try all of their special sushi and, needless to say, they were amazing. Torched sushi always bring out that special power in ordinary sushi and bring them onto another level.  We really enjoyed to ebi and salmon oshizushi from the aburi sushi set that we ordered half of each afterwards. Oshizushi is different from ordinary sushi as all the ingredients are packed inside a box and pressed very hard until they form into a rectangular prism. Although the oshizushi was pressed very hard, the sushi rice did not become too firm or mushy at all. It remained its softness and a reasonably amount of space between the rice. The texture was extraordinary. Very impressive. For the Ebi oshizushi, mayo with pesto was added to the sushi and torched and went very well with the crisp texture of the shrimp. The salmon oshizushi was torched with mayo and a piece of Jalapeno was then added on top to add a hint of spiciness to the salmon. They were equally delicious and I will definitely order them again next time.  We finished off this amazing meal with Ringo, Fuji apple compote and vanilla ice cream. Although the apple compote was slightly bitter, the vanilla ice cream balanced it off so the apple was not too bitter and the dessert was not too sweet. I love this dessert, especially with all the almond and pistachio layered on top.  verdict:   roasted.   I wish I can come here everyday but it is impossible given its price haha. But it is just simply amazing and we will definitely come back, especially for their JaBistro roll as it wasn't available this time. So once a month hopefully? :)  visit http://theroastedacorn.com/2013/02/18/jabistro/ for awesome pictures of the food i mentioned :)"}
{"text":"The best Japanese interpetation of kool and explosive flavors in downtown West. The portions were ample and the presentation perfect. Staff were respectful and eager to please. But wait, there's more!  You got to try their version of Tarimisu. It is like grest sex in a tall glass. Erotic, smooth, and fun.  DEFINITELY A MUST GO BACK TOO!!!"}
{"text":"Great quality that's very consistent! Love the Ja bistro roll and the tori nanban!  The green tea with ginger is very warming too, our all time favourite!"}
{"text":"Awesome charred sushi (whatever that style is called).  If the prices were lower I'd be back more often, but I don't like spending a small fortune on lunch."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday and sat at the counter with my hubby. The food here is great! It is the best sushi restaurant I have tried in Toronto so far, but not the best I have ever had (best sushi is Sushi Dai in Tokyo!). This place is pricey but the food is excellent quality for Toronto.   $50 sashimi platter with lobster added - nice variety of seafood, ranging from extremely fresh and large spot prawns (my fav on this plate cause it is so buttery) to tuna and salmon. The lobster is a great deal since it was only $10 more and you get 2 lobster miso soups with it which were nice (not too salty). I feel like some of the fishes on this platter can be fresher like the tuna but overall it was good.  Beef tartar - pleasant but was not outstanding, the bread to meat ratio is off, we were really generous with topping our bread pieces with meat and still had lots of meat left over with no bread.  Nama - 7pieces of sushi, the rice was a nice texture, not mushy and has a nice vinegar ratio. Rice to seafood ratio was good, the sushi here is very comparable to a slight above average sushi place in Japan (but quite a distance from the best ones).  Aburi - 7 pieces of blow torch sushi, I ordered this on a friend's recommendation but I must say I did not love it since the cooking from the blowtorch took away the endogenous natural taste of the fish and also changed the texture in an undesirable manner. These pieces also were adulterated with mayo topping for the pressed sushis. I guess for me the raw seafood complemented with mild soy glazes or a bit of ginger or wasabi or scallion depending on the seafood is what I love. So this was a miss for me.  Service was attentive but not intruding. I quite like this place and right now it ranks the best in downtown Toronto for sushi and sashimi for me. Hopefully this focus on quality sushi trend is an upward trend, maybe one day Toronto can have a sushi restaurant close to the level of Sushi Dai in Tokyo."}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service!! Wonderful night at jaBistro!! Having the birthday dinner there and feel so happy!! Will go there again!! Love lobster platter and sushi"}
{"text":"When I am craving good quality sushi in Toronto, I come to JaBistro. When I have friends or family visiting who are craving sushi in Toronto, I bring them to JaBistro.  Personal favourites are the oshizushi such as the salmon pressed sushi and shrimp pressed sushi. I went to visit the west coast this past summer (Seattle, Vancouver) and there hasn't been a place that has impressed me more than JaBistro in terms of pressed sushis. I usually try to save this place for a special occasion since you can easily spend over $100 per meal if, but sometimes I would indulge myself and go in just to order these two rolls as an appetizer before restaurant hopping to another place for dinner.   Aside from the oshizushi, I've really enjoyed their lobster platter (it comes with lobster miso soup) and their kyukyoku (sushi chef selection). Quality is comparable to places in the west coast like Shiro's in Seattle. Their desserts and drinks are also delicious.  JaBistro is a must-try for any foodie in GTA!"}
{"text":"I have one word to describe JaBistro. Oshi! Translation ~ delicious! The service was great. The serving staff were all Japanese (this is extra points for me). Our server had this little ear piece she used to talk to the kitchen while they coordinated orders. It was a lot of fast talking with the occasional 'arigato', I got  real kick out of it. I brought a friend from Japan, who they immediately made feel at home. No crappy hipster staff here. These people are pros and really care about doing a good job. The sashimi was fresh and delicious and the pressed sushi (lightly seared with a torch) was amazing! The rooftop patio was really cool as well. Price is a bit high, so best for a special occasion or really hot date."}
{"text":"We were craving for some sushi and on our way to Nathan Phillips decided to stop here (had already bookmarked this as interesting on Yelp). It was a Friday lunch and, while there were already several small groups seated, they had a couple of tables left and we were seated immediately. The place is quite small so I guess it's best to book if you don't want to be disappointed, at least for when the place might be busier (dinner and weekends?).  We asked for suggestions and since we wanted sushi, were suggested the kyukyoku, which was fantastic (best we have personally ever eaten although that doesn't say much). Definitely filled our craving.  We also had the aburicious and that was amazing, blowtorched sushi. I do not know if it's their specialty because it was the first time I ate something like that, but it was absolutely delicious. A melt-in-your-mouth texture and an explosion of flavours. Next time it will definitely be our main course! Little, yet stylish and welcoming place with extremely attentive service and great food!"}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant- more than Miku! The fish was really fresh, and I loved their aburi salmon roll. As well as the lobster miso soup.  So good!"}
{"text":"My must go-to restaurant when I'm downtown Toronto and craving for good Japanese food! This restaurant has one of the best Japanese fusion dishes! I've been here for 3 times dine-in and 1 time take-out and their quality of food has never disappointed me. The price could be pricey but their overall experience was amazing and I would always come back. I recommend small parties because their spaces are limited, but really cozy for couples who enjoy Japanese food!"}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious, and expertly crafted flavours in this modernized Japanese restaurant. The main focus is seafood, generally raw, or slightly seared aburi style. They do aburi oshizushi right. The blowtorching of the raw salmon gives it a slight smokiness and brings out more of the rich and fatty salmon flavours to create a a sensation that is somewhat between sashimi and grilled salmon. Yum. And that was just one example.  All bites were delicious and beautiful to look at.  There are often daily specials, or you can ask for chef's choice if you want even fresher. Fish are flown in on a semi regular basis, so beware locavores. For those who enjoy their food a little more cooked, there are additional offerings on the menu, but my dinner companions and I only went for the sushi and sashimi, which were all excellent.  Though a slightly more expensive dinner than a local sushi joint, it felt like good value for what you were getting. And I can't wait to go back.."}
{"text":"Simply the best Japanese option in the downtown area. I ordered the Platter and the Aburi. Makes my mouth water just thinking about it....."}
{"text":"I went on two different occasions and the food quality was amazing both times. The prices are great for the quality. The torched sushi is amazing. The presentation and service were both also great as well."}
{"text":"Friendly service and great food. Highly recommend the sashimi platters, add a lobster and they will save the lobster head for the miso soup for you! Another favourite is the Jabistroll, a blowtorched sushi roll, very rich in flavour. The presentation of dishes are amazing. They are definitely on the more pricey side but you get what you pay for! Much better than places like Hapa Izakaya. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Really fresh fish but pricey, toro and Chu-toro is to die for they literally melt in your mouth."}
{"text":"I can't believe it took me this long to try out one of the best sushi restaurants in Toronto.  The restaurant is right beside the Yuk Yuk's comedy club on Richmond St. From the same owners as Guu, they did a great job at keeping the earth tones in the d√©cor but did not keep the loud Guu Izakaya atmosphere. Thank goodness!   I made reservations to sit at the bar since I wanted to be where the action was. We got a sweet seat in front of Chef Koji Tashiro where I thoroughly enjoyed watching him blow torch the rolls and seeing him work his magic behind the bar. I looked at the menu at home a thousand times, so I knew what I wanted.  The menu prices are high but you truly get what you pay for, well at least for the fish.  The 4 things I would highly recommend getting at Jabistro are:  1.The sashimi sampler platter. For $50, my husband shared a platter that was just exceptional and creative!   If you can afford it or have a larger party, I'd recommend going for the $100 platter as there is more variety and the plating will just blow you away! I saw a few parties order it and I was mesmerized every time it came out of the kitchen.  2. Yukke (angus beef tartare). I loved the chunky beef mixed with the spicy Korean gochujang with quail egg, served with nori.   3. Any of the blow torched sushi rolls! The blow torch enhances the taste and allows the juices to run into the roll, while having a seared taste. Our JaBistroroll was full of flavour and the uni provided a depth of creaminess.  4. Get a drink! (No, not just water or pop). JaBistro stocks amazing Japanese liquers and sake. They also have a fully decked bar and an awesome bartender. I ordered the super smooth Seikyo sake and the bartender's creation called \"noble cherry\", made with gin and nigori sake. My husband enjoyed his refreshing 'virgin spicy celery lime' drink.  We also ordered the tori nanban which is battered chicken with tartare sauce. I would recommend eating this as soon as it arrives, otherwise the batter quickly gets soggy from the tartare sauce. Flavours were delicious otherwise.  The sashimi and sushi are definitely the stars of this restaurant, where every plate is a piece of art.  This will be my go-to restaurant when I want to splurge for quality and delicious sushi!   Maybe next time, I will try their tasting menu."}
{"text":"This is one of the best sushi places I have ever been to! The fish is extremely fresh and buttery and also straight from Japan. I highly recommend you check this place out as the atmosphere is also really cool and trendy."}
{"text":"We were here last week for lunch, since my husband took a week off, we decided to go and try their omakase lunch.  Reservation were made online using their website system, which make things a lot more easier.      Upon arrival, the lady direct us to our seat was very accommodating as we went there with a baby stroller, she helped us parked it at the front, so it won't be in the way with other customer.  We were there at 12:00pm, it wasn't busy at all, there were only a few tables.    Our waiter was friendly and can make really good non-alcoholic drinks fm the menu.  We order the mojito green tea and some lychee drink, tasted real good.  On to the food, we were served a sample platter fm the omakase, which included lobster bisque, a pc of grilled fish, karage and some sashimi.  They were all really good.  For the main, they offered few pcs of sushi and few blow torched pressed sushi.  They were the best blow torched sushi we ever had, it was really fresh, all the sushi were already seasoned with soy sauce or their special sauce.  We had also ordered an extra plate of waygu beef torched pressed sushi to try, but this one was't that impressive, it was only ok to our liking.  And finally, the dessert were green tea ice-cream and hojicha creme brulee, creme brulee was torched to perfection.  Gotta say, we will go back and try their dinner one day.  It was such a great expensive for us."}
{"text":"took my parents there tonight who came to visit from abroad. They know their sushi and japanese food. I have to say what a lovely little place. Extremely Fresh sushi , and very delicious . Especially the blow torch selection, although some were  a tad bit greasy due to the mayonaise (which im not a fan of in sushi) , but other than that superb food.   Service was highly attentive and very courteous, literally on top of their game.  my only complaints would be:  -the wooden single seats are a bit uncomfortable  -prices are a bit high   again minor complaints to be honest, as its about the food and service and with regards to those 2 this place has greatly exceeded expectations.    Well done guys!"}
{"text":"Food is great , and every dishes has a nice presentation.  But the sashimi lobster platter , nama sushi , Aburi Sushi was sold out at that night . So , We don't have too much choice from the menu . This is a kind of disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing food and even better service. The torched sushi rolls are delicious and a must try. Sashimi is always very fresh, especially the lobster sashimi. The sashimi set will take some parts of the lobster for the soup which is also amazing."}
{"text":"Atmospherics: Sleek and modern interior. Perfect place for a business meeting, date, or catching up with friends.  Service: Friendly, attentive and hospitable. Straight to business type of service which I appreciate.   The Order:  Sashimi lobster platter, aburicious, black cod, and various additional sashimi.   Food: The quality is definitely there however I was hoping for some rare or bold sashimi cuts. The portions in the sashimi platter could've been a bit larger. The adjoining lobster miso soup was a bit disappointing; it lacked natural flavour and the lobster claw didn't feel fresh.  The signature roll was tasty but nothing extraordinary.   Experience: Overall I enjoyed my evening there. The service and food was prompt. I would only return if a client or good friend wanted to check it out otherwise I didn't find anything that would draw me back again. Rating: 3.75/5"}
{"text":"Probably the best sushi i've had in Toronto so far. The quality of the food was so fresh, and presentation was very high class. Service was amazing too! Definitely one of the more expensive joints but you really do get what you pay for. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"So good! Came here for a weeknight dinner with mom. Nice decor and location but I thought the seats were a little too tightly packed together.  As for the food, we ordered a couple of nigiri and an aburi which is 7 pieces of torched nigiri of the chef's choice. The highlight of the dinner was definitely the aburi as every single piece was delicious. The others were all decently good and my mom thought the shiro ebi nigiri was her favorite. Service was also great.  My only complaint is that the menu is very limited and there really arent many choices. It's a good choice if you really value fresh, good quality seafood over variety."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, not too much people there.  Had chef's choice, for 9 pieces, $47 seems pricey, but they were soooo fresh, really worth to try!  Also had Aburicious, which has 4 different kinds of aburi style sushi. I tried aburi sushi in Miku before, Personally I love JaBistro's, which is more flavorful and not oily.  They gave me a piece of cheesecake even if I didn't order one since it was my birthday, which was a big surprise!"}
{"text":"Our annual New Year's tradition starts at Jabistro! We have been coming here for 3 straight years now and have always left satisfied and happy! Fish is fresh, rice is firm and service is excellent. We ordered two Kyukyoku (11 pieces each: yellowtail, ocean trout, madai, kanpachi, akami (tuna loin), chutoro, otoro, black cod, squid, kinmedai, and wagyu) and the Wagyu pressed sushi. So delicious! We recommend sitting at the sushi bar for the best experience!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed JaBistro. My family and I went in the middle of February for my birthday. The place is small and gets quite busy but it was fine. The music was fantastic, the food was amazing! It was so fresh and while much of it was very authentic (a very good thing!) some was very unique. All of it was tasty and left a lasting impression. The staff was very nice and the manager came over before we were about to leave to ask us about the experience and wish me a happy birthday. It was expensive but the quality was there and we ordered quite a bit because it was a special occasion and none of us had eaten anything that day lol! I would definitely recommend. Tip: if you want a bit quieter experience go when it opens, it's not as busy like it gets around 6:30 and on."}
{"text":"Restaurant: JaBistro Cuisine: Japanese Location: Entertainment District Address: 222 Richmond St W Price Range: $15~  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 4 Service: 4 Ambiance: 4 Overall: 4  Extra information:  * Takes reservation * Open for lunch (Mon~Fri) * Vegetarian friendly * Closed on Sunday * Open late on Friday & Saturday  It was way back in early January when I visited JaBistro for my birthday. Couple food bloggers had already paid a visit and people were going insane over it, I just couldn't wait. It was a friday night and we went quite early in the evening since we had plans after. We made reservation but found it unnecessary since the restaurant pretty empty.  Even though it was my birthday dinner (one of many), I didn't have anything to drink since I had to drive. Instead I tried out one of their non-alcoholic drinks, Green Tea Mojito which was very minty and quite refreshing for $7  When we were about to order our dishes, I was so disappointed to hear that the 'Kyukyoku' was unavail for the day! So disappointed that I screamed a little and I am pretty sure I made our server feel a little uncomfortable...only for a tad second though. Feeling crushed (yes, I take my food very seriously), I decided to order other things to make up for it.   Ordered: Sashimi Platter 4/5  * Fresh sashimi pieces for the day, choose $50 or $100 * We added lobster for extra $15 * All of the sashimi pieces were laid out beautifully on a wide stone plate * Memorable pieces were salmon (they were super creamy) and lobster sashimi (very fresh and bouncy meat) * They took the lobster claw and made miso soup with it  Ordered: JaBistroll 4/4  * Salmon, snow crab, uni and tobiko for $22 * This roll was recommended by many and it did live up to the expectation * It is pricey for what it is but the roll literally melts in your mouth * Using real snow crab does really make the difference  Ordered: Aburi 5/5  * Blowtorched 7 pieces for $27 * These are nigiri pieces with that extra added 'condiments' and blowtorched on top * Ours came with 4 aburi nigiri sushi and 3 pressed sushi pieces * They were all very good but I say the best piece had to be saba (mackerel) * Sweet shrimp head came deep fried (perfect with beer)  Summary: Aside from the fact that Kyukyoku was unavail for the night, my dining experience at JaBistro was close to perfect. Our server Jonathan was very helpful and kind, and the food was just what I expected. Sure, it is def on the pricey side- but you get what you paid for and it is quality Japanese food. I will def be back, when I have the extra money to spend that is."}
{"text":"Ja Bistro was absolutely fantastic. My fianc√©e and I went there to celebrate our 6-year anniversary as we both love sushi and wanted to taste something higher end than the cheap AYCE sushi that is widely available in Toronto.  Service The staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, all fluent in English and most in Japanese. They made sure to check on you every so often (non-intrusively) to make sure that you were satisfied with your meal and to top you off on drinks.  Ambience The restaurant is small, but nicely decorated with low light and modern furnishings. We sat at the sushi bar as we wanted to watch the sushi chef work his magic! The music playing was contemporary and fairly upbeat, but interestingly enough, traditional Japanese opera was playing in the bathroom.  Food We both had the sushi nigiri taster and tried the pear sake which was delicious. The chef gave us a wide variety of fish including the much sought after Toro (fatty tuna), Unagi (Eel), Scallop (topped with roe and our favourite!), and others. The fish and rice were well prepared and it added to the delicious experience!  Price The menu is quite costly (we payed ~$80 each), but that is very much expected for the quality of sushi that you are getting, especially in Toronto where we do not have ready access to good fish.  We highly recommend anyone going here so long as you enjoy sushi, although if you don't, there are cooked options (but in that case, why are you dining at a sushi restaurant!) We were highly impressed with the entire experience and plan to return soon to have the sashimi platter (bigger, thicker cuts of that delicious fish? Yes please!)"}
{"text":"Had an awesome meal here earlier tonight. Loved everything we order. Sushi was so fresh and presented beautifully. My husband and I shared the sushi kyukyoku (ultimate fresh pieces), sashimi sampler, pressed salmon sushi roll, snack of the day and the duck breast salad. Everything was delicious! Loved it! Prices are reasonable for what you get. Service was really good as well. Great place to go for a nice dinner out - casual yet special... I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"One word: aburi. Oh my gosh, I've died and gone to sushi heaven. Recommend wagyu and salmon oshizushi. Service was top notch - attentive and the typical Japanese over-politeness."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at the food here first time around. I find the food unique and really like their JaBistroll since you get to try pretty much everything. I would just order a few of those instead of the other combinations. The sushi are torched and give you the slightly charred taste. The flavour is superb. You can find yourself analyzing through the different layers of taste from the bite.   It's a nice little venue with modern decor. The price is on the high side but the food is worth the price in my opinion. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for the first time and absolutely loved it! Although I am not a fan of raw fish, I really liked their non-raw fish items. They have a fairly small selection of items of their menu. I feel, they really emphasize quality in their food. My friend tried the sushi and she def'n agreed that this was hands-down the best sushi place in Toronto!  They also have amazing drinks! Tried their green tea mojito - really creative! Light and refreshing!   The decor is also done really elegantly. Simple, yet elegant. Overall, really good experience!"}
{"text":"I think I found my new To Go sushi spot. I am so happy my boyfriend convinced me to go out that evening for some yummy sushi. We didn't make any reservations since it was a spontaneous 5:30pm dinner. We walked in and was surprised they had a patio. We headed up stairs and the patio was just so beautiful. It was clean and classy. A perfect place to have a semi-romantic date. We had the cold green-tea infused edamame, two piece toro sashimi, nama, and the famous aburicious blowtourch sushi and tori nanban. To accompany our meal, i got a moonstone sake and boyfriend got his favourite Sapporo.  green-tea infused edamame: What a great way to start off the meal with some yummy edamame, it was infused with green tea. If you're a fan of green tea, you will absolutely love this.   toro sashimi: it was butter. it was a life changing experience. If i was rich, i would have had a platter of just toro.   nama: which is chef's classic 7 piece of nigiri. I cannot recall exactly what I had but I can tell you that everything was just so fresh. from simple things like shrimp to the most delicate cured mackerel.   aburicious: a perfect dish for two. this was a little platter of their blowtorched sushi. great for first timers who wants to try a little bit of everything.   tori nanban: this was battered chicken with tartar sauce. at this point of the meal we were starting to get full. this was delicious. the chicken was cooked perfectly, still juicy and succulent. The tartar sauce was outstanding.   All in all, the service was great. they were understand and willing to help. They knew the menu inside out. I had a great experience and i will be back very soon. Thank you so much for the great food and delicious sake.   Happy Belly!"}
{"text":"We started with the lobster platter, to our pleasant surprise, it also came with the lobster bisque miso soup, which is very tasty. The presentation of the platter was beautiful and the sashimi is very fresh. However the sushi stole the show! We order the seared salmon and seared shrimp sushi, they were both great! The fat on the salmon was rendered down perfectly, and the seasoning was prefect! We loved it!"}
{"text":"Probably the freshest sushi/sashimi I've had from the downtown area. This place is definitely worth the price tag. Great service and ambiance. The miso soup was spectacular. The lobster sashimi platter was the perfect amount for our party of three. Can't wait to come back here!"}
{"text":"Food: 10/10 Atmosphere: 8/10  Service: 9/10 Overall experience: 9.5/10  Yelp's got it right. Though the decor may not be anything spectacular, it really doesn't matter at a place where the food is THIS good.   The servers are really helpful in the menu selection process; they're your cheery, upbeat type and create a great vibe.  The food is absolutely outstanding with the aburi (blowtorched sushi) the shining star.   THE BOTTOM LINE: a must-try sushi joint in Toronto - amazing blowtorched sushi!"}
{"text":"Food is absolutely outstanding. The price is the problem. I know you have to pay for good sushi but this is a little out of control. That said, if you have the means to pay for it, you won't be disappointed. It's by FAR the best sushi joint in all of GTA."}
{"text":"I'd preferably want to give them 3 1/2 stars. This used to be one of my favorite places with their sushi platters. Over the years, new Japanese restaurants have popped up that are more innovative. Jabistro is still yummy but their core menu hasn't changed at all.   First off, my fav is their lobster sashimi platter. It's not stated on the menu but it comes with lobster miso soup either for 2 or for 4, depending on the size of the platter. The variety of sashimi differs depending on what they have that day. My most recent experience had toro and chu toro. yum  The agadeshi scallop was disappointing. Wish they had the sauce on the side instead of already served.scallops were soft and soggy too quickly.  Also ordered the aburicious. I recommend this for all first time goers to try out their four types of torched sushi."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for 7:30PM on a Tuesday night, I walked in at 7:20PM with my partner as we were off work early and decided to head in first. We get greeted by the hostess, nice lady, acknowledges our reservation and takes us to our table. (Interesting I thought to myself, she did not ask if we wanted to check our coats or bags as they did the first time, Meh i said, it wasn't a big deal)   We sat down, looked at the menu and contemplated what to eat. 10 minutes passed, and after receiving a phone call from my parents that they were going to be late, we decided to indulge in a drink, however not a glass of water in sight. So we waived down our server, and as he came by, he dropped 2 glasses of water.   We ordered a 10oz Sake he had recommended, even had a little taste test before we ordered it, not bad. The restasurant was getting busy, so we decided to order incase we had to wait, and most importantly we were really hungry.   Finally my parents arrived, 7:40PM now, they are brought in and seated at the table, my dad sits down, however, the hostess asks if my mother would like her coat checked, absolutely she says, then goes on and asks my dad if he would like his coat checked, walks by my Partners Coat, remember its a coat, not a sweater, shrug, nor a little skimpy cardigan, a full size coat; does not check it. (fine, as it wasn't a big deal)  My parents sit down and we talk about their day, 10 minutes passed, no water in sight, we sit there sipping on our sake, with 2 glasses of water for 4 people. I look at our server who walks by, he looks, smiles and nods, OK.  5 minutes later, still no glass of water, so I decided to waive him down and ask for 2 glasses of water.  First two dishes arrives (complimentary Lobster miso soup) which comes with the Lobster sashimi platter we ordered along with the IKA we ordered. Soup was ok as it was free, my partner had a tough time taking out the meat, I told her, mostly because the lobster is over cooked, no kidding, it was so overcooked it tasted like rubber; good thing we didn't pay $5 for it or I would've shot myself in the foot.   Immediately after the soup, they change our plates, cleared the table and brought our third dish, (4 pieces of O-toro sushi). Without a doubt, O-toro was amazing, melts in your mouth. After the O-toro is when the waiting game began.   By now it was 8:15PM, we had finished our first 3 dishes and I had drank my cup of water. 8:30PM, my glass is still empty along with my partners. 8:40PM, (after almost 30 minutes) finally someone comes by and fills our water glass ( I didn't say anything as I still had sake but FAAK..) and brings out our lobster sashimi platter. I must say for the price, and it being a \"large platter\", I have definitely seen better. Regardless, the sushi was pretty fresh and it wasn't bad. Downfall; we found a piece of fish scale on one of the sashimi.   We finish the sashimi platter, expecting our last 2 dishes to come out at the same time as they were Nigiri and a Roll (Jabistroll), but nope, they refuse to bring it out.   9:15PM, finally the Jabistroll comes out..without the Nigiri. Fine, Jabistroll is suppose to be their signature, but fk..the roll was soggy, the rice was soggy, when you pick it up with your chopsticks, half the roll crumbles and falls on the table before it makes it to the plate. There was more rice on the plate itself than in your mouth. You put the roll in your mouth, you taste the sear and then everything turns mushy like baby food. FML! I waited how long for this? and it was suppose to be bomb?  After the Jabistroll I figured they would smarten up and bring me the Nama (classic 7 piece nigiri) but again, nope, didn't bring it out. 9:45PM finally they bring out the Nigiri our server says thank you for your patience, by that time I had already zoned out, Inside, i was so frustrated, nothing wouldn't recovered my dining experience unless a miracle occurred.   I decide to order dessert due to the occasion  10PM The dessert comes, I was hoping it would be something fancy, you know like a plate with crazy design of coulis with aerated chocolate or something. BAM, nothing, just 2 stemless martini glasses, 1 of the vanilla ice cream with asian pear, the other of some sort of coconut Sake with strawberries, and a plate which said HAPPY BIRTHDAY, with a scoop of green tea ice cream and a green tea creme br√ªl√©e. No candle, no nothing, just a plate that says happy birthday, like something you would get at loblaws when you ask the lady to write happy birthday on a chocolate card and she gives you all sorts of excuses how she can't do it, or you have to write it on a piece of paper so she can do it. Best part is, after all this waiting, I ask for the bill and NOTHING is taken off, not even the dessert, nor the Nama which took an ice age to arrive.   So what do I do? i took the bill and threw it on the floor and said THIS IS BS! (jus kidding), I paid the bill+15% tip walked out and told myself to never come bak"}
{"text":"What an amazing experience. The incredibly fresh sushi and unique Japanese dishes will leave you craving more. The 'ebi' was mind blowing. A torch blown tiger shrimp sushi that was so delicious i'm craving more as I write. Other favs were the 'buta' pork loin and the 'kani' soft shell crab. My only gripe would be with our slightly inattentive server, but they made up for it with comp drinks. Overall, a must try for any sushi lover."}
{"text":"I came to Ja Bistro to celebrate a birthday and so I reserved a table for their $77/person prixe fix menu.   From the start, service was impeccable. The hostess took my coat and gave me plenty of time to scour the drinks menu as I wait for two more guests. They were packed on a Monday night and weren't annoyed at all that my guests were 30 minutes late.  Drinks are slightly overpriced - I ordered the JaBistro Slipper and it came in a tiny cup for $11. I think next time I would go for Japanese wine instead of cocktails..  The sashimi is very fresh at Ja Bistro and all the dishes were plated exquisitely. The lobster soup 'looked' like it was going to be really salty, but was surprisingly sweet and savory instead. My favorite thing in this prixe-fixed menu was the Ja Bistro roll - it is the epitome of DELICIOUSNESS - a must-try!   Our server was wonderful - she constantly came by to fill up our water glasses and explained in detail what every dish consisted of. She also gave us enough time to actually taste the dish before coming back to check on how we liked it. Service here is top-notch.   The washroom is for one person, but very clean - even the sink was dry! They offer Q-Tips, mouthwash with tiny cups & even women's menstrual accessories!   The sashimi platters that other tables were ordering looked AMAZING - I will definitely be back to try that out."}
{"text":"Mmmm fish. The hostess got about a third of my name correct but the waiter was great and really funny. The sake was delicious and the food was good. There was lobster in the miso soup, never had that before! Blowtorched sushi was novel for us too, really cool. Too bad they kicked us -and all the other clients- out persistently at 11 on a weekend evening because they wanted to close and go home to sleep I guess..."}
{"text":"Hands-down my favourite sushi place in Toronto! Definitely the most authentic and freshest sushi I've tasted in the city. The one that comes closest to Tokyo (yes, I've been lucky enough to experience sushi in Japan).   JaBistro is THE place in Toronto for sushi. Now it's not cheap - but then again, top quality sushi comes at a price. But to me, it's worth it. It's an indulgence.  The sashimi, nigiri, and their Aburi are all top notch. I haven't really had makis here - but then again, this isn't the place for rolls.   If you're looking for sushi quality and authenticity above all, JaBistro is the place."}
{"text":"Never go to JaBistro again. This is what I ordered tonight and I usually don't like raw stuff so I specifically asked waitress to recommend any cooked food for me. They told me the sushi is well-done. However, I suffered my first Food Poisoning experience after eating. 30 mins finishing this meal, I started to get a big headache and a little dizzy while walking outside. Later, I went back home and suffered serious diarrhea and vomited 4 times throughout the night."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS RESTAURANT TO DEATH!! Sure it might just empty out my wallet for the week, but it is worth every single penny!!   I would highly recommend the lobster miso soup, aburi, JaBistroll, nama classic nigiri. The sushi are melt-in-my-mouth-I-could-go-to-heaven divine. While the cooked dishes are also of high quality, I find them in general overpriced for the portion and taste. I don't think they are anything to rave about. Service is extremely attentive.   I would highly recommend this place, just make sure to make reservations beforehand."}
{"text":"I have eaten at an omakase restaurant in the past and thought to myself that I could never eat sushi the same way again, until I found JaBistro. It is a bit on the pricey side, but the quality and freshness of the fish makes dining here worth it. I highly recommend the Kyukyoku, chef's choice of 11 piece of sushi!"}
{"text":"I would give it 3.5 stars if I could...  Before I begin my review, I have to say I'm a big fan of Zen. Fresh fish with personal service.  I use Zen as the bar which no Japanese restaurant in the city has met up to yet.  But, that doesn't mean I stop exploring.  After all the recent hype about this new establishment, I had to give it a try.    When I walked into the restaurant, two thoughts came to mind.  The decor is really nice, and the location is central.  This means that part of the price you are paying for your sushi will go towards the beautiful wood paneling and prime real estate, as opposed to fresh fish.  (That's why I never complain about Zen's ghetto location).    So i sat down and looked at the sparse menu looking for the lobster sashimi and the fish foie gras.  The former I was told was an add on to the $50 platter (but i was not told how much, nor was I told a bowl of lobster miso soup was included).  In fact, not much was explained to me and my dining partner and we were left to choose based on Yelp and newspaper reviews.   We ordered the platter with the lobster addition and the Aburi (torched sushi).  The former was good, but not great.  We sat at the bar and watched with disappointment as the chef assembled platter after platter with pre-cut sashimi.  I know that things would get busier throughout the night, but I've never seen a sashimi chef resort to pre-cut meat.  That alone was a disappointment.  And, I don't believe the fish was served at the right temperature.  Some of the tuna looked beautifully marbled, but didn't melt in my mouth, which I attribute to it being pre-cut and stored too cold.  The lobster was good, but I've had sweeter lobster sashimi.  I never got to see if my lobster was live.  I was really disappointed with the lack of behind-the-bar presence and story.  Waiters mumbled over the various cuts of sashimi, which was not inspiring, and I had to strain to hear what was being said.  Perhaps this is the new urban hipster Japanese experience, but I didn't buy into it.  Don't get me wrong, this sashimi is still much better than that which is served at the many Korean and Chinese owned Japanese restaurants that now litter Toronto.  However, I rate the experience base on expectations from a Japanese sushi establishment, and the price point.  My favourite bite from this platter came from the side of transparent delicately deep fried fish skin.    Now onto the highlight of the evening - the torched sushi.  Every bite was filled with distinct wonderfully inspired flavours.  I also thoroughly enjoyed the adorning tamago and deep-fried shrimp head.  Now that's a dish I would come back for.  There were definitely some \"wow\" factor bites.  We also got an interesting hot cocktail made of orange, cinnamon, green tea and plum wine (I think those were the ingredients).  It was a surprisingly lovely flavour.  And finally dessert ended on a high note.  The dessert of the day was a Banana Mille-Feuille with salted caramel sauce.  We also got the Matcha Puff filled with sesame custard paired with Green-Tea ice cream.  Both were rich in different flavours.  In conclusion - when I want simple fresh sashimi with the traditional Japanese bar service where fish is freshly cut and the sushi chef stops to chat and explain things, I will still go to Zen.  BUT, if I want some interesting sushi flavours and innovative desserts, I will go to JaBistro.  Hope they can sustain such a prime location!"}
{"text":"I have been two JaBistro twice now. Both times, my experiences were great; however, I would suggest avoiding the set menu and order a la carte items instead.  I highly reccomend the following: - ebi oshizushi  - salmon oshizushi  - JaBistroll  - sashimi sampler  - kyukyoku  The only items that I was not fond of were the pressed mackrel roll and the lobster miso.  Overall, JaBistro is still my favorite sushi restaurant in the city in terms of taste, followed closely by Miku and Yasu. Having said that, JaBistro is a bit loud - which does not bother me - but if you're looking for a more quiet and authentic omakase experience, then Yasu is still the better option."}
{"text":"Amazing Japanese restaurant! Best sashimi and sushi I have ever had in my life! Best service and beautiful environment.  I strongly recommend this restaurant for people that value real sushi! Xoxo"}
{"text":"Loved JaBistro. Such an elegant, modern, and fun place to dine. They have a great menu, and their sampler dishes especially let you try out quite a large range of items. Their fish is fresh and you can see the chefs preparing a lot of the food behind the counter for you. It was pretty cool to see them blowtorching the fish and then serving it right away to you. I also absolutely loved the pork belly -- very rich, melt in your mouth. They have a large selection of sake drinks as well. We ordered drinks based on recommendations by the waiting staff and were very pleased. In general, the waiting staff here is awesome. They don't hover over your table, but seem to know exactly when you're finished with each dish because they'll come over immediately and take your empty dishes and right away start preparing for your next dish. I would definitely recommend making a reservation here as it can get quite busy!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best sushi places I have been to in a long while. We ordered one of the combo platters that was a perfect variety of the menu. I really don't know what half the items were as I ate them but they all tasted excellent and different from typical sushi restaurants. I only did not give it 5 stars due to the ambiance. But if you are a foodie and want a great meal, this is your place."}
{"text":"A very nice find! The place looked pretty sophisticated, but it also felt cosy. Definitely a nice place to hang out with friends and have some delicious food.  I tried the Aburi and Nama. I didn't think I would enjoy the Aburi because it was blow torched and I generally don't like my fish cooked, but I'll admit it was a very pleasant surprise. It wasn't cooked all the way through, which provided a nice contrast in texture as well as flavour. It was also my first time eating sushi where the sushi was already seasoned (i.e. no need for soy sauace or wasabi). Complements to the chef, they did a really good job making sushi with such a harmonious balance of flavours.  This made me realize how little I know about food, and what more I have to learn. Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Went there early Jan 2013  for my wife's birthday.  We were greeted warmly by the staff and were seated at the bar near Chef Koji's workstation.   Through out the night we were treated with the an assortment of sushi \"kyukyoku\" (ultimate fish pieces).  Koji was interactive and asked what we liked and didn't like prior to serving each piece.  I would go again and recommend you sit at the bar near the front of the house for the best view.  Update: Just got back from Japan and this is very close to fresh as you can get in Toronto.  There are only a select few places that serve Sushi as fresh."}
{"text":"Beautifully designed restaurant with equally well crafted sushi. It feels clean, minimal, and modern. The staff is very friendly and attentive.  I recommend ordering the seared sushi if you want to try something different from your normal sushi. The sampler is also quite extensive and a good deal for $30. All the fish is incredibly fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"For anyone looking for a short version review: Me likes!  Popped in for lunch on a random Wednesday lunch, stepping out of the cold and greeted by distinctly Guu-feel of the room, made fancier by the dimmed lighting, exposed brick walls, and slate accents. It was literally empty in there, save for one other table serving two guests.  After nearly giving myself an aneurysm debating over the sashimi platter or deluxe, kyukyoku sushi, the serving staff kindly recommended the kyukyoku, highlighting the chef's skill in the rice preparation. So glad he made the rec, cause it really was yummy.  The difference between sushi nama and kyukyoku is apparently the number of pieces of sushi served (7 vs ~12 pieces), plus the fish assortment.  Served on a rectangular, flat slate, the rice is more heavily flavoured with vinegar and sweetness than most run-of-the-mill sushi places, really teasing out only the best flavours of the seafood and creating a lovely 'mouth-feel' with the individual grains of rice on the tongue. Hmm, now I'm just sounding like an uppity sushi-b*tch!  Blech. Really and truly though, the sushi comes pre-glazed with sauce and tiniest dollops of wasabi pre-measured inside, so no risk of ruining perfectly yums sushi by accidental soy sauce drownings.  Can't remember everything that was served, but here were the standouts for me: 1. Akami/Regular ol' skinny tuna - Melts in your mouth so goods 2. Toro/Fatty tuna - Aww yiss, even meltier) 3. Mirugai/Geoduck - So fresh and so clean, clean! 4. Lobster - Sweet and 'bouncy'  5. Wagyu/Beef"}
{"text":"I've been thinking on what to write for this place for the last few days, and I have to conclude that it was a decent experience marred by bad service.   The place has a Bay Street look to it, with a dark interior with wood and black interior. The door leading to the washroom is well hidden and has an 'exclusive' look to it.   We were a group of 8 and we decided to check out the $100 sashimi platter before deciding what to order next as we wanted to try the aburi sushi next.   The presentation of the platter was the best that I have seen anywhere. Pieces of mackerel, toro, and lightly grilled toro were placed on a decorative fish head and vegetables.    The toro was quite tender and delicious as was the mackerel. Everything was fresh and well made.   The problem came with the pieces of fried rice that the fish was sitting on. Looking at the picture you would think that they were supposed to be eaten with the fish. My friends bit into it and it was rock hard!  One of our group complained to the waitress and she said 'Oh it's fried'. A few minutes later another also complained again, and she said 'oh it's a decorative piece of rice, you're not supposed to eat it'.  That comment just floored me. If you're going to put a piece of fish on a piece of rice  in a sushi restaurant then you should make an attempt to make it edible, and if it wasn't edible, she should have warned us the first time we told her. The fact that she made no attempt at all to handle our complaint turned us off to staying. We got the bill paying the mandatory 18% tip and left.   Sorry to say but Ja Biatro missed the mark this time."}
{"text":"Love this place! Can't wait to go back! I didn't know what I was getting when I came here but I knew they had great reviews... and the reviews are right. This place is authentic. You're not going to come here and have some kind of strange fusion roll... you're going to have sushi... like real sushi! It's a little hidden and hard to find, but it's right next to Yuk Yuk's. It is a really small place so get reservations well ahead of time.   The items that say \"roll\" are not actually rolls. They look more like the shape of small pastries. But with sushi. OMG they are sooooo good! Melt in your mouth good! We also got the salmon collar... which was amazing! They bring it out whole, and then take it in the back and take it apart for you. If you are like me and like the skin, make sure to ask them to not throw it out. They were going to throw out the skin! But I yelled right before she could! Their sashimi platters are amazing! I wish I was in a bigger group and I could have gotten a bigger one. I don't think they have a full bar... just wine, beer and sake. But no complaints about that from me"}
{"text":"Easy to call in and make reservation.  Sashimi was fresh and I loveeee their desserts. The pressed sushi wasn't up to expectation in both flavour and texture.  Service was very efficient and polite."}
{"text":"Mmmm Ja Bistro! Sure it's a bit pricey but I loved most of the dishes and can't wait to come back and spend all my money lol.   Favourites were sashimi platter - everything so fresh and delicious and beautifully presented.   The salmon pressed sushi is a must.   And shockingly the salad with salmon and crab is amaze balls.   My girlfriends also got the lobster miso soup and rest enjoyed it.   The Ja Bistro roll was decent, and the only thing we didn't like was the fried shrimp. I'm happy to say Ja Bistro lived up to the hype for me and I'd love to return.   Also great decor and ambiance - I hear they have a roof top patio I need to check out!"}
{"text":"WAY over priced bar prices. I bought the same saki in a supermarket for $15 so why charge $70 for the bottle. Limited sushi and butane cooked fish... achk...why is this place so packed?  Slow cooked beef was mostly fat.  But I live in LA so why would I go to a Japanese restaurant in Toronto?  We spent $400, left hungry and bored. Went around the corner to the Fifth Grill and had chicken wings and poutine. When in Rome...."}
{"text":"I've been back since February and have noticed that the food is not as good for the same price as before. Not to say that the food is bad though, it is still pretty amazing, but just pricier than before. The atmosphere is very nice, just wish they had more dessert choices!   February 2013 I've been here 5 times the past two week. Yes... They are that good! I've also recommended them to several friends and all of them have come back to me with positive reviews. I usually go for the $50 sashimi platter + the lobster. Their sashimi is very fresh and the quality is also very good."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a group og people duringTIFF.   The place is small but nicely decorated. From the time we were treated with great service.   Because of the size if the group we all had the tasting menu.   The food was very fresh and of the highest quality. The sushi  and sashimi was extremely fresh and very tasty. Ending dessert was the perfect amount.   Definitely will be back to try something off the menu."}
{"text":"Very fresh and delicious!!! We got the lobster platter but next time, I will ONLY get the Aburicious -- worth a trip back to Toronto!!"}
{"text":"If you're on Instagram, in Toronto, and like sushi you've definitely already heard of or seen JaBistro's great posts on social media. JaBistro is a couple steps below the likes of Yasu, Zen, and Shoushin but that is partially because they offer more than just omakase (or, Kyukyoku at JaBistro), and the price point is more affordable as well. I would put this place on the same tier as Kiu in Markham, both of which are above Miku.   It's a great place to take dates with good mood lighting.   Remember to sit at the sushi counter for best results. While they do have great desserts, an okay drink menu, and nice aburi options, the Kyukyoku is your best bet if you like eating raw stuff. It usually comes with fresh uni, blue fin tuna belly, and high quality items such as wagyu and lobster. To note, what's available is based somewhat on seasonality so you might not always get lobster or whatever, but all the pieces are usually at least solid."}
{"text":"If you're looking for mouth-watering, melting in your mouth sashimi, this is the place for you! Although pricey and on the higher end of restaurants, this place is worth every buck. Came here for my birthday last weekend and we loved it!   The waiter was very patient as it was our first time and we weren't sure what to order. We ended up with favourites that were recommended by our waiter. Started with the hakkaido salad and sashimi platter to share and each got our own kyukyoku and aburi. Note: should've shared the kyukyoku and aburi as well; having our own was way too much food (although we did finish it all). All 4 dishes were amazing! Great presentation and variety. The sashimi melted like butter in our mouths. Did I mention this place was worth every buck?   Our dessert was the creme br√ªl√©e and green tea ice cream. As the biggest creme br√ªl√©e enthusiast, this made it to my top creme brulees in the city! Loved it!   JaBistro does their version for winterlicious and summerlicious twice a year. Where you can get 5 courses for $77. Although we didn't do that this time around, would love to come back and try that. Overall, 5 stars for this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to go here since a lot of my friends have recommended this place or if I'd ask them about it, they get really excited. Definitely set expectations high, but they were met!   There's a really nice vibe and atmosphere going in here. We were seated at the bar which was nice to see the sushi chefs at work. Unfortunately, the bar is really high so I did need to lean over to see which I thought took a little away from the experience.   The service is really attentive and everyone seemed very friendly and approachable.   For drinks, I don't remember the name, but it was non-alcoholic and tasted like the strawberry campino candy. It was so creamy even though it didn't look like it'd be. So delicious!   We decided to get the small sashimi sampler. The fish is really fresh, just how'd you expect.   What really stole the show was the blowtorched sushi. We decided to get the aburicious because it was a sample of all the blowtorched sushi except for the waygu oshizushi, so we ordered a plate of that as well. The shrimp and salmon blowtorched sushi had some amazing concoction on it. I dunno what it was, but we ordered the shrimp one because it was too good! I'm not kidding you, it's like your body shot up to heaven because you died from how amazing it was LOL   I would definitely come back to have more blowtorched sushi and try some cool other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Jabistro is definitely my finale's favourite Japanese restaurant if he wants a set of delicious aburo or pressed sushi. They also have a great premium sashimi set although the price is on the mid - higher side. I personally do recommend going for lunch, its less busy and the amount to be ordered can be under $70 for two people since individual's lunch portion are typically smaller but still able to enjoy the same amount of yumminess : ). Plus, a great lunch is always a good treat during a busy work week!"}
{"text":"I can't think of any complaints. I've been here twice and both times the sashimi was super fresh and delicious. But I have to say.. I love their pressed sushi even more! Service is also super attentive and the atmosphere is always intimate and nice. I did try a cocktail that I didn't 100% like, but that's about it. If I had money to spare (obviously I do not) I would come back again and again!"}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????????????????????  Fish is fresh and tasty. Service and cleanliness are good enough level as same as Japan though, still feel expensive for me."}
{"text":"High expectations but big disappointment. Tuna sashimi was cut so poorly it had some sinewy tendon like part that I had to spit out - isn't removing this sushi chef 101?  Not a single piece of the sashimi sent me into sushi heaven that is possible with the finest stuff, and the sea bream tasted off. The aburi rolls were better but the price points deserved everything to be much higher standard. Definitely not the best in Toronto, not even close."}
{"text":"1. The waitress seems impatient when explaining the drinks 2. The food quality is not good at all!! We ordered the prix fix menu. The first time I see an appetizer has both cooked and raw fish on the same plate! The sashimi is even in chunk! Not in slice! The lobster miso soup, the lobster is not fresh at all! For the sushi, the octopus tastes like rubber. The mango exploration tastes like regular juice.   Won't ever come back again! So disappointed!"}
{"text":"Started off at the bar while we waited for our table to be ready.  Ordered an old fashion (not on the menu) which was ok but definitely didn't stand up against other old fashions in the city. The spicy celery lime cocktail was very different from anything I ever had before.  Not spicy and very celery tasting.  Wish there was less celery bitters and more ginger syrup.   The place is small and the decor is underwhelming. But the lack of interior design is made up for in food.   I suggest getting stuff from the blowtorch section of the menu - get it all in fact!  So tasty. The jabistroll just melts in your mouth however it was a tad overkill with the roe. The uni spaghetti was creamy deliciousness. All the food went very well with the millionaire's dream sake - light crispy refreshing sake which can be served cold warm or hot.   Was intrigued by the Kama so ordered it. The menu warns you that it takes 25 minutes (actually took much longer) and the quantities are limited. It's literally the head of the fish up to the neck served with a slice of lemon shaved daicon and light soy sauce. Interesting but not worth the wait and not a lot of meat.   The Japanese lemon tart wasn't anything to write about. The pumpkin creme brulee was nice - not too sweet and not too pumpkiny.   I would definitely come back to eat here."}
{"text":"I came to jabistro because it's one of the highest rated most talked about SUSHI restos in Toronto.   I've never had \"nice\" sushi in the city before so this would be a first. We got a sashimi plate 9 pieces and a few of their special rolls - aburusicios and a pressed salmon roll.   Both were very tasty - a cute lil spicy pepper on top. Fish was very fatty and delicious. However forking over 20$+ for 8 pieces of sushi made me miss the days when I could get AYCE for the same price back in '08.   I think it's hard to find very good sushi in Toronto which has ruined the art to AYCE, and just mediocre salmon rolls. I'll come back if I get engaged or if I'm a rich banker one day and can afford their 300$ seafood bucket."}
{"text":"Veeery pricey but also quite good. We had the torched sushi and the jabistroll and they were pretty good. I'm going to try the sashimi sampler next time."}
{"text":"The food is so good. Sometimes when exams suck all joy from me and I think life is meaningless I remember that at least I can still come here for the bomb food."}
{"text":"Ja Bistro... Can't say enough about this restaurant. It's truly the best sushi joint in town. Servers are friendly, the crowd is classy, the ambience is great, and the sushi as fresh as ever. Their aburi (blow torched sushi) will keep you coming back for more."}
{"text":"The o-toro was great.  Jabistro is always my go to for sushi. Their blowtorched sushi was a bit greasy this time. But overall I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"The sashimi here is very fresh and high quality, but what surprised me was the sushi. The sushi is so flavorful and unique. You would not see the same sushi anywhere else. I did not really care for the lobster sashimi though. I don't think it's worth the extra 30 dollars. I wish I had ordered more sushi with that 30 dollars lol"}
{"text":"I came here (for my birthday) based on the raving reviews but I am quite disappointed. My boyfriend and I ordered the Hokkaido salad, agedashi scallop, JaBistro Roll, kyukyoku sushi set and 100$ premium sashimi selection. I enjoyed the agedashi scallop and Hokkaido salad which is the only reason I am giving this place a 2 star instead of 1 star but everything else was poorly presented and tasted quite the same.   The premium sashimi included a selection of very tiny pieces of sashimi that definitely was not $100 worth... Salmon, hamachi, kampachi, seabream, spot prawn, wagyu.. Served on a wooden looking chopping board, decorated with old and dry cucumbers and two pieces of carrots. I was completely astonished by how poorly presented a ONE HUNDRED DOLLAR plate could be. It looked as though the food was placed in a salad tossed than poured onto a meat cutting board. The value of this platter is no more than $25.  The kyukyoku sushi had 10 pieces of nigiri, the fish was old especially the sayori. The smell and taste was covered with over saucing and super sweet sushi rice.   The signature Jabistro roll tasted mediocre, typical fusion style maki. Also the rice didn't hold, kept falling apart. Not impressed.   The service was average, our server.. I'm not sure her name but she looked Canadian? Perhaps European? .. Forgot to punch in our sushi order and before we could finish our meal, she kept pushing the dessert menu towards us. Poor food, poor service with an overly priced bill of $240.  I will not be coming back to this place. There are much nicer Japanese restaurants within walking distance."}
{"text":"Don't do takeout.  What kind of high end sushi is this.  Not everyone has time to wait for a dine in.  Poor consumer service."}
{"text":"I'm so glad it is just downstairs. I can go there anytime. Sushi is as good as always. Love that lychee drink"}
{"text":"This place is beyond amazing. The quality of the food was fantastic. The portions may look small but don't let that deceive you, it is very filling!!!  The restaurant is pretty small and narrow. Not much elbow room or privacy between parties. The set up of the restaurant is nice and clean. The washrooms are private and super clean as well.   The service was great. Always on top of everything. Never had to ask for a refill or had to wait for plates to be cleared. They were very kind and accommodating.   Food: 10/10 Atmosphere: 8/10 Service: 10/10  Came for lunch on a Friday without any reservations and didn't have to wait for a table."}
{"text":"Many of our friends love JaBistro so we decided to try it for our anniversary. We wanted the Jabistroll and regular sashimi platter but since I love green tea, we decided to try the green tea infused edamame as well. Gotta get your veggies somehow right?   When the edamame came, let's just say our definition of \"infused\" seemed to be very different from the restaurant's definition lol...there was a stockpile of green tea leaves IN the dish. At first, we tried to pick out the leaves but halfway through the meal, we just gave up and ate whatever tea leaves were on the edamame as well. More veggies!    Aside from that, the roll and sashimi were great"}
{"text":"Updating my review to 3.5 stars (from 5) given JaBistro's relative ranking vs. new Sushi entrants in the local area (based on Price, overall experience and quality offerings).   Still great sushi & sashimi in Toronto but I find the non-sushi / sashimi items not as good. Also getting harder to justify JaBistro's higher prices relative to the new \"Yasu\" restaurant in Toronto.   BK"}
{"text":"Jabistro is near my home, so it becomes my favorite sushi place. The price will become high if order the lobster platter, but the loster sashimi is really really fresh and tasty! The aburi style sushi is the best in town. I have recently visited Miku, another aburi style sushi restaurant and it was not that good as Jabistro. Also, Jabistro has my faviourite drink , Mio, a must try sparkling sake!"}
{"text":"The service is excellent: friendly greetings and lots of attention. They have a coat check, which is great because the seating is unsuitable for hanging coats off your chair (backs are too low and coats will drag on the floor).   I went there for lunch on a weekday and there was only one other table being occupied so there were a lot of servers with nothing to do. Best time to go!  The food was WAY more expensive than I was expecting. I've never been to a place that charges so much for sushi. But the food was excellent and very artfully arranged. From the description on the menu, I thought that the 'Fish Bowl' was going to be like Sashimi Don, but it was actually sashimi on a plate and a separate bowl of rice topped with raw hashed tuna (forget the name for it). It was delicious, but I will not be going back there. My pockets aren't that deep and there are less fancy, over-the-top places in Toronto where I can go for quality sushi."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place because I am so sick and tired of terrible japanese food in the city (the all you can eat types). I tried a variety of dishes including: sashimi, torched sushi, the pork and the cod + dessert.  Everything was delicious and the fish was so fresh and expertly cut and presented.  Sadly it did not live up to my favourite japanese restaurant in the city (sushi kaji) which I hold up as the epitome of authentic and mind blowingly amazing japanese food.  Jabistro though, is modern and located downtown and I'm glad to have experienced it. I will be going back!"}
{"text":"Making a reservation was easy as it can be done right from their website. On the day of the reservation I got a call from the JaBistro confirming my reservation and in addition they asked me whether I wanted to sit at the Sushi bar or at a table. I decided to go with the table as I wanted to converse with my guests. I arrived a bit early, the exterior is kind of nondescript and I wonder what was at this location before as I am sure I have passed by it many times. Since my guests were not here I decided to sit at the bar which is separate from the main dinning area. I ordered a Sapparo draft and chatted with the bar tender a bit about their Sake list , the bar tender had his hands full with making all the drinks but was informative.  The interior is modern and has a very clean straight finish. When my guests arrived we were seated immediately.  I kind of knew what I was going to order so waited for my guests to decide.  We ordered a whole bunch of items some were cooked and some were from the Sushi/Sashimi. They were apparently out of some ingredients and we could only get one of the roll we wanted. Sashimi Platter. Beautiful presentation and icing on the cake was they had real wasabi grated on the side. Very fresh, one of the better sashimi platters I have had.  It even had some prized items like geoduck sliced paper thin, just right IMO.  JaBistroll: this one hit it out of the park. The uni was very creamy and balanced out the delicate tastes here. I am not a big fan of rolls but this one was good enough for me to convert. I wish they had enough ingredients so we could get two of these.  Aburri: 7 Pieces of Sushi finished with blow torch. The trend for aburri is on the rise though it can be hit or miss, IMO the white fish benefit from this style of sushi. Decent but not spectacular.  Nama: We ordered two of these and they didn't disappoint. 7 Pieces of excellent sushi. Nice rice to fish ratio. High marks here. There was a hand roll that was also good and not overloaded with rice. Deep fried shrimp heads provided a nice contract to the sushi items.  Now for the cooked items this is where the experience started to falter. Tori nanban: battered chicken that was served with tartar sauce! and covered with salad with miso dressing. The meat was soggy and devoid of the crispness one seeks. Thankfully they used dark meat but it still didn't save this dish. Disaster IMO. Kani: Deep fried softshell crab. Nothing special here again. Below average IMO. Not crisp/crunch one craves.  Gindarra: I didn't try this dish. Though it was well liked by fellow diners.  The Sushi and Sashimi is very good even at the higher price point they have here. I would say 4 stars for that. The cooked items need an overhaul or if you can live without ordering cooked stuff I would advise you refrain from ordering those. 2 Stars for the cooked items.  A tricky rating here for me as it is a 4 star sushi/sashimi experience. 3 Stars overall due to the sub par cooked items."}
{"text":"Very very delicious sushi here. Probably one of the best I ever had in Toronto in terms of price and selection available. For about $100-150 you can get a great selection of very fresh sushi and sashimi including sometimes bluefin tuna. Would highly recommend to anyone in downtown that want's awesome sushi."}
{"text":"OMG best sushi I've had in Toronto.   Don't come to JaBistro for the ambience, come for the food. Fresh sashimi, blowtorched nigiri, specialty fish and an impressive sake list made my night here one to remember.  Everything was delicious!  We had: Blow torched wagu beef sushi - 5/5 sashimi sampler - fresh and tasty and reasonably priced. $30 for around 12 pieces sea bream collar - 5/5 black cod 5/5  We had the third sake on the list. it was $35 for a 10 oz. We had it warm. It was very smooth.  If you're into sushi, JaBistro is the place to go. If you're looking for sushi pizza and specialty maki with cream cheese in it, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Very good and fresh, good atmosphere. Would definitely come back. Only downside was this place is pretty spendy. However the quality of the fish was outstanding."}
{"text":"Best place for sushi in the city. The quality was outstanding. I recommend sitting at the sushi bar to watch how meticulous they are building each dish.   The Sake selection is pretty good. I wish the locations was larger. Sometime you can feel a little cramped in there by the service and food is excellent.   If your lucky....you'll get to see a massive sushi boat put together. Ideal for larger parties.   It's conveniently located beside a comedy club so its a great plan for a date."}
{"text":"I prefer Mike than here. Although I could see its popularity - we came at the earliest time on an extremely freezing weather but it soon got packed in half an hour, they however put too much oil on the sushi, made them too greasy. Too much rice too."}
{"text":"Came here a week ago on a Saturday night after Toronto's Comicon. I've always wanted to try this place but I don't frequent downtown restaurants too much. Finally I got to try tonight! No reservations, but walked into the bar with no wait. Lucky us!  Ordered the $50 sashimi platter to share with a friend. The size was rather small. Felt like it was a one person set. I think we should have ordered the $100 one. Regardless of the size, the quality was excellent. The tuna (akami, or maguro if you want) was of a much higher quality than other restaurants (I suspect it was from a bluefin tuna, but I could be wrong. I didn't ask).  I ordered the aburi sushi ($27). Quality was also excellent, but it felt like I didn't get the amount of \"blowtorchness\" that I wanted. I would have preferred a little bit more torched.  My friend ordered the lobster miso soup. He said it was a bit salty, and he didn't get the giant claw that I keep seeing in other pictures. Too bad..  One of my other friend ordered the Jabistroll and the salmon oshizushi. I tried a piece of the jabistroll, and it was really good.  My friend and I also ordered 2 pieces of otoro at $13 each. Quite pricey, but also very good.. melts-in-your-mouth fattiness. The quality was on par with the one I had at Yasu, but Yasu sold it at only $10 a piece (lol \"only\").  As for the service.. When I ordered the otoro, the lady was attentive and had a great smile. The speed at which the food came out was, however, quite slow. My other friend who ordered the jabistroll and salmon oshizushi took 45 minutes to come.  The green tea ($4) wasn't all the great...  To conclude.. great quality sushi and sashimi, if you've got the money to spend. Definitely need to come back to judge again.  9.25/10 for the quality (9.5 for the Toro and Sashimi plate, 9.0 for the rest of the rolls) 8/10 for the service (had to deduct some points for slow service) 8/10 for the value. 8.75/10 overall (not an average)."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Ja Bistro for a while now and now have come here on two separate occasions - lunch and dinner.  The menus are essentially the same, with the dinner adding 2-3 more items and fresh fish selection which is on the over-priced side ($9 for a single boston sourced uni sushi)... but you're paying for quality.  On the bistro menu, the must haves are the ika (calamari) and ebi nanban (shrimp).  The ika is admittedly, probably the best calamari I have had.. and everyone has had a lot of calamari.  The menu shines on the blowtorched sushi portion.  Every single roll is solid, but the standouts are the salmon and jabistrol (that also has uni in it).  The jabistrol is probably my favourite and almost melts in your mouth.  Best sushi in Toronto? possibly.  For dessert they had an interesting creme brulee+green tea ice cream that was different.  They also have a very, very extensive sake list - ranging from reasonable to super pricey.  It'll will be interesting how this place will hold up against the newer, much larger Vancouver import - Miku.    LATE EDIT:  I ended up trying Miku in Vancouver.  Ja Bistro's Aburi is far better."}
{"text":"This is one of the best sushi restaurant that I've been to in toronto. It is a little on the pricy end, but definitely worth the experience.   We got the sashimi lobster platter which came with the lobster miso soup, and jabistroll. I would recommend getting the jabistroll and other blow torched sushi. There aren't many restaurants that serve lobster sashimi, which is why I went there. It's worth a try if you're into sashimi. They make it right in front of you and the presentation is great. The bill between the two of us was a little over $100, but it really depends on what you end up getting."}
{"text":"Had been here twice. The Salmon oshizushi is very very delicious, a must-try. The JaBostro roll and lobster soup were not so impressive.  Will go back someday again:)"}
{"text":"This place was wonderful. I came here on valentines day and surprisingly it wasn't over crowded. This is definitely one of the high end sushi restaurants in Toronto along with Sushi Kaji which I still have to try.  The decor is modern but holds the essence of Japan. Service was great and attentive. The place was kind of small and a little cramped but the coat check helped. The atmosphere was lively and did feel some what authentic Japanese. It took me a few minutes to find the washroom though because it was flush with the wall and push door. But the washroom was nice, it was one of those with nice paper towels and mouthwash on the side for you to use  All the food I had was great. I have no complains about any of the food I ate that night. Miso soup was light and not overly salty but had a lot of flavour because of the lobster. We shared two appetizers Lobster Carpaccio looked wonderful with exuberant colours and the lobster tasted great with the combination of flavours. The other appetizer was the Kamo Nanban Soba which is pretty much duck with crunchy noodles and this was just as good as the lobster with great overlapping flavours and texture. Duck was cooked perfectly. The main we had the $50 sashimi platter but I added the lobster that was an extra $30 but in hind site unnecessary because we had lobster in the appetizer. But nonetheless I was not disappointed. The platter came with an assortment of seafood that was super fresh and some that you wouldn't get at regular sushi restaurants like sea urchin.   Overall experience was great. Definitely would recommend for someone who is seeking to find the best sushi in Toronto. But it is pricy but you're paying for what you're getting and it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Overall: 3.5 stars Quality of the food : 4 stars. The sashimi is very fresh and well prepared. We order the lobster sashimi combo and my partner loves it very much. However, I gave 3 stars because the selection of the food is very limited. If you are not big fan of raw food, there are not much other options to order from the menu.  Service: Service is great. The server brought a complimentary dessert for us because of the special occasion D√©cor/seating: D√©cor is classic and elegant but seating is very limited. Each table is very close to each other. For the price they charge, I would expect more comfortable seating instead. Price: For two people, total bill is around $180 after tax and tips."}
{"text":"Ever since they opened, jabistro has remained a favourite. I'm extremely picky when it comes to sashimi that I never order it except when I come here. Their sashimi platters are always so beautifully presented and the fish is so fresh that every single piece just melts in your mouth. I'm also a HUGE fan of aburi and their salmon oshizushi is the best! It's packed with flavour and has just the right amount of char. I could eat two plates of this if I didn't love their sashimi so much. The service is also great and the restaurant itself is so beautiful and clean."}
{"text":"I actually thought this place was a little over rated.  I mean the sushi was pretty tasty, but nothing astounding.   But it was relatively more pricey than I would expect.  The biggest downside for me is that there is zero natural lighting in the whole restaurant.  Not a single window.  That being said, the decor was nice."}
{"text":"I didn't have any expectations for this place so I came in with an open mind.   Started my meal with a lobster miso soup. It was decent but there wasn't anything special about it. I think lobster meat shouldn't be used for soup because it can easily be overcooked.   Our meal then came with a sashimi platter. The sashimi was good and fresh and it came with wide variety of fishes that I have never tried before. Some were too fishy for my liking but nevertheless it was good.  Finally the meal ended with a torched sushi plate. It was good but nothing too special.  I can't really pinpoint why I didn't enjoy the sushi as much. Maybe it was because despite all the food I felt hungry or the fact that it didn't taste any more special than other higher end sushi places in the gta.  I would say come to try it once and make your own opinion. It is more pricy than most places and don't expect to be 'full'.   The service was good but it was hard to understand what we were being served due to accents (not their fault) - my bad hearing.   For two people, and the price tag of $200ish - you be the judge ?"}
{"text":"We came here for the second time over the weekend. The quality of sushi here is outstanding! The blowtorched sushi is unique, and it just felt like everything we tried melted in our mouthes. It is at the same level as Sushi Kaje, the difference being that you can get sushi here a la carte and not have to pay a crazy amount for an omakase menu. I would recommend this place to anybody who loves high quality sushi!"}
{"text":"Sashimi platter was delicious! A definite must try if you enjoy sashimi. They offer a lot of different variety of fish. The geo duck was amazing, it reminded me a little of a more rubbery oyster. Sweeter. Presentation fabulous. Fish was high quality and delicious. I really liked their house made soya sauce, as it was a bit sweeter.   Loved the snow crab salad. Light refreshing and delicious also very pretty & delicate. A good way to start the meal.   Aburi sushi was good, but a bit on the oily side for me as the mayo gave it a bit of a greasy texture. This is blow torched sushi chosen by the chef.   Liked that they changed our plates for fresh ones.  We ordered the calamari. This was okay; not my favourite dish. The flavours worked well with the sauce. Tempura was nicely battered, but the sauce made the batter soggy. I would leave the sauce on the side and let customers dip it.   Good service. Slow in the beginning. But better as the evening progressed. For an added touch, they gave us a complimentary dessert to celebrate my boyfriend birthday.  Place is small. Lots if bamboo texture. Cool leather tables. Comfortable booths. Really busy even for a wed night. I'd recommend making a reservation."}
{"text":"House of some of delicious blowtorched sushi. I took aburi and aburicious and they both were fabulous."}
{"text":"One word describes this place: DELICIOUS! Especially their blow torched sushi! If I could I would go there every week. The interior looks nice, the atmosphere is nice and you can watch the chefs preparing your food and on top of that they have a decent selection of sake and other drinks. I hope they maintain the food quality."}
{"text":"You better make reservation. There are not many choices of food but every each dish is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Finally went to Ja Bistro last night! We ordered aburi (blowtorched) sushi and aburicious... my fault! Waitress tried to explain that we were going to be getting similar pieces between the two, but I'm not sure if I was too hungry or something, I wasn't registering what she was saying. I totally would have wanted to try their sushi nama (classic) had it clicked in my head. Oh well, next time. I do want to try the fried oysters, duck soba noodles and wagyu sushi rolls still, so when I feel like another treat-to-myself night, that's where I'll be!  We also ordered the lobster carpaccio (so fresh and loved the citrus flavour), the pork belly (very good, and melt-in-your-mouth), flight of sake to share (our fave was the gunmai ginjo) and we each got a ninjoberry cocktail- so yummy, with fresh strawberries and blueberries! Oh and of course we got two desserts to split- the pear torte and the creme brulee- I can't remember if it was green tea or matcha. The presentation of the dessert was spectacular but taste-wise I was not wowed. And that seems to be the case for many Japanese establishments I have frequented...  Still, I can't wait to go back to try other items on the menu. The service was good overall and the servers were attentive. A great spot to wow an out-of-town guest if you have one visiting our foodie-filled city!"}
{"text":"A bit on the expensive side, but great for special occasions and if you like authentic japanese style sushi and sashimi. Wife took me to this place for my birthday. Nice atmosphere, friendly staff, great food! Best birthday dinner ever!"}
{"text":"JaBistro was recommended to me by several of my friends. I went there on the new year eve and made a reservation online.  We ordered a lobster miso soup and the lobster platter. The soup tastes good but still a little bit way to be amazing. The lobster platter is like a piece of art, very beautiful and eye-catching. I can't remember all the varieties of these fish. All of them are very fish and delicious.   I like the Hokkaido salad which comes with salmon, crab, and ikura(roe).  For the sushi, we ordered Aburi and Jabistroll. Aburi is a very unique kind of sushi. From my understanding, it is a oshizushi with some toppings such as fish or shrimp partially grilled and partially raw. The shrimp aburi is definitely my favorite!  I recommend Aburi instead of Jabistroll.  The ambiance is very good for a date or friend hanging out. The service is good. Hopefully, next the server who introduces the fish would be slow down a little bit and tells more about the fish."}
{"text":"Came here a while back for a celebration dinner so we ordered to our heart's content. In retrospect, everything was fairly good but if I could do it over, I probably would've just ordered 10 pieces of the scallop sushi haha. It was my favourite out of everything and I still salivate a little every time I think back to it. It was so juicy and tender and just a bundle of melt-in-your-mouth-deliciousness!! I would highly recommend it, especially the seared version!  Now onto the other dishes, we ordered: 1) Kyukyoku = chef's choice; pretty darn good! It was an extremely fresh selection of very high quality fish. Great if you're looking to try something new but you may or may not end up with 1-2 fairly distinctive fish that doesn't sit well with your tastebuds.  2) A la carte sushi: lobster, crab, shrimp, and scallop = all four were wonderfully crafted pieces of sushi, again offering great qualities of seafood. The lobster was a bit underwhelming (since it was so expensive), the crab was awesome, the shrimp had an extravagant presentation but was fairly medicore, and THE SCALLOP. Need I not mention how amazing the scallop was.  3) Aburi = similar to the kyukyoku, this was the chef's choice for blowtorched, pressed sushi and was either a hit or miss depending on your tastebuds. I LOVED the scallop, I liked the salmon and shrimp, buuuut I was a little less fond of the mackerel.   If you're looking for a fancy Japanese restaurant where you get your food at a fairly quick rate and there's a variety of menu items for you to choose from, I would recommend here. If you love scallop, I would also recommend here. However, if you're looking for a unique experience where you can just leave everything up to the chef, I would recommend a place that offers a more intimate, customer-oriented omakase such as at Yasu."}
{"text":"Food is very good, the whole environment is good as well. But there is one plate that they forgot to make(grill fish), even after we finished 3 plates of sushi, 2 miso soup, 2 appetizers(which is a very long time). And we asked the waiter about it, the waiter (a white guy) was quite rude. Making this dinner a very bad experience"}
{"text":"Got their beef tartare followed by kyukyoku (12 pieces of sushi) and lastly chocolate ganache for desert. Beef tartare was good, it came with seaweed that you can wrap the beef with. Sushi was served one piece at a time, the fish was very fresh and yummy. Not a big fan of the squid sushi though. Can't chew it at all :( But all other fishes were really good. Service was excellent! Best service ever! I will definitely go back to try their sashimi."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. If you love sushi, eat here. You won't be sorry.   We started off the meal with miso soup, which is made here with lobster broth. The soup has a well-rounded flavor with just the right amount of umami.  We ordered some sushi aburi (blowtorched sushi) which has a lovely subtle smoky flavor to it. I jokes that it smells like the blowtorches are blazing in this restaurant because this is one of their specialties. I especially liked the salmon aburi since it is a fattier fish.. it just melts in your mouth.. sooo good.  Then we took a chance and tried the grilled fish collar, not knowing what to expect. It was a very large portion - best shared among two people. It was exactly what I imagined it would look like. It was very light and flavorful.   Throughout the meal, we were drinking some unfiltered sake. The particular kind that we ordered, the nigori, almost has the consistency of milk. It is very smooth and drinkable.  It was an excellent meal and I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Salmon and tiger shrimp aburi are the best. The jabistroll (i think that's the name of it) is also great. Lovr coming here for their torched sushi. I usually get a drink and my two favourite rolls as appies before heading to another restaurant for another meal."}
{"text":"Food- Well the JaBistroll roll melted in my mouth...  Ambiance- Very modern looking.Looks similar to Kinton Ramen  Service- One word, Amazing.   Value- Shouldn't be worrying about the price if you are eatting here."}
{"text":"Really delicious. I especially like the aburi (blowtorched sushi). I got the abicurious, and this list is in the order of fav to least fav: salmon, tiger shrimp, jabistroll, mackerel. Salmon one is melt in your mouth. Tiger shrimp one has great flavour. I actually didn't like the mackerel one that much and wouldn't order it again. I love how everything is seasoned in its own way, and it def doesn't need any soy sauce or wasabi.   Have also tried the sashimi here which is really good. Nigiri the rice is quite sweet (I'm not a huge fan of nigiri to begin with - I'd rather the rolls or sashimi).  Experienced great service, and really enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"I had the sashimi sampler $30,  jabistroll $22, salmon oshizushi $16,  yukke  $11 (angus beef tartare).  My favorite dish would be the sashimi which is a nice variety of fresh fish. The torched rolls (jabistroll $22/salmon oshizushi$16) were too mushy for my liking.  Its very oily and soft, there isn't much texture, but the flavor is enjoyable.   Yukke is very spicy.  I did not enjoy the flavor.  It's served with a few sheets of seaweed and greens.  Would not order again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday, and both of us were highly impressed with the quality of food JaBistro had to offer. Don't be fooled by the exterior of the restaurant, because the decor inside is quite nice, and the servers are always ready to take your order.  We sat at the bar during our time there, and it was quite fascinating to watch how the chefs prepare our food. We first ordered the sashimi platter, and I was blown away with how fresh they were. Being one who frequents AYCE sushi restaurants, there was a drastic difference between the quality. Definitely worth ordering if you want to experience the amazing sashimi.  We also ordered the aburi (blowtorch) sushi, the Nama classic sushi, as well as the Jabistroll. All in all, they were the best sushi I've ever had, and I would especially recommend the Jabistroll if you're into uni, salmon and snow crab.  Overall, I had a great experience at this restaurant. Those of you who are looking to eat at a quality Japanese restaurant should really consider trying this place out. However, be sure to save up! Their quality food definitely comes with a price (and a high one at that)."}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite sushi place to go in Toronto ! It is to die for . Restaurant itself is pretty small , good to have reservation beforehand, but it's definitely worth a trip . And some nice cocktail too :)"}
{"text":"Their services are amazing, food is consistent.  The sashimi platter has gorgeous plating. Every time I come, it's plated differently. It's always a surprise what fish you get. Take a good 10 seconds to admire the chef's plating, 'eat with your eyes' before touching it with your chopstick.   I am not going to repeat other yelpers about the delicious aburi / aburicious / oshizushi  I've heard that the cooked food are not the best. However, we saw the 'fish collar' on the daily menu. $10 for saba, and $14 for hamachi. And boy was it a winner! Covered in salt and cooked tenderly. If you are not full yet from gorging sushi, and you enjoy steamed (?) fish, this is a good way to end your meal.   And dessert ? It's good but nothing to write home about. You came for the sushi anyway."}
{"text":"I would say most was excellent. Had the sashimi platter which you can tell was amazingly fresh and very high quality. We also tried the sushi samplers and there was a roll with it but the \"torch\" they use to infuse flavours wasn't the greatest. I tasted the burnt flavour more than the fish. I don't really see the value in the firing up some of their items."}
{"text":"When it came to the grilled sea bream, our server went above and beyond by bringing a fork and knife to our table and helping us to physically dissect the sea bream so that it would be easier to eat.  She turned over the head to its back side and helped us to excavate all of the bones out and left all of the succulent fish meat on the plate for us.  Wow, I was so impressed!  What great service!  Thank you so much!:)  The sea bream contained so much meat in its collar that was so fresh and moist.  It went well with a squirt of fresh lemon too.  Since I have eaten fish head as a child, I also dug out the fish cheeks and eye to indulge in.  Sorry if that's too graphic for ya."}
{"text":"Fresh. Supreme. Perfection.  The large lobster sashimi platter was the most delicious and well presented seafood I have ever had the privilege to experience. The lobster miso we had was fantastic with the poached lobster claw we each were given. Then came the main course. It was what I envision perfection to be. Ever piece was as memorable as the last. Finally, we also ordered the aburi, which included seven unique pieces of torched nigiri. Each provided a unique twist on this classic treat.   In addition to that, we were on the summer patio. The wood finish of the patio added a nice touch to the whole ambience and experience. Overall, I would definately recomment this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"First time I was there had the omakase it was fresh and good and expensive. Second time I did a la carte. It was wayyyyyyy better as we had the blow torched sushi which I am a fan of! A lot of different type of sashimi when you order the platter, not the typical type of fish you will get. Make sure you make a reservation though!"}
{"text":"we had: sashimi platter, torched sushi choices and the lobster miso soup. the sashimi platter was delicious but it was really cold because they set it on ice. Also there was no ginger with any of the dishes, just lemon (??). we should have gotten a classic nigiri because the torched options basically all had some fat on top that was caramelized. this made everything taste very good but also very similar."}
{"text":"This was by far the best sushi that I've had. There is something unique about the way they make their rice here. We had the $50 sashimi platter and a couple of other rolls (including the Jabistroll) as well as the lobster miso soup. Everything was melt-in-your-mouth good, particularly the sashimi. I didn't know what half the fish was but every piece was a burst of flavor in my mouth. The Jabistroll is basically a California roll on steroids - definitely a must-order!"}
{"text":"Visited on a Friday night at 7:30pm, reservations for 2 were easily made in advance. Not many restaurants ask in advance if you want to sit at the bar or the dining area. We were promptly seated at the bar to watch the 2 chefs in action, shorter people (5 feet or under) may find it hard to see over the bar. Seats are a bit hard being wooden chairs. It was wonderful to see the use of the blowtorch and the artistry of making sushi throughout dinner. We ordered the 3 course prixe-fixe. The sushi was like butter melting in my mouth! Very flavourful and the presentation was beautiful. Having been to this venue when it was a nightclub (Inside) brought back old memories. When I dropped my chopsticks they had a new pair for me immediately which was impressive. Just the first floor is being used for dining, I remember this place having 3 floors. After the meals I wasn't pleasantly satisfied. This place is now a Favourite restaurant. I am officially naming Jabistro one of the best places for sushi in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Yes it is expensive but totally worth it! I truly enjoy the Ambiance and the food was beautifully presented. As for the Taste just Wow! I totally recommend the Torched Salmon Sushi they are simply melting in your mouth."}
{"text":"It was me and my boyfriend's first time at JaBistro and we were strongly impressed with the food quality and taste. We ordered the sampler sashimi (10pc), salmon oshizushi (6pc), JaBistro roll (8pc), and a grilled amberjack fish collar.  I can't remember exactly what the sashimi included (L-R in picture: sea bream, ?, crab leg, tuna, toro, scallop, ?), but my favourite was the last piece on the right and the toro. The quality was really good and it all kind of just melted in your mouth.   I felt the JaBistro roll wasn't that great and was pretty plain, but the blowtorched salmon sushi was amazing. The grilled amberjack collar was pretty big, had a lot of meat and should definitely be shared with 3+ people.   For my drink, I ordered the Sakura cocktail which is an Asian pear lychee infused drink and was yummy! Would recommend for those who like sweeter drinks."}
{"text":"Had sashimi platter, aburi, JaBistroll and the battered deep fried scallops.  The sashimi platter was delicious.  We got to try a variety of fresh sashimi.  The tuna sashimi just melted in my mouth.  Presentation was crisp and the food looked great.  The aburi was underwhelming.  I probably wouldn't order the aburi again.  It reminded me of a cheap all you can eat dish.  The Jabistroll was on point.  The mix of snow crab, salman and tobiko really hit the spot.  I could have eaten multiple Jabistrolls.  Finally, the scallops.  The scallops came in a small bowl of soup.  I found that the soup added some flavour to the scallops but if you left the scallops in the soup too long the batter on the scallops became soggy.   Overall, the food (besides the aburi) was delicious but was a bit overpriced.  A great date spot as the atmosphere is cozy and the waitress offered great service."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times for lunch during the week and I'm totally obsessed.   I've always ordered the lunch Jabistro platter for $30. Each time it arrives slightly different. Usually comes with a nice salad of fresh greens and a piece of salmon, chicken with a nice sauce, 3-4 pieces of the blowtorches sushi, 2-3 pieces of their Jabistro roll, a cup of the most incredible miso soup I think made from a lobster base and probably more I've forgotten about! The meal ends with a nice plate of dessert. One of my faves was a small piece of cheesecake, vanilla ice cream scoop and cornflakes!   I totally recommend this place and the service is always great."}
{"text":"Great place! My parents and I visited here last week and we had a pleasant evening here.   It's easy to make reservation online, and they called me on the day to confirm the reservation.   Servers were all very friendly. Food was great as well, especially the lobster sashimi a must try!  It's been a long time since i last had lobster sashimi, and I didn't remember raw lobster could taste this good! I would prob give it one more star if the sashimi platter has more varieties...instead of having 3 types of tuna...  For main entree we had the Aburi sushi, which is good. I haven't tried that before and since my mom couldn't eat a lot cold stuff (stomach problem), this was perfect for her.    In general this is a great place and when my bf comes to town I will probably bring him over again."}
{"text":"This restaurant is beautiful and has delicious food. Service was a bit stiff and needed refining, but their food and decor are excellent."}
{"text":"We had a lovely evening with great service. That said we ordered a small lobster platter and aburicious (assorted blowtorched nigiri).    Definitely the quality of fish here is top notch. Very comparable to all the well known sushi places in Toronto. But, the lobster platter and the aburicious were not worth the cost.   Actually, the best bang for buck was everything else they are not known for. The ebi blowtorched roll was definitely the best of all the torched rolls. With JaBistroll  being the most bland flavour. The saba was good, but way too expensive for what it cost. The lobster sashimi was very empty.... In flavour. Don't know what I was expecting.  The best part was their home made soy sauce. Very smokey flavour and goes well with everything. The lobster sashimi absorbed the soy sauce like crazy and made it from bland to good.   Two big tips,  Go for the sashimi platter (without lobster)  Ask for ginger (palette cleanser)  I was surprised there wasn't any by default on the boat/plate.   Overall cost for quality is probably almost the best in Toronto."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the past year now and I think this has to be my favourite sushi place ever. The seafood is so so so fresh and literally melts in your mouth. The sashimi has this nice creaminess to it which is paired beautifully with their house sauce.   Amazing presentation when it comes to plating. Wonderful and attentive service - even coat service. Servers introduce each fish to you and are knowledgable. Their wait staff is so unique in the sense that you can see the discipline in their training - which is pretty common in good Japanese restaurants like Guu.   Highly recommend their sushi platter and aburicious rolls (blow torched and pressed sushi - yum!)  Definitely the best/freshest sushi in the city. Whether you're visiting or from the city, definitely give this place a chance. It'll blow your mind.  PRO TIP: Always make a reservation first! ALWAYS. They get packed really fast."}
{"text":"Poor service.  Last night was the worst sushi experience of my life.    Ordered chefs selection. Salad. Two orders of.o-toro sashimi and blow torched selection.  We got our food very late.  I got my chefs selection. My date never got her blow torch.   My fish was good.  The Waygu did not taste right. Instead of being buttery it tastes chewy and bloody. I spat it out.   More than anything my date say there with no entr√©e.    We kept being told that her food was on the way. It never showed after 1.5 hours.   Then in front of my date the server blamed me for ordering in a way that suggested we would be sharing. Despite the fact that my date ordered hers and pointed it out to her after the waitress forgot the order and came back to tell us she forgot.    I have spent hundreds of dollars here. Doing omakase and various dinners. I will never go back."}
{"text":"The quality here is exceptional but you do need to pay for it. Came here to celebrate a birthday and got the lobster sashimi platter ($130) and aburuchio ($20).  Each piece of sashimi was so fresh and melts in your mouth, I really enjoyed the toro, scallop and lobster sashimi. The presentation was gorgeous and a work of art. The torched sushi was equally delicious as every bite was smooth and buttery, it has a slightly smoky flavor from the torch that goes perfectly together.  Only odd thing was they gave us a plate with Happy birthday written on it but we couldn't really do much with it other than take a picture. it would've been nice if there was a small dessert for your birthday!"}
{"text":"The quality of the dishes were amazing, we had 4 different menu items: Sakura cocktail, large sashimi platter, aburicious and the vanilla ice cream with wine soaked pears desert. They were all unique and delicious and none of the items were a miss! Even though I usually only visit one of these expensive restaurants as a one time novelty, but I will definitely return to this one to try the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Trendy but aspiring to Japanese quality.  Sitting at the sushi bar you can witness the fresh and elegant preparation of the dishes.  This is a costly adventure, but expected when one seeks this level of Japanese fresh quality."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite place to go for seafood. The food is fresh and the ambiance is cozy. Everything on the sashimi platter(50/100) with lobster is extremely fresh, to the point where you can actually taste the freshness. There are two types of soy sauce given to each diner, but you don't even need it, as the fish is just too fresh!  The lobster miso soup is actually amazing, I'm quite sure it has absolutely no msg in it, unlike the soups at other restaurants. The fish on the nama platter is even fresher than those on the sashimi platter, if that is possible. Lastly, aburicious (sp?) is an absolutely must. Blowtorched sushi executed expertly at an affordable price? Must try. Even the mackerel is executed perfectly.  The ambience is quite cozy, so be prepared for that. The only thing I wouldn't recommend ordering is the chicken karage, which is not crispy at all, but soft and rather soft and tasteless."}
{"text":"What a big let down . In comparison to Miku just doesnt compare . Spare yourself and just go straight to Miku !"}
{"text":"My god this place is good! The presentation, the quality and atmosphere is totally on point. I plan on going back again soon. Be prepared to get what you pay for."}
{"text":"The Sushi was amazing and very fresh.  Reservations are usually needed but hey fit us in at the end of the bar.  I had the seafood salad which was to die for"}
{"text":"Hubby and wifey were on the hunt for delicious blowtorched sushi and visited this place (of course, minus the porkiebun coz it was too swanky for a screaming baby).  With that said, hubby and wifey tried all of the items from the aburi menu and indulged their gluttony: aburicious (comes with 2 of everything in the aburi menu), wagyu oshizushi and salmon oshizushi (plus another round of aburicious). Yes, the duo ate all that! *gasp* To change it up just a bit, hubby and wifey shared an order of Tori Nanban. Everything was absolutely delicious but price-wise, hubby thinks other restaurants we've tried had better and cheaper aburi. The tori nanban was superb. The tartar sauce worked surprisingly well with the chicken and the slaw veg. Would recommend to also get the JaBistro roll on its own, which we wished we got instead of the second aburicious, but did get to try.   Would recommend this place to others to at least give it a try. Service was top-notch!!! Absolutely worth mentioning. Amazingly attentive and courteous."}
{"text":"Amazing! The food here was anything that you would ask for. The taste was right on point and very flavorful. The aburi that we ordered was very tasty and the sauce blended right in.  The ambience was very inviting, warm and perfect for a date night.   I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this high-end sushi restaurant! The dining room is essentially one long rectangular box, with a sushi bar on one side and tables on the other side. My friend has been to JaBistro several times before, so I entrusted him to order! We got the sashimi platter, aburicious sushi, JaBistroll, wagyu oshizushi, and agedashi.   The sashimi platter came first, with about 25 pieces of fish. There was salmon, scallops, hamachi, wagyu beef, and sweet shrimp, and two types of tuna to name a few. The fish tasted so fresh and cold when it was served. My personal favourites were the wagyu beef and the fish was blowtorched (unfortunately forget what it was called). We got two different kinds of soy sauce to accompany the sashimi- one was their homemade sweet soy sauce (which I loved!) and the other was a traditional soy sauce (more on the salty side).  The aburicious sushi and JaBistroll came next. I liked the creaminess of the salmon oshizushi, but my favourite has got to be the ebi oshizushi! The tiger shrimp, alongside the blowtorched flavour and topped with mayo made that sushi taste fantastic. The JaBistroll reminded me of the Miku Roll. They're actually made of the same ingredients (salmon, crab, uni, cucumber, and tobiko), so they looked and tasted very similar.   Because I liked the wagyu beef sashimi so much from the platter, we ordered an additional wagyu oshizushi. Unfortunately, it didn't taste as good as a sushi- I think the taste of the beef was masked in this form.  Finally, the agedashi was quite heavy and a lot more filling than anticipated. It came with 4 pieces of deep-fried oyster, which were very juicy and meaty, 2 pieces of deep-fried eggplant, and 2 pieces of deep-fried scallion. At the bottom of the dish was stock made from kelp (kombu) to add a nice hint of flavour.  Service was excellent- the waiters and waitresses were all very friendly, an explained what each dish contained as they were served. They also continuously refilled our water, which I appreciate, since I drink a lot! Would definitely come back here again. :)"}
{"text":"Jabistro has been around for a few years now, making a name for itself as one of the top high-end sushi places in Toronto. While I wasn't blown away by the food or service, it was an enjoyable dinner in a comfortable and cozy environment.  We ordered the sashimi sampler, the aburicious and the Jabistro Roll. Sashimi was good quality and extremely fresh. The cut could've been a bit thicker but it was solid nonetheless. I came for their signature torched sushi so my focus was on the roll and the aburicious.   JaBistro roll had a soft texture and it really just melts in your mouth. The uni gives it a nice creaminess and the torched mayo on top is simply an explosion of flavors. Delicious.   The aburicious comes with 6 pieces (2 salmon, 2 saba and 2 ebi) of torched pressed sushi and 2 pieces of the Jabistro roll. They all had that wonderful smokey flavor but my favorite was the ebi which was combined with a basil mayonnaise. As for the least favorite....I've never been a big fan of saba but this wasn't bad. A-OK but I wouldnt get it again. The pressed sushi is fairly filling as the rice portion is quite thick. I would've preferred less of it but the rice was perfect so I can't complain.  They have real wasabi which isn't spicy or overwhelmingly strong like the typical kind that's served in lower end sushi places. It's a nice change because it's actually more sweet. Make sure to try this!  I also would suggest to get a drink! They have a lot of interesting concoctions on the menu. I can't remember the name of the one I ordered (nashi dashi? Lol) but I loved it.  It's a small space and tables are very close together. If your neighbors spoke loud enough or if you were listening closely, entire conversations can be heard very clearly. So if you're looking for an intimate setting, I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi restaurant in Toronto! Simply the best selection of the freshest fish possible in Toronto. The owner of Jabistro is in fact the owner of Guu and as a huge fan of Guu was well, Jabistro definitely did not disappoint. Although pricey, the price is justified as you simply cannot have the same quality of fish elsewhere in Toronto.   We had the sashimi platter with the lobster option - every piece of sashimi was fresh and amazing. This was the first time I had lobster sashimi and it blew my mind away - it was not only creamy but also very silky. Great value for my money. We also had the blowtorched sushi and it was SOOO good - the pieces were literally devoured within seconds. The lobster miso soup was delicious and came with the sashimi platter - we both loved it!   I will definitely come back to Jabistro to try out the rest of their menu items!"}
{"text":"Excellent - one of the best sushi places in Toronto. Great service and a huge sale selection."}
{"text":"Amazing high end Japanese restaurant specializing in aburri, or blow torched, sushi.  My go-tos are lobster miso soup, salmon roll, and aburicious roll.  Lucky to have this high end Japanese restaurant as my neighborhood sushi spot!"}
{"text":"Not one to commit to the official title of \"My Favourite Restaurant\", but I finally get what it means when they say \"you just haven't met the right one yet.\" Because Ja, I think I have just met my match.   What we got:  Aburicious ($20): The Noah's Arc of sushi rolls, two of every kind. This is the perfect plate to order if it is your first time at Ja and wanted to sample all of the aburri sushi. The ebi aka shrimp oshizushi was particularly impressive, so much that we decided to add it to our order separately ($14). Can I just say that if you're at Ja, you HAVE to get at least one aburri sushi? I've been around the aburri block, so trust me, no one can blowtorch like Ja can.  Lobster carpaccio ($18): Delicious! Even though I am not typically a huge fan of carpaccio, this was like a party in your mouth where seared lobster, onions, arugula, and an explosion of citric flavours were all invited. Uni Cream Pasta ($18): Uni seems to be an acquired taste. This dish is a good intro to uni if you want to acquire this taste. The brininess of the sea urchin pairs well with the creamy pasta. Jalapimo ($6): Deep fried potato balls, can't go wrong with deep fried starch. Assorted sushi pieces ($5-8?) - What can I say, all super fresh and delicious. Dessert: Chocolate ganache ($10) and Yuzu tart ($10)- Unique and beautifully presented. Plus they both come with vanilla ice cream.  In the other categories of decor and service- equally above and beyond amazing. Ja, congrats on winning my heart and commitment*.    *In the category of Japanese restaurants, that is"}
{"text":"Worst service. I asked five times for water. Waited twenty five minutes for the bill after asking. Asked for a separate bill and got the whole tables worth., Sushi was soggy. And waiter was more concerned with keeping a good posture and securing his perfect hair than getting the freaken water. A waiter should not be allowed to serve at a high class restaurant wearing ginormous white earrings. Prices are way to high for what you get (taste and quantity)"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi experiences I have ever had.  At first, the entranceway was completely obscured by the line of people waiting to get into the comedy club or something just next door. We had to wade through the crowd to make sure we were in the right place. Good thing we did though.  It wasn't too busy for a Saturday evening, and my good friend and I were seated right away since we opted for a sushi bar seat....  Right in front of the \"aburi' station. Man, we were drooling before we even sat down!  I want to blowtorch all my sushi now! (not really.. but if it tastes as good as they make it here!)  Between the two of us, a sashimi plate and some of their aburi was more than sufficient for a light dinner. Okay so there was some nigori and other liquors involved too.  The staff was incredibly considerate and attentive. They even took our picture as we left - but as I later found out on Facebook - they do that every night!"}
{"text":"Beautiful decor and ambiance, great satisfying japanese food, good service. This one is a winner!  Recommended"}
{"text":"one year later and I came back with the same friend, seated at the same spot and ordered almost the same menu items. The only difference was that we had a different chef.  I don't know why it took me so long to write a review for this exquisite restaurant. This is definitely a place to impress someone who worships sushi. WARNING- they'll never enjoy regular sushi ever again.   Food: +Chef special nigiri: Chef prepared the nigiri right infront of us, i was a bit disappointed since there was a communication barrier and I didn't know half of the fish that i was eating. But still orgasmic +hokkaido salad: very refreshing and pretty huge! it could probably be shared between 3 people +tori nanban: i didn't find anything special about this dish. It was fried chicken with tartar sauce and cabbage +pork belly (daily special): bang for your buck! beautiful presentation as well. however, it wasn't as tender as i had hope.   Verdict: yes...we ordered way too much for two ._. But we wouldn't have wanted it any other way.    Atmosphere: It was nice and cozy. Wasn't loud as an izakaya so you could have a decent conversation without yelling. This place filled up quickly. So i highly suggest to make a reservation. It was monday night and packed with a line up."}
{"text":"Great place for unique sushi rolls. My fave and must try is the jabistro roll- the sauce gushes in your mouth. I would recommend reserving as it is quite busy. The sashimi is very fresh and they have unique pieces like uni and ebi- those are my fave, not many places have fresh ones."}
{"text":"The service at this restaurant is stellar. I've been here twice and have tried everything on the sushi and sashimi menu. The quality of the fish, and plating is amazing. This is as good as it gets in Toronto but be prepared for a hefty bill. It is well worth the price! I intend to keep coming back until I try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"JaBistro is my favourite Japanese restaurant in Toronto, hands down.  I came here for dinner with my girlfriend and her parents, to celebrate a birthday, and I knew JaBistro would be the perfect place to take them.  We ordered the large sashimi platter, a kyukyoku for each person, an ebi oshizushi, and a JaBistroll.  The large sashimi platter is one of my favourites here. The variety in sashimi selection on the platter, as well as the freshness and preparation of the ingredients makes me one happy camper. That night was no exception, as we happily made our way through the platter, even eating the fried fish pieces and shrimp heads that are probably for presentation.  After we polished off the platter, our kyukyoku came, which had 9 pieces of nigiri sushi. I couldn't recall all of the names of the pieces, but I do know that we enjoyed every single one, and we saved the toro for the very end. A fitting end too, as that melt-in-your-mouth, buttery soft piece of toro is nothing short of incredible.  The ebi oshizushi and JaBistroll came at the end, when most of my party was already very full, but we still ate our way through because both were delicious. The ebi oshizushi came perfectly cooked, with that great sauce on the top of the shrimp, and I basically made it disappear before anyone could stop me. The JaBistroll, which I had never had until this evening, was soft and tasty, and I was very pleased that I was able to try it out that night.  Overall, our meal at JaBistro was amazing. The food was fantastic, the service was friendly and impeccable, and I couldn't have asked for a better place to celebrate a birthday.  Again, JaBistro is my favourite Japanese restaurant in Toronto, and every visit I make reaffirms that feeling.  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"They're my favorite sushi to go place in downtown! I love Japanese food and this is one of the best japanese restaurants I've tried in Toronto so far. Everything was fresh and flavorful, servers are attentive too."}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I had dinner at JaBistro in March 2017 for his birthday. Everything overall was delicious! The restaurant was comfortable and the service was attentive.   We both ordered the kyukyoku ($55), which included 11 pieces of nigiri. My fianc√© added a piece of tuna collar/ kamatoro ($16), pricy but it was something he really wanted to try.The kamatoro had a very strong tuna flavour and was oily (good or bad depending on your likes). All of the nigiri tasted really fresh and the pieces were pretty large. Some of the more unique ones (to us) were wagyu beef and abalone. The rice had a nice texture and went perfectly with the fish.   We also had an aburicious ($20) to share. Of the 4 blow-torched items, our favourite was the salmon oshizushi. We thought the JaBistroll and ebi pieces were a bit too rich (maybe we were just feeling heavy because we had just eaten the kyukyoku sets). The torched flavour was really fun for all the types.   It was a Tuesday so there were maguro specials, but we didn't go for anything besides the kamatoro because it was our first time there. We were very full and satisfied after the meal! Will likely return to try some other items and drinks."}
{"text":"I have only ever tried the Omakase (chefs choice) and at the bar as well. I also have never been here with more than 2 people (including myself). I have been here a few times on the weekend for Omakase where it was very busy and the chefs didn't have as much time to spend with you. I just try to be extra patient as I understand weekends are hectic for them sometimes. Reserve ahead!  I would imagine if you just came here to order some pieces of sashimi and some rolls that it might not leave a lasting impression on you (apart from your wallet).. but you really have to try the Omakase. Unless its a weekend, the omakase experience is usually good. I love the freshness of the fish, the texture/temperature/taste of the rice, and just the right amount of soya sauce on top and wasabi underneath. I have also tried Zen's Omakase which I also like but for some reason prefer JaBistro - maybe because I really like the torched rolls as well. Though both restaurants are excellent.   Their torched/aburi rolls are excellent. All of them."}
{"text":"The freshest, most mouth-watering sushi I've ever had! Amazing presentation and ambience. If you're looking for a place to enjoy high-quality sushi, this is the place to go. Even though the portions may seem small for the price, I guarantee it will fill you up and be worth it!"}
{"text":"Love love!! Amazing atmosphere!! Employees very knowledgeable about everything on the menu!! And the food is breathtaking!! Just simply amazing!! Highly recommend l! I can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow! I love this place and can't wait to eat here again when I visit Toronto. The sushi is exquisite to the eyes, and it tastes as beautiful as it looks. Eat the torched sushi, you won't regret it. Came here for lunch and had the 7-piece....albeit it's pricey but so worth the money."}
{"text":"Wow! I loved it!   Been meaning to try here once in the past, but there were literally no room for us so months later we tried again.  So worth it. every bite of the 100 dollar of sashimi plate was heaven! I loved the sea bream the most - and it was all very different textures and tastes that kept my taste buds dancing. I love that it's all market fresh, depending what's in season they serve whatever that's the best. The creative decoration of my sashimi plate was also out of this world.   Will definitely come back, so delicious!!!!   only reason it's not 5 stars, there was one oyster that was a bit fishy... i don't like fishy oysters."}
{"text":"The lobster miso soup at Jabistro was something else, best miso soup I've had to date. It was $5 if I remembered correctly.  Got the kyukyoku ($45 and usually it's $55 but they ran out of 2 types of fish so 11 pieces became 9 pieces). I primarily came here because I was missing Japan. Also, it was close and I wanted toro. This set had Toro.  Toro - not good Quite disappointed in the piece I got though. It had stringy parts to it. I couldn't bite through it and I ended up needing to spit out the stringy part. I know there were better cuts because I saw that another table was delivered a set with a nicer piece of toro.   Shrimp- can not see the shrimp For the shrimp nigiri that I was given at Jabistro, I couldn't see the  shrimp.. I dare u to look at the picture and tell me which one the shrimp is! Lol, it's the one that looks like it's got nothing on it. It also didn't taste like anything except a dash of soysauce and sushi rice. I know it's supposed to be shrimp because the waitress introduced each of the pieces when she brought the plate. I think it's very strange considering that for the other food pictures on Yelp, I could actually SEE the shrimp. Did they run out and cut the shrimp into granular pieces? No idea. Maybe they forgot to put the shrimp on the rice. Very possible.  With the other pieces, they were pretty good. I particularly liked the rainbow trout and seabream ( I believe it was).  However, personally, I don't think I'll be coming back. I also just went to Ayoyama recently and I'd dare to say their sashimi & sushi is more fresh. Try Ayoyama some time :) it's really nice and more price effective. It's $97 for their omakase set which comes with over 20 pieces of sushi. It also has more variety. (It's for 2 people).  But if I was ever feeling a deep craving for sushi, I'd guess maybe I'd reconsider coming back...?  (the other pieces weren't bad hmm...)  Nvm forget that train of thought.   I'd bus up to Ayoyama and eat sushi there. Lol!"}
{"text":"I had made reservations for myself and my husband and after finally securing a babysitter we were on our way out! Good thing we left the baby at home because this modern decor did not seem baby stroller friendly especially on a busy night... which it surprisingly was for a Tuesday. Due to being over 15 minutes late, we had lost our reservation and had to wait. The next available seat were two spots at the bar which was all right but you definitely felt alienated from the rest of the commotion going on in the restaurant because you're so close to the entrance and far from watching how the sushi is made.  I really have to thank my fellow Yelpers that have been here because if it weren't for my quick glimpse at the reviews beforehand I wouldn't have known what to order. My husband and I are true novices when it comes to *real* sushi. We ended up ordering the blowtorched aburi, pressed shrimp and a pair of hand rolls recommended to us by our server (I think she sensed that we were a little over our head). My husband also got a miso soup which was made with a lobster broth and I got the lobster bisque which ended up being a cold soup. I didn't think I'd be into a cold soup but it was a hot day so it ended up being perfect.  Our food came out fairly quick. The hand rolls were great. I just wish I remembered what they were... and the blow torched aburi was delicious as well. We didn't really know what we were eating (heh). My favourite was the pressed shrimp.   Now prior to all this my husband was wary that the sushi we were getting was mostly \"raw\" (I told you we were novices) but I assured him that this was how it's traditionally done and that he should go into this openminded. He did and he was pleased with how everything tasted but later on it became clear that something did not agree with him. I, on the other hand, felt completely fine with not even a twinge of digestive discomfort.  I recommend if you want a sushi experience that is not your typical, Western-washed fare compared to how some places can get but not if you tend to have an iffy stomach."}
{"text":"This was one of the best sushi places I have been to! The interior design was very modern and it is a small restaurant that is best for intimate and romantic dinners.   Their sushi was very fresh and everything just melted in your mouth! Service at the restaurant was very great, there was no more lobster sashimi that night so our server offered us omakase at a lower price since we were already sitting at the bar. You are able to see the sushi chefs make each sushi and they also explained where each piece of fish was from."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times but after trying out sushi restaurants in other countries and having a few omakase experiences, I just don't feel it's great as it used to be. Customer service is always good. Nonetheless, I still recommend you to try it out if you're looking for very good sushi in Toronto!  First Visit Lobster Platter ($85/$135) This had a good selection of fish and everything was fresh. Highly recommended if you want to try a little bit of everything.  Lobster Broth Miso Soup ($5) I believe this comes with the platter. This is one of my favourite miso soups and you also receive a nice lobster claw. The soup has a sweetness to it from the lobster and it's very tasty.  Aburi ($28) This platter is a good mix of the different kinds of Aburi they have if you want to try a bit of everything.  Scallop Nigiri (n/a) Unfortunately, I don't remember the price. I'm a huge fan of scallops and this was a very traditional preparation with the soy sauce already brushed onto the sushi. Very delicious piece!  Most Recent Visit Lobster Platter  Ebi Oshizushi ($15) & Salmon Oshizushi ($17) These ones were my favourite out of the Aburi so we ordered only these two types. The flavours work very well together and they do a good job with the torching and the amount of sauce.  Uni Nigiri (N/A) This piece was somewhat mediocre. I've had better at other restaurants but it could be a seasonality thing or maybe the batch that day wasn't amazing."}
{"text":"Great service, unbelievable raw fish, and imaginative design.  The only down side is that the tables are so close it can be a bit too loud to hear.  I'd definitely come back again."}
{"text":"This is the most exquisite Japanese restaurant that I have ever been to! If you love fresh sashimi, flavourful sushi, and Japanese infusion foods in general, then you will fall in love with JaBistro like I did!  I went here on a Thursday evening for dinner. It was quite busy, so I would advise to make a reservation beforehand. The restaurant is very chic, with dim lighting and a sushi bar along one wall. It's the perfect setting for a romantic date, or just hanging out with friends.  I went with two other friends. We ordered a large lobster platter ($130), salmon oshizushi ($16/6pcs), aburicious ($20/8pcs). The lobster platter seems to be the favourite at JaBistro. It comes with an assortment of sashimi pieces, including lobster, tuna, scallop, squid, and other items. First bite into a piece of lobster sashimi, and I immediately fell in love with the fresh taste! I have never tasted lobster as fresh as this! I'm a big seafood fan, so I have had my fair share of lobster, but nothing compares to this. The scallops were my second most favourite item on the platter. It's slightly sweet and very tender. The salmon oshizushi and aburicious are sushi pieces, cut into a perfect rectangular shape, and topped with different delicious sauces. I loved them as well, but I feel that it's more Japanese fusion cuisine rather than traditional Japanese food. To prove how delicious all of the foods were, I barely dipped anything into soy sauce and wasabi, because I didn't want to ruin the flavours!  Also, I've heard that the Japanese are known for their top quality customer service, and I would definitely agree after going to JaBistro. The waiter that served us was very attentive. Since we were a party of three, he requested for the aburicious to come with 3 pcs of each type of sushi rather than 2 pcs. I thought that was very thoughtful. My friends and I were very pleased with our dining experience! JaBistro will be my first Yelp bookmark."}
{"text":"Hands down amazing. The sushi was incredibly fresh and the service was amazing! I went with one of my good friends and we had the lobster miso soup which was good but not phenomenal, it only came with one small piece of lobster. Then we each had their handroll special: tuna. They were $8 each and well worth it. The sushi rice is so flavourful I would eat is alone. Then we had their sampler, it was about 22 assorted pieces for $50. I didn't love the shrimp or scallop but the rest were melt in your mouth fresh! We also tried a mix of their torched sushi, $20 for 8 pieces and each piece was to be savoured. My favourite was hands down the torched salmon. The shrimp one had a bit too much sauce on it and the mackerel was a bit too fishy. We finished off with the green tea creme br√ªl√©e which had the most perfect caramelized crust and the red wine poached pear which tasted like Christmas. The servers were very friendly and my water glass was never empty. Even though we ordered all the food together, they brought everything out separately which I loved because I didn't feel rushed and I really got to take my time with every dish, it was like having a five course meal! I also recommend sitting at the bar because it's fun watching the chefs prepare the food. I can't wait to go back to try their sushi lunch!"}
{"text":"the place is so lit,the food is so lit, the service is so lit. Definitely one of the most lit restaurant in Toronto"}
{"text":"This sushi place never lets me down on taste and quality. My wife and I have made this place our go to place for our birthdays and anniversaries. The Kyukyoku and aburicious are our favorite menu choices."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came for dinner the other day, and everything was fresh, flavorful, and fabulous. It's comparable to some of the better places I've visited in Tokyo and better than Shiro's in Seattle.  We had two of the rolls ($20-22), a salad ($8), two pieces of nigiri, and the deluxe sushi set (8 pieces for $55). I highly recommend the JaBistroll, which is a very creative and unique roll containing snow crab, uni, roe, and other stuff - it just melts in your mouth!  The waitstaff was also very friendly and attentive, and they were helpful with my onion/garlic allergy. The interior is clean and modern. The only annoying thing was that our table legs were dirty with soy sauce.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Favorite gourmet sushi spot! These guys add flair to standard sushi options in Toronto. The Blowtorched special rolls are to die for and we had a great experience sitting at the bar and getting introduced to some amazing sake options. A total hidden gem."}
{"text":"The food is so good, we tried a few items from the menu, our favorite was the salmon pressed sushi, in this restaurant there is no soy sauce needed, the sushi itself is full of flavour.   The best of all was the bartender, he was very knowledgeable, he took his time making the drinks and really put soul into them, I'm kind of peculiar when it comes to drinks, I like them well done and he was absolutely amazing performing his job. We were very happy."}
{"text":"fresh and delicious sushi! really good, lots of sashimi (but I'm not a big fan of raw seafood)."}
{"text":"Finally get to try this popular Japanese restaurant around the Financial District.  I came here on a weekday after work to catch up with a friend and this place was already packed.  Good thing we made reservation so we didn't have to wait to be seated.  The decoration in this restaurant is beautiful.  Very modern decoration with fancy white bricks designs on the wall with beautiful lighting all over the restaurant.  For two people, we ordered the Lobster Platter (comes with two lobster soups), Aburi sushi (blowtorched sushi) and two pieces of O-Toro sushi.  The portions were just right for two people!  For people who love lobster sashimi or would like to try it, I highly recommend going with the lobster platter ($80) over the regular platter ($50).  The Lobster Platter comes with two lobster soups ($5 each) and if you do the math, for only an additional $20, you are getting the premium lobster sashimi!  The platter was great and all sashimi were super fresh!  O-Toro was so good as well, the tuna melted in my month.  The Aburi blowtorched sushi was also very tasty if you want to try something different.  Overall, I was SUPER happy with the food, the service and the environment.  Although it did put a good dent in my wallet, I thought it was worth it!  I will be sure to return for special occasions!"}
{"text":"I brought my wife here on Fri, Feb 10th for an early valentines dinner as i've heard great things about this place.   We had a reservation for 8PM but we arrived at 7:15PM so we decided to stay by the drink bar and have some beers.   There was a small chalk board sign right at the bar that said special warm cocktail $10 that my wife liked as the bartender was nice enough to offer us some samples.  I ordered the large bottle of Asahi.  Come around 7:30PM, we were notified that there was a cancellation so we can take their spot at the sushi bar.  Fantastic.  We ordered small Sashimi platter, Aburicious (8 pc assortment of torched nigiri) & Nama which is 7 pc classic nigiri dish.  We are not big eaters and this was just right in terms of quantity.  Raw fish (sashimi/nigiri) was good quality and sushi rice was very very well done.  But considering 7 pc nigiri $27 which would be almost $4 per piece, i felt i had just as good of nigiri in terms of fish quality at half the price of this.  But i must say that Aburicious was AMAZING!  hands down the best rolls, aburi i've had! I'd go back just to eat them again and likely pass on Sashimi/Sushi.  Then we got the bill and it rang up to $137 before tip.  While carefully going through each item, i saw that we were charged $12 for the cocktail that we saw their 'special cocktail' sign for $10.  Now, this is where it ALL went south for us after having a pretty decent experience.  I pointed this out to the female hostess/server and she brought the menu and correct me that it is $12.  I pointed the small chalk board \"special sign\", at which point, she walked to the bar, removed the sign, whispered something to the bartender which i assume \"special is not on tonight...\" or something along that line and comes back to our table with the machine and completely pretends like nothing happened... ARE YOU SERIOUS?  For extra $2, which was clearly the mistake of the restaurant, you would NOT honour the special price while I watch the entire debacle unfold as to what she did?  For this, I gave the service 0/5 stars.. I know it's bit harsh as the server that attended to us during dinner was completely different person and you can't technically give 0/5 star in yelp, i chose to for the fact that JaBistro isn't some hole in the wall type of a place and what happened here over $2 and the impression that was left with us while supposedly being the top calibre japanes restaurant in Toronto, certainly deserves 0/5 stars.  I would give the food 4/5 stars so this is how i got to 2/5 stars overall."}
{"text":"Not the most special Japanese I've had but it was good for the price. I had the Smoked Duck which was lovely, only thing that overpowered it a bit was the raw-ish egg in it. For Sushi we got the salmon/ snow crab blow torched which was a new texture it almost seemed like hot food gone cold. A bit if a soggy taste. Personally I would have preferred it without the torching. I had the calamari and the shrimp. Both of these dishes I'd advise highly to stay away from!! The calamari was like something from a cheap seafood place as was the prawns. The dessert was nice! I got the donuts in tofu cream and the brownie. Both were yummy. By far my favorite thing was their green tea mojittos"}
{"text":"Very good food here my favourite is the jabistro roll, this place lives up to the hype. Sashimi is always super fresh and top notch. It is kind of expensive.. I got the sashimi platter for $100 and wasn't 100% sure what I was eating (pertaining the the fish sashimi). Our waitress did tell us which they were but her English wasn't the best to be honest. Other than that, food came quickly. Ambiance in the restaurant is nice too. Will definitely be back but maybe just for the jabistro roll."}
{"text":"Food: 4.5/5 Service: 2  JaBistro is normally our \"go-to\" sushi spot. Great food, nice ambiance, fine prices. Good enough for a solid sushi meal.   Tonight was different. Our server seemed to rush our entire meal, even though we had an hour and a half before they needed our table. She insisted we ordered our food before we decided on our drinks - and even when we tried to delay our food after our drink order, she brought the bottle of wine immediately after our food came out. We had to wait for our drinks before we ate, and by the time we could try our food our torched sushi was already cold.  The other servers were great as usual - they took our jackets soon after we sat down and our water glasses were always topped off. It's a shame we couldn't say the same about our server refilling our wine, who also didn't get the credit card machine for our bill - another server had to notice we weren't attended to.  The food, when hot, was also great.   I sure hope this experience was a one-off. On any other day I'd rate this place a solid 4 stars. If it's not, we'll be searching for a new sushi spot."}
{"text":"Expensive but truly amazing sushi. They do blowtorch stuff like nobody's business. One of my absolute favourite sushi joints. Highly recommend their salmon nigiri."}
{"text":"We went here on a whim (Saturday night no less) and were so pleasantly surprised. We did a shashimi sampler, plus their pressed crab and pressed salmon sushi (nigiri style), plus deep fried scallops and miso steamed cod. The sampler was amazing. Their fish is fresh, selection changes daily, and provided good variety (including some of the best toro I've ever had). Salmon tends to be my least favorite fish in the states but was istantly my favorite here (go figure). I highly recommend calling ahead for a table as we sat at bar and while service was fast and friendly, it would be more comfortable at a table!"}
{"text":"RESERVATION DISASTER!  We were excited to try the new restaurant at 222 Richmond St W, Toronto, recently opened by James HyunSoo Kim, the owner of the Guu chain of restaurants (Vancouver and Toronto).  We went to the website and made a reservation for 6:30 pm online, receiving an email indicating that our reservation for 6:30 pm was confirmed.  When we arrived at 6:30 pm, we were greeted by staff who were surprised by our appearance and had to open up a laptop near the the entrance to look for our online reservation.  Shortly afterwards, the hostess said she would be right back, upon which she came back with a manager who told us that there were many reservations between 6:30 pm and 7:30 pm, and, despite the emailed confirmation we received, we should have called before coming to confirm our reservation.  He told us that they were full between 6:30 pm and 7;30 pm, and he reluctantly suggested that we might sit at the bar, but he clearly wasn't encouraging us to stay.  In effect, he was blaming us for not calling ahead to confirm our reservation (which had already been confirmed by them to us in writing via email).  We left the restaurant, clearly not feeling welcome.  We looked again at the emailed confirmation, which made no mention of us having to call and confirm the reservation -- the email itself said, \"your reservation for 6:30 pm is confirmed...\"  These folks need to fix their online reservation process.  As well, they need to consider having a manager on staff who has some table manners to make people feel welcome, rather than encouraging people to leave..... We know that the Guu chain has been successful, but surely it has been successful because it welcomes people to come and try their food rather than send them away."}
{"text":"Everything was visually stunning and wonderfully flavourful."}
{"text":"JaBistro is my favourite restaurant in the city! The food is amazing and authentic, ambiance is nice, and prices are reasonable considering the quality you receive. If you're looking for a place to splurge, this is the place to go.  My favourite dishes to order are the lobster sashimi platter, lobster miso soup, and Kyukyoku. The lobster miso soup is complimentary to everyone at your table when you order the lobster sashimi platter, which is good to know if you are looking to get more value out of your meal. The sashimi is very fresh and the presentation is always on point. My absolute favourite dish here is the Kyukyoku, chefs choice of 11 pieces of nigiri (sometimes it is 9 pieces). After trying this dish, I cannot eat sushi the same at most restaurants nowadays! The pieces vary each visit, but the nigiri is always high quality and seasoned well. It is a similar concept to omakase, but the sushi is served all at once. However if you sit at the bar I believe the sushi chefs can serve you piece by piece upon request.  Definitely a place worth trying!"}
{"text":"My God, is this place ever amazing!  The Guu empire in Toronto grows; first with Guu Toronto on Church street 3 years ago, then Guu Sakabar, then Kinton Ramen - now JaBistro!  Currently in a 2 months soft opening, I first heard of this place from a friend who wrote and photographed it.  Having met her while shooting a wedding in Jamaica, how I would immediately hang up my camera to do her job. She eats and reviews for a living, how great is that???  Anyway, being ecstatic that for once, a Guu owned restaurant actually takes reservations, I called it in 3 weeks in advance for 7pm.  On the day of, I had to push it back an hour and JaBistro was more than able to for us. Awesome!  Situated next to Yuk Yuk's on Richmond street, on one light snowy night on a weekend, we party of 2 arrived promptly 5 minutes before our reservation.  We were warmly greeted immediately when we entered behind the dark sealing door by our British accented hostess who is actually Asian.  Oh how I do love the Brit accent.  We were seated near the back, allowing us an entire view of their brick accented walls lit up below by potted lights. From where we sat we could see the bartender in action, as well as the sushi chef hard at work with his blow torch delivering what I could see were authentic aburi sushi.  My mouth begins to water.  Our Japanese waiter arrived shortly our coats were taken away by our gracious hostess (awesome of them to do this btw!) as we sat down to our seat.  Mind you, there wasn't any much of back support if you sit on the outside vs. the cushion high seats when seated on the inside.   Our waiter asked for our drink and we sent him packing to bring us back some water, we were parched!    Items ordered of the night were:  - snack bite - seared mackarel, deep fried ahi tuna bites drizzled with special mayo.  - deep fried calamari  - salmon pie (looked like a big hot pocket) - sashimi platter 50 (add $25 for a 2 pounds lobster sashimi) - railroad man cocktail   The highlight had to be abso-f**king-lutely the fresh out of water melt in your mouth sashimi!  Next to it would be the salmon pie.  My God, it was as if the ocean was in the kitchen and the sushi chef reached in and pulled out a still flipping around tuna and yellowtail and prepared it right there on the spot.  I could taste and savour the sweet buttery toro sashimi as it melted in my mouth, its flavor tingling all my taste buds.  I savored each and every bite of the entire sashimi plate that was $50, more than well worth its value. I wonder what other goodness the $100 platter would bring, next time, definitely next time I said to my gf.  Each and every morsel of sashimi including yellowtail, sweet shrimp, sea urchin were to die for. Each and every piece oozing of freshness that you could otherwise never find in your atypical sushi restaurant.  After this night I swore I would never ever subject my mouth to bland sushi that is available in your run of the mill Japanese restaurant!   To top it all off, the wasabi was freshly grated directly from its root and not the out of the toothpaste tube dried wasabi that permeats every Japanese restaurant from here to Alburquerque.   Our waiter came to our table asking how everything was, I looked at him dead in the eye and said, \"You must tell your kitchen that everything is marvelous, best sushi ever bar none.  Never have we tasted sushi more fresh than this.\"  He grinned and said thank you as he passed the message on.    Every thing we tried that evening was fantastic, the salmon pie was moist and tender to the taste, even the pastry that surrounded it was ever aromatic of a sweet scent that cultivates the senses.  We enjoyed each and every bite to the last, including the calamari that was just as good as everything else.  I typically hate calamari in your typical restaurant but this place has certainly reinvented it for me! I 'll never have calamari anywhere else ever again!    You owe it to yourself to come here and try this place out, maybe even make it your go to place for the best sashimi in town.  Once soft opening is over (January 1st according to our waiter), people will be lining up around the block for it. Lunch will also be added.  Bring a clean taste bud, a heavy wallet and be prepared to be dazzled by one of the best if not THE best Japanese restaurant in town!  You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend were craving sushi so we decided to try this place. Its a pretty small restaurant and you should definitely make reservations before stopping in. We reserved at the sushi bar so we could watch the sushi chefs prepare the rolls. We ordered the lobster miso soup which we loved, I'm not too crazy about miso soup but this one was amazing, the subtle hint of lobster is what makes it so unique. We then ordered  the tester platter (not too sure what the name was exactly) just so we could see what we wanted to order, the platter came with 4 varieties of rolls and 2 pieces of each, from left to right we tried the salmon, mackerel and tiger shrimp pressed sushi and the ja bistro roll. We loved them all but the salmon was definitely my absolute favourite, the torch made it taste almost smoked and the jalape√±o added the perfect amount of heat. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves sushi. Everything had so much flavour and dimension it left us wanting more. The only reason i gave this place a 4 star instead of a 5 is definitely because of the price point, 6 pieces of sushi for $16-22 is definitely not in my price range but its good to splurge once in awhile!!"}
{"text":"I was blown away by this experience. Fine Japanese dining in a modern setting. Everything was delicious. We ordered the large sashimi platter which was gorgeous to look at as it was delicious, and a few of their torched sushi plates. YUM!  This is my new favourite place for sashimi!  Yes, it is a bit pricier than its competitors (Zen, Aoyama, Le Cafe Michi) but you can literally taste and feel the difference in experience. However, it is a bargain when compared to the other (overpriced?) sushi joints that are $300/person."}
{"text":"I was here recently and just don't see what all the hype is about.  The food was just ok.  I loved the atmosphere and ambiance, but the food is supposed to be the real reason to go.  The first thing I noticed upon entering was an overwhelming smell of fish.  Yes, I know they serve sushi and sashimi, but it smelled more like a fish market than a restaurant.  Service was attentive, but it just did not make up for the food."}
{"text":"Brought my cousin and niece here. They liked the food and the decoration. They seem have a special menu and many dishes I have not found in other places."}
{"text":"I'm torn about my review of Jabistro. This is the third time I've been, second in the last two months, but I have to say that this was probably my least favourable experience. Kudos to them for opening on New Years because I had tried to book other Japanese establishments, all which had decided to take NYD off.   They were celebrating their third year anniversary and as a nice gesture, they offered all patrons a one ounce sake or a hand roll. Both were very nice.  We ordered the one hundred dollar sashimi platter and it came out in beautiful fashion, with a beautiful assortment of fish. However, I found the service to be very rushed. While the fish was being explained to us, some one else was intruding with all the plates of soy sauce, leaving everyone distracted and unable to pay attention. My other two times was not like this. One came after another with much patience and well timed. I felt very rushed.  We also ordered several aburi rolls to share. While the wagyu roll was tasty, there was an extreme inconsistency when it came to the size of each piece, some thicker than others, while others just barely covering the sushi rice.  We also ordered the assorted aburi, which I have had before.... That first time I tried it, I remember how perfectly torched it was,.. This time, I felt that it was very careless, and over torched. Several pieces felt burnt, and the cream sauce on top was very heavy handed, leaving me disappointed.  While I really want to give this time three star, in reality... I've had better, both here and elsewhere."}
{"text":"What can I say?!? When you want the freshest fish in Toronto, you should hit up Ja Bistro. The quality and presentation is out of this world. I went with two of my girlfriends and we split the sashimi platter (the bigger one), pork belly and aburicious. We paid roughly $60 per person for dinner. Besides having the freshest fish, Ja Bistro is known for their blow torched sushi. Let me tell you it is well worth it! The torched sushi is full of delicious flavours and your mouth will be thanking you the minute you have your first bite."}
{"text":"This spot is definitely more on the drinking and chill side rather than the food side. We didn't have a wait so that was a huge plus. We got to sit in this outside-awning area that looked very nice. I ordered the Wagyu sushi and a Sapporo. For the first time tasting Wagyu, it was very good. The sushi was blowtorched which added a unique element over other places.  Why three stars? Two main reasons. For one, pricing. For six pieces of sushi, it was $25 CAD. I get that it's Wagyu but it's still very expensive. Additionally, the waiter forgot my Sapporo and didn't remember it until I reminded him. Those issues aside, great, modern place. Definitely has a high(er) class vibe to it."}
{"text":"What an amazing spot! I really love the chic and upscale vibe here - a nice change from most sushi joints! Secondly, the service here is impeccable. Very attentive, friendly and efficient. Thirdly, the food is spectacular! Definitely some of the best sushi I have ever had. Every piece of fish that I ate was extremely fresh (literally melt in your mouth fresh). And the lobster miso soup is by far the best miso soup I've ever had. This restaurant is a bit on the pricey side but you get what you pay for and it is worth every single cent. If you're looking for authentic and delicious food then you should go to JaBistro!"}
{"text":"Ate dinner at this location while in Toronto. A lovely atmosphere and wait staff. Ordered the sashimi platter and a blowtorch option to share with a dining mate. For drink choice, ordered the 9 oz Sauvignon Blanc. There is also a list of Sake, non alcoholic beverages, and beers. The presentation of the food was exceptional, and there were a variety of choices on the platter. I would recommend this restaurant to a friend or colleague visiting the city."}
{"text":"All the blowtorch ones are so good. The best one are sashimi platter and Jabistroll. Make reservations!"}
{"text":"I would love to give this place a higher rating-if nothing else based on the level of service alone. There wasn't a single moment where you were not tended to - they truly make you feel like they have 3 people per guest to take care. That said, the food let us down. Jabistro rumoured to be better than Miku - but the food did not hold up when it came to the box pressed sushi or their signature roll.  We had the sashimi platter at ($50) and it was beautifully presented and the fish were fresh. My friend and I ordered a sampler platter each for the pressed sushi - the rice was falling apart and overall were too wet / oily.   The matcha creme br√ªl√©e also didn't stand out.   Sorry guys - high expectations led to somewhat of a letdown."}
{"text":"I have to say, this place was a bit of a let down. My boyfriend and I wanted to try this place because of the hype, and maybe it's because we got spoiled from other higher end sushi restaurants, but it definitely did not live up to it. This place more like, the atmosphere and prices say \"high end\", but the taste doesn't live up to it.  We had 2 orders of kyukyoku (one order had 9 sushi) and one order of aburicious. We first got aburicious, the pressed sushi, which had too much rice. Then we got kyukyoku, where we noticed the quality of the fish right away. The quality was not the best, like you could tell it wouldn't taste that great (think of when picking out raw steak meat at the grocery store). We didn't want to eat it anymore after trying about 3-4 different types of sushi, so packed the rest home just because we didn't want it to go to waste either."}
{"text":"Been a handful of times and never leave disappointed - blowtorched rolls are a no brainer (I'd recommend the JaBistroll for first-timers). Sashimi is fresh but portions are scarce so it's slightly overpriced. Daily specials usually include something worth trying, and service is great. Good for business lunches and warm-weather patio seating upstairs."}
{"text":"Came here a few years ago when it was hot, I remember it being a great place! everything was very good, and the staff was amazing. Highly recommended if you love sea food and Japanese cuisine."}
{"text":"Very fresh sushi. Great service. The prices are on the higher side but the quality is definitely worth it. We tried the sampler platter, the aburi, and the sushi, all extremely well done. Love their house made soya sauce too"}
{"text":"In my opinion, this is the closest place to getting authentic japan grade sushi in tdot! *disclaimer, I do need to go back to zen to compare to make sure*   My boyfriend and I tried the prix fixed menu for $77 each person. We were both satisfied after the meal. I was full, but he still needed some snacks.   We had a sashimi platter with amazing grade A sashimi. The tuna sashimi really tasted like the one I had in Tokyo over the summer. The lobster soup was amazing. You can taste the lobster and it wasn't too salty. For the appetizer, we got a black cod fish. This was so good. Moist and full of flavor. The sushi was my fave! The chef already put soya sauce on the sushi (like they do in japan). They were all sooo delicious. I loved the uni! My ultimate fave! Dessert was an assortment of green tea things. Loved it!  The service was a bit slow at the start, but my tea and water glasses were never empty.  My server was from japan and she was so adorable!   Next time if I come, I would try omakase or order rolls and sashimi a la carte. The fixed was a good sampler, but I know what I want when I go back! For $77 a person, I think I can get more cool rolls and sushi, which may be more filling for my bf too!!!"}
{"text":"Great sushi restaurant. I went here last night with a group of people and it was such a nice place to be. From the moment we arrived we were greeted warmly and seated right away. The ambience is modern and clean. The service was excellent. Everyone was so nice and always ready to answer your questions. There were several special requests in our party due to food sensitivities and preferences and they accomodated all of our needs without any problem. We all had the tasting menu. It was a wonderful selection of expertly prepared plates. The sashimi was delicious. My favourite course was the gindara. It was cooked to perfection and the flavour was amazing. The sushi was fresh and beautifully presented and the desserts were the perfect finish to this lovely meal. Just a taste and not too sweet. Perfect in every way. I'd love to go back again."}
{"text":"This is by far my favourite sushi restaurant in all of Toronto. It's a bit pricy but totally worth it. The sushi is so fresh. I'd highly recommend making reservations, otherwise you might have to wait a while or eat at the bar. Sometimes it's a little difficult to understand what the waiters are saying because they have heavy Japanese accents.  My personal favourites:  aburi ...chef's choice of 4 nigiri, 3 oshizushi ... $27 -blowtorched, the sushi just melts in your mouth. You must eat these in the order it's presented on the plate!   aburicious ...2 ebi, 2 saba, 2 salmon, 2 JaBistroll ... $20 -a cheaper alternative to the aburi. You still get the blowtorched goodness, and a plus is you get to try their signature JaBistroll too  JaBistroll ...salmon, snow crab, uni, cucumber, tobiko ... $22 -this is their signature maki, also blow-torched. The entire roll is covered with tobiko, it's amazing!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in Toronto (Fin Izakaya comes in second.)  The blowtorched rolls were UNREAL. Would recommend the jabistroll.   Miso lobster soup was also great. I didn't know regular miso soup needed anything else until I tasted it.   Sashimi platter was awesome - very fresh. Scallops were out of this world.   Overall 10/10. Wait staff were very nice and have great recommendations."}
{"text":"I recommend you should make a reservation if you decide to go here with a group more than 4people. The experience I had here is amazing. The most fresh lobster platter I've ever tried. Even though the food options are decent, JaBistro has lots selections for drinks. Classic environment."}
{"text":"Excellent, fancy, pricey sushi. Come here for the vibes and also the fresh sashimi and torched sushi. We had the nama which is a few selection of classic nigiri which was so tasty. We also tried a few of the blowtorched ones in the form of aburicious, which comes with 2 ebi, 2 salmon, 2 saba and the JaBistroll. If you want to try a variety, I think this is definitely a good deal for $20. It's great for a special occasion and make sure you make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I had in the GTA, and good value, but they are only open for dinner during weekend which is a shame, because I will eat there more often if it was open for lunch on weekend. I had lobster miso soup, It was really good, and their sashimi and oishii sushi its fresh and melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by Toronto natives so I thought it was worth trying while I was in town.   A couple of factors: we came an hour before they closed (Yelp is wrong here - they close at 10:30, not 11) and didn't make a reservation. We also came with pretty high expectations.   The experience: Because we went later and on a Tuesday, it wasn't crowded at all - it was only us and another couple. And perhaps because it was closing time, it wasn't the best service ever. Even when we asked for recommendations, they didn't try too hard.   The food: Expect different. Not your standard sushi restaurant where there's a list of rolls. They have a lot of specialties, but a limited menu (there were more drinks on the menu than food).   We tried the lobster sashimi platter and it was pretty good quality and great presentation. But because we couldn't understand the waiter, we really had no idea what we were eating. We also got the scallops and tiger shrimp. Verdict, scallops were well cooked, but the tempura veggies were soaked which took away from the dish. The tiger shrimp (fried tempura shrimp) was decent at best and not too flavorful.   Overall, it was decent, but for the price and it being in downtown Toronto, I expected far better."}
{"text":"Last sat. I went to jabistro. We made reservation for 6:30 we arrived 15m early but we still had to wait almost 25m for table. OK its fine .  The first problem I had was we ordered three dishes. The aburicious rolls, sashimi platter and sushi. We were first served the aburicious rolls, but I felt like they should've served the sashimi platter first because the aburicious had more of a heavy flavour if that males sense. And the sashimi is more light and fresh. So because of the heavy flavour, it killed the taste of the sashimi.  Secondly, the sashimi was presented on slices of cucumber which had a strong cucumber taste and smell. And lastly, one of the sashimi I had..which was the shrimp ..wasn't fresh. I almost wanted to throw up.   All in all, I'm not saying I had a bad experience. I enjoyed the aburicious rolls, most of the sashimi and sushi. And they even have otoro which is tuna belly, not a lot of restaurants have it. Also, you might think I'm being super picky, but I heard all the chef are Japanese so I would've thought they would know the basics.. Like preparing the lighter foods first, and then heavy food after."}
{"text":"On a weekend visit to Toronto, we asked where we could find the best sushi and multiple people directed us to JaBistro. We were definitely lead in the right direction.  We made a reservation and were seated immediately even though the place was pretty packed - impressive. Our waiter asked us if we needed anything explained, rather than assuming, which I always think is great hospitality. I ordered the sushi aburi (blowtorched) and the rest of my group ordered the salmon sushi - absolutely mindblowing! It literally melts right in your mouth and was by far one of the best pieces of sushi I've ever had.  I made the mistake of thinking I had room for dessert and ordered the green tea creme brulee with matcha ice cream; unfortunately I had NO room but wish I did because it was delicious. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Fancy Japanese food, the quality of the food is really good, especially the sushi, but it is an expensive place and portion is small for guys."}
{"text":"Yep. This place has no weakness. Superb across the board. Sashimi varied, fresh and tasty +++. Saki spot on. Ambience and service subtle but top of the pack. This visit gained the 5 because of the especially genuine, attentive service to augment the consistently spectacular food."}
{"text":"Ja Bistro provides diners with a wonderful dinning experience and food to match! We entered into the restaurant and were greeted and seated quickly. They took our jackets and allowed us to choose a seat as it was fairly early in the evening. The lobster bisque miso was delicious and a great way to start the meal. We also ordered various plates of sashimi and sushi. Their sushi pieces had more rice than expected however tasted delicious none the less. I loved how they charred the outside of the fish to give it added flavour. Their sashimi was fresh and portions were generous. Our waiter checked on us throughout our meal and even provided a lovely thank you on the receipt. Overall, a wonderful dinning experience."}
{"text":"This is the perfect sushi experience for a special occasion! It was hard to understand our waitress at times but great overall atmosphere. Be prepared to spend some $$$ but it's definitely worth the price.   DRINKS: Mango Explosion Cocktail - fresh mango smoothie texture with a slight alcoholic aftertaste (great for those who like sweeter drinks). Asahi Super Dry - BIG bottle, light beer with a dry aftertaste (perfect for cleansing the palate in between bites)  MAINS: Sashimi Sampler - great value for 10-12 pieces of the freshest cuts of fish in Toronto. Hotate (scallop) Aburi & Aburicious (aburi sampler) - MUST TRY!!! 2 pieces of each type of sushi from the torched box sushi section (highly recommend if you can't decide on one specific type. Last but not least - Gindara (black cod w/house tartar sauce) Best piece of cod I've ever had! Perfect hot main if you're looking for a cooked fish dish.   DESSERT: Matcha Creme Br√ªl√©e - MUST TRY! If you love matcha desserts, this is for you! It even got the \"best dessert I've ever had\" ratings  from the green tea loving boyfriend who doesn't even usually like desserts!"}
{"text":"Excellent, quick service and delectable fresh sashimi. We had the sashimi sampler and one of the salads topped with crab and salmon. We also ordered the rose and the flavored sake which reminded of one of my most favorite drinks, a margarita. The sashimi came with edible fish bones, a first for me! All were pleasantly presented."}
{"text":"JaBistro, in my opinion is highly underrated. The food is fresh, authentic, flavorful, and the portions are abundant for the price (specifically the sashimi platters) I have been to a few omakase style Japanese restaurants who charge over over $200US for a tasting menu, while JaBistro offers equal (and often better) quality dishes at half the price. O ya in NY and Boston is supposed to be one of the best Japanese Omakase restaurants, and to be honest, thought the food was good, i paid over $500 for a meal comparable to a $150 meal here. JaBistro is definitely my go to for authentic Japanese in Toronto."}
{"text":"I brought my parents here for my mom's birthday, and everything was great! My mom is pretty picky when it comes to eating out. We had the large lobster platter, kyukyoku sashimi and aburi combo, and Hokkaido salad, and my parents couldn't be happier to have good sushi and sashimi with flavours and taste closest to home. My parents were really impressed saying that they didn't think they can come across sushi and sashimi like this in Canada. Although the price is a little on expensive side, I knew what I was getting myself into, and it made my parents super happy so it was definitely worth it. Everyone was polite and gave us service in Japanese, because my parents doesn't really speak English. Overall, everything was fantastic. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Had a dinner reservation for 3 people and cost abt $400.  It's not so steep consider that we tried 4 different warm sake (each 10oz) and had the biggest lobster sashimi which was a MUST.  Out of everything we had, my fav is actually the cheapest thing we ordered - Pressed cured Salmon sushi. Had it before in Minami in Vancouver before and loved it, I've been searching for it in Toronto ever since. Honestly I have to say it was almost as good. Salmon was cured beautifully with the blowtorch and the only thing was that the jalape√±o on top was not spicy enough (or probably was because every piece was cut in half. Still it would be my No.1 for the whole meal. Worth going, definitely the best modern Japanese cuisine in town.  Good Job Ja Bistro!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the Guu restaurants. Ja Bistro is higher end, definitely not cheap but you can tell that there is a difference between the quality of this place and Guu's (not that Guu isn't good). Its atmosphere is not super elegant but it's prettier and you'll see lots of suits.   The sashimi platter is served so beautifully it looks like a sculpture. If you sit by the bar you can see the sushi chefs placing each piece of fish like they're creating something. They're amazing! The fish is super fresh, the duck with cold soba is good and the beef tartare is great too. I also had the battered chicken and it was so, so crispy. My favourite dessert was the matcha brownie. It's not that sweet and they serve it with green tea ice cream on top. It sounds like a lot of green tea but it's really not. I'll have it again for sure. The portions are not large so my boyfriend had to order a couple extra dishes. I think that is the only down side if you go very hungry.  The service is good. My waiter was taking long to bring my drink and the manager himself brought it to me and apologized without me ever having to mention it to him.  In general I had a good experience there and I will definitely go back to Ja Bistro. Oh, and reservations are a must!"}
{"text":"Yummmmy sushi~~~  I rarely  order anything from the menu. But when I do, it's usually the lobster platter carpaccio to start and a la carte sushi as my main.   Like Japan, this is the type of place where you can sit at the sushi bar and the chef will make you whatever you want, one at a time.  The employees are overly friendly. I once ordered an entire toro as a joke... And it was placed in front of me. (See picture)   This place gets really busy so make a reservation before you go!"}
{"text":"If only Yelp would do 1/2 stars because I would definitely give it a solid 4.5. It deserves more than just a 4!   I like to use the \"Worth It\" price point analogy to categorize my sushi restaurants. Jabistro would fall in the $$ or mid-tier/above average price range for Japanese restaurants in this city. It is not your everyday type of sushi joint, but it is definitely a fancier place to splurge on a night out or a place just to enjoy some premium quality sushi.   What I have come to appreciate is not only their food, but also the ambiance and service. It is a relatively smaller Japanese restaurant located in a prime location downtown. However, it is far from pretentious, unlike majority of the higher end restaurants in downtown core. It does give that nostalgic feeling of eating at a local sushi joint in Japan. Service is impeccable.   Their food has always been consistent, whether it be their nigiri sets or their cooked foods. We often go for the \"kyukyoko\", which is the 11-piece chef's selection of the day's freshest fish. It almost always comes with a piece of otoro, chutoro, toro, hamachi, lumberjack, rainbow trout and wagyu nigiri. They have previously served other pieces such as scallop, uni, squid and black cod. My absolute favourites are their black cod and the otoro nigiri. The wagyu is great but the quality of the cut is not as consistent as with their fish selection. Their aburi sushi is quite popular among customers as well.   Next is their special menu. Their grilled yellowtail collar is insanely flavourful and tasty. The collar is well seasoned with the skin perfectly charred and crisped. The meat is tender and juicy. It is perfect when served with soya sauce and daikon puree.   This really is a great place for high quality sushi. It is the place to be for all sushi enthusiasts!"}
{"text":"We came here for a birthday and it was great! They played a birthday song and gave us a dessert with our friends name on it. The food is good! I'd say its a bit pricey but I am from Vancouver originally so I always find sushi here expensive... The aburi sushi here is really good! :) The staff took the time to explain each thing on our plate."}
{"text":"Food: 5/5 Service: 5/5 Location: 3/5  Word on the street is that JaBistro is one of the best sushi spots in Toronto. It's quite high end (you might faint at the price per piece), but I would say it is definitely worth it if you want to splash out on a fancy dinner for a special occasion. But I've also had sushi of comparable quality for half the price.   We ordered the $50 sashimi platter that had 11 different pieces of nigiri. My favourite was the fatty tuna and the wagyu beef. The fish was fresh and delicious, but I was disappointed at how poorly the sushi held together. Every time I went to pick up a piece it would fall apart before I could even get it on to my plate. On the other hand, they did blow me away with their blow torched sushi (Sushi-aburi). We ordered the $20 aburicious that had 2 each of ebi, saba, salmon, and JaBistroll. The aburi sushi has a very unique modern look to them since they are squared off. The blowtorched finish adds a smoky flavour and caramelized sweetness to the fish that I am obsessed with.    The d√©cor is clean and chic, with a sushi bar on one side and tables on the other. My only gripe is that the restaurant is quite narrow so you are seated very closely to adjacent tables - a bit too close since I could hear the conversations going on around me all too clearly. Fun for people watching, but not great for a private conversation."}
{"text":"Casual modern Japanese with a great atmosphere.  The dishes were elegant and some were really creative (the flavoured, pressed, torched sushi - though it was a little heavy on the rice).  The calamari was the only miss.  Despite the great flavour, it felt very similar to what you could get in a chain restaurant  There was also a great sake list - the bar tender was really knowledgable and able to point us to a great bottle."}
{"text":"Went here for our anniversary and this is immediately our go-to recommended Japanese restaurant now!  The beautiful PLATTER OF SASHIMI ($100) was what we were most excited for! $100 may seem like a hefty price to pay for sashimi, but the value and quality was impeccable and incomparable. They have a smaller $50 platter. The difference between the $50 and the $100 one is not in quantity but in quality. Without a doubt, this was our favorite of the evening and we recommend this if you are looking to dine at JaBistro.  (As a side note, if you have a large party, you can call in advance and create a customized platter to fit your preferences.)  We also ordered the ABURI BLOWTORCHED SUSHI ($27) and JABISTROLL ($22)  Each ABURI SUSHI piece was smokey and each had a very unique taste. Our favourite (by a landslide) was the salmon aburi that had salmon at the top but also a thin layer of salmon in the center of the rice, topped with a few fresh slices of jalapeno pepper on top. It literally MELTS in your mouth  The JABISTROLL ($22) consisted of salmon, snow crab, uni, cucumber and tobiko. The sacred roll of Jabistro! The charred fish on top gave it a slight smokey flavor but did not mask the sharp flavours of uni and snowcrab. We would actually consider this a very creamy roll and oddly enough, we really enjoyed it!  We each got one LOBSTER MISO SOUP which comes with the sashimi platter. Oh my goodness, this was such a sweet and light soup and a good break in the meal. The miso did not over power the lobster flavour and the giant lobster claw was a great addition too :)  Just a note about their service: We had made an online reservation earlier in the week and added that it was our anniversary. We were going to order dessert but honestly, we were FILLED to the brim with delicious food. They brought out this little platter to wish us a happy anniversary. Small touches like this always make a restaurant stick out :)   JaBistro is not cheap, but as far as we know the quality is unparalleled to anything we have ever eaten (we have not been to Kaji yet) and no, you will not leave hungry.  The service was absolutely amazing - all the servers were very well informed about anything on the platter and were very attentive. Each time we got up from our seat, someone would come over and refold our napkins. Our plates were changed after every dish and our glass was never empty because someone was always refilling our water. The table is cleared after every dish to prepare for the next.  We wouldn't recommend the omakase there, we noticed other people ordered it and yes, you do get a full meal in terms of appetizer + main + dessert but that's it. It looked very underwhelming in comparison to the main menu. Of course, we can only speak from what we observed but it just didn't seem worth it. But then again, if you are on a tight budget then omakase is a small peek into what JaBistro has to offer.  Despite the pricey dinner, we would love to go again... I will be dreaming of this meal for days ! We highly, highly recommend this to any Japanese food-lover, it was arguably one of the best meals we've ever had. Thank you, JaBistro!!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here for quite a while and I am so glad I finally did!   I made reservations ahead of time and I'm really glad I did because even though it was somewhat empty when I got in, soon enough it filled up real fast. The restaurant was smaller than I had thought because there is literally only one row of tables and a bar area. I actually really liked the layout of the place. The servers were also nice and I liked how the server we got was knowledgable and made recommendations for us.   We ended up getting: - lobster miso soup: not worth it, tastes just like fish broth and nothing more  - abrui: so so good. Some of the pieces weren't as good as the others but I would say majority was really good. The sushi literally melted in your mouth. The fish was all so fresh too.  - ochamame: very mediocre, would not order again. It was cold edamame and although I do agree you can taste the green tea infused in it very distinctly, it honestly was not anything special. The cold part really threw me off cause most places I've had it was lukewarm at least.  - Hokkaido salad: my friend got this one which she said was okay.   Overall, I would come here for the blow torched sushi because that's what they're known for, but I would not waste my money on their other items. I will definitely be coming here again soon to try the other sushi flavours!"}
{"text":"Have always raved about the fact that this has been one of my favorite restaurants ever since it open its doors here in Toronto. Even on a Tuesday night, it was a full house. Thankfully we made reservations in advance. Ordered the lobster sashimi platter - realized that the portion feels a little smaller than the last time I ordered it (about a year ago) but maybe prices went up?? (Not sure)   From the first time that I stepped foot into that place till now, I felt that the service standard has dropped. The waitress that greeted us when we walked in just guided us to our seats (previously they used to coat check our coats). When the other guests beside us arrived, they were all asked if they would like their coats checked!!   When our server came by our table, she asked what we wanted to order politely and we placed our orders. The same guests beside us was greeted with a smile and an introduction to herself and an option to try some sample sake. Was just thrown off on the difference in attitude and Almost felt like it's because we were of a minority.   Regardless of that fact, we still left a good tip assuming that it was a busy night + the food was still on point. Still love the food. A good recommendation for their staff is to train their servers to treat all customers the same way and at a minimum, not allow their customers hear how they are being treated differently."}
{"text":"A bit pricy but the food is good and the drinks are awesome. This is more like a \"Guy\" place where you have drinks for good chats but not really a dinner place to get full."}
{"text":"OMG! I don't know what to say. I've been to japan 10 times and I'm very picky about sushi, but this is so far the only sushi place I would keep coming back. Every single sushi is a new experience, every single piece is a piece of art on your tongue. The flavours are just so well blended, and the texture of the fish is just so tender, even take, which usually taste like rubber in other restaurants.  The food here almost brought me to tears the first time I came here.  Heavenly, I would say."}
{"text":"Got to finally try this place! After many many years of passing by it, finally the trigger and gave a try. Heard many good things about this place. Also heard they make a pretty good aburi sushi as well. (well that's up to me to decide =P)   The interior is very nice and modern. Long sushi table where customers can watch the sushi chefs cut up the fish and there is a decent number of tables along the wall. Surprisingly, the restaurant is very deep once you walk inside. It's not very big but its long which was interesting.   Most of my orders were the aburi's (duh). I had ordered the Aburi, Salmon oshi sushi and aburicious. Yes lots of aburis. Once placed the order in about 10 mins it was on my table! What what?! So quick?!   After trying all the pieces the nigiri's oshi sushi were all so good! Some of the sushi's were tastes like butter good. The fish was outstanding and I liked that they didn't overload the aburi with too much rice either.   Really nice place to come for a dinner once in awhile for a special occasion and enjoy some really good expensive sushi. Pretty good place for aburi's in Toronto."}
{"text":"So, I came here spoiled by a recent trip in Japan and that may very well be the only reason this place did not get a fifth star. The nigiri I had were delicious, rice was very well prepared. Easily one of the top-10 sushi places I tried outside of Japan and throughout the world.  So where did the 5th star go? In the miso soup with lobster, which was not terribly Japanese in style. In the green tea served. In some elements of the service.  I thought a while about this. Yelp, we need a 4.5 vote sooner or later."}
{"text":"What a refreshing twist on standard sushi.  All the pieces are engineered in an artistic way and blow torched for a light char taste.  It is a bit expensive, but well worth it for a splurge sushi meal.  You will not find anything like it in Toronto.  Great drinks as well."}
{"text":"Whoa, best sushi in Toronto by a very far distance from everything else. I'm not even sure I could name another place with comparable quality. I went here with a buddy last night to try their prix fixe...very 'bromantic', I know.  We thought after the first plate (which had four things on it: sashimi, panko crusted black cod, duck salad, and salmon consomm√© --- I have a shellfish allergy, so i got duck salad instead of some soft shell crab dish and a lobster consomm√©), we thought we could probably add a platter of sashimi atop the tasting menu, so we got that inserted into our meal. Wow, it was amazing. Oh yeah, the panko crusted black cod was great too!! The rest of our tasting menu consisted of sushi, 3 pieces of which were blowtorched...eat those last! You'll want to savour them. And dessert was great too...not sure it was very japanese, but it was great none the less. Service was nice and friendly.  Overall, I would definitely come back here again. The platter we ordered was great, but we didn't really need it with the tasting menu. We were hungry and eager to eat as much as we could, I guess. But ultimately, I think the prix fixe by itself is a nice sufficient meal on its own. I don't know which I would chose between though...prix fixe or large platter? Roughly the same price...both equally good.  I've heard prior to coming that maybe the price point is a little too high here. I would have to disagree after the meal. I thought it was right on. Yum!"}
{"text":"Salmon Ohshizushi is amazing. It's a fusion dish with salmon, cheese and a thin slice of jalape√±o. Shashimi. is fresh"}
{"text":"Delicious lunch today at JaBistro. Excellent food and service, beautiful restaurant. It was a treat to sit at the sushi bar and watch and smell.  We shared: Kyukyoku - on special for $45 instead of $55 (yay!but then we realized it only had nine pieces not the twelve shown in many pictures here). This was the Star of the show. Mmm Aburicious - a nice sampler platter with two each of the torched sushi. My favourite piece was the jabistroll Salmon oshizushi - torched salmon sushi was so yummy  I took off a star because of the lack of accessibility. I did not see an accessible washroom, the individual doors to enter the washrooms were narrower than standard and it required two hands to open the awkward door back into the restaurant."}
{"text":"It's my second time came here, really good taste and nice environment.  I love the lobster platter most, very fresh sashimi. You can't miss it."}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service  Yup, everything about this place is true. Live it, breathe it, love it. This place takes sushi to a whole new level by adding the aburi style, they do it very well in that too.  JaBistro's decorations remind me of Guu/Kinka (makes sense, it's the same organization umbrella), although this place is a lot less noisy. Reservations are virtually required at all times, although I got extremely lucky that there was an area of 3 leaving as I arrived, so I was able to snatch that area.  We ordered the miso soup with lobster, JaBistroll, sashimi carpaccio, mirugai sushi, wagyu oshizushi, and the aburi platter. I really wanted to order off the menu, but I wasn't knowledgeable enough to know what's offered beyond the menu.  Honestly, everything was excellent except the miso soup with lobster. The JaBistroll was torched very nicely and tasted very good as well. The sashimi carpaccio had a nice Italian twist to it, although I probably won't order it again. The mirugai (geoduck clam) sushi was very unique and of a large size too. The wagyu oshizushi was probably the highlight of the meal; so good that we ordered two of them at the end! The aburi platter featured torched scallop, sea bream, salmon, otoro, tiger shrimp, and mackerel; the tiger shrimp and mackerel weren't too spectacular, but the scallop, sea bream, salmon, and otoro more than made it up for this dish. Finally, the miso soup with lobster had a bland taste to it, and the lobster didn't really contribute much to the taste.  Service was excellent, and I couldn't have asked for more. The aburi dish initially didn't arrive, but the waitress I had noticed each time and assured we would get the dish as soon as possible. It took a while, but it eventually arrived and she profusely apologized for it. I had to tell her that it's fine and these things happen. Nonetheless, if I'm nearby with friends and looking for a sushi dinner spot, this place would definitely be one of the first in my mind."}
{"text":"I have been there several times before, and the food has always been great. However, the service this time was terrible. We were asked five times in ten minutes if we want to order anything else or the bill when we were talking about the menu. It's like the server was trying to make us leave. We were so upset and left the restaurant in fifty minutes. Terrible terrible experience."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant once with just my husband and then another time with our 4 year old. Had a great dining experience both times and the little one loved it.  Their sushi and blowtorched pieces melt in your mouth. I loved all the pieces I was given minus the Japanese sardine but that is just because I prefer more mild tastes.  I had the miso lobster soup to start and it was delicious.  We also got the sea bream collar and it was simple and perfectly cooked.  Very satisfying meal, great staff and atmosphere and kid friendly. Worth a try if you like Japanese cuisine:)"}
{"text":"JaBistro is an authentic Japanese restaurant with fresh ingredients.  Service was great.  Staff seem to be knowledgeable about their food and they explain it all whenever they serve it.  Small but cozy restaurant so you'll need to make reservations ahead of time.  Aburi/Pressed/Torched was great--but IMO I don't think it was the best I've had in downtown Toronto. Their menu is limited but they focus more on fresh fish. I wasn't a huge fan of their soy sauce as I found it to be a bit too sweet. They give you two different kinds. They have an extensive sake list as well. All in all, it's a great restaurant for a special occasion and to try really fresh sushi, but it does come with a hefty price tag if you want to feel satiated."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi bar, conveniently located and awesome service makes Ja Bistro a must visit for me. Pricey but worth it!  My favorite were the JaBistro roll and salmon oshizushi (aburi). Both were torched and literally melted in my mouth. Similar to the rolls at Miku, definitely a taste to reminisce.  We also had the sashimi platter which was super fresh and full of variety. I personally found it better value for money to order the special Aburi rolls as they are unique and while the sashimi was fresh, it wasn't as unique.  The service was too notch with our server regularly checking up on us, topping up our waters and explaining the menu and dishes to us.  Overall, I'd recommend trying if you're looking for some top notch sushi in the city."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try JaBistro since it's supposedly offers one of the best Japanese cuisine in the city.    ...So excited that I starved for 3 hours after work to make it to a 9pm reservation on a Friday night.  This is not normal for someone who eats every 2 hours.    Anyhow, the waitresses were very pleasant at the door and helped us take off our coats, etc. Our waiter, however friendly, confused our order a little bit and resulted in a 30min wait between our first dish and latter two.  It's okay, I think the man just needed more sleep ):  We didn't get the prix fixe and tried their regular menu.  We got the sashimi sampler to start.. not going to try naming the fishies because I only really remember our friend salmon and tuna.  I do recall the mackerel being salty, however.  The bluefin toro was to die for, though... along with the scallop, both melted in my mouth.   Can I haz everyday.  We also got two types of oshizushi.  Doesn't the name sound cute?  It's basically pressed sushi where a wooden mold is used to shape it into a block.  Raw fish is never used and the ingredients are either cooked or cured.  The one we got was the aburicious; we had two of each oshizushi - ebi, saba, salmon, and JaBistro roll.  I devoured ALL of them and if you come here you must get it.  That's all I have to say about that.  It's also a good dish to have if you're dining with one other person, because the aburi has 4 of the nigiri and 3 of oshizushi, which is harder to share among two people.  The last dish we tried was the wagyu oshizushi.  I was okay with this one, since I was so impressed by the aburicious this one barely lived up to it.  I think I like wagyu beef by itself and not in sushi.. but still didn't regret getting it.  While this is on the pricier end, it's definitely worth a visit (or two.. or ten..) for the average foodie.  I would come back again to try more items on the menu and have a drink or two :)"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of sushi and Japanese food in general. And to top it off, I do believe a space makes a restaurant. And this place does have its ambiance.  It's so welcoming.    You walk in and it's small and intimate and wonderfully low lit.  Perfect for a date.... so on this alone... 5 stars... and then the $$$$$$$$.  This place should be 4 or 5 Money notes. Not 3. And not because of the price. I am a big supporter on paying for top dollar material. The food was good but not worth $90 for 2 people for a hand roll, miso soup and 8 pieces of sushi...   Go for sure!  But expect to leave hungry or spend the equivalent of a trip to NYC (and I'd rather take a visit to little Japan on st marks)"}
{"text":"I had alot of hype for jabistro and I was seriously dissappointed. We ordered the lobster sashimi platter and it was ridiculously expensive for a couple pics of sashimi pieces the bill was 90 dollars. Yes I admit the quality of fish is way better than other restaurants but going here often people for sure will become bankrupt"}
{"text":"A modern yet simple japanese restaurant without your typical japanese deco hanging off the walls...waiter and waitress are dressed in a simple black attire with a apron...it's not a really huge place so I suggest getting reservations for big parties of 6 or more...the menu is very simple with either sushi/sashimi platters, assorted sushi rolls....not ur typical rolls tho, they r square shaped and taste amazingggggg, in addition they have a few grilled things and a variety of sakis  The 2 of us decided to get the lobster sashimi platter which has salmon, bluefish tuna, toro, scallop, monk fish (yuck), salmon roe, 1 lobster tail and 2 more other things I forgot....very fresh sashimi, prolly the best sashimi I had in toronto, it was my first time trying lobster sashimi and it wasn't bad, not at all fishy or salty, kind of creamy actually  In addition we got the assorted sushi which came with 8 piece with 4 different kinds, I think there was tiger shrimp, altantic salmon, their signature roll and forgot the last one. Best option if you wanna try most of their rolls and if you like a specific one, u could order more  In the end we opted for the green tea tiramisu which was to die for if you like green tea, just see the pics urself"}
{"text":"I stopped by today and had some take out to go, Aburicious and JaBisyroll. I'm really not fan of MAYO and I sensed it would be  perfect if they made those rolls sans MAYO."}
{"text":"Lobster sashimi!! Great restaurant. Never disappoints. Pricey so come for special occasion or expensive girlfriend."}
{"text":"I love the toro (fatty tuna) sashimi~ love their sushi, love everything in jabistro one of my fav rest. Their sashimi taste better and more fresh than sushi kaji! Unbelievable !"}
{"text":"What a beautiful wooden patio!  It has the feel of being inside a sauna and the bathroom connected to the patio carried the same theme.  It was a perfect late summer patio dinner with a girlfriend.  The sushi was fancy and delicious, the drinks were refreshing.  It was a perfect chick outing.  And I use this term because I think the food that they serve is chick food.  What's chick food?  Well, when I used to work in the cosmetic industry and there was a training or event they would always order us \"chick food\".  \"Chick food\" is food in dainty little portions, colourful, cute, has a little bit of a spin on it, and looks quite healthy.  Ja Bistro food is exactly that, and they nail it!  Every single bite is interestingly delicious and fresh."}
{"text":"Honestly, this place deserves a 5 Stars for service.   As for the food, it's good with a few hits and misses.  Appetizer:  Snack Platter - $-8:  2 Oysters and Fish Foie Gras - not too bad, presentation was beautiful. Salad - $7:  overpriced for a few cucumber slices and lettuce on the bottom - maybe if they used spring mixed greens or arugula, it would have been worth the price).  Main:  Sashima Platter $50 + $15 (Lobster & Miso Soup):   The Sashimi platter was beautifully decorated.   It was fresh and good, but just a tad bit overpriced for the selections.   Decided to add the lobster sashimi in there.  I am so glad I did because or else, I never knew that raw lobster tasted soooo good.   Nice miso soup with a cooked lobster claw to complete the meal.  Of course, for what we are paying, I just wished that someone would shuck the lobster claw \"meat\" out and lay it nicely in the soup.  (Made a suggestion to the chef for that because we really didn't have any tools to eat the claw).  We also ordered the Sushi aburi - $27 - blowtorched sushi.  Very good and beautifully done!   I think this dish really says their name as a \"bistro\" type of sushi restaurant.  Loved their \"block\" style rice sushi.    Dessert:  Complimentary (made in house) - Ginger truffles.  Yum!  If you wanted to me to sum up my dinner experience here, it would be:  two-thumbs up for the fish foie gras (my fav! and I don't even like foie gras: chicken or duck, but the fish version was gooooood.) and the complimentary truffles were a nice touch; instead of the \"ice cream\" they normally serve at the other sushi restaurants.   Decor was cozy and our waitress was amazing - phenomenal service!  Even though it is overpriced, I don't mind splurging for good service and good food."}
{"text":"My boyfriend surprised me by treating me to dinner at Ja Bistro since he knew that I've been dying to go!  We ordered the sashimi sampler ($30), JaBistroll - salmon, snow crab, uni, cucumber, tobiko ($12) and agedashi - deep fried b.c. oysters, seasonal veggies, kombu dashi ($12). The first two dishes came really quick but the last dish took a while (probably because some frying was needed).  Our favourite was the JaBistroll. It was very creamy and flavourful. If I were to come to back to this restaurant, I would definitely order this roll. The sashimi sampler was a hit and miss for me. All of the sashimi was definitely fresh. However, some were full of flavour and some were just bland. It was a nice, little sampler though. Lastly was the deep fried oysters. I would say that this dish was somewhere in the middle for me. There were 3-4 pieces of oysters which was nice. I personally didn't like deep fried things submerged in liquid but I decided to try something different by ordering this dish. The kombu dashi itself was full of flavour.  If there's one thing you must get at this restaurant, it's definitely the JaBistroll!"}
{"text":"Came here first time eat-out in Toronto. High quality but not traditional Japanese restaurant. All tables were full and crowded. Our server was very friendly but very busy! Food was good and beautiful."}
{"text":"Ja Bistro has been my favourite sushi place in Toronto for a while now. It's on the pricey side, but you can never, ever, go wrong if you choose to dine there - they're consistently great - not simply good - every single visit. I just wish my wallet was consistently more filled with money so I could afford visiting them more often than I do.   From the moment you do your reservation - they ask for food restrictions, allergies, confirm if it's some special occasion - to the moment your food is served and, if that's the case, paired with sake, everything is done to make you feel special. The ambiance is intimate and I'll suggest sitting at the sushi bar so you can watch the food preparation and interact with the chef. The drinks are also great.   It's a wonderful restaurant, one of my favourites."}
{"text":"I love the sushi platter. It's not only fresh but also beautiful. Moreover, the restaurant is very considerate. There were 5 of us and the sushi platter was designed by 5 ppl. Love it! No need to fight for food or feel unfair to anyone.   Highly recommend their blowtorched sushi too. Love the mackerel and shrimp ones.  Here's the blog (but it's in Mandarin Chinese). Welcome to check the photos here. http://lizzieh.pixnet.net/blog/post/265853339"}
{"text":"This is THE PLACE to have sushi/japanese food in Toronto. We also tried Miku which has similar menu but Jabistro is the best in town! Love the lobster miso soup and the alburi sushi!"}
{"text":"There are two items I come here for - Jabistroll and salmon oshizushi. Cannot compare to the oshizushi from Vancouver's Miku, but it gives me my fix. The salmon oshisuzhi is quite oily but the flavour is delicious. The Jabistroll I feel is consistently overtorched. I want to taste uni rather than burn. Maybe because it is not in season, but there was hardly any uni in the roll I had most recently, and the overtorching doesn't help to bring out the delicate flavour - I felt like I was eating something like a charred california roll."}
{"text":"You can see the reviews for Ja Bistro are the extreme ends of the scale. Love it or hate it. I think I understand the sentiments.  Firstly, JaBistro is not a labour of love. This is not a sushi purists owner/operator serving up great sushi to delight himself and his customers. This is the ubiquitous Korean businessman operating a Japanese restaurant, as part of a chain, to make money... However, very much like Nami  AjiSai etc. there is an effort to hire and present a Japanese face to customers. So, most of the waitstaff are Japanese and also the chefs were Japanese.   Service: was very good. The lady who took the reservation on the phone asked if it is a special occasion and explained where we would be sitting. They were welcoming, explained the menu, answered questions and refilled our glasses politely. They asked if we have any allergy. They were not pushy either. Great service and staff.  The sushi was very very good. Maybe not quite Yasu good, but very good. There is an emphasis on oshizushi (pressed Osaka style) and Aburi (blowtorched) and definitely the nigiri was good. They do not use real wasabi however. The price, however, is expensive and you do pay for the quality. The menu is limited. It is not limited like Yasu which only offers omakase, but its a far cry from a Japanese restaurant with choices, cooked food, etc.  The d√©cor is modern and clean with dimmed lights. What I do not like, and this is a strictly personal preference, is their counter does not allow you to really see the chefs at work unless you stretch yourself (reminds one of Miku) and does not have a refrigerator with the fish. I actually like the feel of the traditional sushi bar with the fridged fish.   The washroom was clean and the clienetele is mostly the standard Chinese-Canadian folk who swarm around anything Japanese...   Toronto area is lucky to have high-end sushi like Ginko, Hiro, Yasu, Aoyama, Zen, Inaho, Miyabi, Kaji, Mye and more. JaBistro is very good too if you could get over the nagging subjective issues."}
{"text":"I took my aunt here for a birthday lunch because she loves sushi but, usually only eats at low-end and mid-range neighbourhood type spots. We were both incredibly impressed! Decor is minimal but stylish all in neutrals, the low back chairs don't look very comfortable but my aunt had no complaints. Quiet music in the background with a business like atmosphere. Our server was very sweet, always with a smile and very helpful with suggestions being that it was our first time. She gave a great explanation of each piece of sushi when it was delivered to the table. With so many different types we often forgot what she had said by the time we were eating it. Some way to be able to remind you of which pieces were which would be nice.  Finally the sushi! It was flawless! I had a bowl of miso soup with LOBSTER in it! Soooooo delicious! We had a sashimi platter and 'aburicious' which is a selection of the blowtorched sushi Jabistro is known for. Every bite was pure pleasure, incredibly fresh with an interesting variety of cuts that you wouldn't necessarily see at your neighbourhood joint. My aunts favourite was the torched wagyu sashimi which she said she could have eaten a whole plate of. I can't even pick a favourite, each piece was impeccable in its own way. We were both full by the end but, I certainly left wishing I could have eaten so much more! I would definitely return and I would recommend it to friends who were looking for a more upscale sushi experience that isn't a total bank-breaker."}
{"text":"Came here to check out the renovated patio - which I actually didn't even know it exist. The patio is beautifully designed with its use of wood - gave this zen ambiance to the place. Seats on the patio are first come first serve, no reservations are allowed. As expected, service was impeccable  -sashimi sampler: ikura, Tai Sea Bream, Salmon, Wagyu, Chutoro everything was as fresh as could be. All three types of fish - chutoro; tai seabream; salmon were sweet and so buttery - especially the chutoro where it just melted in your mouth. The slight torch on the sea bream added a hint of smokiness and the ikura just popped as I chewed.  - appetizer plate: Ebi Nanban, Ika Karamari, Tai kama, miso soup Beautifully presented platter with a whole head of the sea bream. The lobster miso soup was packed with lobster essence, and the broth was clear and incredibly light. The ebi nanban (shrimp) and Ika Karamari (calamari) had a light breading with a tart sauce on the side. The tai kama - grilled sea bream was tender and mildly seasoned to showcase its natural flavor. I wasn't Asian enough so I didn't eat the fish eye lol..   -Sushi platter:Jabistroll, tiger shrimp, mackerel, salmon with jalapeno, lobster with ikura, chutoro, kanpachi/amberjack with yuzu Each of the pressed sushi were lightly seared with a blowtorch as well and each piece were topped with different toppings for a distinctive taste. The uni in the signature JaBistro Roll gave it a nice creaminess and the lightly torched mayo on top is simply an explosion of flavors.  -dessert: Vanilla ice cream, matcha mousse cake cake was delightful and well balanced with multiple layers of texture. The base was crunchy with bits of corn flakes on the side, while the mousse itself were incredible smooth. The ice cream had a hint of vanilla that was not too sweet either"}
{"text":"My first comment is contributed to this!!!! My forever love!!! I came here the first time was because of my boyfriend's birthday. He introduced this restaurant and  we decided to choose this restaurant as his birthday dinner place! The sashimi they served was the freshest raw fish I've ever tasted! And I'm hands down for my favourite sushi - aburi sushi!!! They were all barbecued  sushi rolls which tasted super good, and the taste could bring you into heaven. Their service is pretty good as well, as waitresses were being very patient to explain the menu to you and explain each dish when they were being served! They gave a big surprise at the end of the dinner!After ordered the dessert for Matcha Br√ªl√©e, they served us the br√ªl√©e with written words \"Happy Birthday!\" Oh wow I didn't know why they knew that day was my boyfriend's birthday cause we didn't tell them, but we both love this surprise!"}
{"text":"Whenever I want a chill and fun spot for quality sushi, I always come back to Jabistro. I've been back at least more than 5 times in the past couple months. I can't recommend this place enough.  Love the staple chef at the sushi bar for the kyukyoku too."}
{"text":"Pricey and the sushi was already prepared in boxes... I tasted fresher sushi with its competitors and better service.. Way too over hyped this place and I was disappointed.."}
{"text":"Last time I was here, I ordered from the tasting menu. This time, my wife decided to order from the regular menu. We were NOT disappointed. First of all, their service is still way above par, and they do things right. First, their serving portion is perfect; second, they rotate their menu according to what is fresh; and, three, they don't dump you with everything you've ordered. When sushi and sashimi leave the chef, it has a limited table live, and after that they loose taste. That's why there is this chef who will take your plate away if you take your time taking picture and talk and not eating. So, they timed all the dishes, so you only have one dish in front of you at any given time....except the soup, of course. The chefs treat every order like an art piece, so if you reserve ahead, sit at the sushi bar and watch the artists at work. You want authentic Japanese sushi and sashimi, AND don't want to pay $200/person for nothing, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"A good spot but not worth the hype or price. TLDR: about as good as you get in Toronto but coming up short with delivery. Close however. Warning, sushi is my jam so I talk out of my ass. Jiro dreams of sushi. I dream of jiro.   Taste: a step above standard but also a step below amazing. I am comparing jabistro to \"amazing\" places on the west coast and in Japan, which may sound a little douchbaggy but I went in with the expectation that this is one of the best spots in Toronto. In that way I am respecting it. I usually test places with their squid and mackerel (and miso) because those are two things that can taste horrible if old or incorrectly prepared. They were up to par but not great. I also tried their ala cart shrimp and prawn, which were sweet and satisfying, but a little pasty and left a little bit of a chalky aftertaste. Everything else in the meal was similar. Good but not great. The main thing I got from the experience is that everything in their control was done well. The torching didn't have a gas aftertaste. The rice was perfect. The grilled fish was actually beyond amazing. In fact the rice and grilled dish are why this place gets a 4 instead of a 3. The thing out of their control, the fish supply, is what separates this place from some of the best I had. Things just didn't taste as fresh and delicate.    Atmosphere: a little bright. Great staff. Place is awkwardly thin but that's a toronto real estate problem. Clean as f (Very important) and no bad smells.   Transportation. Take the subway or an uber. Super easy. Parking.... well downtown parking.   Value: my bill was a little over 300 bucks for 2 people with 2 5-course meals, tip, some wine, and a couple extra pieces. Didn't break the bank but I probably won't be back until after I've tried all the other spots in Toronto. Who knows, this place may be the best. Maybe I just don't know it yet.   Extra: the Hokkaido scallops were probably the best raw dish"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed with this restaurant. The torch rolls tasted burnt, sashimi selection on their platter wasn't that great, the cod was in a sauce that tasted like butter and milk. The only thing we kind of enjoyed was the fried Oysters. I have had memorable experience at some great sushi restaurants like Kaji and Zen but this restaurant shouldn't be in the same league. The best thing about this restaurant is the d√©cor and exceptional service."}
{"text":"Service is very good and the place is clean and well-decorated (are those leather tabletops?). They seem to insist on taking your jacket, which I found a bit awkward... I just gave it to them.  On to the food...  The sashimi platter is awesome and it comes with salty treats for you to munch on like fried fish scales, fried shrimp tails, and dried... fish stuff (I don't know what). If you're lucky you might even get a deep fried shrimp head, it reminds me of soft-shelled crab.  As much as I like the classic sushi, the blowtorched/pressed sushi ('aburi') is really the highlight for me - I'm not sure if there are other places in Toronto that offer something similar. I love the taste of fat, and the aburi pieces bring all the flavors out."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of traditional, high-end nigiri served omakase style. My review is geared towards like-minded diners.  Having dined at Yasu and Zen in the past week, I can say with confidence that this place is the best place for traditional nigiri - based purely on taste - in Toronto. Every piece in their omakase (called \"kyukyoku\") comes with a lingering and sublime umami (which is why we're eating this, right?)  Lobster miso soup is also excellent, have it.  Update: they provided me a yubifuki (finger cloth to wipe your fingers with after each piece - you _are_ eating with your hands, right?) after I requested one in my reservation notes. Love it."}
{"text":"Amazingly fresh sushi! A bit on the pricey side for the amount you get, but worth it if you go every once in a long while for a special occasion. I would definitely return, but not for awhile as it hurts the pocket! The sashimi here is melt-in-your-mouth, and every piece is to die for! Makes you want more!   Service is great as well, and the restaurant is very clean! A bit small, but it's intimate and great for a date!"}
{"text":"I've heard many good reviews about this sushi restaurant. Finally had a chance to try out this high end sushi restaurant! We came here on a Sunday night at around 9 for a friends birthday.   When we arrived the restaurant wasn't too packed. There were many tables open. The design of the restaurant was nice and simple. The lighting was nice. We can see the sushi bar where they blow torch and sliced the sashimi.   We came here purposely to try to lobster sashimi platter but they were sold out that night and only had lobster miso soup left. So instead we ordered the large sashimi platter. Additionally we added two orders of the salmon oshizushi, one order of the wagyu oshizushi and 6 ikura.   Large sashimi platter: ($100) the platter came with a few different fishes but We felt like the variety wasn't enough. The sashimi came on a flat platter. We were so excited in trying the sushi and when we first placed it in our mouths it was warm. The sashimi was warm and not chilled and didn't seem fresh. It felt like warm soggy bread. It was very disappointing, we were expecting it to be very fresh.  We had to ask the waiter to ask the chef to transfer the sashimi onto an ice bowl.   Salmon oshizushi: came with 6 pieces of torched salmon sushi. The sushi was pretty good, the torches sauce complements the sushi pretty well but it didn't blow me away. It was good but not the best. ($16)   Wagyu oshizushi: came with 6 pieces of sushi. The flavour of this sushi was very plain and the meat was really really thin ($24)   Ikura rolls: when tasting the ikura sushi, it was pretty good. Probably one of the best dishes of the day. It was cold and seemed pretty fresh. They were $6 each, expensive but they were good.    Dessert:  They only offered two different desserts so we decided to red wine pear and ice cream and corn flakes ($6). In my opinion the red wine pear was not good and I didn't like it.  It didn't taste good. The ice cream was okay but just a plain vanilla.    We came here for a birthday, they didn't give any birthday dessert for the birthday person. Only a plate with happy birthday written on it with chocolate.   Service: The service was not the best. I feel like it could have been way better for a high end restaurant. We had difficulties finding the waiter. When the waiter came to explain the platter, it was really difficult to understand because she had an accent and she spoke really fast. She didn't really try to explain anything.     I take one star off for the poor service, I take another off for the warm and unfresh sushi. Lastly, I take one more star off for them rushing everything, the impatient waitresses made us feel like we are not welcomed. For the price we pay, it is not as good as other Japanese restaurants like Miku, Fune and etc."}
{"text":"Outstanding. Brilliant. When I was on a business trip in Niagara on the lake and ate at Ki for sushi (great place too!) I mentioned to the waiter that I'd be in Toronto for the upcoming weekend, did he have any sushi suggestions there. He told me about this place. Spot on sir!"}
{"text":"In the upper category of the varying quality of sushi you can have in Toronto, this is a little bit of a gem in the city."}
{"text":"The sushi and sashimi was amazing!  But what really impressed me was the service!   We didn't make reservations for dinner on a Friday. The blowtorch sushi and sashimi platters are both beautiful and delicious."}
{"text":"Best green tea! Best sashimi platter! Abit pricy but super worth it! Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"love this place.  awesome blowtorched sushis and other dishes! the rose beer was a delight too  just cannot go often because it's pricey"}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome.  The interior is well appointed without being distracting.  I took my wife here for her birthday and she loved it.  She especially liked the lobster sushi.  The cuts were well sized and the rice was prepared just right.  I think a lot of sushi places tend to mess up the rice but this place pays attention to all the details.  The wasabi is fresh ground and not pumped from a tube.  The toro... amazing!  Definitely worth another visit!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!! I'm from BC and I know it's very rare finding a good fresh sushi out here in TO. But this place reminded me of Vancouver and it was just perfect. I gotta be honest the service was terrible however the sushi was very fresh and delicious which is why I will rate it 5 star. Pricing was very reasonable."}
{"text":"Surprise birthday dinner at JaBistro last week :) Very modern, upscale, a lively place to spend the evening.  My friend requested to sit at the sushi bar because we want to see all the action and preparation. Unfortunately, the sushi bar counter was TOO HIGH :( Couldn't see a thing... isn't it a bit pointless having a sushi bar? (-1)  We really enjoyed the blowtorched sushi plate (I believe it is called Aburri). I loveeeeed the smokiness and unique taste for each piece - must order again! The lobster sandwich was fantastic - they give you LOTS of lobster meat #yumm! The JaBistro roll sounds amazing (with salmon, snow crab, uni, etc.) but it was a hit and miss for us. For dessert, we had the banana mille feuille with citrus custard and caramel sauce - pretty tasty and quite different because the caramel was a bit bitter but doesn't affect the overall taste, worth a try :) They also give customers a piece of their homemade truffle at the end of the meal.  Nevertheless, a bit on the pricey side, but excellent food and service from start to finish :) Will return again!"}
{"text":"Freshest fish i have ever had hands down. Ordered the sashimi platter large, wagyu ouishizushi, and aburisushi. All were fantastic! Servers were attentive and the sushi bar was a good show. The o toro chew toro, geoduck , and spot prawns blew my mind. The place is on a pricy side and the down side is its not a lot of food too but quality is there.   Thanks mcdonalds ..."}
{"text":"go there now. but make a booking. if its your first time, pre-order the tasting menu - yes the big one. its worth it. you will leave fully satisfied. check their IG for details @jabistro222"}
{"text":"eating here was life changing... everything here was soooo gooood and soooo freshhhh... never looked for a soy sauce and each bite made me smile.... sushi rice was really good, each serving was simple yet sophisticated... blowtorch baby!.. i will definitely go back here each time i meet my wife in toronto! :)"}
{"text":"the food is fresh and the dishes are tasty.  the service is prompt and couteous.  however, i'm not sure i'd go if i wasn't going on the company's dime.  that's just me."}
{"text":"The worst service I've ever received. The food does not even make up for it. Don't even waste your time or money here. There are plenty of other Japanese restaurants with better food and service in Toronto."}
{"text":"New world Japanese cuisine.  There sushi are very special, using flame torch the fish so they are not 100% raw. Been to this place many times, this place always pleased my guests when I take them there.  There lobster miso soup is unique and uncommon for Japanese cuisine and very tasty.  Besides been slightly overpriced, I would give it 5 stars"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my meal here. Friendly staff, fresh sashimi, really good torches sushi. However for the money I payed, I can't justify to go back anytime soon......"}
{"text":"Insane!  I think that word accurately describes this place! But as you can see from the 5 stars insane is good.  The miso soup was amazing, I love that I got a lobster claw :) it made me feel I wasn't spending that much money on soup for no reason.  (Yes yes I know lobster used to be the \"poor\" man food, but I don't discriminate!!!)  We got the sashimi platter with lobster, aburi and blue fin tuna wrap roll hand roll thingie.    Woah hold on let me back up, this was my husbands first time trying real fresh sushi not the ayce stuff.  The second he put that salmon in his mouth, OMG it was like his life had changed forever!!!! He did tell me we're never going to an ayce again :( there goes cheap dinner night.  Anyways the food is fantastic fresh delicate great flavour. Presentation is insane.  My husband HATES mayo but loved the aburi haha maybe because I didn't tell him there was any mayo, it's ok he doesn't have yelp :p I KNOW ITS A SIN!!!  Blue fin tuna was wonderful as well!  Never had anything that tasted quite like it.    If I had to knock them off for something it would have to be their drinks.  I ordered an alcoholic beverage (I can't remember sorry!) and it didn't live up the the atmosphere, or the price.  But again I like my drinks at barchef a little too much....  All in all amazing service great environment and really fun!    First date approved Anniversary approved"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Must try the blow-torched sushi.  A bit pricey, but they got the BEST sushi in town, great location and great service."}
{"text":"You will come to realize that this place is as legit as it gets when there are Japanese patrons at the restaurant!   I came here with a couple family members for dinner - we had a 5pm reservation so we were seated right away. It did start to get packed within an hour, so I recommend making a reservation.  As for the food - an amazing experience! To be honest, I love sushi rolls, but I wasn't completely comfortable with eating totally raw fish, but I gave it a try, and guess what?! I'm so glad I did!  We got: -Lobster miso soup - Definitely one of the better miso soups I had! I got a claw in mine, which had quite a bit of meat in it! -Lobster Platter - deceptive name because this includes a lot more than lobster. There were all kinds of seafood; lobster, shrimp, salmon, mackerel, scallops, and even wagyu beef! Note that these are ALL raw (yes, even the lobster), so be very open-minded. Keeping that in mind, pretty much everything I tried was absolutely delicious! The lobster had an interesting texture but was really good, and so was the fatty tuna (mmmm, fatty tuna) -Carpaccio - delicious, and the sauce was great! -Ebi nanban - basically battered tiger shrimp with tartar sauce - so much yum -Aburicious Aburi - I've never heard of Aburi until I came here, so when I saw that they blowtorch the sushi, I wondered why this doesn't exist in NYC. The ones we tried had a unique smokey flavor, which just made it so much more bomb   We also got some dessert sake - I really don't like the taste of sake, but the one we had was sweet, and a perfect palate cleanser. It was so good that we ended up getting another bottle!  This is definitely a more elevated experience when it comes to sushi, without any of the fancy-pancy pretentiousness. Amazing quality fish, and overall a great experience!  Protip: Parents, please leave your kids at home. It's not a kid friendly place and having to hear a toddler crying in the background does get quite aggravating!"}
{"text":"Every time I'm in town, I come to JaBistro.  No joke.  The restaurant is awesomely chic on the outside- so nonchalantly cool that you might accidentally walk right by it because it has to signage posted outside- just a pretty cool, onyx-like wall.  Open the door and walk into a really chic restaurant with simple and clean decor.  Their menu is pretty simple, but honestly, letting the chef choose is going to be your best option.  I've had the omakase once and a chef's choice my second time, and both times I've really enjoyed it.  I like to sit at the bar at sushi places to watch the chefs do their thing and JaBistro is no excuse.  You really get to see how fresh the fish is.  One of my favorite things that they do is they DEEP FRY the shrimp heads if you get the shrimp sushi and you can eat the whole thing.  So yummy!  I will say that this place will cost you, so be prepared to spend some dough.  It's worth it though.  The fish is fresh and delicious.  Service is friendly and warm and my drink was always full.  I'll definitely be back.  Great sushi spot."}
{"text":"The OG of good sushi in downtown Toronto. The food is still good and service is friendly. A bit on the pricy side but great for a birthday / celebration.  Sashimi platters are fresh and nicely put together. The aburi rolls are a must!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing quality sushi here~  Service: Top notch and friendly, everyone was attentive and polite.   Ambience: Relaxed, professional lounge like. You can also sit at the bar and watch them make sushi.   Food: We ordered the $80 lobster platter and an Aburicious plate to share.  The lobster platter came with 2 bowls of lobster brother which was delicious with a full lobster claw.   The Variety on the sashimi platter was good as well. Very fresh, although I wish they also offered the o-toro on the small platter rather than just the Chu-toro sashimi and maybe more scallops rather than doubling up on the Tai, but nonetheless delicious.  The Aburicious sushi is a must order. Very delicious and lots of flavours exploding in your mouth and I like how you get to sample the other torched sushi in this plate. If we had more room in our stomach we would have ordered an extra Jabistro roll.. But maybe next time..   A bit pricey, but I would recommend giving it a try. Great place to impress a date if they love sushi!"}
{"text":"I have been twice for lunch. This place is phenomenal. The blowtorched sushi makes your tastebuds dance! The salmon and beef versions are my favourite. The lobster miso soup is outstanding as well. The dessert, green tea creek br√ªl√©e and green tea ice cream, was also fantastic.  The service is great too. Servers and sushi chefs are all very friendly and attentive. It is on the more expensive side each roll (6-8pcs) is about $15 to $20. Expect to spend about $100 for 2 people without drinks. So expect to pay a bit more than your usual sushi place. But this is not your usual sushi place either. It is well worth it."}
{"text":"Was here on a thursday night around 7pm, this place was packed, lots of reservation already made.  But we manage to grab seats by the bar!  We ordered the lobster sashimi platter, very fresh!  Their presentation was outstanding.  Due to the bar seating area, I didn't feel very comfortable, not the experience i would like.  Suggestion, if you would like to try this place for a special occasion, book in advance, to get tables~"}
{"text":"The sashimi, Japanese uni and fish collar tasted great!  I think they use good quality ingredients.  I tried the lobster sushi too, it's hard to go together because raw lobster has a chewy texture, and their rice breaks apart easily.  The disappointment is the aburi sushi and JaBistro roll, Miku at waterfront taste better than this. The aburi taste is not significant, and the oil didn't go down to the rice.  The rice became plain without taste.    The environment is nice, Japanese setting, with sushi bar, the smell of the food spread through the whole restaurant. The table top used soft leather like plastic, soft and clean.  It was a full house last night, high energy.  No loud music so we can talk among our own, though you can hear tables next to you, it's very close together.  Service is good, casual and nice.  Plates got changed half way.  The dishes come one after we finished another, I especially like this kind of serving.   Price is expensive, I don't think all are justified.  Some are, some are not.   Overall a nice dining experience.  The 1 star deducted for the disappointment with aburi sushi and roll. They are supposed to be their signature and specialties!"}
{"text":"Great addition to downtown TO... and that's about it.  We weren't acknowledged by our server until 20 mins later. The hostess had to take our cocktail orders (Veronika & Railroad Man) AND serve it to us. We finally placed our orders with our server - $50 sashimi platter + $10 lobster add on, snack of the day (mackerel) and kamo (smoked duck salad). Honestly, nothing on the menu made me salivate.   The waiting game continues. We finished the mackerel and kamo... but the sashimi platter took 45mins!!! The platter included tuna, salmon, amberjack (which actually was delicious!) and the lobster which we had paid extra for. We were hoping it was worth the wait. This selection of fish for $50? I feel ripped off since I could've had an omakase meal (incl. otoro, amaebi, hamachi, etc) at Zen for cheaper and satisfied. Since we weren't impressed by the dishes and nearly full, our plan was to check out one of the new ramen places close by. We asked for our check, but our server reminded us that we still have lobster miso (part of the add on). So we waited 40 mins for our soup. It really should've taken less than 10 because that's how fast it came when we asked about it. The soup wasn't anything special... only a few sips good until it became salty. Plus, lobsters come with 2 claws right? We only got one.  Their sushi IS fresh but their bistro menu wasn't anything special in my opinion. With the experience we had, we couldn't justify the price we paid and the time we waited for each dish to arrive."}
{"text":"Hands down ur go to place for fusion.  You can never go wrong with the sushi platter, abrushi roll, uni, chicken karage and lobster miso.  Servers are always friendly and the place has a great vibe!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite sushi restaurant in the city for the whole family. Sit at the bar and watch the master at work performing his art with meticulous grace. You feel honoured when being served each succulent morsel of the kyukyoku set (freshest pieces). What a great experience, especially the kids, to see how food should be respected.  And all this at a restaurant that's part of Kinka Family restaurant group.  Well done!"}
{"text":"Flamtorched sushi is what they are known for. Great little spot to go to. They also have a lobster miso soup which is quite special. For dessert their green tea cream brule is well balanced and very tasty."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to receive a gift card for this restaurant for my birthday, and after a year later I finally got the time to find a babysitter so my partner and I could fully enjoy ourselves.   It's not secret that I love Japanese food, and my visit to Ja Bistro had literally been a year in the making.   I ordered a 3oz cold sake, that tasted like a sweet apple juice (I seriously doubt there was any alcohol in it, it went beautifully with the fish). My partner opted for a non-alcoholic ginger tea since he doesn't drink alcohol.   We started off with the $50 sashimi platter. Everything was presented and explained to us upon delivery. The only one I didn't care too much for was the shrimp. It had such a slimy texture that I had to immediately wash down with my sake. Otherwise, delicious fish, beautifully presented. We were fortunate enough to sit at the sushi bar where we watched the chefs create these works of art.   After the sashimi platter we wanted to try the nigiri and blowtorched platter ($27). I don't even remember what each piece was, but I never tasted anything like them. Each piece came dressed in its own sauce, so no need for dipping in soy sauce. So unbelievably creamy and velvety!  Would love to come back again, but would skip on the sashimi plate and just try their blowtorched nigiri."}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday and everything was wonderful. We made reservations and my boyfriend even put in a special request for their own birthday celebration dessert with my name written on the plate with chocolate.  We ordered their Sashimi Sampler, Aburicious, and Sushi Nama Kyukyoku for two people and I was actually surprisingly full. I'm from the West Coast so I've tasted fresh seafood so when I moved to Toronto, I wasn't too enthused about exported seafood bu Jabistro was a surprise for me. I don't think I've had seafood as fresh as what they have at Jabistro - their tuna was on point and their aburi reminded me of Vancouver.  Service was excellent too so I would recommend going here for a celebration dinner or a treat yourself sort of day."}
{"text":"I would've loved to give JaBistro 5 stars based on service solely. There was constant check-ins without hovering, consistent refills of water, and they even lead me to the washroom when I asked for directions.   The food is a little above average but not worth the price point.  The calamari was a little oily and that ruined the overall taste of the dish.  We ordered the $100 and $50 platter or sashimi and although fresh and presented, it didn't wow me like I thought it would.  The black grilled cod was a little overwhelmed by the sauce. The fish is supposed to have a soft, sweet taste but the one served was somewhat \"fishy\".  My mom assured me the blowtorch dishes were amazing and seemed to \"melt in your mouth\".   Overall, it was a good experience but I don't see myself returning."}
{"text":"Took my boyfriend here on his birthday since he said he's never been so we went for the tasting menu - the 5 course prix fixe for $99 per person. You have to let them know in advance if you do decide to go with the prix fixes.  1) sashimi sampler - approximately 12 pieces. the sashimi was fresh, wide variety including salmon, hamachi, tuna, chu toro, toro, wagyu beef, and more.  2) lobster miso soup - i liked how they served the soup with the lobster claw - looks good for presentation and ensures you get a good piece of lobster meat. you can taste the lobster guts blended into the miso soup. 3) gindara - the miso black cod. The black cod was cooked just right, super soft as if it almost melts in your mouth. i love the sweetness added to it as well. 4) assorted sushi - 7 pieces of sushi and 1 piece of their jabistro roll. The choice of fish for sushis were pretty much the same as the sashimi sampler - would have been nice if uni or unagi was one of the 7 sushi pieces. The jabistro roll was tasty, it included salmon, snow crab, uni, cucumber, tobiko 5) dessert - green tea icecream and a creme brule, which tasted good and not too sweet. When I made reservations they asked if it was for any special occasion and I told them it was for a birthday. When they served our dessert, they did add in \"Happy birthday\" written in chocolate on the plate and added a candle to the dessert which was thoughtful. They also switched the background music to play a birthday song to go along with their staff singing happy birthday.  i enjoyed my meal. The food tasted great, the fish was fresh and service was good. Our food was served quick as well."}
{"text":"I really like this place! The service was good and the food was quite delicious.   I ordered the miso soup with lobster, sashimi platter ($50), aburicious, and salmon oshizushi, and a red-wine peer with vanilla ice cream.   The miso soup with lobster was good. I was expecting something that tasted like it came from a package but this tasted home-made. I'm not a big fan of miso-soup but this one was decent.   The sashimi platter consisted of various of raw fish and waygu beef. I really like the fatty tuna from all the selection. The waygu beef was alright. I didn't like it that much since it was slightly cold for my tasting.   The aubricious consisted of 2 ebi, 2 mackerel, 2 salmon, and 2 jabistroll. I really like the variation and the salmon was my favourite.   The dessert was meh. I wouldn't have ordered it again.   The bill came out to ~$113 before tax and I would say it was worth it."}
{"text":"The sashimi sampler is good but you don't get very thick pieces. Very good quality though.  The aburi is the star of the show and tasty. All options are good so if you can't decide get the sampler.   Be prepared to spend more than you would expect for sushi."}
{"text":"JaBistro scores high points in quality, speed, and service. The staff are extremely friendly and don't forget to ask how your meal is going. You feel fully taken care of as there is always someone walking and refilling water.  Their food is fresh, delicious and comes out very fast. It was actually surprising how fast our food came out. The restaurant was packed but they did have a lot of staff on deck.  To cut it short to, the food is great, the service is better, but the wallet will cry."}
{"text":"3.5, which perhaps would have been a solid 4 if I went on an evening rather than for lunch, on the patio (which is not worth it as it is now stuck between a tower and another one under construction  - perhaps better they close it for now...).  Menu was a simple sheet of used paper.  Food was good, some interesting torched sushis but the place was quite empty (which makes the ambiance always a little bit special) and I like my sashimis to be served cold (except when torched of course) but they were almost lukewarm when they arrived at the table.  I don't know... something did n't make it entirely for me. If you there, go in the evening, do not go on the patio."}
{"text":"I just love this place, I went there many times, always had great experiences. Just make sure you make a reservation before you go. I tried almost everything on the menu, they all really great, especially sashimi platter and the kyukyoku. Very fresh! Great service too. Alert! Once you tried this place you can't go back to cheap Japanese places anymore."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times already but my last visit was a part of a date before going to Ripley's Aquarium (a little odd I know). We were seated at their beautiful rooftop patio. The food here is impeccable. Fish are fresh and all the flavours are bright and engaging whether raw or torched. Aburicious and their oshizushi offerings are always a safe pick but in addition to that, we decided to try the horse carpaccio out of curiosity. I'm not sure what we were expecting but it was excellent, much like a ponzu flavoured beef tataki and a perfect segue into our sushi courses. My kyukyoku was an excellent spectrum of different fish and flavours, with our server kindly introducing each nigiri to me. After all my visits I've become an absolute sucker for ocean trout; it's similar to taste and appearance as salmon, but much cleaner and less overtly fatty. We padded our meal with some wagyu nigiri and rounded everything off by sharing a hojicha creme brulee. A consistently delightful experience. Despite it being a bit pricey, it's one of those celebratory/special date type restaurants I would always be down for."}
{"text":"Went here with my wife after work and were super anxious to try this restaurant because of the hype from online reviews and some friends.  But unfortunately, it did not  live up to the hype, according to us.    First off let me say that the atmosphere is great with a very friendly and attentive service.  Where it falls short is the taste for the price if offers.  We had the $99 fixed price menu per person and nothing really stood our in all of our plates.  In comparison to the sashimi offered at Yazu and ZeN omakase, it is definitely not on the same level as those 2.  It didn't have the \"melt in your mouth\" sensation that we got at previous high end sushi restaurants.    Hate to give it a low rating but for the price we paid, we expected more when other high end sushi places are cheaper but have better tasting."}
{"text":"Terrible service and hands-down the worst sushi I have ever had in my life. Fish is extremely chewy and impossible to swallow. I'd feel better eating sushi from a grocery store."}
{"text":"We ordered miso soup with the 3 pieces sushi add-on and the small sashimi platter to share.  The food is good but way too pricey even at lunch.  I would only go back to socialize as it is a popular venue; and even then limit the size of the group to 7 or less, as when there's 8 people, they get to pick what you order."}
{"text":"Phenomenal for anyone with an experienced pallet. Recommend getting the Kama, which is literally an entire fish head prepared in the most elegant manner. Also the Jabistroll is gold."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with a group of 6 and had a great time. I'd definitely recommend this place. We ordered the large Sashimi platter w/ Lobster and we were all full and satisfied at the end of the meal. Presentation was fantastic, service was great, and we all were pleased with our cocktail choices. We ate on the patio so that was also a huge plus for me. Overall fantastic place and I'd definitely go back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I came here for Valentine's Day , we had reservations but still had to wait ten minutes for our table.  I've been spoiled with Vancouver sushi the last five years so this place didn't blow my mind! We got the lobster sashimi platter, regular sashimi platter, and aburi sushi. Rice for the aburi was too chewy and thick. Seafood didn't taste that fresh to me and uni was not top notch. Probably wouldn't pay to come here again."}
{"text":"If you want to splurge and get quality sushi, look no further (swipes arms over table and knocks everything off)  This is my third time here and there has never been a disappointing visit. I only come here when I feel fancy or rich. Their lobster miso soup is creamy and sublime and definitely a favourite. If you can get a sashimi platter, the presentation is fantastic and the quality is unmatched for downtown Toronto.   The only gripe I have is that it's so popular that it's unlikely that you can walk in without a reservation .. it feels like an Izakaya but is in such high demand. I wish I could come here once a month but alas, I can't afford it"}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: You can't actually see from the bar. #FAIL.  Whenever a \"high end\" sushi place opens up with bar seating, comparisons to Kaji is inevitable. What's also inevitable, unfortunately, is the high price but not the quality. In this regard, although I've heard good things about their sashimi platter + lobster (for another $30), I'm not sure it's a good value.  Let me get it out of the way - I like JaBistro, but it's pricey, but that's what you get for getting a great location. For only a little bit more, I'd go to Kaji in a heartbeat instead. The windowless decor feels very \"NYC\" and the service was great. I even noticed that staff would run into the washrooms in between uses to fold up the TP into a triangle - talk about attention to detail (I hope they sanitized their hands though...)!   What bummed me out were 2 things: first, you could barely see over the divider at the bar, which pretty much defeats the purpose of sitting there. And second, while the chefs were polite, they didnt' seem particularly enthusiastic or engageable.   Let's get on with the dishes:  KYUKYOKU - We really enjoyed the chef's freshest cuts of 10 pieces of sushi ranging from blue fin tuna (it's a threatened species in case that matters to you) to lobster to blow-torched kobe beef. The quality was very good, though the temperatures of the different fishes seemed to be inconsistent.  YUKKE - The angus tartare was very fresh with a nice wasabi flavour to it. I would definitely recommend this for one of your appetizers.  GINDARA - Like a nice steak, I'm always torn at ordering black cod since it's fairly simple to prepare at home and you can get so much more! Nonetheless, it was done perfectly with an appropriate amount of crispiness to it.  TORI NANBAN - Ugh, I really wasn't impressed by what amounted to battered chicken in tartar sauce. Pretty pricey as well, and you're probably better off ordering something else.  As for drinks and dessert, we enjoyed their cocktails and the parfait. They make it well here, and it's worth ordering.  All in all, a great place to impress a date or friends from out of town, but I wouldn't exactly rush to come back."}
{"text":"Food: 4/5 Ambiance: 4/5 Service: 5/5 Value: 4/5  Came here for a weekday lunch, and the restaurant was relatively empty (just a few business lunches) so my party of 3 was seated very quickly. We ordered the saba oshizushi, ebi oshizushi, and salmon oshizushi, along with two fish bowls. I actually haven't had oshizushi before, but it's pressed sushi, where the fish is pressed first before being placed on the sushi rice. At Ja Bistro, the fish was also blowtorched, which added this buttery texture to the fish that was melt-in-your-mouth delicious! All of the oshizushis were absolutely magnificent.   The fish bowls were less special -- sort of what you would expect from a chirashi bowl, although the presentation was quite beautiful. I would definitely say to go for the oshizushi if you are coming here, rather than the fish bowl.  I would say this was certainly a pricy lunch, but the sushi was very good!  How likely would I be to recommend to a family or friend? 8 :)"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in Toronto. Lobster miso & Sashimi Platter are on point  (~$100) and feeds 4 people.  High quality ingredients. Stellar bartender ( very knowledgeable, clearly passionate about his job). Excited to sit on their patio during summer."}
{"text":"The best sushi I've ever had. The blowtorched sushi is amazing to watch being prepared and even better to eat. Chef's tasting of sashimi also will not disappoint.   I came here last year and knew JaBistro was on the list of places to visit this year. Can't wait to come back next October! Thanks everyone!  Update - in Toronto for the day and finally had time for the tasting menu. Wow!"}
{"text":"Came here a couple times and I have a great experience whenever I come. Staff is really great, the sushi is fresh, and the atmosphere is laid back and relaxed. As far as sushi in Toronto goes I would say this is one of my favourites. The place tends to be busier at dinner but for lunch I don't have trouble walking in without a reservation. The menu doesn't really change so after coming here a couple times, you feel like you have pretty much tried everything. Still a solid sushi place but we might head somewhere else to try something different."}
{"text":"My friend took me to JaBistro on my birthday.It is a small restaurant right besides Yuk Yuks on Richmond and Simcoe. The interior is very elegant and has an authentic feel to it. The waiters were very friendly and explained the menu in detail since we had a lot of questions. We ordered the JaBistro platter,torched sushi and sashimi sampler. Let me tell you honestly I eat sushi every week but I will never forget this experience. The fish was so fresh and the torched sushi was to die for. When I go there next time,I am only eating torched sushi. The platter had salad,sushi,sashimi,miso soup and few tempuras and there was absolutely nothing that disappointed me. I have become a fan and I am going there again for sure. The washrooms were super clean and even had mouthwash which I appreciated after eating so much fish :)"}
{"text":"I hit up Jabistro for the first time because I'd heard wonderful things about their sashimi platter.  It didn't disappoint.  A friend and I tucked in for the $100 platter for two, adding the $30 lobster sashimi option, and we were blown away.  The presentation was a thing of beauty.  As for the food itself, the quality was impeccable and the value was stellar.  There were four pieces of everything served: beautiful maguro, chutoro, and otoro; two kinds of salmon, including a gorgeous cut of belly; wagyu beef; ikura; Boston uni that was sweet and fresh, easily the best uni I've ever had; Spanish mackerel; amberjack; snapper; sea bream; monkfish liver and monkfish jelly; tako; ika that melted in the mouth; the fat from the wagyu beef made into... some... dried thing that was intriguing; giant clam that reminded me of the smell of Tsukiji Fish Market; fried fish skin; fried fish scales; and a two pound lobster.  Pickles and a few other accoutrement accompanied the platter, and a lobster miso soup finished things off.  A few days later I returned for the lunch platter, which included more lobster miso soup; three pieces of torched aburi sushi (cured mackerel, salmon, and tiger shrimp); three pieces of the signature Jabistro roll; some of the best calamari I've ever tasted, spectacularly tender; a delicious tori nanba; and a pleasant grilled shrimp salad.  A perfunctory dessert accompanied, and for $30 it again felt like a tremendous value given the quality and quantity of the food.  Jabistro's not cheap, but as far as I know the quality's unparalleled in the downtown core, and you're certainly not going to leave hungry.  Sushi fans who usually stick to AYCE fare may find it a bit tough to approach, but long-time sushi lovers will love it.  The service was outstanding in both my experiences; my server for dinner was remarkably well-informed about everything on the platter, and was attentive without being overbearing.  Another server at lunch was right on the ball as well, without hovering.  Both were friendly and conversational.  There are lots of ways a place like Jabistro could go wrong, and it would be easy for this place to be snooty, overpriced, or to miss the mark on the actual fish.  But the service is wonderful, the value's there, and the quality's consistently high.  I was deeply impressed."}
{"text":"I was never much of a fan of sushi until I ate here. Gotta give this place credit for turning a cuisine I didn't care for to one I adore. JaBistro is of course on the pricey side, but good quality sushi usually is. Every piece is extremely flavourful and makes you wish you could just lie down on a conveyer belt and have these pieces fed to you endlessly. There's alot of great reviews already for this site so putting it simply, if you want excellent sushi, eat here. The only way you'll leave disappointed is if you can't get a seat or the unfortunate time when there's no more food on the table."}
{"text":"Order the sashimi platter, duck soba and calamari. And sit outside on the patio :)."}
{"text":"The aburi sushi and Jabistroll are favourites among people for a reason - they are really yummy! Everything is pricey on the menu but you do get higher quality sashimi and sushi than most other Japanese restaurants in the same price range. The ambiance is also very nice - simple but modern and doesn't try too hard to look upscale. I would recommend making reservations as the restaurant is not that large and quite busy all the time."}
{"text":"Last night I was excited to take my gf here for her birthday. I had made reservations online and even called in ahead of time to make sure my seats were reserved. I also heard some good things from some of my foodie friends.   As I walked in the hostess greeted me while on the phone. She asked me would I like to sit at the sushi bar. I told her that we would like to sit at a table. She said I would have to wait a few minutes which became about 15 minutes. I was already pretty annoyed that I had to wait for my seat when I had made reservations.  Finally she walks us to our table and as I was walking I notice that there are empty tables. That even made me more upset than I already was.   We sit down and we are greeted by our waitress after I had to flag another one down so we could order. As I was ordering. It was actually harder then I thought because it seemed like we didn't understand eachother. When we finally got our order in, we waited a bit and the food came. Food was good but not worth what you pay for. I had ordered a dessert, the ny cheesescake. I got a plate with 2 small pieces with a scoop of green tea ice cream for $8! I was very disappointed.   I had a very bad experience and I think I will never ever go there again. To me the money I spent was definitely not worth the service I had to deal with. Although the one male English speaking waiter was very helpful. Other then him, they can get rid of the waitress and start with the hostess.   How do they say 'bye' in Japanese? Oh yea. 'Sayonara'"}
{"text":"Best sushi & sashimi I ever tasted in Toronto.   No fishy smell... not overdone .. just perfecto !  I recommend this place if you don't mind blowing $200 dinner night"}
{"text":"This place is very popular, we booked it one week ahead. It was a small restaurant like all other japanese restaurant, that was not surprising. The service was very good,   We ordered lobster sashimi plate, classic nigiri sushi and blowtorched sushi, and a green tea cream bulee, pear compote. We have four people, and that was $130/person.  Very fresh meat. Blowtorched sushi is so far the best, taste like the same as Miku'1s. Sashimi plate is really fantastic, the moment you taste them in your mouth you could feel it's freshness.  Overall a very good experience, but was too expensive though. But would go again definiitely sometime in the future."}
{"text":"I know I should not eat alone that often?!   I really want to try out JaBistro's Tasting Menu ($55). On their website, there is no where it is stated that in order to enjoy that, one cannot come here by alone... get a date, get a friend... which I should have. I was sad and disappointed when I was informed that I have to order off the regular menu.  I ended up ordering Aburi ($27) which was really good. I even enjoy my mackerel!! I would order that again.   Green Tea Puff ($10) which was also excellent. Nicely plated, tasted as good as it looks!  I cannot comment on the cooked food and I only able to sample 2 items on the menu but overall aside from the misunderstanding with the Tasting Menu's situation, I do enjoy what JaBistro offers.  I guess I might go back and have some more sashimi and sushi."}
{"text":"I could eat the aburi and Jabistroll forever!! This is in my top 3 sushi restaurants in the city! Always so soft and creamy, melt-in-your-mouth and flavourful."}
{"text":"I would say it is a 5 star restaurant in Toronto downtown after having a wonderful fish bowl."}
{"text":"Having heard so many good words about this place. We tasted their sashimi, Wangyu beef tataki, torched Jabistro and other forgot-name sushi. The sashimi tasted great, but not better than other named places. In fact, Touhenbouku Distillery and Kingyo have just as good sashimi with better cuts and prices. Wagyu beef tataki was good, but it was chewy because of wide streaks of fat and can-be-thinner cut. It was mouth blowing until the sushi came in. All of them tasted amazing for their individual character composed of many layers of texture, temperature, and flavor. It was a heavenly trip for my tongue. I could not remember how many times I sreamed \"wow\" and \"Oyishi\". I will definitely return in the future, for their sushi!"}
{"text":"Must try place if you like sushi. The menu items are slightly expensive, but you get what you pay for. The quality of food here never disappoints. I love their fresh seafood and wagyu melt on your tongue everything. Its like heaven in one bite, leaving you craving for more. My stable menu item are wagyu and salmon aburi; the ebi aburi is delicious too. If you like creme brulees the hoji creme brulee is amazingly delightful. Very flavourful and not too sweet."}
{"text":"It was between this or Miku. I've heard such raving reviews from friends saying that this is superior and even their site mentions that they're the best sushi of Toronto. Now I don't mind spending a bit more on quality sushi but honestly these were huge claims that didn't really live up to the hype.   Ordered  The menu was simple but limited. We tried the $100 sashimi platter, a selection from their torched sushi - wagyu beef, aburicious (a sample of each torched sushi but doesn't include wagyu beef). Sashimi was slightly sweet perhaps from the authentic wasabi that compliments it. Expect that green tea would be extra in a restaurant like this.  We concluded that the jabistroll and ebi oshizushi (shrimp) to be the best. The sauce and combination of textures really makes these rolls stand out.   However after eating this for a while everything just melds together and was quite same and left me wanting more variety. Perhaps the tasting menu would have been a better bet and made it more memorable.  Service They take your jackets and most of the waiters are Japanese who barely have a hold on the English language. I could hardly understand them but I guess their good looks and attentiveness makes up for it ha!  Overall  If you're anything like me who doesn't mind paying more for sushi at times but appreciate good value, I wouldn't recommend this place. It just didn't blow me away and make it that memorable. I hate comparing regular restaurant to ayce but I wouldn't say it was much better than Kaka's (ayce) special sushi (limit 1pc each) they only have available only on the weekends."}
{"text":"Took my dad here for Father's Day dinner and was very happy with the experience. The waitstaff was very friendly and allowed us to choose bar or table seating.  We shared the large lobster platter and was pleasantly surprised when the lobster miso soup came out with it. We didn't know this was apart of the experience. We each got large claws of meat in the soup and the fish and lobster sashimi was very fresh! For the price though, I wish uni came on it as well since I asked what was different between the large and small platters and was told we could get sweet shrimp, fattier tuna and uni but only got the first two.  For drinks I got the Green Tea Mojito and my dad got the sake tasting. He enjoyed his but I feel as though the mojito wasn't flavorful enough - it lacked the green tea flavor and all I could taste was mint.  Overall it was a good experience! Would def come here again as the restaurant is small, cozy and not too loud or at least the first floor was."}
{"text":"I have been here on three occasions, and it has remained one of my favorite sushi spots in Toronto. JaBistro is a modern Japanese restaurant known for their beautifully presented sashimi platters, and blowtorched sushi.   Both of my previous dinners took place during the winter time (third experience was lunch), so I was not aware that JaBistro had a rooftop patio. The patio is open every summer until it gets too cold, as they don't have any overhead heat system. JaBistro's Rooftop Patio was tastefully designed with its sleek use of wood, and string lights. It provided a more zen ambiance compared to their dining space downstairs. The patio seats 40 guests, with the possibility of using the eastern (direction) side of 20 seats for private functions.  JaBistro offers a more elevated dining experience by offering both classic and contemporary dishes that are sourced using the finest, and freshest dish from coastal waters around the world. We started off our menu tasting with the first course, a beautifully plated sashimi platter accompanied with a glass of wine. JaBistro did not disappoint me with their selection, and the sashimi platter was a great indication of the rest of the meal. The sashimi was silky, buttery, and fresh.  Up next was a platter containing chef's choice of 3 nigiri, and 4 oshizushi, including one of my favorites, the JaBistro Roll. The JaBistro Roll is a signature roll filled with salmon, snow crab, uni, cucumber, tobiko, mayo, and then lightly torched. Additionally, the uni provided a nice creamy texture to the roll, which I really enjoyed.  Oshizushi is pressed sushi, and is made by pressing sushi rice and fish into a mould to create a rectangular shape, and then lightly seared with a blowtorch. The oshizushi sushi are topped off with different toppings to give each one a distinct taste. For example, the salmon was topped off with thin slices of jalape√±o, while the mackerel was topped with scallion and daikon radish. Additionally, all the aburi are already seasoned with their in-house soy sauce, and wasabi. My favorite was the salmon oshizushi, and it is one of my must-have dishes.  We ended the night off with dessert; a delectable green tea flavored mousse cake with vanilla ice-cream. The chocolate sponge cake was layered with creamy and light green tea mousse, and topped off with strawberries. This combination created a very airy cake with subtle sweetness. Perfect for those who aren't into super sweet desserts. If you like sweets, then the accompanied ice-cream should satisfied that craving.  JaBistro is a great place for business meals, dates, or special occasions. Overall, JaBistro is a great place to dine for its quality food, attentive service, and we had an enjoyable dining experience up on their rooftop patio. They are open for lunch Monday-Fri from 11:30 am to 2:30 pm, and dinner from Sun-Thurs (5 pm to 11 pm), and Fri-Sat (5 pm to 12 am)."}
{"text":"My absolute favourite restaurant in Toronto. It could definitely get expensive if you're a big eater but it's so worth trying for a special occasion.  Their nigiri sushi and jabistro rolls are good but the absolute must orders are the aburi/pressed sushi selection. So creamy it literally melts in your mouth!! Seriously so impressed with everything I've tried from here.   Con: parking is pricy bc of location; subway there if you can!  5/5!!!"}
{"text":"This place is much fancier on the inside than expected. We got the miso soup, pork belly, aburicious and JaBistroll. Everything was delicious. The aburicious was amazing! The flavours were amazing and very unique. The miso soup was also better than the usual, and they give you a big piece of crab leg. The JaBistroll was good too, but I'd say the aburicious is a better buy because you get to try different kinds of sushi, and it includes a few JaBistroll pieces. The JaBistroll rolls in particular are pretty small although they do give you more of them. Lastly, the pork belly was very tender and delicious although. My only complaint is that the tables are very close together so you don't expect much privacy."}
{"text":"Best sushi in toronto. Everything on the menu is unbelievable and fresh. We get the abaricious every time we go.   The staff is so kind and remember names and faces."}
{"text":"JaBistro is probably one of the top sushi restaurants in the city - and I was very excited to be able to try.  I arrived at 7PM with a reservation and was seated at the Sushi Bar.  This was a pretty neat place to sit as you go to see the chefs make their sushi as well as blowtorch their sushi.  We were given a menu, which consisted of sashimi, blowtorched sushi, specials of the day, and hot food items.    The service was pretty good - our waitress was a little bit aloof but very friendly nonetheless.  We would probably expect a little more given how high-end the restaurant appears to be.  Attentive to our water levels - but mixed up our orders and offered us a dessert menu when our mains have not all come.   1) Sashimi Platter: Consisted of a mix of tuna, scallop, mackerel, trout and others.  The fish in the sashimi platter is very fresh - one of the best in the city.  We were also given a sweet soy sauce and a housemade soy sauce to dip.  A great mix of fish of wonderful quality overall. 2) Ebi nanban: Deep friend shrimp to perfection - the batter is well seasoned and not too heavy.  The tartar sauce was just divine - but I'm a sucker for tartar sauce.  A pretty good value of a dish for the restaurant as it came with 7 shrimps. 3) Ebi oshizushi: The blowtorch sushi series is their claim to fame and I completely understand why.  The Ebi Oshizushi is smoky with a well seasoned shrimp. On first glance, it may seem like the rice is quite hefty, but it works well with how flavourful the shrimp is. 4) Salmon oshizushi: The salmon oshuzushi is also wonderful.  I loved the jalapeno addition to the top and gives it a nice kick.   5) JaBistroll: Lots of textures with the fish roe, uni, salmon and snow crab.  It is a party in your mouth. 6) Horse Tataki - Rougher than a beef tataki but gives you a great chewiness.  I loved the sauces that it came with especially the sea salt sesame oil.  7) Uni - Wonderful, tasted like the sea without an excessive fishy taste.  We thought it was a lot of wasabi but it worked well with the uni.  Beautiful texture. 8) The Aji and the Yellowtail was also wonderful. 9) Finished off with a green tea mousse that I enjoyed quite a bit but it wasn't exactly out of the world in my opinion.  Good strong matcha flavours with a scoop of pretty good vanilla ice cream.     As you can tell, I am quite impressed with JaBistro.  No way to sugarcoat that it is a pricey spot to have sushi.  However, it's definitely worth it if you want your night out to include a great sushi meal."}
{"text":"Made reservations for 5pm on a Friday night for two. The doors opened at 5pm for their dinner hour and was seated right away.   We ordered three dishes: 1) Lobster palette (small): a mix of sashimi (2-3 pieces of around 10 types of fish, 2 pieces of wagyu beef, and lobster) along with 2 bowls of lobster soup. 2) Jabistroll roll: a popular choice amongst guests at Jabistro. Consists of uni, salmon, snow carb and fish eggs.  3) Ebi Oshizushi: The shrimp was flavourful and was just the right amount of smoky. Definitely seasoned to perfection. My favourite dish thus far!  The restaurant was small and the seats were close in proximity to each other which is what I would dock 0.5 a star for. It was hard to move around with our coats while first being seated and while leaving. The environment wasn't too loud during this time and the lighting and environment was quite cozy.   The service was great. My water was never less than half empty and our server was very attentive to our needs. Very friendly staff!  The bill came to about 150$ for two people which is what you would expect of a quality sushi restaurant. If youre a fan of sushi and sashimi, i highly recommend trying this place if you don't mind the 3 dollar signs. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've heard from multiple sources that JaBistro has the best sushi in the city.  So for my sister's birthday, I decided to take my family to try it out! We knew that the price tag was not going to be cheap, so it was definitely a splurge meal.   Not knowing that tea was not free, my cousin, sister, and mom all ordered a green tea ($4 each). I have nothing against the tea itself, but paying $4 seemed a bit excessively for tea. I myself got a virgin mojito ($7)- matcha syrup, simple syrup, lime, mint, and soda. I would've liked it to be a little sweeter, but overall, it was a refreshing drink.    We ordered a couple of bistro items in addition to sushi and sashimi. The first item to arrived was the lobster sandwich ($20) - sun-dried tomato croquette, poached egg. I thought that a sandwich to help fill us up given that the sashimi probably wouldn't. I enjoyed the simple preparation and light seasoning of the lobster, which allowed its natural flavours to shine.   Of course, we had to try their famous sashimi platter ($50). The quality of everything was great, but we all wished for a little more food for $50. I think ordering two platters would've been too much food, but one wasn't quite enough to share amongst the five of us.   We're a family of black cod-lovers so we couldn't go pass the Gindara ($22)- with bacon and curry shrimp toast. The black cod was all buttery goodness, but what stood out for me was the curry shrimp toast.   My favourite thing of the entire meal was the JaBistroll ($22)- salmon, snow crab, uni, cucumber, tobiko. The roll literally melted in my mouth and the combination of uni, salmon and crab meat was absolutely heavenly! I've never had a roll like this one before.    My sister also really wanted to try the aburi  sushi ($27)- blowtorched 7 pieces.  I loved that the blowtorch brings out that delicious fattiness in the fish. Sadly, amongst the 5 of us, I could only try two half pieces, but everything I had was lovely.   And because it was a birthday celebration, we had to get desserts! The first is their daily special ($10) - banana mille feuille with citrus custard and caramel sauce. It was super tasty but difficult to share among five people. I think I had a small bite.   The second dessert we had was the Sakura Puff ($10)- cherry blossom puff pastry, red bean custard cream, and matcha green tea ice cream. I loved this one too, and again wished I got more than just a few bites. I'm not a big fan of cream puffs in general, but this one was very good and made me want more.   Our meal ended with complimentary mint chocolate truffles. I didn't try any of this since I don't like mint chocolate in general. All in all it was a very good meal, but I can't say that it's the best sushi that I've ever had (I've had arguably better or at least comparable sushi in my travels in Asia and New York). While it may be the best I've had in Toronto, it is also the most expensive, so I'm not sure I can come here too often. That said, the JaBistroll was an absolute standout for me and it's something that I would come back for."}
{"text":"Sake was very over priced. The staff was rushing us to leave and the sushi/food menu was very limited. They can't make anything to accommodate vegan or vegetarian diet. The sake was slow to come out and cost $42! For 10oz. We unfortunately took the waiters suggestion on that on good faith and paid for it. I would not recommend this place to the average person or normal sushi goer."}
{"text":"I wish I didn't have a headache while I was visiting this place so I could have maybe had a better experience... but anyways, I was pretty excited to come here to try their prix fixe menu ($77 for 5 courses). I made an online reso a few weeks in advance and was odded out by the fact that I had to select either the cod or the wagyu steak for my entire party.. what if we wanted to try different ones?! Though I wanted to try the wagyu steak, one of my friends is a pescetarian so I had to go with the cod instead for the whole table (still annoyed about this btw, I wanted steak!!).  Ok so upon entrance into Jabistro, my first tip is to not sit near the bar area during the winter. It's right in front of the doors and the poor group of people there sat eating in their jackets! My party got seated near the back (pretty small place btw) and the heat was blasted way too high which was such a big difference from the bar area.   Servers were quite friendly and proceeded to get started with our 5 course meal - very quickly might I add. Before we were even finished a course, the next one would be ready and placed in front of us. It's great when you're hungry but if I'm trying to enjoy a nice meal, I'd like to take my time. The whole time we felt rushed to hurry up and move onto the next plate. Our whole 5 course dining experience took less than an hour... The couple next to us ordered a different tasting course and were in and out even quicker than us.   My favourite was the sashimi platter - super fresh and loved the toro! The scallop was ok but not as amazing as Yasu's! In terms of the lobster miso soup, I would've rather they put a lobster claw than the head, not much meat in the head but it did make for a nice broth. The black cod was good but actually not as good as the Sablefish from Cactus Club (sorry!). The aburi sushi was excellent, very comparable to Miku. Lastly, the green tea brulee... idk it was cold and not very tasty, but it did come with a scoop of green tea ice cream as well! Overall, I'd say to just stick with the sashimi and sushi here and skip the rest. I'd recommend ordering just off the menu rather than doing a tasting course.  The whole atmosphere reminded me of Guu, small and crowded and quite lively. I don't know if I'd recommend this place for a romantic date. With the price you're paying, you're much better off going to Miku or Yasu for a more refined dining experience. Jabistro would be more suited for a casual date at a higher price point but with quality sushi! (Photographers, the lighting is terrible here too sorry btw!)"}
{"text":"All the ingredients were very fresh. Can't say anything bad about this place but it wasn't spectacular. However service was impeccable."}
{"text":"Came here a few times in the past and it certainly doesn't disappoint. It is a little cramped, but in terms of sushi/sashimi, one of the best in Toronto!  The lobster sashimi is amazing, quality is always fresh and they always have new twists or items on their sashimi platter's that's very different from what other Japanese places serve.   It's definitely expensive, but you get what you pay for. Quality is amazing.   Looking forward to visiting again!"}
{"text":"This is the most delicious sushi place I've ever been to. The Rice is different, the soy sauce is different, the wasabi is different,the sashimi is so fresh, In a good way!"}
{"text":"The food was great but customer service (specifically re: the manager) not so much. My boyfriend made a dinner reservation (6pm on a Sunday) to take me out for my birthday. We were really looking forward to it since we had heard great things about this place but were quickly disappointed when we were taken to our seats at the bar. Maybe we're old-fashioned but we prefer to sit at a dining table (as opposed to the bar). We asked the hostess whether we could sit at one of the many empty tables (mind you the restaurant was not even 30% full at this time). The hostess quickly declined our request and said the other tables were reserved (which we found strange because we had made a reservation as well - specifically at a table too, not the bar). We asked to speak to the manager who was not helpful at all and continued to tell us that she is unable to seat us elsewhere. She then asked us to wait and went back to her table seating plan to see what she could do. Again she came back with no solution. This back and forth continued 2 more times and she said the best she could do was ask us to wait 1.5 hours for the next table! (Again, the restaurant is barely full and there is no line up) At this point, we are really disappointed by the customer service. This whole process took a good 30 min where we could have been seated right away but no the manager did not seem to know the concept of 'accommodating your guests'. In the end she finally made a table for us, but no apology for the inconvenience. Instead she just sent her hostess to take us to our new table and did not speak to us for the rest of the night. Like I said in the beginning. The food was great! Our server was excellent! But the manager just left a sour taste before we even started our meals. To top it all off, as we were leaving (around 8pm) we saw multiple empty tables (plus there was an empty table beside ours the entire time we dined).  JaBistro - you guys need to step up the training of your managers! Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be a returning customer any time soon."}
{"text":"It nice little trendy mysterious place hidden away in the streets of Richmond.I ordered the Aburicious blow torch sushi, it was rich and delicious. The blow torching added a nice suitable caramelized flavor.  The and tori nanban fried chicken with slaw on the other hand was  average and lacked flavor. I am not sure why they covered the chicken with slaw and tons of mayo which made the chicken batter soggy.   Lastly I have to mention the kettle they used for the making my tea that bug me the most. Its one of those \"PLASTIC\" Proctor brand kettle you would get at walmart for around $10-20. I don't know about you, but I have real problem with boiling water in plastic. I think you would agree with me that for the prices they are  charging they can afford to upgrade to a $50 stainless steel kettle or a commercial grade hot water dispenser which will fit their decor more and be  better for the customer's health.     Overall 4 stars for the sushi"}
{"text":"Nigiri is perfect here and Sashimi is fresh too!!!  my favorite nigiri and sashimi place in toronto!!!  price is a bit high but it fit with the food quality here!!!"}
{"text":"I need to say that I am extremely disappointed with my experience because I feel like I got ripped off - And I am not a cheap guy, I will pay for value any day of the week. So Two of us ordered the $50 platter. The sashimi was average and light on quantity.  I had to order two more over priced dishes and desert.  I paid $135 before tip for fish , rice, and a couple drinks. The way I see it there are 50 other places in the city you can dine at and get the same experience for half the price. One thing I will say is that the service was nice and attentive, met my expectations. But regardless even If the price was right I would still give it 3 stars, there is nothing overly unique about this place..."}
{"text":"Tried the $30 sampler sashimi. Very fresh. Should order a larger portion. And the roll was fantastic!"}
{"text":"blow torched pressed sushi  are so yummy ... especially the jabistro roll.. so special! Sashimi are the best quality, and the dressings and etc are just the right portion. I usually prefer sushi with less rice so I found the nigiri rice being slightly too much for me. But still good! Definitely going to come back another time."}
{"text":"I can definitely understand why this place is so popular. The atmosphere, in my opinion, can be described as classy and intimate because of the decor and how small the place is and the waiters didn't come off as pretentious at all. What you pay for is the much higher quality in fish. Now I can't say I'm an expert in Japanese cuisine but I felt like the fish quality didn't meet my expectations compared to the price on the menu. Maybe it's just easier to get high-quality fish in places like Vancouver and Hawaii. But to be reasonable, the food was still top-tier and I have no other complaints. I would almost always book a reservation beforehand due to how busy this place gets."}
{"text":"Jabistro lives up to the hype. I had been wanting to try this restaurant ever since it's opened. I finally went with my family on a Wednesday night and the restaurant was still busy as ever. The service is great and the waiters will not hesitate to answer your questions or refill your cups.  We got: - Sashimi platter ($100) - Beautifully plated I couldnt help but take several pictures. There was fresh fish (toro, geoduck, salmon, hamachi, etc.) and all the pieces were delicious. We even got 2 types of soy sauce to dip our fish in (one is premium, the other is house made); I preferred the house made soy sauce as it was less salty.  - Lobster miso soup - Lobster flavour was apparent and the soup was not too salty. They were generous with the amount of actual lobster in the soup too! - Ebi oshizushi - This was delicious. I had tried a sample of Jabistro's blow torched sushi at the Taste of Toronto event last summer and I had been waiting to eat their sushi again. Blowtorched pressed shrimp sushi with basil mayo. Amazing. - Salmon oshizushi - Also amazing.  - Jabistro roll - The roll was fresh and tasted quite fishy (so if you aren't a fan of that particular taste, be warned). The rice was soft and the whole roll was literally melt in your mouth. - Pork belly - This was a special that day. The pork belly was fatty and tender and melted in your mouth. Very heavy but delicious. - For dessert, we got the matcha tiramisu and cream puffs. Both were average (could have had more matcha flavour).   Overall, great meal. We left feeling very full and satisfied with the food and service. I would go back again for the blow torched sushi!"}
{"text":"Seemed nice... But just ok. Very loud. The signature roll was expensive yet mushy and blah. Go somewhere less loud and with good service our waiter vanished and a fish collar took about 15 minutes to arrive. Wanted to like it but sorry, no,"}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite a la carte sushi joint. Every time is a pleasure and every dish is created perfectly. I always order the lobster large platter because it never ever disappoints. The salmon oshisuzhi (sp) is great as well! Every bite is worth it and the service is always attentive and quick!  Make sure to make reservations! It's a small place and can get busy."}
{"text":"The place is exactly like a modern Japanese Restaurant. The taste of sushi is so fresh and delicious. High recommended! Great location and reasonable price!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice. The first time is a girls' gathering, among four of us, we ordered pretty much everything on the menu (it's a small menu, and the girls who have been here before says anything is good so don't worry just order ahead lol), we tried: lobster miso soup (amazing, I don't like any ANY restaurant miso soup, my mom and my husband's home made miso soup made me very picky, but I love this one, because the lobster broth very nicely compliments the miso flavor) hokkaido salad (nothing special) sashimi sampler (love, everything is fresh and tasty) nama: again very fresh  wagyu oshizushi: I don't like it, I don't like the beef is a bit hard compare to other melting fish ebi oshizushi: not too fond of the smokey flavor JaBistroll: very lovely for the first one, got a bit too rich for a second one salmon oshizushi: loooooooove, creamy, rich but not too rich, melt in your mouth, I crave it everyday  so the second time, when just me and my husband, we ordered a bigger sashimi plate, it is amazing, they prepared two pieces for each type (considering its for the two of us?), lobster soup is good, and of course nama, and my favourite salmon oshizushi, we also tried the aburicious, and you are suppose to eat it by the order it presents, which is a very nice thing - makes me feel I'm experiencing some serious culinary art or something lol.   it's not cheap, I think 60-80 per person, but I think its worth the money, and so far I haven't found any other restaurant has the awesome oshizushi, if any one knows please let me know, I d love to give it a try!"}
{"text":"Delicious, well prepared sushi.   Extremely fresh.  We ordered a large assortment of things for a table of 4.   Was really good - especially beef tartare (not sure the exact name on menu as I didn't order.)  Service wasn't the greatest.   The waitress was slow, messed up my drink and was generally inattentive.   I am guessing some of the other servers were a bit better.    Food **** Service *1/2 Ambience ***"}
{"text":"I come here whenever I want fresh sushi and not have to have it omakase style. Here they are known for their pressed sushi. I always order the salmon and kobe beef pressed sushi and their sashimi platter w lobster. Dessert menu is not great but thats ok. The price point is reasonable."}
