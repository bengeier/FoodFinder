{"text":"Very healthy portion of chicken  on the firehouse chicken sandwich  and served with sweet potato fries. Fantastic"}
{"text":"Good food after a long day. Several vegetarian options. Would go back when in the area."}
{"text":"Read some positive reviews and decided to give it a shot.  Very good food with a great staff.  Friendly and very attentive.  Got the Executioner and it was great.  Good prices and a fun place to eat.  This isnt a chain resteraunt and has a lot of charm to it."}
{"text":"My dad stays In Boulder City and man when he took me here I was astonished. I had seen Public Enemy and already new about John Dillinger, so the first time passing by and seeing the name \"Dillanagers\" I new it was about to be lit; you should know already that the mob ran Vegas. The best part to me was the menu having the name's of the meal's after mobster's. Great theme with historic facts about the mob and their lives. Local town place and they have the best food."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and excellent service. Food was great too!!  Loved the sweet potato fries!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and the Burgers Are Terrific! Especially the triple meat Dillinger.  The Asian type slaw is very tasty, the fries and onion rings are a must try as well. Overall a wonderful eatery!"}
{"text":"I stopped in with a friend while visiting.  The decor is fun and fits the name.  Great addition to Boulder. The wait staff was attentive, and the food was great.  I thoroughly enjoyed my Chicken with a Twist wrap.  I will make a return visit next time I am in Boulder City."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how many of my readers regularly go out to Boulder City, but Vegas seems to be one of those places that everyone wants to visit. Tourists typically want to see the Hoover Dam so I've definitely made my way in this direction many times in the years I've lived here. Besides, Boulder actually has a cool little scene going on and The Dillinger is a bar I wish was located downtown around some of my other favorite spots. Since they opened, the folks at The Dillinger have been tweeting me to come try their burger. It took me a few months to actually make my way there, but now that I have I can say it was definitely worth the wait.  The Dillinger is a cool looking place, and I'm not just saying that because a friend was involved with its development. You notice this as soon as you try to walk in the doors when you grab the shotgun door handles. Inside there is a bar with about 8-10 seats, and a few tables around the perimeter. The finishes are kind of rustic and Old West, with signs and photos on the walls to match. We initially sat inside at the only open table, but quickly decided that we would rather be outside since it was far too loud in there and it was beautiful out. There were only maybe 25 people in there, but it sounded worse. Our waitress even mentioned that it was louder than usual and she had a hard time hearing us.  The menu has a lot of great sounding sandwiches and salads, as well as a very large and constantly changing beer selection, but I was here to sample their featured gourmet burgers. Many of them sounded delicious, and luckily I was there with someone else which allowed me the opportunity to get a sample of a second one. I went with their signature Dillinger burger, which comes with cheddar, apple wood smoked bacon and beef brisket. I was nervous after another experience I've had with brisket in a burger, but stuck with it in the hopes that this would work out.  And it did. The meat had really great flavor, although it was cooked much more than the medium-rare than I ordered it was still quite juicy. The bun was soft yet flaky, and very good. But the star in this burger was the brisket; it was tender, extremely juicy and had fantastic flavor. The bun to meat ratio was a tiny bit off, but the extra bit of bun I had at the end was very welcome as it was coated with tasty brisket grease and also had a bit of a crisp texture from the griddle.  Since I mentioned it, the second burger was the Baby Face Nelson, which comes with baked Brie, mixed greens and fig marmalade. It had the same great bun and great meat flavor. The Brie was a very good-sized chunk although it wasn't quite melted enough for my taste. The marmalade was very sweet and delicious, combined with the mixed greens the burger was an overall great assembly of a 'healthy' burger alternative.  My regular fries were slightly typical but still very good and cooked well. The sweet potato fries that we ordered with the other burger were also very good. Overall both of our meals were excellent, and I was very satisfied with driving 30+ minutes to try it out. All of the burgers on the menu are in the $8-12 range which is more than an acceptable price for what you get; the total for our meal which included two burgers, an iced tea and a beer was around $33. I have spent almost as much for just myself for far less quality, so this was a welcome meal. The only major problem I have with this meal is how far I will have to drive to eat there again, but in my opinion it's worth it. I will note that while we were sitting inside our waitress was very attentive, but as soon as we stepped outside with the other three seated tables we almost never saw her other than when she delivered our food. In fact, when we got our bill she took so long to come back out that I gave up and went inside to pay. Not the end of the world, but something to note if you chose the outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Great place!!! Manager was kind and  generous gift for hubby bday! Great bday night out!!"}
{"text":"As a local in BC I was surprised that another \"burger\" joint would be so wonderful.  I've eaten almost everything on the menu so far and it's all been so yummy.  They have super cold beer and a nice bar selection.  One of my fav's is the Steak Salad and the chopped salad.  I love the artichoke and chicken fingers spicy are fantastic.  I don't know what I can say but this place is a must."}
{"text":"The Best - Best burger ever, sayeth my husband and I have to agree. We both had \"The Dillinger\" and it was scrumptious. Came with salad or fries or for another buck you could have sweet potato fries instead (watch though, they taste like they have sugar on them! Didn't like at first but since they were there, you nibble on them, right?! The taste kinda grew on me and I began to compare them with the taste of a doughnut!).        The plate was rounded out with slice of fresh tomato, lettuce, and hmm, forget now but I ate it so it was good! We had plans to try the cheesecake for dessert but after the stick calamari as an appetizer and then the hamburger, oh, and the beer, there just wasn't any room!       Can't forget to mention the delicious craft beer choices on the menu.  There were several good ones there and if we'd come earlier, it would have been good to sit at a table outside and eat, while going through the different craft beers. We forgot to check to see if he/she had an option of trying 5 or 6 small glasses as a sample.       DEFINITELY THE PLACE to come and relax, enjoy a superb meal and drink while in Boulder City.  We'll definitely be back on our way through again next October/November.  From one citizen of BC (British Columbia) to another BC resident (Boulder City)! Well done!"}
{"text":"The Dillinger is a welcome addition to the Boulder City eatery scene.  Most draft beers are only $4.50 and on Wednesdays (all day) and during happy hour PBR's are only a dollar.  And they are COLD.  Great menu.  All of the burgers can be ordered with a veggie pattie.  The fries have to be the best (or close to it) in the World.  Friendly people working there."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. Best burgers you can get in Boulder City, hands down. Creative menu and friendly staff"}
{"text":"Always an amazing experience. Baby face Nelson is the best burger ever! Brie cheese on a burger is incredible!"}
{"text":"Good place. Good food. Good service well be back for sure. The burger was huge and my coleslaw had nice flavor. Very cool decor and just a great vibe."}
{"text":"I am a burger freak!  I love trying new burgers!  I NOW HAVE A NEW FAVORITE BURGER!!  The Dillinger is a very friendly place with a great menu featuring many unique burgers and sandwiches. The staff was very friendly.  The atmosphere is very interesting featuring items centered around famous criminal John Dillinger, even down to the 40's and 50's automobiles parked outside.lot's of subtle details make it an interesting place to eat.  Now, about this burger!!  I had the namesake burger, The Dillinger Burger.  It features a nice thick patty with cheese then topped with some beef brisket that has been cooked in a very nice, sweet but tangy, BBQ sauce.  A lot of places try this but fail because the brisket overpowers the burger.  Not at The Dillinger!  It was perfect!!  Just the right amount to add but not overwhelm the taste of the burger.  The bun was soft bread that was also delicious!  The sweet potato fries were also very well done.  My problem is there are many other burgers on their menu that I would love to try and I'm only here for a week!  Guess I'm gonna have to go back to The Dillinger again tonight!!"}
{"text":"I had one of the best chicken sandwiches! It was the Firehouse Chicken, yummy!  I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Good local stop on way back from Hoover dam. Service was attentive, food reasonably price, good portions, and clean environment. Had lunch. The chicken wrap and chicken finger sandwich were both good. Fries were well seasoned and large quantity given."}
{"text":"I have The Baron when I go here,  it is absolutely a perfect burger, The onion rings are great,  I have never had a bad experience there.   Keep in mind this is a bar that sells food, not the 4 seasons, the wait staff are friendly and competent and everyone is friendly    I take the kids and they have plenty of options for them too."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and veggie burger on a short trip away from vegas. Worth heading off the main highway!! Cindy is the best. Ask for her"}
{"text":"The best food I have had in a long time. Gourmet burgers at a good price. The food is fantastic never frozen beef,freshly made burgers and sides. It's become a regular place for myself and family. It's a bit small but you don't mind waiting. The owner shows up frequently, treat you like family as do the staff. Won't go anywhere else for a good burger! The Babyface Nelson is the best!!!"}
{"text":"Don't know why the place was so crowded at lunch. Food mediocre and waitress has no personality. Reasonable prices, though."}
{"text":"This is one of my go to restaurants in Boulder City. Everything is always delicious, but I recommend the chopped salad and Baby Face Nelson burger with a side of sweet potato French fries. I get them almost every time. I like that I can choose indoor or outdoor dining and that dogs are allowed outside. The outside has misters and heaters, so it is open all year. The service is always excellent and the manager usually stops by the table to make sure that everything is good. Make sure you check out the tropical salt scrub in the bathroom. It smells amazing and is a really nice touch."}
{"text":"Nothing surprising here except a 50 cent charge for ranch dressing with my fries.  Maui Howie is not use to such abuse.  Buyers are okey.... ketchup is complimentary thankfully."}
{"text":"After having read about The Dillinger in Las Vegas Weekly, I decided to make it my final stop on our day trip to Boulder City.  Off the main drag of Nevada, it's located on the up-and-coming Arizona Street across from the Boulder Dam Hotel.  The Dillinger has a great atmosphere with rifles as door handles, bullets in the tables, and friendly service.  There's a tiny bar with a small, but interesting beer selection.  Expect to pay about $6 for a draft.  They have a more upscale menu than a typical restaurant/bar.  My husband ordered the veggie burger and liked it.  I ordered the portabella burger and it was....not so good.  The portabella needed a chance to drip-dry a bit before being put on the bun.  Instead it sweated itself out on the bun and made the bottom slice of bread inedible.  The mushroom itself also lacked flavor (the toppings were good, however) and eventually the sandwich made my stomach feel icky.  I left about half of it.  The fries are really good though, so make sure you order those!  It's very small inside, so if you plan on being there on a busy night try to get in early.  Also, while we had friendly service, it was very slow.    In the end, it wasn't as great as I was hoping it would be but I would give it another shot when I'm back in Boulder City.  Props for hosting lots of bands and local musicians on a near-daily basis."}
{"text":"I haven't been able to find a steak salad I like better than the one here, which is a pain because this place is so far from me.  But it's dynamite and the home made blue cheese dressing can't be beat. The service is fast, and Dan the manager is genuinely friendly in a non fake way. Oh.... and I love how now I can order a half salad so that I can also get like an appetizer too."}
{"text":"The Dillinger is very important if you want some good eats in Boulder City NV. When my family goes, they get food I would recommend it, they were very good looking. Whenever I go, I get the Hot wings an the Cheese Steak sandwich. They give you a choice of plain, mild and hot. They also give you a tiny bowl of ranch or Blue Cheese, with celery that you can scoop out the rest of dip and wing sauce. The Chesse Steak is big and greasy. They have a kind of shredded Steak they top it with peppers and onions, and cheese. All in all, The Dillinger is worth eating at."}
{"text":"Ok so my friend and I stopped in for some chicken fingers and a drink while the kids painted at Ruben's Toy Shop. Greeted and served at the bar right away. Drink was good but we waited 20 minutes and no chicken fingers. 3 tables were seated and served I let the staff/ owner know  we were waiting. He came back from the kitchen after 4 min and said they were almost done and that the ticket was only turned in 9 minutes before...uh ok ..so someone forgot to put in order but there was no apology and when they finally did bring them in a take out container , still no apology or acknowledgement that we waited a long time. Plus there was no ranch or blue cheese included with the order. My friend was no longer hungry after that experience so I don't know if they taste good or not."}
{"text":"This place and is fantastic!! The food was great all 3 of of us ordered something different and it was all great. The peach bread pudding is a must for desert!"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, cold beer. Perfect mix for a Saturday afternoon lunch. :)"}
{"text":"After touring the cities antique stores yesterday.. my husband said, let's get a bit to eat and have a drink before we head home. So we had heard of this little spot that had good food and the most friendliest service in town. \"WOW\" that news we heard was completely incorrect... we walked in no greeting from the two female server/bartenders and no direction to sitting as they were to busy on their cell phones and a IPAD and a gentleman at the end of the bar.. (had to be a regular) as they catered to him and spent a lot of time talking to him instead of providing customer service. We decided to sit at the bar and my husband had to say we would like to order drinks and see the menu as they didn't even ask what we would like as we sat down. We reviewed the menu and placed our order. As we placed our order of the Philly Cheesesteak the server didn't ask which cheese we wanted as the menu gave u options so my husband said don't u want to know what cheese we want she said no it's a given everyone wants provolone.. which we didn't but that is what we got.. our drinks were almost gone and never was asked if we wanted another round like MOST bartenders would have asked.. once our food came out the server shoves the plate in My husbands hand to take. No extra napkins, ketchup or salt n pepper which u think we would have gotten since we had the philly with fries... But, we did get a pickle that looked as if it was left out for days.. (see pic) Mmmmm during the whole visit we never were asked if we need anything else. This was the worst experience we have had in this town and warn others to NOT visit this establishment until they train or hire servers/bartenders that can be welcoming and make ur customers feel like wanted guest!!!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best house salad I have ever had. If I lived here I would come every day just for this salad. Great wait staff as well."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Restaurant is in a cool little historic part of Boulder City.  Wife had Philly steak sandwich.  It was good.  I had the executioner burger. Great! Side of sweet potato fries also great.  Nice beers on tap.  Would definitely go back.  Great option to break away from crazy Vegas strip or as part of a day trip to Hoover dam like us."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while now.  My husband and I stopped in for dinner on a Friday night and took a table outside, even in December, the outdoor heaters kept it quite comfortable. I swim at Lake Mead and ride my bike there fairly often, so I was glad to learn they are also open for lunch.  We both ordered the brisket sandwich, very good - the horseradish sauce could have had a little more of a kick but that is really nitpicking.   Service couldn't have been any friendlier or more efficient - even sitting outside we were well taken care of. We will be back to try some of their awesome-sounding burgers and the veggie sandwich."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service, I'd highly recommend this place to anyone in the area! Delicious burgers!"}
{"text":"Great service! Nice old school looking bar/ restaurant . Has a good old west theme to it. The bartender that served me is named savannah. She was very friendly and good looking. :) The drinks are priced well and the food is excellent. Especially if you order the Dillinger burger. Will not disappoint. If you are in town stop by. Worth the trip if you are looking for a relaxed small bar/ restaurant"}
{"text":"Nous avons fait étape à Boulder juste avant notre arrivée à Vegas. Nous avions sélectionné la ville au hasard sur la carte et nous n'avons pas été déçus ! Nous sommes allés diner au Dillinger car il y avait un concert sur la terrasse et l'ambiance était fort sympathique, au hasard j'ai pris le burger \"Dillinger\" il reste aujourd'hui encore parmi mes trois burgers favoris au monde ! Service au top, ambiance géniale et burger dans les annales, je vous recommande vivement ce restaurant si vous faites étape dans le coin !"}
{"text":"My husband and I stumbled upon The Dillinger one day about 8 months ago after going into the antique store next door.  We saw the shot guns on the door and had to check it out... Conveniently the place is all about burgers and so are we...  The food is out of this world... The burgers are THE best I've had at ANY restaurant, hands down, no exaggeration.  The meat is fresh daily from the butcher across the street.  The wings are to die for... also my favorite anywhere around Vegas... meaty and juicy.  Try them Scotty Style (tossed in buffalo sauce then thrown back on and blackened)... you won't regret it.  I always order a side of the Parmesan vinaigrette as EVERYTHING tastes even better dipped in it.   Service is always very good... the girls are sweet and just chatty enough.  They pour a great drink and you can't beat the prices especially $1 PBRs during happy hour and all day on Wednesday.  The manager, Dan, is a great guy... he always lets us know what is new and makes sure we are satisfied.  Grant, the owner, really knows what he is doing with the place, food, staff, etc.  We make the drive from Henderson once a week, if not more.  It's worth it..."}
{"text":"We were starving after taking a Hoover Dam tour and decided to try this place out. It's a cozy bar scene in downtown Boulder City. I had a burger called the Dillinger which was absolutely delicious. If you want a cheap beer to relax, they've got $2 PBRs all the time and they're $1 on Wednesdays. The service was friendly and fast. Highly recommended place if you're looking for something low key and tasty."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. Fantastic food and great beer on tap. I've never had any meal at Dillingers that was less than awesome. I'd recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Fantastic choice of burgers, and all of them delicious  (And I've actually tried them all- admittedly the PB was not my favorite, but still yummy.)Staff is always friendly, even when they're busy on weekend nights with live music. The owner is always there, helpful, and making sure the customer is having a great experience.  It's my personal favorite of the restaurant/bar options in town, and the one I take my friends to."}
{"text":"I have had very pleasurable experiences at The Dillinger. Great atmosphere. They have a killer burger and you cant beat $1.00 PBR's on Wednesday's.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The Firehouse Chicken Sandwich ~ is the BOMB! Paired up with a cold one off their great Beer List! You won't be disappointed - it's worth the trip. I had lived in Boulder City for many years but, am now a resident of Henderson. I love what The Dillinger has brought to the Boulder City community ~ annual block parties, great food and beverages. I do have to say, in the past their waitress service was nothing to rave about but, I've gone twice in the past two weeks. Service has most definitely improved ~ ladies you were great! Just wish I would have inquired their names to include them on this Yelp. No worries, I most definitely will be back for date night!!!"}
{"text":"Love their burgers! This is easily one of my top 5 places to get a burger. Nice place, good service, good prices."}
{"text":"I am giving such a low rating because the bartenders were not very nice:( especially Amy we will NOT be coming back she should really find another profession!!"}
{"text":"This place is tight like prom night.  The food is the bomb.  Seafood bisque could be one of the best I've ever had.  Great selection of beer and the mixed drinks are fantastic.  Bartender is super nice.  Get out of Vegas and come to Dillinger."}
{"text":"Stopped here after a visit to the Dam & it did not disappoint!  My party ordered the tuna sandwich, The Capone, The Dillinger, and the Execution burgers. All were excellent.   My favorite part had the be the appetizer though, a FriKin' Pickle! Deep fried pickle wrapped in ham & Swiss...you cant go wrong there!!"}
{"text":"Loved the feel of the place inside and out. Owner has worked very hard to give it that local historic atmosphere with today's style. Prices were not over the top. Food was great! It's small inside. Not alot of seating so you can tend to wait. I liked this place and would tell others....however there were only two waitresses ( the place is small) and we seemed to get the one having the bad day or the  poor personality. I hope when we return she's not there or  having a better day."}
{"text":"Great Burgers!!!   Great Sevice!!!!  Great Music!!!  Went for hubby's birthday because Justin Mather was playing....it was our first time here and we were completely thrilled with this little bar and grill!!!    We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Average bar/grill food, decent (not great) prices. Wouldn't go out of my way to stop here to eat- don't understand all of the hype on Yelp."}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers; cooked the way you like it (I like MR), and the nice option of a whole wheat bun. The fries are excellent, but sometimes a little salty.  The only downside is that sometimes the service is slow. I don't know how they assign sections, but we've had up to three different servers take care of us on one visit and none of them knew what the others were doing, so refills, follow up, and getting our check was slow. Not really coordinated.  But if you're in the mood for a burger, this is the only place to go in Boulder City."}
{"text":"Wonderful start to a nice lazy sunday brunch. Came here for lunch and enjoyed the outdoors. Nice seating outside and heating lamps to keep you watm if it's chilly outside.  I had to get the baby face nelson hamburger that had fig jam and brie. The hamburger is large and super filling. Beef patty is cooked perfectly, it's super juicy and tender.  I also substituted the fries with sweet potato fries which are seasoned with cinnamon sugar. Delicious. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Passing through Boulder City, a really nice place to visit (I especially liked the art which lines the streets), on our way from Flagstaff to Las Vegas we had lunch here. A friendly staff made us feel more than welcome. The food was very tasty and the portions more then generous making us long for more. If we decide to visit the Hoover dam we'll certainly return here.  Oh and the door handles are most likely the best I've ever seen!"}
{"text":"LOVE Dillingers! The staff is also extremely friendly and they have the best fries around! Seriously, sometimes I just crave their fries! Drinks are good, great atmosphere and amazing burgers."}
{"text":"Yum yum! Such a good burger joint and a true hidden gem off the beaten path. The Dilinger burger is a mess of a burger but totally worth every calorie and sloppiness. A cute little local hot spot that was full when we arrived which made us feel good about being there."}
{"text":"Great burgers. Great beers. Great service.   Burger styles just unique enough from each other that you'll have a different experience every time. I've been there twice, having the Dillinger and the Capone. Loved them both. Can't wait to try a different one next time.   And for vegetarians, I suggest you do what my date did. She ordered the portabella burger with baked brie. Yum!"}
{"text":"I give the burgers a 4 star. They were cooked well and had great flavor. I was very disappointed in the sides; they were all frozen food. That's why I only give this place an overall 3 star. If you're going to take that much effort with the burgers go ahead and make good sides....it's not that much extra effort or cost."}
{"text":"Went today for the first time with my wife,we live in Henderson and I had bookmarked this spot awhile back and we decided to finally try it ! I got the \"Bugsy\" burger , basically a bacon and cheddar burger with grilled onions and my wife got a burger with Pastrami on it! Don't remember the name but they are prepared Medium unless you request a different temp.  We both agreed these were the best burgers we've had since moving to Henderson 3 1/2 years ago! Can't believe we waited so long to try this place! The burgers were juicy and cooked perfectly! My wife liked her onion rings and my fries were good but all I keep thinking about is that awesome bacon cheeseburger ! Super cold draft beer too!  We will be regulars moving forward!"}
{"text":"Excellent spot for good food and casual ambiance.  Service was great, Gouda app was delish, burger and sandwich were delicious!"}
{"text":"3 stars for good food & cheap drinks, plus 1 more star for great service!  -onion rings were yum! -Chinese chicken salad was good & big enough for 2 -friendly & attentive servers -comfortable atmosphere   I live in Las Vegas and came out here for the live music. I would definitely make the trip back and make The Dillinger one of my stops!"}
{"text":"Lovvve this amazingly cool and friendly restaurant / bar! Props goes to Amy, the most efficient and fun bartender in Boulder City! She's a hoot! Great burgers, salads and beer!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in Nevada. One of the best burgers in Nevada.  The staff is always friendly and the food is amazing.  Well worth the visit.  I recommend the Dillinger burger."}
{"text":"exceptional experience. Burgers were cooked just right, Dillinger and Baby Face tastes were delicious. great service too. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I love it here. Hidden gem for those outside of Boulder City. I'm constantly telling people they need to go out there and check it out. This place has an awesome chill vibe. By far my favorite get away out there for a yummy burger, or salad."}
{"text":"Service was descent. No complaints there. Macaroni cheese bite appetizer (had 1 time before) was yummy. As for the burgers, both were overcooked and not that good. 45 special well done burger was almost burnt. Medium Bugsy burger was medium well to almost well. Prices are a bit higher than on the website but still not bad."}
{"text":"Really awesome burgers, not awesome service.  We came here after a day at the hoover dam. It is a bar and restaurant right in the middle of town with a good amount of street parking nearby. We got several different burgers and I opted for The Dillinger. The burgers were all really good but the service was only so so. My fiancé's burger was missing the bacon she ordered and I never got my soda. The waitress/bartender was alone so that could have been part of it, but it really wasn't that busy. I do recommend The Dillinger as it was quite unique."}
{"text":"Very nice place great food great service  Amy was perfect very knowledgable about the history of Boulder City"}
{"text":"Nice feeling , Way Cool décor , and the service was great  Very nice to just sit and have lunch after a good Sunday ride."}
{"text":"Best downtown BC restaurant hands down. The place is small and a little dark but the burgers are exceptional, the beer is cold and the service is welcoming. We get the calamari sticks (wonderful cocktail sauce) and the smoked Gouda man n' cheese bites for apps. I would recommend the sticky burger (peanut butter) or the firehouse chicken sandwich (spicy). They do need to figure out a better dessert than cheese cake but the place has a great vibe and is perfect any night of the week. It is a must stop and try whenever visiting BC."}
{"text":"We stopped here after some light exploring and it was just time for lunch and beer. The inside was pretty dark and it was so nice out we sat on the patio. Atmosphere was excellent with good jams and people have good conversation. We checked out the menu and the beer list and settled on the black bean burger,. And salad and some onion rings. Clearly we were hungry. On top of it I grabbed a beer that was perfect. They have a long list so I'm sure you can find something you'll enjoy. The food was on point and better than expected by far. This was upscale bar food I guess you could say. But it didn't even feel like that. There was a bit of extra quality to it I think. We were happy and the service was friendly as well. I would stop by again if I found myself in the area and hungry."}
{"text":"Great find. Everything was very delicious. Cheesecake was amazing. So glad we stopped on our way to Vegas."}
{"text":"Nice place. The service was super and the beer was cold. Nice selection I might add.  The waitress was very attentive and knew the menu. I had 'The Dillinger' burger. Cheddar, bacon and topped with their fab brisket. I ordered it medium (pink) it came out well done. Kinda dry but still tasty none the less. My wife had the seafood bisque...I know this sounds dumb, but it smelled way too fishy. The bisque was super rich/creamy and had a great flavor.   I may have added a fourth star but the burger was way overdone. BTW, they have live entertainment. Check their web site for details."}
{"text":"With an antiques shop around the corner, I get asked a lot about where to eat. I open The Country Register to our BC Dining Guide, and ask what kind of food they are craving... (there are many specialties)  As soon as they say \"how about a great burger?\", I point to The Dillinger, because this is a place you will remember the first burger you had there for probably the rest of your life and it will set the standard from then on! At least it has for my son and I... whenever we have a burger anywhere out of BC, this is what we rate it against!"}
{"text":"The food here was the bomb! I got the Dillinger burger and the Mrs. got the Executioner, we split both burgers so we could each try half and I think the executioner was better (but it's on sourdough and I'm a sucker for sourdough so that might be why)"}
{"text":"After an amazing sightseeing visit along Lakeshore Drive, we stopped by The Dillinger to relax and enjoy a well-deserved meal. We were lucky enough to get the last table inside and we were pleased to be in a cool spot, out of the burning sun.   Our burgers were awesomely stupendous.  I had the Baby Face Nelson, with brie, greens, and fig marmalade! Yum! My wife had The Dillinger, which included both bacon and brisket! Double Yum!  Combine with beer and life was definitely good!"}
{"text":"The burger was wonderful! The capone burger!The fries are great the food is fresh the atmosphere is quaint! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"We loved it . Very small and nice inside . Would recommend to anyone and looking forward to going back.  The service was spot on and everyone was really nice ! Great selection of food and drinks !   My wife had the Philly Cheesesteak with cheese sauce and onion rings ! The onion rings were nice and crispy and after a bite did not fall apart ! Perfect for dipping! Her sandwich was amazing with a nice roll and very big !   I had the Dillinger with a medium rare burger topped with BBQ brisket and onion , tomato and lettuce ! A little on the messy side but perfectly cooked ! Loved it   We also shared an appetizer that was incredible ! A pickle spear wrapped in Ham and Cheese and deep fried in a won ton wrapper ! Super yummy ... thanks so much for a great experience!"}
{"text":"While traveling through Boulder City, we stopped to have lunch 7/15/15.  We were more than surprised with the quality of food and drink.  Since this was a Wednesday, my husband had $1.00 draft beer.  Our sandwiches were large and we could have shared our plates.  Seasoned french fries were some of the best we have ever tasted.  I had a glass of White Sangria.  The owner even shared her recipe for the Sangria.  Best service we have had in a long time.  We highly recommended this place to our friends and family who live in Las Vegas.  We will be a repeat customer next time we are in Boulder City. NV."}
{"text":"Burger was fantastic!  Sweet potato fries cooked perfectly.  The macaroni&cheese bites were to die for! Best meal we've had since arriving 3 days ago,  including the fancy steak joints.  Loved them, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I had been anxious to visit the Dillinger.  Since we were on our way through Boulder it was the perfect time.  You walk into what looks like a locals dive bar that's been around for ages.  It's clean and modern mixed with historic and classic.  Strange but true.    In my mind you can't come to the Dillinger and not order the Dillinger right? So that's what I did.  Their menu description states it's 'Dangerously Good'.  I would have to agree.  The tender beef brisket and smoky bacon on the burger is genius.  Something that seems so simple but mouth watering.  The crinkle cut sweet potato fries really put a smile on my face.  Perfectly done!   Since I was splitting the burger with my husband, we also ordered the nachos.  Well these were philly style nachos with shaved beef, onions, peppers and jalapeño jack cheese.  I believe it was their cheese that turned me off.  If you're from Philly I'm sure you love 'Whiz' on your sandwiches.  It just didn't taste good on the nachos and would pass on this appetizer next time.    Service was fine during our visit.  I'd definitely come back for the burger.  Their menu lists some other unique and creative burgers that I should definitely try."}
{"text":"Best burger in town, I love the staff there, and the place is fun to hang out at in the evening."}
{"text":"Best burgers in Southern Nevada. Relaxing day in Boulder City walking in town and shopping the antique stores and driving around the neighborhood streets. Dillingers is the spot for food and great burgers. Service is good and $1 PBR draft happy hours are awesome. Las Vegas resident and taking the ride here is a getaway. Great place!"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch and cold beer, need I say more?  Downtown Boulder City and great lunch or dinner stop off.. Food and service is excellent!"}
{"text":"Diving right in and getting to the food part of this review first because I have to say The Dillinger Food and Drinkery serves up some dang good burgers. Possibly the best here in Clark County!  Their burgers here are quality  1/2 pound patties, Top Round and charbroiled to your liking. seasoned well, cooked just right, (one med rare, other well done) and juicy! Patties were a good size too!    We ordered the top two requested burgers The Dillinger and Baby Face Nelson.  \"The Dillinger\" Burger is topped Brisket, Applewood Smoked Bacon, and cheddar cheese. This one was freaking awesome!  I took a lil bite of Mr. B.'s burger. The bacon was crisp.The brisket was so tender and moist. Really good brisket, it had the right amount of mild bbq sauce mixed in. Mr. B kept saying it's the best one he's had.    \"Baby Face Nelson\" Burger is topped with a hunk of baked brie cheese, mixed greens and a fig marmalade spread. It felt like a healthier kind of burger. Less calories in brie vs cheddar and fig vs mayo based spreads right??? Anyways the combo of these ingredients went very well with the burger. Even the bun was pretty good.    The burgers comes with your choice of sides of fries or Asian style cole slaw.  Additional charge if you want onion rings or sweet potato fries. I love the Asian style slaw.There was sesame oil in the dressing.  Clam chowder was the SOTD. Not the best but pretty good.    And you know I had to peek at what others were having around us!  The Fire Roasted Artichoke that couple was having at the table next to us looked real yummy to me! They said they liked the smoked tomato chipotle aioli sauce they were dipping the artichokes into. Omg Im ordering this next time.  Oh they have craft beers. Dog Fish Head...I know some of you guys who like it. Well it's here.   Did you know this building use to be a bank from the '40s? Hence why the place is themed and named after the legendary bank robber John Dillinger.  Price wise not bad at all. For the two of us it was around $30 for our entrees, a cup of soup and drinks. That's pretty affordable to me.   The place was packed inside. So I only saw the inside of this place for a brief moment. Space wise not that big but roomy enough for everyone dining in there. It's an old building still has the original brick walls and vintage Bank of Nevada sign on the wall. The bar is in the center and a few tables surround the area.    We sat out front since all the tables and even the bar area inside was all occupied. There were vacant tables lined down the front of restaurant. Fun people watching and chatting with those who walk past by.   They take reservations so if you plan on coming during the peak lunch and dinner hours I would call them.  We were there around 3pm on Friday and a holiday so it was busy.   Service was great! Everyone was friendly. Our orders were taken right away and food brought out in a timely manner. The owner made the rounds and checked up on everyone.   I love just the overall small town charm of Boulder City and local owned restaurants like this one just enhance it even more. We're already have plans for another date lunch here!"}
{"text":"Fun, fun place to drink, dance, and listen to music.  Came here after the Wurst fest and they had a band, score!  The place was rocking!  The bartenders were friendly and the drinks were strong.  They have a burger called the Executioner.  How can this place not be cool?"}
{"text":"Good location in B.C.  Outdoor seating with warmers or cooling fans.    Nice descriptive menu with lots of burger choices.   In fact, the descriptions are so well written that their food seems to fall just short that. Liked the Asian Cole slaw.  Good service and dog friendly."}
{"text":"The server was extremely kind, and greeted us immediately, the margarita was wonderfully made, we had cream of spinich soup which was delicious and the overall atmosphere was extremely pleasant and enjoyable. A great stop for good looking burgers great drinks and good customer service. Ask for ashley!"}
{"text":"Cool location, friendly staff, great menu, but lacking in the execution. Halloween celebration included live music and a costume contest, prize being a PBR guitar- interesting and unique.  Most unique-sounding burger: Baby Face Nelson! Great quality meat, well-seasoned but undercooked (medium arrived rare), two thin and dismal slices of brie were overpowered by the generous amount of gritty fig marmalade. Adding onions to this burger mellowed out the overall taste profile a bit. Good quality but proportions were off in the dish.  Clam chowder side was not my thing: found the dish bland, waitress brought over salt and pepper with the dish. BF liked it, large chunks of clam were appreciated, but overall I can't say I'd order it again.  Service was friendly throughout visit. Love their promotion of the Rouge Farms Pumpkin Patch Ale- though at $7.50/pint, it's not cheap but love seeing it on tap."}
{"text":"This a a great little place. It's small, and a little loud, but the food is excellent! We went 2 nights in a row while staying at lake mead, they were able to sit us right away with 6 people. Probably not the case on the weekend though, place looks pumping. My husband and son LOVED the Dillinger burger."}
{"text":"We came to Boulder City to go to the art fair. It was a beautiful day and we thought we would take advantage of the fact that we could go to the Dillinger for an early dinner and eat outside. We were in luck. We only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. The weather was perfect. Sitting on the porch in front of the restaurant having a beer and a burger with friends is just about as close to perfection as you can get. I opted to have the portobella mushroom sandwich. I got it with brie cheese melted on it. It came with grilled onion and tomatoes as well. Orgasmically delicious!! My wife and our friends each had more traditional hamburgers. The hamburgers are a half  pound of freshly ground beef that is hand pattied in the restaurant. My wife and friends each raved about their hamburgers. The service was also spectacular. Our server, Amy, was outstanding. Warm and friendly with a great sense of humor. And she was very attentive to our table. Ambiance, service, and food - all excellent. The Dillinger earned its 5 star rating."}
{"text":"Good eats, friendly staff, cozy atmosphere and craft beers. If you like your burger with brisket & bacon, The Dillinger is highly recommended.   So do yourself a favor and stop by if you're ever in BC. And try to make room for the bread pudding."}
{"text":"Awesome service.  great food. spent the first portion of a sat night here and the bartender was very friendly and provided awesome service.  the phily cheese fries were amazing.  the atmosphere is dark but nice.... like an old 1920s bar!"}
{"text":"This was my 3 rd visit to The Dillinger. I like supporting local establishments but this will be the last visit.  The food was under cooked, rare, and I asked to have it cooked more. The burger came back charred and burned, bun burned, bacon extra crispy burned. The cook didn't need to do that. On an earlier visit the service was poor, we sat seated for 10 minutes waiting for our order to taken after being given menus,  the server sat at bar and talked with co workers. We were no more than 6 ft away. We walked out. Prior visit, food cold and tortilla wrap soggy, had been sitting for awhile before being brought out."}
{"text":"We both had a great burger here! Moreover, the bread pudding was a nice desert. The people are friendly and the menu card is just hilarious."}
{"text":"We went to The Dillinger based on a recommendation we received.  We will definitely be back!  The service was excellent and the food was delicious!!  I loved The Bonnie Melt!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came to Boulder City on an antique shop-hopping day. We stopped for lunch here at The Dillinger and sat outside on their sidewalk patio, only other seating seemed to be inside the bar. I ordered The Executioner, which was an unbelievable melted burger inside delicious sourdough bread. My husband ordered the BBQ Beef Brisket Sandwich which he said was good but a little too much sauce for his taste. Good restaurant, not very kid friendly due to seating limitations. Will return for that burger again!"}
{"text":"Going back home to Arizona from Las Vegas. We were so hungry!  With so many places to choose from, I'm so glad we stopped here!  It was a little spot with no cars outside. We were a little hesitant to go in cuz it was empty!  But, thank goodness we did because the food was amazing!!"}
{"text":"The Dillinger is the perfect place for a bite to eat and a cold beer. The food has never let me down and the service has always been incredible. If your in Boulder City this is a must stop."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, friendly prompt service. Food was great. Decent prices. For desert I got some sort of chocolate thing with Thai basil ice cream. I was skeptical, but decided to try it out. It was AMAZING!! Defiantly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Super annoyed that I went way out of my way to go to this place only to find on the door a sign that says closed due to hangover. In the ten minutes we were sitting there trying to decide on a new place to go, at least 6 families walked up and walked away annoyed. Probably will never consider stopping again."}
{"text":"Best burgers in Vegas hands down!  Actually the restaurant is in Boulder city about 20-30 minutes from the strip but it is definitely worth the trip! We came on a Sunday afternoon and everything was delicious.  The restaurant is an old bank and has a lot of charm.  It still looks like a bank and the outside has shotguns for door handles (great photo op).  It is small inside but wasn't too busy. Our server was great and very attentive.  The burgers have fun bank robber names and interesting toppings.  Some have Asian slaw, brisket on top of a burger, and a fried egg.  I ordered The Capone which comes with jack and cheddar cheese, grilled onions, smoked applewood bacon and special sauce.  My friend ordered The Dillinger which is a burger topped with applewood smoked bacon and beef brisket.  We both got a side of the sweet potato fries.  Both burgers were amazing and so filling! Prices were great especially for the potion size (ranged from $8-$18 depending on what you order).  Definitely make the trip out to Boulder City to try this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers. I got \"the copone\" (the messy one) it was great! fries are so-so. The atmosphere is definitely small town feel, but its in a nice neighborhood so you don't feel like you are too far off the beaten path. A place where the older crowd likes to hang out. It wasn't too busy or too quiet when we ate there. Overall a great experience. The burger definitely made it worth the try."}
{"text":"We picked The Dillinger off the list because it sounded like an interesting theme for a restaurant. The bar has a very inviting vibe and the staff is super friendly. The food was reasonably priced and tasted amazing. The Dillinger should definitely go on your \"todo\" list when visiting Boulder City."}
{"text":"My family and I stopped here after visiting the Hoover Dam.  My wife had the BBQ Beef Brisket Sandwich and I had the Capone Burger.  I chose the Capone Burger over the Dillinger just because I thought I was going to taste my wife's brisket sandwich.  The Capone Burger was outstanding and I was looking forward to trying the Brisket Sandwich but my wife loved it so much, she didn't share.  The waitress or owner was so nice to bring me a little sample on the house of the brisket and now I can see why she didn't share.  My kids had the chicken strip meal and it was gone pretty quickly.  They liked it very much.  We highly recommend this place to anyone passing through."}
{"text":"Great to eat there and pick up to go. I usually place large orders when I take groups to tour Hoover Dam.  They make the best sandwiches in town. Even the vegetarian sandwich is amazing.    I call a couple of weeks in advance for my large orders.  Dan, Cindy, and the staff are always great and prepare everything on time."}
{"text":"I am from The central coast of California and was visiting a good friend in Henderson and we decided to go to Boulder for the day. We were walking around downtown and decided to stop into The Dillinger on a whim as we had seen it on previous trips to Boulder but never stopped in.   It was well worth the wait we had to get an inside table (it was a tad chilly out). The service was great and attentive, the food was excellent and well priced. And there was a nice ambiance! We will definitely stop back in the next time we are in Boulder!"}
{"text":"Super awesome burgers!!! A must to try! Nice and polite stuff in there, it was a pleasure to stop by, thank you guys."}
{"text":"Knowing local musicians introduces you to places you would never have discovered otherwise.   Our first time at The Dillinger was for a show that a couple of our friends played (Jesse Pino, Brock Frabbiele). We had already eaten, as we didn't know what to expect and wanted to play it safe.   A couple weeks later, we found out another performance would be there (The All Togethers), who we love and would definitely like to support... so, we got there a little before the posted show time and had dinner beforehand. We both got burgers, regular fries and a drink. I don't remember which burgers we had, but they were generous in size and VERY tasty.   Even though we were there mainly for the music, the servers never left us long periods without checking on us, which was a great bonus to the good food and good music!  I'm not sure if the place is really fit for live music, but it does fairly well. If you sit in the back, you will likely either have to strain to hear or not be able to hear clearly. Not sure if it's a sound guy issue or an equipment issue, but we have learned you need to sit somewhat close to get a decent sound. it would be awesome if this could be fine tuned to turn out a little better, but regardless, it's a good place to visit at least once to make up your own mind about them."}
{"text":"Just a tourist stopping for a good meal. The place didn't disappoint! Totally recommend! Great food, Great atmosphere. Indoor/outdoor seating for a casual experience"}
{"text":"My husband and I ventured out from Southwest Las Vegas to Boulder City in search of burgers from a new place. It's actually not that far considering we used to drive much further out to places in LA but something about living in Vegas makes driving further than 10 minutes oddly daunting.   Anyway, we drove a couple weeks ago, with thunderstorms rolling in to Lake Mead. The further out we drove, the darker the skies got and the brighter the lighting lit them. I started to think we made a stupid decision and wondered if our regrets would compound with a disappointing dinner.   Getting there is an experience. Street parking is rather plentiful.The surroundings look retro - almost Palm Springs-like  When we approached, I noticed the doors look like safe doors and the handles were fashioned after shotguns. The interior follows the mobster theme, as the menu with burgers named \"The Capone\", \"The Dillinger\", and so forth...   The dinner rush is rather active so you might find a short wait for seating. However, the staff is very friendly and quick to acknowledge new arrivals. I noticed they were very attentive about the seating situation and worked quickly to buss tables and get folks seated ASAP. Luckily for us, we walked in right as a table was just done being wiped down.   Service, as I mentioned, was quick and attentive. We were offered drinks almost immediately and never had to ask for refills.   As for the food...  We started with the nachos. I normally don't like cheese sauce but this sauce was good. The nachos were meatier than expected, which is always a good thing.   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-dillinger-boulder-city?select=w3Qp9GYUR7XnVoIOVOqdcA#w3Qp9GYUR7XnVoIOVOqdcA  My husband ordered the namesake Dillinger Burger, which is topped with cheddar, applewood smoked bacon, and beef brisket.   Now, here's the thing - we expected a good burger but we were completely blindsided to stumble upon a GREAT burger. From the first bites, we both looked at each other with large \"oh, yes, this is IT\" eyes. You can tell all of the details were carefully considered - the burger was cooked perfectly, the bun was toasted, warm, and held up to all the toppings, the bacon was smoky, and the brisket was moist and tangy with BBQ sauce. Oh, yeah, the BBQ was a happy surprise (makes sense in retrospect but we've had a lot of non-BBQ brisket and assumed that was what was coming).   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-dillinger-boulder-city?select=w3Qp9GYUR7XnVoIOVOqdcA#jTJ_2ptdsHGdi4lV5aWQSw  I ordered The Babyface Nelson, which is topped with baked brie, mixed greens, and fig marmalade. I loved it. That melted brie though... drool city. Again, it was a burger that was clearly well thought out and executed. This was probably the best fig marmalade I've had. I felt like I could taste it but that it wasn't overpoweringly sweet in any way.   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-dillinger-boulder-city?select=w3Qp9GYUR7XnVoIOVOqdcA#R3a9vSu4wneej7F47AyN0w  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-dillinger-boulder-city?select=w3Qp9GYUR7XnVoIOVOqdcA#Hy7k-NpuAjIy-FL3_dmgGA  The sides didn't get much attention but let's just say they matched burgers - great fries and onion rings!   For two, with tax and tip, we spent around $50 which we felt was well worth the meal and experience. With the burgers we ate, I'm determined to go back to try the others... next time, in better weather."}
{"text":"We ate here 2/23/14.  We had planned to stop and eat in the Coffee Cup but as usual there was a line out the door and we were short on time.  Walking in the door we were greeting by an extremely nice lady that I think was a server and the bar tender.   The place was empty which I thought was strange,  turns out they get more of the afternoon crowd.  By the time we finished eating the place was full.    I had the philly,  my only complaint would be the cheese sauce was very bland and didnt really add anything to the sandwich.  Would have been much better with the provolone.  The service was good but a little slow getting us the check,  but that's understandable since the whole place filled up so quickly and there was only 2 girls waiting tables.    The atmosphere and friendliness was enough for us to add this to our monthly rounds for eating out."}
{"text":"This was an excellent place to stop for a drink and lunch after our hike at Bootleg Canyon. Thanks Yelp!  It's small with some bar seating and a few tables, as well as a few tables outside. It's all seat yourself.   They felt a little under-staffed as the service wasn't exactly attentive or quick. But it was friendly.  There were several food and drink specials, as well as a decently lengthy menu. Everything sounded tasty. And I definitely appreciated the humor interlaced in the menu descriptions. \"No beer was harmed.\" They had some good local brews on tap, as well as some good bottles too.  We settled on a couple of appetizers. (But oh man did those burgers sound tasty!) We had the philly steak fries (a philly cheesesteak but on top of fries) and smoked gouda mac 'n' cheese bites with a fab tomato aioli. Both were filling and quite tasty. I particularly loved the fries. It was a delicious and unique take on a cheesesteak. And the mac 'n' cheese bites were definitely some of the best I've had.  It's got a nice vibe and ambiance. Minimalist and modern with some speakeasy and mob touches.  All in all, we will definitely come back again whenever in Boulder City."}
{"text":"Stopped here after seeing Hoover Dam with family. Went out of their way to accommodate our party despite being busy. The menu is humorous, and the food was great. The basics plus some interesting sandwiches and salads. Big portions."}
{"text":"Food was good nice, good  town feeling great place to see bands play on the weekends . Our experience , wish it was better after we ate we started to leave but found a seat out side were we could hear and see the band , not once were we asked if we wanted to have another drink. To the owner we enjoyed your place and if there was service , we would have spent a lot more !"}
{"text":"Not very good at all. I've been told by friends that the food was good. Maybe it was an off day, but I don't really believe that either. Nothing we ordered was good. Came for lunch...had macaroni cheese bites, completely gross...my husband and I had the steak sandwhich, don't think it was steak, more like mystery breaded meat with a terrible heavy mayo sauce. Daughter had a chicken wrap...it was ok, maybe. The fries were also super salty. The beer was good."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the location is nice. I had the Bonnie burger and Asian slaw and it was so good I almost ate the plate. This is definitely on my list of favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"If you're not in Boulder City and looking for a great place to eat, this place is worth the drive! That Dillinger burger is crazy good, fries are cooked perfect and those sweet potato fries are second to none! Great little restaurant with a gangster theme and a wonderful staff. You won't be disappointed if you make the trip to enjoy this gem. For desert try the bread pudding, you will thank me for it, trust me!!"}
{"text":"Ive been here a few times with a group of people and its a great spot to get a meal and hangout with friends. The service was alright. It does seem like a lot of people here are regulars since its a pretty small town. They are best knows for their burgers and so far I've tried a few and have liked them  a lot! one that surprised me a lot is their sticky burger its a peanut butter burger and its delicious! they also have wraps and sandwiches, soups & salads. They also have live music on weekends."}
{"text":"We went for a Sunday drive and wound up in Boulder City. Had beers, fries, sweet potato fries, Baby Face Nelson burger, and BLT (A). We were going to share, but ended up just wanting our respective choices. Everything was delicious in a cool atmosphere. Much better food than other options in the area."}
{"text":"The Dillinger is a very unique spot. Indoor and outdoor seating in downtown Boulder City and directly across from the historic Boulder Theatre.  This is where you go when you have a craving for a big and delicious hamburger after being disappointed at other places, even the one place you thought was your favorite. The Dillinger will be your favorite new spot.   Service is always good and fairly quick.  The burgers, salads, soups, and sandwiches are all excellent. Nice selection of beer and drinks available from their bar. The owner or manager usually checks with each table to see if everything is OK. Yes, everything is great at The Dillinger in Boulder City.    Worth a drive just to go here if you are from out of town, and then take a walk after your meal around downtown Boulder City. Parking is usually very easy downtown (look for the little parking lot areas, like in Hotel Plaza and the surrounding area) and prices are great for what you get."}
{"text":"This is a 2 part review: 1st) they were busy and we got seated right away which was nice. I had the cheese steak and it was delicious. Everyone at my table said the food was good which included the Executioner & Monster Chili burger. The food took a little while to come out but that's really nothing to complain about and 2nd) and by far the biggest part of this review is the fact that I left my very expensive sunglasses on our table when we left and 24 hours later when I got back home to San Diego and realized they were missing I called the restaurant and....... of course they had them!  So thanks to whoever bussed our table and did the right thing and to Amy to helped make sure the sunglasses were returned to me. You guys are AWESOME!!"}
{"text":"Quaint and cool little place in Boulder City.  We stopped here after seeing the dam. The whole table ordered burgers.   They were ok, not very big burgers. Nothing stood out of about them. The Dillinger that comes with the brisket on top was delicious. The brisket had good flavor.   Overall decent place to eat, and prices were ok. Had a couple of drinks with lunch, and they were ok."}
{"text":"If you're looking for burgers that are exceptional Dillinger is your place! It's got a great atmosphere a full bar and so many things I love on the menu, I always can't wait to go back! They also do live music on the weekends so make sure you check that out also!"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers, awesome service. We came back after our visit to the Hoover Dam. Burgers were not overly greasy and were delish. Husband had the peanut butter burger and it was awesome! I had their version of the patty melt (can't remember the name of it...uh, Bonnie melt??) and was pleased. Cole slaw wasn't really that great, but excellent selection of beer. Everything was reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"Place was great!! Staff was friendly got greeted right away by the bartender. Food was very Yummy!!"}
{"text":"I am a very tough person to please when it comes to a good burger. This place did NOT disappoint!!  I had \"the 45 Special\" which has cheddar, jack and Swiss cheese and is considered the \"cheesiest burger in Boulder City\". LOVED IT!!  The fries were tasty, a little bit on the oily side. For dessert we had the bread pudding and that was DELISH!!!  Very cozy atmosphere, a bit dark, very friendly service, came by several times to see how we were doing and ask if we needed refills, which is a HuGe plus in my book! Definitely a place I wanna come back to on my next trip out to Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome ! Great food ! Always look forward to eating there"}
{"text":"An afternoon of antique store shopping, a friendly stroll down main street in good ol' Boulder City our appetites were peaked.  What better place to try than a joint named Dillinger's (ya know, the infamous bank robber?).   Say what? Bloody Mary bar? Yep that's right folks, create your own bloody marys..mm...Ok, on to the food.  Burgers, burgers, sandwiches, wraps, delicious soup..Flavor-packed deliciousness!  I wish I would have known about this place sooner, Boulder City is my go-to getaway spot when I've had it with the Vegas hustle and bustle.  I have had my routine eatery in Boulder City for some time which is great for out door dining during peak weather situations, however the food at Dillinger's blows it's \"competition\" away.  Looking for a place to unwind for the day? Stroll the quaint streets of Boulder City and indulge in delicious eats and thirst quenching drinks at Dillinger's."}
{"text":"I went here after a day out on the river and I was pleasantly surprised. First off, this is a cute, quirky, clean, lively, little town with cool statues on every corner ( shout out to the toilet paper man statue)  I ordered the bugsy burger which had cheddar cheese and bacon and I thought the meat was on point. Bacon is always good. Cheese was on point. Not crazy about the white bread bun, it was a dud for me ( I would try the wheat and ask for it to be toasted next time )  the French fries were crispy and seasoned heavy, they were good. I had a craft ipa and that was good too. They had some crazy burgers with weird names and odd Condiments like penut butter.  I also had the fire roasted artichoke and that was really good too. The aoili sauce that came with it was really good. I went heavy on the dipping. I had their cheese cake and you gotta try it.  It was refreshing with lime zest and the creamy cheese to cut it was nice. For 8 bucks when I saw the size I wasn't impressed as it was a standard slice, but after a couple bites I knew it was worth every penny. Overall you can really taste the love. The menu takes risks but from my experience they delivered 100%.  Friendly, young, smiley staff too! Good service. I sat outside because summer nights with a little breeze is awesome but the inside looked dark and intimate."}
{"text":"Great place! We ate here after touring the Hoover Dam. Great food and customer service. They offer a military discount, which is always a winner for my hubby and I. The best garlic fries and burgers!!!"}
{"text":"This place is overall good. Good service is a hit or miss. Food is usually good. Cool, laid back atmosphere. Sometimes they have live entertainment which is cool. Good beer selection. I've been here a few times and like the place. Sometimes I forget it's there in BC because it's not on the main drag."}
{"text":"I stopped by on another trip to Boulder City. The menu is funny and the decor was very appropriate. The doors have gun handles and there are old photos of old gangsters.  The service was ok. Not attentive or friendly, but efficient. The food choices picked by my family were not all available and this was told to us on 2 different occasions (no milk to drink and the hot dog on the menu is not going to be carried anymore). The tuna melt was good. The sourdough bread was toasty and the tuna was fresh. The Dillinger hamburger was average. The hamburger meat was dry. The Asian slaw was great and the brisket was delcious. The fries are battered which I'm not a fan of."}
{"text":"Burgers as good, and often better, than the ones you'll find in Las Vegas. The menu is tilted towards the burger set, but has delicious wraps, nice size salads, sweet potato fries.  Built into an old bank the dates back to the building of Hoover Dam, the place has limited seating but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Our motel's front desk suggested this place. I should not have listened and will let them know. We had terrible service, apparently due to our being from out of town. We waited forever to order our food while our waitress gave extra attention to others including one particular table, apparently locals. I noticed similar treatment of others who appeared to be tourists. When we asked for service, we got attitude and little help.  When the appetizer finally arrived, it was just dropped on the table. I'm sorry that I left any tip at all. No accommodation of any kind was made or offered. The food is pretty good but certainly not worth the bad service and crazy wait for the food to arrive.  The host was nice and helpful, however that couldn't save a dismal experience. Skip this place and try one of the other more interesting spots in this quaint part of town with what I am sure is much better service to all guests.  Several days after posting this review, \"Grant T. of the Dillinger,\" who I assume is the owner, posted a comment.  Interestingly, he did everything but apologize for the poor attitude of and terrible service provided by our waitress and the fact that she spent the majority of the time we were there serving one particular table for which she clearly had an affinity while at the same time virtually ignoring our table.  After waiting and waiting, we were able to order only after I asked the host to get her attention, so that we could order.  Instead of casting unwarranted aspersions at guests who receive unsatisfactory customer service, I suggest that he apologize for the poor experience and commit to improving service at his establishment.  By the way, the food was good, not great, and the ambience is much closer to lackluster than outstanding.  The only productive aspect of Grant T.'s comment was to remind me that I should do a better job of remembering to post positive reviews of restaurants where I have a good experience.  Interestingly, the very next morning, my daughters and I had breakfast at the Southwest Diner in Boulder City.  The food and the service were nothing short of amazing and worthy of a 5-star rating, which I will now post.  Be sure to check that place out the next time you're in Boulder City."}
{"text":"Ate here last night and it was VERY VERY good! You all should try it."}
{"text":"Friendly and Attentive Service.  Best Food in Historic Boulder City!  It is small, and gets pretty busy, so you may have to wait for a table or a seat at the bar during some evenings.  I waited about 10 minutes during this visit, and it was well worth it.  Had the Capone which is a bacon cheeseburger with fried egg.  My Dad had the Brisket Sandwich.  They were both excellent.  Cannot wait to come again and try the Dillinger Burger."}
{"text":"\"All my life I wanted to be a bank robber. Carry a gun and wear a mask. Now that it's happened I guess I'm just about the best bank robber they ever had. And I sure am happy.\" ~J Dill  The Dillinger has become a great addition to Boulder City. Ownership was well aware of the niche this establishment could fill. With stellar social media marketing, big juicy burgers, generous beer specials, and a lively atmosphere, they have struck gold in the Silver State.  The last time I dined here I was in town visiting my parents over the Thanksgiving weekend. It was my lucky night...$1 PBR drafts! I wanted to go H.A.M. on PBR just like back in A019 Hamilton Hall junior year, but I had to be a good influence for my sister. I reluctantly stopped after five.  The burgers here are fantastic for their price point. The Dillinger is the signature burger topped with beef brisket--fantastic! It can definitely feed two, but it is so good it is hard to share! The Yakuza burger is topped with their Asian slaw--definitely another one that is hard to put down. I would love some more spice in the slaw, however. Sriracha! Not kamikaze levels, but maybe just a light karate chop.    Well done, I'll see you soon."}
{"text":"We came on a Saturday night that they were having a block party! I had an apricot beer that was very good!"}
{"text":"This has become our family's very favorite place to chow down in Boulder City. Consistent and super friendly service and really delicious food. The burgers never disappoint and they have a very decent beer list. I love this place! Get the onion rings."}
{"text":"Had never actually been into downtown Boulder City, so I went down on a recent Saturday into the downtown area to see what it was all about. After stopping into several of the local businesses we kept getting great reviews from the locals about The Dillinger.  This place is the type of small restaurant and bar that I absolutely love. The server and bar staff were really welcoming when we came in for lunch.   They have a fairly small menu focused mainly on the burgers. And I have to say they are exceptional. I wouldn't say its close to the best burger I've ever had but it's definitely up there. My wife had The Dillinger which is the namesake burger.  It's topped with applewood smoked bacon, slow cooked beef brisket, and cheddar cheese. It all meshes so well it should be illegal. Dillinger would be proud....It was AMAZING! I really wasn't expecting how good it would be. And for the food challenge lover they have the Widow maker which is a Double Dillinger, which someone ate while we were there (albeit with a knife and fork???) I went with the Baby Face Nelson which is basically a Caprese salad with fig spread on top of a burger. It was really good, but just doesn't compare to The Dillinger.  The also have an AMAZING beer selection, with a ton of smaller craft breweries on draft and bottle. For me it was a great day because it was the first time I had ever had the Dogfish head 75 minute IPA on a suggestion from our server. They have a total of 9 different Dogfish options on draft and bottle and several others from Rogue, Big Dog's, etc. But they also get down and dirty with the PBR for those who are looking for a cheaper selection. And on Wednesday they are only $1.  The beer was $15 which is the going rate everywhere in town (25oz bottle) The Dillinger was $11 and The Baby Face was $12.50. This was exceptionally reasonable for a quality hand crafted burger. Along with it we got both types of fries of which, of the 2, the sweet potato fries were the easy winner.  After walking around all of Boulder City that day, I found nothing else that even compares to this place without heading into Vegas.  If you find yourself in Boulder City you have to check this place out."}
{"text":"Originally from Boulder City and when I come back to visit I like to come here for dinner! All the food is really good. No complaints!"}
{"text":"This was a great find on our trip to the Hoovee Dam. Our food was delicious & the staff was great. Our server brought me a small taste of their Mac&Cheese because she knew we were from way out of town and not likely to make it back. But if we ever do we definitely stop back in!"}
{"text":"I ordered the chopped salad which was really good, but maybe a little \"lettuce heavy\" and could have used more of the other ingredients.  My husband ordered the Stickey burger, the one with peanut butter on it.  He liked it and the service was also excellent.  Small, quaint and cozy.  Very nice for a date night getaway!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go if you are going to the Hoover Dam.  The food is good and so is the service."}
{"text":"Awesome stop after the Hoover Dam. Wine for $16 a bottle! It's even a wine I drink! Atmosphere is nice. Inside and outside seating. Located in a quaint shopping village. Nice and relaxing!Get the frickin pickle! Great waitress!"}
{"text":"Boulder City NV. Great burger & a cold beer after a Hoover Dam tour."}
{"text":"This is a generous three star review. Just left after waiting nearly an hour for our food. Granted it is a Friday night, and we got there around 6 o'clock. But there were only four of us and our order was nothing special. Chicken strips, a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and two burgers. We really wanted to like this place, and the food was good, but it was not worth a 45 minute wait. When we mentioned the long wait to the waitress, her comment was only about how she was new there and she wasn't sure if that long of a wait was typical. That has nothing to do with customer service! At least she apologized for the long wait. We won't be back."}
{"text":"We LOVED the burgers super good! The fries were thin and just okay. The prices were also a little high with a tip it was 21$ for 2 burgers and fries."}
{"text":"Really good food. Friendly people, great music! Prices are good. The cosmopolitan the girl made me was amazing! Good place to go!"}
{"text":"Interesting food. Went with The Dillinger burger. Love the music. Could use a larger on tap craft beer selection."}
{"text":"Fried macaroni and cheese balls !!! Did I get your attention?? They were amazing little nuggets of gooey goodness all wrapped up into a perfect bite.  Awesome burgers- creative names and good toppings.  The Dillinger was probably my favorite. A perfect hamburger patty topped with brisket. Throw in some onion rings and a pitcher of blue moon and I'll probably never leave."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere here are great.  The metal tables with bullets inlayed are pretty sweet.  The onion rings were great and my burger was good too.  I was told to have the Dillinger by a friend but decided to have another burger instead, and it was good.  I will definitely be back to try the Dillinger burger.  The staff was friendly and attentive and took care of us and our kids."}
{"text":"Everyone told this place was fantastic. Maybe my expectations were too high. I tried the seafood bisque and have had better out of a can. The Dillinger was actually a good buger, but seemed as though they put chili on top. I wasn't impressed. They do have some tasty draft beer though!"}
{"text":"Small place was busy for father's day. The paid attention to their customers and took care of us. Great staff giving great service!"}
{"text":"Had some business in BC so decided to try something new and went here.  The menu is pretty extensive and they try to accommodate even if you order off the menu.  I had the burger and it was delicious, no grease and LOVED the buns, not the wimpy buns you get elsewhere.  My guy had the melt as he has been craving one and he said its one of the best. The frys were delicious!!  We have already decided what we want next time"}
{"text":"I stopped there on my way to Utah, and I was pleasantly surprised by the good food and the good service of that cozy bar. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Not a NewYork Reben!  Corn beef tough.  Sandwich greasy. Asian slaw given as side was soggy.  Would not recommend food here.  My friend had a salad which was very good."}
{"text":"Was at Dillinger's for the block party! Had terrible service first $70 spent then changed servers! The next server after  half an hour came by and we ordered food, food was good! After ordering more drinks  we ask for the bill! Payed the bill hadn't finished our drinks but was ask to  leave because we paid our bill! Never again!! Treated crappy by servers aftet spending over over $ 140!! I could have went to Jack's and spent $30 and would have been treated better!"}
{"text":"After kayaking at the lake, we all developed an appetite and I went on handy dandy Yelp and found this place. It had good ratings so we took a leap of faith.   First off, boulder city is such a cute little town. Looking for this place I saw a lot of places I would want to come back and try!  Place was busy but not too busy where we couldn't be seated right away. They had an outdoor seating as well. Menu isn't too cluttered, you can automatically see everything they offer which I liked. I decided on a firehouse chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries and everyone else got the infamous Dillinger Burger.   My sandwich was pretty good. It had a good kick to it. It had jalapeño bacon! Yum! The sweet potato fries were the bomb! It was definitely made for more of a sweeter taste rather than savory. It had a sugar cinnamon taste which is different than other fries I've had.   The Dillinger burger was pretty good as well. There was just too much going on with that burger tho. A lot of meat in it, which is not technically a bad thing. It just didn't sit well with me. But the actual burger was good.   The check took a while to come out  but it was getting kind of busy. And my water wasn't refilled the entire meal. Other than that our server was great. I left full but I don't know if I left satisfied."}
{"text":"We were famished after visiting the Hoover Dam so my husband and I made our way to Boulder City to check out this place. Parking was easy enough and the patio was packed with families and had a TV and water misters. We opted to sit inside. The bar crowd can be a bit rowdy at times (I would say I saw the chest and stomachs of 2 patrons while sitting down lol), so I get why so many families were outside. We sat at a table and were greeted quickly by the staff and given menus. We're boring so we opted for water (needed the hydration after the Hoover Dam visit) and I got a ginger ale. My friend highly recommended the Dillinger, which my husband ordered with a side of onion rings. He devoured the burger and said he had never eaten anything like it. The onion rings were also very crispy and not oily. I opted for the philly-style nachos. Everything was good, but the cheese and meat were very cold, like it had been sitting out for awhile. Otherwise, our visit here was very pleasant and the staff was very friendly. The women's bathroom was very clean and they had a sample of a sea salt scrub there which I used twice since I sweated like a pig from being outside."}
{"text":"We went here on a Tuesday night after being told they MIGHT be open.  It was 8:20 pm. Earlier we called the Boulder Dam Brewing Co. and they told us they were open until 9. They didn't tell us only for beer. They close the kitchen at 8 and also apparently role up the sidewalks then  in Boulder City. So we went to Dillinger who was serving til 10 and the full bar closes when it slows down.   I had the burger with the grilled sourdough. The burgers are 1/2 lb burgers so you get a lot. My wife had the one with the egg on it. (I can't remember the actual names they were called) Both burgers were very  moist and flavorful. The onion rings were good and crispy.   The staff was friendly and attentive.   Even if this wasn't the only place in town open I would recommend it for some very good burgers and a casual welcoming atmosphere."}
{"text":"Never been to this place before and my first impression was really positive. The place is quite small, but the also have outdoor seating. Ordered Chinese Salad with Chicken and The Dillinger burger for the party of two. Believe it or not - the portions are so big, you can easily feed four ppl. Service is great. We waited about 10 min for our order, which is really fast!!! So 5 out of 5!"}
{"text":"Where to begin. Good and not so good experience.  Had high hopes, but was disappointed and only left with heartburn and a \"bad taste\" in my mouth.   This place has great potential and needs a few tweaks to improve food and service.   It was explained to my boyfriend and I, that if a larger group came in we'd have to move from the table to a smaller table. Since none were available at that time. Except for a corner at the bar.  The gentleman that sat us we later learned is the owner/manager.  Our waitress was an older lady in her mid to late 50's I think.  She explained to us that she was \"very busy\". Okay!  It's a small venue and had 3 servers and it wasn't that busy to me, but okay.   We ordered the artichoke appetizer, which took 15 minutes to come. While we waited our waitress could have taken our food order, but didn't come back to our table until the artichoke came. Maybe it's the sleepy town mentality, but us big city folk like prompt and efficient service. I also don't care how busy you are, I'm willing to tip more for top service and a server can make good money if they enjoy their job.  Finally!!!  Were going to order 25 minutes after sitting there. I had a question about the jalapeño bacon, I've never had it. \"It's amazing!!!\"  Okay, I'll get that and the aioli on the side. She declined my request by saying \"just go all out and do it\". Okay, I'm pretty easy, but she doesn't know I'm not the biggest fan of aioli and only like a little, but I agreed. She stated it was her favorite thing on the menu. My boyfriend had questions about his food as well, and she stated \"everything here is amazing! There's not anything that isn't good\" and walked away.  Our questions were only curiosity, not knocking the food.  We finally get our food about 30 minutes later. My bread was soggy and the pre-frozen spongy chicken breast kept sliding off the bun. And there was way too much aioli for my liking. The fries were like Burger King but much saltier. I couldn't finish them.   Moving on, the service was lacking and it seemed that the two people had chips on their shoulder. Nothing wrong with loving your business and what you do, but not everyone has to agree or is going to.  I would have agreed if the food was made with fresh crispy chicken and fresh not-so-salty fries. I would have paid $15 instead of the $9.50.   However, on a positive note .... It is good food if you were drunk on beer or stoned and had the munchies.   I think you guys should keep the menu, it's kind of cool the options, just make them better.  I like fresh ingredients and anything processed or frozen isn't up to par at any food establishment.   And remember, kindness goes a lot farther than the salty demeanor we experienced.  I love salt, but I may have to get on cholesterol Meds after my visit."}
{"text":"Good beer selection. Creative burgers. Decent vegetarian options. Try the fricken pickle!"}
{"text":"The Dillinger - best damn burger ever! Bacon cheddar brisket burger - they don't freeze their patties and it makes a difference! Also tried the brisket sandwich - I can't remember the last time I had melt in your mouth brisket. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch today with two others and the food and staff were great. We all ordered 3 different burgers, the Dillenger, the Executioner and a pastrami burger I can't remember the name of. Of course I had to eat some of everyone else's and they were excellent, both the fries & onion rings are great!"}
{"text":"I have been here MANY times. Not a burger person but this place has changed me. My favorite burger is the Baron; it has pastrami, blue cheese, and a special slaw... can't beat it. French fries are thin, seasoned, and crunchy, SUPERB. The bread pudding is also good, but i am usually filled to the top by the burger. I've never had bad service, the people that work there are friendly and consistent. If you are in Boulder, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Cool little spot. Dropped in for lunch and it was great. Great burgers priced right. Staff was attentive and friendly. Awesome tee shirts for sale too. Loved the Gangster theme throughout ."}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant/bar in Boulder City. Great hamburgers and good beer selection. Love the small business atmosphere and great food."}
{"text":"On vacation the Dillinger sounded good we stoped by and was delicious. I had the freakin pickles and the 45 special both were great. Costumer service wasn't the best felt, me and my friends felt as if we weren't welcomed."}
{"text":"love this place. the food is amazing. portions are huge and the meat is awesome. the servers are so friendly. we take our out of town visitors there every time and we're never disappointed."}
{"text":"My husband surprised me with a date night for the first time since we have had our second child over 3 months ago (who also had colic). We live about 40 minutes away from Pahrump and drove all the way to boulder city to try this place out and it did not disappoint!! We had 3 jack and cokes and the both of us had the Dillinger burger. By far the best burger we have ever had! It was perfect, and so relaxing for us to be out and to be able to enjoy each others company! Thank you so much for making tonight so special for me and my husband!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here after walking around the railroad tunnels near Lake Mead. It's also a great place to stop in after thrift shopping or walking around in Boulder City. We had our dogs with us and they do allow dogs to sit at the outside tables. They have a great selection of beer - I had the lemon ginger sour. Very refreshing on a sunny fall day. My friend ordered the hostage turkey burger and I can't tell if she ordered it without the bun or if it just doesn't come with a bun.. the menu doesn't seem to indicate no bun. Anyways it looked healthy with plenty of sweet potato fries. I had the chicken Caesar wrap. I think you can always tell what a Caesar wrap is going to taste like and this was no different. The one surprise was the croutons in the wrap. I liked it but of course they ended up being soggy bread near the end of it. The fries were probably my favorite part. Thin, crispy, and dusted with parsley and salt. Delicious (my dog likes them too). The staff were all very friendly, bringing our dogs water and giving them lots of love. I love anywhere that'll allow me to bring my dog and there's not a lot of places like this in Vegas. The food wasn't mind blowing or anything but the atmosphere was great and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great burgers and sides, huge portions! Definitely a good burger place. I have heard they have live music as well. We went for lunch on the weekend and there wasn't music at that time."}
{"text":"They have outside and inside dining. Once you enter the doors you find that the space is smaller then expected but not to the point of crushing. The staff was friendly, although the server had no name tag nor welcomed my girlfriend and I with her name.   I had the signature burger \" The Dillinger\" which had a really large patty topped with Applewood bacon, cheese, and BBQ brisket.  The brisket was overpowering with the saturation level of BBQ sauce on it. The onion rings I had with it were cooked to perfection and tasted excellent. My girlfriend had the \"Bonnie melt\". It was excellent and I was wishing to have that one.  Overall I would say I would definitely return to give them a second try."}
{"text":"I had the Dillinger burger. Enough food for two. A bit much actually. Sweet potato fries are great. Smoking outside ruins that experience."}
{"text":"AWESOME experience today!!!!! One of the few places open today in BC being New Years Day, we saw a line of people. Only had to wait 15 min though. Score! We had Stephanie as our server. Score!!! She is our fave. Beer snobs, this girl knows her beer!  Score! And, she's an AWSOME server as well. Score!!    I took a chance today and deviated from the signature Dillinger burger, and went with the Sticky Burger. It was a stretch. I mean, peanut butter, in a burger? Hell yeah! I recommend!!! I like my bacon crispy, and the burger came out with cooked but limp bacon. Next time I'll ask for crispy bacon. I didn't put any fixings or condiments in mine. I loved it. I had the CraftHaus IPA to go with it. Really good pairing for my taste buds.   My wife had the Dillinger and as always, BOMBER!! She had the Moscato and was very happy with it. I forget what vineyard it was.   Try the Sticky Burger. If you don't love it, you'll at least like it. And if you never order it again, you'll at least be able to say you had a burger with peanut butter on it!!!"}
{"text":"Great food the Dillinger and the sweet potato fries was it!! Stopped by on the way back from the hover dam while in town for SEMA. Definitely one of our favorite meals since we've gotten out here including places we've ate on the strip. Great place friendly people!"}
{"text":"Excellent \"off strip\" place when you want to get away from Vegas or you're doing a day trip to the Hoover Dam. The staff is pleasant and the service is exceptional!"}
{"text":"Best burger joint in 50 miles! I had the burger with bacon and peanut butter with a fried egg on it. Amazing!! I cant explain it but it just works perfectly. The onion rings are nice and crisp with the perfect amount of seasoning in the batter. The fried cheese is a great appetizer to start with before you dig into you burger! Next time I want to try some of the draft specials they have here. Gotta give this place a shot if your heading into boulder city."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. I sat at the bar. I noticed a pitcher of Lemonade. I asked if it was Lemonade, the bartender said yes and I ordered a glass. It had almost no lemon flavor. I asked the bartender to try it. She said it tasted normal but that it was Minute Maid and that it just wasn't very good. She offered to replace it and I had a soda. I ordered the chili and their signature burger, the Dillinger, which comes toped with cheddar, bacon and brisket. The chili could have been made by Gerber. It was very fine ground beef with the slightest hint of chili powder flavor. I ordered it with onion and cheddar and there was about a teaspoon of each. It was very fine grained and flavorless. It is chili for some one with an ulcer and no teeth. Not good at all. The burger was equally disappointing. The patty was cooked to order with no noticeable seasoning. The brisket is shredded in a sweet sticky sauce. The bun did not hold up at all. A third of the way through eating it, the lower bun was wet and dime thin. Fries were nondescript."}
{"text":"We were in Las Vegas for a work trip and had some free time our last day. After visiting the Hoover Dam, we hopped on Yelp for a good place to eat. The Dillinger not only had great reviews but it was close! It's located in Historic Boulder City; very cute little town. The Dillinger is a small place that feels divy but is very clean. The staff was very friendly and welcoming.   The sandwich selection was impressive. It made it very hard to choose between all of the delicious sounding sandwiches. We started with a fire roasted artichoke; which a table of 4 shared. It was just that, an artichoke cut in half and fire roasted. It came with a dipping sauce which tasted a little like thousand island dressing. It was very simple but very good if you like artichokes.   I ordered a jalapeño bacon chicken sandwich which was OMG good. Other selections at the table were tuna melt, Ruben, and Caesar salad. Everyone was very happy with their choices.   I do have to mention the fries. I ordered sweet  potato and the other ordered regular. The regular fries were really good but the sweet potato fries were just fantastic. Probably the best I've ever had!!   If you find yourself near Boulder City, NV, you won't be disappointed with The Dillinger."}
{"text":"This place is solid for a quick, no-frills bite before/after checking out the Hoover Dam. They're known for their burgers so I got a plain one with blue cheese. They have a lot of different options/toppings but sometimes a burger with nothing on it is so satisfying. This is a good burger. Generous in size and delicious in flavor. For an extra $1 you can upgrade to sweet potato fries which were decent."}
{"text":"As much as we go here I should have already done a review! Well, it's the place to go in town for dinner. We even get takeaway from here.  The black bean burger with avo and red onion and sweet potato fries is my staple.  My husband eats all the burgers and says each one is his favorite.  Cocktails are good. Sit outside and watch the world drive by."}
{"text":"\"Well, just stop for a little second and think about it. Will you do that for me?...No, you're not thinkin. You're too busy bein a smart aleck to be thinkin. Now I want you to *think* and stop bein' a smart aleck. Can ya try that for me?\" -The Cowboy, Mulholland Drive  When you make the brief trek out to a place like this - and make no mistake, it's absolutely worth the drive - you might could do a little research. If you do, you will order a burger and onion rings. And this is one tasty burger.  You don't get the chicken at the steakhouse, guys. Stop for a little second and think about it.  Order a burger.  This...is the grill."}
{"text":"If you are driving back or to Las Vegas from Phoenix, you should make the stop.  Phenomenal burger and Sweet Potatoe Fries.  Just a good burger for 10 bucks."}
{"text":"Cool little bar vibe with gangster decor, double barrel shotguns were the front door pulls/hardware.   Mix of locals and tourists. Every table and bar stool was filled on a cold Sat night.   The Dillinger burger was tasty and consisted of a beef patty, cheese, bacon, and BBQ brisket with BBQ sauce. Very good!  Full bar with about 5 beers in tap. Tracy, the very attractive, blonde bartender made a mean martini. I enjoyed watching her hand shaking the drinks ;)  I would definitely return and especially if Tracy was working."}
{"text":"Thank you Jesse and Alia for the reco on this place!!  The location is cool and there are six small tables outside and about 8 tables inside with about 8 more seats at the bar. We had a seat at a table inside and were given menus and placed our drink orders and ordered the gouda mac and cheese bites as an appetizer.   I ordered the CraftHaus IPA which I was told was a local beer as well as the BBQ Brisket sandwich while my wife ordered the steak salad.   Our orders arrived in a timely manner and looked yummy. My wife thought the salad was just okay, nothing special. It seemed very light on the salad toppings and didn't have a lot of flavor. The brisket sandwich was pretty tasty.  The Mac and cheese bites were delicious.   Overall it was a good experience and a cool place to check out."}
{"text":"Really cold beer served in a frosted glass. Num. Spinach salad was fresh and the sandwich was good too. Two drinks and two main dishes and out the door for under 40 with tax and tip. Recommend."}
{"text":"Took a trip to BC from Vegas and loved this little spot. The air is cool; sitting outside was a must. Not a problem finding a table, so we're in business.  Ordered the Reuben & The 45 burger, to share & try both (our server said you can't go wrong either way). The little guy ordered kid's chicken fingers & fries. The onion rings, fries & sweet potato fries - one was better than the next - and they were all delish! Our burger was cooked perfectly medium, score! Chicken fingers were especially flavorlicious, just a tad dry- no complaints, however. The Reuben was also good.   The standouts for me, though, which I would order again were the 45 Burger & any of the fried sides.   Also, tried a hefeweizen suggested by our server - she was so helpful, had great timing and just the right level of sincere hospitality...for that, you sold me a 5 star review."}
{"text":"As a resident I wanted to give The Dillinger another try and assure that I wasn't to sceptical the first time.  It could have been an anomaly.  So we went yesterday and the burger wss pretty good but low and behold the lettuce was bad again.  I dont know who works in the kitchen or if management even cares but this is some shotty food delivery.  So if your ordering anything with produce from this place, be very cautious."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a quick trip to the dam.  It wasn't too busy and we were seated right away.  The bartender was also our server, she suggested menu items and got us our drinks right away.  I had heard that the burgers were awesome so I ordered one.  The other people in my party ordered the steak sandwhich and the chicken caesar wrap.  Everyone was happy with their food.  The service was excellent and the prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Surely, the highlight of Boulder City. Live band, great food, dirt cheap drinks...perfect. Place closes at midnight...this is as close as its going to get to \"Vegas\" in Boulder. Cool place."}
{"text":"Great spot for a burger and beer in historic Boulder City. Friendly staff, comfortable setting and good food. Burgers are great, you'll have a ball."}
{"text":"Always wanted to check out the Dillinger and finally made my way to Boulder City. It was during Art in the Park so it was busy. we waited about 20 mins for a table that we had to share with another couple. It was a bar atmosphere that it wasn't to bad.  I ordered a cheeseburger with bacon. They are decent size so I split it with my wife along with the seasoned fries. The burger was decent, nothing to rave about but the bacon was horrible. Undercooked and all fatty, not a pleasant taste at all.  I will come back to give this place another shot when in the area but not worth going out of the way for."}
{"text":"A great idea to revise the menu and keep a lot of the favorites.  If you like spicy try the firehouse chic sand"}
{"text":"I have waited to write this post because it is a downgrade from my last one. I have been to this restaurant often as I live in BC, however there is a definite degradation of service and skill. The food is coming out of the kitchen much slower and often not cooked to the proper temperature. Sending it back to the kitchen would only make the wait longer so I have simply not enjoyed my meal the last 3 or 4 times we visited. The wait staff is not near as attentive.   If this were my first visit I would not return. Oh, and the french fries are frozen supermarket grade."}
{"text":"Excellent spot. We were at the Hoover Dam and decided to skip the food at the park. This place is only 5 miles from the Hoover Dam.   It is worth the short ride.  Great food and service! Spend your money at this location....you won't regret it."}
{"text":"The waitresses were very friendly and welcoming. The service was great. The food was good but is on the greasy side. Not a place for people that are looking for health conscious food."}
{"text":"Great food, good beer on tap, good service, nice atmosphere.  The sweet potato fries were great!  Seafood bisque was good, but the Reuben was great!"}
{"text":"Five stars for exceeding expectations!  Out here you could probably cut corners and survive because there just aren't that many options but Dillinger takes no such shortcuts.  The food, drink and service were quality.  I had their namesake burger and it was one of the best burgers I've had.  Looking around the table of 9 there was not an extra bite or spare onion ring to be had.  Only the 16 year old boy water polo player declared 'I still have room for dessert' as the rest of us were more than satisfied.   If you spent the day on the lake and are looking for a hearty - if not completely healthy - meal then do yourself a favor and head over to The Dillinger.  It's a tad small on the inside so if you think of it ahead of time call and make a reservation - they appreciate it."}
{"text":"Went here after going to Hoover Dam. Super friendly staff, amazing burger (I had the Bonnie melt), and the best homemade cheesecake I've ever had."}
{"text":"It was ok. Kinda overpriced for the food. Wasn't real happy with the service either. I will pass."}
{"text":"My last meal would be a burger and I might request it to be from this place. I live clear on the other side of town but I will make it a point to go here every time I'm in or around the area. The burgers are so delicious and so filling that you're almost guaranteed to walk out with a waddle, but it's worth it. This is a MUST if you even kinda sorta like a burger and fries."}
{"text":"the decor is cool.....the menu is a typical bar menu.  The wait staff is not friendly at all.  I don't know if we just got there on a bad night or what.  The food was good.  We will go back again to see if anything changes.  To make it in BC who better have the whole package to make it."}
{"text":"These were probably the best burgers I've ever had. I came here with my parents because it had been in my bookmarks forever and we were heading to Boulder City anyway and blah blah blah and it was dollar PBR night. I don't think I've had a drink that cost a dollar since I moved to Nevada. Yeah, that's right, I drink Peebers, don't you judge me.  Anyway, onto the food. My dad ordered the Dillinger (delicious brisket on top of the burger with BBQ sauce), my mom got the babyface (brie cheese and fig jam on top of the burger) and I opted for the veggie standard of the portabella mushroom sandwich, topped with red peppers and added avocado. Hell to the yes, each one was more incredible than the last.   I also opted for sweet potato fries, which I enjoyed, but they had a brown sugar/maple thing on them, which made them very sweet. This is the kind of place I ache for in Vegas, but just doesn't exist.   I can't wait for my return visit!"}
{"text":"We were so thrilled by our service and meal. We didn't have to wait long for patio seating with our two dogs. The Manager (Grant) brought out bacon treat and water for our dogs and explained in detail the draft beer choices. We loved the small town atmosphere of sitting outside and it wasn't too loud even with 2 big parties. Thursday perfect dinner out. Glad we stopped by on our way thru town. Wish we were local and could come back weekly. :-) :-)"}
{"text":"This place was great. Came here after the Boulder City Beer Fest and grabbed some grub.   To begin with, PBR on draft for $2. Deal? I think yes!   Food: the food was great. I got the chicken strips with fries and a side of their homemade ranch. Diner style and really good after a day of drinking and being out in the sun. The girlfriend got the fig burger. Doesn't sound good off the start, but let me tell you...if you like the sweet/salty combination, DEFINITELY give this burger a try!   The staff here is super friendly, and the place itself is dog-friendly as they have patio/sidewalk seating.   Would I come back here? Absolutely.  Would I recommend this place to others? You betchya."}
{"text":"Great food and awesome atmosphere.  Burgers are amazing.  Not too small, not too big. Live music on the weekends. Gonna be the new spot. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Beware of drunk middle age women that complain that everyone knows their business. Here is a hint that might prevent that. Put down the beer and shut your mouth. You are not at the kegger after the high school football game."}
{"text":"WOW! My family and I were on vacation in Vegas and after a long day of visiting the Hoover Dam, Lake Mead, and off-roading through the desert; we decided to stop in Boulder City for dinner.  We were all so glad we stumbled upon this restaurant.  The neighborhood had charm and was very welcoming.  Our burgers/sandwiches were perfect, priced reasonably, and our server was very engaged.  We also all liked that on the menu under the 'pasta' section, it tells you to go across the street to another restaurant because they have really good pasta.  The restaurant had great character and great food to match it.  All six of us agreed that The Dillinger was a new favorite.  Definitely would recommend it to anyone traveling to Las Vegas that needs a night off the strip!"}
{"text":"An amazing burger joint. Had the Brie and Jam burger, never even seen that type of burger before. was really good. Beer was amazing. chill spot."}
{"text":"food was ok and the beer was actually nice. But jesus christ the service...we walked up and asked the older waitress if we could sit on the patio, she seemed annoyed that we even asked and said in a negative tone,\"you'll have to wait until i can clean all these tables,\" then rolled her eyes. Cool, so we waited, myself, my wife and my 5 month year old daughter. We sit and then are greeted by a nice young waitress, we ask for menus and she goes to get them, upon her return with them we tell her  that we'll need a few moments, but i do order a beer and 2 waters. About 1 minute later the older waitress comes back and asked if we we're ready to order, we said no that we just got the menus. She rolled her eyes and scoffed and then said, \"well just hurry.\" \"Just hurry,\" are you kidding me. I'm a server, I've been one for 4 years now and i would never speak that way to a customer. Fire her really quick, cause she will send others packing. Maybe she was mad cause she had to take a table on the patio or cause i had a baby, but either way it was uncalled for. The other young lady came back to take the order, she was sweet and then she took off and then another waitress came over and was nice as well. Just tread lightly while there cause you may get that old mean waitress. Will not be going back anytime soon thanks to that waitress."}
{"text":"Good music, good company, the burger's were fabulous. Ordered the Yakuzza with the Asian slaw on the burger. Yummy fries on the side. With an amber ale. Mmmmm great!!"}
{"text":"Stopped and had lunch after visiting the dam. Fantastic corned beef and piled high. My wife had their bacon cheddar burger and could only eat 1/2 of it. I would definitely stop back again. The beet was cold and the prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Omg, this place!! I went here like 1.5 years ago in February 2016 on our way back to Tucson from a Las Vegas trip and a Hoover dam stop. We came here for lunch with our dog. We waited a few minutes while a few parties in front of us were seated. We were then seated on the patio area, ordered drinks, then later ordered food... then 45 minutes goes by, other tables who were seated and served after us finish their meals and leave before we even get our food. Our server was never seen again, but finally we flagged someone down and asked them if they could check on our food. They said it would be right out. Another 15-20 elapsed and we finally got our food. Obviously something went wrong on their end and our order was forgotten, and obviously we were annoyed by that. If we hadn't already invested so much time there and if had been any other viable restaurant options nearby we would have left on principle alone. So, I (very directly, but not rudely) addressed the issue with the new guy who had brought us food (some middle aged white dude, seemed like just wait staff, not an owner or anything). I suggested that they comp our meal for the egregious time inconvenience that stepping foot in their establishment had cost us. The guy literally looked at me and said \"are you serious?\" An hour+ wait for food, and clearly losing our ticket? I think that's a comp-worthy offense. They ended up comping us our 2 beers (which equates to about $10) and I remember middle aged dude condescendingly asking if I wanted another beer, like the reason I was asking for compensation was because I was drunk(?) from my 1 free beer, not because they totally dropped the ball.  We actually paid the bill too, cuz we're decent people, but I regret not just walking out. I considered calling and speaking to a manager for reimbursement once I got back home but never followed up.   Oh yeah, and the food was garbage."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is relaxed with a good vibe. The food has been on point every time we've come out to BC. We've been coming out here for a few years now, just for the variety of their amazing burgers! The wait staff is consistently friendly & efficient. A few times we've been out they've had a live band on the patio/sidewalk, great live music always a great addition!  Tonight in particular we had the opportunity to go out without our children & enjoy an adult's night out. The place was packed, with a fun vibe.  Unfortunately, there was one group of couples that were truly inflicting their presence upon everyone else, specifically one woman in the crew. Initially, they, like everyone else were just having a good time. However, for whatever reason this woman began literally shrieking at the top of her lungs. I mean outright screaming. The first time was bad enough, but like an ill mannered, spoiled child she kept shrieking over & over. Eventually her friends turned their volume up as well, maybe in the effort to make hers seem less shrill, or maybe they were all jackasses. It was ridiculously ignorant, obnoxious and utterly lacking in respect for the room full of adults also attempting to enjoy themselves. Ultimately, the manager/bartender refused to serve the additional shots they'd ordered, he did not cause a scene (they were doing fine on their own) they were allowed to finish their drinks & discreetly informed by their waitress that they would not receive the shots they'd ordered. As any grown, decent adult would do they proceeded to make even bigger asses of themselves, but thankfully did leave with exception of one of the men who insisted on speaking with the manger, berating him & calling him names. He actually had the audacity to try to play the victim role, \"he was offended,\" claimed the bartender ruined their party. I suppose the fact that they were ruining the night of at least 50 other patrons was no matter.  Kudos to the wait staff and my gratitude to the manager for doing the right thing and salvaging our night!"}
{"text":"We stopped here on the way back from a cruise on Lake Mead.  I ordered the Dillinger burger and my wife ordered the special of the day--a burger with swiss cheese and mushrooms.  The burgers come with fries so there was no need to order a side of them.  We also got two iced teas.  I ordered my burger rare and that's the way it came.  The Dillinger is topped with applewood bacon, cheddar, and brisket.  The burger was good but some of the flavor got lost with the brisket.  I guess I'm going to go back to being more of a purist when it comes to burgers.  Adding a lot of toppings to make your burgers different from other restaurants is getting a little carried away.  My wife's burger was cooked medium as she wanted and there was lettuce and tomato for on the burger or for eating as a side which was what I did.  No more on top with the Dillinger.  For dessert, we shared a peach bread pudding with some vanilla ice cream.  It was tasty but nothing special.  Service was OK.  My iced tea was refilled several times without needing to ask.  The atmosphere is interesting with its Dillinger theme--a large photo of whom graces the bar area.  An OK place."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers and sandwiches. Yummy pulled pork sandwich with sweet potato fries with the chipotle aioli on the side.  Our order included a bacon cheeseburger, a very Big Grilled cheese and the firehouse chicken sandwich-all were very good. Located in the Historic section of Boulder City. We came into town after a great tour of the el dorado mine in Nelson."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out in Boulder City!!! Love the food, best sweet potato fries, best dessert- banana split cheesecake!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner with the family after taking the hoover dam tour. The service here was ok, the waiter didnt check on us as often as we would of liked. We went to the bar for refils on our drinks twice. But the food was good, everyone was happy with their dishes.  My husband has the philly steak sandwhich...his onlu complaint was there wasnt enough meat on the sandwich.  Mom had the brisket sandwhich, which she enjoyed and I had the black bean burger, it was alittle dry but I added a little chipotle sauce to it and it was great."}
{"text":"What a great stop.  Stopped in Boulder City overnight and found this restaurant/bar.  The food was really good.  I had the chicken strip sandwich and my husband had the grilled ham and cheese.  Both were good and hit the spot.  The atmosphere of the place is wonderful.  Very friendly staff and the owner came over and asked how everything was - such a rarity but very appreciated.  Good job on making our visit there a memorable one.  Thanks."}
{"text":"If you are ever in Boulder city you have to try this place. Nice small bar with good customer service and very good food. I tried that Dillingerhamburger which was really good. That hamburger had a very nice smoky flavor and the brisket that was on the hamburger was very tender. The soup of the day was a corn beef and cabbage soup. Never had anything like it but it was really good."}
{"text":"Get an appetizer order of chicken wings Dillinger style and thank me later. This place is great! You really can't go wrong with most of the items, if not all, on the menu. Perfectly cooked and portioned every time. Flavor is never missing even on the most plain items! A Boulder City must have."}
{"text":"My absolute, hands down, favorite place to dine in Boulder City! Can't go wrong with anything on their menu!"}
{"text":"Like everybody else said: Good burgers Cool toppings Ok prices Wide selection of beer Sit outside Boulder city cuteness Bloody Mary bar Bonus: good salads"}
{"text":"I usually read yelp reviews before I try any new place (bad ones first). So after some thought I decided to give it a whirl. I went with a couple friends in early afternoon. The place had a few patrons already in it. The decor was pretty awesome, shotguns on the door, all good and plays to the theme nicely. Waitress came over with the menus, I asked what beers she said on tap. Amazing selection of beers on tap. The waitress told me about a beer I've never tried (magic hat) and it was awesome! I ordered the Dillinger, friend #1 ordered the Bugsey, friend #2 ordered the Executioner. The waitress took the order on her phone, which was pretty cool, first time I've seen that. Food came out pretty quick. When she put the burger in front of me, I was amazed. My fries were cooked perfectly and the burger was top notch. Everything was super quality. The chef knows what's up, brisket was great. The manager came by are table to make sure everything was alright. I had one Rogue dead guy ale and one magic hat. When the bill arrived at the table I was scared to look at my portion but I was presently surprised that my meal did not break the bank. I'm glad this place exists. I will be back again and again.  I hate to read reviews that chastise places like this. One thing goes wrong and it's a two or one star review. It's people like that really steam my beans. Even after the manager or owner respond to your negative review, at least update the review."}
{"text":"I really love The Dillinger. It embodies everything I love about Boulder City, a chill place with good service and excellent food. There is outside seating, great for people watching when the weather is nice.   Anytime I am in the mood for a big, juicy burger I head here. The burgers are 1/2 pound monstrosities, made of high quality beef and cooked to my liking (medium). I get whatever the daily burger special is fairly often, but have also had the Bugsy (cheddar, bacon and fried onions) and even the Portabella burger was impressive (add avocado like the menu suggests!).   The owner is on site often, bringing out orders and checking in on guests... and while the place does get busy, service has always been really good on my visits. Sometimes patrons get a little drunk and rowdy, but never out of control and I appreciate that the inside isn't smokey like some bars. There are daily drink specials, a nice selection of locally brewed beers, and on Sundays The Dillinger has a DIY Bloody Mary Bar that I look forward to trying soon.   For anyone wondering where the beef is, it's in Boulder City at The Dillinger!"}
{"text":"I ate a hamburger here and didn't need a napkin, there is something wrong with that picture.   Now i am not saying i didn't use one, but i really didn't need it to be honest. I ordered their \"Baby Face Nelson\" burger and thank goodness it had the marmalade stuff on it as it would have been way to dry as is. It came out and \"looked\" good on the plate,but then i bit into it I immediately knew that this was not going to be an enjoyable meal. The burger was supposed to be cooked medium rare, and looked may be a medium but tasted like well done. I am not sure if its the quality of the meat or what, but it lacked very much in flavor as well (may want to season the meat more). The fries weren't terrible, and the service was just ok. Nothing more needing to be said, as there wasn't much more to this meal. Just will not return."}
{"text":"Good food, excellent service as always! Dan and I love this place!! Oh, and the Corona is ALWAYS ice cold!!"}
{"text":"Love this spot! They have lots of very unique named plates, including The Executioner and The 45. I love the theme of the restaurant, its funky and hip.  I ordered the portabello mushroom burger, with sweet potato fries and it was LEGIT! The sweet potato fries were so dang good, I highly recommend them. I also ordered the gouda mac n cheese bites, which were ridiculously divine! The food was fresh and funky, served up with a smile from our waitress.   We will most certuinaly be back, this spot is great for veggies and carnivores alike! #veggie4life #veggielife"}
{"text":"Did the Dillinger for lunch.... Very kool place to have a good burger. The feel and atmosphere were excellent and the burgers are well made.  If your close drop in you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Made the trek out to Boulder City and stopped by the Dillinger for drinks and dinner and I got to say you Boulder City residents are lucky this is in your neighborhood!  Came here on a Friday night with a friend and it was packed.  We luckily were able to find seating immediately at the bar.  The inside of the Dillinger from what I remember is actually pretty small; they do have a small patio area as well.  Our bartender who served us was extremely friendly and attentive.  She brought us out waters and took our drink orders right away.  They had an excellent beer selection and plenty of craft beers on tap too.   We Ordered: -The Dillinger Burger ($11) - burger with bacon AND brisket on it, my arteries already started clogging when I saw this on their menu, but it was delicious, the brisket on top was very tender and moist, the bacon was nice and crispy, the fries served with the burger were tasty too -The Executioner ($9) - burger served with sour dough bread, grilled onions, and a thousand island dressing, my friend ordered this and I had a bite, it was good, but I don't really like thousand island and I thought it made the bread a little soggy   If I ever find myself in the Boulder City area I will definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem!! Love the decor.. My favorite is the shotgun door handles"}
{"text":"I wanted SO bad to love this place but it just didn't happen. Here's how the night went...we walked in just after 9pm. We knew they closed at 10. There were 6 other people eating, two tables of two and two men at the bar. When we walked in, everyone turned around to look at us. It was like the music stopped playing and everyone turned to look to see what happened. It was so awkward! We aren't locals so maybe that's why? They were checking to see who was stepping on their turf? The girl behind the bar looked up from her cell phone and said, \"sit where you want.\" No hello. No welcome. Nothing. I turned to my husband and asked if were weren't supposed to be there or something. The vibe we got was so unwelcoming and cold. On to the food...we had heard about the sweet potato fries so we ordered those as soon as she dropped our menus off. They came out fairly quick but I am certain they were burnt. They were pretty much black and so dry. Not good at all. I wasn't feeling too hungry so we only ordered one burger. We got the The Capone with fries. It looked pretty good when it came out. The egg was cooked perfectly and we broke the yummy yolk all over the burger. I had two bites and the husband ate the rest. I wasn't a fan of the bacon as it had too much of a sweet flavor to it. Not a bad thing just not how I like bacon. My husband said it was a pretty good burger but nothing to write home about. The regular fries were delicious. As we were eating, a group of 5 people came in and sat down. The server walked to their table and made sure they knew the kitchen was closing soon. It was 9:30 at this point. I understand the desire to get people out of there but I thought it was rude. 30 minutes is plenty of time to order and get your food. Our server did keep my husbands soda filled which was good. She never checked on us though. I really wanted some ranch for my fries but never got the chance to ask. The check came to just over $20. I was disappointed in the burnt fries and the service. It's sad because their menu is impressive and there's potential for a really good burger. Probably won't make the trip out to BC to try again unfortuanley."}
{"text":"Place is much smaller than it looks and on Black Friday, it was a full house at 1pm and we had to wait for a table. The wait staff was very nice to us, but I could see how they can be a bit busy to do all the proper table side things. Not sure if it is really how busy they are, but it did seem like they had things together. They did a pretty good job at getting tables in an out, which is important when the place seems to be short on dining area.  Food is above average for sure. Want to go back and try some of the other menu items. It makes for a great stop after a visit to the Hoover Dam.  If they had more seating (bigger dining area), I think it would make for an all around better burger joint. The kitchen seems capable of handling a bigger restaurant and I would like to see them get the chance."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this restaurant! The burgers are excellent. They grind their beef fresh every morning and even offer whole wheat buns.  The service and their choices of draft beer were great!"}
{"text":"It was my husband's birthday, and we were in search of a really good burger. Nothing fancy, no kimchi or giant portions of any kind. Just a good old fashioned, tasty burger.   Our search led us to Boulder City. I really like the theme here, including burgers like 'The Bugsy', 'The Bonnie Melt' and 'The 45 Special', which is what my husband chose. The 45 Special comes with 3 types of cheese; Swiss, Cheddar and Jack. Ordered this medium rare and with a side of onion rings. I ordered from the appetizer menu, and got plain chicken tenders. I had the option of getting them 'mild' or 'spicy' as well. I chose the Ranch Dressing.   His burger came out exactly how he ordered it, and the onion rings looked fresh battered there at the restaurant. Unlike most places, they serve a good amount of onion rings. His burger came with lettuce, tomato and onion and was perfect as the juices started running down his arm as he bit into it.   I got 4 very large chicken tenders, heavily battered and fried to a crunchy texture. The meat itself was very juicy and tender. Their ranch was very flavorful as well.   The food here is really good. The theme inside is great. It was, however, a bit dark. It needed some warmth inside. It was hard to see everything, and the bar was also dark. Our waitress sat at the bar and texted, which is not cool. There are a few TVs showing various football games, and some outdoor seating on the sidewalk.   Fun place, but too dark for us."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Boulder City for a little \"Leaving Las Vegas\"-style bender/staycation. We got a room at the El Rancho motel, then stumbled down the road to drink the nite away at the succession of quaint little bars lining Main Street.  Alas, before we had even cultivated a stagger, the whole damn town started shuttering up! Bar after bar turned us away, like Joseph and Mary trying to find a room at the inn...until FINALLY, a shining star appeared in the east: Dillinger!  Thank christ this genteel establishment stays open late enough to cater to us debauched types. The place was packed with some kind of hipster bachelor party, plus one or two locals and a guy with a mic and a guitar playing rock covers. The bartendress had a very heavy hand, and the drinks were stiff and well priced.   I can't speak to the food, since this was an alcoholic bender staycation, and real alkies don't need solid nourishment other than olives and limes. But the atmo and drinks were great, and they let us stay until around midnight...considerably later than all those lame-ass bars on Main St.  Kudos to you, Dillinger."}
{"text":"On our roadtrip we looked for a not too pricey place with good food and found this place on the map, had good reviews, so we tried it. I liked the atmosphere, the service was great and it is in a cute part of town and best of all, the food was good. we had the Capone burger and the Bonnie melt, they both were excellent! the burgers were cooked just right and the portions were perfect. My only complaint would be their french fries weren't that great and they were luke warm. I think it was the manager or maybe even the owner that was out on the floor, serving food and seating people and I Really like to see that at restaurants. oh, the bathrooms were nice and clean too!"}
{"text":"Awesome menu and all are delicious. The \"45 special\" cheeseburger is amazing!  I'm a regular customer that orders takeout one to two times a week. I'm always friendly to the staff. However, I feel that the owner (Grant) either has some issue with me or he just has a slightly rude/standoffish personality. Also, the older waitress is always rude to me. I don't understand because I'm always a friendly person and never have this problem. All of the younger waitresses are great. Honestly, I wouldn't go if the food wasn't so good. I've never written something negative like this. It's not like me to do so, but unfortunately, in this situation I just felt like I had to. :(."}
{"text":"The bf is a burger NUT so this was a must eat location on the way back to Vegas from the Hoover Dam. When we showed up the place was pretty empty, we seated ourselves and got prompt service. Immediately after, however, the place filled up FAST for football watching (it is, after all, a bar). I had The Baby Face Nelson without the bun (no GF bun here - but that's not unusual) and it was DELICIOUS. The fig marmalade came on the side but I could see how if the same amount had been on the burger it would have been too much. The bf ordered The Capone and was not disappointed. It was oozing, messy and he enjoyed every second of it. The fries were just fries - nothing special, but not bad. The only thing that made me consider a 4 was that our service quality went down after the place filled up - which is completely understandable."}
{"text":"Tried 4 dishes and everything spot-on!  Food was hot, well seasoned, cooked well.  The best was the bbq brisket sandwich!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The service is always friendly. The food is worth the price and very tasty. I love the decor (can't be the old side by sides as door handles). They also have great beer on tap."}
{"text":"Great food unfortunately service not as great. Nothing terrible but waitress just not very friendly."}
{"text":"Above average bar food. Cute little place in Boulder. They had some cool Tara McPherson art on the wall. Worth checking out if you're in BC."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Boulder City. Default to Asian Chicken Salad but everything I've had is just delicious! Can do separate checks easily and staff is friendly!"}
{"text":"We have come here many times and thought the beer is good and service is warm, friendly and prompt ...the food and prices are inconsistent. After paying close to  $45 for 3 burgers and a bread pudding I am left feeling unsatisfied. All three burgers were not the correct temperature and the bread pudding to go had no vanilla sauce and rubbery. To boot one burger was for my dog who has eaten with us EVERY time. He gets just a burger patty and this time we were charged for the whole meal. Customer service is a thing of the past. Time to find a new favorite place in Boulder City!"}
{"text":"Burger joint/pub named after the notorious mobster, located in downtown Boulder City.  The downtown Boulder area looks like you stepped into the past with 1960's style motels and many places to shop and eat.  The Dillinger has outdoor and indoor seating. Outside seating does have misting fans. Indoors you can sit at a table or at the bar.  The bar selections are plentiful with the exception of frozen drinks or mojitos. I kept it simple with a glass of wine.  For my meal I tried the daily burger special: jalapeño bacon cream cheese burger. It was good but I asked for medium rare and it was on the well side of medium.  Friendly staff."}
{"text":"We come here as often as we can, but for sure during Art in the Park for my birthday week. Had the pulled pork with piranha coleslaw and it was absolutely fantastic. Not only is the food always incredible, but the service is top notch cause they're just great people. Have NEVER had a bad experience here except I can't eat all the food. Thank you for always my making my little BD visit good"}
{"text":"Tasty tasty. If you're looking for a place to grab some super tasty gastro pub food here's your place.   The decor is great and just love the shotguns as door pulls.   The patio is where we sat because we had brought our dog Cheese with us. Water bowls are out for the pups convince. The football game on was a bonus.   They do have a full bar and some awesome brews on tap. No. 9 is my favorite.   We had the mac and cheese bites to start and loved them. I had the spinach salad with chicken. I love this salad. It had so many nuts on it I'm concerned about their food costs.  My man had the brisket sandwich. Now you should know this man loves brisket. Loves it. He took his first bite and started singing its praises.   This is a rare occurrence and especially surprising because he had raved about the brisket the night before in another town.  I was so aghast that he was endorsing his meal because of the rarity. So you know it's good.   I would also suggest trying the sticky burger. Sounds gross is amazing.   I love this place!"}
{"text":"Friends and I came here for lunch after an 8 mile hike to Hoover Dam. Let me tell you, after that hike we were tired and hungry. Found this awesome place on Yelp and went to check it out. Atmosphere is chill and inviting. Small local bar vibe. Very attentive staff. Took care of us right away. Cheeseburgers are out of this world. I had the Bugsy burger. Grilled onions, bacon and cheese. It was so good! I devoured it so fast I didnt even have a chance to take a picture of it. My friends ordered wings and onion rings. Also good! Will be back if Im ever in Boulder City. Want to check out the Tavern next door too. All easy walking distance from one another. Great small town. Would love to visit again soon."}
{"text":"Whatever gin drink I got there, x2, was delicious and effective.  The meals were okay.   I think the $2 upcharge for onion rings is high. They're delicious, but the serving was slim. My brisket sandwich needed more horseradish sauce and the fajita soup tasted like poor man's homemade medly of veggies, chicken, and almost flavorless broth.   I feel like I should've tried a burger. The waitress was very friendly, but sparsely visited the table. I'd try again."}
{"text":"So many amazing burgers to choose from.  The Capone with a fried egg and sweet potato fries is a cure for the largest of appetites.  If your into Big sloppy burgers this is IT."}
{"text":"My son and I only went there once while we were in town but the sweet potato fries and the bread pudding were top notch.  Service was perfect."}
{"text":"The burgers are the best! The Dillinger is a must have burger with BBQ brisket on top..  Really cool atmosphere. Small town burger place with bar and live music."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and our dinner surpassed our expectations. Our party of six, ages 22 to 68, each tried a different hamburger. Excellent beef cooked to your liking. Spot on service, delicious food and thumbs up from all of us."}
{"text":"Came here because of the promise of good food. It didn't disappoint! I got the Chicken with a Twist wrap and my wife got the T(BLT)A sandwich. Both were great! I must admit I liked hers better than mine however I just really liked the grilled taste of her sandwich. All burgers and sandwiches/wraps come with choice of either fries or Asian slaw. Service was friendly and fast. The area was small and I could see how it could fill up quickly. We were here at 3 on a Monday but there were a surprising amount of people of people here. Would definitely come back to try more food!"}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin!! I'm a total foodie living in Las Vegas for the past 16 years.. And I've been looking to tell people where the best burger place is in Nevada and I have found it..seriously!!! Forget those high end burger spots on the Vegas strip, that's over rated junk. I won't wait 20 times in a IN & OUT drive thru but I'll drive 1 hour from my house to come eat a burger here... Mouth watering, cooked to perfection, the price,food placement and service.. The Dillinger is my number one burger spot in Nevada.."}
{"text":"We had just got done hiking gold strike hot springs and to say the least worked up a appetite and most definitely needed a cold beer!! We found this little gem and were all very happy about our new find.. great selection of craft beer, and if craft beer is not your thing they have $1 pbr drafts! BBQ pork sandwich and burgers were amazing!! And to top it off the music selection was on point!! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I wish the drinks in NYC could be as comparable when it comes to price vs. strength! As a traveling local, I visit The Dillinger as often as possible. The drinks are generously poured and the booze isn't floated. The staff is consistently polite and attentive. The Dillinger is a terrific place for both locals and tourists who are seeking a true reflection of the kind pillars Boulder City was built upon but with a sharper, more current edge."}
{"text":"Stopped in here after visiting the Hoover Dam. It's kind of hidden off to the side, very dark and cool. Very small and comfortable. Staff was very friendly. Got the BLT and a Burger with Magic Hat #9 on tap. Everything was delicious. Perfect little gem of a place to hit when passing through and don't want to deal with the mobs of LV casinos. Glad we took the time to look around BC."}
{"text":"Fun place to go in Boulder city. I went after the Boulder city art fair and the entire town was out plus everybody from Las Vegas I'm sure!!!  But despite it being so busy they really did a great job of getting everyone a table and serving them well. We chose to sit outside and of course it's very dog friendly outside so it was a little weird to be dining around all of these puppies but I was cool with that.  The burgers are great and I would highly recommend getting the Asian slaw instead of fries. It is not a mayonnaise-based sauce and it's really delicious. Another thing that should be noted is the manager's mother made all of the desserts which that day were two different types of cheesecake it was so good and it really made you feel good to know that the desserts were homemade."}
{"text":"Perfect Lunch!  Took the family to see the Hoover Dam.  Stopped to have lunch after.  Had the Baby Face Nelson Burger with Brie Cheese and Fig Marmalade!  With a Blu Moon"}
{"text":"This place highly recommend by a local and it did not disappoint. The restaurant is exactly what we were looking for. The menu had a great variety of unique burger combinations that you don't normally find.  So glad we came. Will surely be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome service with a good attitude. They have a dynamite selection from their bar. The menu is not exactly healthy food but if you're there to party you gotta cut loose a little bit. Prices are medium for the area but Boulder City always tends to be a little more expensive as it is an out of the way smaller town. I would definitely recommend trying them out."}
{"text":"Were still making this our weekly place to go for date night and I have to say its always as good as the beginning!  Consistency always the same from the service too the food.  That's a great and rare thing."}
{"text":"Not quite a dive bar, more cool with hints of dive. The wife and I stopped by here on an overnight visit to Boulder City. We wanted something within walking distance of the Boulder Dam Hotel, where we were staying. It doesn't get much closer than Dillingers.   The bar is decked out in '30s gangster with photos and motif paying appropriate homage to its namesake. I ordered a Pyramid Hef and the wife had a soda. The waitress apologized for the wait but we really hadn't noticed. It actually gave us time to look over the extensive menu.  I ordered the namesake Dillinger Burger and my wife ordered a blue cheese burger. The Dillinger was a nice sized patty with a large helping of bbq brisket heaped on top. It also came with cheese, sauce and the usual fixings. A nice serving of fries came with it. The burger was juicy, cooked to order and more (much more) than a messy handful. The flavor was excellent and the bun was obviously handcrafted. The fries were crisped had a unique flavor all their own.  Priced right, we came out of there, after a second beer, without breaking the bank. If you are in Boulder City's Old Town area, this is the place for a great brew and burger stop. We'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"We were heading back from the Grand Canyon to Las Vegas and all 4 of us were very hungry... We found the place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. It was the best choice! It was a Wednesday and still happy hour so we ordered chicken wings and fingers and their 1$ draft beer for a start... Everything was delicious and big portions. Then we tried their burgers... We liked the most The Dillinger but the others were great too! We would definitely recommend this place and would go back if we will be back in the area."}
{"text":"A great place to stop in historic downtown Boulder City. We have gone twice when in town to visit family and plan on visiting again on our next trip as well. Definitely a must stop place. Go early and check out the antique stores walking distance. Try the Baby Face Nelson Burger (Brie, arugula, and fig marmalade) it is my favorite. Top off your meal with the manager's mom's homemade cheesecake, it was delicious!"}
{"text":"I came here a year ago for a beer after running bootleg canyon.  When I was there I noticed the burgers people were ordering and I was dizzam I want one of those.  Fast forward to Friday August 26 2016.  Went back here to finally get a burger.  I ordered the Dillinger burger....bacon cheese beef brisket top this burger....it was good!  The fries were on point to.  They have Craft Hause beers there to so this place is a must if you are hungry or thirst in Boulder City....Keep it up Dillenger!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of much in Boulder City these days. So much so that I'm glad I-11 will bypass the place. But The Dillinger is going to be one of the reasons why I will hop off I-11 and it's all because of one burger. Their signature burger, the Dillinger. When ordered with a side of sweet potato fries...I was hooked. And I've not had anything quite like it anywhere else.   Location: Downtown Boulder City. Ample parking close by.  While they have outside seating we chose to eat inside. It's definitely a bar first and foremost with TV's, loud conversations and all the usual things you would expect.  Service: It seemed like it took longer than I would have liked to get our order but otherwise we were seated promptly, drinks were refilled without having to ask, and we got service with a smile which is always a plus.   As for the food, yeah they have a menu with some interesting choices but their signature burger is why we'll go back. 1/2 pound of beef cooked perfectly with brisket that the staff at Fox Smokehouse BBQ needs to go try to see just how good brisket can be.   4 Stars. Just writing this has me craving it again."}
{"text":"Had \"The \"Executioner\" it was awesome,  melted Jack Cheese and grilled onions with Thousand Island dressing on grilled Sourdough bread and sweet potato fries served all hot and fresh. This was topped off by Rogue Amber Ale, great meal served hot and fresh!"}
{"text":"Great service, good drinks.  The decor is a little dark, but the food and drink overwhelms the bad points. I had the beef salad.  The sirloin was cooked to perfection (very rare) and the blue cheese dressing was excellent, with plenty of large cheese crumbles for effect. My wife had the patty melt with onion fries.  She is the queen of patty melts, and said this was THE best she'd had ever.  The onion rings were good too. Don't miss this one!"}
{"text":"Boulder City, Nevada ---  Day 98 \"DUSA Tour 2016\"   \"The Dillinger\" was recommended by local LaDana ...  primarily an eatery with a bar, it is not a \"Run-A-Way Bill\" Favorite ...  features gourmet burgers & micro-brew beers ...  lunch  crowd was busy so bartender/server Kenzi was on-the-move ...  Kenzi did not know the year \"Dillinger\" opened and that was not good ...  bartenders need to know their business history!!!  #RunAwayBill #DUSATour2016 #LivingLarge   \"Run-A-Way Bill\" was here!   08.18.16"}
{"text":"I really expected more after reading all the reviews. We stopped here on the way from Vegas to LA. I had a Chicken sandwich, and my boyfriend had the bugsy. My sandwich? Amazing. Spicy, but really great. The sweet potato fries are the bomb!   Now the downside, my boyfriend asked for his burger medium-rare and when it arrived it was raw. The staff were incredibly accommodating and said that he'll have a new one in a bit. When the burger arrived, it turns out that they took the same patty that he had earlier and tossed it back on the grill. Cheese and all. I've honestly never experienced anything like this in my life. Even the garnishing with a bite out of it made it back to our table.  Would it really have killed them to remake it?   The one thing that's keeping this from being a 1 or 2 star review is the service. The staff were friendly and accommodating. There was a loud, obnoxious gentleman at the bar and they promptly asked him to leave when he was disturbing other customers."}
{"text":"Still probably the best place in Boulder to eat period. Today I was overwhelmed with the smoke from people smoking outside though. They need to make the outside seating NONSMOKING PLEASE !!!! I almost got up and left."}
{"text":"I do like this place. The food is good, the wait staff are friendly, and even though it is small you can still find a seat. I did come in recently and had the chili and it was not good, but of course not everything can always be to our liking. Overall a good place to go."}
{"text":"Sometimes inconsistent food, but I always love coming here. Friendly owner and staff. Love the artichoke app and loooove the bread pudding. Good beer list, but I don't think they go through enough wine to keep it fresh."}
{"text":"Great place. Nice local vibe. Friendly staff. Nice staff. Enjoyed their stout!!! Fine to bring families here. Food servings  are very generous."}
{"text":"Do yourself a huge favor and try this place.   Greatest burger I've ever had.   The Dillinger burger was my favorite but the Burger with peanut butter on it was a close second"}
{"text":"It's small but really good. Moved to BC recently and working our way through all the places. This goes near the top of the list. Unpretentious, friendly, casual with a focus on good pub food where sandwiches rule. The burgers are the big deal and the Dillinger signature burger is great. Big burger, cheese, bacon and then really tender BBQ brisket. Sounds like over load but it's really a good fit of ingredients. You may want to share. I was impressed with the salads (to act like I was at least a little healthy). The side salad and the chicken finger salad are good sized with mix of greens and good dressings you don't normally get from places like this. I cost it a star due to very small size and just a few TVs. Not a slight but if you have to wait for a table and can't see lots of games in a sports pub - well..."}
{"text":"Service has gone downhill. Females in their are not very welcoming.  I used to like this place.  But not anymore.  Food is good service is bad. That's enough for me to stay away.  When staff is constantly changing it's obviously management /owner issues.  Maybe they will get it together before the bypass opens up.  Till then, I'll make my own bypass from this place."}
{"text":"The food was good. I had the portabella burger with avocado. My husband had the firehouse chicken sandwich and he loved it. The atmosphere is great, music playing in the background and it's not loud. We were surprised when we got the check of how fair the prices were. We definitely will return."}
{"text":"We have been trying different places to eat in Boulder City because we like to walk around the downtown area. Its a nice change from the business of Vegas.  My GF and I gave this place a try after a recommendation from a Boulder City local.   Its a very small restaurant with a nice vibe to it. The entrance doors have two shot guns for door handles which was very cool.  Inside there is lots of John DIllinger memorabilia all over the walls.  I really wanted to like this place!  The burger menu items were named after mobsters. it was kinda kitschy but cool.   All the tables but one were taken. It was pretty busy. We were welcomed by a bartender who also was waiting tables. She said she would be with us in a minute and it was more like 10. I am very patient but my patience was being pushed a little.   We watched another customer who came in after us sit at the bar and order before us. By this time it had been about 15 minutes. We did get our drinks and she finally took the order.  I ordered the Dillinger burger which was a burger with cheddar, smokey bacon and BBQ beef brisket on it. I decided to have a side of asian style slaw instead of fries.  There wasn't much for my vegetarian gf to eat. She had the chopped salad with all the meat on the side.   And we split the sweet potato fries. I asked the server if they could make them without the cinnamon sugar and she said yes. Maybe i didn't make it clear, but there was a breakdown in the communication and they came out with the cinnamon sugar on them. The server never came back and checked up on us. The cook came out looked around and looked at me, just as I was going to tell him about the fries, he turned and walked away. I decided to get up and find someone to fix the fries. There was another server there and I flagged her down. She was very friendly and said bringing another order out wouldn't be a problem.   The server/bartender came out with the re-made fries. She was almost argumentative about  if i had asked for them without the topping. Her exact words were \"we talked about it\". Cmon, really???This was also when she did the check back. We were almost done with our meals.  (Thank you fellow Yelpers for putting up with this wordy story)  So the salad was the type that was just shredded iceberg, the kind of stuff you would expect in a taco. The dressing was ok but it certainly wasn't worth $9.75.   The burger was very good. They use fresh top round beef and they are 1/2 pound patties. All the flavors really married well. You can't go wrong with 3 kinds of meat on a burger i always say.  The slaw, meh. Pretty flavorless.  In the end, the service was pretty poor, with the exception of the other server who helped us, she was great.  The food was pretty ordinary and just didn't impress us that much.  This place has a lot of potential. Maybe the owner should pay more attention to how important great service is to keep your customers happy.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"I had to pick a place in Boulder City to meet my in laws for lunch. Being I have never been to Boulder City I thankfully have Yelp my trusted guide. Well it didn't disappoint the location is central in downtown with plenty of free parking out front. Upon entering you are immediately greeted and directed to your table. There is outside seating but it was a little too cold outside.   We ordered drinks and food. My in laws both ordered the fish n chips that was on special, my husband chicken wings and myself a chopped salad. The portion sizes are too big to finish. My mother in law gave me her fish and it was delicious. Surprisingly not too greasy being fried. My chopped salad was delicious I could have sat and at it all day. It was beautifully cut my Mother in law said there is scissors you can get that will do that for you. I need to find them as this was great. We all skipped dessert as we were too full.   I took photos of the front door which the door handles are rifles and they had beautiful decorative wall tiles. I can see myself as a regular if I lived near by. Will definitely be back on my next visit to Boulder City."}
{"text":"Excellent place!! Great burgers!! Cold beer! Sweet potato fries are he best! Good onion rings too!! Nice cool atmosphere... great service!!! Definitely worth the stop!!!"}
{"text":"We left full and completely satisfied. Great service along with outstanding barbecue."}
{"text":"Nice burger and good selection of beer. Three for me means I would come back."}
{"text":"The food: Burgers we asked for \"medium\"  There was NO pink whatsoever  Definitely overcooked.  The fries were good.  We had a party of four. We got two Dillinger's, Bonnie melt : was just mediocre and dry.  They were out of the crafthaus beer.  They were out of ALL desserts.  Then they stated they had the s'mores lava cake but no ice cream. So I asked for a discount on the lava cake and the manager plain out said \"nope sorry\".  And also  we asked for a military discount and they gave us 10 percent on ONE item instead of the whole price.. I was shocked! This place seems very obsessed with profit and money.  We will never ever come again."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!!!!  This place is great.  We were on a 3 week road trip during a major heat wave in the southwest a couple weeks ago.  Just to stay in a place with a/c (we had been camping), we ended up staying 2 days in Boulder City.  We were referred to The Dillinger by about 4 different people, and I love old 30's gangster history, so we decided to try it.  The front doors alone with shot buns for handles were the coolest!   Then we walked in, and it got even better.  It's dark inside The floors are dark brown, maybe black?  and the walls a charcoal grey.  Big photo of John Dillinger on the wall with a busted looking face.  the whole vibe of the place is great gangster bar, meets old west meets gastro pub.  It totally worked!!  I was craving a burger, and for some reason, I decided on a veggie burger.  BEst veggie burger i have ever had anywhere, hands down.  Sour dough roll, fluffy and not tasting processed like most burger joints.  I also got an apricot beer, cold and delicious after coming in out of the 112 degree day. $8 for the veggie burger, and a bargain at that!  My husband got the Capone.  Cheddar and jack cheeses, applewood bacon, special sauce and a fried egg.  $10.75.  He also got a PBR on draught.  I think he was channeling his inner hipster that evening.  He said the burger was delicious, and he menitoned it a couple times afterward during our vacation.  Our daughter got the chicken fingers and fries for $5 - As the menu says, child size, unless your child is huge....which she's not, so she had leftovers to take back to the hotel.  Cold beers, great burgers and a cool environment!  What else could you ask for?  They lose 1 start for slow service.  I'm not sure if it's because I am used to busy bay area service where they get you in and out quick, but it seemed like it took awhile for the food, and our beers were gone before the server asked if we wanted another...which we both did.  She kind of disappeared when we were going to ask her for the check as well.  But, the service was not slow enough that I wouldnt go back.  if we ever go through Boulder City again, you can bet we will stop by The Dillinger"}
{"text":"The best burgers in town !!!! and also a great bloody Mary bar with crispy bacon for your bloody Mary !!!!"}
{"text":"I won't go into a long drawn out story about our experience today. I will say that my family have visited numerous times and we ALWAYS recommend the Dillinger to friends and literally anyone we run into. Food is fantastic and never tried anything I didn't like. But I have never walked out of an establishment feeling the way I did today. Point of advice, if you like to be spoken to like you're a child and in an extremely condescending manner for wanting your appetizer before your entree, then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Did a little bit of Yelping and found this place after a couple hours of ziplining in Boulder City. The thing that reeled me in was the massive IPA selection. Hooked!  It was a bit dark and small, not what I expected when we first walked in. But, still such a cute spot! Reminiscent of the old divey saloons in a historic part of town. Noticing that it was a bar, I wasn't expecting much out of the food.  However, the Sticky Burger special with peanut butter was surprisely good. Portion size was buck-bangin, and the IPA selection was plentiful. The waitress was super sweet and patient even with me 'huh'ing, 'can you repeat that 1st IPA,' and 'what was that 2nd one again'. The sweet potato fries had some kind of cinnamon sugar sprinkled on, which was too sweet for my liking.  Great location with nice portions of bar food that exceeds typical bar food expectations. I doggie bagged half my burger because between the burger, fries, and IPA, I would've walked out of there with a 5 lb food baby."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Dillingers food especially their chopped salad and sweet potato fries. They also have a great variety of burgers. Don't forget to read their menu, it is pretty comical."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers, great service, awesome music on the weekends and from what I've heard, great drinks! This is the place to go for dinner or a night out in Boulder City. Try the Capone burger and the sweet potato fries!!!"}
{"text":"The service was good. Everyone was nice but with only two servers they took a while getting back to us.   The food... I got The Executioner and it was good. The meat is fresh, a little more sauce would've been good. I also ordered sweet potato fries and they weren't good. They looked like the crinkle frozen fries you buy at the store.  The bar itself has a cool vibe though with some eclectic decor. If I was just coming to drink I think I would've gave it 4 hours."}
{"text":"Man, we were hungry!  Today, we decided to hike the Black Mountain trail in Boulder City.  It took a whopping 4 hours to complete. By the time we returned back to our cars, we were starving and wanted to check out a little piece of the city.  We're never in Boulder, so this was the perfect opportunity.    This place is located next to an antique store and across the street from the local theater.  You'll notice that there are tabletops lining the outside of the restaurant.  That's for a very good reason. The inside is VERY small.  Once you walk in, there's a bar and at most, 6 tables to choose from.  We got there early and chose a high pub style table.  The place was quaint:  dark walls, eclectic artwork - tile panel montages, sculptures, wooden bar shelves, bottles displayed at the bar.  There's even rifles to show the old town character of Boulder City. Our server's name was Tracy.  She was sweet, asked us if we wanted to split our checks which surprised me in a good way.  At one point though, she did forget one of our plates and needed some reminder.  It was probably because it got busy pretty fast.    For lunch, I started with the small house salad for $4.25.  It was actually pretty big for a small house salad.  Mixed greens, lined with tomato and cucumber slices, topped with sunflower seeds, red onions and croutons.  All components were great and offered different flavors.  I chose bleu cheese for my dressing which came on the side.  It was the star of the show, for sure!  This bleu cheese was a little sweeter than what I was used to which made it awesome!  For lunch, I got the 45 Special burger for $8.75.  What caught my attention was the small bit on the menu which said that this was the cheesiest burger in Boulder City, voted by the World Burger Judging Council of Burgers. It was a big patty, topped with Cheddar, Jack and Swiss cheese on a bun.  Served with lettuce, tomato and onions on the side.  For your side choice, you can choose fries or an Asian cole slaw. The slaw was sweet and a little spicy.  It was great, although the slaw dressing, which I think was vinegar based, was a little soupy.  The burger was charred very well.  It offered a lot of smoky flavor.  Tracy our server said they usually make medium burgers.  My only disappointment was that it came more well done.  I should have ordered a medium rare burger.  No worries, because the cheese definitely made up for it!  Lots of gooey cheese!  Great choice for this place!  If you're ever in Boulder City, you should really check this joint out.  I enjoyed it and I'm sure you will as well.  They also have a $7 bloody Mary bar which I fully intend to try on my next visit!  Thanks for some great times, Dillinger :)"}
{"text":"Such a hidden gem! My go to place whenever I'm in Boulder City, sometimes I'll even make the long drive from Vegas just to come here to eat and have a drink. They have great craft beer selections, plus awesome Bloody Mary bar on Sundays!   Great service, very clean, great food (if you love wings, you must order the Dillinger wings! Not on the menu.). The staff actually wants to be there and enjoy what they do, you can see it through the service.   The ambiance is modern and hip, you can tell the owner takes pride in the establishment. Nice patio area to enjoy the nice weather and people watch.   Definitely a must if you're ever in or passing through Boulder City!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a scrumptious brisket sandwich on a fresh-baked roll with crisp, well-seasoned, piping hot fries and creamy coleslaw.  Hubby had the pulled pork, which was also delish.  It's our 4th time eating here and we love it."}
{"text":"This place is a cool spot to hang out and enjoy live music. You can tell they had their regulars and mostly everyone seemed to know each other. We tried one of their special drinks that was in a small barrel in the back of the bar. I don't remember the name but it was pretty strong but smooth."}
{"text":"I had the Capone which was one of the best burgers I have ever eaten, great food and ice cold beer what else could you ask for."}
{"text":"Overrated. Go somewhere else. Ambience, sat outside with a swarm of flies. Service, food took a while and then after getting our food, we were not given any utensils or napkins. Had to stop my lunch and go inside and ask for them. Waitress was unapologetic. Also it's a drink place and I was not given a drink menu. Now for the food, ordered a turkey burger that had Asian slaw which was clearly a packaged version from your local supermarket. It was a soggy mess. Sweet potato fries were too sweet and tasted of the ore ida variety. Definitely will not be coming back, largely due to the lack of service first and then the food. Plenty of other options in the area that surely will be better than this."}
{"text":"I Love the grilled artichoke and steak salad! It's so good! My son is a sticker burger fan! And the sweet potato fries are  addicting! I Eat there at least once a week:) love this place!"}
{"text":"I don't normally right reviews and I am not a burger fan but this was 1 of the best burgers I have ever had. I ate the whole thing. Great service. Defiantly going back."}
{"text":"Friendly faces Great food!!  Gotta try the Homemade Bread pudding. Amazing! I have been here several times and it never disappoints."}
{"text":"The Dillinger is a great spot that my boyfriend and I used to love to go to when we wanted to get out of Vegas for the afternoon. Great veggie burger, a unique, relaxed vibe that is hard to find in Vegas, good beer selection, friendly staff. Well worth the short drive out to Boulder City to check out. I'm really torn up about this, but I don't think I'll be coming back here after our last experience.  When we arrived the place was pretty full. Saturday evening, to be expected. An older white haired, heavy set guy (manager? owner? host?) tells us there's only seats available at the bar or outside on the patio. I glance at an open table next to him and he explains that he wants to save the 6-top in case a large group comes in. I'm not a fan of sitting at the bar I tell him, I prefer a table, but no worries, we sat outside, they had misters, it was fine. Our server was absolutely delightful, a young guy with an infectious smile, super friendly, we both loved him. Everything was perfect, food came out and it was great, we were enjoying our meal as usual until the band started up. I should have noticed the band set up before we sat down, but I didn't think anything of it. I have a hard time with loud noises and this was WAY too loud for my comfort. I sat with it for a few songs until it became too much for me. I asked the white haired guy from before if we could be moved inside. There's only seats at the bar, he tells me. I tell him no thanks, I take my last few more bites of my veggie burger and go inside to ask our sever for our check and use the restroom. That's when I see three open tables there. I was just floored that this guy would lie right to my face and tell me there are no tables. Two of the three were set, too, one was that 6-top that hadn't been seated since we came in. I look at the tables, look at him, and shake my head in disgust. I have never felt so worthless as a customer. If this was some random spot I'd never been to before, I'd have written it off and not cared so much, but The Dillinger really was one of my favorite places, and I can't go back there if this white haired guy will be there. Seriously heartbroken. You won, white haired guy. You will never have to waste a table on me again.   Three stars because this is a really, really awesome (5 star) place to check out except for one really really horrible person there who has ruined it for me. :-/ Shoot me a message if he ever leaves, I'll go back with bells on."}
{"text":"What a awesome little pub in Boulder City.   We came out to check the dam and the Pat Tillman bridge.   Then we hit Hemenway park.  Then we ended up at this awesome pub.  Great beer selections and awesome food.  I was very impressed with our server Amy.   We had the blazin wing, chili, artichoke dips and a few beers.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great place for a sandwich and cold craft beer or beverage. Our waitress Stephanie, was awesome and very attentive to anything we might need. She even got me an ice tea to go, as their fresh brewed was perfect! Historic former bank transformed into a cute restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is Amazing and the Bartender Kenzie was friendly and knowledgeable.  The atmosphere is laid back and very welcoming. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"This place was delicious!  My girlfriend and I shared the chicken wings, The Dillinger burger and the Al Capone (it was real messy).  A great location to people watch and enjoy a burger and beer.   The servers were really attentive.  Our main server was super sweet and the two other gentlemen that helped her were all super cool and on the ball.  I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"I wish Boulder City wasn't 30 minutes away. The Dillinger burger is amazing!"}
{"text":"As always the food is great and service is equally awesome. Our bartender Zach was super friendly. This place is a must stop if you are in Boulder City. You won't be disappointed and if you are then you have bigger issues than appreciating good food and drink. Tonight the Dillinger had a full selection of Dogfish Head all the way up to the 120 minute IPA."}
{"text":"Dan the manager is awesome!! Sweet potato fries are to die for!!! Always a stop for us whenever we are in Boulder City Nevada which is about a half a dozen times a year!!!"}
{"text":"Came in with high expectations, but the food ended up saving the day!  PARKING: public lot (free!)  FOOD: -chicken trip sandwich: this sandwich was super delicious and had a generous portion of chicken. the chicken strips were nicely fried, and the veggies were fresh (considering we're in the middle of a desert!). -sweet potato fries: fries had a nice crunch. the topping of brown sugar sealed the deal for me.  SERVICE:  we came after a triathlon, so it seemed that the place was pretty busy. after about a 20 minute wait, the host said that we could either squeeze at a 4 person table (we had a party of 6) or wait for the next available 6 person table. we were already starving and of course opted to squeeze. it took about 10 minutes for someone to bring our menus and then another 10 minutes to take our drink order. another 5 minutes to take our food order. it was either they were severely understaffed or were simply not used to the rush. in the end, the food made up for the subpar service!"}
{"text":"Everything we have ever had there has been fantastic.  The food it made fresh to order. Our family went there on a Weekday and it was no only not as crowded but the chatter wasn't as loud as usual. Great service each time we go. Happy as they kept our Sodas full."}
{"text":"First time here and my husband and I had a great experience. I had the guacamole bacon burger and he had lobster bisque soup and both were amazing. I would definitely recommend this place if you like a fun atmosphere with good music and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Food was amazing!!! We had the Dillinger burger and the Capone burger. Can't go wrong with either one. Our server was Amy and she was awesome!!!! Very friendly staff and kid and dog friendly. Did I mention the food was DELICIOUS!!!!"}
{"text":"I arrived in town late, and was lucky enough to arrive before the kitchen closed down (well before closing time).  I had a sandwich that was pretty good.  Lots of fries that were good.  Nothing great.  Nice enough place in a town that doesn't have a lot of downtown options.  Good beer selection as well."}
{"text":"Good food, good beer, cool theme! Definitely worth a visit if you're in Boulder City."}
{"text":"I eat at the Dilinger about once a week, maybe every other week.  I love it because I always find something yummy as a vegetarian, and my meat-eating friends can indulge in some meaty sandwiches.  My favorite is the portabello burger witht asian slaw.  My mom's standard is the salad (half portion) with chicken, and my friends rave about the burgers with sweet potato fries.  Good food, good service, and you can take your time or be in and out."}
{"text":"Found ourselves here after the Boulder wine walk. The promise of a veggie burger was what led me here, but the cool exterior of the bar coupled with the patio dining sealed the deal. When we arrived it looked like a band was setting up. Unfortunately, we didn't get to enjoy the music since our stay here was cut short by my extremely inebriated friend!  THE VEGGIE ($8.00): A basic black bean burger with tzatziki sauce and served with french fries. I took one bite before my friend ran outside to get some air. My husband ended up getting this to-go for me and I ate most of the burger on the drive home. *Doesn't come with cheese 3/5  HOUSE SALAD ($7.25): Husband ate it but says it was meh. Probably should have got a burger instead! 3/5  The Dillinger is popular, has clean bathrooms, and has a dog-friendly patio. The veggie burger was just okay - I'll try my luck with the portobello sandwich next time!  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2016: #74"}
{"text":"This place has amazing burgers. I suggest trying the sticky burger at least once. The staff is very nice and helpful. The atmosphere is also appropriate."}
{"text":"A surprising little gem in downtown Boulder City, The Dillinger boasts good service with very good food.  The steak salad I ordered was worth the wait and the beer selection was fairly impressive.  Kudos to the restaurant, too, for their honesty and followthrough.  I left my credit card there after paying for my to-go order.  Realizing it the next morning, I called the restaurant and the voice on the other end confirmed they still had my card.  Since I didn't live in the area they were kind enough to drop it in the mail and send it off to me to save me the 1 1/2 round trip drive to swing by and grab it.  This place has earned my return business."}
{"text":"I've been waiting to try this restaurant for almost 2 years now. Finally after a really good workout through the railroad tunnels I talked my friend into trying THE DILLINGER. Immediately I went to the bathroom to wash my hands and thought it was great there was a promotional hand scrub for customers to use! How cool was that?! I'd seen so many pictures from Yelp that I knew for sure I was gonna try the sweet potato fries. From the start of ordering everything just sucked! The lemonade was fountain lemonade that has that awful powder after taste. I ordered the seafood bisque, just to compare it to previous other seafood bisque I had tried. The color reminded me of the SALMON Crayola crayon I never colored with as a kid. It was so luke warm, and tasted BLAH! It had to be sitting on a steam table and ladeled into the bowl. Culinarians (Yes I said it) know you ladel the bisque into a sauce pan, simmer it until hot, adding whatever flavor, THEN pour it into the bowl and garnish it! Ughhhh!  My friend wanted WINGS (cuz it's kinda hard to mess that up) but I talked him into trying something new. He got THE CAPONE, and me not wanting to deviate too much from my healthy eating, I chose THE PORTOBELLA. I customized it, and made it into a PBLT, with avocado. When the food arrived I had a new found hope. The food \"LOOKED\" amazing! My SP fries were hot and crispy too! After we each took a bite of our food our hearts sank! His burger patty was charred giving the burger a really disgusting flavor, and his fries tasted like CLAMS. Yikes! Thank God he had no shell allergy! Believe it or not, just because I used to cook 5***** food doesn't mean I always have to eat it. I enjoy decent normal food too, but my biggest pet peeve is COLD FOOD. I suppose my Shroom was done before his burger but who says you can't keep it on the grill, hit it with some water for steam and put it on the bun at the last minute? DOUBLE Ughhhh!  I don't know what happened?! I was expecting this amazing experience! It was soup, a burger, a mushroom, and some fries for heavens sake! (Frozen sweet potato fries, not fresh) How hard is it... expecially with only 3 tables dining!  I honestly would have enjoyed McDonald's and it would have been worth the extra gym time. As always, even though we were bummed TO THE MAX, we still were friendly and left a good tip."}
{"text":"We were in Boulder City after bringing a friend to Hoover Dam and were looking for lunch.  As we strolled through the town we came across Dillinger's and were impressed by the outdoor seating and the hip decor.  We decided to give it a shot.    Service was very good.  The menu was full of interesting burger and sandwich options - you can stick with the norm or try some unique dishes.  I really liked the asian slaw as a side and their fries were delicious!  I tried a chicken finger sandwich, my husband had the Dillinger, and our friend had a brisket sandwich.  Everyone enjoyed their meal.  They seemed to have a good beer selection - my husband was able to get Magic Hat #9 on tap, which he doesn't get very often.    Overall this was a great local joint and I would definitely come here again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Greatest spinach salad in town -- so far.  Actually, the only spinach salad I've been able to find. But it is big and full of pecans and cranberries and blue cheese.  It is a good one. Cute little sidewalk cafe/ bar restaurant inside.  Groovy rifles for door handles. I love the Wild Wild West."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat & drink in Boulder City. I live in nearby Las Vegas, NV and often find myself making the short 20 minute journey to Boulder City just for The Dillinger. The food is out of control good!  The beer is cold and they have a rotating tap that keeps it interesting. The staff is extremely attentive. Even the owner is seen socializing with patrons ensuring a good experience."}
{"text":"Not that this place needs another amazing review but i must post one. Got some sort of asian chicken wrap. My husband got a cheese burger and we were both impressed. We were just stopping in after visiting the hoover dam. The staff gave the place a nice small town feel. Thank you for being a good stop on vacation."}
{"text":"Sweet potato fries are awesome, I had the Dillinger burger it was huge vary good with cold PBR. one of my new favorite spots"}
{"text":"Every time that I come in to town my family comes here. Usually the service is great! However, this time, not so much. The servers were not engaged in helping our party and hardly checked in on us. The manager (I think) came by to see how things were going but it had been foreverrrrr since we ordered and nothing came if his visit. If this place is going to continue to be a go-to place for me and my family, they need to step up their service. Get some servers who want to make the customer HAPPY!! I hope that this review helps management take notice of the poor quality of service and make some changes so that when I come back everything is back to the way it was..."}
{"text":"We stopped here on the way to Lake Mead because this is one of my friend's favorite places to eat. I came in with high expectations, and was disappointed. It's a small bar with limited inside and outside seating. The inside was full, so they seated us outside. It was a nice breezy day, so that was fine by me.  I ordered fried calamari and fries, while my friends ordered the burger special and a salad. The service was slow, and our server barely checked on us. I don't drink a lot when I go out to eat, so my glass didn't need to be refilled as often. Otherwise, I'd probably be thirsty throughout the whole meal.  The fries were crunchy. The calamari were okay, but nothing special. It's a nice place to stop by and eat, but I wouldn't drive out of the way just to visit."}
{"text":"Yum. The Dillinger burger was very good. They don't have pickles for the sandwiches but who cares. You can compensate when it is really good. The Dillinger style hot wings were good too."}
{"text":"In a nutshell, we would go back.  My wife and I liked the BBQ brisket sandwich and The Executioner (a patty melt sandwich with grilled onions and cheese on sourdough bread).  The Executioner was juicy and delicious and the BBQ sandwich had a plentiful amount of brisket on the fresh bun.  My wife ordered the onion rings and I ordered the fries. They were both processed/frozen and, to me, nothing special. Next time I will opt for their Asian slaw.   We arrived at 12:15 on a Saturday. Although our waitress \"ran her buns off\" they could have used a buss boy."}
{"text":"Asked the Hotel for great Burgers and ended up at the Dillinger. Easy going place with a nice beer selection. We had the Dillinger burger and it was good. I missed that it had brisket on it and I don't really like brisket... Scraped it of and the burger was great. Fries perfect and ranch dressing wonderful!"}
{"text":"Good casual place to have lunch after visiting Hoover Dam. Loved by locals. Great service, nice portions. Burgers are very good. Terrific on tap beers."}
{"text":"Through the act of locating The Dillinger, I discovered that Boulder City has a pretty neat little downtown area (who knew?).  The food is fantastic, great atmosphere, and we had a wonderful waitress who handled our large group with ease.  This will definitely be my go-to stop when traveling through Boulder City in the future."}
{"text":"Fantastic meal! The Dillinger burger is awesome! Bisque amazing! Artichoke is great! Just a fantastic lunch!!"}
{"text":"Everything we've tried on the menu has been plentiful and delicious. The drinks are reasonably priced and the atmosphere is always fun and friendly. They have a sidewalk patio with fans and misters that make it enjoyable and family friendly out there. I highly recommend the Asian salad--the dressing was amazing!"}
{"text":"This has to be one of my favorite places so far.  Had lunch here on my 30th birthday.  The food was amazing!  The fries were perfect and the chicken was so moist.  Amazing service, interesting menu, cute decor and very clean.  Don't pass this place up."}
{"text":"Our waitress/bartender was phenomenal.  Atmosphere is cool and prices are good.  Unfortunately that was the best the part.  Burgers were average at best and menu was incorrect in a few places.  Dessert was not very good, either.  Hate to be a downer but was disappointed."}
{"text":"Food Average with above average wait times.  We waited 40 minutes on Sunday for our food.   Waitress was very forgetful, and had to make numerous extra trips.   Waited for ladies facility and noticed cleaning supplies on the floor by food prep area/condiment station."}
{"text":"Great burgers!  Came during the day on recommendation from staff at Boulder Dam. Both adults and kids loved it. Excellent cheesecake too!  Service was fast and attentive."}
{"text":"Hubby and I usually share nowadays, so I get the Oriental Chicken Salad and he gets a burger. Perfect amount for two. They have a great selection of burgers and they are FANTASTIC! Full bar and make your own Bloody Mary Bar on weekends. TVs for sports and sidewalk dining. Great place!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! I randomly picked it based on other reviews because I was starving after visiting the Hoover Dam. It's not out of the way if you're heading back towards Las Vegas strip. The burger was amazing and the outdoor seating area was great because it had a heater and TVs. The service was fast and the prices I thought were reasonable. It's a quiet town on the weekends, but there was a fun antique store nearby that was fun to shop around in."}
{"text":"Such a great place in Boulder City!  I've heard so much about The Dillinger that my Mom and I decided to have dinner there on a Monday night.  It's very easy to find - located in the main business district, on Arizona, just off Nevada Hwy (main road).  There is plenty of street parking around, so it shouldn't be too hard to find a spot.  It's a small place, but not as small as I pictured based off other reviews.  There are probably around 6-8 tables outside and 8 inside.  There is also a large bar when you enter.  Speaking of the bar - they have an awesome beer selection!  The night I was there they had a few Dogfish Head's, a few New Belgium selections and others.  As well as the Stone \"Enjoy By\" in bombers.  The mark-up on the bomber was pretty crazy, but it's expected at a small place like this.  It was $13.50 for a bottle of beer that costs $6.99 at the store.  That's actually more than Aces and Ales charges ($13)!  Anyhow, on to the burgers, since that's the focus here....  They have a great selection on their menu.  It was tough deciding what to have, everything sounded so good!!  I went with their signature burger - \"The Dillinger.\"  It is a 1/2 pound, never frozen, all natural beef patty topped with cheese, bacon and brisket and served with your choice of fries or asian slaw (you can get onion rings or sweet potato fries for an extra charge).  My Mom doesn't like a lot of frills, so she ordered the \"45 Special,\" which is basically just a cheeseburger, also served with fries or slaw.    The menu states that all burgers are cooked medium, unless otherwise specified.  We both got our burgers medium rare, and both were perfectly cooked!  My burger was very good and super filling.  I was so stuffed about halfway through! I was very impressed by the brisket - it was very tender and the patty was also very juicy.  To my surprise, the bacon was even crispy!  The fries were also very good.  All around I was very pleased with my dinner.  My Mom also loved her burger, although she commented it was \"nowhere near the cheesiest\" she'd ever had.  The menu talked up the burger like it would be oozing cheese, and that just isn't the case.  Either way, it was very good and she was happy.  We also ordered a side of the asian slaw to try.  It was pretty much what I expected and would be good for those who don't eat fries (although it's a burger joint?).  I wouldn't order it again, but it was tasty.  The service was good and our waitress was very friendly.  My only knock on this place is the prices.  The menu says one thing (ex: $9) and then there is a small sticker that says to add an additional amount to each burger due to the increase in the price of beef.  It ended up costing almost $50 for the 2 of us, which is kind of outrageous when you have 2 burgers, fries, a soda and a beer, along with 1 extra side.    Anyhow, I am happy to support local businesses and I will certainly be back to try other burgers (The Executioner and Baby Face Nelson come to mind)!"}
{"text":"The Dillinger is super super cool. Not quiet a dive, but it's kinda close. Sort of? It's in historic Boulder City and we stumbled upon it after walking around town hitting up antique shops. It was a great late lunch decision!!   We started with the mac & cheese bites, which holy moly are delicious and a must try!! We each got burgers...My friend got the Dillinger burger, which has not only a burger but also brisket on it. I got the Bugsy. Both burgers were messy and absolutely delicious! They're served with fries, which were also super tasty. I also had a beer, of which they have a few different options on draught.   Our server was extremely friendly, though at first I thought she was on her phone texting or something, but I guess that's just how they put orders in. A manager came by the table at some point and it looked like he made a point of stopping at each table to check in.   The decor inside is all themed around John Dillinger and it's pretty neat. It could easily pass as a dive bar, but their delicious food sets it apart! I definitely recommend stopping by while you're in Boulder City (or after a trip to the Hoover Dam)."}
{"text":"We were all famished after a trip to hoover dam. We scheduled a helicopter flight and the people there recommended dillingers. It met and exceeded our hopes. We all got a different burger and all 4 were cooked to perfection and very good. Service was good, we sat outside, and also very much enjoyed the pets allowed. The water bowls scattered around were a nice welcome to a pet friendly restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Delicious Capone Burger. They aren't lying when it says on the menu it is messy...totally worth the mess.  The sauce, the runny yolk, and juicy burger made this an amazing meal. Highly recommended. Eating outside is always a plus on great weather days like the one we had.  Service was a little slow because the place was PACKED!  Worth the wait. Mmmmmmm."}
{"text":"Food is fresh and fantastic. Little secret - try the Sticky burger with a side of fig marmalade. It's awesome!  And Stephanie is the Best!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food is super good but the service is horrible. I've been coming for years and the service has just declined tremendously. There's never the same people when I go in and the ones that have been there forever are slow rude and lazy. The management is   a whole other story. Not sure who is in charge there because it seems to be a different person all the time and no one is qualified to manage that place. The owner shows his face but doesn't like to get involved in his business so that probably is a huge reason why it's doing so poor. It really sucks because I did like this place at one point but I can't support them as a business anymore. Good luck to you if you go there...if you ever get to order and your food comes out correct and warm you'd be considered lucky."}
{"text":"First time at the Dillinger tonight! Great atmosphere, great service, great food, and great music!! Our foodie family will definitely be back for more"}
{"text":"The Yakuza burger is AMAZING.  The burger is stuffed with a crunchy Asian coleslaw and a sweet teriyaki sauce drizzle. I highly suggest pairing the burger with the fries and their house aioli sauce for $.50 more."}
{"text":"Hubby and I ordered a philly to share, with sweet potato fries and the peach bread pudding. All of it was epically good. Don't miss out on the homemade thousand island fry sauce"}
{"text":"We were in Boulder City for afternoon, I love taking a ride here, nice small quiet town well worth the drive. Someone had told us if we ever wanted a good burger to stop here at DIllinger. Me and my husband stopped in for lunch the place was very quiet and only a couple of people here. We both ordered one of their burgers with fries and my husband ordered one of their draft beers. The only person that was working was the girl behind the bar and while we were there another girl had come in I think to work, not sure. The only problem is when she was waiting on the other people she would disappear to the back, we had to wait for refills on the drinks but once she was done with whatever she had to do she came back and asked us if we needed anything. The burgers were very good and we did enjoy the food.  The prices were not that bad either. We would recommend if your looking for a place to get a drink and a bite to eat its worth trying!"}
{"text":"When leaving the Hoover Dam, we decided to look for a quick bite.   Since the town was so small, we didn't think we would find anything interesting or decent.  We found the Dillinger on Yelp!, and it seemed to fit the bill. After reading the reviews, we decided to give it a try.  The other reviews were spot on.  The service was very friendly and knowledgable. The Dillinger was exactly what we were looking for on our way back to Vegas,nothing too fancy, just a good beer and burger."}
{"text":"The Dillinger is a great bar with terrific food! Their signature Dillinger burger is possibly the best burger I've had to date! The drinks and pricing are also terrific as well. Friendly staff and fast service too!"}
{"text":"Came with friends.  2nd time , both have been great.  All the food has been the best."}
{"text":"The food was great. We had a problem and they took care of it and removed my sandwich from our bill. I never had to mention it to our waitress. I would come back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"They have the best hamburgers and on Thursday they have a wine special for $3 it's pretty good. I love the sticky burger with peanut butter. Great key lime cheese cake it goess fast. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Our visit Started OK since they said They did do Birthdays Celeb for my 9yr old son. Ordered Artichoke and was not cooked all the way. I asked Server to remove it from table. Never asked her to remove it from check. Server comes back saying that MOD said she couldn't remove from check because I ate it the wrong way. Made me extremely Angry. Told her $$$ was NOT my Problem. Made me feel like I was getting out of paying for Uncooked Appetizer. Lost my Appetite and they didn't Bother to Sing or bring Dessert to my son. So Unsatisfied with this"}
{"text":"This place had a friendly & comfortable atmosphere. It wasn't anything too fancy but was just as good or better than any decent local bar in Las Vegas. I recommend the Firehouse Chicken Sandwich! We added Avocado and a Fried Egg  it was cooked perfectly and had a spicy kick, loved it !"}
{"text":"Delicious! We needed some burgers on our trip across Nevada. They nailed it! We had The Capone (egg and bacon) and The Baby Face Nelson (fig jam and brie). They buns are toasted perfectly and meat melts in your mouth. Fast, attentive service, great covered patio."}
{"text":"Ordered the sticky burger, my friend got the Dillinger, we each cut our burgers in half and shared. While the Dillinger was pretty darn tasty after one bite of the sticky I instantly regretted giving the other half to my friend! Lol"}
{"text":"Great burger joint and they have PBR on tap.  Next time I'm in BC I'm definitely eating there again.  Sooooooo good!"}
{"text":"Great food went on a Sunday watched some football while we had a very short wait for food. Everyone ordered cheeseburgers they were amazing !! The servers were great and management came by to check on us and was very nice.  Can't wait to go back again if your in BC stop by you won't be sorry"}
{"text":"Great burgers and bread pudding.  Artichoke was ok, but i am not a fan of artichokes so don't rely on me.  Get a burger with stuff on it that you like.  Sweet potato fries are very sweet - fair warning."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate lunch there. It was very good. We both had salads, I had the steak salad and my wife had the chicken salad. They were both delicious and service was great!  We highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great burgers! Went on a busy Saturday afternoon. The service was a little slow but the food made up for it. We each had a different burger and everyone loved their meal. Will be back in the future."}
{"text":"This little burger joint is no joke.  Apparently voted one of the best in 2013, I would have to agree.  After a hot day at the Hoover Dam, the cold beer on tap was just what the doctor ordered.  The menu has several burger, sandwich and salad options, from the basic to the unique.  You have to try the sweet potato fries...sublime.  Two draft beers, two burgers and a piece of cheesescake to spilt for about $43.  The actual restaurant was quaint and the staff very friendly.  I would have given 5 stars, but any restaurant that charges extra for a little dipping sauce ticks me off just on principle.  Not a fan of nickle and diming customers....otherwise, fantastic.  If I were a local, it would be my spot."}
