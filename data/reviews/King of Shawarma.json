{"text":"For the practicing Muslims in the audience, this place serves halal meat, and is open until REALLY late (2:30-4:30am depending on the day of the week) for your estival Ramadan food fix. The portions are huge, and while not as tasty a shwarma as Chick Pea (mostly due to better veggies at CP), it gets points for availability outside daytime working hours.  They also wrap the shwarma pita in a second layer of flatbread for grill pressing, which lends a nice crispiness to the sandwich."}
{"text":"Hands down the best shawarma I've ever had. My boyfriend and I come here at least once a week. It is never hit and miss, these guys know what they are doing. They make their own garlic sauce and hummus too that you can buy and take home. I will never buy grocery store hummus again! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Didn't have high expectations as the location and restaurant are unassuming BUT it was delicious and at reasonable prices. Will return again. Had the chicken shawarma and the donair platter. That green sauce is yummy!"}
{"text":"It wasn't just the best shawarma I've ever had.   I was working late (like 4am) and checked around to see what was open. Didn't reeeeeally feel like Tim's or Subway and god forbid McDonald's (yuck). Saw these guys were open until 4:30. Brushed off my car and slid down 12 Ave to get myself some lamb.   Well, by mishap between website and real life, the staff had actually closed for the night, but they were still in there, cleaning up, etc. when I pulled up. I got out, to see their posted hours were 4 am (it was like 17 after). So, sigh, I got back in my car. I hear the squeak of the door notifier and look back to see the owner waving me back. \"Is lamb ok? We still have lamb!\" He says.   I thank him profusely for helping me out after closing, and he didn't even seem bothered about doing so. The staff were pleasant. Three more people came in after me, and they graciously served them, too.   I made a couple of little modifications: I prefer sweet sauce to garlic sauce and a bit of the hot stuff. All the toppings.   Holy shit! What a ridiculously amazing meal!"}
{"text":"Lazy and rude staff, food was tolerable but there was no onions, no tomatoes, and they didn't even bother to get more of either.  A boring attempt at making a donair, and a lacklustre job at barely bothering to put it together.."}
{"text":"This is my favourite food in the entire city. They're so friendly and they will always remember your order. They are generous with the servings and they always give you more than expected. The guys here give AMAZING service every single time. This will forever be my \"cheat\" meal.  Love, The Lobster"}
{"text":"It may be a bit of a hole in the wall, but the prices are good and the prices are great too! I found the service to be a lot better than the other reviewers seem to think, and the produce appears to be brought in fresh quite frequently!"}
{"text":"I ordered the mixed chicken and beef plater and it was awesome! My order arrived quite late but the food made up for it"}
{"text":"Just had a delicious wrap from Shawarma King.   A very tasty treat. A great wrap, with all the best of toppings - lettuce, hot peppers, parsley, pickles, cabbage, garlic sauce, hummus and a variety of other sweet and hot sauces.   The meat was perfectly cooked - moist and tender - with lots of flavor.   The service was also great, fast, friendly and attentive. A great little spot on the SW edge of downtown Calgary.   Try it you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Who likes a shawarma? I like a shawarma, you like a shawarma. Come to think of it, everyone likes a shawarma! And you can bet your lucky shawarma that's exactly what you'll find at King of Shawarma (not to be confused with \"Shawarma King\"), a darn good shawarma.  What made this shawarma a slight step above the majority of shawarma huts (not to be confused with \"The Shawarma Hut\")? Was it a late night altered state of mind? Nope, well, yes, but in this particular situation it is the amount and quality of meat you'll find in your shawarma. With King of Shawarma thee at amount and quality are \"a lot\" and \"good\".  The room is what you'd expect at any Calgary shawarma station (not to be confused with \"The Shawarma Station\"), a few food court style tables, fluorescent lighting, moderate cleanliness and a counter to order your shawarma and a few other ready to go Mediterranean treats.  Shawarma count: 16. 17 including the \"shawarma\" in my \"shawarma count\". ...19."}
{"text":"got a chicken/beef platter meal. and holy god. i have had a looooooooot of shawarmas in my day, and these guys are near in the top 3 of the hundreds i've tried. the food (I ordered) was perfect when it arived, even the house salad was fresh, crunchy, flavorful, and hada good bite to it. the suicide sauce is no joke, its really hot but also very delicious. the hummus reminds me of the stuff i had in the middle east, and really there's just nothing bad to say about this place. i dont think i'll go anywhere else again. i'm done looking after 6 years in canada and many before that in the US, i've finally found a real shawarma place."}
{"text":"Shwarma was nothing special.   The beef and lamb was pitiful,  full of large knobs of chewy rubbery grisle.  Ive had better horsemeat shawarma.  Falafels are made 2 days on advance.  Ingredients look good but tomatoe definitly is a little old.  If u cant walk 5 blocks to sammys you are too fat ,  get some excercise and stop eating shwarmas...  If you cant drive to jimmys,  get a job you bum and stop being a leech on society,  and buy a junk car for 500$..."}
{"text":"A cab driver took us here and we Have become addicted. Agreed that the place is off the beaten track, and doesn't look appealing. But the food is tasty, they serve huge portions and their homemade green hot sauce is amazing!   I Go back at least once a month ... Oh and it's open until 4:30am!!!!"}
{"text":"Liked it. Friendly staff, good food, portions are appropriate for the price. Not the fanciest place for sure but definitively the best shawarma around Downtown/Beltline."}
{"text":"Located away from the beaten track, so it's easy to miss with the one way street 12th Ave but if you're flying down 14th St. at 60km, you can forget about it, before you know it, you're over the ramp and got to take the City Centre exit, but I digress.  Nice corner location, with lots of seating, with the right side being a bit more discrete on a raised platform.  It's got a full selection of Mediterranean and even Indian desserts that I haven't had for a long time, carrot halwa, a type of pudding.  Even butter chicken :)  Shish Kabobs are pretty good value, 2 skewers and generous amount of hommus, rice, house salad and potatoes.  credit cards ok.  Offer catering.  Clean, friendly service, and cool that it's open late til 2am."}
{"text":"So my girlfriend and I worked 3 incredibly long days up in the mountains. No cell phone service, no restaurant, no grocery stores, no nothing. Isolated from humanity. Came home exhausted, tired and hungry for some warm delicious comfort food. After a quick search for restaurants near home, we decided to order from the KING of Shawarma. Reviews seemed decent. 5 stars on FB and 4 stars on YELP. Figured, why not I'm new to Calgary and need to find some good shawarma and Mediterranean food.   I order through Skip the Dishes.   Food came fast. Took about 45 minutes. I specially requested for all sauces and dips to be on the side, since I've worked in the restaurant industry before I understand that food doesn't always travel well and in order to avoid soggy messy food made my request and even apologize for the inconvenience in advance.    Food comes. I look at it and instantly become irritated. Everything is mixed together. And all the exact same shade of grey and brown. The skin was falling off the potatoes (and not in a good tasty way) the chicken was dry and flavourless. I can honestly say that neither mine or my roommates food was touched. Literally made me sick to my stomach looking at it.   Whatever, ok things happen. I get it.   I called the restaurant to complain about my order and to request either a refund or a new meal.   I asked to speak to a manger, the person on the other line said he was and that he remembered packing my food. I told him it wasn't what I ordered, and that I wasn't happy. He was rude, arrogant and refused to take responsibility for the situation. He tried to blame skip the dishes for his poor work ethic. After about 3 minutes of talking to his fine outstanding young man it comes to my attention that he is in fact NOT a manger and that none are there to talk to me or deal with the situation. After all that talking, this person can't do a thing to help me. I tell him to talk to his manager and to call ME back. He agrees.   Fast forward 30 minutes still no call. Nothing. So I call back.   First call phone rings about 15 times then disconnects.   Second call straight to voicemail.   Third call he answers. Tells me the manger isn't there. I tell him I'll be by tomorrow to return this food. He shrugs off my concerns and lets me go.   Well today, as much as I wanted to bring the food back and collect a refund, life got in the way and I needed to work. Still have yet to hear from a manager.   I didn't even receive an apology or nothing. Wound up making freezer pizza for dinner, after only wanting  shawarma from the king."}
{"text":"We came here after an hour of intense swimming/almost drowning so needless to say we were famished. I wasn't expecting much TBH since we started off trying to order one of their meat combos but were told that only the beef was ready. Also, they had some weird toppings for their wraps (like pickles) and they also wrapped the pita in a tortilla. However, despite our misgivings we were all pleasantly surprised! The serving sizes are enormous and the prices weren't unreasonable! The multiple layer wrap involving both tortilla and pita was also pretty good because the tortilla made a nice crispy layer and also held the whole thing together! The spicy sauces were especially good - get the green sauce and the red one, I have no idea what they are but they're so tasty. Their potatoes were probably the worst part of the meal since they were super coarsely cut (like one piece was basically one potato) and that meant they weren't very flavourful nor were they very crispy. Overall it's nice to know that if I want falafel I only have to walk a few blocks to King of Shawarma!"}
{"text":"I was here to pick up an order for a friend and was treated poorly.  There was one girl ahead of me and the guy working there was really focused on her, smiling, chatting and really engaging her.  When it came to me, he spoke 2 words \"pick up?\" and then walked away, chatted with the girl and came back and plopped a bag on the counter.  I asked him if this was my order (since I don't like to assume).  He said 'yes' in such a tone that led me to believe I was being annoying.  I walked out and I don't think I'll ever try this place out for myself after this dismal display of customer service."}
{"text":"My absolute favourite donair spot in the city. The flavour is different from the other Middle Eastern places. Being Afghani,  it's a bit spicier and the sauces are different. You have to try the mint sauce. It's all delicious."}
{"text":"Best shawarma, hands down! The staff are great, they know our orders by heart because we come here so much. Authentic and delicious!"}
