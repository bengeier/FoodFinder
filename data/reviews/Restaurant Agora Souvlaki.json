{"text":"has recently changed hands and the new owners will not honor the coupons the old owners sold.  Despite the far from warm service in the past, the quality and quantity of the food justified being a regular customer, since the take over the quality and quantity has diminished and we no longer frequent this establishment."}

{"text":"Ok I admit, I am very picky when it comes to good Greek food: growing up in Montreal where there are so many choices has jaded me.  Agora is a great small restaurant in western NDG: the food is OK, but not fabulous.  The service on the other hand is atrocious - when my guest asked what was in certain dishes, the waiter responded something along the lines of \"try it, you'll like it\".  Not the answer we were looking for, even after asking twice in two different ways, in two different languages.  We twice tried to get a waiter/tress to order more drink, but none were able to be located.  The food took longer than it should, and when we received the bill it is was considerably more than what the equivalent would have cost at let's say Arahova or Marathon.  One important thing to note: they do not accept credit cards!  Something that caught us off guard after ordering 2 bottles of wine, and food for 7 people.  Thankfully there are two banks on the corner near by, but realistically who does that in this day and age????  I pass by on my way to/from work every day, and often think I can make it better and cheaper at home.  Food: OK, passable Service: Minimal at best, could use a smile when greeting customers Not accepting credit cards: Priceless!"}
