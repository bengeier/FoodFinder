{"text":"Took us a while to try this, but once we did, we never looked back!

Chicken: The chicken is incredible! Flavourful and spiced nicely. 

Fries: Basic shoestring cut fries, but good. They have sort of a cajun spice they will add to your fries as well and I highly recommend it!

Coleslaw: got it once, wasn't great, but if you really need coleslaw, go for it.

Onion rings: pretty good rings, but the chicken is the star of this show.

Philly steak: I've seen really good reviews for it, but my boyfriend got it and said it was just ok. So I'm holding my opinion of it until I actually try it myself."}
{"text":"great philly steak, i haven't tried anything else yet here.. so far its really yummy sandwich.."}
{"text":"My kids like the steak on fries and the Philly steak sandwich. I like it too.

The place is rundown and not very clean, but I would still go there. Its hard for small businesses to furnish like Fast Food Franchises. I'm ok with that."}
{"text":"Been here twice, first time was quite good, second time dried out and bad.  Luck of the draw whether you get fresh chicken or old.  Price is really cheap so maybe worth a gamble."}
{"text":"This place has been here for a while , the owner is really kind and provides good service. One of the best places for cheese steaks in the gta. Menu is fully halaal"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Like all of it. always fresh and best ingredients. I always order on the phone and pick up in 10 minutes. my friends and family members are a fan of this place. my favorite is the fish sandwich and hot chicken fries. keep it up!"}
{"text":"I had passed by this place a million times and was always curious.  A few weekends ago I finally gave into curiosity.  Meh!

What is about the chicken joints in this part of the city NOT being able to give you what is on the menu when you order the combo?  Or being able to clearly communicate in English why you are not getting what is being advertised?  Worst yet, they charge the full price and do not offer anything extra.  

Fries were frozen (to be expected) and the chicken was sitting under a lamp.  Tasty but very far from the best fried chicken I've had.  No biscuit/bread.

The worst part was that it was all served on a single paper plate.  The grease soaked through and I was essentially eating off of the plastic tray.

Really can't recommend this one.  I suspect it survives from teens coming here after school or maybe a lunch crowd.  If you absolutely need to settle a fried chicken craving, live nearby and only order the chicken then I suppose it OK.  Otherwise you are better off skipping this joint."}
{"text":"So good!!!!! Definitely my favourite spot now. And my go to for junk food. I'm glad us Muslims finally have these spots to go to and eat guilt free because the meat is halal."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The steak fries is no joke the best thing I ever had in my life. Don't look like it but once you have a bite the flavors just explode in your mouth. Just absolutely amazing. The Philly is one other best in GTA and I have tried around."}
{"text":"Great find! Amazing chicken! When in this area its a must try or special trip for sure. Will repeat!"}
{"text":"This place is my favourite fast food restaurant! Their steak on fries are what I crave and it's my go-to. Spiced fries topped with a steak stir-fry smothered with cheese. It's one of their most popular dishes. And the prices here are at such a good value."}
{"text":"Came here with my husband on a Monday evening around 7pm. When we arrived another couple were finishing up, so by the time we received our order we were the only ones inside. 

The restaurant was very very dated and grimey. The floors and tables were quite dirty. It was also a hot 30 degree July day, and there was no air conditioning on so it was fairly hot and uncomfortable inside. But I've had some good meals at other hole in the wall joints so I didn't really let this affect me. 

We shared a 3 piece fried chicken combo with fries. Admittedly, the food was tasty. However, there were some huge red flags I noticed as I was eating. 

From where we were sitting, I could see the sink that was adjacent to the take out counter. The man who served us was back there with a big tray of raw chicken ripping the skin and fat off the chicken and breaking it into pieces with his bare hands. I could see him very clearly and he knew I saw him because we made brief eye contact as I was watching. When another customer came in, he went to the front counter without washing his hands then grabbed and touched the tongs, various condiments, the paper plates he served food on and the cash register. 

I was disgusted and appalled. Raw chicken is probably the most dangerous food contaminant. I would not be surprised if this establishment is unable to pass any sort of safe dining or food handling test. Will never ever go back, no matter how tasty their food was."}
{"text":"What the heck do they marinate that chicken in? it is addictive.   Super fresh fried chicken - nothing from under a heat lamp - they cook it when you order it.   So deliicious.   The taste is clearly in the meat since the chicken is super yummy after you peel the uber-crispy skin off.  

9 large pieces plus a jumbo order of fries (way more than 3 people could try to finish) - $15.   Yum.   Go there!  

Actually - go to The Only first - get your dry cider - then go to City Chicken.  Eat chicken, drink cider, listen to live music.  Life on the Danforth doesn't get much better."}
{"text":"Based on the other high reviews, I tried this place.  Chicken was \"ok\", but not fresh - was taken from some heat lamps it was sitting under.  No bread available, though it was advertised on the menu.  I don't mind eating at a dive if the food is great, but this place was just a dive, without the great food."}
{"text":"City is located right outside the Donlands station. It offers some really great fried chicken!! Made so fresh you may have to wait for your order but totally worth it! And it's a family restaurant- you may see their little girl helping out with the cash from time to time. You can't miss her, she has a beautiful smile :)

2 pc with mash and biscuits will run you about 6bucks which is really decent.

I went in for a 20 piece order this week and it got steep. $28+ tax so about $31. Was for a party and well worth it- those things must have grown wings again cause they flew out of sight in the blink of an eye!!! Their sandwiches and burgers are great too but I've never had their pizza.

I RECOMMEND- Calling in your order if you're in a super rush. 15- 20 minutes wait is typical.

EXTRA TIP- Halal chicken :)"}
{"text":"Visited all 3 locations and all 3 are amazing. I asked around about where I could find a good halal burger or philly steak and a co worker recommended me to try this place and have kept going since. The Danforth location is what I tried first but been going to the other 2 because closer to home. I will say nothing but respect given at All 3 locations especially Danforth. The young man makes you feel welcome and you can see he has pride in the food he gives out. The burger is amazing. Always juicy and on point. The Philly steak is a favourite as well and is well known as the top sandwich at this place. Although I wish they used different cheese (just my opinion I dont like it) so I order my burgers n philly without it but that speaks for itself why I still gave it a 5 star rating. Keep up the great work!"}
