{"text":"Visited 80th and Ivy 3 times. Great every time. Had Laura as a waitress tonight. She did a fantastic job. Recommended a good dish and drink. Try the Greek ribs and the buck a shuck oysters. Also even made an item for us that is not on the menu (kale chips)."}
{"text":"I had dinner here last week with a group.  The food was ok.  I had the bbq chicken flatbread, it was pretty standard.  I would give a better review but I was put off by my experience with the waitress.  I was sitting on one of the high tables with the bar stools.  She was carrying a bunch of dishes and walked behind me.  I felt something sharp digging into my back, when I looked, I noticed a knife was jabbing me.  It wasn't just a little poke, it was dragged across my shirt, she was obviously in a hurry.  It hurt! She mumbled a quick \"sorry\".  The sting of the knife lingered, but I didn't want to cause a scene with the group I was with so I ignored it.  When I got home, I noticed there was a large snag across the back of my shirt (albeit it was a thin shirt, but it was hot out) and a scratch on my back.  

Also, when our table was ready to leave, we asked the waitress to split our bill.  She was obviously not happy judging from her facial expression.  It took her about five tries to get the bills right.  Overall, not impressed, won't go back."}
{"text":"On Saturday, December 28th between approximately 6:30pm and around 8:00pm, my wife and I were dining at 80th and Ivy with another couple to celebrate an important event in our lives. As a group we ordered a couple drinks, some burgers, the prime rib and the ravioli. Quite honestly, by the end of the dinner no one in our party recalled how the food tasted and actually a couple of us simply did not eat.
After being seated, our waitress was immediately very inappropriate and overly friendly with myself in particular despite it being very clear that I was with my wife. As a matter of fact she did not even acknowledge my wife when she spoke to her, rather she only focused on me. Feeling very uneasy already, my wife and I switched chairs expecting that maybe this would resolve the unusual interaction. It did not. When the waitress came over to take our orders she proceeded to walk right behind me and \"caress\"/stroke my back from shoulder to shoulder right in front of my wife and our guests. We were absolutely horrified and shocked. What made it worse is she did not even consider her actions to be disrespectful to my wife or myself.
Despite being appalled we still ordered our food because we were intent on having a good night out and did not want to cause a scene with our friends there. As noted above, my wife did not even eat, and myself and one other guest barely finished our meals. I honestly cannot provide an assessment of the quality of food...my apologies.
It got worse, upon concluding the meal and having our plates taken away the same waitress came back and once again stroked my back and shoulders. This was not a simple light touch, this was an intentional rub of my shoulders. I moved away from her in disgust and looked at her like she must have been insane, and my wife demanded to just receive the bill. My wife asked her what her name was and the waitress replied that it was \"L****, and why?\", and raised her voice and asked \"what it was she was doing wrong?\"...strangely, if a similar action had taken place with a female guest or a similar event had occurred in an office in downtown Calgary I do not expect anyone would have been wondering, \"what it was she was doing wrong?\"
We told her what she was doing wrong, clearly offered no tip, but paid our full bill nevertheless. Upon conclusion of the transaction she looked at the receipt, which was around $140, threw it on the table and she proceeded to walk away and talk about us with her other staff members and an individual who appeared to be the manager. At this point no one else came over to discuss our concerns. We left and pleasantly enjoyed a coffee with our friends at a different establishment.
We will not be returning to this restaurant or any other establishment operated by its parent company and certainly will not be recommending it to our friends, family and coworkers."}
{"text":"I find this place consistently good. Great atmosphere for friends and pre-drinks although I would not recommend for a romantic evening. Ambiance is lively and fun - patio (if warm) is right on 17th avenue. I have not been disappointed with food - Greek ribs today were delicious. Not gourmet fare but a cut above earls, milestones, etc. Service, on my three visits, was timely and friendly."}
{"text":"Came here after realizing I had purchased a Groupon for it months ago. 
Things started out well. The server was great, even shook our hands and asked us our names. The arugula beet salad with walnuts was decently good. The mains came out in good time, and meanwhile our server was making sure we had what we needed at regular but not annoying intervals. Then we tried to eat our food. Well, I'm not sure where they get off charging $31 for the smallest steak I have ever seen. Not to mention the tendon inside of it that made it hard to cut. Unfortunately my bf couldn't eat it, also it was cooked a lot more rare than he had asked and was cold. I had the beef brisket sandwich. It came open faces with some sort of mayonnaise type of layer underneath and the most acidly tangy onions on top. Perhaps this mix would work together in harmony if it too wasn't cold. Anyhow our server told the manager who came to our table and comped us for the mains, which I appreciated seeing as we didn't eat the food. He offered dessert. I was hungry so I said yes.. It was a bread pudding, the server joked that it was really good and if we didn't like it, then we must be the problem. I told her it was good, and it was sort of, but a bit dry. The sauce was quite good and it came a la mode which could've made the cake itself hard. You know, when you read their site, you expect great things, things place talks a good talk, but disappointed in the end. Needless to say I won't go back, so I'm not sure what to do with my groupon now..."}
{"text":"this is terrible place,i went today at 1:30 took me 1hour later to service the appetizer and other haft hour for main meal but they forgot my bread i told them 2 times..... 2 staffers there and wasnt only my table complaining.really unhappy at all"}
{"text":"They got me with the tuna loin sandwich. It was cooked PERFECTLY, most places tend to over cook it and it just ruins the dish... They have a wide selection of wines for all tastes, even for me that love the soft, sweet, fruity reds. 

It can get super loud in there on weekend nights and sometimes there is a wait to get a table, but I guess that is expected at any good restaurant on 17th."}
{"text":"Went there for our Valentines dinner and I have no serious complaints. The service was excellent and our waitress Aisha was very friendly and helpful in every way. The appetizers, mushroom dip and oysters were excellent. However the main entrees I felt were just a little basic and bland. We had the lamb and arctic char. Perhaps it was just our choice. The quality was great but I guess it just felt like an ordinary dinner rather than a special night out. The dessert, sticky toffee pudding, was great and definitely recommend it as our waitress did. Overall if you want a decent dinner and a nice ambiance this is a good place, just dont expect your mind to be blown."}
{"text":"Had an excellent meal here. So delicious. 
It appears to be difficult to get into at times so a reservation is recommended. 
I would recommend the prime rib."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, but not worth the service or experience.  Experienced brunch a few months ago and service was extremely spotty and slow.  My office is near 80th and Ivy and we've yet to have a good lunch experience.  I don't think they understand not everyone has the luxury of going out for a 2 hour lunch - most of us need to get back to work, so if you offer an affordable and \"quick\" lunch option, in needs to be quick and within an hour.  Or if you can't accommodate a larger group within a reasonable timeframe, you should mention that at the start.  Friendlier service would be appreciated too.  Too many great other lunch options on 17th Ave so I think we're done trying!"}
{"text":"I Love this place, Food is good but small portions. The service is  amazing from the bartender, waiters, and chef... super friendly, I would highly recommend!
All it need is roof top patio!"}
{"text":"The last time I visited we ordered all the desserts on the menu - don't worry, there are only three - and had an indulgence fest like you wouldn't believe. We were six girls on a mission. I would recommend all the desserts but am partial to cheesecake so get ready to loosen your belt and go the gym the next day. Of course, all of this was following a delicious dinner of shared appetizers. One of my favourite things are the steak bites. Get them. 

The only thing that's not to love? The service. The wait staff are slow, have no interest in being there and have no problem elbowing customers in the back as they pass by. Tip - sit by the wall!"}
{"text":"we went there last nite for a birthday party... the server laura was probably the best I have come across in all of Calgary....... I have managed and waitressed for 30 years and dine out lots and I was totally impressed with the way she handled things , her friendliness and organizational skills are top notch....... was looking forward to the prime rib special but they ran out so go early because this is a very trendy and packed restaurant......."}
{"text":"I usually give new restaurants a bit of a grace period before reviewing them as they are typically working out kinks to get things underway. With 80th and Ivy, I didn't feel I needed to wait as my first impressions were overwhelmingly positive.  They have an excellent wine list that you don't feel like you are being raked over the coals for in terms of price and value, 20 wines by the glass and a promotion on Wednesday's where they have 30 different bottles off their list for a mere $30. They have quite an extensive cocktail list that would be a lot of fun to get to know too.

The lunch menu represents reasonable value with salads running between $12 to $16 and Sandwiches between $14 and $16.  I decided to dine off the small plates menu and tried their Japanese inspired Sirloin Bites $13 and their Duck Two Ways $14.  I particularly enjoyed the duck confit wrapped in phylo pastry served with crushed pistacios and a honey based sauce - like duck baklava!  It was an excellent foil to the Backhouse Pinot Noir they are currently offering by the glass.  The menu is loaded with lots of Alberta produced ingredients like Spring Creek Beef, Sylvan Star Cheeses and Broek Farms Pork.

Service is prompt and attentive - the lounge has a nice feel to it, living room styled with some amazing aluminum bar chairs. The dining room is intimate with the kitchen exposed allowing guests to see their food being prepared....a nice concept that we really liked. If these guys can keep their execution and service levels as high as delivered on my first visit, they will be in business for a long time."}
{"text":"I usually sit at the bar when I come here, the bartenders always give good service and they make great specialty cocktails! I ordered some beef bites and they were incredible! Had to order seconds!"}
{"text":"This place has had mixed reviews so I wasn't expecting much when I arrived here for lunch with some girlfriends.

Just as I sat down, our server came over and reached out her hand to intro herself (ok weird!) and handed me a menu. We ordered the gorgonzola mushroom dip and the pan seared shrimps and scallops to start, I ordered the homemade fettuccine, and the other girls went with  the braised short ribs sandwich, classic Alberta burger and soup & salad (the daily soup was minestrone and she went with the west coast salad).

The dip came out first, and it was really good - it had a thicken mushroom soup/risotto texture to it. The scallops and shrimps were tiny, the bacon and plum relish it came with was tasty.

We had all ordered drinks at the beginning (two of us had water, one had wine and the other the Ivy Lemonade) and besides the wine the rest of us were waiting for our drinks and had to ask the waitress again AFTER we had finished our appetizers. She managed to bring out our waters and then buggered off (still no lemonade). 

Our food came out and looked good, and besides the burger that's as far as the goodness went. My pasta noodles were mushy, and completely lacked flavor. I tried adding a bit of salt and pepper to liven it up and nothing. The short rib sandwich had a hearty heap of meat - but it was also bland. After having to ask for a spoon for her soup (seriously?) my girlfriend said her minestrone soup tasted like it came from a can - after a few bites she didn't even bothering eating it.

I rendered my pasta inedible and when the server finally came by with my friend's lemonade, I asked her to take my pasta back. She asked if I'd like anything in replacement and since I figured I couldn't go wrong with salad so I ordered the beet & arugula one. It came out quickly and was surprisingly good.

Our server split out our bill for us including the appetizers (always appreciated), but she forgot to honor the $3 off wine glass pours for my friend. Considering the shotty service we'd been getting, we just settled the bill and left.

I honestly think your money is best spent elsewhere - food and service are completely lackluster, I know I won't be back."}
{"text":"Went here on a first date on a Sunday afternoon. Really nice service, attentive without being clingy (I'm talking about the server, although the date was as well).

They gave us some banana bread to start which was tasty. They also had a boozy sample table happening so we got a little drink and a free promo watch. Interesting.

I had a burger - it was well constructed, tasty with really good toppings on it. Their fries are also great. If I'm going to have fries they should be awesome and they delivered on that.

My date had the chicken club and it looked good. We also had the crumble for dessert. It was really good and a nice way to end the meal.

We had wine - I didn't order it but my date said the selection was decent.

I saw a lot of items on the menu that captured my attention so I will for sure check it out again!"}
{"text":"Service is extremely slow
waitress has no people skills or communications, neither does the manager
Food is dis**sting, it never use to be like this.
If you want good food and service go to Cibo"}
{"text":"It's a really nice looking restaurant with a great patio. If you're a vegetarian, I would not recommend it. I ended up having some bread and a side dish of potatoes for dinner. Even the daily soup had meat."}
{"text":"I was with with my husband a few weeks ago and let me tell you.... to start with, Hotel Arts made reservations on our behalf as we were celebrating our wedding anniversary. We get to the restaurant and are greeted by the host and wished us happy anniversary, took us to our table and right after, our server came to introduce herself, wished us happy anniversary too and gave us some bubbly... that was really nice of them, the food was really good, we had shrimp, steak with mac n cheese, cocktails. Every dish was very well seasoned and well cooked.

The place has a very nice ambiance to it, loved it, we both were very impressed!

Oh, and during dinner,  the manager also came to say happy anniversary. Everyone there really made it very special. Thank you to all of them!
Definitely going back for the food AND the service."}
{"text":"The sign looks like 'GOTH & Ivy' to passerby on 17th at first glance.  I digress..

Another très trendy hot spot along 17th Ave, so I just had to check this place out for myself. A friend and I decided to stop in for drinks and appetizers to start off our evening. We were seated quickly and greeted by our friendly server who introduced herself and asked our names. Nice touch btw.

I ordered a raspberry cosmo-tini (shaken, not stirred) that was so delicious & refreshing that I had to order another. We shared the meat & cheese board along with the margherita pizza.. Both were average.  

The atmosphere at 80th is contemporary & somewhat pretentious. Beautiful people sipping sangria on the patio, swanky decor & open kitchen design makes for a place that spells 'POSH' with a capital P! 

I may or may not return to 80th in the future, but I must admit that this isn't really my scene.. It's also VERY loud inside the restaurant (what's up with the low ceilings in here??) and the music is cranked up full-volume. It's very difficult to enjoy a conversation with someone seated a mere 2 feet away. 

All gloss and very little substance..."}
{"text":"Good for drinks,but not much else. Even that is debatable. We went last night and the place was very busy. Fun crowd. However, the service was slow, the martinis were warm and the food was very average, most of it was cold. Many better restaurants in the city to choose from. Brian."}
{"text":"My first impressions of this restaurant was fantastic, we had to call ahead to say that we will be showing up late for our reservation on a Saturday evening and they were very nice to us saying not to worry. 

Upon arrival I found the hostess to be super friendly and sweet, our server came by right away to take our drink order and talk to us about the specials but then she disappeared for long periods of time throughout our meal.

We ordered the Medjool stuffed chorizo dates wrapped in bacon to start and were served the in house made focaccia. The dates might be the best I have eaten to date; the bread was good but quite dense. For my main dish I had the Cajun chicken sandwich and although it has wonderful flavour it was dripping with mayo and it kind of ruined it for me. 
As it got a little later in the night I noticed that it started to get really, really loud we couldn't even hear each other from across our small table which made us call it a night."}
{"text":"We went here last night for our anniversary dinner and we were very impressed!  

I booked a reservation online early that morning for 8:45 pm, which was the soonest we could get in.  We ended up being about 15 minutes early and were able to get seated right away up in the kitchen area in a perfect corner booth.  We had a great view of the entire place.  

I loved the decor and as I was seated I thought to myself that I could see myself going there more often based on that alone.  

The staff was great.  Quick.  They had menus, water and free prosecco(on account of our anniversary) to us moments after being seated.  The prosecco was delicious and a prefect start to our wonderful dinning experience.  

Hubby ordered a burger and herbed frites(fancy word for french fries) and we split a sharing order of Mac n Cheese(was so yummy!).  I got a greek salad, which was huge and practically a meal in itself, and the Gorgonzola mushroom dip.  It was all so delicious.  I ended up having to share my mushroom dip with hubby, because I was so full from the salad and mac n cheese.  Despite being full we keep eating because the taste was incredible!  

Even though, we were so stuffed we still ordered a dessert.  We split the chocolate mousse with raspberry compote.  Also... was very tasty!  I probably could have forced down and entire dish despite being so full.  

My only teeny tiny issue was they were not very attentive to keeping the water refreshed, but the delectable food and otherwise great service(the staff was so chatty, friendly and they kept checking on how our food was) out weighed that by far and I'm giving them 5 stars.  We will be back... again and again!"}
{"text":"80th and Ivy is a new restaurant in town, and they know what they are doing. I checked out the place this weekend and had a very, very positive experience.

From the moment I walked in, Jamie, the bar manager introduced himself to me and was really friendly. The restaurant was empty, but the patio was full. It was windy outside, so we sat inside. The decor is fresh, simple and modern. Very cool place to get together with some friends or an informal date. The menu is interesting and varied. Our table of 4 ordered a bunch of different things to share: the arugula salad, the rotisserie chicken sliders, margherita flatbread, tuna and watermelon salad and herbed frites. All the dishes were good, and well-presented. By the end of the meal, we were all satisfied, and not overly-stuffed. 

We also ordered some cosmos and some glasses of Moscato D'Asti. The drinks were very, very good. The cosmos were different from ones I've had at other places. More fresh, fruity and refreshing. And the Moscato was AMAZING. Absolutely PERFECT summer wine. 

The main standout of 80th and Ivy, however, was the service. Our waitress Chelsea was friendly, warm and gave the right amount of space. She seemed genuinely interested in providing us with nice, attentive service. Jamie kept to check up on us again while we were eating. My friends thought I must have known Jamie from before, seeing as to how attentive him and his staff were to us. But no, this was my first time there, and we truly felt like valued patrons. This is a rare occurrence in this city. Well, in any city for that matter.

I would return to 80th and Ivy in a heartbeat. Fabulous atmosphere, excellent service and great drinks - 80th and Ivy is off to a superb start!"}
{"text":"A large group of us went to 80th and Ivy for dinner and drinks. The food was FANTASTIC! I am in LOVE with the steak bites - so tender and tasty!! The pear and gorgonzola flatbread was also addictive. We also shared shrimp, mushroom dip and sliders. Everything was good, but the steak bites, yeah, they're amazing. 

Drinks (tried an Old Fashioned and a Caiparihna) were really strong, but that shouldn't be a complaint right?"}
{"text":"This is the first review of a restaurant I've ever given, I'm generally not the complaining type but I was so disappointed with brunch today. I met at 1:00 with two girlfriends and were enthusiastically taken care of by Andrew (?) for the first few minutes, he brought us drinks (flirted a little maybe) and was friendly. After telling us he was going on a break things got bad. 

Our new waitress took our order and after over 30 minutes (there were only TWO other occupied tables in the entire place) our food came out - wrong and cold. They screwed up both orders of eggs benedict and the hollandaise sauce was cold...appetizing. After finishing our meals it took another 30 minutes from that point to when the manager (?) came over to wipe the table and we asked for the bill, it never came. 

After 15 more minutes or so he stopped by again and asked us if we wanted any dessert or shots, SHOTS?! It was 2:30 on a Sunday, plus we already asked for the bill. No thank you I don't want any tequila right now. We reiterated we wanted the cheque again. 15 more minutes go by and the expressionless waitress comes by to refill our waters and we had to ask again for the bill. Finally she brought it over. My bill was $25 and I gave her a $50 bill, I watched her struggle for 3 minutes to count out change. 

Obviously we did not leave a tip for service, which was far below acceptable. The food was \"meh\" anyway. I'm disappointed since I had been living in Mt Royal for almost two years and always passed this place so I was excited to try it, I will not be back. Listen to your customers and speed up your service please."}
{"text":"I've been searching for a good brunch place since I moved to Calgary last winter and I've finally found a great go-to place! The Sunday breakfast buffet is $20 and includes your coffee. If you check in on Facebook, you save an additional $5!   Brunch for $15 (especially of this calibre) is unheard of!  Great food, great service and a great atmosphere. Can't wait to go back."}

**********************************************************************************

It was 8pm on a Saturday night and the restaurant wasn't as busy as I thought it would be. It is fairly spacious with an outdoor patio; a casual lounge-like area with bar stools at the front; and a back area for more \"formal\" dining. For anyone who appreciates open kitchens, I recommend sitting in the back area. I very much liked the modern decor, but you will find it a bit disjointed with light undertones at the front and a darker, homey feel in the back. 

I was the last to arrive at my table and once I sat down I was greeted almost immediately by the server. The service wasn't outstanding; our server left us hanging for half the night and we had to remind her twice about moving us to the patio when a table freed up.

I was expecting to order tapas when I arrived at 80th and Ivy, but I was surprised to see that they changed their concept. There was nothing unique or memorable about their menu; it felt like a copycat of other \"farm to table\" concept restaurants.

Pricing is fairly reasonable with rotisserie items under $30 (changing daily); and gourmet hamburgers and sandwiches for around $15-$20. Drinks on the other hand were slightly above average with a pint of beer ~$8. My group and I ordered a few items to share:

- Mac and Cheese sharing plate ($8): For the price, you get a very large portion but it was bland, the noodles were mushy, and the dish wasn't very hot. I was expecting a rich, creamy, saucy dish, instead it was like eating a cheesey noodle casserole. Would not recommend.

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/80th-and-ivy-calgary-2?select=3PB2kBhPLWpqWuiDUcO4PQ#3PB2kBhPLWpqWuiDUcO4PQ

- Chef's Selection Meat and Cheese Board ($15): Great to share, but lacked variety. The board contained a delicious sausage, salami, parmesean, some sort of brie blue cheese, another white cheese, olives, grainy mustard, pickled onions, and crostinis. I disliked how the waitress didn't explain what the components were. If you are a charcuterie connoisseur, I do not recommend this dish.

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/80th-and-ivy-calgary-2?select=3PB2kBhPLWpqWuiDUcO4PQ#4X3326veG-slSQsyYBnXaA

- Corleone Pizza ($16) with chorizo, prosciutto, wild mushrooms, arugula, chili oil: The pizza was one of the better dishes we had. The thin crust was crispy, it was full of cheese and the flavours were enjoyable.

All in all, 80th and Ivy is not on the top of my list of restaurants to recommend or go to. The food lacked creativity, the service didn't impress me, and I found the restaurant lacking in its own identify."}
{"text":"I went here again for a friend's birthday and felt it was warranted to write another review. 

I'm probably being too generous in giving them a 3 star, but the food was amazing. We went Saturday and had a reso, although it wasn't that busy when we got here. They stuff us in a high table, right next to a huge group and you could barely move your chair. So that was super annoying to get bumped all night by the servers and people at the table coming and going. 

Our server was, well I can't say anything nice, so I won't say anything at all. Seriously, they hire the worst serving staff. She spent most of the night gossipping with her friends that were at another table, instead of doing her job. We weren't in a rush or I would have said something. 

Due to my last experience I was super picky on ordering. The wifey and I shared the Butcher's board (as I know that is gluten free), and wow. I've never had rib eye, or steak for that matter be this delicious. It was perfect. There was also lamb and chicken, which was really good. For the sides we went brocolini and frites. Which were ok, nothing too special. 

Champagne was good as always, I'd be worried if they screwed that up. It's a tough decision if I would come here again. This time the food was great, but every time the service sucks. For the price and type of place I think I'll go to Candela."}
{"text":"Some friends and I went here for Story Slam. I don't have much good to say about the restaurant - Story slam was fun.  I had a broken chair and I was uncomfortable the whole night. The place was pretty full and I didn't have an option to another chair. The server was inattentive, no water refills and half the table received their food 30 minutes after the first half. I didn't like eating my food in front of my friends who didn't get their food.  The server didn't seem to think this was a problem even though we complained.  The curry chickpea soup was so thick, more of a stew and very spicy which the server didn't mention.  The burgers were on the small side and very spicy which was not mentioned in the menu. Fries were not salted and no salt on the tables, server was no where to be seen after we received our food.  Overall disappointing. Doesn't call me back."}
{"text":"Had an awesome live band but was too loud to have a conversation around

really cool look to the place ! 

Great food but was not the high quality that was expected for the price."}
{"text":"Planning to eat dinner on 17th Ave without making a reservation is a prime example of a FOOL'S ERRAND, exactly the sort of shenanigans ol Ange' get's himself into when procrastination gets the best of him. Fortunately despite a busy night, 80th was able to take a couple of weathered hungry winter street walkers in and accommodate their hunger pangs with dinner and drinks. Our waitress was lovely enough to let us know that if we wanted our food we would have to order right away because the restaurant was entertaining a massive birthday dinner party who has yet to put their orders through. We ordered their Chipotle Chicken Wraps, Arugula salad, and their Bhami Goren noodle bowl. The chicken wraps were tasty and was a difficult thing to share, so I had to be a gentleman and let the lady have 2/3 of the dish. But I had the Bhami all to myself. Strips of pork, bacon on noodles with a siracha based hot sauce? An amazing alternative to the pad thai I was craving for earlier in the day.

For dessert we had their sticky toffee. it was ok, but the gelato that accompanied it was balls out delish. Probably outsourced but who cares?

Great atmosphere, I'm def coming back here with some friends."}
{"text":"we went for valentine dinner. it was super busy and had live band. server was good. atmosphere was good too. food was great. we had 1/2 roisstier chicken and chicken ciabatta sandwich were both delicious. however dissappointed at the appetizer and dessert.. had only two options for dessert and wasnt good at all."}
{"text":"I had a great little pre-movie snack at 80th & Ivy (not Goth & Ivy as I initially thought it was called) last weekend.  Their tapas and share plates are delish - I had the Duck 2 Ways and Stuffed Dates.  Yum!  I highly recommend :)

My only comments for improvement - with the floor-to-ceiling windows at the front of the restaurant, it is a little chilly when you're sitting in that section.  But otherwise great atmosphere and music - the staff were all wonderful and very friendly."}
{"text":"One star for service, Laura was awesome.  The chefs never tasted the food entire 2 hours I watched them..  Lamb was fatty and still pink.  Lacked flavor and stringy chewy fat inside pieces of meat like a cheap cut of blade steak.  You can use cheap cuts, but they need proper cooking.... Large Israeli coscou s was only saving grace.  Big balls in Israel.   The frizee was totes picked way to early.  The asparagus had a poison taste like a bad plum, one bite and you will spit it out.   The desert chocolate pate  tasted a little less deep as a chocolate orange but a lot richer and lighter.

Manager disagreed with everything, and pointed to some boisterous men pounding beers and said \"they loved the lamb\"...I'm sure most drunks would love to eat raw white fat.   Told me he tasted the asparagus and its just a sharp flavour, wow, hes delusional and kidding himself.  He must eat those spoiled plums with the worst poison taste you can imagine and think they are just sharp.... 

I however cringe when i see white uncooked fat.  He continued to make excuses saying that the rotissery blah blah etc etc.  Even if you rotisserie the meat you still need to cut the fat off when you are finished to give a good piece of meat.  Undercooked Lamb thats mostly gristle and sinue in the meat."}
{"text":"I had dinner on a Wednesday night with my boyfriend. We purchased a livingsocial coupon a while ago, so we thought we would give this place a try.

The restaurant itself looks very nice, although I am not a fan of the high chairs and tables near the entrance area. The tables in the back of the restaurant near the kitchen looks much more comfortable, but when I asked if we could be moved they said that reservations had been made and they could not move us (but we also had reservations..).

We started with two appetizers, the gorgonzola mushroom dip and the duck two ways. It took a while for the food to come out, and we noticed that a table next to us who sat down later than us and ordered later than us got their dip first... Our dip came out about 10 minutes after their's. The dip was delicious though! The portion is huge, I think it could be shared between 4 people. Our second appetizer came out after we finished our dip.. What was up with that? At this point we started thinking the kitchen must be unorganized, because the place wasn't busy at all. The duck two ways was ok.. We didn't think it was anything amazing and thought it was pricey.

For our mains we ordered the lobster they had on special with a side of soup and a fettuccine. I think this is where everything went downhill. The lobster was great (but I think it'd be very difficult to mess up lobster) but our soup was SO SALTY! We even poured water in it to see if it would make it bearable but nope. Also, my pasta was so overcooked! How can they mess up something so easy like pasta? It was literally mush because it had been cooked too long, and it tasted like nothing, super bland. I can't decide which was the worst food I've ever had in a restaurant, the soup or the pasta.

The only highlight of our entire mess of a night was our waitress, she was very friendly and did not even hesitate a moment to take our food back when we let her know and she brought us a new entrée and salad to make up for the horrible pasta and soup. She also offered to buy us dessert, but we just weren't up for it so we kindly declined her offer.

Our bill came to a total of $65, with the pasta and the soup taken off the bill... Our coupon was for $50 but we still had to pay the remainder and tip the waitress because we couldn't really blame her for the horrible food. 

Either way, I don't think we will be back.. I only gave the place 2 stars because the dip was so good and the service was amazing. I'd be scared to try anything else on the menu after last night's experience."}
{"text":"Had dinner on a Saturday night with some friends and I did not have a good experience at all. Every time the wait staff would come to the table I felt very rushed. We had looked at the menu ahead of time and decided we would have their special for the night and we were told that they were out of it. Not having enough of their signature dish on a prime dining night I was not impressed. When I did finally decide what to have I was not impressed. Vegetables on the plate some were overlooked and mushy and others were under cooked. The best part of the night was the desert. I may return to give it a second chance but first impressions were not good at all."}
{"text":"Tonight me and my childhood girlfriend chose to spend my birthday dinner at 80th & Ivy.  That was a mistake..,

We sat on patio and were served by Meghan - we ordered a pitcher of sangria for 25.00 as the per glass price was 6.00.  The mini pitcher that was presented - well it filled both out glasses and was empty - the lady beside us ordered a glass and came just as full. These people have been making double the money selling a pitcher - you get it - I asked the server what was going on and she said that was just what they serve - however had other tables complaining about the same thing and felt bad. 

We ordered the bacon covered dates, steak bites, chicken flatbread and parm fries - oh and the chowder ( which was gross and minced up like oatmeal ) yuck 

The fries were mushy and half cooked - the chicken in the flatbread was dry and stringy - it was just gross. We ate the steak bites out of hunger - however there was literally 3oz of meat for what 16.00 bucks ? And it was these tiny crap pieces - 

I approached the manager, whom I might add, dumps food on the table as she serves it doesn't smile  and looks stressed out with all of the 7 tables on the patio (inside had one single man in the entire place )brightly unprofessional - enough said this isn't about her really - 

I explained the above to her - she attempted to bullshit me that the pitcher had more liquor than a glass - and why they charged 2x plus the price - well yes it would have more volume - but per ounce the liquor has to be the same - it's the law - I didn't bother explaining that to her - how she has that role is beyond me - 

She didn't care - in fact she barely said a word - I told her I wasn't
 paying for any of this - as I didn't drink the sang aria or eat the food - she brought me the bill anyway and said I drank some and ate some so I clearly likes it - she has no idea how to handle This situation- I gave up - I payed and left - 

I will not go back and it's pretty telling the entire place was nearly empty at dinner rush - I wouldn't recommend it - it's also with 1410 and Roosevelt - both with crap service and food - i would recommend avoiding any of this group locations-"}
{"text":"I heard about this place from a friend, and ducked in one afternoon for lunch when I was in the area.  I sat in the warm, open, lovely back room and had a modest lunch: a delicious rotisserie chicken sandwich (with a not-too-sweet BBQish sauce), and a fabulous kale salad.  The kale was not the huge tough kale you find in supermarkets, but colorful (some rosy pink and bright purple in there!) and pretty tender.  It was dressed with some lemon, bread crumbs, and sharp nutty cheese shavings.  On the wall/chalkboard were local farms' names where they source some ingredients.  Two guys in funky bandanas were slicing meats behind the counter and preparing for that night's dinner, it seemed.

It was a slow afternoon, and the staff was exceedingly friendly.  Not just my waitress, but a smiley guy setting up chairs and napkins came by to say hi (It was very nice to meet you too, Carlos) and ask if it was my first time, where I was from, etc. etc.

Great little spot, I'd happily return - especially at night, when I can imbibe - next time I'm visiting Calgary!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with a co-worker today and was pleasantly surprised. When we arrived and we were the only ones there at 11:45 I was worried but the meal was good. 

Since the burgers were the special ($10 for either of the burgers on the menu) we both went with a burger (one of each). I had the 80th and Ivy burger that had pears and cambozola cheese and was thrilled when it arrived. There was lots of cheese on a burger that was NOT overcooked (something that I find happens more often than not in Calgary) and it was delicious! My friend really enjoyed hers as well and we were both pleasantly surprised but the huge amount of bacon on hers.  

I didn't give this place five stars for one reason. When we sat down the waitress came over and introduced herself to us, she asked our names and shook our hands. It was awkward and uncomfortable and one of the weakest handshakes I have ever had. I don't blame the server because she probably does it 100 times a day and so she doesn't shake hands like she means it. I think (and clearly a lot of other reviewers agree) that they should stop this practice."}
{"text":"Really nice service and tasty food, I recommend the lobster, it is very yummy"}
{"text":"We came here for drinks after Local - this place was nice in terms of really quick service and seating. We got prime seating on the area where the restaurant overlooks the patio area. I liked how quick and efficient the waitress was - but the crowd overall was kind of eh. I would give this place another try if we were in the area though as the restaurant portion and staff were friendly and nice."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice and both times they have been extremely disapointing seeing how it is a rather new restaurant and a lot of people are talking about it. The ambiance and decor of the place is great, but the food is below average and the service is pretty bad.

Both times I went the waiters were not very friendly at all. I ordered the french toast the first time around and it was frozen in the middle. 

The second time I went was for a birthday brunch which I had made a reso for about a week prior. When we arrived there was nobody there to greet us at the door, instead a random guy got up from eating his meal at the bar and asked if we needed a table - didn't seem to have any clue about my reso. We all ordered breakfast and they ended up screwing up almost all of our orders. My one friend ordered the yogurt parfait and the yogurt tasted like it had gone bad. The rest of our meals were pretty cold and not the greatest quality. Because of the mixup with the orders they ended up giving us a discount on drinks - but when the bills came half of us got the discount, half of us didn't. 

Overall both times I have gone have not been a good experience. For a newer high end restaurant I don't think it lives up to the talk, and it doesn't deserve a prime spot on 17th ave. You could go to another restaurant and get a lot better service and food!"}
{"text":"Great spot for date night, or dinner with friends. I'm really disappointed to hear that this place closed, especially without us getting to go one last time."}
{"text":"We work nearby and have come here a few times. Every time it's slow, and it takes about 1.5 hours to get in and out. While the food and lunch special are good, I'm shocked at how every time someone's order is forgotten or arrives when everyone else is wrapping up. Great for dinner, but would avoid going for lunch here if you expect timely service."}
{"text":"This is modern, brightly lit and energetic branch of the same group that operates 1410 and Roosevelt in 17 Ave.
The service has always been good and the servers are courteous and professional, the food and beer are excellent and the price is in line with other places in 17th Ave."}
{"text":"80th & Ivy, you're ok... 

I've been here numerous times.  Generally, the food is good, the tables are full (make a reservation or prepare to wait) and the services is alright.

I really like a lot of the dishes - the 1/4 chicken is amazing (though massive), dips are really good, and the duck two ways is fantastic.  I do wish they had a little bit more selection in small plates, though, and some non-dairy based desserts (though that's just my allergy talking).

The service generally leaves a little to be desired - often a fairly long wait to get a drink or see a server.  Maybe they just have too many tables?

Overall, for a nice night out, this is a pretty good choice."}
{"text":"I had lunch here with some girlfriends last weekend. I've been once before for drinks and this was the first time dining here. The decor is beautiful! I really like the space and how it's set up, it's nice and bright and the bathrooms are clean and cute (I like having my own sink!).

Now I'm really not a fan of the service. Why is the waitress shaking my hand and introducing herself, while asking for my name? It's awkward and it's weird. The drinks were great...the Ivy Lemonade was sooo yummy!! We ordered the Mushroom Dip to start, it was sooo tasty. We also had the Scallops & Prawns, and I was a little disappointed. The dish was super small and it wasn't hot either. I had the burger with salad and I really enjoyed it! Very juicy and tons of flavor. My girlfriends weren't as into their food, the consensus was that the dishes were just bland. Our server also kept forgetting things (like water, who ordered what, and to check on us...) so I wasn't thrilled about that. It was also pretty pricey for what you get. I probably wont return, unless it's just for drinks."}
{"text":"I'm a little torn, teetering between a 3 star and a 4. 
I'll start with why on many occasions I've been very unhappy here. 
The service attitude. I'm not talking about the server though. I'm talking about the hostesses. I don't understand why they need to give everyone the look down before seating them, and the \"here\" throw down your menus attitude. Oh, you wanna change tables? PSSSSSSSH dare you anger the hostess gods?! They are like, soooo busy. (On a Sunday afternoon, only 2 other tables seated). 
Seriously. Get a new host staff cause no one needs guard dogs at a restaurant entrance. Roll your eyes AFTER you turn around because we can see you!!!!!
Or am I the only one getting that kind of attitude? 

Aside from getting in, the food and atmosphere is well worth the dog show. High top tables on the first floor, bar seating, relaxed kick back kind of the space.  Wood with industrial steel accents. Very cool lighting decor. Brightly lit, space with floor to ceiling windows. 
Upstairs is a moody dining space that shares an open view into the kitchen. 
Both spaces offer a spectacular menu. After work hours and evenings tend to get very very loud, it is an open space with no barriers with the exception of one between lounge and dining.

The mixed drinks are yummy. Server told us the bartender originally came from Earls (I could have remembered wrong, Moxies?). Everything I have had so far has been nothing short of goodness. The highlight and my personal favorite is the butter chardonnay prawns. Order another side of bread because you'll want to have the rest of the sauce. Try the meat sharing board. It's huge and good for a few people to pick at. Rich and delicious, prawns are juicy, meat is tender.  The food here is just as good as the drinks. 

And just as I'm in complete food heaven....I'll see the host staff standing around whispering to each other, both look at a table or patron and whisper again with smirks or giggles. I am not the only one to notice this and I find this to be extremely rude. 

I'm regretful that I can't give 80th & Ivy the 5 stars it deserves, but I don't tolerate this kind of behavior in any shape or form.

Review #11 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012"}
{"text":"Wow, I didn't expect an hour long wait for a table when I showed up at 80th & Ivy on Wednesday to meet a friend for drinks around 8pm. Luckily, we spied a couple of empty seats at the bar and snagged 'em.

I remember popping into this building when it was a temporary Halloween outlet store. My drinking mate thought she recalled it being an adult store in its yonder years. You wouldn't guess it now! There are two levels happening, the front with the patio seems more lounge-y with a few higher bar-style tables. As I peered through to the back end, it was a darker decor and looked more restaurant-y. If you get a chance, take a peek at the lighting/chandelier thing. It's cool! 

Sitting at the bar was definitely the way to go. Since there were only two of us, I think it's the only way we were actually able to hear each other! This joint is LOUD. And not because the music is pumpin'... I can't even remember if there was any music playing. But the acoustics with that many people inside are crap. So, if you're looking for an intimate dinner and drink experience, it's not your ideal choice. But a big group of friends? Have at 'er!

The food is delicious. We shared duck two ways (Crispy duck croquettes, oven roasted pear and local Acacia honey pastilla) and Sylvan Star fondue (melted gruyere, shallot and berry compote, prosciutto crisp & house baked brioche). The duck was fantastic! little spring roll type bites on one side of the plate and little duck balls on the other. And the fondue was made for baby bear... the size was just right! Tip: Don't be afraid to scoop a healthy serving of cheese onto your brioche. There's more than enough to go around!

The cocktails fit right in with the craft cocktail craze hitting Calgary right now. Every drink is carefully made from scratch. The name of the game isn't \"pump the drinks out as fast as we can\" here, it's \"let's make sure each one is just right.\" My first cocktail was the Ramos Gin Fizz - Hendrix gin, St. Germain liqueur, cream , fresh lemon and lime juice, egg whites. It was light and refreshing. And what was that little spritz from the blue bottle that went on top? A little eau de orange blossom. For real! They even spritzed it into the air for me to smell a bit. Delightful.

Next up, an Old Fashioned made with Maker's Mark bourbon, Angostura and cherry bitters and a raw sugar cube. I love me my bourbon. A little burn on the orange peel to get that citrus-y taste flowing and I was a happy camper.

We finished off with dessert. A lemon tart and chocolate cinnamon cake. At $8 a dessert, I was impressed with portion! The tart was as big as my hand and the cake came with two healthy triangles of cake and brown butter ice cream. It went oh-so-nicely with my Old Fashioned. And it wasn't over poweringly chocolatey, instead, my tongue found a nice balance of cinnamon to chocolate.

Sounds like everything was amazing, right? It was. Minus the noise level, it was a solid 4 star experience. The only real damper on the evening was finding one of my biggest restaurant pet peeves. And it's one I will always remove a star for... because unless you're a nightclub, it's a rather dick restaurant move to make. When it came time to pay, I brought out my debit card... wouldn't you know it, 80th & Ivy doesn't take debit. Only credit or cash. There's an ATM at the front with a 3 dollar charge. For real you guys? You're classier than that. Get rid of the ATM."}
{"text":"So came here for Sunday brunch. It was dead. I think there was all of 3 tables there.
Food was ok. Nothing wowed me... especially for the price.   The beef cubes (can't remember the name) was kind of tough... 

Anywho, would I come back? Maybe but it would not be my suggestion."}
{"text":"The brunch here is really not all that great. The buffet runs $25 per person and was like eating something you expect the first settlers would of eaten to preserve their food with. I'm not an overly picky eater and am a big fan of brunch. This place however just didn't do it for me and I wouldn't go back. Very nice venue but I'd skip on the brunch. The waitress came by like twice the entire time despite being relatively quiet but on previous visits another waitress visited me enough to call part of the family (hit or miss basically)."}
{"text":"Welcome to IKEA!  I mean, 80th and Ivy.  This is not meant to be offensive in any way, but the open concept with a bright atmosphere and funky lighting, industrial looking chairs, exposed kitchenware storage, etc. makes me feel like I'm dining in the store.  It's all good, though.

Be aware that the noise level is insane when it's busy.  With a party of three last night, we struggled to hear one another.  It's worth the visit for the food, so just know that you may be on the verge of yelling at your accompaniment(s), especially if you are seated far from each other.  

If you don't have a reservation, I wouldn't bother coming here unless it's for lunch.  The entrance is small and there's nowhere to sit so if you wait, you stand and possibly shoulder to shoulder.  I saw people leaving after half an hour because they likely couldn't take it anymore.

Our table received stellar service.  I don't know if it's because my friend had a slight connection to the restaurant, but I was blown away and felt like royalty.  If everyone is treated this way, this alone would entice me to return.  It really made for an awesome experience.  

Every dish with the exception of the Wild Forest Mushrooms was absolutely delicious.  The 'sh rooms were pretty plain.  I'm most excited about the Medjool Dates.  Wow.  I've never had anything like it but that's the coolest \"new to me\" food I've had in a long time.  It is sweet and salty brilliance.  The Rotisserie Chicken Flatbread, Sirloin Bites (with a dip I'd just call awesomesauce) and Beignes (french donuts with a side of ice cream) were all flavorful and fantastic.  

The hallway with single restrooms idea is great.  You have a toilet, sink and mirror all to yourself without disruption.  Also, the location of the restaurant is good because it's not in the heart of 17th Ave and parking is a little easier to find.

I'd come back to 80th and Ivy in a heartbeat, but just with a small party."}
{"text":"Perhaps it was 6 days of Stampeding, perhaps it was the heat, chances are it was the company, but I has the most remarkable evening at one of Calgary's newest (and I'm betting soon to be hottest) new restaurants on 17th.  Besides the company i was keeping that evening, the experience at 80th & Ivy, like it's food, was superb... we had 6 different \"small plates\" all outstanding but one in particular is a must have along any other dish you may order: The chorizo stuffed, bacon wrapped dates. There are no words to describe it really; it was a scintillating explosion of flavors in my mouth! Sweet, salty, spicy, all in and around one decadent little date. Heaven!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I were in the area and looking for somewhere good to eat. We have tried many restaurants on 17th and never saw this one before. I have read about it but thought it was much further on 17th than it was. The restaurant is all windows so you can see in when driving by. It looked busy and fun so we decided to give it a go. 
Walked in and had the option of sitting in the bar area on a high top or up the stairs to the back where the dining room is. We opted for the dining room and got a nice cozy corner.
The service was good, only thing is that we got my salad with the dressing on it (when I asked for it on the side) which happens to me all the time so I am used to it. Surprisingly they re-made my salad super fast and it was yummy!
We ordered
Beet & Arugula salad to share $13
Winter Salad $14 
Market Vegetables $7
8 oz \"blackened\" certified angus beef ribeye $28
Everything was great and good portions.
We look back to coming here again in the near future :)"}
{"text":"We had a family celebration here last night. First time for us except our daughter who picked the spot. 
Lots of energy in the room with a lot of noise. It was hard to hear conversation across the table. Room was initially cool and the high top chairs were uncomfortable.
Gorgonzola mushroom dip and pulled pork sliders were great. My main of rotisserie lamb was good but would not recommend.
Service was good and attentive.

{"text":"This place was awful. The service was average. The wait time was 1.5 hrs for our food. I don't care how busy it is. We made reservations for this too. Just saying, if you have a big party come in for dinner you plan for that dinner. Would not recommend at all. Go elsewhere. Anywhere but here. Also, the kitchen staff just screamed at each other for the 3 hrs that we were there. Awful. Manager on duty (Jordan) didn't even apologize to us. Brutal."}
{"text":"We had decided to try 80th and ivy after taking a look at the very tempting menu online for a late dinner. There was no wait for the two of us. 
The set up of tables in 80th and ivy is stylish, intimate and cosy, except it wasn't that easy to be intimate when I was short of yelling to be heard over other loud conversations. :)
The decor is very cool, with exposed piping and industrial style lighting and furniture. 
We ordered the ivy salad, duck, sirloin bites and a side of mushrooms. I highly recommend the duck and sirloin bites! They took the fusion approach and the result was delicious! The servings were generous and we didn't have any room for dessert. 
The service was adequate and the cocktails were mediocre but I would definitely return for the food and comfy bench seats!"}
{"text":"The wine is very good... The appetizers delicious, the ambience is super nice and the service is excellent!!... I would definitely recommend this place, and look forward to go back there soon!!"}
{"text":"Steak bites and Greek ribs were great, although I don't condone the Greeks selling their ribs to boost their economy. Patio is good for a warm summer day of drinking and watching the local riffraff stroll by, and the interior is tastefully decorated for those looking to impress on that awkward first date or silent and dull 10 year wedding anniversary dinner. It is a bit pricey for those pinching their pennies, so if that's an issue there is a delicious KFC across the street."}
{"text":"From the nice looking patio to the spacious interior, I wanted to like my first time at 80th and Ivy. I had tried to make reservations for a table of three, calling a few times over a few days but there was no answer. When we got there, the patio was full but luckily there were quite a few tables open in the back area, next to the open kitchen (we managed to arrive right before the dinner rush, by 6:30, all of the tables were full). My French 75 was good, with the right amount of lemon, and though they were out of Rose for my friend's drink order, the waiter suggested a white wine instead. The rotisserie of juicy looking chicken was tempting us from the kitchen, but in the end, we ordered the duck two ways, the chicken silders, the fondue, and the tuna and watermelon salad. The food was just ok, not very much watermelon in the salad, not much flavour in the chicken, and the duck two ways was good but a bit dry. The fondue was decent, with a berry compote at the bottom that you had to dig for, but our issue was that we were only given bread and more bread to dip with.  Where is the fruit, 80th and ivy? Show me the fruit!
Finally, to end this on a real whimper, the server was really attentive at first, when the dining room was not very full, but our waters stayed empty, our empty plates sat on the table, and we had to catch his eye a few times to order dessert once the place filled up. 
Because of it's convenient location on 17th and the great space, I'm willing to try 80th and Ivy again, maybe some of their entrees next time, but for now, meh meh meh."}
{"text":"I have the same problem with 80th and Ivy every single time we end up here. The food is great- but the service is just not good! It's also very noisy so it's close to impossible to have a conversation. 

This last time went there literally all the tables around us needed to be cleaned up and they just sat like that. It was as if no one even worked there. It took a solid 15 minutes before our presence was even acknowledged. Once we were given menus it once again took forever before the server came back to see what we wanted. Then she never checked in with us again and we had to hunt her down to get our bills. This isn't the first time we've received service like this here. We come back because the food is pretty good but I really don't think we will be back after that last time."}
{"text":"Had drinks with some friends. Not too crowded but not dead either. Waitress was very nice but forgot to bring out or drink order."}
{"text":"A social-drinky-foody-goody people watching spot! 

We are part-time regulars here - especially in the summer - because we like 80th & Ivy's street-side outdoor space and it's location on 17th avenue SW for people watching. Socializing and people-watching with friends is really the main reason we go here and everyone enjoy's watching the interesting or wtf or attractive or musical or sometimes comical people that cruise the 17th avenue strip. You never know who you are going to see... and you would be surprised at how many people roam up and down 17th (in-vehicle and on-foot). 

Overall, 80th & Ivy is a decent place to strike up a conversation with another table, which ends up happening often there. It's a good place to be social even if you had not planned on it. And today did not disappoint.

From our experience, the customer service is always good and you will find that the staff are generally enthusiastic and very welcoming when you walk in the door. You never have to wait long for food or drink either, which is something we take note of no matter where we dine. 

Since we have made a point to try the entire menu I will list a few recommendations:

- Bacon wrapped dates
- Tempura prawn skewers
- Cajun chicken sandwich
- Ivy burger
- Rotisserie chicken
- Ahi tuna
- Beet & blackberry salad
- Buck o'shuck oysters

Thanks 80th & Ivy,

Shane K."}

{"text":"I feel both guilty and enthused to give this place two stars. I want to give 2.5 but I am not willing to round up.

I have been here twice now and feel that a review is warranted based on these visits. It's relatively new, it's decently busy, and many friends have gone...I have expectations on such a hot spot. I except to be wowed!

Not so much unfortunately.

We waited 35 minutes for a seat (we were told it was 20 minutes), the whole time staring at the empty communal table. Once seated at the above-mentioned table, we were told, \"our group of 20 didn't show and we waited an hour\"! Who waits an hour for a reso on a Friday night with paying people waiting? I feel that's a bad business move.

We are seated and the waitress is decently attentive at the start. That said, the lag between each visit in regards to ordering or bringing drinks was twice as long as it should be (or is normal elsewhere). We order two bottles of wine and the standard Q water. Upon her return to order, I ask, \"What is there for vegetarians?\" (I ask because the menu actually says \"ask for special vegetarian options\"...what does she do, she points out what's in front of me that doesn't have meat. THANKS TIPS! I already did that, and asked if there was anything different not listed as it appeared there would be. There isn't. (I don't know why the comment then to ask them about the options?!).

Appies arrive and the mushroom dip was pretty amazing and the others had the pulled pork sandwiches, which were ok. They were cold but she said they were supposed to be? Cold pulled pork sandwiches? Not sure that's a good decision.

...time passes...waitress checks in to say \"its coming\"...

...time passes - we notice all the rest of the patrons who sat after us at out communal table, were just about done their mains???...

Food arrives. Two hours after we sat down...the chicken flat bread was cold (who cannot properly time a flatbread?), and was clearly cooked and removed from the oven 20 minutes before the other meat mains. The fish was luke warm but tasty, the special of the evening - the prime rib was said to be delicous but luke warm with accompanying veggies that were hot. I ordered the fettuccine which should have been easy to serve up...I waited...waited...no waitress...ten minutes later the \"day manager\" brought out my mini sized main dish of fettuccine which was, barely luke warm...thanks guys... my friends are done and I'm eating cold pasta that is wayyyy to salty. Special. No apologies and no follow-up on taste...very poor/mediocre service. I expect far better for the price point and expectations.

The day manager again came by to talk to one of our party who voiced concerns over delays, service and cold food... and she was great she offer TWO desserts to a table of FOUR people. He asked for one each. Nope.. she was maxing out at TWO! that's fantastic service...ugh. Seriously manager person? Awful. Awful.

The two desserts came out and both were very meh. A crème brulee that was tasty, accompanied by VERY burnt ginger snaps. I guess for the free desert that had a way to use those up!!! The other was the chocolate mousse, which was very meh, with a weird citrus gelatin on the top that had no flavor, only to add a gelatinous texture to a mousse? Weird decision. I didn't eat much of either - it wasn't worth the calories:)

Overall, food was ok on taste, ok on service, bad on heat, bad on senior manager service and AWFUL on timing. My first visit was almost identical on their early opening. Food was cold and congealed at that visit and the service was way too slow and non-attentive. 

Calgary has a LOT of new and happening places with great food, many of which I have been to many times and would give five stars to each time. This was worth the two stars on each visit, so I shall not return. There are far better options in our fantastic city.

as a very final note.. the music is far too loud for a restaurant.."}
{"text":"Am I the only one who reads the sign as Goth and Ivy?
Aside from their poor font choice, 80th and Ivy is a pretty sweet deal adding to 17th Ave's patio scene.

I really have enjoyed their bevvies, Wednesday nights they offer a selection of 30 bottles of wine for 30 dollars. They make some pretty delicious (and might I add deadly) 2 oz cocktails, Big Man on Campus is a must have. I would also recommend the Caipirinha.

I am not sold on 80th's food though. The House Crisp Focaccia & dipping platter, I loved the mushroom dip, but the roasted red pepper dip was too runny for my liking and the bean dip was meh.
The ivy salad was also a lot smaller than I was expecting for $16 and again was underwhelming. I did enjoy the rotisserie chicken flatbread (fancy name for BBQ chicken pizza), but that might just be due to the fact that chicken and bbq sauce on bread is one of my favourite things to eat.

My lasting thought really is: 80th and Ivy, not for goths and good to drink at, not to eat."}
