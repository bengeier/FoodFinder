{"text":"Fairly flavorless but it's practically in sight of my house so they get my business."}
{"text":"Delicious Chinese food. I take out from here all the time. The egg rolls are good, the wonton soup is good, and the chicken lo mien is the best I have ever tasted. Highly recommended by me."}
{"text":"This place used to be my go to for Americanized Chinese. Generous lunch portions, however my last visit was bad. After trying to get through on the phone for 10 minutes I tried just driving over. When entering there was someone picking up an order that was not ready the girl (I've never seen there before) went straight into the back without asking me if I needed any help. I assumed she'd be back soon but never came back. The owner came out a few minutes later attended to some business then she headed to the back as well. A new couple entered, the younger girl acknowledge the new couple said their order was not ready ignored me yet again and disappeared. Having been slighted several times I thought I'd attempt to call from in their restaurant. Through the window I saw the \"new girl\" in her Beachwood grey hoodie hang up the phone immediately after picking up my call.  

Horrible customer service Happy Budah. You used to have a very loyal customer."}
{"text":"This was the worst Chinese food I have ever been served. Connective tissue passed off as chicken, burnt noodles, undercooked vegetables served cold. Salty sauce with the consistency of hair gel. Look elsewhere or do your research, this place pads the negative reviews with several of their own. Save your time and money."}
{"text":"Crab Rangoons were still cold in the middle and we didn't feel like we got enough food for the price."}
{"text":"Ambiance: Casual, relaxed. 
Food: 5/5; Best \"takeout\" Chinese food in Cleveland - and possibly NE OH. 
Location: Right next to a Green and Cedar, across the street from Heinen's. 
Pricing: Reasonably priced and portioned for the most part.
Service: 5/5; Shirely is very friendly and accommodating. Food is cooked very fast. 

Brightly colored and comfortable inside, there's only one large table, three four tops, and two two tops. Plan accordingly if you're planning on bringing a large party because they will move tables together. Once saw a party of 12 in there - cramped but look like they were having a great time. 

While the inside is small and doesn't seem like much, the food is out of this world! Yes it's Americanized but it's mainly a takeout place - what do you expect? Very cheap food that's definitely more than worth the price. I've tried most of their entrees - from General Tso's to their Pad Thai (which, by the way, is one of the best I've had). I'm a big fan of their LoMein and miss their friend rice very much now that I'm in a different state. However, whenever I come back to town I make sure to stop by at pick up some hot and sour soup and crab rangoons along with whatever else I'm craving. Which, right now, is their Szechuan green beans and their shrimp crackers. 

And is it weird that I usually order their chicken wings when I stop by? They are delish as well. It depends on where I'm staying but I usually try to stay away from anything fried only when doing takeout because it's fried! For dishes like the sweet and sour shrimp/ chicken/etc and egg foo youngs, they do poke holes in the styrofoam to help release some heat and keep the food crispy. I love how they also do the same for the soup container (which they then bag) because I've had soups from other places explode from the heat and resultingpressure. 

Speaking of soups - fresh soups garnished with freshly chopped scallions and pork? Yes please! From freshly made wontons in their wonton soup to their delicious egg drop soup to their daily made hot and sour, it's hard to choose one!

Basically, EAT HERE."}
{"text":"Above average food, great service, super prices. The dining area isn't all that cozy, but we usually carry out. Love the fried rice and lo mein."}
{"text":"My favorite \"go to\" takeout that is local...  I always get the chicken and shrimp pad thai.   It is an amazing portion for the price. They have a great amount of meat in it too! Always consistent yummy taste too! My husband and I get it a few times a month! My son always gets the beef or pork lo mein and happily kills it! The lady who is working there is always super friendly and the food is always ready and my order is always correct! Love it here!"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic Chinese restaurant tucked into a strip center.  The decor isn't much to look at, however the portions are huge, the food taste is excellent and the owner is very friendly.  We have had dine in and take out many times and the food is tasty and consistent.  Fan favorites in our family include the chicken ho fun, chicken and corn soup, pan fried noodles with vegetables, as well as many other assorted dishes.  They are very accommodating if you would like to alter any of the dishes to your taste including the vegetables included or the level of spice.  Call in take out orders have always been completed correctly and make it home piping hot.  A good quality low cost Chinese restaurant is always a good friend on a night when you just don't feel like cooking!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is quite small; there are only 7 maybe 8? tables.  The service was very polite and  attentive.

I ordered chicken and vegetables with brown rice and tried the hot and sour soup.  Meh on the hot and sour soup.  I've had better.  It was a little thick for soup.  

The chicken and vegetables were fine, definitely healthy with very little oil on my plate.  I can't speak for their other dishes, but  I'll be back to try others. 

The price was right.  My meal with brown rice and a large egg drop soup to-go was $14 and I have enough left overs for another meal.   Most of their entrees are about $7-9. Soup is only $1.25-1.65 depending on which one you order.  

It's a good value for what you get and it's quick. It probably wouldn't be my choice for a special night out, but if you are done with work, tired and don't feel like cooking I think Happy Buddha is an okay option.  

4 stars for service
3 stars for food

So I'll round up to 4 stars overall, even though a 3.5 star review seems like it would be more appropriate. 

It would be nice to see a small establishment like this do well.  There aren't enough Mom and Pops restaurants around."}
{"text":"First time there for dinner....quaint, nice little place. Felt like we were in a private dining room. Wonton soup was absolutely delicious. My husband ordered sweet and sour pork and I had the Seschwan Beef....which were very good and the portions were huge. Great service!"}
{"text":"Service is great. Shirley is such a nice lady. Fried rice is really good. Much better than your average Chinese. I've layed off due to overly greasy egg foo Yung."}
{"text":"Just wanted to add a minor, yet awesome note.

On our recent take-out order, they poked holes in the top of the container with the chicken so that the moisture would not make it soggy.

May sound like nothing big, but it made a huge difference in the quality of the meal."}
{"text":"The food was awesome, and the prices can't be beat. The hostess was very knowledgable and was able to advise which items on the menu could be made vegetarian, and which could not. On that note, just about anything on the menu could be made vegetarian, which is rare for a Chinese restaurant. Definitely visiting this place again."}
{"text":"Well just as in Detroit Metro, searching greater Cleveland for yummy (slightly Americanized) Chinese food that lives up to my snobby California standards has proved to be a challenge. We have tried several highly rated places near us and they were not up to my snuff. 

Step in Happy Buddha Cafe - Please consider starting delivery service - PLEASE!!! We have had take-out a few times, and I have really enjoyed the food. I don't love the drive, or the tiny parking lot - especially when its 30 degrees outside.

We've tried several of the dishes - Honey Walnut Chicken, Orange Beef, Peking style Pork, Veg fried Rice - all delicious!

The inside of the restaurant is super tiny, but there have always been tables available when I've gone to pick up food."}
{"text":"always very good food. I enjoy most parts of their menu and to encourage to try all parts of the menu. There is something for everyone.  Also this restaurant is always willing to accomadate and change a dish to fit your liking. definitely worth a try in my opinion."}
{"text":"I wish I could give them 3.5 stars. I wrestle between 3 and 4 stars for this restaurant. The location is great and the parking plentiful between what is available upfront and in the back. I came for lunch  and it was very relaxed. Surroundings were spartan.  Food is very good---what makes this place good is the price.  With luncheon specials at 5.95 and 6.95 one can't beat the value.  The food was good--not special--but again I don't know many places with this type of food for that price in the neighborhood.

I will go again at lunch---probably by myself or with a friend for a quick meal--and really appreciate the staff."}
{"text":"I ordered from Happy Buddha again after a long hiatus, and I now feel I need to update my review.  We ordered: beef and broccoli, Bbq pork lo mein, egg roll, wonton soup and kung po chicken.  
First:  they must have a different chef, because everything was a lot more like the downtown Chinese places like Bo Loong, Ho Wah, and Gourmet Wonton BBQ and less like the chain or suburban spots.  What this means is: fresher veggies and less pre-made stuff.  Your wonton won't be soggy, your Bbq pork won't be chopped into teeny tiny shreds in your lo mein, it'll be big pieces and it will be perfect.  
The vegetables were steamed perfectly, not mooshy, and they were bright green and had a crunch.  The soup had plenty of wonton and it wasn't soggy.  
The only cons: not enough white rice for family style dinner, it should come with a lot more. And also the portions seemed a lot smaller in general, more like lunch portions, but the quality is superb, even better than last time I had it."}
{"text":"They have the best authentic cantonese style dishes on the east side especially if you don't feel like driving downtown.  Most of the menu is american chinese style take out food, but there are quite a few traditional cantonese gems that are prepared quite well. Fresh, made to order, usually fast and reasonably priced.  

Things to try:
Pad thai: cantonese influence
'wet' chow fun (which is actually ho fun - the flat rice noodles); dry chow fun is also great
Pan fried noodles
salt baked squid
yeung chow fried rice"}
{"text":"Fav place to go for lunch, always great service and food is authentic/delicious. Small dining setting and never too crowded despite the awesome food. Some of the best Chinese food in Cleveland, highly recommend the Orange chicken special!"}
