{"text":"Great coffee. Not an expert so I can't really comment on the details of the roast or texture or technique (see other reviews), but it tasted pretty damn good. My friend who IS a coffee snob agreed.  But wow, the barista (the owner I think) is such an awesome guy! Super nice and friendly, with a highly infectious energy that truly shows how passionate he is about the drinks he makes. The store is right next to the entrance of the Assembly Chef's Hall, and when we walked out after a couple of hours he thanked us with such fierce enthusiasm that I was tempted to stop and get another cup right then and there lol. I would actually come back just to see the smile on his face again (errrrr, I meant that in the most non-weird way possible). Here's to hoping they open other locations ASAP - will be recommending to all my friends (coffee snobs or otherwise)."}
{"text":"Friendly baristas and good coffee with a flare for presentation (rainbow latte).    The rainbow latte was really pretty to look at, but nothing too amazing in terms of taste. My girlfriend enjoyed her matcha latte. It was rich and silky without being too sweet.    It was my first time at Assembly Hall, but i'll definitely swing by Bulldog Coffee again if i'm in the area again."}
{"text":"Bulldog has great coffee, and the owner Stuart is a sweetheart! Came here to try their coffee, but couldn't make a decision on which to get. Ultimately, decided to try something more Instagramable and ordered the rainbow latte. It sure brightened up my Saturday morning!  Bulldog gets their coffee blend from a supplier that Stuart has consistently ordered from for years (ever since Bulldog opened). It's a great blend and the latte was so good and beautiful!"}
{"text":"The barista at Bulldog sure makes a great latte. One of the best lattes I've had!"}
{"text":"Came here just for the rainbow latte & it did not disappoint. Dont come on sundays because its closed fyi.   The barrister was so amazing & friendly - he knew i wanted a great shot and video and he told me he has perfected it to his customers liking! Super sweet man. Saw a marshmallow expresso in a glass martini cup being made and that looked so cool with the torched fire at the end! Might just go back for that next time."}
{"text":"I met Stuart for the first time... he fired up his torch and melted down some marshmallows for his signature latte. It tastes so smooth and amazing I had to get the rainbow latte after just to upload to Instagram. I sat up at the coffee bar and wiggled to the amazing music and shared a lot of laughs with Stuart and Angie. Both amazing coffee artists. Love to see passion in the fields!  See you both soon"}
{"text":"Having coffee with Stuart has become a daily ritual.  You can truly taste the difference of a coffee pulled by someone that cares.    Pro Tip: Stuart bakes his own pastries."}
{"text":"Love these guys! Perfect matcha latte (just sweet enough) and they are so friendly! The protein ball was delish too. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love Bulldog is back!   new place, new drinks but same old Ross!!!  Great to see the coffee master is back and better than ever!  And lots of new designs and pastry.    Don't leave again!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know about you but.. this would be my ideal co-working space for the early morning weekdays. Right now, the space is pretty empty so that tells me that this hasn't caught on yet! Ya get delicious coffee, amazing baked goods, large communal tables, industrial decor, healthy amount of ambient noise...   Had the espresso here and was served by SUCH friendly staff. Totally brightens my day! @Stuart Ross: you and your espresso cup collection are awesome."}
{"text":"Was having a bad day so needed to get myself a treat.  Enter Marshmallow Latte ($6+tax) from Bulldog Coffee.  Shortly after drinking it, everything seems right in the world. A unique drink you won't find anywhere, martini glass is filled with marshmallows and drizzled with chocolate sauce and a shot of espresso. Not overly sweet (provided you don't finish the marshmallows) and pretty with the torched marshmallows.  Stuart the owner, is such a sweet guy and always smiling.  You can tell how passionate he is about his coffee place. Prices are reasonable and justifies the drink cost.  Can't wait to come back and try their rainbow latte."}
{"text":"Bulldog Coffee is located in Assembly Hall, a great place with great eats. I went in for the Rainbow latte and they were so nice. The latte tastes good and it's very pretty!   Keep Eating,  Angela"}
{"text":"Got a rainbow latte with almond milk. The most instagram-able drink ever haha.  $6 is definitely pricey for a few drops of colour, but a latte from Starbucks is almost $6.  The latte is solid. Comes with two espresso shots and a whole lot of beauty. I'd give it a 4.5 stars.  It's located inside the Assembly Chef's Hall. Most of the food places don't open until 11am so it's a great place to go if you want to grab a coffee from Bulldog Coffee and work or just chill off lunch and dinner peaks."}
{"text":"Get rainbow latte,super unique color, but nothing special onw the taste. It's a great experience to try. And the service. is great."}
{"text":"I knew about this place in it's former location, and liked it then! Wasn't sure what to expect when I saw where it had moved too. It took a couple of times in the Hall to find it as it's in the back corner, tucked away. I have to say though, the staff is Very friendly, they smile at my Bad jokes, the service is top notch, the coffee is excellent, and there Brownie, OMG, if your a chocolate addict like me, It's Insanely good! It Could last you a good hour to eat, several of the people I work with have become addicted to it like me!!"}
{"text":"I got the nutella-flavoured rainbow latte and a chocolate chip cookie - both were delicious!"}
{"text":"I only stayed for a bit, but wish I could've stayed longer. Bulldog Coffee is located inside Assembly Chef's Hall on the first floor of Google's Canada Headquarters. I opted for one of their signature drinks, the Rainbow Latte, that's as sweet as it is pretty, no need for added sugar in this one. They add food coloring to the steamed milk and then pour into the glass in a cute leafy pattern, making an instagram worthy treat for sure. They don't have dedicated seating of their own, but there are plenty of communal picnic tables and benches, filled with cuties on their breaks from their jobs in the financial district."}
{"text":"Get the rainbow latte and do it for the 'gram! Really great service too. I started walking away and they ran after me and said, \"Do you want to watch??\" Duh!! The process was so cool and the picture was worth it! The latte tasted delicious (no extra flavor, just food coloring)."}
{"text":"Bulldog is now in Assembly Chefs Hall on Richmond West at York! Their Bulldog Latte is an excellent finish to a delicious meal in the Hall or for a morning break. Lots of seating and there are other drink choices too. Accessible from the concourse or Richmond street."}
{"text":"Pardon me as I write and scarf down the almond peanut butter vegan ball along with my two shots of caffeine with almond milk Bull Dog latte!!!!  Deliciousness ALL the way, cool above ground food court, if you're walking toward Yonge on Richmond st just look for the RED A that's the Assembly food court...and this joint along with the others Is nestled right at the front!!  Sooo this place is definitely giving Jimmy's Coffee some major competition....great friendly staff and great addition to downtown core :-D"}
{"text":"In my experiences around the world, a great food hall needs a lot of passionate chefs, some great local beers or wines, and a very passionate barista.  What Assembly Chef's hall has given to Toronto, it's hitting all those points very well.  Toronto's Assembly offers 2 coffee spots to give you that caffeine kick and one of them is Bulldog.  I'll start this off simply... Stuart is one of those rare baristas.  His enthusiasm and passion for all things coffee is infectious.  One day I have to try the other coffee spot around the corner, but Stuart's charisma is great and it'll be hard to pull myself to try the other.  Bulldog is housed in the brand new modern and industrial chill vibe of Assembly's Chef hall.  It also the first floor of the new Google building... those engineers have it good.  Bulldog has it's own spot sitting amidst the seating area.  So if you're like me and taking snaps of your drink... its not a far walk to your table (ha!).  His barista area is clean and gleams ... not only from the gorgeous espresso machines & beer on tap, but also Stuart's awards and recognition over the years.    I love how Stuart sourced his own bean blend and was saying that's his same blend since he started.  I also loved how honest he was about his other drinks... he has chai latte on the menu.  I asked him if he made his own ... he said flat out \"no... I can never make it as good as an Auntie. I'm all about the coffee.\" (paraphased by me) That's blunt but I appreciate the truth.    Flat White with lactose free milk - I had to laugh when I asked him if he did flat whites (it wasn't on the menu).  With the most expressive energetic face, he said \"OF COURSE... I'm ALL about coffee.\" and then pointed to his shiny awards about wins and being a judge.  Well then!  While he made the flat whites, I had a great conversation about how he uses his own special blend of 7 types and how he likes to make his own treats ... especially the protein balls.  Clearly this guy loves having his hands all in and make his own.. kudos on that.  As for the flat white... simply said, beautiful latte art on top of a rich and smooth drink.  His bean choice leans more towards a fruitier finish and lighter than some of the other bolder flat whites in the city.  (Of course Stuart can tell me i'm all wrong!).  I like a darker roast and more deep robust flavours but I have to say that this was enjoyable and smooth.  I think everyone can appreciate this flat white even if you're new to coffee.  Very approachable drink... just like the man who made it.  4/5  Protein balls - Grabbing a quick snack, Stuart mentioned he made all of these himself so we grabbed the sunflower one and another one to nibble one while enjoying our coffee.  These were good... rich in nutty flavours with a good crunchy texture from the various ingredients.  It didnt have a sugary hit that will leave you crashing later.  He said he made these as a healthy snack to give you a boost of energy. Definitely did that!  Liked these two.  4/5  I can't wait to come back to try out the other drinks he has to offer.  I do have to mention that its a one man show so ... line ups do happen but it's worth to talk to Stuart!"}
{"text":"Download the Assembly Hall Application for $5 credit to Bulldog Coffee at Assembly Hall.  I opted for the Rainbow Latte since it looks so pretty!  It came out to $6.05 (around that) and tasted pretty good.  What I didn't like was the attitude of the cashier who was very rude when I tried to give her cash.  It was my first time there and I am more than happy to use a credit card but figured since it was $1.05 (after the credit) cash would just take care of it.  Instead I had to listen to a long rant or lecture on how she is \"cash-free\"--I hope the next time she goes in a rant she takes a look at our laws that in Canada you must accept every form of physical Canadian currency.    Stuart, the owner was a complete 360--very friendly and nice.  If you happen to be on the lady's nice side your experience will be better."}
