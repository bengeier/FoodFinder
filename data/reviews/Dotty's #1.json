{"text":"They suck. I lost my freaking money.  Lol. Other then that the the older waitress lady is pretty cool. It's clean and they keep all the rif raf out."}
{"text":"The \"bartenders\" are super rude. I forgot the pricks name but it was if I was wasting his time just ordering cigarettes."}
{"text":"This Dotty's seems to have the rudest employees!  I've been to several Dotty's in Vegas and I won't go to this one anymore.  The bartender never comes around to offer beverages, and when I asked for one he rudely said I have to put $10 in a machine and play it, even after I had been there 20 minutes and put in a $20. Finally I got a Dr Pepper...just ONE can and had been playing for about 2 hours. I won $100 and left without tipping him! (Usually I tip my bartenders  $5)"}
{"text":"Loved the place, awesome staff especially Betty!! She makes the place fun and even enjoyable when you win or loss. Great environment."}
