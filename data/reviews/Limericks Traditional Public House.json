{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE!!! NOT WORTH IT WHATSOEVER! 
Our server literally told us half our table couldn't order because she needed to type in what we already ordered. WELL that food came out before she did and half of us were well finished eating before the second round came out. RIDICULOUS, will not be back."}
{"text":"Have been there a couple times with work mates and both times the service was sooooo slow. We had to wait sometimes 30 minutes for a drink. The food took a long time and came out cold and disorganized. I thought it was just a one off time, but twice... I don't think I will be back. They did have a good beer selection."}
{"text":"I am not a regular at this pub, but when I am in this pub I act like a regular. 
Anyway, I enjoy the atmosphere and the beer selection.  Service is usually pretty good although on this night there seemed to be some chaos at the bar between the servers and bartenders.  
Regardless of this observation, our drink order was taken and served quickly.  Tried the stuffed Yorkies and they were very good.  4 full - size puddin's are filling. Didn't need the order of bbq sauced wings,  but ate them anyway. These too, were very good! (server recommended).
If you have not been here before try it out!  Balcony is nice on a sunny day!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here almost every weekend. It's our go to for weekend breakfast can't beat $4.99 for Eggs Benny and hash browns! However last night was just awful. To be fair I want to say the service was amazing. The staff was really great and very accommodating to our needs however the food was just off.

We started with the french onion soup and it was barely bath water warm and it was saltier than the ocean. The broth was too salty and too bland lacking other flavors or probably just masked by the amount of sodium in it. Either way it wasn't the greatest.

I find it very hard to screw up basic meals. However I'm not sure what the kitchen staff was up to last night but my dinner did not sit well on the drive home. In fact I drove doubled over for the most part. We had the special that night the pizza. Now being spoiled with home made pizza most of my life is one thing but this was just awful. Ultra thin crust, I ought to have eaten paper. The toppings were off too many in some places and not enough in others. However once I finished eating my meal I felt my stomach do a back flip and twist. I felt violently ill by the time we dropped our friends off. It hit me first but soon my man and I were both doubled over with stomach pains and feeling green (romantic)!

Needless to say we will be taking a break from coming here for a bit.  So it could have been the pizza or the soup but either way both did not sit well with us."}
{"text":"Just like any other bar/pub -- nothing out of the ordinary.  But they get 5 stars for two items -- Innis & Gunn on tap and their chicken, potato, leek and bacon boxty.  Money!"}
{"text":"I really love Limmericks! The food is super tasty and they always have some kind of special going on for either drinks or food. I love sitting by the fireplace and eating my french dip. The mashed potatos are frickin' scrumptious and homemade. Yum Yum! They actually pour fairly strong drinks here, so you definately get your money's worth. So far as service goes, I've had nothing but the best service at this place and I'm VERY picky when it comes to that! The first place I go after I get into Calgary is almost always Limmericks!"}
{"text":"Went there with my cousins to watch the Oilers game and have some wings. We asked 3 different staff to change one of the TVs and they said they will try. The game started and still no Game on any of their TVs. They were showing curling, boxing, soccer, NBA and the Leafs game vs Bruins. Our waitress came back and told us her manager didn't want to change any of the channels. 

We will never go back to this Pub. And don't bother going if you want to watch NHL games."}
{"text":"I have been back a number of times recently and the foot has improved.... A great place for regulars... Kinda like a Cheers! Great tasting fish tacos!"}
{"text":"My favourite wings in Calgary. That simple.

Normally I don't like going for wings because they are dried out and gross. 

These wings are always hot, fresh, and saucy!

My servers are usually slow and forgetful. However, it's made up for with the delicious wings!

Nothing better than chatting with friends with a good beer, and wings, all infront of a cozy fireplace.

I have spent a few nights getting carried away at this pub!"}
{"text":"The service and food was so bad that we felt like we were on a hidden camera show. Unbelievably terrible."}
{"text":"Went for Friday lunch.  Service was terrible, but a bit better than the food.  
Soggy, brown lettuce in my salad.  Will not return."}
{"text":"On my last trip to Calgary, some friends wanted to get together for beer and conversation and told me to meet them here.  While the service was great, and the food was pretty decent pub fare, I found the place too cramped for my liking.  The poor waitress couldn't get past our table unless three of us moved out of the way, and every time the folks at the table behind me stood up, I had the pleasure of being introduced to their elbows.  

Parking was a bit of a nightmare, too.  For a place that seems to be so popular, the parking lot is exceptionally small."}
{"text":"A decent place to bring a load of people, say a work party or softball team and guzzle cheap drinks and food. Enough tvs to make it a good destination for sports days. No issues with the service tonight, cute and friendly and didn't make any obvious mistakes. GIGANTIC flagon of beer for a hair over 8 bucks makes this my new group drink joint. Have to say that made my visit. 
Congratulations, Limericks!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because the appetizers we're good.

We decided to go to Limericks because none of us had been there. So for boyfriends mothers birthday we decided to go there.

To start we ordered the Baby Stuffed Yorkshires -Freshly made mini Yorkshire puddings filled with slow roasted Alberta Beef and served with Original Horseradish Mayo and jus. And the Lamb and Guinness Cheddar Sliders - A trio of fresh made mini Lamb burgers topped with imported Guinness Cheddar cheese, crispy onions and red onion marmalade. 

The appetizers were really  good, but then things went downhill from there. 

Our sever was no where to be seen for some time and when she was around there was no sparkle and she seemed extremely bored.. or high.. I'm not sure which.

Anyway for our mains 

Boyfriend - Spicy Philly Cheese Steak
Slow cooked roast beef piled high with banana peppers, onions and saut√©ed peppers then drizzled with warm cheese sauce on a grilled baguette. 
The cheese sauce looked and smelled like the cheese sauce you get out of a 7-11 Nacho cheese dispenser. The beef didn't seem like it was cooked in au jus at all, it seemed like it was cooked in a steam table or a microwave, and was dry. The fries were burned. The toppings we're almost non- existent. Boyfriend isn't usually one to complain about food, but he was pretty grossed out by this one. Even took to calling them \"bush league\".

Boyfriend Mom- Surprise surprise... she had the steak sandwich again. She seemed pleased with it, and the only complaint she had was there was no seasoning on the steak. Boyfriend and I looked at it, and there wasn't even a speck of pepper or salt of steak rub. The vegetables she had as a side clearly came out of a bag and had again seasoning. 

I had - Cornish Game Hen (half portion)
Free range Game Hen slow roasted to perfection, served with housemade stuffing, Irish champ and its own pan gravy.
First of all it wasn't a Cornish game hen.. it was CLEARLY a chicken, which wasn't cooked all the way through. I thought i was seeing things, but then i double checked with boyfriend and he confirmed it was raw as well. It came with a stupid sprig of fresh rosemary on it that was entirely for decoration. The stuffing was dry and overcooked and what i think was the Irish champ looked like something my cat threw up on the carpet the other day. The only thing that was good about the meal was the potatoes, and there was very little of those. 

Very disappointing.. will not be back for a while."}
{"text":"They have no vegan options (besides yam fries). Even the veggie burger is a no go. Friendly staff and the other food looked OK. Grandpa can get his liver and onions here. For the rest of us there are better places with 21st century options."}
{"text":"Summer 2009
A nice pub atmosphere.  Staff have always been friendly.  Parking can be tricky and mostly have to use side streets behind pub.

This may be because I go on Wednesdays at happy hour when ribs are one cent each with a drink.  Twenty cents gets you a good meal.

I go with a singles group and there is never an issue with separate bills."}
{"text":"Today I am grateful for the good server at Limericks! Melanie did a great job keeping everyone happy! The food was plentiful and flavourful. The atmosphere was really loud but expected. Overall a better experience than I anticipated!"}
{"text":"Limericks is always a solid choice for use. Every once in awhile the service is a little shaky (time wise not friendliness) but the food is always fresh, nicely presented and tasty.

They have a nice range of options from traditional pub fair to some lighter choices. And of course, being a pub, they have an extensive list of beers that should make just about everyone happy. I like just about all of their burgers and the pot pie and boxty's are great when you need comfort food. They have several great appies as well-the scallops are great as is the spicy chili chicken.

The place is huge so its great for groups/busy nights as well. There is a decent amount of parking too which is nice."}
{"text":"Nice place, Good Daily specials and very good happy hour.  Nice selection of beer on tap. Flex taps change frequently which is nice.  Taps do seem to run out on occasion.  Good pub, nice rooftop patio in the summer."}
{"text":"Limericks generally succeeds at what it seems to be trying to do:  be a large \"vanilla\" irish pub which appeals to everyone.  You shouldn't expect to find anything groundbreaking here, but the pub classics meet expectations.  Service is usually quick and attentive.

Limericks is a great place to come watch a sporting event since it has so many TV screens.  They also play pay per view events such as UFC fights, usually without cover charge.  They have specials for every day of the week, which means you can usually find something appealing for a reasonable cost.  

The last time we were here, Mike got the Chicken, Leek and Bacon Boxty.  He really enjoyed it.  I helped myself to a few bites as well.  Boxty's are thin potato pancakes stuffed with various fillings.  This one was rich and creamy, and went well with a pint or two of beer.   I had the Baby Stuffed Yorkshires which I really enjoyed.  They were stuffed with roast beef and came with au jus and horseradish.  These are two more traditional irish pub meals, and we thought they succeeded.

{"text":"Place has gone downhill ... used to go there all the time but it is not the same.  Flames game on have the sound on !!!"}
{"text":"Service is good.  Ribs are cheap 3 cents (up from 1) on Wednesday's.  The menu fare is typical pub style - good variety.  They've got happy hour,  lots of tvs to watch whatever game or UFC match is on.  A lot of seating whether you're upstairs or downstairs.  I prefer upstairs - there is also a balcony w umbrellas for the summer. Overall a decent pub for a large get together for drinks & appies."}
{"text":"Sitting at the Wood is the best. Happy hour gets ya drunk on premium liquor for half the price. Wings on Mondays ribs, on Wensday. The waitresses  well that's another story, Hello Megan. This is the place to be for any drinking occassion especially St. Patty Day"}
{"text":"Been here once, will not go back. Friends can tell me that it's usually better on most nights, but I won't bother again. We sat down on the patio, and was greeted fairly quickly. Got our drink order (2 beer, 1 coke) and it took 30 minutes for us to get them. 30. Minutes. And it wasn't even the same server bringing the drinks to us! Then when we finally got wings (45 minutes after drinks) they were really bad. Poorly cooked and bad sauce. I don't care how many people say \"it's usually good!\" I won't go back. First impressions are important! 

Bonus: after all that poor service she was miffed we asked for exact change back."}
{"text":"Until a few months ago it was a 5. Something has changed recently. First it was the premium wings no loner premium.  Today the nachos were dressy but poor quality. Little cheese and meats in small piles on 4-5 chips.  I've been a patron for years, perhaps decades and have brought countless friends and groups in over the years because the food was so outstanding and the value very good. 

About a year or so ago we noticed a turn over if regular servers but the turn over has been so great that now no one knows who we are.  Not near as happy the servers used to be. 

I'm so disappointed after today's experience when I hosted 6 co-workers and all the comment was,\"we need to do this again but at Boston Pizza next\""}
{"text":"Limericks is an Irish (i think?) pub that is very similar if not indistinguishable from the rest of \"Calgary's best pubs\" such as Kilkenny, Dixon's, Donegal's, the Joyce, and the Seanachie.  Limerick's gets super, super busy, so parking and service can sometimes be problematic.  The food is OK.  Had \"The Crown\" pizza last night, which was overall very bland - pretty much no flavour at all.  I would get it again if I was in the pub drinking beer, however I would never go to Limerick's if I had a hankering for pizza.  The steak sandwich is one of the better ones i've had."}
{"text":"I'm giving Limericks a perfect score because of their very impressive menu (that just so happens to be extremely accommodating towards vegetarians). It's not often that I can eat anything even remotely healthy when I go out to a pub (fries and nachos just aren't gonna cut it as a dinner substitute). At Limericks, they offer salads, soups, pizza, entrees, burgers, wraps, desserts, pot pie, and the list goes on and on - with vegetarian options in pretty much every category! Now THAT is impressive!

In the past, Limericks has been voted as one of Calgary's best pubs and I can most definitely see why.

The staff is great, the location is welcoming, the food is delicious and the selection is vast!

No complaints here!"}
{"text":"Service - Slow
Food - below average
There was no excuse for slow service as we were one of a very few tables for lunch.
Our watress did not ask if we needed any drinks after the initial order after we sat down. We were disappointed with the small portions served."}
{"text":"We went and ate wings on a Wednesday. The service was pretty bad, the server did not look thrilled to be working. Keep in mind it was empty at the bar and in restaurant area upstairs and service was lacking. We waited forever for the bill & refills. On top of that, I also enjoyed a nice 12 hours of food poisoning that night. Will not be returning & I advise others to be cautious."}
{"text":"This past Friday I had the opportunity to drop by here for some drinks with a few old friends. I haven't been here in a decade or so it seems so I decided why the heck not? If parking is an indicator of how great a place could be then Limerick's is good to go. The parking lot is always full and it seems like you have to drive in circles before being able to find a stall to park in.

Our server was friendly, attentive and accommodating as we were trying to find out what we should taste as far as beers go. They had quite a variety and I would definitely come back to taste their other kinds of beer.

We also ordered food to go with our drinks since it was right after work. We had ordered the Jalape√±o Bacon burger that came with fries, the Fish 'n Chips which also came with fries and this Irish Cottage Boxsty?

Everything looked splendid when it came out! The burger was delicious, the fish coda were ginormous and the cottage Boxsty was good enough for my one friend to order a second helping.

Cool place to hang out at!"}
{"text":"\"I think our waitress hates us.\"

Stumbled in here after a night of drinking and bowling. Our waitress didn't seem to be a fan of our table, even though we were mostly sleepy. A table that came in ten minutes after us and ordered similar things got their food before we did. I felt bad for ordering food when people were falling asleep around me waiting for food to show up. 

However, the sweet potato fries were delicious, and the drink menu seems competitively priced and varied. Once the food and drinks started arriving, we got another server, who seemed a lot friendlier. 

I'd come back."}
{"text":"More often than not the service is atrocious. We were one of 2 tables in for brunch an hour after they opened..were brought cold pots of water for tea, luke warm coffee and told they had no orange juice after it was ordered and we had already waited 10 minutes. No spoons provided to stir coffee with...We got the eye roll when we asked for spoons and hot drinks. When the food finally arrived it was fabulous, but did not see our waitress again until she came to bring the bill, which was wrong. 
We went back a few months later, giving the staff the benefit of the doubt. Got the same damn waitress. Waited less time for drinks, and it was busier that morning...food again was fantastic. She screwed up the bill again and then shorted us $20 on the bill when it came to bringing change. If you can avoid her section you might have a great experience."}
{"text":"Good for Mondays wings, the top 3 in Calgary, big and delicious
Large beers. Perfect for patio nights!

Beware.  Service is slow.  Be patient"}
{"text":"Gotta check out the Tuesday taco specials. Super good. Super cheap. Try the fish. Blow your socks off. 

Great food in general. Lots of TVs. UFC. Hockey. Football. Soccer. 

Massive beer selection. Great staff. 

There is a reason this pub has been around so long! Love it."}
{"text":"Limericks... it's ok. The wings are ok, the drinks are ok, the service is ok, most of the food is ok, the price is ok, and the ribs are plain nasty (but only cost a penny!).

 There isn't much to say about this pub, it's not really irish in any way but whatever, I've seen \"western\" bars that play pop and hip hop all night. This is the type of place you go to every once in a while when you can't find anywhere else to go.

 If you're looking to meet an older man (if you like to find 'em at the bar), this is the place to go. It was a total (older)dude-fest the one time I was there. I was literally the only female in the entire lower half, next to the waitress'."}
{"text":"Stopped in to join some friends in raising a glass to a couple that were announcing their engagement. Large open space inside Limmericks is what you will find, clean (bathrooms even!) and it is quite inviting both up and downstairs. It was a Sat night, very busy upstairs and it took a long time to get drinks, the cheque at the end etc but our server was super nice and had no issues with explaining to us what some of her best selling items on the menu were for next time. Hubby liked the beer selection on draft, the temperature of the beer and they had a $2 off Sat night special on import drafts.
I loved the menu, albeit it was quite large but when we are in the hankering for some pub food, we will certainly be back. Whenever a plate off nachos came out - they just looked and smelled amazing!

Handy Tip - the kitchen does not close til 2am but you have to go off the late night menu however anything you could possibly want is still on there.

The crowd was rowdy at certain moments and the music was anything but Irish however everyone seemed to be having a great time!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for St Patrick's Day. No food specials, no drink specials. When I asked the server why there were no drink specials she said 'people will come anyways'- I should have left on that note.  But gullible me stayed on the promise of Irish music and entertainment.  Just because U2 is from Ireland doesn't mean they play Irish music.  The Irish entertainment was some bagpipers for about twenty minutes and some girls dancing for thirty.  It was a very sterilized atmosphere... Not a party.  Do yourself a favor and go downtown next St Patrick's Day, they will show their appreciation for your business."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken wings! Awesome beer selection! Great place to catch a flames game. Service wasn't the best but wasn't bad either. Definitely worth checking if you like Irish pubs!"}
{"text":"Who can say no to a pub? Especially an Irish one?
Came down here for a friend's cousin's 40th. There was a room booked for the party, so it was nice a private. Hotter than the hinges of hell, but nice to have our own area. Still able to move around and socialize. The drinks were decently priced, and lots of responsible consumption was done. Had a blast. 
Quick story: I was actually at this pub about 12 years ago, on a whim, with a couple other people. What a blast! That's two times I've been here, and have had nothing but fun!"}
{"text":"Good ol' Limericks. The pub that I would consider a recurring south haunt for me and my group of friends. It's been around for as long as I can remember, and I do believe that this is where I got my first legitimate 18 year old \"no fake ID, no sir-eee\" drink-on.

Its a love and hate relationship with Limericks. With much recollection, the hit and miss has always been with my friends, who often find themselves disappointed over food and service, but never the beer. I myself have never been disappointed with Limerick's beer menu. Usually at other pubs, my introverted taste buds tend to cling to the trusty pint of Keiths, but at Limericks I never hesitate to try something new or revisit old favorites. I'm going to suggest this place as \"NOT good for dancing\" because once you have a pint of their hoegaarden on tap, you'll want another one and another, until your involuntarily dancing like a marionette doll with strings all bundled up

I used to find Limerick's menu boring and typical. But for the past year I have really enjoyed Limerick's specials menu. Their boxty pancakes served with veggies is one of the greatest beer partner meals I've ever had! It comes in three different fillings and I always get the chicken with leeks with cream and the corned beef with dijon cream. When I partner this dish with a nice irish ale, fruit/wheat beer, or guinness, I'm relegated into a serene STFU mode. 

Great summer patio overlooking the MacLoed Trail. Limericks is also equipped for sports events, but is no different in stiffing the common peasant for cover-charge when it comes to fight events :("}
{"text":"After our morning session at work, Limericks was another place that caught my eye last night due to its rooftop patio, lite up signs, etc.  In the morning this place can be easily missed if you're not keeping your eyes out. HOwever long story short! the interior, like most pubs, is dim, but does not lack the interior warmth.  Our party of 3 took advantage of their enormous rooftop patio, thankfully we didn't come here a week prior or else we would have been snowed on!
For the most part the only DRAWBACK to this place was the service! though we came here well after prime lunch time, the service was slow.  
For drinks, I ordered their local beer; Big Rock Ale which was light, and hearty with a lemon to top it off.  HOwever for the works, based on their menu, I decided to try one of their pub favorites Yorkshire Tidbit; with mushrooms, veggie, angus beef, and gravy! WIth a bit of a wait, in the end it was worth it.  The presentation, taste, and portions were worth every penny! This dish was an easy 4.5!!"}
{"text":"This place has horrible service. The serving staff rolls their eyes and the wait for food is horrendous. I thought it was a one-off but after the second occurrence I won't be returning for at least a few months."}
{"text":"Food is ok if you don't mind waiting for a very long time and the service tonight was horrendous! Server really was never around. Would recommend this place at all. Want good service....go to Hudson's"}
{"text":"Awesome patio, plenty of cozy booths, excellent pub atmosphere, but...

Been here twice, and service is so-so. The first visit was late at night after a concert, and we were ignored for about 30 minutes. Had the 3 cent ribs special this most recent visit, and they were nothing special. Hard and dry, but can't expect much more for that money. The beers were cold, and the patio was sunny and breezy.

Keep your expectations low when you go here, and you won't be too disappointed."}
{"text":"They have daily specials. Weekends are $6.50 breakfast and Eggs Ben, Thursdays are $5 for 5oz steak sandwich, $7 for 7 oz and $9 for 10 oz and half price wine. The wing night I wasnt so crazy about, 1cent wings but it was oily lacked flavour altogether. Decent place to hang out, servers are friendly."}
{"text":"3 cents ribs and very lively.  been there several times and generally enjoy better than your average pub.  Parking is not always easy"}
{"text":"This is a fine Irish like pub and restaurant on Macleod Trail.  It has been delightful weather wise and I can see how this fine pub could be an attraction for patio seekers.

The fine Irish pub is decked out in usual pub accoutrements, nice long bar, chrome details, old Irish beer bottles, books, tin cans and ceramic jugs.  There are family crests and mirrored beer propaganda lining the darker walls.  And the stained glass sconces give the seating areas that cozy bar feeling.

The most amazing thing about this place however is the food, I ordered a steak sandwich medium rare and a large Cesar and both were done to perfection.  The steak nice and grizzly on the outside and red and juicy on the inside, the Caesar salad, with the perfect combination of lemon meets garlic meets parmesan cheese.

The apps in this place are out of this world, my recommendation to you is to come here with a group of friends, check out a hockey game, have beer and choose from a selection of the following amazing appetizers: Baked Danish Brie with honey mango chunks, Baby stuffed Yorkshire pudding with shaved beef and horseradish, Lemon pepper Calamari, Atlantic PEI Mussels in white wine, Bacon wrapped Scallops in whiskey and maple syrup!  And this is only a quarter of the appy menu.

So yes pleasantly surprised, amazing food, good strong service from waitress. I will return!"}
{"text":"What's there to say about Limericks? Well, it's pretty much your standard North American \"Irish\" Pub. It reminds me a lot of the Kilkenny actually. If I'm not mistaken, they're under the same ownership (along with Dixon's, Donegal, Joyce and Seanachie). 

I've been to Limericks many times for a pint with friends or after a frisbee game. My favourite things to eat here are the Wild Boar burger and the mini yorkshire puddings. 

What I didn't know about Limerick's was just how big this space really is! I've always sat in one of the nooks and crannies on the main floor. But the last time I was there, I was introduced to the great beyond, the upstairs. There is so much more room up there. I particularly loved the private booths along the south wall. I counted 4 of them from where I sat. What a perfectly intimate setting to take your date if you want to be able to hear each other speak, but still want to just hit the pub. Each booth had it's own TV screen too. Fancy! 

If you don't get your own TV screen, have no fear. You can see one from just about any angle."}
{"text":"Limericks is a good n decent place to come hang out with friends and enjoy a nice pint of select brew and maybe a bite or two. Very decent selection of drinks and a menu that has a wide variety of the classic pub fare and a few little curve balls as well.

The inside certainly has the classic pub feel down, and on weekends is a lively and usually not super noisy so conversation is usually on the menu. Though their was one time i came and they had the volume at 11 ??? weird! but that was only time. (cmon it aint supposed to be a club??? hahaha) and if I think its loud, trust me its LOUD! I actually prefer to sit outside on the patio in the summer time anyway.

So the food here is ok, some of the items like the \"boxty\"and the traditional meat and or fish pies seem pretty well executed, however some of the other items like the burgers I have found to be a bit iffy on certain days, one time i got the mushroom burger and it was a disaster! stale bread, soggy cold mushrooms and mealy tomato! YUCK! but that was only one time, all other times it was a good decent pub burger.  On my most recent visit I got the \"philly\" cheesteak, and it resembled more of a pre dipped beef dip with a little melted provolone (could not even taste the cheese) and it was ok, but it was not a cheesteak!(i wont be getting it here anymore!) either way I usually don't expect the best food when I come to these \"chain\" pubs with different names, but its always nice to have something at a pub that goes a little beyond expectations

Service is perfectly fine, just what you would expect.Limericks has been open for quite some time now so they obviously are doing most things pretty well, Its a good place to come when you just feel like you want to go to a \"faux\" irish pub! come try it out if you havent already!"}
{"text":"Most of the service has been great, however it only takes one bad experience to change a perspective. The server made an issue and refused to split one bill into three separate bills as well as charged us for wings that were sent back to the kitchen.  I ended up paying for everyones meal including the servers ordering mistake.  Then, the server did not bring back the five dollars in change. I guess she was expecting a tip for her brilliant customer service.  I called to speak to the supervisor that defended her server without offering an apology or any corrective future action to satisfy an upset guest. Thank-you for sticking us with wings that your staff probably ate and rewarding your servers by letting them keep our change as a mandatory gratuity!"}
{"text":"I really like that Limericks feels old and well used.  And not in a trashy way.  The atmosphere is great.  I do find it a bit loud on big sports game days and there might be a slight TV overload, but aside from that, any pub that serves raspberry ale gets two thumbs up from me.

Our table was helped by a \"sick as a dog\" server last night and I'd strongly encourage management to ensure that staff who are sick stay home.  I really don't appreciate someone who is germy and gross manhandling my orders."}
{"text":"Wow.  That was well... horrific.  I actually like Limericks, but I'm going to stick to breakfasts from hereon.

As per my previous review. I usually come here for breakfast after dragon boat training with my team.  It's a great inexpensive breakfast, and I enjoy it immensely.

Buuut... I've never really done dinner here until tonight, and yeesh, I'm so regretting that decision.

Sunday is BOGO night for wings, ribs and appys.  Sooo, my friends and I ordered the white wine and marinara mussels, dry ribs in honey garlic and BBQ sauce, and chicken wings in both salt and pepper and jamaican jerk.

Let's break this down...

Mussels in White Wine sauce... that was probably the most dreadful mussels I've ever had.  The white wine sauce did not taste of any wine, and the alcohol wasn't boiled off in the slightest.  At least 1/4 of the mussels were dead pre-cooking, and there was an intense after taste of alcohol, not wine, I mean alcohol.  Fortunately, by draining the remaining fresh mussels, it almost tolerable.  It would have been tolerable but all of the remaining edible mussels were also overcooked.  Oh, and the loaf of bread given to soak up the sauce, was stale.  Of this dish, I would say that the whipped butter for the bread was the best thing there/

Mussels in Marinara sauce... it was edible but really nothing to write home about.  Again, quite a number of mussels were dead and inedible.  Again, the loaf of bread was quite stale.  

The chicken wings - salt and pepper. decent and edible.  Probably the only dish that was well cooked.

The Jamaican jerk chicken wings.  Ok, what the hell was that?  I don't know what the hell the cook thought it may be, but that was honestly miserable.  seemingly comprised entirely of chicken wings doused in vinegar and peppercorns only, I actually found this to be even unpleasant as the vinegar taste was overwhelming.  Only by dipping it into the honey garlic marinade for one of the orders of ribs did it ever get to be some level of edible.

The dry ribs with Honey Garlic - passable and ok.  

The dry ribs with the BBQ sauce - again, nothing to write home about.  Just sweet with an alcohol aftertaste.

Needless to say, it was edible but not necessarily a particularly fun meal as it was just memorable in it's mediocrity.  The only thing I can really say is that our server Tamara, was at least doing a decent job as she was attentive but not too much so, seemed interested in her section guests, and knew what she was doing without being forceful.  Add the fact that she's pretty cute, and at least someone earned the tip I left anyways."}
{"text":"This bar is really overrated.  It's really only good for larger groups trying to get together to watch a hockey game.  Because this place is so big you lose that quaintness of an Irish pub."}
{"text":"I love Limericks, its perfect for small or big groups. Beware, its ALWAYS busy, always, so if you have a big group head in early to save yourself a table. 

The food is excellent, the wings are THE BEST IN CALGARY! Pretty much any order off the menu will leave you happy!

The drinks are average priced, and they usually have great deals on beer. 

The servers are always so nice, sometimes slow, but you would be too if you had 10 tables of drunk people going at once!! And be nice if you have a giant table, tell them ahead of time that you want the bill split, its at lot easier to do in the beginning!"}
{"text":"So, I don't expect Irish pubs to vary that much from place-to-place, but Limericks isn't up there as my favourite one.

I do enjoy the layout of the place with its large fireplaces and big tables.  If you're looking to bring a large group of people, they can accommodate you with ample seating.  I like that everything in the place is wooden, including a lot of the decorations.  Obviously they have an abundance of sports paraphernalia everywhere, to satisfy the sports fans in the pub.

The only thing I'm not a fan of are the staff.  They don't seem to be the friendliest of people out there.  I realize they are all super good looking, but that doesn't mean they have to be snotty and snubby.  I've never had a good waitress experience at Limericks, which is why it isn't my favourite place.

Because of the quality of service, I choose other Irish pubs over this one.  Perhaps they could get some hot, nice people to work here instead of the hot, stuck-up ones they already have."}
{"text":"Lots of big screens for watching the game here. Check out calgarysbestpubs.com. Limericks is part of a pub chain with identical (and excellent) selection."}
{"text":"Ate at this Irish-style pub with my wife and grown daughter.  The service was slow but we weren't in a hurry.  Our wait staff was helpful and friendly and offered us good service.  I had the shepherds pie and my wife and daughter both had meat pies. The food was hot and tasty and the environment was comfortable. We will return."}
{"text":"Limericks is a great place to gather with friends for wings and a beer.  Typical pub atmosphere with a nice selection of beers.  On and off again service, but overall its been a positive experience there."}
