{"text":"We came because someone recommended the food to us. While the wings were really good, I couldn't enjoy my meal because this place is such a dump. It was filthy and cramped with boxes of frozen fries piled up on the floor. The walls and ceiling had what looked like years worth of grease on them. Everything needs a serious scrubbing and a fresh coat of paint. If they're too lazy to keep the area that customers order and eat in clean then you have to ask yourself what the areas we don't get to see are like. There are better BBQ places in the area where you won't get grossed out."}
{"text":"Best place in town to get ribs by far! Will definitely be ordering again for the Super Bowl. Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"Some of the best BBQ food you can get around town with reasonable prices. The atmosphere inside is friendly and fun, with a helpful and nice staff. See the food being prepared as soon as you walk in."}
{"text":"OMG we have had ribs all around the USA and these are most likely the BEST we have ever had by far"}
{"text":"We came here since we were in the area and we have had big bone bbq before in markham. However the wings were dry and fries were overcooked."}
{"text":"Great food! Been there maybe 10x but i never got a chance to try the cornbread because its always gone"}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for the most amazing pulled pork and southern rub style ribs.. this THE place.   Don't let the environment deter you from going it's worth it."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent place to share platters with a bunch of your friends. Workers are friendly and it is a positive environment. A bit pricey, but nice place to eat. Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Restaurant-When we first drove up we were very skeptical. Looks like a run down scary place.
We went inside and decided to stay. The seating area is simple, small, they cleaned a table right away for us. You may find that the smoke starts to burn your eyes after a bit they need better ventilation in there. Bathrooms, if you can hold it do so I did. Most people come to order out. If you stay prepare to smell like BBQ everything from head to toe. 

Employees-Cooks, Waitstaff super nice, friendly, attentive, made all the difference.

Food- meat/ribs/wings/pulled pork fantastic, seasoned, cooked well, not greasy, good portions, I am very finicky with meats I can tell right away if it isn't cured, cleaned, seasoned properly. They did an A+ job.
Wish the Corn bread was fresher or maybe warmer. But was still good. Beans, slaw and fries were good as well. 

Cost- very fair and affordable for the quality you are getting.

Giving it 4 and not 5 because the establishment needs a good facelift/cleaning.

Will do take out here from now on. Best place We have found for Authentic BBQ thus far. Try it you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"This place is the closest thing to the southern rib experience in Toronto. The building is from a more simpler time... but the ribs are excellent. Just be ready to wait a bit for your food... the price of popularity. 

They have some free parking as well and the restrooms are clean."}
{"text":"Food is good. Has that soul food southern comfort taste. I've only eaten here once so can't tell you if it's consistent. Only problem I have is and only reason I gave it two stars is... Well they need to get the flies out of there asap. Having a bunch of flies wizzing around your head while eating is messed up. Makes me think if there sitting on the food, laying eggs in there who knows. Bottom line is Memphis get rid of the flies and keep a cleaner work area. I won't eat here again unless it's more clean. Many more southern style places to choose from :) just my honest opinion."}
{"text":"This place is the definition of a dive.  Driving by, it kind of looks like a shack, and inside isn't too pretty either.  However WHO CARES because the bbq is so damn good here it has now taken over what will be my new go-to bbq place (to replace the sadly closed and amazing Paul and Sandy's).

The pulled pork is heaven and perfectly seasoned and moist. I usually never rave about fries, but the fries here are the perfect crispiness and SO DAMN GOOD. I could eat these fries forever.  Next time I really want to try the angus burger because my friend had it and it looked absolutely amazing. 

It's a fair bit of a drive up Islington into Woodbridge for me but this place justifies it.  Will be back, hopefully soon."}
{"text":"I ordered food an hour in advance for pick up. When I arrived, I still had to wait another 45 minutes for my food, and they still didn't get it right.

I ordered the Elvis platter, which was not that good. They forgot to include the cornbread. The ribs were dry, and the creamy parmesan chicken wings were partially sauced and weren't impressive at all. The best part was the pulled pork, which was pretty bland compared to R&D's in Brampton. 

I would not go here again, and wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Try R&D's instead."}
{"text":"We had a great experience ordering for pickup from here about a month ago, and I can't wait to go back for both the ribs and wings. They were fabulous. The smoked wings are really great and that is why a pound of wings, shared, is just not enough. I was surprised that I'd be as crazy about the wings at a BBQ joint as the ribs; but the moist, smoked, tender and flavourful wings are first on my priority list for next time. Ribs had great texture and taste.

I look forward to trying everything and more again and I hope the next time the pulled pork isn't quite as salty and wish the fries weren't breaded (the only things making the 5 star a touch shaky). The baked beans are fabulous too.

Friendly staff and a true roadside feel round out the experience. I had to write this one down before I forget to do it!"}
{"text":"Everything Wayne C said above, I agree with 110 % .

This place is one of the biggest surprises in Toronto area dining, with fantastic service and a great, small dining area to add to the atmosphere.

The smoked wings are phenomenal, and like nothing I've ever taste. My better half raved about the BBQ Brisket and the ribs, with original sauce, were stellar.

I would highly recommend Memphis BBQ. They were sold out of the pulled pork, but that's ok. It's a great reason for us to go back for another visit.

Don't miss it !"}
{"text":"I laughed at the review below done by \"guy fieri\".   It's so true....this place would make DD&D any day.


AWESOME ribs - possibly the best north of the US border."}
{"text":"These guys deliver excellent wings at an affordable price. Worth the many long trips to eat here. I once convinced a few mates to trek down here. Sadly when we got inside we were told the kitchen was  closed. However buddy fired the grill back on and made us those juicy wings. He saved us from a bitter disappointment. Tip: the fries are actually very good too!"}
{"text":"Ribs is to DIE for. Amazing food. My bf and I did take out and it took about 40 mins but totally worth it!!"}
{"text":"The place is a dive and is literally in the middle of nowhere, however, the ribs and pulled pork are absolutely delicious. I highly recommend getting their hot BBQ sauce on the side as it adds another level of zip to the brilliantly spiced ribs."}
{"text":"Delicious BBQ! Great food at a great price. The place is tight though so you may want to just go for take out here."}
{"text":"Memphis BBQ is not a place to take a date.  Unless you don't plan to have a 2nd date.  This is a complete hole in the wall, dive restaurant, with great food!  Ordered the Elvis platter, as I was unsure of what I should order.  This provides enough food to feed 2 people....easily.  Four ribs, 4 wings, pulled pork, french fries, corn bread, coleslaw, & baked beans.  I could barely get through half of the food, and it was delicious!  I would go back again for the ribs, hands down, any day.  In fact, I will likely go there for some take out this weekend.  The staff are really friendly, and the only thing that could possibly make this better would be if they served alcohol, and I could have downed a very nice cold beer with my ribs and wings, and pork, and ahh... so much food!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Where do you eat after being drained from an intense workout?  Memphis BBQ that's where!

Had a little trouble looking for this joint since it is off to the corner of a tiny plaza.  Parking is tough but then again I'm Asian :( .

As soon as you step in you are greeted with a friendly waitress who knows you're hungry and ready to wolf down lbs of meat!

With all the raving about their famous Elvis platter it was a no brainer.  After a 15 min wait, which felt like a lifetime of fasting, our platters sat in front of our faces and we didn't wasted time to dig in.  Platter was huge!! Chicken wing, pulled pork, ribs, fries, beans, corn bread!!! Every thing tasted amazing! Took me a good 30 min to clean the plate but I had to leave some of the fries and half the corn bread behind; the platter was too monstrous!

Overall, I'd say Memphis deserve a high 4 but given the size of the joint it hindered the dine in experience a little.  Make no mistake though, I left Memphis satisfied and almost fell into a food coma!"}
{"text":"This place is dangerous!  We drive 30-40 from midtown Toronto to get here.  It looks like a hole in the wall, and if I didn't know about the great food I'd just drive right past it.  Yesterday we decided to get their amazing ribs and while we're at it ordered some chicken wings with the dry rub cajun spices. OMG!!!! We devoured the wings in the car on our way home!!! Living in Toronto there are so many wing places that are close to home BUT we have never had wings this good! Seriously! They had a crunch to them and were moist at the same time.  To die for!! You must get the wings and eat them while they are hot.   You will not regret it :)"}
{"text":"Smoke is the single greatest ingredient and this place is by far the best smokehouse around.  I've been to many places around rural redneck America that don't even come close to how good this place is.  The ribs are perfection and so are the smoked chicken wings.  Even the homemade sauces blow any high end shelf bought sauces out of the water.  I recommend this place to anyone and everyone and if yelp provides a 6th star I would select it for Memphis BBQ."}
{"text":"Great BBQ place. It's a small restaurant. When you walk in you immediately see the front desk with the grill behind it, there's also a couple of bar chairs facing the window. There's another room in the back where you can sit an eat, but it has a bit of a cramped feel to it. 

The staff was very friendly and welcoming. We were greeted with a friendly smile as soon as we walked through the door. They were also very quick making the food and serving it. 

The food was pretty good too, very flavorful. We got a burger and a pulled pork sandwich. The burger tasted like the kind I get from the grocery store, but it was still good. The pulled pork was really flavorful and had a lot of sauce on it. The fries were also pretty crunchy.

A decent place if you're in the mood for BBQ."}
{"text":"It's literally a dive. But when you actually eat one of their pulled pork sandwiches... you instantly end up in heaven. I can probably comfortably say that pulled pork sandwich was easily tops Ribfest pulled pork, which says something. Don't judge a book by it's cover!"}
{"text":"Great service, but more importantly, great food. The ribs were delicious but I gotta say the brisket was what I enjoyed the most.

Thanks Yelp for helping me find this place"}
{"text":"I checked this place out (despite it being a 30 min drive from my house) due to the glowing reviews on this site and Blog T.O.   We got the take out combo #3, which was definitely enough for 4 people (plenty of leftovers).  I suggest paying the extra $20 for the #5 combo, since you get an extra rack and 2 lbs of pulled pork.  The wait was a bit longer than we expected, considering we called in the order 3 hrs in advance and then had to wait for 15 mins once we arrived (the waiting area is pretty cramped).  Though I guess it ensures that the order was fresh when we picked it up (they didn't start prepping the order until after we had arrived).  

Great cornbread, slaw and beans. Decent fries (eat them fast or they get soggy in the takeout container). Good wings, good ribs (though I didn't like that they were pre-cut). The ribs are actually huge, I don't know if I've seen pork ribs of that size before.  The rib sauce didn't do much for anybody in our group.  

It was good, but it isn't worth the drive from downtown.  But if you live close by and you love BBQ, go have a look."}
{"text":"The ribs served at this place is amazing. Just a heads up there is not a lot of place to sit. I recommend getting the Elvis Plate to go if this is your first time here. Very friend staff at this location."}
{"text":"Great ribs n wings! We usually order extras to take home."}
{"text":"Driving past, you'd think this place is a real hole. And it is. Place is small and kind of dingy. The food though, is excellent! There are some tables but I never feel like staying. Great take out place for meat! I'm nearby so when the wife craves ribs, I just pop over and they get things done quick."}
{"text":"We got a rack of ribs and pound of wings to go. Delicious as always. One of the few cool spots in the Vaughan 'burbs."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in southern Ontario.  Elvis platter all damn day son!  So much food.  I recommend getting the smoked wings.  So tender and tasty."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service & amazing food! My go-to BBQ joint that NEVER disappoints. The ribs are juicy and tender. The wings are flavorful and cooked just right. The Monday special is amazing and filling!"}
{"text":"Awesome just Awesome, Go hungry and get the Elvis platter worth every penny and just finger licking good. The exterior of the building may seem a little down to some but ti only adds to the amazing experience of being in a southern BBQ shop."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Had the Elvis platter and it was more than enough for two people. The ribs were delicious. The pulled pork was great. The chicken wings were ok. I don't know what batter is used for the fries but it was really great. The place is small and cozy. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Amazing ribs and wings! Smokey, sweet and fall off the bone delicious. Tiny little eating area but cozy and full of happy customers. I went on a Monday and took advantage of their Monday mania special. Full rack of ribs and a pound of wings with large fries or salad for $25 tx included. So good, I'll be back for more!! Steady stream of takeout orders too!"}
{"text":"Most amazing BBQ place around pulled pork is amazing and there ribs are crazy if you go I'm telling you to order the ELVIS PLATER !"}
{"text":"Moneys worth!!! 

Come here for Monday special! You get 1 full rack of their delicious ribs, 1 lbs of their crispy wings (sauce on or the side) and a ton of fries. In my honest opinion, this special feeds 2 people to the fullest, if not three. 

The best genuine BBQ place ever! 

I recommend this to anyone and everyone, sucks that I live kinda far from this place. Otherwise.... I'd come here once a week (Mondays)! 

Enjoy"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely phenomenal. Signature BBQ chicken wings were perfectly crispy, the ribs fell off the bone and the fries were perfect. Got the half combo and I'm stuffed. Worth driving out there for it, limited space- consider takeout."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what took me so long to make it back up here but yo, this is like my 6th time coming to this spot & it has NEVER failed me. Not even once. The ribs & wings at Memphis are beyond phenomenal. I think of this place more like an experience than anything. You know like, when someone comes in town, and you don't wanna cook and all that, but you want them to feel elite but also not dip into your phone bill money? Yeah, this is the spot b. There's no other choice when it comes to ribs.. I gave it 5 stars cause to this day, I've been completely satisfied every single visit. So yeah, I suggest making your way out here soon so you can hit me up like, \"damn Bishop, you wasn't playing bro! That place is lit!\" 

-BB"}
{"text":"We have dined in and taken out!!
This place is awesome as is the food, we will be back again and again!
Keep up the great work guys!!"}
{"text":"Really nice ribs. Like really, really nice. Juicy, firm yet still fall off the bone. But not... fatty and mush. Definitely worth getting. Everything else?   Not so much. The wings are just frozen from whatever and tossed in house sauces (which are pretty good), the fries are mediocre and the brisket is shredded, leading me to believe they use a cheap cut. Come for the ribs, leave for just about everything else. Nice guys behind the counter though!"}
{"text":"Smoked wings are great; fall off the bone.  Chicken sandwich also very good and grilled to perfection; not dry.  Sides are average(coleslaw, corn bread & beans).  Fries & onion rings were excellent also.
Place has personality and looks like a place which would have great BBQ."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall type bbq house
GREAT PEOPLE 
Good wings
AMAZING RIBS
Really good pulled pork
Awesome prices!

The epitomy of bang for your buck. Just wished they served alcohol!

Highly recommended!
That is all!"}
{"text":"Amazing food at an amazing value... I would give it 5 stars but the dining room is a hole in the wall. Ribs are fall off the bone, and these wings, forget the name, are mouth watering. Onions rings are huge. Portion sizes are amazing and you can feed 4 hungry guys at a very very  reasonable value."}
{"text":"I'm from the south. I live in Mississippi and eat in Memphis once a month or more. 

The ribs are good. Leave the sauce off and eat them dry. They have a good bark and smoke ring. 

With the sauce, they are more of a St. Louis rib. Not bad. But, better dry. 

Atmosphere is a delta juke joint vibe. Good folks behind the counter. I'll go back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"If you're a fan of all the Rib Fests we've had all over the GTA, and you miss greasing up your face with mouth-watering baby backs, then make sure you step into this little joint in Woodbridge! You'll think you're still at your favourite Rib Fest. 

Bottom line: the ribs are excellent. The BBQ is delicious, the meat is cooked perfectly with the right amount of bite vs tenderness (it should not completely fall off the bone! Don't listen to that marketing crap). The chicken wings are great as well. The place isn't large so dining in may be tricky. We just order take out whenever we're driving by. 

Memphis BBQ does it right, and for a minute there I almost forgot I was in Canada."}
{"text":"I came here because my brother recommended it. From the outside this place doesn't look like much, but don't let that stop you from going in. The food is very good and a great price. Everyone that went with me was very happy with their food (that included 2 kids 12+11 years old). I would come back again. The service was great!! They check in with you often, the cook even came by to say hi and see if we liked the food."}
{"text":"My friend and I were in the area for a movie and we found Memphis BBQ but accident. As we both enjoy BBQ we decided to try it out. Had the patter to get a feel for everything.

Brisket is excellent. Nice and smokey with a good fat content to it. The Pulled pork was good too. We when the way of the wet BBQ and the ribs were good. The Beef tips were amazing though - really enjoyed them. The Corn beard was nice and moist - very enjoyable.

The chicken - meh. Take it or leave it.  The onion rings were a disappointment but i do miss the onion rings of hwy 61.

Overall I would recommend the restaurant."}
{"text":"Arrived here on a busy Friday night. Place was crowded and it was a long wait for a table, but I had a craving for BBQ and was super hungry so we waited. I ordered the Elvis platter and my dining companion ordered the big boy combo. I really enjoyed the pulled pork and smoked wings, they were the highlight of my meal. My ribs were on the dry side but I doused them in sauce to compensate. The beans and coleslaw were just okay and I'm not sure what happened to the cornbread, it was not included and we weren't advised. My dining companion's ribs were moist and succulent and he loved the crispy wings and fries, as did I. The service was super friendly and overall it was a good dining experience, the wait for a table and food is long but given the fact they only have a few tables and a lot of customers it's to be expected. Would we come back? Yes, it definitely warrants another visit."}
{"text":"Memphis is GOAT and I'm sad because I didn't come on Monday to get their 20$ special but I got the Elvis platter and big boy...pulled pork, ribs fries on point...wings were great too...I want BBQ in my dreams"}
{"text":"A small smokey shack at the bend in the road. They do takeout, they do dine in, and they do BBQ right. Their BBQ ribs are stellar and perfectly smoked. The meat is almost fall off the bone. It has just enough tenderness to keep the meat together. Best place to go to when you got the craving for southern style BBQ done right. The trophies on their wall prove it."}
{"text":"Alright this is what it is. This place has the best wings, period. Signature smoked wings fall of the bone oh my gosh. I'm from out of town but anytime I'm in Woodbridge I meet up with some friends at this spot. Just copped 4lbs from there gunna put two lbs off the bone into a Mac and cheese casserole on god. They got ribs too. Jesus just go here. And everyone is so nice and thankful. Small place so try going on off-meal times but if you can't it's worth all the wait."}
{"text":"Hands down best ribs, best wings and the fries are to die for. Cornbread is fresh soft and sweet!! Their burgers are also very good. My son absolutely loves the ribs here!!! This is our go to place for ribs and wings. Get there before the dinner rush because it can get very busy. I would suggest calling in your order because there isn't much room to wait and the parking lot is small and always packed!"}
{"text":"Memphis BBQ is a pleasent surpise in the middle of a residental area you will find a small cozy diner.  The decor is unique with lots of funny posters and such.  The chairs are like rocking chairs and feels like it can break anytime soon.  There are only 6 tables in the dining area. So yes it is super tiny.

Now to the food!! O-M-G Amazing pulled pork, wings and ribssss.  Yes I got all that in one platter - I got the Elvis Platter.  Came with a 4 ribs, 4 wings and some pulled pork as well as fries, colesaw and beans.  All that for $19 wow what a deal.  I can't wait to go back for more BBQ next time I am in the area. Highly recommeded for the food.

{"text":"Welcome to Graceland North! I just donned my sequined-tassel coat, put my over sized shades on, shimmied my way into a white jumpsuit and curled my lip so I could be in the perfect character to say.... \"Thank ya...thank ya vury much\" to Memphis BBQ.

As I mentioned in my earlier tip about this spot, don't let the roadside look of this place turn you off. It may not look like much but what have we learned time and time again about books and their covers??? 

You in the back.....that's right: \"Stop being a judgmental jerk, pull over, get out of your car and GET INSIDE MEMPHIS BBQ... NOW!!!\" 

Walking in they have an active open kitchen ready for your take-away orders. Skilled master of the grill and fryers whipping up your sides and burgers and taking orders so you and grab and go without being judged on how much food you just bought. 

Myself on the other hand, I feel no shame in public displays of affection or gluttony and thank god because I'm pretty sure I displayed both excessively today (and was noisy about it) while enjoying my meal. (Ask me if I care or was embarrassed? Ask me!)

Nope.

And F^&*K me what a meal! What did I order? Well hold on a slow cooked second amigo and let me tell you. After getting lost in the menu like that of the eyes of ones beloved I had to refer to my servers expertise. She knew the score right away as I looked at her with my \"help me I'm hungry\" eyes, which I'm sure she had seen once or twice before. 

Being indecisive, my server was on point with her recommendation. She had me order the Elvis platter which came complete with 1/2 pound of slow cooked pulled pork, 4 bones of sloowwwwwww cooked ribs, a slice of corn bread, a pile O fries, baked beans, and coleslaw. 

Oh wait I almost forgot to mention, with that King of platters you also get a 1/2 pound of the BBQ smoked wings (not to be confused with standard wings). BBQ smoked wings never see a deep fryer, they cook slow for 24 hours on low before being cooked for an additional 4 hours. YEP - that just happened, I messed myself in more ways than one. 

Everything was cooked better than I could have imagined in my wildest dreams, fall off the bone tender, perfect marriage of sauce and flavour on each item. Sorry KFC but this place is the TRUE definition of finger-licking-good, I didn't even bother with a wet nap. 

I'm more than excited to brag about this place and I encourage NAY recommend NAY strongly encourage you to give this place a try. However if you happen to have the last seat and I show up you best move over...or we're going to have words.

3 Ribs for Memphis BBQ...RIB RIB Hooray, RIB RIB Hooray, RIB RIB Hooray!"}
{"text":"Had a hankering for Some BBQ and was in the area so decided to give Memphis BBQ a try. I had the mini combo which comes with 3 bones, 1/2 pound of ribs, fries, cornbread, baked beans, and coleslaw. The ribs were the best offering of the combo. The wings were run of the mill frozen wings, the beans and slaw were ok, and the fries were sub par, being the frozen bag type with a coating to make them crispy. Lots of food for your buck but not really the best quality. Oh and the cornbread wasn't the best either, cut off a loaf and served cold. Ok for a fill up but not really anything to write home about."}
{"text":"An amazing place to stop by if you are in the area. Homstyle BBQ that really hits the spot."}
{"text":"Really good BBQ!

Was feeling the winter blues and I need my carnivore fix, so decided to hit up this little place tucked away on Islington Ave.

The service was fantastic - the owners family themselves work there, and its really hard to top customer service delivered right from the owners of any business.

I ordered the Pulled Pork platter. Since it was my first time there and I wanted to try their brisket too, the owner hooked me up with half portions of each - PP and BB. He also gave me a couple rib bones - ON THE HOUSE! What a nice guy! 

PS: My acceptance of their ribs has not compromised my independence in writing this review.

The BB and PP were good, but man, the ribs were UNREAL! Should have got those as the focal point of my meal instead!

They give you a wide variety of sides as well. I was not a big fan of their cornbread, but the coleslaw and beans are good. Their fries are tasty as well. 

Will def. be going back and this time around, I will be getting my meal featured around the ribs!"}
{"text":"Always excellent food and customer service! I haven't tried anything that I didn't like and the portions sizes are amazing for the price. I would and have recommended Memphis to many people looking for a nice little spot to enjoy a great meal."}

I have now proven wrong when my in-laws took me to this hole in a wall kinda place! Yes, I cant get enough of this place!! Everytime I think of Toronto, I automatically drool and think of Memphis BBQ. Ivan Pavlov will be happy how this place became my classical conditioning of BBQ!

This place is the bomb!  Hope they keep up the consistency!"}
{"text":"Visited this place after seeing it on TV. Ribs were dry, and should of been falling off the bone. Side dishes were Ok but not what I went for.  Wouldn't go back and all friends who came along agreed."}
{"text":"I've been going to Memphis BBQ for maybe three years and I love it each time. I usually order the pulled pork sandwich, which is juicy and delicious. Also, the smoked wings are sooooo good. Both these dishes come with fries which taste like Costco fries. It's a small place so there's often a wait to be seated as there's approx. 6 tables and each table sits only 4 people so sometimes take out is the best option. The staff are always friendly and welcoming. 
Cash and debit only."}
{"text":"This is really good BBQ. I'm always on the hunt for great BBQ, as its one of my favorite foods. 

Got  the big bone combo. 6 ribs, pound of wings (8 wings), fries, baked beans and cornbread all for $20. Its a very reasonable price, and a lot of food (I shared it with the wife). The meat was delicious. I wasn't a huge fan of the cornbread or the fries, but the meat more than made up for it. 

Cash or debit. 
Big parking lot
Will return!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ take out I've ever had. Sure the wait can be a while, but they cook the food fresh for you. We got ribs and pulled pork and it was sooooo juicy and delicious. Decent prices too! Do highly recommend if you love BBQ!"}
{"text":"Daaaaaaamn!!
All of the ranting and raving over this place is not exaggerated. The ribs are that good!

I knew we were in good shape as soon as I drove up to the place and saw what a dive it is. I'm firmly convinced that barbecue should only be eaten in a place that looks like it might fall down, in a neighborhood that's suspect, and bonus points if there is some sort of cartoon pig involved! 

The french fries are very VERY sad, frankly they are an insult to the rest of the dinner and should never be put on a plate, likewise the slices of dry, bland cornbread loaf, the onion rings are pedestrian, frozen and prefab, but acceptable, the creamy style coleslaw is solid, the pit Style beans are truly outstanding, tender and definitely freshly-made, but the ribs, oh Lord the ribs! 

Anyone who knows BBQ knows that ribs are not supposed to \"fall off the bone\", and they're not supposed to be boiled, or waterlogged and mushy, they're supposed to be tender and lightly smokey, with a nice caramelized crust of dry rub plus a little sauce finished over fire, and these ribs live up to the billing on all fronts!

And with a full rack of Memphis style side ribs plus all the trimmings coming in at only $22 bucks, you absolutely cannot go wrong! Just opt for the onion rings and not the ridiculous supermarket McCain crispy fries and you are good to go! 

Also, don't look like a rookie getting a pulled pork sandwich, or god forbid, a burger, get some ribs!
ENJOY!!"}
{"text":"Memphis BBQ is the place to go for southern food. Whether you want ribs, pulled pork, or deep fried wings, this place has it all. Additionally, all plates include a piece of cornbread, coleslaw, and sweet beans. The portions sizes are enormous here. Don't overestimate your eating abilities and check your ego at the door. A lot of seemingly big guys walk in with a bunch of \"swag\" and think they can conquer the Big Boi Platter, but end up getting demolished themselves and packing the remains for take out. The ribs seem to be the best choice here, even though there are multiple flavors for the wings. The wings can feel dry at times.

The decor of Memphis BBQ reflects an old Southern restaurant with plenty of vintage posters. There are only six tables in the restaurant, and it can get really cozy if all the tables are full. Although Memphis BBQ is far out of the city, it is still worth the trip for southern barbecued meat."}
{"text":"The food is awesome, however the ambiance and the service could be improved.

A little bit more seating room would be a welcomed addition - the decor is representative of a dive BBQ joint, which seems perfectly appropriate for the food menu.

The service could've been faster but the staff was very polite and accommodating.

All in all, a spot worth trying out - the food is truly very good and reminiscent of real southern BBQ restaurant."}
{"text":"Love this place! Be warned that the dine in area is small so its not for large groups"}
{"text":"Best ribs and wings I have ever had. Honestly for the cost of the amount and quality of food you get from this place it is amazing. Also the customer services is great as well, you are always greeted with a smile. It may be hard to find, however it is well worth your time"}
{"text":"Funny, even though this place is in the middle of Vaughn, you still sort've feel like you're arriving at an old roadside place since it's on a unique bend of the (Humber) river valley and the place itself is fairly 'rustic'.

I called ahead to try and make a reservation, but they don't take any; although he assured me we should be fine to take the two booths at the back. Once we arrived, a couple were finishing their meal, so our small group had to split up until they were done. A bit of an annoyance, and plan on the fact that it's small and they don't take reservations - well the two are related aren't they?

They staff were very friendly though, and took our order promptly. The food was terrific. The ribs were the star, being done perfectly and also VERY meaty - in fact probably the most meat on a rib that comes to memory. The wings were also terrific and a huge hit. Fries and rings were solid, with the cornbread just being ok. I would lean to 5 star review on these alone, but the pulled was just ok. Not the freshest, and the sauce almost tasted overcooked.

Still a lot more hits and misses, and I'm still thinking about the ribs and wings."}
{"text":"Toronto and BBQ have never made much sense to me until I went to Memphis BBQ just north of the YYZ airport. I have always associated Toronto with poutine and hockey, not BBQ. But after traveling through parts of the South, I can say these guys do it right. They have tender, juicy ribs and flavorful sauces and massive portions -- everything that I could want in a BBQ joint, even if it is in Toronto.

I tried the Elvis platter, which comes with a bit of everything: pulled pork, ribs, wing, fries, cornbread and a bit a coleslaw and beans. The ribs were smoky and flavorful, and not drenched in sauce so you can get a taste of that bbq'd-for-hours texture. Both the pulled pork and the wings paired nicely with their sauces - try hot creamsicle sauce for a nice blend of spicy and tangy. The sides were OK, but all things considered it's a great deal for $18. 

Be mindful of what time you come here, this place is small and can only seat maybe 25 people. If you have a large group during dinner you should order ahead and get take away. 

The bad: Americans beware, they did not take any of my American credit or debit cards!!! You must use cash. Luckily there is an ATM in the shop next door that will take your American debit cards. Also they do not serve one drop of alcohol. I love BBQ, I love beer, I love my BBQ with a cold beer and you can't get that here."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today and all I can say is wow! I got the elvis platter which had ribs,chicken wings, pulled pork plus it includes fries, coleslaw, beans and corn bread. Everything was made to perfection. The ribs were fall off the bone. The pulled pork was fantastic and they have a big selection of sauces for your wings. This was only around $18! The portions here are massive. I'm a really big eater and I barely finished. This is going to be my new goto place for my bbq fix. The only con about this place is that the dine-in area is really small."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this BBQ spot for years and it never seems to change. That's why I keep coming back, the service is great, food is even greater and the feel of the restaurant is much more cozier than you think. You gotta try the smoked wings!"}
{"text":"I come here as often as I can. They have The best ribs and wings you can find in the suburbs.  The hot honey flavoured wings are my favourite.  Ask for extra sauce for the ribs because it's incredible. The fries are also perfect.   I recommend calling  about an hour ahead if you want to order take out, as they are always crazy busy.  The parking lot is also rather small but people are always leaving."}
{"text":"I came, I saw and I almost conquered the amazing ribs.  I was out looking at houses when I stumbled upon this bungalow style ribs place.  It looks more like a take-out but I was excited to see it since I have read reviews about this place.  We had the Elvis platter which had fries, corn bread, coleslaw, pulled pork, wings and ribs all for $17.99!  It was huge and I am sad to say that we did not finish it all.  But I must say the ribs and the wings were amazingly flavourful and tender, with lots of meat to loll about in my happy mouth.  The sides were good and they complimented the meal well but for the value it was well worth the price.  I did have to roll myself out of there after that meal but will definitely go there again for a nice relaxed lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Love the place! Great wings/ribs
Always a load of friendly staff

It's a small place so be prepared to wait for a seat if you're dining in (its worth the wait)!"}
{"text":"This place is small and may not be luxurious but the service is good and best of all the food is excellent!! Absolutely amazing BBQ ribs, wings and pulled pork!! My favorite dish is king Elvish... You get 3 piece ribs, smoked wings and a big portion of pulled pork along with an order of fries!! All for just 20 bucks!! 

This restaurant is a must try!!"}
{"text":"Finished a round of golf close by and whaddaya know?  Yelp app comes up with this gem for me.

Got the Rib/Wing combo.  And it was delish.  The GTA sorely lacks great BBQ and this place is a hidden gem!  Only wish there was a bit more seating space, but that'd ruin the intimate affair.  Now during my next round of golf nearby, I'm going to be thinking about the food after the round."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! I visited Memphis BBQ because of the Yelp reviews. I love ribs and had to give it a try. It's one of those small dive places that just looks like it should have great BBQ, even though walking in you're asking yourself if you're in the right place. Memphis delivers! It may be the best BBQ I've ever had. Service was so friendly and helpful when asked if we'd ever been in before. They directed us towards sauces and platters that would be good for each of us depending on our preferences. 
As soon as you walk in you smell the smoker and I'm pretty sure I walked out smelling like BBQ but it was well worth it! I will definitely be ordering take out this summer to dine outside and feast with my family."}
{"text":"Amazing find before we left the city! We had the ribs, which were juicy, smoky and tender. Great flavour! Served with fries, coleslaw, baked beans and cornbread. All which were good. 
We also tried the world wings, we tries the signature BBQ sauce, loved the flavour and lightness of the sauce. We also tries the hot creamsicle. It's hot sauce mixed with creamy garlic. Yummy!! Would definitely go back when in the Toronto area."}
{"text":"Delicious food and amazing staff - so friendly and thoughtful. Very cute place. Also nice and warm on freezing cold days :)"}
{"text":"Pre-frozen wings
Pre-plastic packed ribs
I always thought everything was fresh but, one day I saw boxes of frozen wings on the floor, guys unwrapping cooked ribs to be reheated.

This place is nothing special. Ribs are usually slightly dry,
and those smoked wings I got that day was super dry too."}
{"text":"It's a small place you might just drive past, but wait for it! If you haven't stopped by and tried their food, why have you been waiting foso long? Amazing BBQ styled ribs & spicy chicken wings and wait don't forget the cornbread, Mmmm, the cornbread! 
Definitely recommending this place to everyone that loves American styled BBQ!"}
{"text":"Memphis does not dissapoint!Although it is a small place and the location is fairly remote the food is fantastic and the prices are reasonable!This place is famous for award-winning wings."}
{"text":"If Iived closer to Memphis BBQ I would be visiting much more frequently.  The place is smsll with only a few tables.. the staff are friendly and the wings are out of this world!"}
{"text":"Do you remember in House of Cards (the Netflix version) how Kevin Spacey's character eats the best ribs of the country in a small place that really doesn't look like much from the outside and how he literally and shamelessly porks out to the point of licking his fingers because the food is just so damn good? Well, this is the real life equivalent.

Let's be honest. You've seen the reviews. I'm not the first one to tell you the wings are awesome, the burger is tasty and the food is absolutely fantastic. So let me tell you about the staff. We arrived 15 minutes before they were closing and they welcomed us warmly, made us sit, took the kids' orders quickly so they could eat first, then proceeded to take our orders. The person that seemed to manage the operation was friendly and kind. The waitress had a nice smile (although she was probably tired after a long day's work) and her recommendations were exquisite. She never made us feel like we were in the middle of the way, although they did have to prep for closing. She was very considerate and checked on us often to see if we had everything we needed.

Yes, the food is awesome. My 7-year old wolfed down her burger to the point where I was wondering if she was going to eat another one. My 5-year old loved the BBQ sauce so much she drowned her fries in it. A 5-year old liking BBQ sauce! I never thought I would see it, but good food is a universal language. However, what made this one of the best dining experience for my family is the fact that the great food was supplemented by the most hospitable service. They could have told us they were closing. Instead, they treated us like we were guests in their own homes. This is truly what makes this place special."}
{"text":"On Sunday we stopped by for some wings and ribs.  The three of us ordered the Elvis Platter with their signature BBQ sauce.  The second was the Big Boy with wings and ribs with their medium sauce.  

The wings and ribs were great.  The pulled pork was done to perfection.  The fries and onion rings were hot and good.  

As I told the server it was an excellent meal.  The only disappointment was their potato bacon soup which we found out is not on the menu during the summer.  Both my wife and daughter love eating their corn bread with the soup as a starter.  No worries we will be back."}
{"text":"Always great food, friendly service. Go for the ribs, come back to try something else; trust me. Burgers and wings are amazing! Little dining area, open kitchen. Can call ahead for pickup orders."}
{"text":"Amazing bbq!  Great food and service from this small restaurant.  The ribs have great flavor and fall off the bone.  I also had the pulled pork which was rich with flavor."}
{"text":"If Guy Fieri came here he would say this:

This place is in the middle of NOWHERE in a town named Woodbridge, Ontario.  The building stands alone and if you don't hear from the locals, you'll never know this place exist.

The BBQ Ribs, pure MONEY with a well-balanced barbecue sauce and the meat is barely falling off the bone.

They have BBQ Smoked Chicken Wings which are OFF-THE-HOOK, with a smoke flavour that you can't get ANYWHERE ELSE.

The 3-Bone Rib Meal comes with Fries, Coleslaw, Beans, and Corn Bread that is enough to feed an ARMY.  The Meal cost $9.00 as if they are GIVING IT AWAY for free.

That's how we ROLL!  This place is OUT OF BOUNDS!

Well, in my own words I would have to say this place even looks like a BBQ Joint that Guy Fieri or Bobby Flay usually introduces in their shows.  If you didn't know you were in Woodbridge, you might think you are in Memphis USA I'm guessing(Never been to Memphis).

The interior is Memphis-themed with Wooden furniture as a BBQ Joint should have.  A couple televisions showing CP24 while I noticed the local highschoolers come by for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"This time I got the Big Boy and had a better experience than last time

The Big Boy comes with a half rack, 1/2 lb of wings, fries, coleslaw and beans which is really too much for one sitting but its a bonus being able to enjoy twice

The wings should not be ordered for take out especially with sauce on, they were soggy and average despite being tasty which is consistent with my impression of their wings from my previous ten years being an occasional patron of this place (never tried wings without having to drive them 10 minutes to my house)

The Ribs were much better than last time though two of the ribs were just so caked in fat you could not really enjoy them. It was way better than last time when every rib was an atrocity so I am happy...7 ribs total....5 good, 2 fat caked

Tried the beans which were not bad for beans

Coleslaw was good and I barely ever touch coleslaw, not really a big fan but this one was good"}
{"text":"This place makes Ribfest seem like amateur hour. You can literally TASTE the smoke on their ribs.

I thought very carefully about my star rating for Memphis BBQ and to arrive at 5 stars I asked myself, what could they do better? What should they change? And the answer is absolutely nothing. Maybe the corn bread could be a tad bit better but that's a small detail that I'm willing to overlook. I feel if you consistently leave an establishment completely satisfied how can you give any less than the best rating? 

Ribs are 5/5. Generous portions for fair prices and, like I said you can taste the smoke. Not to mention whatever sauce they use balances perfectly with that smokey flavour.

Fries are 5/5 as well. I have never had a more perfectly crunchy French fry. They're the kind of fries that don't require ketchup. I opted for gravy instead and that's another thing they do absolutely right. There's nothing worse than a good BBQ meal and subpar gravy. Memphis has perfectly thick and flavourful gravy. I often think about their gravy.

Even the small side offerings, like the coleslaw, is wonderfully sweet to balance all of that smoke. 

The space itself is something you would expect to find on the side of a dirt country road while driving through the US on a hot summer day, where all of the patrons would be truck drivers and road-trippers. It's a small space that doesn't try to be anything more than a great BBQ joint.

If you're a BBQ person, and even if you're not, I highly recommend Memphis BBQ!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner with the hubby n some friends food was delicious...and the pulled pork is the best i ever tried this far. Will for sure go again"}
{"text":"Yelped this place and decided to try something new. It was quite hidden if you didn't notice it you would've driven by. Quite busy and service was fast. There's not a lot a space for seating if it was during the lunch or dinner rush. We saw a lot of people doing take out, and would definitely try that next time. Food was delicious and super filling. Meat was falling off the bone. We ordered the meal for 2, more then enough for us. Totally worth giving a try if you like bbq and ribs!"}
{"text":"The wings and spareribs are out of this world. The fries and onion rings are amazing too. Big potion of onion rings got $5.00."}
{"text":"You think Wild Wings have good wings? Well, maybe some locations are awesome but Memphis wings, beans, fries are the just incredible & definitely the best I've had. My friends & family have tried the steaks, ribs and all the other great things on their menu and love it!! Highly rate this family operated restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Ittt wasss good but it's very over hyped they use Costco fries and the only thing worth getting is wings trust me"}
{"text":"I am not even going to talk about the food in this. I placed my order by phone and was told 25 minutes at 17:05. She did not give me the total so I had to call back to find our how much the total was. Arrived at the place early (no traffic!) At 17:17. We were not greeted by anyone for a few minutes, ignored despited standing at the counter making eye contact with the majority of the staff. 
At 17:39 which the food was finally ready 34 minutes later (which would be fine if there was an open dialogue on why it is taking longer than said).
My brother had stepped out and the cook put the food on the counter. He asked me if I had a man to carry it. I openly laughed in his face - this is at best 10 or 12 lbs of food. And yet, as a woman, I must be too weak or frail to carry it.
He asked one of his male staff to help me with it. Again I scoffed at this. 
Sexist and poorly run. At this point It doesn't matter how the food tastes - it doesn't deserve any ones business."}
{"text":"You'd think you would go to a rib place and love the ribs, which I did by the way but they make the best chicken wings I've ever had! They're smoked first and than fried and tossed in yours choice of many sauces. Going back to the ribs smoked to perfection and topped with their tangy BBQ sauce. A few yrs ago it was named the best take out in Toronto by Toronto Life Magazine and that still holds true, service is great."}
{"text":"Despite it's sketchy appearance on the outside, this place is my go-to for BBQ! The wings are fantastic, crispy but also moist on the inside. The ribs are not fall off the bone but the delicious BBQ sauce makes up for that. We always get the platter that comes with a whlole rack, wings, fries, corn bread, beans, and coleslaw. Between 4 people we've always had to take home a doggy bag so the portions are good. The service from the guys at the front is always friendly however the waitress we've been getting lately is a little slow, but maybe she's just new."}
{"text":"Its basically ribfest, but all year long!!! Have that craving for BBQ ribs and chicken but ribfest isnt until july!? Have no fear, Memphis is here! These guys know how to cook meat and can do it well. Ribs that fall of the bone and make you want to lick every finger. 

Small place with limited seating. More for takeout but eating there isnt much of a problem. Staff is super friendly with great customer service. I definitely will be going back!"}
{"text":"Awesome ribs!  Next time I'll be trying the smoked wings.  Great service as well! Get there early or visit late to avoid the line.  Tiny little place with great service and great food!"}
{"text":"Whatever Kris U said, I second the motion, but you won't see me wearing spandex Elvis outfits...

8 little tables in what looks like an old 2 room house.  How can this beat so many institutional rib places? I went to Famous Dave's in Minneapolis.  Famous Dave was part of a BBQ Pitmaster's  competition show on the Food channel, so I expected top notch ribs.  But this little shanty called Memphis in the Great White North annihilated Dave's for tenderness and flavour.  Sorry, Dave.

A massive load of food on your plate that will be hard to finish in one sitting-all of it fantastic.  This is a place with character, where it is all about the cooking (or smoking).  If you are wearing a suit, leave the jacket in the car, and roll you sleeves up like Jim Cramer.  And lose the tie.

Tablecloths?  We don't need no stinking tablecloths!"}
{"text":"Always busy so it's always hood to call in prior to coming so you just pay and leave. Their Bbq is amazing. I always get the mini combo. Their cornbread is amazing. This place is a must visit."}
{"text":"I had a chicken sandwich and my bf had a  bbq sauce chicken wings. He said it was really good I tried and I did not like it, but honestly I loved the chicken sandwich it comes with maple beens, a little salad and a lot of fries. On my bf there was fries. It took us around 1 hour to take out, so it is better you call before order it."}
{"text":"This place is a must go to place. My family and I love it here - it's this tiny hole in the wall spot that on your first time going you might just drive past!! 

I usually order the ribs and wings combo - it is extremely yummy - but HUGE this will feed 2 people. I recommend ordering ahead of time as inside is extremely tight and smokey. Also, I would stay away from their corn bread - it is extremely soft and sadly not appetizing at all."}
{"text":"The place has a truckers stop feel to it. It's pretty small and staff is down to earth. I ordered the beef brisket sandwich meal which came with beans fries and coleslaw. The beef was tender and juicy however I didn't enjoy the bread it was a regular hot dog bun that didn't compliment the meat well. They gave a decent amount of fries as well. I definitely left full and my meal was only $10.95"}
{"text":"4.5 stars! But there was no option so gave them 5 stars. I would have said 5 stars but they don't serve beer. Hahaha. Best ribs and wings in Vaughan! Their spicy garlic sauce for the wings is to die for. Quaint little setting and amazing and friendly service. They only take cash and debit card no credit. Have already been three times and am definitely going to visit several more times!"}
{"text":"I used to live near this place when I was a kid and we used to go there for their fries... after many, many, many years LOL I recently stopped by for some ribs and pulled pork and it's fantastic.  The place is pretty much a dive, but the food is fantastic and the staff are really friendly and good at what they do... me and some buds ordered their party special for takeout and we should have ordered more!"}
{"text":"There is currently a crazz going around for this place and i wanted in on it. Instead of a bbq my friends and I decided to order takeout and we ordered ALOT. From monday specials to elvis platters to whatever else was on the menu.

The ribs were fall off the bone and juicy. 

My favourite is honey garlic flavour for the wings but their dry rub is definitely a crowd pleaser. 

Pulled pork was just okay. 

Negatives: I wish they would improve their sides. The coleslaw was not enjoyable, tasted like plain vinegar with cabbage no flavour. The cornbread was horrid. There were 8 of us and most of us just dashed the bread aside. I used it to wipe the ketchup I had spilled on my table. -1 star 

Only impressive side was the beans, heavenly beans. I suggest getting the larger portion. (Caution ladies and gents flatulence is not sexy) hehehehhe.

Service +1 star. Super friendly, out standing service. So for that you get 4 stars! 

Their food is so great, just investing a lil time in the sides maybe pulled pork too and this place would be completely epic."}
{"text":"Great bbq food consistently! Small place, always busy and always a slight wait... but definitely worth it. Personal favorites are their ribs and smoked wings with their special Aaron sauce. 
Been going here for years- you will crave this after going here."}
{"text":".smoked chicken wings are outstanding,,diferent than the usual deepfried variety,pulled pork usually good, ribs good,dont go for the atmosphere,its a little divey joint but food always good. been there many times and never had a bad meal,at lunch time its very busy,they also offer takeout too"}
{"text":"Memphis is the very definition of hole-in-the-wall place with amazing food. This place looks like a broken down trailer, and they make no excuses for it. The people come for the damn good food. 

I usually get their mini-combo: for $15 you get half a rock of ribs, half a pound of wings, fries and a whole bunch of sides! Have not finished it to date. Awesome bang for your buck. Also the food is delicious.

They have a small dining area so you can sit down or just order via phone and pick it up. All in all a great BBQ place. 

TL;DR: 10/10, my go-to place for ribs in Vaughan."}
{"text":"We got the party pack 2: a full rack of ribs, 1 lb of wings, fries, slaw, and baked beans. 

The ribs were falling off the bone, and the sauce was sweet and tangy. The wings were my favorite part of the meal! We got creamy hot parm. SO GOOD. 

The only reason this is missing a star is because of the sub par corn bread and slaw. I live for sides, and these weren't the best. The corn bread had a consistency of pound cake. And the slaw was bland.

Nonetheless, the ribs and wings were amazing!"}
{"text":"Great food. Awesome and friendly service. 
Although the place is tiny but it adds character. 
Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went on a Monday and got the monday special for $25 - full rack ribs, 1 pound wings and large fries. Ribs and fries were really good but the wings were a bit hard as it was fried and not smoked. Great place and great service. Only downside is that the place is tiny with no AC. It was boiling hot in there."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night with a two friends, there isn't much seating so we were lucky to grab a table. Most customers grab take out. Our server was warm and friendly, making great recommendations along the way. Once you walk in, you smell smoke and BBQ! It envelopes you and makes you hungry immediately. The smell also reminds me of the rib fests that you go to in the summer and back yard BBQ's which is nice in November. I ordered the Elvis Platter (a sampler that has wings, pulled pork, ribs, cole slaw, baked beans and corn bread - they were out of it last night :( I have to come back to try their corn bread) and my boy friend ordered the Big Boy (6 ribs and 1lb of chicken wings -- make sure to order the smoked wings. They are to die for and my favourite part of the meal). The meat is cooked perfectly, I love the crust that they have on their ribs which keeps the meat so juicy. The meats (chicken and ribs) are fall off the bone. Their fries, cole slaw and baked beans were okay -- nothing spectacular but when you are having BBQ, it's all about the meat. I actually think their fries are from Costco, the Cavendish brand so when I saw them they were familiar but much more crispy. They also don't have a liquor license - we ordered pop to help wash all the meat down. Overall, large portions, great pricing and friendly service. I will be back again when I have my next BBQ craving. 

P.S - Yes, the store looks a bit dark and the parking is in a dark area as well but when you step into the restaurant, there is a fleury of business and a warm environment. Worth the trip as Kris has mentioned :)"}
{"text":"What can I say about Memphis.  Best bbq restaurant I have tasted. They have an organization and quick service."}
{"text":"So really looked forward to going to this BBQ joint. The line up was insane. There's only like 20 seats in the whole place. Food was meh. So disappointing. 

Brisket was not what I expected. The brioche bun was meh. Fries were ok but really had my hopes up ok the meat. 

The quality is not what you would expect - at least for a brisket. 

There are definitely better sources...for beef brisket....you just need to find them.....

Let's go hunting!"}
{"text":"Corn bread is GREAT!
Food is all around fantastic.
With good food comes a decent price point :)
Love going here"}
{"text":"We had a very positive experience at Memphis! The atmosphere is very cozy. We had the smoked chicken wings, and the chicken wings in the honey garlic and the fiesta sauce ---- absolutely magnificent! Everything was delicious! Looking forward to coming back to Memphis, or ordering some takeout!"}
{"text":"The food was good but not the best. The portion quantity for the beef brisket sandwich was meh. Was disappointed with the wings. I came here to get the original smoked wings but instead I was handed over fried wings. If I really wanted fried wings I would of gone somewhere else."}
{"text":"Wow! I'm not in the area often, but when I am... I HAVE to come back here. It's a must. It's a disservice to my stomach if I don't. 

I randomly stumbled upon this spot when I was in the area for work, and craving some good eats after a long day. It took a few minutes for us to realize where it was, and accidentally drove past it - it's a tiny diner located right smack on the side of the road. You can easily miss it. But don't let the exterior (and interior) fool you - good things come in small, slightly rough-looking packages. 

We visited on a Monday and it turns out they have a massive Monday special (kismet, I tell you). $25.00 (taxes in) for a full rack of ribs, two types of wings, and a large basket of fries which you can upgrade to onion rings for free! A great deal, and absolutely delicious food - the meat was so tender, it literally fell off the bone, and the sauces were all so flavourful. These people really know their meat! Portions were pretty large, there was even enough for lunch the next day.

Highly, highly, recommended. Service was also so pleasant, and attentive. The $25.00 cost already includes taxes, - with tip, we spent $30.00. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"My friend brought us here as he said that this joint has the best ribs in town. He wasn't lying. I am a hard-to-please kind of girl when it come to ribs and Memphis BBQ ribs blew my mind! The place is small and gets very busy (for a good reason). Service was a bit slow, but worth the wait. Service was good and portion was great too. Will definitely come back and introduce it to more friends!"}
{"text":"Do not be fooled by the \"unassuming\" exterior.  The BBQ in this place is some of the best I have ever had.  The smoked wings are a special treat.  The food is outstanding.  Price is quite reasonable under the circumstances.  A must."}
{"text":"I came here based off of the recommendations of the other reviews on Yelp and man, this is the best BBQ food I ever ate!!!! 

Pulled pork was delicious, ribs were falling off the bones with just the right amount of sauce and then you have coleslaw, fries, beans, chicken wings and corn bread. 

Highly recommend getting a party pack number 4! Try everything!!! Delicious"}
{"text":"I've been to several BBQ Festivals around the GTA and would always see these flashy set-ups with walls of awards... and as I eat their BBQ I just wish i was having Memphis instead. The pulled pork, ribs, wings and the sides are all great. Service is also great. The guy who makes your meal in the run down open kitchen (I wouldn't have it any other way) is ready to hand it to you with a friendly smile. I've never been to any of the southern states that claim to have the best BBQ but I doubt its much better than this."}
{"text":"Memphis is a small BBQ place that does a lot of takeout business. I wanted to get something to take back to the hotel. I should have done what others in line did by calling in my order: since I ordered while I was there, it took around 25 minutes to get my food. However, you get a front row seat to the cooks behind the wall, and they were friendly and apologetic for the wait. I ended up ordering the big boy combo, which included ribs, wings and fries. Overall, everything tasted good: not the best BBQ ever, but definitely satisfying for a quick dinner. 

They do offer some tables to dine inside. I would recommend calling in your order and taking it to go."}
{"text":"Nicest people. GREAT food. CHEAP and reasonable prices for everything you get.

Best bbq place in GTA, Newmarket, King City, etc."}
{"text":"The best BBQ in Toronto ! Amazing wings ! Amazing ribs ! Everything was super fantastic ! Great service too ! Will be back soon !"}
{"text":"Called ahead said it would be a hour wait time for the food. Came a little after and the food was still cooking. Walked in and had to wait 3 mins before anyone asked me of I was served. The lady at the cash totally ignored me and took the next person. Seems to be nicer to the Asians maybe because she is one.  Food is still good. Service is meh. If it want for Aaron I'm sure the customer service would be worse. He knows your name and makes you feel welcomed. He is the service.  Food is still 5 stars. Just couldn't give it to them today cause of the server who totally ignored me and others."}
{"text":"this place is delicious! its not fancy and you probably wont notice it because it honestly looks run down from the outside but trust me! you wont regret your decision. their ribs are delicious and their chicken wings as well. theres a bunch of flavours to chose from for the wings as well as combos if you had a guys night or game night going on. my brother loves the pulled pork here! it is usually ALWAYS busy so if you plan on eating in the restaurant, be prepared to wait around 20 minutes for seating unless its game night, then i suggest you order take out and bring it home."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's fairly small but the food and service are awesome. The ribs are soo soft and yummy. I find the pricing to be pretty cheap/decent for the amount of food you get and again, very delicious. I normally order the big boy combo I believe it comes with ribs, wings and fries for only about 20$. Also, don't forget to order Erin sauce on the side. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Most amazing staff! The people working there are beyond friendly! They treat New and old customers like family! You should pre-order or do take out because there is not much seating! But a very good atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best wings in not only woodbridge, but all of Ontario !!! Portions are filling, prices are amazing and the taste is killer. Go for the smoked wings, they are amazing. The fries are crispy and the coleslaw is perfection. They also have a wicked corn bread ! So good. I have been going here for about 6 years now, just go once and you'll be hooked."}
{"text":"Vegetarians be wary, this is a carnivore's paradise.The ribs are slow-cooked in the smoker, then quickly grilled after they're basted with house-made barbecue sauce for a crispy exterior and tender interior. 
 For those who want to double up on protein, the Big Boy ($20.00) offers a half rack of ribs with a pound of wings, while the Elvis Platter Combo ($18.00) gives a trio of smoked meat: three ribs, a half pound of wings and a half pound of pulled pork. Combos include fries, beans, coleslaw and cornbread.Wing fanatics should focus on the original smoked wings--marinated for two days before slow cooked in the smoker, and tossed with a choice of over 20 different sauces, such as Rasta Jerk, Fiery Honey Garlic or Wicked Hot (with five stars of hotness) and served with fries (one pound $9.75, two pounds $18.00)."}
{"text":"Love it.

Order to go typically as it gets really busy;  but for a small town bbq joint this place delivers.

Had it 3/4 times since and it's always pretty decent, obviously it's not going to be the same as a southern delight but for cold Toronto, it's actually really good man. Would go again and have since.."}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ place!!! Like other reviews say, ribfest all year round! I think it tastes better then ribfest!!

As soon as I parked my car, I could smell the BBQ in the parking lot!! 

Walked into this tiny establishment with only a few tables, staff were really friendly!

Ordered a Elvis Platter, comes with Fall-off-da-bone Pork side ribs, 6 chicken wings, a generous portion of pulled pork, onion rings/ fries/ or house salad, 2 ounces of coleslaw and 2 ounces of beans. Ordered a bottle of water, total came up to $22.30 plus tip.

The ribs were PERFECT! Tender, exploding with flavour, came off the bone perfectly, but still wasn't braised to he point where is was falling apart. Nicely grilled finish! One of the best ribs I have had at a restaurant!

The chicken wings tasted like the one from St Louis, except a bit better!! The texture, size, the way they make it is the same as St Louis, expect I found these to be a tad bit juicier!

Pulled Pork was good (I would say 3 stars) only because it was a bit too salty for me.. a bit too much BBQ sauce.. maybe would have been better if there was some bread to go with it..

Portion was super generous! I'm 235lbs with an appetite and wasn't able to finish everything. Probably won't have much of a dinner tonight either!

5 star recommend!!"}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for the most amazing pulled pork and southern rub style ribs.. this THE place.   Don't let the environment deter you from going it's worth it."}
{"text":"Maybe I made a mistake ordering the Pulled Pork sandwich? The bun was fresh but the sauce lacked any punch, any remark-ability. When consuming 1/3 of the pork sloppily fell out of the bun into my container but I truly didn't care."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon. The place definitely gets really busy, so order ahead if you're taking out.

We ordered the ribs dinner, fried wings, slow cooked wings, and a side of slaw. The ribs are a-ok. Better than Ribfest quality for sure, fall of the bone (in chunks), maybe a 7/10 on the tender scale. Fried wings are typical, nothing special. The slow cooked wings are interesting. They're tender to the point where you can lightly pull out just the bones cleanly off, and the cartiledge is basically non-existent. They are on the drier side though because of that.
 
The dining room is small (8 tables of 4 seats) and really smokey. Funny enough the power went out because of a storm and then it REALLY got smokey. Good service."}
{"text":"I love BBQ so when I was in the area I had to try this place out.  Well,  it was jammed and we had to wait quiet a while for our food.  We tried a rack of ribs and a pulled pork sandwich.  Both items were quite well cooked with the ribs holding on the bone but easily falling off on each bite.  The BBQ sauce was good if you like tangy sauces.  I am more of a Chipotle fan so I need more spice.  The smokiness was the best part."}
{"text":"This is by far my favourite favourite rib place. The ribs here are so succulent and the taste is just so amazing. The meat just falls off the bone. If eating meat too often wasn't bad for you, I would eat from here and everyday!"}
{"text":"it was one of my best meals in my life! at first we just saw the place from outside and thought that it's something very ordinary or even worse and as we were late for lunch we decided to stop. but when we started to eat, it was extremely delicious! We had ribs and wing! i will go back for sure"}
{"text":"First visit and we ordered Elvis Platter ($20.35 tax inclusive) to go- includes 1/2 lb of wings, 1/2 lb of pulled pork, pork ribs, beans, coleslaw, fries, and cornbread. Good for two people!!!!

HANDS DOWN for the quality, quantity and VALUE. Even better than the value you get at RIBFESTIVALS.

only downside was the corn bread.
But other than that, EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Really awesome place! I got the share platter for my boyfriend and I at it was DELICIOUS! I was licking the container clean! Just thinking back to that pulled pork and ribs makes my mouth water! The only thing is that there is no where to sit in the restaurant, so call ahead to order so you can pick up and eat at home."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've ever had! Small spot in downtown Woodbridge, very family homie and friendly service. Always heard about this place and finally gave it a try. I got the mini combo, meat fell off the bone. Half pound of wings where the best I've tasted and fries where great. Just wished they served alcohol. Will go back and will tell more people about it."}
{"text":"If this review is all over the place, it's cause I'm still licking off the sauce that is all over my fingers ... and as I found out later, on my cheeks too.  How did I sleep on this spot?  I'm a few years too late to the party but eventually I discovered that GTA can do some good 'cue.  

This looks like a trucker stop along side the highway 69 in the middle of no where.  The saying about not judging a book by it's cover ... it's so true here.  It's an old school portable and well worn small building with a pig doing it's best Elvis impression on the sign.  You walk in and the smoker is immediately to your left giving off that brisket scent.  I realize that when I walk out of here, dogs will be sniffing me non stop and salivating at my toes just cause I smell like eau de pork... cochon if I want to get fancy.

The place is not big at all.  Half the space is a tiny kitchen area and waiting room for take out.  There's about 4 guys crammed into the tiny spot behind the counter working EVERYthing to keep up with the constant stream of customers doing take out.  Even on a mundane Wednesday, there was at least 6 people waiting for their take out.  The seating area is no bigger than the first room.  There's maybe 6 tables of 4 chairs and it's a tight squeeze.  If you're a big group, just do take out and safe yourself the wait.  As for the decor... well, I'll safely say the light switches gleam a nice golden shade and it's not because of the setting sun shining through the windows... it's because it's all the smoke and sauce all over it from being touched.  Tables are clean and cleaned each time someone uses it... that's all that matter.  

Staff here, especially the ones doing the food, are genuinely interested in giving you the best.  They welcome you in and as you leave, they ask you what you liked ... not just your typical 'Hey... everything ok?'.  They seemed to really own the whole experience and I love that.

My BBQ knowledge comes from being in Dallas a bit and appreciating their central Texan style which is low and slow beef brisket.  Seeing how they were award winning ribs and wings, I went for that instead.  So I know nothing ... I feel like Jon Snow now.  For the wings, there are over 20 sauces... it's crazy to choose.  Just go with the smoked original and you'll be amazed how good they are.  As for their spice levels... ignore them, they say a 4 star spice level is medium... more like a mild.  Cmon Vaughan, you can take the heat.  

Original Smoked Wings - This is the must order from Memphis.  I never had smoke wings like this before.  It was unreal... true smokiness, crisped charred bits to give that amazing flavour, and the juicest fall off the bone chicken meat I've had in a long time.  I had smoked wings in another Vaughan BBQ spot and it was NO WHERE near as good as Memphis.  These were so good that I wanted to eat the whole pound myself but... that there's no way I could have horde this from the table.  We got this as 'extra' to take back to different houses afterwards... this was cleaned out and not even a piece of chicken skin was left.  5/5

Fried Wings - Seeing how the smoked ones were unbelievably good, it almost seems unfair to grade the fried ones.  These were definitely solid with a good glaze of the sauce we chose but the smokiness of the other wings just added to the whole flavour.  These were juicy but the meat just wasn't as tender as the smoked ones.  Like the original smoked, these were big wings and full of meat.  They're still excellent if you rather have sauced up spicier wings.  4.5/5

Ribs - I have a total appreciation of these ribs and how the staff didnt drench these in a sauce to hide them.  These were beautiful and served with just enough drizzle of sauce but never covering the gorgeous caramelized charred spots.  These were by far the meatiest ribs I've had in GTA and Toronto.  They were so tender and just enough to easily peel off the bone but not flopping off (completely mushy fall off the bone is not a good thing!).  I totally enjoyed eating these ... even I was teased for getting the sauce everywhere on me.  Thank god for the wet naps at the table. I needed one... ok, more like 3.  Worth it.  5/5

Onion Rings & Fries aka Fixins - So typical fixins are potato salad, baked beans, and coleslaw... which I ate none of them because I was all about the great meat BUT I did try the onion rings and fries.  I'm going to admit that the star of the show is the ribs and wings which you can see on their signs and all the awards in the front room.  It isnt the rings or the fries.  It kinda reminds me of McCain a bit ... a well done version of it.  Nothing exciting but definitely not offensive.  3.5/5

Is it the best BBQ in Toronto?  I'm not sure but it's definitely the best one I've tried so far.  Affordable, meaty, and delicious... you can't ask for better.   This is definitely a worthwhile detour to get some of the meatiest and best wings in the GTA."}
{"text":"Cheap and likely the best ribs in gta!
(camp 31 in Paris still owns the title of best, for multiple reasons, but memphis is closer!)"}
{"text":"The food here is on point! Ribs and wings is my go to. You get what you pay for and is definately worth every dollar. 

Not a plave if you want to bring 12 people because the dine in area is tight. If you want to get some food and get in and out this is my spot to go for some ribs and wings.

The service is respectable, the staff is friendly. Love this place."}
{"text":"The best simple and honest bbq place i've eaten at. Sure, you may be able to find comparable bbq at a fancy restaurant, but it would be for a significantly higher price point.

I ordered a full rack of ribs dinner with a soft drink.
Best ribs i've had. Ever.
Fries were very good.
Included: coleslaw and maple baked beans.

For 21 dollars, thats the cheapest rack if ribs with sides i could find. Price point aside, the ribs are amazing, the best i've had.

Would, and have recommended this place to all my friends.

Pros:
Phenomenal food.
Price point of franchise restaurants (or less).

Cons:
Small seating area
Closes too early (for me anyways)

Definitely plan on coming back. The pros significantly out weigh the cons in this case. Fully deserving of the perfect score."}
{"text":"It was a small and out of the way bbq joint. Excellent ribs and pulled pork. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Came here for the Monday deal, which is such a steal. The staff were very friendly and the wait wasn't so bad, I'd say about 15-20 minutes, so I left happy. But, when I got home, I found the portion was really small. The deal includes a half rack of ribs, a lb of wings, and large fries for $25. The ribs and fries I got were great, but the lb of wings was definitely not a lb at all! There were 10 tiny wings that I could finish in just one bite which was really disappointing. It was still delicious, but next time I think I'll head to a wing joint for a true 1 lb of wings."}
{"text":"All good things come to an end for example mephis grills pulled pork is no longer the champ yet their loyal customers keep on returning of whom I am one."}
{"text":"Alot of people wait for Rib Fests to gorge on ribs, but Memphis BBQ is open year round and offer's some of the best (or maybe the best?) ribs you can get. I discovered this place by reading a \"Top 10 best ribs in Toronto\" article, however this establishment is in Woodbridge. The food at Memphis BBQ so good that its number one on a top 10 list for a different city.

You don't really need much convincing, the ribs here are the perfect mix of smokey and BBQ saucy. Most other restaurants I find slant towards dry smokey, or saucy BBQ. Memphis gives the best of both worlds. The wings here are also top tier, they are better than most establishments that specialize in chicken wings. I've brought dozen's of friends here for food and they've done the same to their friends and family. Memphis BBQ gets my highest recommendation, it is the absolute best BBQ restaurant in the area and even if its hard to get to if your without car and live in the city, making the trek here is worth your time. Whenever you eat ribs after trying Memphis BBQ, you'll wish you where just eating at Memphis."}
{"text":"Love this joint. Never had a negitive experience here. The staff is very friendly and helpful. For the amount of food you receive and quality, the price is on point.  I just wish they would open more locations as I have to drive 40 minutes just to eat here."}
{"text":"Memphis BBQ is a perfect spot for a down to earth date. (Maybe not for the first one!)

Big Bone Combo ($20) includes 1/2 rack of ribs, 1 lb wings (smoked one recommended), fries, coleslaw and much more. Great to share or just to finish that alone and feel busting full.

What more down to earth than using your hands, licking your fingers and eating meat in a trailer like dining area.

Huge TV showing Food Network, so if your date is boring, you can always just watch the show.

BTW, the poor ventilation in the \"trailer\" might make you smell smokey and meaty after. But that's much better than the cologne some of my cheap dates been using.

Cash or Debit Only. Hope my date has Cash on him?!"}
{"text":"Get takeout so you do not need to wait for a table. Mouthwatering ribs. I have thought about them a few times after getting them a few weeks ago."}
{"text":"I LOVE BBQ, and this place is exactly the sort of place that will make you love it, too.

Now that they've franchised, it's easier to get my fix, which is even better. I took some friends to the Milton location a few weeks ago, and I was not disappointed.  The quality is still there (a common issue for expanding businesses), and the price point was pretty good, too!

We got the #4 party pack, which is a rack of ribs, 1 pd. wings (get them SMOKED! trust me!) and 1pd. pulled pork - plus fries, slaw, cornbread and beans. Everything was just delicious! The ribs were perfection - the meat just fell off the bones, even when they were getting cold, you didn't have to work for it - the slow cooked perfection would just fall off the bone.

I've never had a bad meal there, and look forward to many more. It's not fancy, but that's not what real BBQ is about. Trust me - this place is one of the best in the GTA."}
{"text":"Been here several times and never disappointed. Pulled pork and ribs are great. Combo players giver you a little taste of everything.

If you want to eat in, May have to wait add there's limited seating. Service is friendly enough although it's not the reason to return."}
{"text":"This place is tiny! Expect long waits, but great food.
We took a seat in one of the 6 tables (majority of people seemed to be picking up) and were pleasantly surprised with our experience. 

Fries cooked to perfection, probably the best I've ever had. I had the Memphis burger with bacon and cheese which was delicious. Baked beans are a little sweet for my liking but I enjoyed the coleslaw."}
{"text":"Why so many amazing reviews?
It made me believe this would be my last meal before I die!

But it turned out it they talked the talk but didn't fully walk the walk...

I spent over 100$ on a party combo which came with hardly anything !!!
I was extremely disappointed with my 7 chicken wings which were suppose to be  \"2 pounds\" , my 1 bun, coleslaw , sauce , a small fries and a shit load of ribs -which btw this was suppose  to be a meal for 4-5 people.

Now to me ..100$ for this was not worth it!!!!!!

The ribs tasted okay.. nothing mind blowing like everyone has described!"}
{"text":"This place is the best place to go if you're looking for some old fashioned BBQ! We got the Party Pack 1 for a small get together and it fulfilled everyone's appetites. The meat on the rack of ribs slid right off the bone, the cornbread was amazing and the fries were delicious.

Admittedly on first glance you have your preconceived notions that this place seems run down. It's not the prettiest looking spot and the parking lot is small.  Don't let that fool you though! The food and the owners/staff are amazing and give you the best service and smiles :)"}
{"text":"What an amazing meal I had!  It was my first time there and definitely will not be my last.  The guys working were great.  My wife and I ordered a combo pack that included 1 pound of wings, 1 pound of ribs and 1 pound of pulled pork,  The sauce was too die for.  It was tasty and tangy.  I look forward to having it again.

Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Fall off the bone ribs and crispy fries. Reasonably priced, I enjoyed the 6 bone rib lunch and couldn't finish it all. Cornbread was moist and loved the baked beans nice and smokey, great slaw too. I will be back!! Only downside would be that they don't take credit card not really a big deal but good to know going in."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in Woodbridge for bbq. the place looks a little sketchy from the outside, but you know what they say about restaurants with ratchet furniture - the food is bomb. And that's true to this restaurant. The staff are friendly. There are literally less than 10 tables to dine in so your best bet is take out. The best wings in Woodbridge."}
{"text":"I don't usually go all the way to Vaughn just to grab dinner but I luv ribs and I luv real hole-in-the-walls so it didn't take much convincing to get me to Memphis BBQ.

We went at prime dinner hour on a weekday night and there was a short 10-min wait.

Now about the food...
My 3-star rating is deceiving. I would give very different ratings for their ribs versus their wings. I would give the ribs a solid 4 out of 5. But I would give their wings a 1 out of 5 (and I think I'm being generous.)

You know those Presidents Choice frozen wings?? The honey garlic ones, for example, are waaaaaaay better than the wings at this place. How is it that the same kitchen that pumps out some of the best ribs in town also puts out these awful wings??

The Good
- ribs were tasty and fall-off-the-bone tender
- service was good
- prices are fair

The Bad
- wanna hazard a guess??"}
{"text":"This is the best Ribs place hands down!  Once you get in the parking lot you smell the smokey goodness.  It seems to be a family run place.  The ribs are smoked to perfection and they also smoke their wings as well which are really good too.  I've tried many ribs at ribfests and I have to say I'd rather go to Memphis for their ribs.  Unfortunately they don't sell alcohol and their dining area is quite small so I usually get take out.  Their parent company is big bone bbq which is sometimes at ribs fests as well."}
{"text":"Being from America I didn't expect much from Canadian BBQ but man was I WRONG! Here guys have their A game going here. The wings were fantastic and the pulled pork wasn't bad either. Their medium sauce is great and I actually wish I had gotten more of them. It's small and easy to miss but totally worth it. 

Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Come here very often to get take out when the bbq cravings hit, usually get the Elvis platter or a party platter if there's more people. I love the dry rub chicken wings and their saucy ribs. The Smokey flavour they have is really nice and it just makes you crave more."}
{"text":"I always order the half rack ribs and half pound wings with fries so I get a bit of everything. Probably the best tasting food in its category that I've tasted so far! The ribs and wings are smoked to perfection, and the fries are just the right crisp. 

However, if you dine in, its not too spacious and it takes a bit of time to get your food. Sometimes during peak hours, people aren't able to grab a table. Nonetheless, I love to eat here because the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"I took a drive up to this place and was pleasantly surprised by the joint. 
On the outside it isn't the most appealing building I have ever seen. The difference is when you get inside you are surrounded by the aroma of BBQ. I did have to wait for a table when I got up there, but it was worth the wait for me. I really wish this place was bigger than 6 tables and some beer to go with the BBQ would be nice. This place has room to grow, but the definitely got the BBQ right.
I had the Elvis platter to get a taste of everything and I would say it's one of the best places to get BBQ in the GTA. I will have to try some other places to compare it to this benchmark."}
