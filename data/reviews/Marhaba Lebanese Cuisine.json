{"text":"This place is definitely a staple if you live/work in this neighbourhood. The shawarma is fantastic and very reasonably priced. Two falafel for $9 (tax inc) is a great deal in my books.Their North American food is apparently not bad either. My friend got the home-made burger and seemed to really like it. The business owner is personable and loves to get to know his customers which definitely makes the experience of grabbing lunch all the more enjoyable. 

The only reason I'm not giving it a 5-star rating is because it's not the prettiest. There's some bar seating and one table with chairs and everything's a little run down, but that's par for the course in this area and not important if you're doing take-out. Bottom line, if you like good shawarma, don't pass this place up!"}
{"text":"Went here my first night living in Toronto and the man working was very friendly and nice, but the food was AMAZING. I had the chicken shawarma and some garlic potatoes, Sooo yummy I'll be going there lots!"}
{"text":"I didn't expect much from the outside but this place is great. Everything is fresh and I can add whatever i'd like. The prices are great and the staff is very friendly. I would feel kind of awkward eating there since there is only one table and window seating but it's great for quick takeout!"}
{"text":"I always eat here because it's close. Don't be put off by the neighborhood, the shawarma is amazing! You can tell the ingredients are fresh and the dude really loves making his customers happy."}
{"text":"The dude makes an excellent falafel. Don't be put off by the location. The place is clean, organized and friendly. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Fear not of the surroundings. Although this area has its share of problems, Marhaba is not one of them. I eat a lot of sharmz and falafels ok. This place is truly a diamond in rough. The thing that separates this from the pack is their original in house hot sauce. It's a bit of a creamy hot sauce that packs a nice level of punch. They're falafel balls are made to order, none of that stale premade at the beginning of the day stuff. Their chicken and beef is on point too. Daily specials are a great deal, like the $6.99 for 2 falafels on Saturdays. Service is A1"}
{"text":"Just ordered through Uber Eats. Friday @930pm. The food was exceptional. Fresh and delicious. The garlic and hummus was very flavourful! Only issue was with the potatoes. Dry, like they were sitting in a hot plate too long. If it wasn't for the potatoes, I would have for sure rated a 5 star! Overall, food was SO delicious we will definitely give them another try."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite,  but too many red flags.  I love shwarmas like everyone else,  but there were flies pitching on the food and no one seemed to care,  the toppings looked dried out and withered,  very old looking.  I walked out without ordering,  I just couldn't.  Area is sketchy as f too (but this doesn't usually bug me if there's good food)  sorry I didn't give it a try?-No regrets."}
{"text":"Was really hoping I would enjoy this place as it is the closest shawarma in walking distance from my place and looked well-priced, but was sadly disappointed.

As people have mentioned, the area is sketchy and the place is pretty dingy, which are things that don't usually bother me but the inside of the place didn't look to be very clean, which is something that does bother me. 

Lettuce was clearly browning and limping away in front of me, decided to try a shawarma anyways. It is somewhat cheap, around $5/6+ tax for one shawarma, but the shawarma was mediocre at best. Sparse filling, slim in size. I would rather walk the extra 5 min over to Church for the same prices at Alibabas or pitch the extra few bucks and go to Pita Land. 

Guy working seemed friendly enough. Perhaps I just caught em on a bad day, but I don't think I would go back for a second try :("}
{"text":"A five minute walk from my work place, Marhaba is the most convenient option for a quick lunch. So, boy am I glad that this place makes some amazing shawarma! 

It's a dingy little joint on the notorious street corner of Dundas and Sherbourne, so I wasn't expecting much when I first walked in. But then I met a really cool, chatty guy behind the counter who made me a fantastic beef shawarma with fresh ingredients, just as I wanted... and I am picky - it's got to be mild, it's got be be extra extra garlicky and it's got to be without onions and pepper. Not a lot of people get my order to perfection; hence, I am extra fond of the places where I can hover over the counter going \"Some of this... no, not that...\" - and I get to do that at Marhaba, while the guy behind the counter attentively works on my Shawarma. 

Prices are fair and that's a bonus! $5 for one shawarma, $8 for two, and $6 for a shawarma combo with pop. Marhaba is a takeout joint, and even though there's single row seating near the window, it'd be too weird to do it because of the size of the place. It's pretty tiny. Also, it's not the cleanest place... but I keep coming back. The shawarma is just that good!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite place for chicken shawarma.  All fresh ingredients and juicy chicken make for one of the best shawarma around.  And it's open well into the evening for a late dinner or snack.

The owner is a terrific guy who welcomes you with open arms and a genuine smile."}
