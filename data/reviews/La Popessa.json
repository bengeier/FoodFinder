{"text":"My buddy's fettucini Alfredo tasted like a tv dinner.  My spicy linguini based concoction was a little better.  Servers were nice.  2 out of 5 bowls of pasta."}
{"text":"Manger directement a la Popessa c'est un peu comme un fast food de pâtes.
La variété est la , on ne peut rien dire la-dessus. Le goût aussi y est, et le prix est plus que raisonnable. C'est juste que l'ambiance n'est pas faite pour passer du temps la-bas.

C'est pourquoi je commande a mon bureau et je déguste tranquillement mon repas. C'est chouette car ils font affaire avec la compagnie Just-Eat qui fait la livraison de restaurants qui ne l'offrent pas normalement. J'adore !"}
{"text":"Si on a envie de pâtes et qu'on est un peu pressé, la place est parfait. Grande sélection de pâtes, sauces (ma préférée étant l'Atlantique!) et extras. Les portions sont généreuses, le service est rapide et les prix sont abordables. Le tout accompagné avec un petit pain et une canette de Brio, vous avez le lunch sur le pouce parfait."}
{"text":"Not great. We ate here during one of our first nights in Montreal: if we'd have known then what we know now, we'd have stayed away.

The pasta was chewy and flavorless, the sauce was mostly garlic, and the sides were so forgettable... I've forgotten about them. The best part of the meal was the waiter, who gave us all the good gossip about his friend, a ticket scalper, who the waiter insisted could get us good concert tickets for a fair price.

Unfortunately, an engaging waiter does not a memorable meal make. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Amazing. By far my favorite fast food pasta bar in Montreal ever!!!!! 
Pictures up later.
I wish they had these in la"}
{"text":"Very good pasta for an inexpensive price! Came with a friend for dinner the other night. We were quite satisfied! Perfect portions too!"}
{"text":"Welcome to the culinary apocalypse. Simply not knowing any better, and wanting a quick bite to eat, we went in. I ordered the Stroganoff but got something akin to diluted sour cream soup with chewy \"beef.\" My spouse ordered the smoked cheese ravioli in the garlic sauce and it smelled analogous to seafood which had been dipped in liquid smoke. We have now lived through the apocalypse, and our tummies are very angry with us. Also, a man started eating his food, off the counter, while still in line. Total weirdness. But, hey, on the upshot, the garlic bread tastes like garlicky white bread candy."}
