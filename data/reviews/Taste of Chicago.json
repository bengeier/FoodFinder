{"text":"Best. Cheese Fries. In the State.  Hands down the hand cut fries are outstanding.  The order is HUGE so share it.  The Chicago dog was good, soft bun, tiny diced onions, yada yada - I look forward to trying their Italian Beef.  The food is priced well and there were enough seats to eat in!  If this place had a little better atmosphere, I would give it 5 stars.  Also, not a huge fan of the employees, although I guess relatively surly cashiers and cooks is truly reflective of the Chicago Hometown HotDog joint.

Down the street from my office, I'll be back weekly! Where's the nearest gym????"}
{"text":"I used to come here for for a \"brat\" and the best hand-cut home-made fries. First time back in 10 years. It's under new ownership now. The fries are still very good. I had a jumbo Vienna all-beef hot dog. Hard to screw this one up. It was as good as Luke's of Chicago nearby. Great little seating area outside. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Microwaved bun , no snap to the casing of the Vienna dog because it sat around in the steamer too long, French Fries barely warm and soggy   If this place was in my home town of Chicago , they would be out of business and run out of town in less than a week!!  Shame on you guys. Hey Everybody. This is NOT the taste of Chicago"}
{"text":"Not really sure what all the hype is about. Average dog, average chili and average fries. I will say that the staff were super awesome and this place is super cheap. So if you are looking to get uncomfortably full for less than 10 bucks then this is the place."}
{"text":"***************Consistently Good***********************

                   They close at 4:30pm .......watch your timing
Since we were going to a late afternoon movie ........ we stopped and ate first.
The Hot Dog Combo Basket with fries and included drink .......$5.68 + tax.

Everything was delicious.
I'm not sure ....... but I think their using 12 dogs to the pound.
I'd prefer 8 dogs to the pound ...... it makes for a far better sandwich.

Anyhow ........ their far better than Al's Beef or Lukes.

However, \"Taste\", will never be competition for Chicago Hamburger Company."}
{"text":"I not a foodie and I don't watch the Food Network. But my job takes me all over the valley so I have to grab lunch on the run whenever I can. I stopped by Taste of Chicago this week and chose the Italian Beef. Never made it to my next appointment. 20 minutes later I ended up in the mens room of a fast food joint a few miles south on Scottsdale Road with an acute case of the runs.

I pride myself on my cast iron stomach and can't remember when I last had a case of the runs. But I shouldn't have been surprised. Environmental Services last inspected Taste of Chicago in August 2012 and found that the temperature in their walk in refrigerator was not cold enough. The inspector made them throw out all their ground beef. Coincidence? I think not."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I go there regularly for lunch.  I always find the staff friendly and the food excellent.  My fav is the brat - really good.  I don't know about the review describing an $8.00 hotdog.  A regular Chicago dog with mustard/ketchup and Chicago bright green relish is $2.99.  I find their prices very reasonable for the quality of the food I've had.  Anyway - I really like it.  Reminds me of home - Chicago."}
{"text":"The Chicago dog is delicious, I also enjoyed their fries. However if you are looking for a good bratwurst you won't find it here :( not flavorful at all. I will come back to try the sausage with sweet peppers. But I will never get the brat."}
{"text":"I don't know if it tastes like Chicago or not but it's reasonably safe to say that the stuff is cooked to order and consistently greasy and overstuffed, so maybe it is like Chicago?

The atmosphere is cool I guess, but I'm a Bears fan so it's cool seeing the old memorabilia on the walls."}
{"text":"If you like Portillo's, you will love Taste of Chicago! The loaded Chicago dog is excellent, and the fries are the best!! We have found a replacement for Portillo's. We bring our friends when in town and they agree."}
{"text":"Whoa, the Italian Beef is outstanding! I am also a fan of the Chicago Dogs. I like fries a bit crispy, so I need to ask for them that way. Otherwise, their fries are a tad limp."}
{"text":"Moved to AZ from Chicago about a year ago, and this is the closest I've found to a good Chicago hot dog.  They actually know how to make them, which is a step ahead of almost everyone else around here.  Their fries aren't bad either.  A bit pricey unless you catch one of their specials.  Good lunch place, plenty of tv's, friendly staff.  Nothing compared to authentic Chicago food, but again, the closest I've found out here so far."}
{"text":"I've been going here for the past six months or so and have yet to have a bad meal.  The owner is a very nice woman and it's a great place to have lunch and catch up on the latest sports news as ESPN is usually on the large flat panels they have there.  

In terms of food I usually get the jumbo chicago dog combo ($7.00) which  fills me up.  I've also had the BBQ Beef which is also great.  Being a Chicago native myself, I appreciate the good food this place provides at a great price."}
{"text":"I agree with Sean, as a Chicago native every good 'street food' type joint has the hot dog statue outside and the sports posters and stuff lining the walls.
Today saw me ordering a gyro and I really would not recommend this as a gyro place.  The pita was good enough, but the meat was weird-dry and VERY lemony...tzatziki would hold it's own I suppose but the meat totally took away from the experience.  Seven bucks for a gyro and small pop.  Take that for what it's worth..........
I've eaten lunch here previously and I thought the beef sandwiches were okay, not great by any means but I'd order a beef sandwich way before the gyros should I lose my mind and patronize this establishment again."}
{"text":"Had the sweet italian, nice but should have asked for cheese or something.
Will try the chicago dog next time in town, looked like those orders got more fries"}
{"text":"Not fresh! Ate here a week ago and thought I would give it a try... I'm from Chicago and was dissatisfied and not happy with the food. Never going back and wasting my money.
Portillos is cheaper and fresh and a Chicago institution."}
{"text":"I am wondering if some of the older reviews pertain to previous owners as I think this place recently re-opened, maybe has new management?

At any rate, I had a great hot dog here, they told me the hotdogs were shipped from Chicago, they sure were yummy!  The guys behind the counter when I was there were really nice.  They also have homemade tamales, didn't try them as I was full, but next time for sure.  

Not sure what was ordered for $8.00 cuz my hotdog was in the $3.00 range. I would give it a try if you are in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Taste of Chicago is an interesting place to enjoy some Vienna Beef Red Hots.  I particularly liked their Italian Beef, but the best part is sitting around looking at the Bears stuff and watching the Cubs on TV.  Not a lot of south-sider stuff, though.

Just look the Super Dawg statue."}
{"text":"This place is pretty delicious. I've come here for a while and the food is consistent. I enjoy their cheesy beef and their delicious fries. 

So if you like greasy food and ESPN, this place is for you."}
{"text":"Nothing special...  A so so Chicago dog!!!
No resemblance to the dogs I had in Chicago this summer.  The place is more like a \"Taste of Cleveland\"!  You get what you pay for... but not here!!!"}
{"text":"Nice people and clean place. That being said the \"brat\" i ordered was the same quality of a sausage of the roller at a gas station. The chicken sandwich and burger that the others ordered were similar to what you would expect from a freezer bag at your local grocer. Overall not worth the praise, anyone from Chicago or Midwest could calm out the lack of flavor and soul from a mile away."}
{"text":"Very nice Italian beef and similar sandwiches (cheesy beef, barbecue beef). Nice thick-cut meat on hearty bread, with pretty good fries.

Quite a bit different from some of the other Chicago places nearby, but I really enjoyed it, and came by at least a couple times a month when I worked in the area."}
{"text":"This could easily get a higher rating after a second visit but for now i'll leave this at 3 stars. As a native of the Chicago area, I'm always craving some of my old favorites. I've tried plenty of places around town and Taste of Chicago has the best Italian beef I've tried outside of the Windy City. It's a kind of a hole in the wall kind of place, though it is clean and well maintained. I really enjoyed my Italian beef but it failed to send me into the ecstasy food coma I regularly feel in Illinois. The fries that it came with we're pretty mediocre and had a weird after taste. Not a whole lot of atmosphere but thats easily forgiven. Overall a positive experience, but a return visit is needed to get a better feel for the menu."}
{"text":"I ate here yesterday was ok.  So ok I'm going back today. I had the Brutwurst dog combo, yum! Today I'll be having the chicken sandwich. I like the casual setup, liked when I walked in the place it was filled with men ....lol! Keep you posted."}
{"text":"Chicago dog with everything!!! Very good
Burger and fries are excellent as well, I grew up in Chicago, so just like home"}
{"text":"Had this place for lunch. The cashier was polite. I order the numb chili cheese dog and fries. Wow is was so amazing. 10$ is a little more than I would like to spend on a hotdog, but is was really good."}
{"text":"Great place to go on lunch breaks. Food is great quality and the workers are kind. One of my favorite spots. Cheesesteaks are very good as well! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Italian beef is unbelievable. Giardiniera is probably the best I've ever had. I also had an Italian sausage on the side and it was a double thumbs up. This was a win!"}
{"text":"Regular hotdogs are nothing special. Asked for sauerkraut but should have asked for extra, you get very little. 

Chili cheese fries, skip them. Fries were soggy and tasted of old oil used to cook something else."}
{"text":"Good hot dog, great fries and the best pizza puff in the state! We just ordered a few things but will be back for more."}
{"text":"Food's pretty good, fairly priced. Great family owned vibe. Had to walk the kid at the register through how to apply my coupon (first time the total didn't change). 

High chairs but no changing table in the rest room, so next time will probably get the order to go."}
{"text":"I'll give it to Taste of Chicago, it looks the part.  Chicago sports stuff- check!  And that's where the Chicago similarities end.

As I must do for any place that claims \"Chicago\", I tried the Italian beef.  Hmmmm.... notsomuch.  Pretty bland, overly chewy, too thickly sliced.  Wait.  Is this store bought?  You really shouldn't have to wonder that."}
{"text":"Really delicious hot dogs! Will have to come back and try the beef sandwiches. Very friendly staff. Classic Chicago menu with decent prices."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, this place is tasty, but goodness sakes, did I seriously just pay that much for a hot dog that tastes like the $1.50 ones at Costco down the way?"}
{"text":"Been to 2 of these restaurants, one on the east side and the other on the west, both times they were fairly slow the food was fair, but the service was horrendous and took forever to get food, really sucks since was looking forward to going back there but don't like waiting an hour to get served"}
{"text":"Fresh and good but the actual hot dog on the Chicago dog tastes like one from the grocery store. Meets the craving for Chicago but not completely."}
{"text":"I used Taste if Chicago for a company picnic and they were great.  The hotdogs and the toppings were delicious and a big hit, as were the garden burgers.  The owner was great to work with, I really appreciate the ease he made it. Will definitely being going back."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch after driving by several times and most likely will not make a second trip.  The hot dog selection had variety yet $8 plus for a hot dog seems steep. The cashier that took my order was not the most pleasant to deal with and seemed perturbed when I asked to add some things to my order.
The food was good yet again, they are hot dogs and even I can make hot dogs. 
Good luck to this place yet not one of my faves."}
{"text":"I'm totally confused as to what previous poor reviews were about - my coworkers and I thoroughly enjoy this place! We've been here a few times since I started months ago - but a few of them have been coming since before then. 

The decor is nothing to speak of - just a plain, down home small counter-service restaurant with some sights & sounds of Chicago. The guys who have worked the counter were nothing but sweet. 

I've only had the Italian beef and cheese fries. The Italian beef tastes about as Chicago-authentic as authentic gets - so much au jus too! The cheese fries were decent - maybe a little too salty for my taste, but in general good. I think my combo + a drink have been about $8 - great value! A few of my coworkers have gotten their Chicago hotdogs and love them too! 

A little bit of the Midwest in the heart of the West warms this native Midwesterner's heart."}
{"text":"Maybe 2.5 stars but I'm rounding down because fries were old and refried to make them warm. Also, there were a bunch of short broken fries. I ate the longer ones. The short one were just too over cooked, bitter and hard to dip to enjoy. The chicago dog was tasted fine and the service was okay.
The first time i came here was last month with my 12 year old and the fries were fresh and perfectly fried which made the dog more enjoyable. This time.. not so much.
Consistency is important because when i crave food from a restaurant i want the same experience that brought me back to begin with. Now I'm worried what to expect and should i risk my time and money again"}
{"text":"i love their Turkey burgers. so yummy. Not a fan of there frys...it reminds me of thicker In N Out. but add chili cheese to them and they are great . but other then that ive had all their hotdogs..and burgers. I try a different one everytime I can . Guys that work there are nice and laid back. Small place when it gets packed though. I still love this place though."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!!  I have been coming here for years but stopped for a while because the lady that owned it for a while was a complete psycho!!!  The new owner is great and he remembers my order when I come in.  I usually get the Monster dog.  Delicious!!!!  Everyone who likes Chicago food or just hot dogs should come here!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a nice place, they have some authentic food. The fries are a little soggy but I went for the sandwiches and to see how it was inside. I will definitely return to try some other things. They are reasonably priced. It has some cool decor. And there were some regulars in there so you know the place has good food."}
{"text":"The Chicago-style Vienna Beef hotdog was good and authentically prepared and \"frankly\" that's all I was after when I patronized this walk-in restaurant. I was short on time.

The \"dog\" came out of the kitchen quick. A Chicago White Sox or Bears game was looping on an overhead TV.  Yes, I know that is baseball or football, respectively, but I generally pay little attention to either.  It did kind of feel like a Chicago Vienna dog shop in that it was sparsely decorated in mostly white laminate save for a lot of the same type posterettes common to a Chicago hotdoggery

While I wouldn't make a trip across towns to eat here, I'll stop by for a Chicago Dog fix now and then when I'm near Scottsdale Road and Thunderbird. BTW, they had a lot of other traditional Chicago hotdoggery menu items too, like those lovely golden cardboard baskets of golden, steamy fries."}
