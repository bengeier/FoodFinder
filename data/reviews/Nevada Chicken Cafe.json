{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight. Chicken and ribs were spot on. The staff is extremely nice, and the portions are perfect size. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I have come to NCC about 4 times in the past month and a half. The first time was at this location and I ordered a salad with dressing on the side. The cashier (girl with glasses and braces who I believe is Andrea) quickly said yeah when I asked for the dressing on the side. What I got was a salad drenched in dressing. It was late and so I didn't have time to return it. The second time I also ordered with her and the same thing but this time I sent it back. Third time I went to the Arroyo location and the guy got my order right! Well I decided to return to the arroyo location even if it is out of my way just to not have the mixup happen again. I went in and almost walked right back out when I saw Andrea was the cashier. I ordered and said \"please make sure the dressing is on the side\" she said yup and of course I did not get dressing on the side. The food is great and everyone else is wonderful but I will walk out if she is the cashier next time."}
{"text":"The food was AMAZING!!! The chicken is so tender and the ribs! Great healthy options for a reasonable price. Can't wait to eat here again!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints... The smell leads you in ... The food makes you keep eating .. After devouring ribs, chicken, mashed potatoes, Mac and cheese and small Caesar salad ... I needed a nap! I love this place. The prices are great considering its ribs just off the grill  and the taste is fabulous. I haven't tried all the sides but there's so many to choose from. My top choice are the mashed potatoes! Amazingness.. Idk what they put in but ... Mmmmhhmmmmmmm greatness!"}
{"text":"Just plain awful, chicken was dry and small. The ribs were fatty and very small portions. The prices are way out of line. If you call that quality food at a premium price, you sure did fool the public. The question is, for how long. No need to worry KFC, Kane's, Popeye's, they won't be around for long. Combo platter was 12.99 that included a small breast and wing, really ! Where did you find chicken's that small ? Just 3 ribs small enough to leave a child hungry. Trust me, you get more food in the $5 combo box from KFC."}
{"text":"Wonderful place to eat. Sports, music, and you can watch them prep your food. Its great. The service is great and the food is even better."}
{"text":"I still remember when Nevada Chicken first opened. I went there often with coworkers. I hadn't been there in awhile but had the opportunity to have lunch there on 9/14. I still love the food. The meals never disappoint. I had the chicken with a side of chicken pasta. Loved it. I noticed they give tortillas now. I continue to be very pleased. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"We had bought some gift cards and had an extra so decided to drive over from Henderson to try the place. It was great.  The staff was friendly. You order at a counter and they give you a number and deliver to the table. We both ordered the chicken leg-thigh and rib combo. Very tasty. Unlike a lot of bbq aficionados, I grew up with dry grilled ribs, and these were flavorful even without sauce (which is in bottles at the small salsa bar).  The cucumber salad and Mac & Cheese were good.  Overall a good meal for the money. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing mac and cheese and amazing service of course the chicken is fire. I work close and its such a pleasure as i crave it all the time"}
{"text":"I LOVVVEEE NCC! I've only been to the Sahara location, I always enjoy walking up and smelling the fresh BBQ cooking on their outside grill. All the side are on the healthier side, which I appreciate. Great kid's meal options too! Best ribs in town!  I can't  wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, Great friendly staff. Food was horrible! baked beans tasted like Bush's baked beans out of a can. I can still taste the aluminum; potato salad seemed like it was brought from a grocery store. Combination plate, flavor of the food was good until you added \"their\" bbq sauce. The sauce tasted like it was Kraft bbq sauce from a plastic bottle. I will never go back...I'll stick with M&M Soul food café, even though it is out of the way for me."}
{"text":"I've read some of the previous reviews already before posting my own, and overall I love the place and will be a repeat customer.   We got the baby back ribs since they are dry rub and not smothered in BBQ sauce like they normally are - which might be the source of some of the bad reviews.  Personally we love dry rub ribs much better, and since they gave us sauce on the sides, we didn't understand all the complaints about the ribs being under seasoned.  I actually preferred the ribs without the sauce and the seasoning was perfect to me, my gf dipped them in the sauce however."}

Our only complaint is that the wait time is LONG, so prepare yourselves for that.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Don't let the smell fool you, smells much better than it taste. The white meat chicken is super dry and the dark meat lacks any flavor.  I was excited to see on the menu that they serve organic chicken; scrolled to the bottom of menu and it states only served if available.  The mac n cheese is horrible, like really really horrible. Potato salad was ok, but if I pay almost $20 for my meal I'd like to enjoy more than just salad.  Safe yourself the dissatisfaction and hit up Jason's Deli, Sammy's or even Chipotle, all of which are in the same shopping center."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for lunch while working at the NV Energy office across the street. Have to admit we were drawn in by the inflated chicken man out front. I wouldn't call this place awesome or anything but they were grilling chicken right outside and the prices were reasonable and the chicken tasted great and the potato salad was nice and firm. So a bit low-key, a bit dingy, but tasty."}
{"text":"Great place ! Great Service !   Tabish is the best and very accommodating. I would recommend Nevada Chicken to all"}
{"text":"Great place for chicken and ribs. I usually come here about two times per week and it's always consistently good. The staff is always friendly and I always enjoy my visit."}
{"text":"Do not trust their website menu.  I checked out their menu, then decided to try it out.  What a sticker shock when I checked out.  I ordered the four piece dark with two sides.  According to menu online, I should have been charged $6.25 for the chicken and $4.00 for the sides.  Not the case.  I was charged $11.25 for the chicken and $2.50 for each side.  Total bill with tax was $17.59 what a BIG difference.  Everything I received was just OK, nothing specIal.  I did ask the cashier about the difference was told that the menu pricing as posted online was incorrect.  Do not believe I will return, can buy a whole chicken at Costco for half the price."}
{"text":"They are the best roasted chicken I've tried in Vegas...So much flavor and the sides are mouth watering with a touch of homemade. The ribs barely need any extra sauce on top. I just recently found out this location is close to my wax salon so I will be visiting more often. Its off of the main road Rainbow that I drive by but they don't have any signs leading to it. Overall satisfing and finger licking good!!! Yum"}
{"text":"Quality ingredients, many healthy & delicious options. I wanna try everything on the menu. This place makes everything from scratch ~ Their friendly staff never sit still. Probably some of the best ribs & BBQ sauce I've ever had. I frequent the place! Follow them on Facebook for discounts."}
{"text":"Nico, nice to see a employer stand up for their employees, good for you.  There are so many choices in this city that it's very easy for customers to just move along to new and different places with better service, I'm sure it's a hard place to run a restaurant.  That being said I'll take your advice and start writing some five star reviews for the places I enjoy.(haven't really been much into writing reviews). This experience was such a downer that I could not leave it alone, thanks for your thoughts and I hope you've worked out some of the kinks in the service side of your place."}
{"text":"Very tasty chicken and good selection of side dishes.  Please bring Nevada Chicken Cafe to the Henderson area!!"}
{"text":"Great Chicken! (Most of the time)   My family and I have eaten here probably 5 times, and have always enjoyed the Chicken. I will say that it does seem very inconsistent, occasionally dry occasionally not. The sides are typically always fresh and delicious.  This time I finally decided to splurge and try the ribs I have seen every time, let me tell you it's called Nevada Chicken Cafe NOT \"Chicken and Rib Cafe\" for a reason!  These ribs were literally the toughest chewy inedible piece of pork I have ever had. Disappointing to have to waste a full rack and have a hungry family. The salad we got has amazing Cesar dressing but the lettuce was wilting and had black edges. This is actually the second time this has happened with the salad... unfortunately I believe this will probably be our last family meal from Nevada Chicken Cafe..."}
{"text":"OMG... the ribs and chicken combo was too die for! Found this place as it was listed in LVRJ as Terry Fator's go-to for bbq. They smoke their meats right outside the store in the parking lot and the smoky flavor wafts into your car as you drive in! Been hard to find a real bbq in Vegas but look no more! Let me get to the details. My husband and I split the sides we ordered: coleslaw and beans. The beans were outstanding and instead of serving a slice of bread with the meal, they served a fresh, warm tortilla to mop up your bbq beans! The chicken and ribs were moist and smoky and were seasoned so well you didn't need alot of sauce, which by the way is homemade and they took it right out of the pot to give us. Staff super friendly and made sure we were happy. Very reasonable prices as well. Just awesome."}
{"text":"Went for lunch yesterday with my wife and mother in law. I have been in the past and always been happy with the food. Today I had a chicken wrap and a Caesar salad. The salad was large and fresh and wrap was good. My wife had a quarter chicken and the mashed potatoes and gravy which she really enjoyed. My mother in law had the six wings and coleslaw. She enjoyed the wings and gave me one. I would say the wings are the worst thing I have had there. The sauce on the wings was a mediocre and the wings didn't have that nice crispy feel to them. The place is definitely worth a stop in but be aware that the place is small and gets very full especially during the lunch rush so make sure you try to get there a little early or a little later."}
{"text":"Last night the family and i went to this restaurant for the first time and i must say the food was AWESOME. We ordered the meal for 4 and everything came out to the table quick and well prepared. The staff was so helpful and nice that you cant help but like this place. Im not big on leaving reviews but with service like this i couldn't help sharing it with everyone. Thanks for reading my review and please stop by and see for yourself! Take care"}
{"text":"I had a christening and I called and placed the order with a very nice lady, I explained to her that I would not be picking up the order but someone else would and that I wanted to pay with a credit card in advance.  I gave her the number and I thought all was well.  Until my husband went to pick up the order and was told that he had to pay because it was company policy, the gentleman on the phone said he was the general manager for both locations and if so he needs to go back to customer service training.  He was rude and very unprofessional it's a shame that I can't use this company for the next 3 big events for my company and family, the food was great, but I won't work with a company that hasn't trained the supervisors to act accordingly.  :( so sorry I won't be recommending this place to anyone on just the poor communication and customer service alone."}
{"text":"Omg.. this place seriously  got me sick after i ate the chicken. It tasted a bit funky and i didnt eat all of it but i had to go to the bathroom many many times that same evening.  I will never  go here again.  I literally  had nothing  else that day. I had the food  here for lunch and was nauseous  by dinner time.  isnt the health dept supposed  to prevent stuff like this?  I mean obviously  not every restaurant  is  gonna end up being completely  sanitary.  So, that is why there is a  health  dept. I wish I  could  give  zero stars"}
{"text":"I got the most soggy order of chicken thighs. The chicken juice went onto my ribs and totally ruined the meal. The sides were barely decent.  It took a while for my order to get to me which was a hassle. I should of just went to chipotle next door but I go there too much and im tired of it. Lol    The price is the same as anywhere else.  Mediocre price but I def would not come here again. Totally soggy and low quality.  No wonder I go to chipotle so much lol"}
{"text":"The best grilled chicken and ribs in town.  Favorite sides are the chicken pasta salad and steamed veggies. YUM!!!"}
{"text":"I hate this place, yet I constantly go here because its the restaurant that sucks the least out of all venues in this neighborhood.   The first and most flagrant violation that this restaurant makes is that it is a blatant knock off of California Chicken Cafe. CCC is a very respectable chicken chain in southern california that does EXACTLY what Nevada Chicken Cafe tries to do, only 100x better, cleaner, cheaper, and more efficiently. The owner of Nevada Chicken must have gone into CCC, enjoyed his meal, and unintelligently figured he could replicate the same concept in Nevada. I would imagine that if one were to conduct their due diligence, the owner of Nevada Chicken has some personal ties to Southern California and i would imagine his credit card statements would show multiple purchases at California Chicken Cafe restaurants while he was conducting field research / concept theft.    Setting aside the fact that this concept is a ripoff of another restaurant, this place really sucks. When you walk through the doors you are greeted by the smell of stale chicken rotting into the cracks and crevices of banquettes and refrigerator vents. This place is incessantly filthy and you feel like you might get ringworm just by resting your elbows on the tables. How a restaurant manages to stay so filthy, so frequently is beyond me. God forbid you have to go to the 'salsa bar', you will see the remnants of weeks old chicken and tomatoes, salsa stained floors and sneeze guards, and rotting cucumbers. The tables always have old food on them and if you ask someone to clean the tables they'll look at you like you farted in their mouth.   This leads me to the main problem with this restaurant. The staff. Everyone that works at this restaurant seems to have been bludgeoned in the head with a pipe, bat, or brick at some point during their childhood developmental years. I dont typically venture to quick concept restaurants expecting rhode scholar employees to be serving me bbq chicken, but i do expect to pay for what i ordered, and I expect consistency when ordering the same thing twice. I guess the only thing consistent about this restaurant, is that they are consistently inconsistent. If you order an avocado wrap with a side caesar salad, and an additional side of roasted potatoes, you should anticipate receiving something like an avocado-less wrap with a side of corn and and extra side of macaroni. So if you go to this restaurant, make sure you proof read the food once it is handed over. If you do happen to get avocado on your avocado wrap, it will probably come from a premature avocado and your avocado will have the consistency of a frozen stick of butter. Nevada Chicken Cafe is REALLY good at serving un-ripe avocados. I've actually watched the desperate employee in the glasses grab a premature avocado and mash the poor thing on the counter top to try and soften it up so his knife could cut through the skin.   The food here is shit. All of it is bland.   The thing that is so disappointing about this place is that it would take SO LITTLE to make this restaurant good. The concept is so easy... its just chicken. Grill it, cut it, serve it, and dont screw it up. I think thats why I constantly go back. I figure, 'how can they mess this up? It must have been a fluke the last 100 times.' Screw this place. I'm finally done letting you ruin my meals. Fuck Nevada Chicken Cafe."}
{"text":"Chicken is almost always consistent. Juicy!! Better for it to be overcooked than under cooked. The sides are awesome. So many to choose from, so fresh. When you sign up , you get super deals online too. If you are in the area. a must try"}
{"text":"I love this place. The mesquite grilled chicken is always really good. The bbq sauce is good, not anything too special but tasty. The sweet potatoes are really good too, a nice alternative to a mashed potato, which my coworker loves theirs.   I quite like their sauteed vegetables and fresh fruit...they put more than just cantaloupe in the bowl, so I opt for this all the time. I didn't care for the spinach pasta with feta, it lacked flavor which surprised me.   All in all you can't go wrong with the chicken here, I can't wait for the one near my work to open. The ribs always smell amazing so one day I will have to venture outside the box and go for it."}
{"text":"I eat at Nevada Chicken 3 times a week I absolutely love the food and the service the restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly specially Andreia very sweet and friendly"}
{"text":"Good place for Healthy Fast grilled chicken and ribs. I suggest their Baby back ribs and Chicken. However they offer lots of other items such as wraps and salads. They have a impressive amount of fresh side choices. The service is fast and the food is fair priced. Good place to grab lunch but the surroundings don't make this a dinner option in my opinion."}
{"text":"Great chicken and rib combs which include a drink. Can't beat that!. Ribs are seasoned and cooked to perfection. Even though, the restaurant provides you with a secret sauce, you don't need any sauce. The secret sauce is sweet and tangy.   They have many interesting side dishes. The spinach and feta salad is perfectly blended. They have a wide variety of healthy menu choices including wraps. The cucumber salad is divine! You can find it in the free salad bar. It's sweet, salty, and sour taste plays tricks with your tongue.   Looking to cater an event? They will do it for you!"}
{"text":"We ordered the family meal. 1 slab ribs with chicken and 3 sides. Mashed potatoes w/gravy, roasted potatoes and fresh fruit. All were good. We especially liked the roasted potatoes. We ordered our ribs 1/2 with sauce and 1/2 without sauce. Both were really good. We loved the chicken wings that we ordered with our dinner. They were really moist, tender and very good. A big hot with the family. We will definitely be back. One more thing- the employees were very kind and helpful. Great place to take your family if you like BBQ."}
{"text":"Best(healthiest) chicken around!  The ribs are even better. Great sides friendly staff , very casual. I live in the neighborhood and can't resist, when I drive by. Check yelp for coupons and have twice as much!!"}
{"text":"Had the 1/4 ribs and chicken thigh and leg combo. Awesome good. Had to sit outside because no more booths available. Cucumber salad not good, a bit old. Saffron rice yummy."}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots. They have great rotisserie or mesquite grilled chicken and add one side dish and it makes a perfect lunch. Some sides I like are baked beans, broccoli pasta, coleslaw, sautéed veggies and garden salad. There asian chicken salad and house special salad are also very good. Great place for a quick healthy meal.  Had their ribs once but they were a little dry."}
{"text":"We had ribs and mesquite chicken. The ribs were the best I've ever had and I've tasted ribs all over this beautiful planet of ours. Definitely returning soon!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE THEIR RIBS AND SIDES!! The people there are always so nice! It is a bit pricey but worth it to us! We order here often! May not look like much but it's awesome!"}
{"text":"Was hungry and freeway was backed up. Came in to eat at another place then saw this place. Got greeted with a smile. Great customer service and food was great also! Ordered 1/4 chicken white meat and 2 sides. Im full and happy! Thanks Nevada Chicken Cafe!  Mr.Paul"}
{"text":"Not very impressed with this place. The place was empty only one or two diner inside. One lady infront of me waiting   for the cashier to count his cash. For a while he didnt even ackowledge our presence and after while still counting the cash, he said somebody will be with you, of course nobody came. He finally finished his business and took the orders.  He missed one of my order. No big deal. Now to the food, the chicken was very, very dry it took me a while to chew and swallow. The ribs were ok but not very tender. Btw while I was waiting for the guy to finish his cash counting, I have noticed the kitchen people only wore one glow while putting food into the display window. One guy had such a dirty fingernail it made me think, I cant believe he works in the kitchen with those dirty hands/nails, preparing food with only wearing one glove on one hand, what about the other hand with those dirty nails touching the food??  Maybe the manager needs to check the cleanliness of his employees. Specially the hands and fingernails or make them wear gloves on both hands while handling food."}
{"text":"Amazing ! Chicken is delicious and their mashed potatoes are to die for.!! My new favorite lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Great taste! Enormous assortment of side dishes. Love the cucumber salad. Only negative the radio is so annoying. It doesn't stay on the station and frequently is just fuzz. Asked friendly staff to tune or turn off but they are unable. Makes for an unwelcoming atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ribs were mostly fat and very rubbery, disgusting!!! The mesquite chicken had a great flavor but was so dry, it was like eating shoe leather. The sides we ordered were sub par as well.  VERY OVER RATED, do not waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Everything excellent , big portions, love their yams, bake beans, mashed potatoes, mac and cheese ,delicious salsa  bar ,specially their pico de gallo salsa with cucumbers . Staff is always friendly! Must try!."}
{"text":"After seeing this place countless times, I finally decided to stop in. I was skeptical, because I think it's hard to find good barbecue in Vegas.  I'm glad I stopped in, I had the pulled pork sandwich with the cucumber salad as a side, and I loved both! The sandwich was large, and sauced perfectly. The salad was surprisingly tasty, it's like sweet pickled cucumber slices and onions mixed. I'll definitely be back, and I can't wait to try the ribs."}
{"text":"I'm going there tonight for the 100th time.  NCC always has fresh food, and polite staff.  The Owner treats all customers very well.  There is no reason to complain.  Ribs and chicken are cooked to perfection.  Corn as a side dish is my favorite.  I recommend the Cafe highly!"}
{"text":"This place is highly disappointing . The food wasn't good at all , and way over priced !!!!!!!!The chicken And ribs I ate tasted like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for hours. My wife had a wrap and they left out some of the ingredients . Both of our Mac and cheese sides were cold . My wife also found a hair in her cucumber salad . They also started to mop right in the middle of our meal the whole place smelled like fabuloso . Not exactly what I want to smell while I'm eating . And last but not least not one employee was nice or smiling at all . We will stick to chipotle !!!! (Next door and our original choice ) gave it a shot !! We will not be back !!!!! One star only because I had to!!!"}
{"text":"We had the chicken and rib special and it was delicous. Everything was tender and juicy. The mac and cheese is good stuff. If you are looking for great barbecue, I recommend you give them a try."}
{"text":"If I could give this place less than 1 star I would. I'll start by saying that the man at register was rude from the beginning. I ordered  the 3 dark chicken plate with one side and  an additional 2 sides, he than gave me my cups. When I went to fill my drinks there was no ice and the Coke was out. So I kindly asked him if he could fill/replace my request and  with an attitude said \"ill be right over there okay!\" Blown away by the response and tone he directed towards me I patiently waited. Customers waiting in line behind us have already  got there food and I ask another employee if she could kindly change the Coke and said says \" okay\". 20 minutes later for 3 pieces of chicken and 3 sides the woman brings us our food outside and I ask her if we could have another set of silverware. With a very nasty attitude she said \" uh huh\". I still do not have my Coke. So I look down at my plate and I only see 2 pieces of chicken. I go to the counter and ask for another set of silverware and let him know my order is incomplete and he finally tells me the Coke is out to just grab one from the  fridge. He  follows me to our table to point out that the chicken was not cut, making it still a 3 piece meal. Portion wise to me there was only 2 but I guess he's the chicken expert. Fed up I take my plate to the counter and ask for a refund of my meal. He hands me my money for just the 3 piece and I walk back to our table and notice my sister no longer wants to eat there if only she was going to eat. We than walk up to the counter again and finally ask for a full refund. He grabs her sided lunges them in the garbage can. Pretty much I didn't want to eat there from the beginning and now I really have a reason to never go there again. What really got me was that an employee could be soo rude to a customer. I am in the hospitality industry and behavior like that left me speechless and left with a terrible experience. I left hungry, didn't get refunded my full amount and most importantly wasted my time at that establishment."}
{"text":"Great food at a reasonable price. The veggie soup is outstanding. Chicken and Ribs are as good as you would get anywhere.Ditto Mac Cheese. We enjoy eating outside on the patio. Nothing fancy here, just what bar b que should be. One thing is missing. Wine. They have beer and should ad wine."}
{"text":"Fresh and healthy options.  Lotsa fresh sides.  Quick service.  Great place to go for a quick healthy lunch"}
{"text":"Hands down the best chicken and ribs in Vegas! Great service, the restaurant is super clean and the food can't be beat!!"}
{"text":"10/10/15 Male who worked at the front was totally rude.  Said that they ran out of Ribs when clearly the people in front of me ordered the same thing.  Whatever.  If you don't want my money then I'll make sure no one else spends their hard earned money here.  AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS"}
{"text":"I wrote a previous review that was filtered, ha, ha.  The truth is not pretty.  I now question all of Yelps so called reviews,"}
{"text":"Amazing!  I cant say anything bad  about  the food in NCC. The Chicken and Ribs  are delicious inside and out.  Me and my friends  Will be going back for more :)"}
{"text":"We love the food here! Whenever we are in Vegas, this is a must go to spot. We normally have the chicken (jucy and so well seasoned). The wife always orders the Chicken Pasta side, and I'll order whatever I'm in the mood for at the time as they are all good. We have had the ribs as well, but the chicken is our favorite. Very clean, staff is really friendly and helpful. A big hello to Mike from his friends in Minnesota."}
{"text":"mmmmm...,,,,mmm... bad! This place was definitely not what a majority of my co-workers had described it.  How can you burn chicken that bad? Here are my ratings for their service:  Customer Service - 5 Stars Chicken Pasta - 1 Star (only because the chicken wasn't burnt) Mashed Potatoes - 1/2 Star (only for the effort)  I ordered the family 4 meal and it was terrible.  I was hoping to write a good review, but the chicken pasta was soaked in thousand island dressing.  Not a huge fan of thousand island sauce unless i can use it on my \"In & Out\" burger.    Mashed Potatoes? Sooooooo disappointed, they covered my mashed potatoes with gravy for me so when i got home it had all blended in together.  Husband was not happy.    Chicken was very bland in seasoning, but thanks to the charred areas, there was a burnt taste at least.    I wish I could say more about the place, but unfortunately \"this is all she wrote\"."}
{"text":"We came with high expectations, but left feeling it was nothing terribly special. The chicken was dry. Usually, I wouldn't ding a restaurant for chicken being dry as it is hard to get it just right. However, their business is chicken!!!"}
{"text":"The Chicken and Rib Combo is where its at. The ribs are absolutely succulent and the chicken is delicious. Once you add in the yelp coupon, its only $8 for a meal! How can you beat that?"}
{"text":"Gross. Dirty dining . Food was okay but the front was dirty, had a bowl soup that obviously isnt ordered much assume. It was horrible. Amost comical how bad it was (tasted or prepared) the soda machine was slimy and dusty The salt and pepper shakers look like they are from the 80s and haven't been cleaned or switched out since then Watched employee touch food with there bare hand and use the register I hope the back is cleaner than the front."}
{"text":"This place is horrible!  don't go here the service and food sucks.  My coworkers and I tried it out just the other day . First, I must say there customer service skills  were bad. The food was  warm and they failed to bring all of our orders out. They had totally forgot part of the order. Most of the workers were running around not knowing what to do. To make a long story short stay away from this place."}
{"text":"Food: It's good. It's not incredible, but it's definitely not bad at all. However, for the price, it's not incredibly worth it. Atmosphere: If you would like to hear the year 2007 over the sounds of your own family, this is the place for you. However, if you enjoy conversation, it's rather difficult to keep one. Overall: Good, but I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Those who rated this place less than 5 stars need to see a tongue doctor and get checked up. Seriously. Or do yourselves a favor and just cut your tongue off! Either that or you're simply too stupid to recognize good food. Because the chicken at NCC is one of the top 3 chickens I've had in my life!!! And that includes many many fancy and expensive places.  Will definitely come back again. and again. and again. and again....."}
{"text":"Great smell walking into the place. My girlfriend and her daughter both got the chicken and ribs with a side salad, I ordered the chicken chili. Food came out fairly quickly, and the first thing I noticed was the chili was spicy, but served barely warm. My girlfriend asked the woman taking her order if the meal came with a salad and she said it didn't, so she ordered side salads for her and her daughter; the meal came out with salads on the plate AND two more salads that she asked for (basically charged for 2 unnecessary salads). No complaints about their food whatsoever, I even tried a little of the ribs and chicken. The one thing I noticed was the customer area was sparkling, they had someone (sometimes 2 people) cleaning the dining area (you could smell the cleaning supplies a little too much), but I'd rather the restaurant be too clean than not enough.  Even though my meal wasn't hot, it is worth another shot sometime. I will be back again."}
{"text":"Had the 1/4rib, leg & thigh combo with mashed potatoes. The chicken was moist with a crispy skin which I really like. The ribs were a little dry which I covered up with barbecue sauce.  The sauce was pretty good with a tiny bit of heat. The mashed potatoes were nothing special. Daughter had a house special wrap. Nice size with all fresh ingredients. Some of the chicken still had the gristle attached which for my fighter wasn't good. She said she wouldn't go out of her way to order that again. Wife had the chicken chile bowl, not much chicken and it was more like bean soup than chile. If it had chunks of chicken instead of shredded maybe would have been better."}
{"text":"Ribs are delicious! Chicken is yummy! The staff is friendly and the sides are perfect."}
{"text":"Food is  excellent! Ribs fall off the bone and don't need BBQ sauce.   The cashiers are downright unfriendly and move at a snails pace.   Server drops food on table and takes off without seeing if you need anything.  The food will keep us coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service. Sylvia greeted me with a warm smile and took extra time to clean my table. I love this place."}
{"text":"Excellent as always. I tried the Chicken Vegetable Soup for the first time. Outstanding."}
{"text":"Waited more than 30min for my food, workers were in the back eating pizza, not well organized.."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place. Unfortunately I was disappointed. I got the combo so I can taste both of there main offerings, Chicken and ribs. It was weird the wing felt a little under cooked as the skin was not crisp but the breast was so dry. Then the ribs were ok, but had too much cartilage and not enough meat. The mash potatoes and gravy was ok. Guess I'll be still looking for a go to bbq spot."}
{"text":"We had been a customer for a while. We love the BBQ ribs and chicken. Now we don't even need to cook if we were to go to friends party since we can always order some food from the restaurant. The price is reasonable for the quality of food."}
{"text":"Worst meal I've had in Vegas!! The one on fort apache that is. Can't speak for Sahara. The chicken must have been old or something it was mushy and tasteless I ordered the chicken ceaser wrap and there was more tortilla than anything! I will never come back!! The staff didn't even care if you came or not, no wonder no one was there that should have been my first hint"}
{"text":"One of the best chicken and ribs in town! Mac and cheese and saffron rice as side! The burger is very good too, very moist!"}
{"text":"Chicken & Ribs are really good. This place is definitely worth a try. Portions are too small for the price. Specially the sides. My favorite thing from their place is their side of rice, wish it was more."}
{"text":"The only thing impressive about this cafe was the mesquite grill. I got the house chicken wrap with no sprouts and a side of mashed potatoes to go. It wasn't busy at all and the food took a while. But not only did it take a while, when I got home I realized my order was wrong. They got the house wrap right but it had sprouts and I was missing my side of mashed potatoes that I paid for. And oh, there were bones in my chicken wrap. Never going back. Note to anyone that does order to go: check your order thoroughly before you leave!!!"}
{"text":"Avocado chicken wrap was horrible  all tomatoes and tiny piece if chicken . Iwould not recommend it to anyone"}
{"text":"Worst service ! Ordered ribs to go but when opened at home, it was chicken !!!  Have to go back all the way  8 miles just to get my ribs. Turned out they messed up the order number and it was the supervisor who gave me the wrong order. So frustrating !!! Bad service. They should check to make sure  when they give the  customer  their order!!! This used to be my preferred baby back ribs but now this has changed. Just poor service!"}
{"text":"I was always recommended to come to Chicken Cafe. Food was great. Will return."}
{"text":"My heart was pumping when I saw smoky out door BBQ stand at the front of the cafe More exited when i saw how clean the place and see many choices of menus that will be my favorite.Service was OK.But first bite and second bite and after I tried all the dishes that we had ordered.Then I talk to myself .I think El Pollo Loco and KFC are better taste than this.To many places kept open and try their best to served fast food. Remember the recipes are very important.And the taste must be there.specially fast  food."}
{"text":"I drop by here once ina while and the whole chicken is always excellent. Sides are great too, but I usually just split a whole chicken with my brother and it fills us both up. The atmosphere isn't superb, but it's generally well kept and clean."}
{"text":"Great food with big portions and fast service! The chicken is so juicy and flavorful and their sides are all delicious. The portions are big enough that my husband and I usually split a 1/2 chicken with 2 sides. We've tried both the rotisserie and mesquite chicken and they're both delicious!"}
{"text":"This Is One Of My Favorite Places To Eat When Dieting And Eating Healthy. They Offer A Variety Of Choices From To Baked Chicken To Fruits & Salads. The Owner Nico Is Usually Inside Of The Jones Location Helping Out And Greeting Customers. I Have Been A Long Time Customer, Before Their Were Two Locations."}
{"text":"First time, great experience! Friendly staff and amazing food! Would definitely recommend Nevada Chicken Cafe and we will be back!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years, absolutely the best chin and ribs in Vegas. I tell everyone to come here. If you don't stop by here and eat you are truly missing out. Stop by the Arroyo location and say hi to Andrea she is the best, tell them TOM sent you :)"}
{"text":"I was surprised by the low reviews on here! Nevada Chicken Cafe is fantastic! It is one of our favorite places in town and has been for years! The chicken is fresh, tasty and fast. The prices are reasonable and there is almost always a deal to be had by following them on Facebook! We are so excited there is one opening on the southwest side of town!"}
{"text":"The BBQ pork sandwich was amazing.  Can't wait to go back and try more things on the menu."}
{"text":"We have visited NCC numerous times in the last couple of years. Unfortunately, they are often times hit and miss. While the St. Louis ribs are about the best around, the chicken is usually dry and some sides are overcooked. Location is not their best friend either, hidden away in a small shopping center, and if you don't have the exact address you'll easily miss it.   If you catch them on a good day, though, you'll probably enjoy it. Sign up on their website for emails and get the daily deals."}
{"text":"This is the spot. The BBQ is amazing and the atmosphere is chill. Fair prices, decent portions, friendly hard working staff. We'll be back---a lot!"}
{"text":"HANGRY!!! That's the word I'm looking for. I'm hangry ... Like a snickers commercial.   When I ordered the family size chicken and ribs that is supposed to come with a rack of ribs the girls told me they only had half a rack left for the night. I said ok if they could throw in some extra chicken.   Then I sat and waited over 30 minutes. While waiting I watched a female employee carry a wet shelf across the kitchen dripping the whole way. She saw it dripping and did nothing about it. She stood it up between a counter and cabinet just behind the register. Then slammed it into place with her butt. She must have seen the look on my face because she then sauntered back and forth swinging her hips like she was pretty proud of herself.   Another girl without gloves tossed a knife into the pile of meat a man was cutting and packaging.   And then there was the woman with the long pony tail flipping around without a net.   My personal favorite was the young lady who filled herself a side container of watermelon with her hand and then grabbed her purse and left. After watching her ungloved hand dig in the watermelon I wrote off one of my side dishes. My watermelon came out of the same container after her hands were in it.   Finally got my food and raced home starving. 3 ribs does not make half a rack. And I got the same amount of chicken I always get with this meal. There was no extra to compensate for the lack of ribs.   The Mac and cheese was good. The mashed potatoes were ok. But we threw the dirty watermelon away in the empty rib container ... Kinda like they threw away a regular customer tonight!!  The service has gotten worse each time I've been in over the past 6 months or so. There is a definite who cares attitude among the staff that there didn't used to be. I am horribly disappointed ... And still hungry ... $50 for dinner didn't fill 3 people with the missing ribs and now I have to cook after waiting half an hour for take out."}
{"text":"I ordered the 1/4 rack with the breast and wing combo and it was very good. The ribs were seasoned perfectly. You feel like you're at a cook out.  I would recommend this place for sure. Myself and my fiancé both ate for  under twenty five dollars and it was worth every penny. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Sweet ladies employees & great Chicken!  Best in Vegas hands down.  Will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"No worries, I saved the containers and intend to post a side by side picture this week. We'll let the consumers be the judge"}
{"text":"Order a half rack of ribs and thee side to go. With out drinks it came out fast and just under $30.00."}
{"text":"So, I have been a regular here for the past year or so since I moved near by.  My friend and I always ride out here and we have always had great service, the food is great, and it was our favorite spot... UNTIL tonight.  We went in and ordered our food.  My order was a little messed up, nothing major.  Didn't say anything because we assumed the guy at the register was new since we hadn't seen him before, and it was just a little mistake... But then, when he came to pick up our plates after we finished eating the same guy said, \"let me get this shit from ya.\"  And took our plates... That took us back a little bit.  Then, he came back and started to clean the tables behind us.  After he was done, he came up to us and another couple of guys sitting at another table and asked us to go because he was \"trying to get out of there.\"  This was at 9:30pm.  They close at 10p.  We got up, my friend was pissed.  I asked him \"Dont y'all close at 10?\"  He said, oh, \"you dont have to leave, Im just closing this section down because I have to get out of here.\"  We just walked out... He had all the chairs ontop of the table by 9:35p.  WTF?  We've never had such terrible service before.  The other guys that were sitting by us left and were like wtf? When they went outside as well.  We'll never be back.  I'm really sad at how the service has gone from stellar to completely horrible in such a short period of time of this location being here.... :("}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. Nice and clean and smelled like Bar -B-Q. Off to a good start. I Ordered a full rack, St. Louis style. with a side of Mac and cheese. I have had better Mac and cheese. A little to thin and not cheesy enough. Not a big deal , I came to eat ribs. I was very happy, large meaty rigs  that were tender and well seasoned. Cooked with a decent sauce that caramelized nicely with a bit of char especially on the tips. Worth the trip, folks were nice, going to be back."}
{"text":"After placing my to go order I waited over 25 minutes. At that point I had to leave. I approached the cashier and asked for a refund. The owner came over and said they had run out of (whatever it was?) and it would be ready shortly. I told him I had to leave. His response completely floored me he said \" would you act this way if you were at Chipotle\". I asked him what way? No response. Is this how you speak to customers? I left with my refund and went next door to Panera. On my way out he approached my car and said he apologized. I told him to keep his apology and what he said to me was absurd and rude.  Never had a chance to try the food and I for one will NEVER. The food may be delicious but not so much the service."}
{"text":"Love that the food was just as outstanding as the Sahara location. Mike and the Sahara team were also cooking! Great meal - just wish that they had the outdoor cooking ambiance"}
{"text":"I eat out seven days a week. The chicken is very good but they are small pieces compared to other restaurants that serve chicken. Would like to see more coupon offers."}
{"text":"Very good food and very friendly staff! You can't go wrong with the food here. Every time I come here and get greeted and feel welcomed in the store"}
{"text":"This place is IT! Reminds me of neighborhood BBQ's when I was growing up, The Food is great. The Cashiers are great, Sandra who always helps me is so polite and friendly. Good Vibes, Good Music and Great Food. I always have a pleasant experience, So I had to share. Thanks guys, your food is just like moms.."}
{"text":"I go here for the ribs and mac and cheese. I havnt found a better place for them. They're good and they're quick."}
{"text":"An absolute lunchtime obsession, I'm here at least once a week. Its impossible to ignore the delicious smell of BBQ chicken cooking as you approach Jones and Sahara, where this gem is tucked away behind the gas station. The cafeteria style set up is perfect for a quick lunch without tempting you to linger. Everything is fresh made onsite, including the BBQ sauce! The staff is quick but friendly and they keep the place clean despite the numerous customers licking sauce from their fingers.  I've only had the chicken, me and pork don't get along...but I hear the ribs are just as good. Not the cheapest place in town, but don't worry. The price you pay is worth it ($13 for 6 wings and 2 sides) and will keep you full.   Don't forget to stop by the condiment bar and grab a couple cups of their sauce...can you tell I adore the sauce?!?!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. The taste is unique.  The sides are full of flavor no matter what you get.  Just give it a try"}
{"text":"WORST FOOD EVER!!! EVEN A 1 STAR IS GIVING THIS PLACE TO MUCH CREDIT!!!! First time going there was a bone in our food, but we decided to give it a second chance. BIG MISTAKE!!!!! The pulled pork was dry and leather texture, impossible to chew. They replaced it with a chicken sandwich that consisted of bread and a couple small chicken pieces. I seriously  think a health inspector needs to stop by and check the food!! Honestly we would of had better service at McDonald's to say the least. 2 meals for $20 is bullshit when the food isn't even edible.!!!!!! NEVER WILL I  RECOMMEND  NEVADA CHICKEN CAFE!!"}
{"text":"Since our first visit, we've been to visit Chad the Chicken numerous times - average of once every ten days - and they have been consistent.  No disappointment.  This place is definitely on our \"keeper\" list. -- -- -- -- -- On the newly-established Nighthawk 100-point scale: 92."}
{"text":"I had been to the Sahara location before and was very excited to have a location closer to home.  I went there tonight and ordered half a chicken and a full rack of baby back ribs with 2 sides to go. When the girl charged me $39 I almost fainted, but  I hoped it would be worth the money. When I got home and opened the bags, my order was all messed up. Instead of a full rack of baby back ribs, they gave me 1/2 rack of dry St. louis ribs, the gave me an order of rice I did not order, and the chicken was completely dry, I mean, it was so dry we didn't even eat it. Last week I bought a chicken from Costco that was juicy and tender, unlike this overpriced dry stuff.  The only one winning is going to be my dog, who is the only one who will want to eat this chicken. I believe the girl taking my order didn't quite know how to take orders (after all it is a new location) and that's why I got charged so much. I will prob. Go tomorrow w my receipt (that is not itemized) to see if I was charged right.  Save your money and go to chipotle next door or buy a rotisserie chicken at the grocery store. The only plus is  that the location looked nice and clean."}
{"text":"Being a fan of the original location at Sahara/Jones, I was excited to see a second location near me.  When you first go inside you notice it's warm in there, which makes it uncomfortable.  Once you order, they deliver the food to you.  The person who delivered the food was pleasant, but she just put down the good in front of people without any clue who ordered what and quickly walked away.  After each delivery we had to go the food shuffle to correct the order.   The chicken was good, but it was warm at best.  My wife's ribs were tough and chewy.  She had a side of corn on the cob, which was also just warm.  When she asked for some butter, the employee said she would get some for her.  She came back with a side of tortillas?!?.  The salsa they had out also just tasted like plain tomato sauce, no seasoning at it.  It was gross.  I was so hoping the food would of been better, but I'll give it another try in the future.  Maybe it was the fact it just opened and the kinks need to be worked out."}
{"text":"Where there's smoke, there's Chicken!  You can see Nevada Chicken cafe from a few hundred feet away, as the smoke from their grills floats up to the clouds.  This place is perfect for a relatively healthy and quick lunch.  The prices are good, and it is a nice change of pace from many other lunch options.  Go with the half chicken, and a side of the cucumber salad.  The chicken is generally moist and well cooked.  The cucumber salad consists of tomatos, red onions, and a delcious grecian vinaigrette.    I've had the salads and wraps a few times, and yes I'll agree with other reviewers that the chicken can be dry, which is why I just stick to the basics.    It's located down the street from LVAC on Sahara, so if you're looking for a quick protein fix after a tough workout, stop by Nevada Chicken Cafe, and say thank you to you wallet, body, and taste buds."}
{"text":"Salads are huge! Friendly staff and comped my fountain drink. Food was decent, I'd go back."}
{"text":"Great new places for ribs and chicken.. Tender and great flavor.. Clean and friendly services.. Must try, especially those days you can't decide what to eat.."}
{"text":"2 stars for having a nice manager on duty and staff. But your wings suck out loud. Who wants to eat a bunch of flats with that tacky little tip on it."}
{"text":"The chicken and the ribs are down right slamm'n! Finger lickn yummy! So far the only side I like is the sauteed vegetables...staff pretty much ignores you the entire time your there...making less favorable to dine in.....but I by have to admit that I really don't care...lol...the chicken and ribs are surprisingly delicious!"}
{"text":"Whether you go to this location or the one on Sahara its always good and consistent. I always order the whole chicken which comes broken down and the ribs. Lots of side options hot and cold."}
{"text":"Nevada chicken cafe has probably the best chicken wings you can get in Las Vegas. their barbecue sauce is like no other. Their chicken pasta salad is totally awesome. manager Mike is also awesome as are all his employees"}
{"text":"Nevada Chicken Cafe is one of just a few places we like to eat. To all those who don't think much of NCC you have no taste in food. Nevada Chicken Café's food has NEVER been substandard. Always freshly made and the pulled pork sandwich is to die for. I love the chicken pasta salad and my husband likes the saffron rice. We especially like Mike who we get hugs from when we see him. We will continue to enjoy the food at NCC and the friendly staff! YUMMM! I'm salivating now."}
{"text":"Over priced  $58.00  ribs average.  chicken not as good as El polo locos sides are a joke in size dinner for 4.  Came with 2 ears corn  2 cups of mashed potatoes. Tablespoon of gravy on it.   There were only 3 of us no problem finishing it all. Shortest rack of ribs i ever seen. Chicken looked more the size of cornish game hen.  None of us are what u would consider big eaters. Oh forgot came with a Cesar sald.  Lettuce 4 tiny croutons and a teaspoon of grated cheese. . Sorry nevada chicken  Just calling it like it is. With 3 soft drinks"}
{"text":"This is very expensive for what you get....the chicken is good but don't get a lot. The macaroni n cheese is filled with butter no cheese taste. The Caesar salad was good but as with everything else, overpriced."}
{"text":"Don't even waste your time! instead, go to El Pollo Loco a mile down Rainbow."}
{"text":"Great service and great food!!!!  Your won't regret trying this Las Vegas must go to place!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The chicken is to die for. They were able to smoothly handle our party of 10 without any mistakes either. Salads are great, chicken was amazing, ribs have an amazing flavor. Will be frequenting this place."}
{"text":"Walked in and was greeted by a cashier who had obviously just started her job here. That's fine but I was disgusted by the fact that she had hickeys on her neck and her uniform looked like it hadn't been washed all week. The place had only been open 30minutes when I ordered so it's not like it was dirty from a hard day's work. She took my order and after waiting 10 minutes for my food I was told they ran out of buns. Who runs out of buns at 11am and then doesn't tell anyone? My bbq pulled pork sandwich was converted into a wrap. The meal overall was good. 2 stars for lack of employee cleanliness and no communication about food inventory."}
{"text":"I was brought here for lunch with the guys in the office.  It was worth the drive over.  I think I may have been at their other location years ago, but still didn't know what to expect.  Quick, casual BBQ.  For something quick, I'd recommend this over a place like Famous Dave's.  Had the combo, chicken and ribs.  Good intense flavor.  Mac and cheese side was pretty tasty too.  I'd come back."}
{"text":"(11-15-15 2:30pm) This place is okay... The service isn't too friendly at the cash register (she looks like she hates her job lol) the chicken taste like you can BBQ it at home, the ranch taste like Its from a Krafts bottle, and the mashed potatoes taste like they're from a box even though they have potato skins in it. For give for sounding so harsh and rude but basically what I'm saying its kind of a waste of money. There's really nothing new here. But if you're hungry, and don't care spending about $9.95 for something you can make at home, buy all means who's stopping you ."}
{"text":"I will never get tired of coming here. The ribs are so good! I've been wanting to try the chicken but the ribs for now it's all I want lol the rice and beans is very good! The little salad and tortilla are good as well! Delicious. The owner is very nice too! Great staff! Fast service!"}
{"text":"I liked this place. It was pricey but the food was good, the ribs especially! Now I usually make my own pork ribs, and I know what I'm talking about. So to be handed a plate of juicy, meaty, DRY-RUBBED ribs roasted right outside in (or very near) the parking lot and Sahara Avenue, well that blew me away. The chicken was alright too, but I will say not as good as EPL. But to be fair, EPL, corporate machine or not, has the best chicken around. The meal, which was over 12 bucks for a few ribs and a piece of chicken, came with a salad and a side. I got the beans. Yum.  I would come here again, but I'd have a coupon to offset the price, and I'd stick to the ribs. I love that It's a little local shop, and hope they can take into consideration the fact that not everybody can drop $12 bucks on lunch. You'd think with the Sahara and Decatur El Pollo Loco just minutes away, they'd at least try to be a little more price-competitive.  If I had to choose, I'd go to EPL every time and have money left over to go across the street to the other corporate giant for a Orange Mocha Frappaccino for desert."}
{"text":"Mediocre. Ordered a custom salad. Salad maker didn't know the difference between cilantro and parsley. So I ended up with a big pile of pungent parsley on my otherwise decent pile of veggies. Grilled chicken atop the salad was a let down. Good portion, but zero seasonings on it and no grill marks in sight. Reminded me of a plain ol' baked chicken breast. I'm in no hurry to go back."}
{"text":"This is a small place with a cafeteria feel.  The good news is that the food was delightful. The bad news is that the service is underwhelming.   The cashier clearly  was not happy to be there and there was quite a bit of bickering among the staff.  Ordered a pulled pork sandwich, chicken chili and a half rack of ribs.  Good: Portion sizes are large. Pulled pork was juicy and flavorful. Chicken chili rocks and the coleslaw was excellent.  Bad: The mashed potatoes were not flavorful and the ribs were dry.   Overall.  Nice place and we would come back.   We recommend that you get your staff to focus more on customer service.  (See pictures of chef flirting with staff member as customers were waiting)"}
{"text":",staff are working hard,place is clean;i ordered 1/2chicken and its so tasty and yummy husband and i are enjoying our meal!!!!its worth it!probably will come back again!!!buuuurrrrp!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch... chicken sandwich had flavor and moist. Clean atmosphere very friendly staff The lady at the register didn't know it but her positive energy made my day better"}
{"text":"Love this place! We discovered on accident but are really glad we did.  The ribs and chicken are delicious and all of the sides are really fresh."}
{"text":"Dry rub on the chicken and ribs is amazing. The homemade sweet bbq sauce is also awesome. Prices may seem a bit high, but I'm willing to pay for homemade and fresh. It's fair if you consider everything involved in the process of cooking these meats with such phenomenal flavor. I'm also a huge small business fan. The smell from Sahara and Jones literally lifts you up like a cartoon and carries you to their restaurant. If you've never tried Nevada Chicken Cafe, you're missing out on a local gem. For sides, the mashed potatoes, roasted potatoes, fruit and salad are good."}
{"text":"Mouth watering melt in your mouth chicken and ribs both flavors mesquite and rotisserie. And their mashed potatoes to die for and great personal service"}
{"text":"I have come here a few times and I have always been beyond satisfied, the food is always fresh, the service is always great, and the taste is unbeatable with reasonable prices. The salad/dressing bar is always kept clean and fresh (something you don't see in this town these days). They have outside seating with really nice decor that I also like a lot. The menu is large, something for everyone and they also serve a variety of beer which was a big plus for me. I would recommend everyone try this place out for lunch or dinner, I think they deliver as well."}
{"text":"This place is really good. Don't get delivery, this food you wanna get it hot and fresh. I've lived by this place 10 years and never went until a friend took me. Now I go twice a month. The restaurant is small so going at peak times wouldn't be recommended but who gives a crap, cause if you want good food then you'll just have to deal with it. Sides are good, salads are decent, the ribs are great. Go there your self and tell me I'm wrong."}
{"text":"The guys here at this location are pretty cool. Easy to start a conversation as well as recommend something good. The wings are delicious as well as their ribs. Being able to take it home to eat with the family is awesome as well. :)"}
{"text":"I have been a loyal customer of the Original store on Sahara and Jones for years because of the great food and friendly atmosphere.  Nico has it figured out and has effectively married a great menu, a dedicated and hard working staff, and a friendly atmosphere to create a spot that not only offers delicious food but makes it a pleasant eating experience. The menu is fantastic!  I love the ribs and rotisserie chicken.  It takes some time to order because the choice of sides is so large and every one is great.  Everyone I bring for the first time returns again very soon and always bring others with them.  The food actually becomes habit forming. For chicken, ribs, and a great variety of side dishes there is nothing better!  Customers forever!  Fred & Genevieve Brown"}
{"text":"I like that they use organic chicken.  That's a big plus for me.  The chicken is a solid 4 stars in my book but the ribs are 3 stars.  So, I guess this place falls somewhere around 3.5 stars.  Service is friendly and relatively fast.  The food is always fresh though and it's a nice place to go for a relatively healthy lunch."}
{"text":"Started going to Nevada chicken café after meeting the owner, Nico, (super nice guy) several years ago and I typically love this nevada chicken cafe. Asked for them to serve some fresh Mac and cheese today since the Mac and cheese had obviously been sitting on the hot bar, uncovered for sometime and was half depleted . They refused, so I refused to give them my business. Super disappointed in Nevada Chicken Cafe staff today. Definitely has changed my perceptions of this establishment."}
{"text":"First let it be know I do not like BBQ sauce.......that being said I really like the  ribs that have the rub not the sauce. My husband like the chicken and mashed potatoes. All the sides are just okay. Also I wish I could just order ribs solo. Only chicken comes solo or as a combo. Yet I still crave this place......so give me just ribs as an option please, then you'd be a 4 Fo Sho!"}
{"text":"Update: I've been back twice and the wait time was much better. Great food, just like the other locations.   I've attempted to eat lunch at this location twice, because it's so close to my office and I love the Rainbow/215. I waited in line for over 10 minutes both times and walked out."}
{"text":"This is an update to my review and response to the owner.  Nico:  Hi Jasson: My name is Nico and I am the owner of Nevada chicken Cafe. First I would like to thank you for your review and honesty. I would like to invite you back to my place to make sure you will get the quality and service you deserve. Please ask for Nico and I make sure you will be taking care from my employees. Again sorry for your bad experience and looking forward to see you soon.... Jason G.  A moment ago  Me: The only way you could improve is as I suggested.   1. Service 2. Seats that can support a child ( bare minimum ). 3. Try a light brine with your chickens, \"dryness\". 4. Just make your sides buffet style, because they won't improve.  P.S. I won't be back... you're lucky you don't have a lawsuit!, My little boy received a decent sized bump on his head and I am sure a nice headache to sleep off that night.  You can improve such as I have stated,  and by spelling my name right, and using better English grammar or that may be why your seats break in the first place... low attention to detail.  I sir have a very HIGH tolerance to many things but, when my siblings get hurt EVERY poor details comes to light. Just let old dogs lay, take your licks, and count your blessings.  Old review:  First time there chicken for both me and my wife was dry... Sides were fruit salad and limp cucumber salad could have made it better at home for less.  Second time back we gave it a second chance this did not happen however, we waited behind some happy people trying to figure out what to order for over 10 minutes while the line behind us backed up.  We finally had our chance to order after noticing 2  people coming up asking where there lunches were.  We took our table it was me, my wife and my 2 year old son...my son feel through the seat down to the floor while I in shock I quickly pulled him out while he began to cry turned to the front counter girl and demanded a full refund ($28 ) and left, I will never be back. They let people sit in broken seats? I doubt there chicken has improved they could improve there service by making the sides ALL buffet style as they are CHEAPLY MADE anyway."}
{"text":"This is probably the best experience I had in Vegas with my kids.  The young man on Saturday was so very kind and understanding with my 9 year old autistic son.  As you know , children with special needs do not like change or to try anything new. However - the cashier ( I had to ask his name ,Will ) spoke to my son, so kindly. My son calmed down and ordered the chicken and rib combo. If I wasn't so stressed , I would have remembered to take pics. Next time, I promise.  My son now has a new favorite place to eat, when we come from LA to visit family!!  Thank you so much Will, for your hospitality and kindness. Not to mention the food was really good too. My son told me to tell everyone get extra mash potatoes-- they are awesome"}
{"text":"Absolutely will never go back here again. Terrible service & Quality. The manager lost a regular customer because he was a complete asshole & called me telling me I'm wrong! I opened my meal looking like this meal & told I had bbq sauce when he was completely wrong! He told me I could come back for 2 pieces of chicken but no sides or the meal I ordered in the 1st place! Dry potatoes with barely any gravy, cold sweet potatoes, & nasty Mac & cheese! Worst quality & worst service while listening to them sweat & talk about their personal lives!"}
{"text":"Although this place has been around for quite awhile my first time going was today and the chicken and ribs were seasoned so well! They have a blueberry barbecue sauce that's to die for,and kudos to you Silva for being so pleasant !"}
{"text":"The food is decent, but I have a huge problem with their online ordering service. My girlfriend, from home, ordered the family meal online. When I got off of work I went to pick up our food.   When I got there my food was ready early (I was happy about that) they told me the total was 53 and some change. So I gave them my card to charge the 53 and change. They handed me my copy to sign and I added a decent tip. Left the store got home to find out that my girlfriend had already charged her card and added a tip to the amount with the total of her charge being 53 and change after tip.   So they charged me for the total of 53 plus my tip and didn't say a word about the tip already being included. We weren't double charged but it's upsetting that they didn't tell me or show on my copy of the receipt that there was already a 20% tip added.   Moral of the story is keep an eye out when ordering from this place online."}
{"text":"One of best places to eat chicken in town with great sides. Relaxed atmosphere. Would come here again."}
{"text":"I'm writing this and I haven't even tasted the food yet. Poor service = unrecoverable in my book. This was the first time I have been to \"Nevada Chicken Cafe\". The experience was nothing special. I spent about 10 minutes in line at the lunch rush and was never greeted until I got to the register to briefly order for 60 seconds and sit down to wait for my food. I brought my \"3 piece meal\" back to my office to discover they only gave me 2 pieces of chicken. Thanks Nevada Chicken Cafe - I am sure it is a great way to reduce cost by shorting orders. How do you literally F that one up. There is nothing in the box but chicken!? The reciept shows 3 and there isnt even an option for 2 pieces on the menu. What idiots are working there? My advice? If you don't care about poor general service for food you could just make at home - go ahead and try it - but check your order.  and for the chicken? well, nothing your average 8 year old couldnt overcook on your backyard grill."}
{"text":"I have never had any problems with Kentucky chicken before but after trying the Nevada chicken cafe I realized I've been missing out on some damn good chicken. Every time I drove by the area I could see the smoke coming from the restaurant but it wasn't until my friend, an expert on smoke signals, convinced me to try it and the rest is history.... I inhaled, now I'm hooked. They have more than chicken, they also serve BBQ ribs and a great variety of sides, sandwiches and salads. We ordered a whole chicken to go and ate it at home with some homemade sides from previous meals that we already had, the chicken was moist and very flavorful it went great with just anything.  I have a feeling I will be stopping here for chicken every time there's a potluck, family, or friends gathering... nothing wrong for taking credit for good chicken! Totally recommended, so next time you find yourself on Sahara and Jones make sure to follow the smoke, you'll find no gold at the end but you'll find some of the most friendly people, wonderful service and some great food!  You'll  be also supporting a local independent business and that's one ingredient that makes everything more satisfying!"}
{"text":"To be completely fair, this is my 3rd visit to this spot since it opened.  The first 2 times were higher than the 2-star marks for sure.  The food quality and service was great and the restaurant is very clean and inviting.  Today, the latter 2 were both true.  Nice cashier and still a clean and friendly place to visit.    The unfortunate part came with the meal.  Me and my lunchmate ordered 2 wraps.  Both came out looking very nicely presented.  When we took the paper off, the wraps both completely fell apart with ingredients and sauce all over the outside and falling out of the back.  It was actually embarrassing trying to eat them.  We ended up dissecting them on the plate and knife & forked them most of the remainder of the meal.  That's an issue that can be overlooked...maybe only a start loss for expectations being missed.  What killed the other stars for me was about 3/4 way through my 'open faced' chicken wrap, I got a mouthful of lovely crunchy chicken bones.  To add to my embarrassment of the sloppy mess I tried to manhandle, I got to spit an entire mouthful of chewed food into my napkin like a 4 year old.  At that point, both of our appetites were completely destroyed.    It only takes one bad experience to ruin a restaurant for me.  Especially when the establishment sharing a common wall with this one delivers quality and service that's expected every single time.  And they apparently have a much better manual entitled, \"How To Effectively Wrap Food in Tortillas\".    Sorry to rain on the parade...I had high hopes, but they've been thwarted.  :("}
{"text":"For my fellow low carb people, this is the best place in town, hands down. You have to try the chicken and ribs combo, seasoned to perfection. I have to warn you though, it's very addictive."}
{"text":"What kind of business are you guys running...running customers away. ...you guys are certainly doing a great job at that. I got a coupon in the mail and wanted to use it and the manager won't allow it and can't explain it to me why I can't use it? ...well...since you guys don't want my money ...I will spent it somewhere else..bad business ethics! Never coming back!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this place for lunch..the enticing smoke from the rotisserie grill called my name. It was hustling and bustling, which is usually a good sign. Order the 1/2 pound chicken and one side of mac n cheese (it was so tasteless exchanged it for cole slaw). The food wasn't bad but there was nothing special. I left feeling unsatisfied and wanting a whole rotisserie instead from Costco."}
{"text":"Well I took my girlfriend in there for the first time tonight we ordered two half rack of ribs mashed potatoes and gravy and potatoes the food was excellent the atmosphere is clean and we were watching a football game that was on TV and had a very enjoyable evening my girlfriend was very impressed with the food and she says he will be back again myself I've been to your establishment five to six times within the last 2 years."}
{"text":"Can't say enough great things about Nevada Chicken Cafe! The foods is always fresh, hot off the grill and cooked to perfection! Juicy chicken and ribs, seasoned well, best in town! Great selection of sides too.  Fresh and crisp salads, creamy mac and cheese, too many to mention. The owner, Nico, is always so accododating and a pleasure to see every time we go in! Must check this restaurant out, you will become a regular!!!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. I've been here 2 times. The first time I got the BBQ chicken sandwich with veggies and mashed potatoes. All of it was super flavorful and I used the yelp checkin coupon which made it under $6.   The second time I had the pulled pork sandwich with Mac and cheese (which was a little like the boxed kind) and the veggies again. Again, though everything was very tasty. Service is a little slow but the taste of the food makes up for it.   Oh, and don't forget to try the pico de gallo on the condiment bar .... Surprising little treat."}
{"text":"Love all the Nevada chicken cafes! And this one is no exception. The cashier was extremely friendly and was apologetic when he had to answer some phone orders. He also gave me extra credit on my epoxy app!"}
{"text":"Walked into this place with high hopes of a great meal but in the end that was not the case. I waited a while to get helped at the counter as the cashier was on the phone doing an order and was juggling two calls. She eventually called another cashier over who began taking orders. I got the two piece white meat and rice, the chicken was dry and didn't have too much flavor but the rice was actually pretty good. This was my first visit here and really wanted to like it since its down from where I work but I am in no rush to return here, will probably try again in the future."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is amazing!  The staff is friendly and the food is absolutely delicious. I found myself a new favorite spot to visit."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed the ribs and chicken. Its like backyard cooking without the clean up and preparation. If only they served burgers from that grill I'd be here every week. One star missing because the ribs should be baked or boiled before grilling so the meat falls off the bone.  They aren't tough,but not as tender as one would like either. The sides such as mac and cheese and potato salad were delish! Everything just tasted gimmick free and straight forward. It's hard to find that in Vegas. Why was there a tortilla in my to go box?"}
{"text":"We've been here several times and are always pleased with the food!! When we go on Saturdays, we get the chicken and rib special and have never been disappointed! The Mac n Cheese is amazing, too. We'll be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Ordered half a chicken white meat to go and it was $10 dollars, They cut a good size chunk of chicken out of the chicken breast for no reason beyond \"that's what they do.\" The restaurant didn't supply silverware with the order and they gave one quarter of a flour tortilla. What in the world am I supposed to do with that?!?! The guy behind the counter tried real hard to upsell me on sides and came off like an oily car salesman. After getting my food home I discovered several long black hairs in and around my chicken...GROSS!!!!  I love supporting local business, but this was a terrible experience for mediocre food. If they ever post a sign saying \"Under New Management,\" then I might give this place another chance."}
{"text":"First time trying this place! I was craving rotisserie chicken, and bought the $20 for $10 yelp deal. I got two combos with ribs and chicken. The ribs were in a delicious sauce, and they were tender and juicy and not overcooked. The chicken, however, was dry. It had good seasoning, but the dryness ruined the chicken for me. That was very disappointing, since that is their main item. I would go back for the ribs, but definitely not the chicken."}
{"text":"I ate here on the advice of a co-worker. The price was decent and the good was good. A bit smokey walking into the business as you pass by the outside grills. Overall a fair meal for a fair price."}
{"text":"This is the only location I like because the bbq their chicken outside on a real wood charcoal grill, so u have that real bbq taste!! Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Great location, clean and open space, and the food is awesome!  This location maintains the same quality as their other locations. A great value to be sure!"}
{"text":"We had driven past this place a few times, always promising to visit it, and finally did. When you walk in the smell was amazing so we had high hopes for some good BBQ and weren't disappointed! I read the reviews about rude employees but the lady at the front was so nice and helpful with the menu. We had the pulled pork & BBQ chicken sandwiches both were delicious! The Mac n cheese could have used more \"cheese\" flavor but other than that we couldn't complain. Our picky 2 year old daughter loved the food as well! Hopefully people will give this place another chance!"}
{"text":"This was quite possibly the best chicken I have ever had!!! I also tried the ribs which were fantastic!! And finally, topped it off with a side of fruit...real fruit!!! Awesome!! Will return for sure!!"}
{"text":"My first visit to this location was actually on their opening day. The first 50 customers received a $50 gift card and I was fifth in line! LOL!   When I crave for fresh grilled chicken, this is where I want to be! Their chicken cooked over mesquite charcoal is truly an amazing  treat! The spices used on their chicken blends in well with the added flavor from the smokey mesquite charcoal. This surely takes it to the next level!  My usual order is their 3 piece dark meat - with additional charge of sides, rice and mixed vegetables. I always request for BBQ and Ranch sauces to dip my chicken in.The chicken is always tender and moist. The red rice is seasoned well. Prices are decent and the service for me is always great.   I like the simplicity of their menu items: 2 meat options  Hot and Cold sides Salads and Wraps 2 types of Sandwiches  Wings, Soup, Desserts Family Meals, Combos"}
{"text":"It was ok. Maybe it would have been better if I didn't go at 8 at night time because BBQ usually dries out by then but none the less it was mediocre at best"}
{"text":"I got the Hawaiian wrap w fruit salad and my fiance got the mozzarella wrap w mac and cheese. I thought my wrap was good, lots of flavor. My fiance was not a fan. His wrap was suppose to have balsamic and olive oil but instead had some sort of creamy dressing, maybe the house dressing? He said his mac and cheese tasted microwaved."}
{"text":"The chicken is good. I didn't like this spot at first but went back again yesterday and they stepped it up. But for the service part is what they really need to work on. That's about it. I'll be back tho bc the chicken is that good!"}
{"text":"For lunch we decided to check this place out. We walked in and there was a menu above the cashier where you order.   I ordered chicken mozzarella wrap with potato salad and a drink. I got pink lemonade to drink. After we placed our order, you grab your number with your drink cups. After getting my pink lemonade, hubby got a table outside since it was full inside. It was a nice day to eat outside anyway.  After 10 or 15 minutes, our food was delivered to us. I took a bite out of my chicken mozzarella wrap and there was more lettuce and dressing in my wrap. There were only a couple slices of mozzarella and some chicken. It was descent but I would rather have less lettuce and tomato than chicken or the mozzarella. The potato salad was delicious. The best item out of my meal. Potato salad was filled with flavor such celery, onions, and potatoes were cooked well.   There is no table service but they clear your table for you after you finish eating. There is a tip jar in front so be sure to tip. Parking is limited but there is parking in the back."}
{"text":"I know this place has been around for a while, owners are very nice. They have a special license that allows them to cook outside, using a mesquite grill. In which not many places in the Las Vegas Valley have. I had a the 1/4 ribs combo and 1/2 chicken. Chicken was seasoned well, not really juicy, but that was expected because it was grilled on open flame. I had the baby back ribs, they were dry rubbed. Not fall off the bone juicy and tender but they were good. The house dipping sauce was as good as it gets. I couldn't explain it, that was definitely the highlight of the meal. I would go back just to get ribs with that sauce again. I was a little disappointed they ran out of roasted potatoes, so i opted for the saffron rice, instead. It was okay, came with a house spring mix salad, with balsamic dressing and a flour tortilla. With a drink it came out to 10.50$. A fair price. I want to go back and try some other sides, The food presented well, served on a wooden chopping board looking plate, a great touch. It was during lunch rush that I came in, and food came out fast and great tasting. That is a great indicator that the owners are doing something right."}
{"text":"Can we say YUMMY!!! Wowzers! This place was a surprise and so great!   1. Start on right side and work towards cashier lol  2. Lots to choose from. I chose the 3 piece dark and chose 1 side. My honey had the 1/4 rib rack and Breast. FABULOUS!  3. Choose Mesquite Charcoal...think El Pollo but tastier  4. BBQ Baked Beans were perfect  5. Meals come with salad & tortilla. Perfect addition.   6. Very inexpensive. ALL THIS and a Perrier bottle and fountain drink for less than $20 for 2.   7. We will be back again to try the rest which includes:  wraps, sandwiches, salads, wings, family meals & soups!  PS:  Guy at cash register has a great voice! You'll know if it's him by his awesome voice!"}
{"text":"This is the best BBQ I've ever had. I keep coming back day after day just to get the whole menu. The sandwiches are fantastic and the meat is tender and juicy. The garlic ranch dressing is good on just about anything."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Ate there a couple times a week. Last time my son and I ate there two nights in a row. My son had the pulled pork sandwich with mash and Mac the first night. I had a salad. Everything was delicious. The second night, we both had the pulled pork sandwich, Mac n cheese, and fresh fruit. Within two hours we both had major stomach aches with extreme bloating and painful gas. This lasted a good four days and left me with a bladder infection. We suspect the fruit. Can't bring ourselves to go back."}
{"text":"The sweet potatoes are excellent. Great value. Can't go wrong with either the chicken or the ribs. I had both."}
{"text":"The chicken here is healthy fresh and flavorful just like the menu says. I had a small issue that the owner helped me out with...no problem...no questions asked. That is hard to find now days. Excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"I've tried the rotiserrie chicken and the asian chicken salad.  The chicken was a little dry for a place that focuses on it.  The asian  salad was inedible because they put so much parsley on top of it that I couldn't taste anything but the parsley.  I am not sure if they were using it as a garnish or an ingredient - either way, it ruined the salad (which would have been good without it)."}
{"text":"Come see mike, great bbc and incredible service. The hands down best potatosald and some of the best chicken chill soup around."}
{"text":"It's chicken... The service is mediocre, the staff is not friendly and frankly its similar to el poyo loco (sp). I had a chicken avocado wrap (probably my first clue) that should be named the avocado chicken wrap with a fruit salad. I am attempting healthy. The fruit, while fresh was must have been cut from the same knife as the chicken because it tasted the same. Unfortunately the wrap was loaded with everything but an ample amount of chicken, which was bland. I will say that Ordering their grilled chicken is better.  But the lack of friendly service and a congested location will keep me away for a while."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!!!! I waited 10 minutes on the phone to place an order. I was then told that they were super busy and my order would be ready in 30 minutes. I had no problem waiting 30 minutes considering I still needed to drive there, but when I arrived I had to wait another 15 minutes in line just to get to the counter to pay and was told that they couldn't make half of my order because they ran out of potatoes!!!!  After somewhat of a sorry, I paid and ended up having to go another restaurant to get more food so I could have a complete meal. By the time I finally got home.....everything was cold!!!!"}
{"text":"Andrea was the best server ever she took my order good no mistakes  Great job guys keep it up"}
{"text":"FIRST TO REVIEW!!  Came here for lunch on opening day. This place is legit and absolutely delicious, but expect to be in a food coma afterwards.  The setup inside is very similar to the Chipotle next door. Tortilla maker up front and all the food prepared before your very eyes.   I ordered the chicken and ribs combo. After you order you go over to the drink station where you are greeted by tons of BBQ sauces and what nots. The cucumber salsa thing is really good.  The chicken was moist and tender, as were the ribs. Not fall off the bone, which is what prevented this from being a 5 star joint. I prefer fall off the bone.  Bathrooms are clean and safe to use.  I'd def come back."}
{"text":"Best ribs I've ever eaten.  very meaty and not smoked. Barbecued to perfection.  Fairly priced, I've been back six times. Never disappoints"}
{"text":"Food is mediocre. What's troubling is the abundance of flies. There's a dumpster next to the restaurant that is a haven for flies which fly into the dining area. They need a door vent to keep bugs out. By the end we were grossed out from eating and swatting/killing flies at the same time. Never afa"}
{"text":"What a great find!  Great food, wonderful friendly service!  This will be our go to chicken place.  Everything tastes so fresh and healthy.  You have to try the mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"They were very nice very friendly the ribs were ok the chicken was okay the food was just okay"}
{"text":"You know, the place just opened. I tried it closer to opening day and I had checked yelp then before going in, and the reviews were really mixed. When I had gone in, it seemed a bit chaotic and the people working there were obviously trying to get a handle on things. The food wasn't bad then, and it's even better now! They are really turning things around now. They must be getting into the flow of things, because my food was even more amazing, as it should be, not dry at all like some other reviews depict it to be(although things change between one cook to another I'm sure!). I'm giving it four stars instead of five, because they still need some work to get things top notch. I'm sure as time goes on they will improve and I will review it again then!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place out today and I have to say it was amazing! Great price with a lot of food. The staff was very friendly. I will be coming back fersure and definitely having some friends come along."}
{"text":"Our first time coming here and we enjoyed it. We got our monies worth. Good customer service from all the staff. Thank you."}
{"text":"Another great catered meal from NCC. This time we had the chicken and ribs, Mac and cheese, potato salad, sweet potatoes, and green salad. Hot food was hot and cold sides were cold.  Very affordable and you are given plenty of food.  The catering side of the restaurant thinks of everything including decorations for the buffet tables to give the party a festive look."}
{"text":"I don't eat a lot of meat,  but really chowed down some ribs here.  So good, the best ribs here that I have tried."}
{"text":"The half of chicken is not worth price. Was three pieces of chicken for 14 dollars and 3 sides.  Just go to the grocery store and buy a whole rotisserie chicken."}
{"text":"The pulled pork sandwich is so good I inhaled it and unfortunately didn't get to fully enjoy it. But def ordering again"}
{"text":"This place is great going here for years very good very nice fast service always consistent!"}
{"text":"Their Ribs are the best in Town..    I have been to both locations and not once have they disappointed."}
{"text":"Went to the Nevada Chicken Cafe off of Rainbow Blvd. for dinner with my friend. I was unfortunately disappointed with this location. First of all it was SO NOISY!!!! The music that was playing was so loud I thought I was in a club. I couldn't even hear the cashier & talking to my friend was almost impossible. There was a couple of minutes between the albums & that was a nice rest. Then it started again.   The food wasn't as good as the Sahara location. We both got a combo rib & 1/4 chicken dinner. This time the ribs didn't fall off the bone & it was kind of dry. I had to slather the bbq sauce to make it \"wetter\". The chicken was good but, you could tell that it wasn't as fresh as the first time I ate at NCC. I got a corn on the cobb again but, it was hard as a rock. I had to slather the butter on it to eat the cobb. The last time I didn't even need butter it was so good.   The bus person cleaned all of the dirty tables but didn't even touch our dishes tbat were clearly done. I guess I'm being picky, being in the f & b industry but I hate a dirty table & always try to clear dishes to make room for my guests. I don't get why she didn't do that.   I left a 20% tip with the cashier & absolutely no thank you from the cashier who saw me leave a good tip. It's pretty sad that employees have no personality & have no grace to say thank you. After all Tips aren't guaranteed.  I will be going to the Sahara location instead of the Rainbow location from now on."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken Caesar wrap with a side of the red potato salad and it did not disappoint. The wrap was flavorful and inexpensive. I dined in and the establishment was clean and maintained. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"After seeing the dancing chicken out front for the millionth time I finally decided to try this place.  Dang it's good!!  The chicken is better than the ribs and in my opinion the half chicken and rib combo is a great first timer order.  Do stop in and try it as it is a short drive off the strip and well worth it!"}
{"text":"Second visit, this time to pick up lunches for a few of us at the office.  NCC offers online ordering for pick up or delivery, but I like the lunchtime energy of the place, so I did my ordering the old fashioned way--in line.  My boss liked his chicken caesar salad, said the greens were fresh, the chicken breast very tasty.  We girls had the half slab each of baby back ribs, seasoned with a great rub which made the ribs deliciously tender.  Finger licking goodness. There was no need for a sauce, even though a tub was included. The sweet potatoes were steamed in natural juices, not sugary stuff, and made a perfect side dish.  We BBQ rib fans have travelled across the Vegas valley for some good ribs and on this day, we all agreed these were the best of the rest!"}
{"text":"We just had a great lunch at the Nevada Chicken Cafe. Really fresh salad, the pulled pork sandwich was excellent and the BBQ chicken was as good as I've ever had. There are plenty of staff who keep the place clean.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and it smelled good from the outside. The cashier was nice and answered our questions  since it was our first time there. Our food came out quickly. There was a small sauce bar. I got  the hot sauce: which was basic Louisiana hot sauce, nothing special. BBQ: I was really looking fwd to good BBQ sauce but this was basic stuff that can be found in A bottle.  The cucumber salsa: the tastiest thing there. Ranch:came from a bottle. 1/4 white The chicken:DRY DRY DRY  Mashed potatoes; comparable to KFC. GROSS. Marconi and cheese: I read the other reviews and was expecting some good Mac and cheese. That was not what happened. SOO BLAND. EXTREMELY BLAND.  I'm extremely disappointed but good customer service."}
{"text":"The menu has all the best items you could imagine. Smooth service every time and they can handle huge orders for events. Awesome spot!"}
{"text":"I had a problem but it was resolved to my satisfaction when the owner personally called me to get to the bottom of it. I now think it's a manager problem and/or employee problem and my problem was an isolated case and will try this establishment again to see if I get different results. We have always been satisfied with the Sahara location over the years and I trust that this new location will be on par with Sahara in the near future. New locations always have a few problems to be worked out and I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. I've been assured that they always serve the freshest of foods and the owner's word is good enough for me as he seems like a man of integrity by what I could tell over the phone."}
{"text":"We almost went to Popeyes until my mom spotted this place. It's a small place, so I'm glad there wasn't a rush of any sort. The staff wasn't very friendly, I think I heard a greeting from one or two of them and that was to a different customer. ?  Now what makes the four star rating is the food. I had the chicken and ribs combo with the sweet potato side. It was awesome. Perfectly seasoned to the point where you don't need to ad any sauce. Meat was very tender. Overall pretty good. I'll definitely visit again next time I'm in town. Hopefully the customer service will be a little better."}
{"text":"The absolute best BBQ I've had since I've moved to Las Vegas, I'm from Detroit and my Hubby is a Marine from Atlanta and we loved everything we ordered! The ribs were slappin even without sauce! So glad we found this place!!!!!! 10 stars"}
{"text":"Just went into Nevada chicken and got excellent service like always! I've been coming here ever since I've moved to Vegas and will continue to come the food is always on point just like the service. Thanks Nevada Chicken!"}
{"text":"The best damn chicken in town.  Forget the Colonel, Popeye, Church's and all the rest.  Chicken cooked on the grill in front of you so it's fresh.  The salads are fresh and good portions.  The sides are hot and good, mac and cheese, beans, potato salad are my favorites. Your food is delivered to you hot and delicious and quick.  It is truly finger licking good."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times in the last few weeks. I've had a pulled pork sandwich which was amazing, I also had the rib and wing combo...my husband and I both agree it is the best BBQ we had in this town and we've both lived here for 15 years. The service is always great, the people are friendly and the wait has never been too long. My daughter also really liked the macaroni & cheese, she said it had a bit of spice but it was really good.   I also signed up for their email club and get some fantastic deals. I would absolutely recommend Nevada Chicken Cafe to all my friends."}
{"text":"This place was something I have never heard of or seen before, right in the Walmart shopping center on rainbow and 215. My sister and I decided to try it out.   A nice sit down eatery in between fast food and restaurant status. Area is really clean and cashier helped us out.   The ribs was delicious very tender and there was a bar of sauces to choose from, barbecue, salsa, and horseradish ranch very yummy. I ordered the CHICKEN AVOCADO wrap and it was awesome! I bet the chicken they make are always fresh, slowly grilled rotisserie style. The ingredients tasted fresh as well. ROTISSERIE CHICKEN at its finest.  Definitely coming back ."}
{"text":"Surprisingly delicious, not so great neighborhood though......fresh food, large portions, will return"}
{"text":"I love this place ! Love Love Love !! The food is so yummy, esp the chicken chili ! Heavenly !! The rice and bean wrap is amazing too ! I just cannot get enough of this scrumptious food ! Highly recommended !!! YUM"}
{"text":"If you come in early you might get lucky and get 8 hole wings instead of  8 wingets..."}
{"text":"Holy Hell! This food is AWESOME!! The chicken is so tender and flavorful!! The ribs taste awesome and have a great consistency. They are even better with a little BBQ sauce. Their salad and vegitables are SO fresh and taste amazing. The corn falls off the cob into your mouth just as your teeth come to rest on the kernals. I got the 1/4 rack of ribs and chicken combo. It comes with a small little taster of their garden salad w/italian dressing on the plate (almost like a garnish, but it's delicious!!) and a tortilla..the combo comes with a drink and one side. It was about $15 bucks but I paid about $10 after a $5 off deal from Yelp for checking in. The price seemed a little high for a semi-fast food-ish place like this but after eating the food, it is ABSOLUTELY worth it. I'd rather pay that much for THIS food than spend the same amount or maybe even more at a fancy place like Lucille's or even a step down from that at Famous Daves. Try this place!!! It's awesome. Quick, easy and a good balance between heathly food and comfort food. They even have smoothies, fruit salad and desert! I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This place is located right next to chipotle and honestly i don't know why everyone goes to chipotle they should be going here !! They literally sell chicken , ribs and salad and healthy juices like it's literally half unhealthy and half healthy it just depends on the person lol like I walked in here and the smell of chicken and ribs omg got me sooooo hungry but I'm trying to keep a healthy regimen so I got the veggie soup and the avocado salad with the kale and Berry smoothie . The girl working the front seemed like a newbie she didn't even know they had veggie soup on their menu O.o anyways , they give LARGE portions of their food and soup and my salad even came with a side of sautéed veggies but you can choose different sides if you wanted . And the smoothie tasted pretty healthy I don't think they even put milk or yogurt in it which is a good thing . But yeah this place is pretty delicious and their portions are very generous , I definitely would recommend , next time you wanna get chipotle .. Go here instead hahaha"}
{"text":"I have been here many times and always very happy with the food.  I was pleasantly surprised that the yelp check in was giving a 30 percent off entire purchase discount so that was great.  I ordered 2 full racks w/ a side of mashed potatoes and gravy w/ each rack.  I also ordered a chicken breast for my dog.  When I placed the order I told them one full rack of ribs and mashed potatoes was being dropped of to a friend for lunch so I needed it bagged separate with utensils.  When the order came out I checked to make sure and it was not bagged correctly.  They fixed it for me and I was on my way to deliver it.  Ribs get 5/5 for the great flavor and taste.  I am assuming the chicken rates a 5/5 as well.  I divided it into small portions for my dog and she always wants more.  Recommend to anyone and we will return again soon.  Service is friendly and it smells great when the grill is on."}
{"text":"This will be short and sweet. . .  When you have the word \"CHICKEN\" in the name of your restaurant. . .your chicken had better be the BEST if not one of the best that I have ever had in my life. . .   Well sad enough. . .the chicken was NOT that great.  it lacked flavor. . .and I got the dark meat and it was not that juicy either.  This chicken was an EPIC fail!  The baby back ribs were better and they were on a scale of 1 to 10 a lowly 2. . .=(  Tough. . .no flavor unless you drenched it in their BBQ sauce.    Will I go back. . .heck NO!  Totally not worth the price. . .OR my time.    And if you were thinking that maybe the personalities of the staff would encourage you to return. . .you can forget about it.  They were the most dispirited bunch I had ever seen.  The only time they got lively was when they were talking to each other in the open kitchen. . .and they were laughing and talking so loud that they drowned out the background music. . . :/"}
{"text":"The Ribs are the best on the Menu and cant go wrong with their sides! Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Great food and great staff. Love eating at this this joint it's the bee's knees. Better then the big corporations like kfc"}
{"text":"I bookmarked this place months ago, drive by frequently- rolling down my windows and sucking in big lungfuls of their tasty barbecue chicken smell as I pass. I finally caved and got the $20 for $10 Yelp deal and redeemed it today for lunch with the BF.  After extensively checking reviews here and browsing their online menu, I settled on the 1/4 rack rib combo with leg+thigh for my guy, with a side of saffron rice, and a chicken mozzarella wrap for myself with the mac and cheese. Opted for a taste of home with a Dr. Pepper for our drink, and hit up the salsa bar for a cucumber-based pico de gallo, an orange-looking \"salsa verde\", and a crave-inducing garlic ranch sauce.  Service was quick and friendly, and despite a lackluster exterior, the interior of the place is clean and organized with windowed views to the kitchen where you can watch the guys cutting up the hot grilled meats as you wait for your food. Plenty of booths, and I was downright surprised to see tables of families with eerily silent kids- kids entirely focused on devouring their food. That's downright unusual, and I knew I was in for something special.  The ribs we ordered saucy, at the cashier's suggestion, despite his mention that the dry-rub style sell better. I love a good sauce, and theirs was spot on! Not to spicy, not too sweet, but good balance and robust flavor that complemented the char of the chicken as well as the meaty ribs. BF and I picked off of one another's plates but the obvious was that I should have gone for a second meat plate rather than a wrap.  The mozzarella wrap was large and tasty, and served as an excellent vehicle for that amazing garlic ranch sauce they have, but the taste of the cold chicken was more subdued and the grill-fresh char flavor was rendered almost absent. It's a good healthy-ish option though, but I might opt for a salad instead next time.  As for the sides? The saffron rice was moist and flavorful, and the mac was solid- not dry, not overly cheesy and saucy, but a good version worth having on the menu that doesn't feel too heavy or contrast too sharply with the other major menu offerings.   Attentive and helpful service, damn good chicken and ribs, AND a Yelp deal to offset the price? Done.   Final notes: Use your Yelp app to check in, and get 30% off (not not in combination with the Yelp deal) or sign up for their mailing list online and get coupons and specials to your inbox on a regular basis."}
{"text":"My family really loves Nevada Chicken Cafe. Every time we go there we look forward to the polite staff and really good food.  We were so impressed with the service and BBQ that we bragged to our neighbors about them.   Keep up the good work N.C.C.   Thank you."}
{"text":"met up with friends & went here for dinner before seeing movie - always good !! !! keep it up  ..... Love that they keep menu simple as well"}
{"text":"This place has a soft spot in my heart. I love seeing the grill in front. The food is honest, real, and made in the restaurant not frozen and reheated. Its healthy. Its not a chain."}
{"text":"This is by far the Best Restaurant in Nevada!  If I could pick one place to go, this would be it. I Love the BBQ, Fresh Fruit & Salad!"}
{"text":"Ate there and OMG the RIBS!!  I didn't use the sauce because they were so perfect. Nice juicy and full of flavor. The mac and cheese was really good as well.  Just the right amount of cheesy.  If you are ever in the area you MUST stop."}
{"text":"I found this location by accident yesterday, and walking in and getting food to go was a great move. Because of my current physical condition I could not stay and eat. But that is not a bad thing because if I would have stayed and ate, I would have blown up like a balloon with all the good food they have there. The Half chicken and potato salad were awesome. I will visit again for sure."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite to eat with the family after getting haircuts at SportClips. Lots of cool chicken options, and the place and food looked and tasted fresher than an El Pollo Loco. The special of the day was a 1/4 chicken and 4-rib combo that came with a side and a drink for $11.99. We got two with a chicken soup for less than $25 after our Yelp discount! The ribs were very tasty, the chicken tasted very moist (but not flavored much), and the ribs were the best part. Only bad thing was they ran out of ice while we were there, and it took about 20 min to get our order and ice. Otherwise a pretty good experience."}
{"text":"The delicious fresh grilled chicken you know and crave from the Sahara location now has another new location! Staff is friendly and they do online ordering and delivery.   Menu of chicken and ribs, salads,  wraps,  wings, and hot and cold sides is the same as usual.  The only difference really is the bigger and cleaner space.  My favorite is the three piece chicken with two sides,  but I never can make up my mind about which sides because they're all good. Unfortunately, my first visit here, they forgot one of the two sides I ordered."}
{"text":"This is a great lunch spot- order in, take out, or delivery. They also sell whole chickens, which i think you can get for a discount towards the end of the day.   When you order inside the restaurant, you can see the side options and they all look yummy, it's almost hard to choose!  There are two chicken options for the chicken: I prefer the rotisserie chicken over the mesquite, but they are both very good- you should specify which you prefer when ordering. Consider ordering a family meal w/ sides over individual orders to save $$. All of the sides were tasty, including the chicken pasta (cold), mac n cheese, mashed potatoes and gravy, salad, etc.   They also serve wraps, salads, and sandwiches, again very delicious. My favorite is the chicken avocado wrap. Mmmm...   Added bonus for NCC is that they let you create your own wrap or salad from scratch and you can order all white meat. Let them know what ingredients you want from the list and they'll whip it up for you.   NCC has an online ordering option on their website, but you have to pay with a credit card (not a fan of this forced payment option). But if you order by phone you can pay cash or card at the counter."}
{"text":"Had a taste for BBQ ribs - new to the area and found Nevada Chicken. The ribs were really great! I will try the chicken next time"}
{"text":"Great chicken place to by if you want something different. Food was ready not too long after I ordered it. Drove home 15 minutes later and chicken was still delicious!"}
{"text":"Just driving by and I could smell the BBQ from this location. BBQ Chicken & BBQ ribs are excellent. Comfortable seating inside and out. A hit with the locals."}
{"text":"Thanks to the boys at McCaney Price Motors for the heads up on The Nevada Chicken Cafe, they are definitely another hidden gem here in Vegas and lawd they are good. The ribs down to the wings oh and please dont forget the sides. lol its just no losing eating here.         On Veterans day my little brother and I decided to spend lunch here and with as many delicious options there is to choose from, just beware these boys fill you up."}
{"text":"I placed an ordered through UberEATS, I ordered a create your own chicken wrap and received it with no chicken. When I called the restaurant in hopes of getting the matter resolved I was told that I didn't pick chicken off of what I could  add to the wrap, HOWEVER there is no option to add chicken unless you put it in the comments below. Who would think that was necessary at a Chicken cafe on a create your own CHICKEN wrap!!! I did not get the option for them to fix it the lady basically told me it was my fault! I paid more for a create your own \"veggie wrap\" than I would have paid for a chicken wrap. Never eating here AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Visited the sahara location and it was alright. I got the whole chicken. Pricing is decent and I like that the chicken doesn't go dry after a day. I was on a low carb day, so I wanted something with extra protein gainzzz. Service was good. Nice staff and they were pretty fast."}
{"text":"This is by far my all time favorite place to visit when wanting BBQ chicken. The chicken is always cooked to perfection but the smokey flavor sets it off the top. This includes their BBQ sauce that is to die for! Don't be fooled though, their sides are also one of my favorites. In fact, their mashed potatoes are by far the best I've ever tasted! Their Mac and cheese is always fresh and super creamy. Their veggies and fruits are always super fresh.  I've been coming to this place for years now and it's always been the same faces. The employees are ALL working and because they're all so quick, efficient, and friendly, it's hard to tell who their manager is because you can see that much passion in the work that hey do. Let's not forget their owners. They are always present and always going above and beyond to make sure that not only their customers get the best service, but that their employees also also happy and have their support.   My top 10 places for food service of all time!"}
{"text":"If you want to try this place I suggest doing it soon because chances are it wont last long. Six bucks for a small dried out chicken breast and wing served with a tortilla. The menu board is in a weird place,To read it you need to strain your neck backwards to read it. I waited 12 minutes for the chicken,it was a to go order,The bag was given to me without a fork,knife or napkin. I spent the 12 minutes just watching a table that was dirty. It was never bussed,instead the five workers just stood around and chatted. I wont be returning. May I suggest the Chipotle right next door..better food better value"}
{"text":"Everytime I  visit NCC im always hapoy i came, the food is always fresh.  whenever my family and friends come into town and we always stop here I love the best fresh salad and fruit selection Service is fast and the restaurant is always clean."}
{"text":"Went to the newest location of Nevada Chicken Cafe I like the decor inside.  Eric is the gentleman that helped me up front he was very nice I'm so glad there is one closer to me now! I love Nevada Chicken Cafe smells so good when you walk in everything is nice and fresh as always!"}
{"text":"I have to be honest this locations chicken is delicious. The perfect combination of comfort food and soul food. This is the place I select for our office corporate meetings. Tonight I stopped by to buy dinner for my family. I can't say they have evee disappointed me yet. Theyre awesome here. Johnathan helped me out tonight with my order. Great location and staff."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! I've been coming to this place after I learned it was by my neighborhood. I used to go all the way to Sahara just to get my favorite food!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Quick friendly service, excellent food! The ribs are my favorite! All the food is hot and fresh with a great selection. I would highly reccomend Nevada Chicken Cafe if you want good quality food with great staff."}
{"text":"I love eating at the Nevada Chicken Cafe on Fort Apache. This is the location I frequent most often since the time of their opening in November of 2017.  Nevada Chicken Cafe has great service, excellent food, and fair pricing for a filling and somewhat healthy meal.  I eat there at least twice a week for either lunch or dinner. I've introduced a couple of friends to this restaurant as well, and they enjoy it as much as I do. This location is inside of the Tropicana Beltway Shopping Center, between Panera Bread and Panda Express.  You can't miss it.  They also have two other locations in southwest Vegas, which I haven't been to yet.... I'm sort of loyal to this branch."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been there several times since I found it a month ago. The mac and cheese is amazing and the ribs and chicken have great flavor. I'd give it 5 stars but twice I've been there at 9(they close at 10) and they are out of chicken or something else."}
{"text":"It pains me to write this review because I love the food here, but the service sucks. The last couple times we have been in they were out of wings. One of those times it was later in the evening, maybe around 6 or so. I could understand them being out since it was so late in the day. But my most recent visit was at 1:30 and they were out. I don't know if they only make x per day or what, but this is becoming a trend I don't like!   Besides not having my favorite item available, the customer service is pretty bad. On our last visit, there was a decent rush, about 10 people in line, and only one cashier. Not only that, but she would stop in the middle of taking orders, and answer the phone and take their order. Totally unprofessional and rude! They do this every time they are busy too. One weird thing to mention is there are no trash cans so people can't throw away their garbage, so dishes and trash are left on the tables for a ridiculously long time. Also, they need to pay more attention to detail. We ordered a bunch of food and told them we were dining in, yet our food was packaged to go. Also when we specified tortillas with our food, we got dinner rolls. These are all minor things, but they add up to one big annoyance!  In summary, get your shit together NCC! I am not going to boycott this place because I love the food, but I will probably only order to-go from now on."}
{"text":"The ribs and chicken here never cease to amaze me, I could eat here every single day of my life if I could. The flavor of their ribs is so delicious, and the chicken is always so juicy. I always get the mashed potatoes and gravy as my side because I'm hooked on them. This place has great food!!!"}
{"text":"First time here.  Had the combo (1/4 chicken 1/4 ribs).  Ribs were tender and the the chicken (dark meat) had a lot of flavor"}
{"text":"Best chicken and ribs I've ever put in my mouth!! Homemade sauces, healthy sides along with the favorites round off the meal! The chicken stands on it own tho... Get your superfood smoothie too!  Don't forget to tip the guy when you order delivery too!"}
{"text":"This place is basically a fast food place posing as a casual upscale restaurant. The  prices are comparable to Church's, Pollo Loco etc. And the other reviews are accurate - Chicken is okay, white chicken is a little dry but that is what you can expect from white chicken. The ribs are what really slide this restaurant down the drain. The ribs are not good, fatty with no meat, and overcooked. They had an identity crisis and should have just focused on chicken. I was pretty disappointed overall. If you view this place more of a fast food joint, as opposed to a casual upscale, it will help with expectations and your experience will be more enjoyable. You can't trust ribs from a fast food joint."}
{"text":"Mashed potatoes and gravy were to die for! We fought over them. Everything was great too...but I could roll around in the potatoes if I had a choice to. Yum!"}
{"text":"Walking up to the restaurant, the aroma of mesquite is enough to make your taste buds salivate. I have visited a handful of times now and each time has been excellent! Both the ribs and chicken are superb, and the side of bbq sauce they give you to dip or spoon on your meat is definitely one of the best bbq sauces I have ever tasted which makes it the perfect compliment. The other house made blueberry bbq sauce is also excellent. They offer numerous side orders and thus far the potato salad is my personal favorite. Baked beans were good, macaroni and cheese is ok. My daughter enjoyed the fresh fruit salad. Service has been friendly, and the quality of the food with the very short wait time is outstanding! I have ordered to go every time but the restaurant is very clean. Will be visiting more often as my young adult children enjoy it as much as I do."}
{"text":"Chicken was a little dry but good nonetheless, the saffron rice was good, but the ribs were awful- dry, sauceless, funky blend of seasoning that just didn't jive for me.  I'd eat here again, but both the chicken and the ribs at CJ's Texas BBQ up the street are better and probably cheaper, so I'd rather go there."}
{"text":"Excellent food, friendly service, ribs are fantastic! The ceasars salad is just how I like it we love this place!!!"}
{"text":"It's ok. That's how I would describe this place. I stood in front of the register for a good 5 mins before the guy behind the register acknowledge my presence. I understand that he was counting out his drawer, but good customer service dictates that you at least greet your customers and thank them for their patience.  This is the second time we have eaten here. The chicken tastes good, but is too dry. The sides are pretty good. Overall this place has a ton of potential however they need to work on their staff's morale as well as downsizing their menu to a few quality selections versus a big menu of average selections."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time today. The ribs were really tasty even without the BBQ sauce. The chicken and mashed potatoes and gravy were also really delicious. Cashiers were very friendly. Great atmosphere also."}
{"text":"Worst customer service I've ever experienced the girl at the front was so rude she snapped at me about my order even though I tried to point to her what I wanted she didn't want to hear it plus she snapped at my wife and didn't even apologize then my wife told her she was being rude still she tries to make a big deal about the order. I finally decide  to let it go then my wife's card wasn't reading instead of helping she snapped at my wife at that point I said I'm down thanks but no thanks keep the food and we left. If this is how you operate after a grand opening good luck. Never have I felt so disrespected not only will I never return but I would advise you all to go next door to Panera. Thanks but no thanks"}
{"text":"We usually eat here once a week.  We've enjoyed the food that much. However, I'm hoping last Friday night was a fluke and not a sign of things to come.  The corn on the cob was terribly over-cooked and inedible and the wings were half the size that they've been in the past.  We're really hoping it was just an off-night."}
{"text":"We tried this place on a whim when I changed my mind last minute walking into Chpotle, and was pleasantly surprised! The chicken is quite delicious! Their servings are large so my husband and I can share a 4pc dark platter. My favorite side is the Mac n cheese.. it's SO good."}
{"text":"For a chicken café, they really don't do chicken that well.  We have orders this several times at work and whenever I got the chicken it was rather bland.  Their vegetables are OK, but it's not called Nevada Vegetable Café.  What NOT to get: The sweet potatoes.  These just didn't taste right.  I have yet to be impressed by this place and they have had it at the office 3 or 4 times now.  Kind of wish they would put another restaurant in rotation.  The only reason I give it two stars is for their spinach feta cheese pasta is really good!  But again, this isn't called Nevada Spinach Feta Cheese Pasta Café.  -:P  Seriously - find chicken elsewhere."}
{"text":"Must say, I was pleasantly surprised with the chicken here.  Got the 3 piece of mesquite and found it to be very flavorful.  Seasoning on the outside was extremely tasty.  Maybe not the juiciest chicken I've ever had but by no means dry.    Found the regular prices to be a bit on the expensive side for what you get but that in no way effects my stars.  I had a coupon so it made the prices far more reasonable.    Didn't try the sides so no idea of they are good or bad.  But the restaurant is bright, clean and overall nicely done up in my opinion.   The staff was friendly and everything was problem free.    Would I eat here again???   If I had another coupon, definitely.   If not, highly unlikely.   But if money ain't a thang for you and you just want some very good chicken, you probably won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"If I could rate a zero I would. The ribs are tuff and taste like vinegar. The pulled pork sandwich was dry, the chicken sandwich could of been made wit a pigeon I don't know but it was horrible. Would not recommend. Oh and the Mac and cheese taste like the stuff out the box."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed. I ordered a half rack, and mac as my side. The ribs looked good, and it was a healthy portion, but they just didn't have anything special going on. Served dry, and I don't think they spent much time in the slow cooker. The BBQ sauce was pretty standard fare, and served in an awkward glass bottle that made for difficult pouring.  The mac and cheese was bland, very disappointing. And a side tortilla was an odd addition for a rib plate.   It was very clean, the staff was friendly. I wanted to like the place, but the flavor just wasn't there. I kind of felt like I was at El Pollo Loco.   For the plate and a Bud Light, I spent $20. For a few bucks more I could have gone up the road to the sit-down bbq chain and had a much better meal, with bold sides and corn bread. With the handful of other BBQ places in town running stiff competition with some real authentic down-home skills, these guys are going to have to step it way up in the flavor department if they want to keep up."}
{"text":"The Clean and well kept dining area first got my attention. There were people sitting at the tables enjoying their meals, another plus. The aroma of smoked meat, ok now my eyes are looking for the menu and  my tummy is yelling -hurry up and order already!  I ordered the smoked chicken with 2 sides, bbq baked beans and red potato salad. Everything was good, my chicken breast was tender, bbq sauce on point, bbq baked beans- , potato salad- very tasty evenly though I didn't make it myself   Oh and a dinner roll its also included with the meal.  The food rocks man! I can't wait until the next time."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the ribs and chicken, always love coming here. Very clean, good service."}
{"text":"We went in a few weeks ago and enjoyed the chicken. My kids loved the Mac & Cheese. The portions were huge and worth the price. Would recommend giving it a try! Going to try the Waldorf chicken sald next time"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for lunch this past week. The place is spotlessly clean. The people we're friendly and helpful and the food was great! Very pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"The Manager I encountered was a total asshole, after they got my order wrong. He had such an attitude and wasn't apologetic at all! Won't come back!"}
{"text":"Let me start this out with the fact that I almost NEVER write reviews..... but this has compelled me to begin. Since opening I have been going to the Nevada chicken cafe about 2-3 times a month. The food is always fresh and the ingredients are proudly displayed. The staff is friendly, food delicious and service is usually reasonable and within expectations even during busy times. Unfortunately this is where my review of the establishment ends and my candid review of a specific individual begins. This business appears to be family owned. The owner or possibly general manager a gentleman in his late 40's early 50's short hair greying in color is easily spotted. He and he alone is the cause of myself never spending another dollar at the establishment again. This individual has zero professionalism managing employees. On many occasions he can be seen degrading his kitchen staff with extremely rude remarks. He yells, slams things on the counter and pretty much acts like Gordon Ramsey on steroids. Let me tell you something you are not on TV. Intimidation and humiliation are NOT how employees should be treated. If someone (or most staff in this persons eyes) is underperforming one  should stop and look at the quality of leadership first. Have you empowered your staff with the adequate knowledge to excel in there duties? Try some positive reinforcement for a change. The final straw for me was on 4/2/15. I want to have a very late lunch with my boss at around 5:15pm. As usual service was excellent and the food was wonderful. Mr. Owner walks in and immediately starts reprimanding his staff  over what seems to be petty items. Using choice phrases as \"are you stupid\" and \"you must be an idiot\". Upon completion of my meal as I'm walking outside. What to I see (not to my surprise) Mr. Owner sitting on the patio booth, ice cold beer in hand sitting across one of his staff members loudly shouting at him regarding some sort of matter. This was just unprofessional and a disgraceful display of character. For this reason and this reason only I cannot support someone who feels THIS is how to run a business. May I suggest a future more fitting career change, prison guard."}
{"text":"Enjoyed it. Fast, good, and basic place to grab a bite to eat! My BBQ sandwich was good (not spectacular, but I have high BBQ standards- from the south!) My friend said the ribs were a bit over cooked, but I think the chicken here is supposed to be the star. I would return again."}
{"text":"Wow. So I got the yelp deal for this and I was pleasantly surprised. I got the group on for me and my boyfriend and he's a really picky eater, so I was really crossing my fingers that he would like this place.   I ordered the chicken Ceaser wrap with the broccoli salad  and he got the 1/4 ribs , breast and wings and a side of mashed potatoes. Wow just wow! We will most definitely be coming back! Along with that everyone was super nice and courteous. My bf got the Mac and cheese and didn't like it and sent it back and they had to problem giving us something else.   Thanks Nevada chicken cafe !!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here we got a certificate through restaurants.com so we wanted to try it out. The chicken was good, kind of dry but still good the ribs were also very tender. We ended up getting the family deal which was $46.99, I felt that it was a lot of money for the amount of food we got, the total spent was about $75, we got 2 more sides and a pulled pork sandwich. This was to feed 8 people.  We did have to go back in the restaurant because they forgot to pack our coleslaw in the to go bag so always check your bags specially if you're taking it to go."}
{"text":"Stopped by during their Aug 1st official grand opening but sadly didn't arrive in time to grab one of the $25 gift cards they were giving away to the first 50 customers. I was excited to try their chicken because I had heard a lot about the other location and there was also a 30% off grand opening special. Rachel and I opted for the 3 piece dark, a full rack of ribs, and sides of mac & cheese. The ordering process kind of drags along because while the line goes right in front of the line where food is prepped and sides are displayed/scooped, you have to wait until you get to the registers to place your order. Why not have it like Chipotle/Cafe Rio where you can order your food and watch it made as it moves along? I mean it's all right there in front of you...but I digress...  Anyways, back on track. Once you order and pay, you're given a number to place on your table and they'll deliver the food right to you similar to Smashburger and Jason's Deli. The chicken was juicy and the skin was flavorful and well seasoned. The mac & cheese was bleh and had no taste to it whatsoever! Was there even real cheese in there? Even a box of Kraft mac & cheese has more flavor WTF! The ribs were decent and had some good flavor and seasoning on it but you can tell they were just grilled and not smoked because they were hard to get off the bone and some parts were a little overcooked. Decent nonetheless, but at $21.99 per rack, wouldn't be worth it without some sort of discount.  The staff were all very nice although some of the cashiers seemed confused during the ordering process and their attention was not always focused on the transaction. The whole store seemed very hectic but that's typically the nature of a new business and hopefully with some experience, everything will run much more smoothly in the future!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location since I had only been to the new one in the SW. When I had gone to the new location I thought the chicken was decent, however, now coming to the Sahara location I'm not sure if I would return Nevada Chicken Cafe.  The wait time alone is a turn off! After placing my take out order I waited another 25 or so min before getting my order. Why did it take so long? There were no other orders for them to kick out because there was barely anyone there when I arrived and everyone seated at booths were already eating.  When I finally got my food and took it home, I realized that they hadn't given me any utensils...luckily I wasn't trying to eat in the car or something otherwise I would've been screwed. I had ordered a half chicken w/ mashed potatoes and a chicken cobb salad w/ blue cheese. The half chicken were tiny pieces and there were only 3 of them instead of 4. Is the wing not considered part of one half of a chicken? Because I didn't get one. The mashed potatoes were garbage and had no taste to it even though it was smothered in gravy. The cobb salad ironically looked much larger than the half chicken, but I had gotten it for the gf. Maybe I should've gotten 2 salads since both meals were about the same price at $9-10 each.  If the half chicken meals are this small I could eat 2 chickens then. Crazy! If they were going to half ass my meal then they should've gotten the order out sooner! Any other chicken restaurant out there would probably be better than this place!"}
{"text":"My wife drives by this place all the time. The smell and smoke brought us in and we were so disappointed.  First, the food was brought out cold and the chicken was not fully cooked. Absolutely the worst bbq i ever had. The mashed potatoes tasted like instant. The ribs were dry and rough. I complained and they wanted to give me more sides. No refund of anything. I said no to their nasty sides. DO NOT EAT HERE!!!! 50 bucks down the drain."}
{"text":"This location is not as good as the other ones. I keep getting burnt, dried out food. The first couple of times you give them the benefit of the doubt. But 3 strikes? No good. How do you serve that to someone who paid you money for it?"}
{"text":"Recently discovered and surprised how good the chicken and ribs and coleslaw are. The one on Durango is new and the personnel very nice. Definitely place to return. Priced very reasonably...enjoy"}
{"text":"I must say i love this place, it's nothing fancy but they have excellent food. I went today to get a pulled pork sandwich and chicken pasta salad and it was delicious. I've been here several times now and i have never been disappointed and always left with a full tummy. I love their ribs very meaty and juicy. Don't pass this place up if you see it. I give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"First time here and the food is super yummy. There's a bbq going outside on the patio and everything was fresh and flavorful. Booths inside and tables outside; good place to gather with friends for a casual meal. Prices are reasonable as well. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I couldn't get past the ordering process before walking out because of horrible customer service... No thanks. I rather spend my money at Chipotle next door."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. I am a regular here for 2 years now and have never been let down. I have taken freinds here from out of state and they have all loved the food."}
{"text":"Food always fresh good can't go wrong with this place the wraps are bomb gotta try one"}
{"text":"I love their salads and they are always quick around lunch time which is helpful for our busy office. I hope the one that's supposed to open near our office opens soon!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever the food is good if you can get what you ordered I got the house salad 10.00 that should come with chicken and dressing  First no dressing  Had to wait for someone to talk to me first took 5-minutes when they have at least 10- people working finally get my dressing and see I have no chicken on my salad  Did not go back up for chicken  Nobody comes around and ask how's everything  Can't give you a real review on food because I never got what I ordered  Not sure if I would suggest this place it's been open for a while no excuse for the bad service"}
{"text":"We got to sit and watch football while listening to music and eating great food. We both got the combo for $10.99. It included 3 ribs, a leg, thigh, side, and drink! So good!"}
{"text":"The service at this location is amazing.  Very helpful staff greeted me the moment I entered and made ordering a snap.  If you go, try the baby back ribs and baked beans.yummy yummy yummy."}
{"text":"The chicken is really good and the ribs too. Customer service is second to none and my fav part, the smell.. It smells lovely"}
{"text":"The service is great and their chicken and ribs are absolutely amazing . The desserts .very clean facility.im glad I have this location by my house in the south west."}
{"text":"I've eaten here quite a bit over the years, but never written a review. I go through cravings, and when it's for chicken I really like their grilled chicken (they also got rotisserie style). I really like it's flavoring, I believe it's mediterainian type seasoning.  Also, recently, I started trying their grilled pork ribs, and I really like them and have been on a steady crave for those the last few times I've been there. They serve them dry with the sauce on the side. And I like this. If your dry rub is good, then you shouldn't have to smother your ribs in bbq sauce.  I've seen a bunch of bad reviews here on Yelp, and I will say they have their bad days (or orders). In my experience, every 6th order is fudged a bit. They need to clean this up and become more consistent. But the place is always crowded...I guess by people who don't post on Yelp!  But I want more places like this. Where else can you get freshly grilled or rotisserie chickens other than the supermarket? And the quality and taste is much better than the market - although almost double the price ($5 market, $9 at NCC).  I wish there was a place like this in Henderson, near my work, as it would be perfect for my lunch needs (fresh meat, no carbs - unless you splurge on sides)."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service. I had the chicken bbq sandwich, which was delicious. The service was friendly, they even asked if I wanted coleslaw on my sandwich or on the side, which was considerate. My husband chose mashed potatoes with gravy and said they were the best he ever had. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed!! Saw this place around and decided to try it out. Got the BBQ wings and they were ok. Then decided to try the ribs. They were gross!!! The ribs had absolutely no seasoning and were dry. Also we ordered drinks and the whole soda machine had no carbonation so the drinks were flat we asked if they could fix the CO2 and a few other customers complained as well we stayed for about 30 minutes and they did not fix the machine. It was slow in the store so it's not like they were busy. Definitely wasted my money here will not recommend and will not be returning."}
{"text":"The food was ok. The staff sat in the largest table available eating lunch while my family and I had to push together a booth and table to have enough seating for our family while the staff took up the largest table for 2 workers. It was way to hot inside and outside was not an option since the booths aren't large enough for my family and me. We ate and as soon as I got home I felt nauseous I thought it was just me but No! My husband sorry to be so explicit for diarrhea my sister in law nausea and diarrhea. If one of us would have been sick I could blame a bug. However it was all of us and the only in common food we had that day was nevada chicken cafe. So food ok place too hot and food poisoning for sure was my experience from this place."}
{"text":"Food was okay.  I didn't really like my wrap only because I changed my mind And wanted something hot.  Everyone appears to go there for Ribs.  I ordered a 1/4 rack.  They were pretty good.  Not the fall off the bone good. However they were still tasty."}
{"text":"Nevada Chicken Cafe is a good place to eat, however I dont think I'll be returning anytime soon.  Their posted business hours are until 9 PM at night. My friends and I arrived about 15 minutes before close, maybe 20... To order some sandwiches.  I walked in and was told they were closed! I asked early? Can I order anything? The lady just said no were closed! She was polite, but blunt and didn't say anything else. This on a Friday night.  I know the hour was late but if your business advertises that it's open until a specific hour, then it should still serve you or have some options available to customers.  Being turned away is the worst feeling, and should never have happened.  Doubt I will be returning, if I do it'll be to complain to management."}
{"text":"Eh, its good enough, but nothing special at all...lets be honest, anyone can dangle a chicken around some heat and it will taste pretty good, so to say this is a standout cafe would be like saying you McDonalds is fine dining and doesn't give you the runs...im sure you can find better."}
{"text":"This place is always good. A local treasure.  I do the rib & chicken combo with dark meat and it's the best $12 you can spend on food in Vegas."}
{"text":"Always great , and staff is nice and professional. Best rice in the world.come down and enjoy ."}
{"text":"The first time I think the chicken was dry but I just got the half rack of St Louis style ribs and they were super meaty and very good, not spicy at all since all the other BBQ places are making things spicy. My only complaint is they only give you one side!!!! Hey give 2 sides to make it a better meal and charge $2 more. They want $3.25 for an extra side which I think is too much. Will be back for those Ribs!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Perfectly cooked chicken, mind-blowing ribs. Try some of their homemade salsa on the ribs."}
{"text":"This second location is as good as the first! These are the meatiest baby back ribs I've ever seen. I don't know how they do it. These guys nail it every time."}
{"text":"Right off the bat this place was annoying. The line doesn't start where it says it does, there was a 20 minute wait for chicken and a 30 minute wait for ribs. There was no ice and they were out of lemonade (I don't drink soda). The food was good but with the hassle of everything else I can't say it was worth it. The staff was kind of rude and stared a lot, which was very annoying.  Yeah, I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Second time coming to this place. This time I ordered the 4 pc. Chicken (dark) with a side of mashed potatoes / gravy and a salad (House Salad). Food was good I think the chicken could be more flavorful. Salad was great and so we're the mashed potatoes. I think they should have some chicken combos that already come with sides and a drink. We had to order all those items a la carte. They do have plenty of combos for the ribs though. Overall a good menu, the booths could be a little more cleaner and the cashier person should be more enthusiastic and friendlier."}
{"text":"This place is eh! But do not ever order here during lunch time. It is crazy and they take forever to deliver. The food is hit or miss. Sometimes is delicious and other times they over so it with seasonings or just prepping in general. I don't care for their mac and cheese which has a funny taste but their ribs are delicious. If you order the bbq wings make sure you tell them light sauce or else they will add the whole bottle of sauce, which makes it hard when trying to pick up a wing."}
{"text":"Not very great. The ribs and chicken were undercooked the last time I went. I rather you save your money and make better COOKED meats at home."}
{"text":"Been passing by this place wanting to try it out with my boyfriend for awhile. I went in to finally try it and the girls chatting amongst each other not even paying attention to anything else. We were the only ones there for a bit but still. I ordered the chicken and ribs combo which came with one side I ordered to other sides and wings next thing I know the girl was preparing 4 sides and when I confronted she goes you wanted 4 sides no I never asked for that when she was reading back the order it was never mentioned 4 sides only 3! I work in customer service and it wasn't handled the best needless to say. At the end of her continuing to say I ordered 4 sides. Finally after awhile asks if I want a refund I couldn't believe it... at that point I didn't want it I chose to keep the extra side. Then back to chatting it up about \"birthdays and not wanting to get any older.\" I spent $30 there! The food tasted good it was the only thing me and my boyfriend ate all day. Both of us about an hour later started having horrible stomach pains like we literally were in pain and it wouldn't stop. We went the bathroom so many times that day. I did end up taking the food home. I feel stupid for eating the leftovers knowing what happened but I gave it another shot and here I am in the same boat as I was and NO ONE SHOULD FEEL SICK OR HAVE BAD STOMACH PAINS AND GOING THE BATHROOM AFTER EATING ANY FOOD. That is not health code at all the health department needs to check this out ASAP!"}
{"text":"Absolutely a wonderful surprise. We are in town for a conference and were looking for something simple but not a Wendy's or KFC. Pulled in and saw the chicken being cooked outside on the grill and we were sold. We had both the chicken and ribs, salad and garlic potatoes. All were wonderful, lots of flavor, crispy grilled crust on the ribs but still soft on the inside. The chicken was perfect, not over done. The salad was fresh and brightly colored. Also just as important, the restrooms were very clean. We will definitely be back before we leave. You need to go, like right now."}
{"text":"Best ribs ever!  The ribs with the home made sauce is amazing!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Delicious scent of meat permeates the atmosphere as we entered the restaurant. Three rather picky eaters loved this place. Very fresh salad items in clear view and also several healthy sides. Really unexpectedly wonderful. Casual neighborhood fresh food place."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! The staff is very considerate.  But if you're looking for great food, this is the spot.  I've eaten here a few times now and it never disappoints."}
{"text":"Love it love it love it chicken is off the hook. I've eaten here a hundred times and never been disappointed. The consistency is the key because you know the quality is always there and you don't have to think twice. Too many places have different cooks and its hit or miss. The chicken is amazing the pulled pork sandwich is very nice as well. Go in grab a half chicken with honey mustard sauce and let me know what you think."}
{"text":"Love this place, great food, great customer loyalty, great selection.   There's not a lot of rotisserie places in town that are this consistent."}
{"text":"Love this spot for lunch- constantly delicious and healthy meals, friendly and efficient service and for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Omg!!!! Its the Mother of RIBS!!!! I just want to eat 5 Full racks in one sitting!! And the corn on the cob is insane!!!! Wow!! What a lunch!"}
{"text":"We ordered a family meal to go. It was $60 for dinner for 6. Tons of food, 4 side dishes and rolls. We ate and were stuffed. The sides aren't huge so double up if everyone wants a scoop of something."}
{"text":"More of a lunch place than a dinner place. They were out of garlic potatoes when we went and that's what I wanted the most. All that aside, it's a quick service type of place, just order and sit. They give you a number and bring over your food. The food was okay. Probably won't be back unless there's a lunch special."}
{"text":"No matter if I was getting a salad or just ribs, everything is seasoned or prepared right and fresh. My 6 yr old also loves eating here, it's the perfect lunch spot !  I also love their little cucumber salad mix sooo bomb. Service is friendly, fast, and it's always clean."}
{"text":"We really like going here - friendly staff and super yummy  healthy meals. The meals are consistently always good!  and I should add it is always very clean in there. I appreciate that with a smile they always make my special request salad!   It is down the street from the office but it also worth the 25 minute drive from home."}
{"text":"I ordered this for pick up at my job and wasn't the one to get it so I can't say anything of the service, but I can say that nothing about this meal was satisfying. The sides were disgusting and the chicken, which I thought would have to be good, was dry and bland. I actually ended up getting very sick after eating their food."}
{"text":"Our office went here for lunch last week and enjoyed our food. We were surprised at how busy it was, but it's a popular place.   My wife said the chicken ceasar salad was the best she's ever had and others commented on the ribs. I had the chicken sandwich and it tasted good however it was soggy because of the coleslaw and the bun fell apart. Next time I'll get something else."}
{"text":"My office is really close to this spot. Some days I think, maybe I'll call in sick today because work is work, but then suddenly and without notice I develop a craving for chicken. Chicken Cafe chicken specifically, duh. I'm a vegetarian, I mean like depending on the day and how melodramatic I feel like being. So if a sometimes vegetarian loves this chicken enough to not call in sick to work then, my friends, you will love it too. The wraps are the best I've ever had. I feel like this place has a cult following because it's always so packed. Such a strange mix of people from business men in suits to call girls in call girl glitter attire. Chicken Cafe brings everyone together. They're just, ya know, saving the world , one rotisserie chicken at a time. I give them props and I give them my lunch money three days a week. Tell the chef I say yum. Over and out."}
{"text":"Who ever was answering the phones today, had the worse attitude ever, first asked how she can help me then when I started to speak she cut me off and said hold on .... then got back on the phone and when I started to speak she had an attitude ... the reason why you have your job lady is because of paying customers ... most def did not continue my order because the lady lacked customer service skills ....... I get that it's busy no need to make customers know ur pissed about working there ... smh"}
{"text":"Here I am back again mos def couldn't hold off on my rib fix from Nevada Chicken cafe ..... I was just thinking about the first time I tried their tasty ribs and decided to go  I wasn't let down, I like this location more ...."}
{"text":"Grilling outside, great lure.. the smell is incredible.   Stopped in for lunch and was quite surprised. The appearence on the outside makes you think you are going into a hole in the wall. However open the door and its very spacious.   The menu reminded me of a very popular spot down on Charleston. Especially since they serve chicken wraps with sides of spinach feta pasta or chicken pasta, hmmmm... Have seen those somewhere else..   The wrap was good! Tender chicken, loaded with crisp vegetables. The portion size was great, not too big or small. I got the chicken pasta as a side. It had a sweet flavor to it, not too appetizing. My friend got the spinach feta pasta which was a bit salty.   My lunch with a drink was $12, a little pricey for a sandwich and 1 side and no table service.   Not a bad place, but didn't taste anything that I would crave later to make me go back."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time today. The chicken was good, but the sides I got were pretty bland. I got the mac & cheese and mashed potatoes which were nothing special. I dipped my mac & cheese into BBQ sauce so that it would have some flavor.   I also wasn't a huge fan that you can only get drinks in one size, since I had my order to go. Wouldn't come back here again unless I only wanted chicken."}
{"text":"Do it!!! Just just do it! Had a chicken wrap, all the ingredients were super fresh, hearty portion, and the Mac and cheese, YUMMY!!! The meats are really well cooked and seasoned and their sauces hit all the spots!"}
{"text":"I meet my husband for lunch today. I got a house salad as the lady brought us our food there was a bug (fruit fly) not not big deal, I asked her to make me a new salad. I watched her walk around and she just threw out the part where the fruit fly was and didn't make me a new one. She came back to the table I told her that's disgusting and I wanted a new salad. I had to get up to tell the day shift Manager. The manager apologized then made me a new salad. I felt she wasn't mad at her employe. She should of got in trouble. I only ate a few bites and lost my appetite. I will NEVER go back there again!!!"}
{"text":"Okay! I ate a Waldorf Salad last Monday from the shop on Tropicana and Ft. Apache, so I tried the shop on Sahara today and I am sooooo disappointed! I ordered the same salad Waldorf. No apples, 6 grapes, some cranberries and maybe 4  cubes of pineapple. I don't ever remember pineapple being on a Waldorf Salad, but okay no problem. The chicken was unseasoned and bland! Eating at this place today was not a great experience! Sorry to say, but man!!!"}
{"text":"Only four stars because they were out of ribs tpday and the cucumber salad left a lot to be desired. I had the whole white meat only chicken meal with two sides. My chicken wasn't over cooked or dry and it had a great smokey flavor which is complimented by their BBQ sauce. I also had the sweet potatoes which were awesome and not too sweet with their fantastic mac n cheese which had a nice buttery taste. I have finally found my take out chicken place."}
{"text":"Great chk & ribs combo. Chk was a lil dry but still taste good."}
{"text":"Meh, I've had better. The Mac & Cheese was good though. Average."}
{"text":"This location has the best seasoned chicken and ribs. It's clean and the staff is nice. Amir always takes care of me. I can't wait til they add some collard greens to the menu but still, great tasting food."}
{"text":"The service was fast, informative, and super friendly. I would def come back during lunch break!!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  The food is good and the place is very clean and kept up well.   Staff is welcoming and friendly.  They have great ribs and really good chicken.   I love the chicken pasta and Mac and cheese.   You must try this place.  Everyone I have taken to this place loves the food and goes back regularly now."}
{"text":"Love this place! The mesquite chicken is awesome, and i usually get it once a week. Fast, good service, good in_house barbeque sauce. Five stars."}
{"text":"Located in arroyo shopping plaza, next to chipotle.. Been hearing about this restaurant in the radio for a few days now and finally I stop in.. They offer $5 off for check-in. Thank god!!  I order 3 piece leg n thigh but wanted all thighs, so they charge an extra dollar more. The mesquite is very tasty and skin is so crispy.. My side were potatoe salad and chicken pasta salad, which I didn't like so ask them to switch to side salad.  It's just like eating at El Pollo Loco(my fav. Grill chicken place).. Have to admit this place is really clean and you don't have clean up after you finish.. I didn't see any trash can, assuming they do that.. Just like panera bread..  Next time I come here, I'll just order chicken ONLY."}
{"text":"There is absolutely no reason why this restaurant should get anything less than three stars. And to be honest with you they would've gotten four stars in my opinion if there food service was better.   The smell coming from this restaurant is phenomenal. The dining room is extremely clean and the atmosphere is very welcoming. They have a great menu and they have a lot of options for many different types of people.   The food was fresh and organic and tasted amazing! I had a half roasted chicken with baked beans and a side salad. (I eat low carb)! It was delicious! My fitness ordered ribs which smelled amazing,however one of my friends and I received our food right away and the other (who ordered first) didn't get her food for 10 more minutes. The distributing part was people who ordered after her received there meals. But when they did finally bring out her food she was pleased.   I'll go back again and I'll bring people to try it! I just suggest that management steps up on the service quality."}
{"text":"Chicken is tasty! Service and sides suck! Great place for bland food.   Ok so we walk in and that awesome grilled meat smell is in the air. On the outside you see a BBQ grill. Normal gas looking grill, back is surrounded by a brick wall. Lots of outside seating. Inside to the left behind glass you can see someone chopping up raw chicken. Directly in front is what I want to call a tiny salsa bar. It has a cucumber pico salsa, mild salsa, garlic ranch, limes, 3 bottles of BBQ sauce and some bottles of hot sauce. Next to that cart is the soda fountain with Pepsi products. Then it has a line that says enter here. You walk and see on the other side of the glass the sides. You get to the register and order at the end. They give you a number and you sit down.   Our experience: the place was empty except for 2 tables had people there. We go to order and waited 5 minutes for someone to come. Two workers behind the counter were mopping and could care less if we were there. We were about to leave when this guy ceasars from on the tables to help us. Serious? This place needs a class in customer service! We asked about the sides if they were home made. He said yes, and raved how flavorful they were. I got the chicken breast, wing, 1/4 rib combo. Came with a side and a drink. My friend got the dark meat combo and an extra side. Luckily we had a coupon because that was $28. Our coupon brought it down to $21.   The food: no meat on the chicken wing, the chicken breast (attached to the wing still) was small was flavorful tasted like rotisserie chicken. The pork ribs were ok, had a good BBQ roasted flavor.  No BBQ on the meat. I didn't taste a flavor of a spice rub either. So maybe the were salt and peppered. The combos came with a little salad and one flour tortilla. For my side I got mashed potatoes and gravy. There was barely any gravy on the potatoes. But they tasted the best compared to my friend's mac n cheese that had less flavor than Kraft Mac n cheese.  It was really bland and not cheesy. Her other side was potato salad. She said it had way too much onion in it that all she could taste was the onion flavor. The BBQ in the bottles that aren't even marked BBQ are really sweet. You don't get any bold flavor or smokiness.   I might give them a second shot on a salad looks like they have tons of ingredients to choose from."}
{"text":"Kind of hard not to check this place out when you can smell the wonderful aroma of ribs and chicken cooking especially on a empty stomach. So at this point, I said what the hell, it smells good so I went in.  I ordered the 1/4 Ribs n Chicken Combo (St Louis Style Ribs, 1 Wing and Thigh, a choice of 1 side, and a drink), which came out to 12 and some change. The ribs were pretty good. Had a dry rub and good smoke flavor to it. The chicken had good flavor but was a bit dry. I chose sauteed vegetables as my one side which was a mixture of broccoli, green beans, carrots, cauliflower, and green peppers.  There is a \"Salsa\" bar towards the back where you can get garlic ranch sauce, hot sauce, salsa verde, and pico de gallo. Now the pico degallo was a bit weird. They put little pieces of cut up cucumber. Never seen that in a pico de gallo  before.  As far as service goes, when you order for dine in they give you a number to put on your table and then they bring it out to you. That is pretty much all the service that you are gonna get.  Overall, everything was decent except for their dry chicken. Come on man! Anytime you have the word \"Chicken\" in the name of your restaurant, that should be the best item that you serve. Imo the ribs were actually better. I think if they pull the chicken out just a tad bit sooner then it should be good."}
{"text":"Great Food! Chicken is amazing, so are the pork ribs! Sides were different from the norm. I chose the broccoli salad which was delicious. Also got the macaroni and cheese and it was definitely better than a lot of chain restaurant's mac n cheese."}
{"text":"Worst. Restaurant. Ever!!!!  The cashier knew nothing about the menu. I asked what dressing/sauce was on the Chix Pasta. She didn't know and had to ask. I asked which ribs were leaner? She didn't know so had to go ask. I stopped asking questions after that.  Ribs were salty. How can you mess up mac and cheese and mashed potatoes? They managed to do so. The place was messy, the employees looked disorganized so service was BAD. Their concept reminds me of California Chicken Cafe in LA but they come no where close. $30 down the drain on a horrible meal.   It was hot inside, sun beating down so you had to sit in the back area with screaming kids. Definitely save your money...go to Costco and get a whole rotisserie chicken. So much better!"}
{"text":"I love going to Nevada Chicken Cafe because when I order a chicken caesar salad  I know that it will be made with freshly cooked, moist chicken.  Great place for lunch!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite barbecue place in vegas...Love it...Love their barbecue, salads and wraps...you gotta try it"}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical when I read other's reviews, but this place is actually really good. The food was hot. The chicken and ribs were cooked perfectly and the side ( corn on a cob) was pretty fresh. I wished they had a full rib rack combo because I actually preferred the ribs to the chicken, but everything was delicious. The garlic sauce is also a must have.  Don't be intimidated by other comments, check this new location out!"}
{"text":"Tried this today first time had the half chicken take out. Measured more on the quail or Cornish hen size ( see pic) Dry and smoky taste if that's your preference"}
{"text":"Been going here for years and im a big fan. Their chicken is the BEST rotisserie chick in Vegas and their sides AWE MAN!!!! When i was a sales rep i used to cater with NCC all the time got to know the owners Niko and Ladan very cool people! Its a must for las vegas locals...try it you might like it!!"}
{"text":"I didn't like the food they offered. The mashed potatoes taste gross. And price is expensive. I will not returned or recommend this place to my friends and family."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the better bbq chicken places I've been to. Their ribs are just as good as any of the large bbq places. They make all their sides from scratch. I've seen them actually peeling all the sweet potatoes, it's great. I love their bbq wings, they are awesome."}
{"text":"The food was kind of meh; good seasoning on the chicken, flavorless ribs, and I'd please like my \"hot\" side to be at least warm. Also It was a bit over priced for what I got; $35 for lunch for two people. Meh, gave it a try.... And I don't see myself going back"}
{"text":"Have been going to the one on Sahara which is the original chicken cafe. This one is closer to my house. The food rocks!"}
{"text":"Before shopping my husband and I decided to stop here to get a bite to eat since it was lunch time. We had tried a different location before at Sahara. Apparently, this place is cleaner and bigger but the size of the ribs and chicken were much smaller than Sahara although the flavors were the same. Still, customer svc was great and unlimited soda refills. Not sure if im coming back but again they deserve a second chance. Happy Eats!!"}
{"text":"Second location I've been to where they're out of wings. This is ALWAYS! If there's a high demand of chicken wings simply order more in your inventory, it's not rocket science. This is a complete turn off."}
{"text":"First time there had no idea what it was. I walked up to the cash register and spoke with Eric S. He explained to me the entire menu from top to the bottom he was very knowledgeable. After that he went to wipe down a few tables as I looked over my options. I changed my mind a few times but Eric rolled with it. I got the 1/2 chicken and brown rice. The meal comes with a dinner roll and bbq. The rice was good and the chicken was amazing and had the perfect amount of spices. I really liked how the manager was rolling up his sleeves and pitching in helping out his employees. It took a total of 2 min  to get my food out. Will be back there again worth the money will return again!!"}
{"text":"Walked in by accident since we meant to go next door but decided to give it a try.  it was pretty good! I'd definitely go back for a full meal. I only ordered soup and salad"}
{"text":"There are no surprises here.  This is simply roast chicken done well, sides that are fine. I have yet to try the ribs, but I will.  I have been a few times, have found service spotty. Sometimes it is awesome, some times not so awesome. I get it, we all have off days.  I have ordered chicken with sides, and salads with chicken. I think I prefer the salads. But MAYBE when I dive into  a plate of ribs, I might change my mind!  Time will tell."}
{"text":"OH. EM. GEEEEEEEEE. This place is great! The chicken is amazing! Nice atmosphere, everything's open and clean. You can see them making all the food, which I always like. I got the 3 piece chicken with 2 sides, which were the flamed broiled chicken (YUUUUM!) and coleslaw - SO delicious. IMO, they make it like coleslaw should be made.  My husband ordered the 3 piece with the corn and mashed potatoes and gravy. He did say they needed to be a little hotter, but still liked them. The taste of the chicken alone without any sauce is beyond good. Good doesn't even cover it. And can I just say, THEY NEED TO  SELL THEIR ORIGINAL BBQ SAUCE!!!!!!! Holy moly is it incredible (hopefully the management/owner is reading this)! I could eat there several times a week. They're a little more pricey than El Pollo Loco, of course, but I'd go to Nevada Chicken Cafe over El Pollo ANY. DAY. On top of everything, the gentleman at the register was incredibly nice and PATIENT *****WORD ADVICE - if it's you're first time there, PLEASE take a menu at the beginning of the line, step aside and read it. Don't stand at the register asking what all the selections are. There's a lot. Decide what you want before ordering. People behind you will appreciate it*****"}
{"text":"This is our 2nd time here after their grand opening. When we first came during grand opening, there was a guy with a suit and a lady on cashier in a non uniform so I'm guessing they're the owners. The lady was super friendly and when we mentioned the daily special on their website she gave us a discount to match the price with no hassle like it should be.   I came back again today but I did not see the owners. I tried to use the daily special posted on their website and a really nice Latino girl on cashier asked the manager named Michael and the manager said they can't do it. Then we had to show the girl the daily special posted on their website and after she told him, the manager said to give us 10% discount which still ended up being $2 more than the daily special prices. Then the Latino girl actually asked to take my phone to the manager so she can show him the price and the manager said to give us 20% discount which still ended up being higher price than the daily special but we were tired of arguing so we settled for it. The Latino girl apologized and was still super friendly.  During this whole time the manager couldn't walk literally 10 feet to talk to us and we felt bad for the Latino girl who had to go back and forth 3 times and be the middleman.   The food itself is really good and everyone except the manager was super nice and  friendly, but with the managers behaviour, I most likely won't go back. If they are not gonna honor the daily special prices posted on their website, they should have a notice posted somewhere because I'm not coming back here if I have to constantly argue with the manager because he doesn't know his own companies daily special promotion."}
{"text":"Great chicken and other BBQ. Get the yelp special - spend $10 to get $20 worth of food. Simple settings, inside or outside seating. All serve-yourself. The ribs are great!"}
{"text":"A surprise find! Had three hours to spare before I can get our room at a local casino. Needed to find a place to eat with a outdoor patio for our little pet. I was just driving by and seen some people eating outside. So we stopped by, i asked if we can eat outside with our little dog. No Problem they replied!  Now to the food, They had a pretty good size menu with many options. I had the quarter mesquite chicken white meat with black beans. It was really good, it was a perfect portion. Chicken had great flavor and the beans were great. I also had a salad with it, that was also good.  My mom had some Waldorf chicken wrap. She loved it. This was really big, she also had the mac and cheese for her side dish which she also enjoyed. But the wrap she could not stop talking about. Going off my memory, this wrap had chicken, apples, walnuts, blue cheese, and many other things.  Over all we had a very good visit, service was great, food was great."}
{"text":"I never do reviews but I am today! My wife went and got your food last night for dinner and woke up this morning to diarrhea. All happened starting at 3:03 am. Not once but on 4 different occasions back to back. Then shortly after that she puked heavily. She even had to call off work from due to this. It was so bad you could literally smell and see the meat chunks from the vomit . I have the receipt and a picture of the meat that she ate from your establishment. We've eaten there on several occasions and for this to happen it's pretty alarming. Needles to say we won't be eating there ever again!"}
{"text":"With all the hype of great Chicken, I've tried it and it was dry not moist like getting it off the bbq grill. We also got Ribs, and it tasted better than the chicken.  Cannot beat Tony Roma's."}
{"text":"It was ok.   There place is very disorganized and cashiers aren't very friendly.    I had the chicken avocado wrap    It was supposed to be white meat and was mostly dark and avocados were black.   First time in and last time I will go there.   Also prices too high for what they sell."}
{"text":"I don't know where to start... AMAZING FOOD! My favorite meal on the menu is the Ribs and Chic(dark meat) combo, the 3 piece dark(2 legs and a thigh) and their ribs are delish! Everything's all FRESH! Organic chicken, fresh sides. So don't expect it to be a fast food. Good and fresh food takes its time. Chill atmosphere, generous workers, overall, OUTSTANDING!!!!!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my lunch today. Ordered the three piece dark, with a side of black beans and a soda. The bill was little over $10.    The mesquite grilled chicken was very good. The skin was crispy and delicious. The black beans had a nice flavor and the portion was like a cup of soup.   Chicken was served with a small mixed greens salad and tortilla in the side. The green salsa and cucumber salad on the condiment bar both had good flavor.   There's patio seating out the back door and it was a lovely day to enjoy my lunch outdoors.   I was in the long  line at Chipotle when I thought I'd give this location a go. Glad I did. Good stuff!  Ate here again on 3/1/16.  Even better than the last time. The chicken was cooked perfectly. Succulent, smokey and crispy skin. The tortilla was very soft and delicious. Great salsa. The side of black beans had a unique flavor. Unique as in delicious. My wife thought a touch of vinegar was added. Whatever it was they were not your average black beans.  Nice job.  The place was full as it should be. Reasonable prices. Wholesome and delicious food."}
{"text":"This place is way overpriced and the food is not good. The customer service is fair but I do not recommend this place as it is way overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"Based off the pulled pork sandwich and potato salad I give this a 3/5. The pulled pork itself was pretty flavorless. However, it was tender. The potatoe salad was good. I would get it again. I will not go out of my way to come back but if I am hungry and near one I would give it another shot and try the chicken or ribs."}
{"text":"Best place for awesome rotisserie chicken in Las Vegas!! Soooo good...like absolutely everything is amazing :)  if you're thinking about spending money at some naty fast food place....take your care to the corner of Sahara and jones instead! Ncc is the best food place in Vegas! Cheap, great reward system, healthy and always delicious!!"}
{"text":"If I could give a half of a star this place would get one.  Horrible experience!!  Waited 30 minutes for the food only to be told that it would be another 7 minutes which turned into 10 minutes only for someone to come out and say they were running out of baked beans.  The sides looks old and they don't seem to refresh them at the steam table. Everyone that came in after me got their food and left as I continued to wait and wait and wait.  When they finally brought out my order I had miniature ribs with no bbq sauce whatsoever!  Really??? I demanded a refund and the manager seemed to have a bad attitude rather than apologize for the delay.  Seriously??? Bad customer service! They will never get a dime of my money! Once everyone else receives this type of customer service they won't be back either.  Go to Dickeys BBQ instead. Dickeys has good customer service.  Don't know why I tried this place anyway. We should just stick to what we already know to be good. Lesson learned! Will not recommend this place to anyone!!!!"}
{"text":"I am beyond upset with the service I received. Went in there on my lunch break to order three orders of the 8 piece wing meals. After paying the cashier came up to me and told me there was going to be a 20-25 minute wait on my wings. After agreeing because I was looking forward to this for lunch. Note that I made my order at 2:36pm and didn't receive my order till 3:24pm. They then told me they threw in a couple \"extra sides\" for me waiting. Thanks for that but two cups of free beans doesn't do for the almost hour of me waiting for 24 chicken wings, three mac and cheese and beans. I watched as everyone around me came in, ordered and received their orders within 10 minutes of being in there. I will not being going to this location anymore."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the ribs! i get a full rack everytime! the best appetizer is the mashed potatoes! nothing can beat that :)"}
{"text":"I used to LOVE this place. I mean \"go there several times a week\" kind of love but lately it seems deals have decreased as well as portion sizes. I was addicted to their wings and would stock up on them regularly. The sad little party wings they serve now (For the same price mind you!) are actually kind of insulting."}
{"text":"Love this place, just good simple home cooking.  I can't get enough of the ribs, not overly smothered with BBQ sauce like at most place, for great price and Real fresh food."}
{"text":"Just good simple home cooking. When I can support family own business it make even better. I can't get enough of the ribs, not overly smothered with BBQ sauce like at most place, for great price and Real fresh food. Be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Great tasting chicken, a little expensive if you like to add on the sides. The sweet potatoes are delicious."}
{"text":"Honestly I don't have much to say about this place other than I've got a soft spot in my heart for rotisserie chicken. Sides are 'meh' (i had baked beans and pasta salad) but the chicken is delicious."}
{"text":"After many return visits I can't get enough of there chicken. Made fresh and always juicy. I now find it worth the price"}
{"text":"I have gone to this place multiple times and even though they get busy it is well worth the wait, their salads are amazing and their food is wonderful! Their meat is really fresh as well and they are really nice and helpful when I ask for advice on what to get!"}
{"text":"The service was good, the cashier was very patient and helped explain to us what various items on the menu were. The chicken tasted fresh and had that home cooked BBQ smell. The macaroni and cheese was probably my favorite part but the corn could of been a little more cooked."}
{"text":"Their food definitely won't disappoint. Nevada chicken is worth moving to Nevada for. :)) tasty good food!!"}
{"text":"I first tired Nevada Chicken Cafe at their location on Sahara Ave and found the chicken to be dry and the side dishes unappetizing.   After reading my review, the owner Nico invited me to the opening of his second location to give his food another try.   At this location, you stand in line and walk past the food before placing your order at the register. I handed the young female cashier my $25 gift card and she said today we have 30% off so you should save the card. I told her that I wanted to use the card today and she told me I was crazy. She seemed very inexperienced in handling customers.   I wanted to sit inside but the sewage smell was so bad I was forced to sit outside on a very hot day. My friend and I sampled the:  Breast meat- more moist than the other location but still bland and skin had a rubbery texture   Pulled pork sandwich- first pulled pork sandwich I have ever seen on sub sandwich bread. Pulled pork was finely chopped and red onions were random  Mac & cheese- bland, watery, the cheese tasted like it had come from a packet   Baked beans- artificially sweet, tasted like it came from a can  Coleslaw- average coleslaw, I have had better at the grocery store  Watermelon- mediocre  Chocolate chip cookie- hard and ordinary   Nico was busy but I wanted to ask him what inspired him to open a soul food like restaurant when it is not his culture.  Overall the food here is ordinary and the majority of it does not taste homemade."}
{"text":"Nevada Dry Chicken Cafe was an extreme disappoint from the chicken to the side dishes. I ordered the 1/4 chicken with spinach feta cheese pasta and sweet potatoes as my sides. Both of them tasted like cafeteria food. I exchanged them for the BBQ beans and the coleslaw which were definitely better. I will not be back because a restaurant that is named the chicken cafe should know how to properly cook their chicken."}
{"text":"We went for the ribs on Saturday evening at 8 pm.  Cashier told us they were out of ribs so we ordered chicken meal with dark pieces.  When we were served, it was white meat only and we asked about it, we were told they were out of the dark pieces.  They should have told us at the time we placed the order.  They just changed our order without asking.  Then, at 8:20 pm, they  were cleaning the adjacent tables with this intense cleaner and this was the last straw.  We won't go back."}
{"text":"The wraps, sides and smoothies are really good.  From the front it looks a little sketchy, but its really delicious chicken. One of my go to spots for healthy options."}
{"text":"OH MY GOD!   How can I start describing my experience at Nevada Chicken Cafe another way? It's just not possible! I first went there because I thought that a chicken wearing sun glasses in their logo was too bad ass for me not to try that place. Surprisingly, their chicken was hands down the best chicken I've ever tried! Hey, I been in Hawaii and their chicken wasn't as good as Nevada Chicken Cafe, so yeah here we go.  Nevada Chicken Cafe also offers you a healthy and fresh selection of vegetables, salads, druids and drinks! Of course their main dish is their Chicken, but you can also enjoy amazing pork and cow ribs! Particularly, I like to order their weekly selected combination combos that allows you to try both Chicken and ribs at a discounted price.   My favorite dis as Nevada Chicken Cafe is their 1/2 chicken & 1/4 pork ribs with a cucumber salad on the side, you shall also order their house sauce! Please let me know if you liked this dish because I'm just in love with it!!! If you like my review hit that like button and go get your bad ass Chicken! (This is currently my favorite Chicken in town, for you guys that follow me, remember to stay connected so that I can keep you informed;)"}
{"text":"First time here, so I got the leg-thigh chicken & rib combo with warm potato salad for $13.  Chicken was crispy-skin grilled goodness, but a really small portion that fit on 1 tortilla.    The 4 ribs were definitely not smoked on the cool mesquite BBQ they have walled off behind glass to the side -- you can feel the heat coming thru, but not smell the smoke. Well I also couldn't smell any mesquite smoke on my ribs, so I drown 2 of them in sauce and skipped the rest.    The best part of the meal was the oh so creamy warm and loving potato salad. Yum yum yum!   I'd drive here again to get a large side of the potato salad and eat it at home with my own smoked ribs."}
{"text":"Soo yum! I tried this place for the first time last week and had the pulled pink sandwich with a side of macaroni and cheese and it was delicious! The macaroni was the best I've had in a really long time and that pulled pork sandwich has coleslaw on it and is to die for! Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I love the chicken here, I come here pretty much every other day. It isn't too greasy, and you get your bang for your buck. Usually I come here at night, and the customer service is great! Staff is super nice, and attentive. Every time I go it is pretty clean. Definitely will still be a regular of this location."}
{"text":"Got a 30% off voucher so decided to check it out.  Got rib and chicken combo.  Choose mesquite chicken which was ok, ribs were Devine, oh my goodness they were yummy.  Was looking forward to roasted potatoes but they were out of them.  Sides of potato salad and Mac and cheese were both nice. Restaurant was clean and tidy and service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"I normally go to the Nevada Chicken cafe on Rainbow and 215, so since this was location was closer to me, I though I would give it a try. At the Rainbow and 215 location, I order the chicken and rib combo and it usually is two big pieces of chicken and some good size ribs because for the price, that's what you should get. But that wasn't the case at this location, which was disappointing to me. The chicken was small and cut in half so it looked even smaller and the ribs were tiny too. Needless to say I won't be going back to this location again. It's sad because the one on Rainbow and the 215 is really good and I'm never disappointed when I leave that location."}
{"text":"Rex is sentimental...if nothing else. Which of course as you know...makes Rex nothing else. One thing Rex loves is when old friends meet new friends.  Old Friend, sleeping off a bleach/ammonia high in a dumpster...meet New Friend...waking in the dumpster and finding an unused Groupon coupon. The sun was hot. The dumpster, or as I calling my \"mobile home\", was even hotter. The bad thing about \"mobile homes\" is that they are dirty, lumpy and usually smell like Kirstie Alley's bellybutton. The good thing is that sometimes you can meet someone and have a little...rendezvous. Guys...and I guess girls...if you meet a girl in a dumpster...there is a very good chance she is dead or easy...or both. Sometimes you might be tempted to hang in there if you realize that you are sharing it with a hooker who has a hacking cough. Don't. There are plenty of \"mobile homes\" out there.  TB and an empty wallet sucks.  So obviously some rich bastard who has things like a home, indoor plumbing and a vacuum that will vacuum the floors on its own just through out this little piece of gold like he does his underwear with holes in it. (which by the way...found a \"gently\" used pair of underwear. nice.)  Anyway, I was able to purchase 20 dollars of food from the Nevada Chicken Cafe. I started off on my long walk to what could potentially be...chicken nirvana.  I was about 2.3 miles away.  I got there 5 days later. It all started when I tried to walk an old lady across the street...and then...well...lets just say that it went wrong.  I did think that Scottsdale was nice.  When I did arrive at the Nevada Chicken Cafe, a lovely Dutchman pulled me the last 30 miles on a sled. (Long story...but you will always pay your debts to Rex...and Rex knows his Mel's Diner trivia.)  When Rex pulled up he was immediately struck by the smell. It was amazing. They had an outside grill/smoker going on and it was impressive. The chicken, ribs, spices, mesquite, all made me want to go in and order as much as I could.   Rex forced the Dutchman to order one whole chicken, one half chicken, a side of salad and it came with some BBQ sauce and tortillas. The tortillas were gratis. Gracias for the gratis. Rex found an empty mobile home and sat down with my feast. I was starving. Grave robbing is a lot more difficult than you would think. What is even more difficult is finding a landlord that will take a burial dress and skull in lieu of payment. Trust me...in Scottsdale no one has the kind of loot Princess Diana's had...not that Rex would know...anyway...  ...for the equivalent of 21.50 Rex was well fed. Rex fed well for 2 meals.  The chicken was excellent. The mesquite was subtle but flavorful. It didn't overpower the meat and was really good. The BBQ sauce is exceptional. Rex doesn't like an overly sweet sauce and this one isn't. It is well balanced and not too overpowering on the chicken. it works with the plain chicken better than the mesquite rubbed.  Rex was so impressed he has gone back several times and tried the ribs and some other sides.  The baby back ribs are among the best ribs in Las Vegas. They are fall off the bone and the extremely flavorful.  The St. Louis ribs are good, but they aren't great. Rex didn't love that it wasn't sauced enough. The sauce is sweeter and that is fine, but St. Louis ribs should be HEAVILY sauced...and these aren't.   The chicken...well...when done right it is the best. It is a excellent piece of chicken. The problem is that there is no consistency. Rex has had dry pieces and he has had perfect pieces...and this is a MAJOR issue. If you are only doing a few things they have to be perfect. In fairness I have had more good than bad...but I have had enough bad to not necessarily want the crap shoot when I am paying good grave robbing money.   The sides are were everything falls apart.  The Mac and Cheese...and Rex loves the mac and cheese...isn't good. Under seasoned (the only thing that is), and mash potatoes are so peppery it is of the charts. Rex loves pepper. He would roll himself in pepper and find a nice salt covered girl to mix with...but this is too much pepper. The fruit salad wasn't cleaned as well (the tough pieces) as it should be, and the mixed veggies were okay, but nothing great.  The black beans were okay, but again nothing to write home about and didn't taste like they were simmered in a rich enough stock. The sweet potatoes were a real stand out and should be eaten as the side.   A huge special shout out for the garlic ranch sauce...get a few tubs of it. perfect with the chicken and the salad. Amazing taste.   Rex has dated his fair share of unstable women. It adds a little spice. A little mystery. A little arousal. Eventually no matter how good post release from jail sex can be...it is time to go.  In his eateries Rex demands stability. Consistency. Reliability. Excellence. Rex is all of those things and more.  Spend your money and time on a shrine to Rex. He will spend his money on gas and whores."}
{"text":"Chicken was delicious, so flavorful and juicy!!! Mac & cheese was the best, according to our 6 year old. All of the other sides we had (potatoes, baked beans and corn) were just as delicious. Mr Amir went out of his way to make sure that our meal was to our liking!  Looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"Maybe perhaps I don't get out much, but expensive as hell ....small combo for $14.00 w/ tax, chicken was good, ribs were old, cold ,hard and super tough. All the Mexican employees are super nice and sweet. Clean tables too"}
{"text":"I honestly don't understand all these negative reviews. I am a super picky eater and I loved the food here. The spice rub on the spare ribs and the chicken were SO good! It reminded me of the home cooked BBQ I had when I was younger. The BBQ sauce was also really good although I like mine a little more acidic. The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the mashed potatoes but I couldn't put my finger on what I didn't like about it other than the fact that they just didn't taste right. But the potato salad was to die for!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place, I love the sweet potato and chicken, the green mix salad and the atmosphere. Nice place to grab a quick lunch."}
{"text":"This place was awesome I got the chicken and ribs combo and I enjoyed them both very much that coupled with the discount made it amazingly worth it I would highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"These are one of those places I did not bookmark, but was hungry that I had to eat something, so I don't faint and end up being saved by somebody I potentially would NOT call a knight in shining armor... in Vegas... where they're probably just in costume cuz they work at Tournament of Kings in the Excalibur Hotel.  My point, this chicken served here kinda reminded me of the food plates served at that dinner show. I wonder if they order from here. Skimpy wimpy warm salad and no need for the tortilla. But the mashed potatoes a must! Can get a whole rotisserie chicken for less elsewhere - price comparison reasons. However, chicken was good. Nicely seasoned.   Aromatic food smells from the outside. The kind that makes my hair smell like BBQ. Don't take my idea up on that; I doubt it's appealing as a shampoo scent. May I suggest though, do try their chicken and mashed potatoes!"}
{"text":"Not bad chicken was good but I felt it overpriced for the portions and tables were dirty. Staff was pleasant. I would go back if price dropped."}
{"text":"Great food. Friendly staff Amir is always upbeat and polite. They keep the restaurant and bathrooms super clean. I been here several times. My favorite location"}
{"text":"It was our first time here. It was eh. The cashier didn't really pay full attention to us, she kept talking to her other coworkers in the back. Then when in the middle of taking our order, she interrupted us  that she'll be right back and talked to her coworkers again. As for the food, I didn't expect the rice to be orange, we thought it was going to be regular white rice, so maybe they should make that clearer on the menu. However, the chicken and ribs we got was good.  Honestly wouldn't really come back again."}
{"text":"So it's 5:30 on a Friday and no ribs!!  Wtf, 45 minutes til they have any.  So I ordered the chicken and 2 sides.  Didn't ReAlly want chicken but oh well.  Smelled good on the outside grill.  I go to the condiments and both bbq sauce bottles are empty.  A real disappointment, I'll let you know how the chicken was.  10 minutes later they refilled the bbq sauce, lol."}
{"text":"We've passed here for several years and have always wanted to check it out.  They grill they chicken outdoors and you can smell the delicious smoke from blocks away.   We finally tried it today and we were very disappointed.    We ordered the family meal.  Full chicken, rack of ribs, and three sides.   The chicken was dry.  The ribs were okay...tasted like they were boiled.   And the sides were mediocre.  The family meal was $50.   They have one flavor of BBQ sauce.  It tasted like regular KC Masterpiece.  They had one hit sauce, which tasted like Frank's Red Hot.    Service was good.  Location was convenient.  Food was mediocre.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Is not as fresh as before, the chicken is cold and like is been sitting out for a good time.  They kinda over price now for quality they offer."}
{"text":"Very good chicken.  I got the 1/4 white, mesquite charcoal grilled.  It was very good and tasty.  The service was also very fast and friendly and it was very clean inside the restaurant.  The downsides of it were that I thought for $8 for the 1/4 white, one flour tortilla and a side of sweet potatoes was a little pricey.  I was still a little hungry when I was finished.  I wasn't impressed with sweet potatoes either.  They had WAY TOO MUCH cinnamon in them.  I normally only like a little brown sugar and butter with mine. The other sides look very tasty and I hope to try them again soon.  I'll definitely eat here again.  I'll just order more food next time."}
{"text":"Chicken and rib combo is amazing! Ribs have a great rub and don't need sauce (although that's really good as well). Chicken is excellent as well. Very moist and cooked perfectly. Even the sides are on point.   Only complaint is they don't offer the nutrition info at all on the website or in store."}
{"text":"There food is always fresh. It feel like your eating a good home cooked meal! My food is always ready when I call for pick up. All of there staff members are super nice"}
{"text":"I came across this place by accident and now i go so much that the girls know my name when I start placing my order.  the food is always tasty and fresh. FYI, go right before noon... It gets jam packed in there."}
{"text":"Got a chicken breast/wing and some ribs today. The food was outstanding! Way better than alot of the other chicken places out there. Definitely a return visit!"}
{"text":"Staff doesn't have it together yet but the food is on point. Look for their coupons for BOGO and try the mesquite chicken. I know go figure...try the chicken at Nevada chicken cafe but seriously good stuff.  Hope it makes it because this location doesn't seem to hold a food place for long."}
{"text":"This place has the absolute WORST service in any restaurant in all of the Las Vegas valley!  We had this delivered to our offices and it was pretty decent.  Ribs are super meaty, like twice the amount of meat than their local competitors.  Chicken and sides and wraps were just ok.  I figured I'd go the the restaurant and see what the food is like when it's fresh.  HUGE mistake!  The line was long due to a clearly incompetent cashier who had no business operating an electronic device.  The register was way too much technology for her and had to punch in everyone's orders at least twice.  We order and go find a seat.  There were lots of open seats, but they weren't cleaned off from the previous customers.  Nearly the entire dining room had not been bussed.  We and other customers had to ask repeatedly to have someone come and bus the tables because there was no clean tables to sit on.  The cashier begrudgingly went back and asked someone to clean off the table and gave an attitude that transled to: \"Why are you even bothering me? That's not even my job.\".The tables finally were bussed and we got seated.   25 minutes went by and my kids are antsy at this point.  We're all hungry and want to eat already.  Other customers looked agitated too.  35 minutes go by and some guy I'm assuming is the manager is going from table to table talking to the customers that are still waiting on their orders and I can see some of them getting visibly upset.  The guy gets to us and asks if it's okay if we wait another 20 minutes. WHAT THE F? He said they ran out of ribs.  How do you run out of ribs at a rib joint?  THAT'S ALL YOU DO! Why didn't the cashier say something before I ordered?  F this, I'm not waiting an hour to eat. I go to the register to demand a refund and find a long line of customers also wanting a refund.  Remember the incompetent cashier from earlier?  I think her brain exploded from trying to figure out how to do a refund on a card transaction because she simply gave up and started refunding credit card transactions in cash to the nearest dollar instead.  I'm pretty sure she got fired for being short on her register count at the end of the night.    Well that just about nails it. I'm not ever going to this place again, and I suggest Yelpers not go there either.  Get it delivered if you're jonesing for mediocre BBQ, but don't ever set foot in the place."}
{"text":"Although the to-go service was fast and friendly, I was slightly turned off by the food. The rotisserie chicken was a little pink in the middle of the drumsticks, and the BBQ sauce drowned the ribs a bit. The cucumber salad wasn't all that and could stand to use some spices."}
{"text":"I went here on my break& once I went through the door, only one person greeted me which was the cashier.  I mean if youre a slightly new restaurant, you should try to get as much good feedback as you can on customer service,yeah? Anyways, once I was in the restaurant , the lady cleaning the tables was just staring at me.. Like okay what are you staring at? I ordered my food & I asked the girl at the cashier how long it would take,she said 5 minutes&  I was like cool , I have enough time to enjoy my food on my break instead of rushing to eat.. So she gave me my number& I sat down. 5 minutes..10 minutes.. 15 minutes passed & still nothing. Even during that time the lady that was cleaning came around & gave me a deep stare again?! Like geez..I noticed the lady even packing the food kept talking to the other employees.. She finally gave me my food & she didnt even say thank you come again she kinda just slammed my order my table & took my number.   But once I ate the 6 piece bbq chicken wings.. It was SO GOOD. The bbq sauce was amazing!   i wouldve gave 5 stars but customer service needs to be better&the extended time wait should actually be near of what it actually is.."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch since my office is less than 10 minutes away.  I had seen it many times while driving by and had been intrigued but never went in before.  When I finally decided to pull the trigger, it reminded me of a cafeteria where you look at the sides you want.  The chicken appears to be cooked daily so at least the food is fresh.  I ordered the dark chicken.  It was tasty but nothing spectacular.  With a side, the meal was a little less than $10.  I thought it was too pricey for the quality, but the portions were pretty solid.  You could definitely get away with creating at least one and a half meals, maybe two if you had two sides.  I do not need to go back to Nevada Chicken Cafe anytime soon, but I would not have an automatic response of no if someone wanted to go."}
{"text":"Loved the chicken!  The mesquite grilled chicken was fabulous!  Love all the different kinds of bbq sauce they serve it with.  Ribs were good as well.  They are served with a dry rub and you add your own bbq sauce if you want.  We got the family meal for 4, and there was plenty of food leftover!!!  The Caesar salad was good as well.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars was the Mac n cheese was not edible.  It had a very strange taste and was gritty.  Our order was to go or I would have asked for something else.  Overall though I was really impressed, and will definitely go back!!!"}
{"text":"My friend recommended this place. We tried it last weekend and it did not disappoint. I had the California wrap. It was very tasty. I need to go back and try the ribs. They looked and smelled tasty!"}
{"text":"First and not last stop here, was in the neighborhood and decided to stop after seeing the outside grill and of course the grill smell is a favorite. Entering the establishment right away the ribs in full view being cooked in rotisserie fashion enter the ordering line with all food in full sight.   Clean and the freshness of that food now has me anticipating...ordered sat and wait time minimal to receive order, I had a combo baked beans and salad and also at the table a bbq sandwich... Now the sandwich was a surprise of a mountain on the roll with slaw... Myself, I do not care for a soggy sandwich so pass,, But the combo made up with the Rotisserie style ribs... NO SAUCE NEEDED,salad FRESH, beans had a zing to them that I liked.... all in all in my opinion and observation, the quality of the cooking far outreached other bbq establishments that charge  a while lot more and yet the flavor and enjoyment did not match.... cant wait to go again....."}
{"text":"I don't go to this location very often...so I can't really comment on the service etc. But I do use these guys a lot for catering for my work. Nico the owner is always extremely helpful in this regard. Him and the staff always help get the order in and make sure everything is on time. I would highly recommend for your catering needs.  They also have a new location on 215/rainbow opening up soon. As far as the food goes...I love their rotisserie chicken, salad mashed potatoes and mac n cheese. I have never gotten any complaints when I use these guys. Give em a try."}
{"text":"The chicken is super bomb the waitstaff are super nice customer service is super excellent love this place every time after lunch will be here"}
{"text":"Great tasting food. Chicken and ribs are juicy. The pulled pork sandwich is my favorite. The price is fare and a $5.00 check-in offer with Yelp is perfect. The side selection is are nice; from beans to fresh fruit. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"So used to be my favorite, went min ounce a week, over the last year the price has gone up and portions much much smaller. To much$ for what they are giving."}
{"text":"Got a $5 coupon & decided to check it out. Could smell the meat cooking from outside and the aromas made my mouth water.   I wasn't in the mood for ribs even though that's what everyone told me to get. I saw a lot of people on yelp say chicken was dry...they offer grilled or rotisserie. I asked the girl at the counter what was best for juicy. She said the rotisserie was juicier because skin holds in moisture better. Sounded good to me so hubby and I ordered 1/2 chicken, paid $3 more for white meat. Added three sides for $8 - Mac n cheese, mashed potatoes gravy and black beans. With coupon total was $11.99.  Delivered to our table in less than five min. Chicken was hot & juicy and cooked to perfection. Sauce choices were limited to two: BBQ or hot. Tried BBQ which was just okay. Sides were hot and tasted good. Mashed potatoes had skins in it and gravy was okay so I probably won't order again. If you like white mild cheese then you will love the macaroni n cheese ( I'm a sharp cheddar girl myself). Black beans were excellent! Our meal came with two warm tortillas and a small vinaigrette salad which was a nice surprise.  I am giving this review four stars today subject to change based on my next visit. It is clean, cute, TVs are a nice touch. I hope the owner adds more sauce and spice choices easily ready at tables. I look forward to ribs, broccoli salad and pulled pork sandwiches in my future here. It's way better than fast food. Suggestion: go with a coupon and give it a chance..."}
{"text":"Good, clean, fast, nice staff, healthy options and guilty pleasures make this place perfect for quick meals for me.  It dawned on me, as I walked in the door that the smell is heaven and it's so yummy, what am i gonna order and whaaat?....First time checking in? NO WAY, I come here a lot and apparently am too distracted to remember to check in.  So for my \"first time\" I got $5 off yelp deal. Sweet! I went with the pulled pork sandwich, cold chicken salad and a DIET green tea to make myself feel better about gorging myself at lunch.  Cashier super nice paid, took my number, had a seat in front of TV with soccer on. Three minutes later food arrived. I'm not sure what happened after I took pic of my food but I looked down and it was magically gone. I suppose I should have slowed down but I never do.  Pulled pork sandwich perfectly sauced with the BBQ and slaw...soft roll made it extra delish. Cold chicken salad pretty good but sauce a little sweet for me.  Only disappointed they are limited on BBQ sauce choices but the garlic sauce is tasty I could put it on everything...  I will of course be back and try to get better about checking in!"}
{"text":"Good restaurant, good value  Come in during lunch or dinner rush or the chicken will not be fresh off the grill.  The jasmine rice is fantastic. Grilled veggies great. Fast service.   You will like this place. Choice of dark or while meat.  The music is the low point. You must listen to commercials and the exact same bad song every day. Something about a cell phone.   The service is great, smiles and perfectly trained staff- top notch people at all branches. The best part of this company-Staff."}
{"text":"Another wonderful experience at Nevada Chicken Cafe last night.  Definitely our favorite place to go for BBQ chicken...SO DELICIOUS!  Best baked beans and coleslaw too!  The staff is so courteous and friendly.  Keep up the excellent customer service and great food!"}
{"text":"I love the food here! Everything I've ever had has impressed me. The main dishes, the sides, everything. DELISH. The service, however, definitely leaves a LOT to be desired. Tonight, we waited a while at the register before anyone even said hello. And the food took a while to come out. We ordered from here last month for a work function. When I came to pick it up, they had lost my entire order. They gave me a 10% discount for the inconvenience, but come on!"}
{"text":"food isn't cheap. but they have great coupons! Good food!  Killer salads!"}
{"text":"FIRST TIME HERE! Wow! I ordered 1/4 ribs plus a side, which is supposed to get 3 ribs but I somehow got lucky to get a 4th ( sssh don't tell hahaha)  The BBQ sauce at the bar added to the experience but the spices alone on the ribs were terrific! I got a side of mashed potatoes which was delicious! My only problem was... why the tortilla? I was so confused by a tortilla on my plate with ribs, this isn't a complaint but a confusion... just why?  Our service was great, it was clean and oh so delicious. I will be back again and again but please someone explain to me the random tortilla with my ribs... please..? Haha thank you for a delicious meal regardless of random tortilla.."}
{"text":"They need better management. Looks like the cooks don't help each other or know what they are doing or how to handle food. Wait time is very long, looks like staff is left unattended or its a family run business, food quality ehhhh"}
{"text":"I've lived in Nevada for almost three years now; driven by numerous times seeing the smoker. Tonight, I finally decided to drop in -- this is one of those reviews for me that is hard to write. I know a person's review is their own opinion but I try to always be fair about the things that I write.  When I walked in I was surprised to see a fast food like environment. I wanted to try both the chicken and the ribs, so she sold me a \"combination plate\" this consisted of one small piece of chicken. I requested White meat, three small ribs a childlike side dish -- I chose the chicken pasta a very small salad and a small beverage.  I would rate the food as \"good\" but not worth the cost; especially for the portion size provided. I initially ordered my meal to be consumed in a restaurant. Within five minutes of my food being delivered, they got a rush of people in. The place is too small to have any kind of comfort while eating. I then asked for a to go box.  Will I go back? MAYBE... I know that at those prices, it can't be a regular place to dine. Three or four times a year perhaps. It will definitely be take out though."}
{"text":"Everything about my experience here was only okay! The service was ok as well as the food. So first off the cashier gets kind of smart with me because I was taking a long time to order. This may have been understandable if there was a line but there was no one behind me and my friend and this was my first visit. I feel like this was such a missed opportunity for the cashier to give suggestion and guide me through the menu but he was to busy watching the football game on the tv to care about my experience.    I ended up ordering one piece of roasted chicken and one piece smoked. The smoked chicken was better than the roasted but both were nothing special to me. I also had a side of Mac and cheese and a side of fruit. The mixed fruit was well fruit so I can't complain. The Mac and cheese was not good to me at all. It lacked flavor and was just not appealing to me. Overall, not my cup of tea and I won't be back."}
{"text":"It's just OK.  The service was ho-hum and the dining room wasn't the cleanest.  My macaroni & cheese was rather bland.  The meats were nice (ribs & chicken).  Plenty of meat on the bones plus a great smokiness-- this isn't fake BBQ.  Pricing was a little high for fast casual but a Yelp check-in offer made it a good deal.  It's not bad but I think I'd just go to Chipotle next time."}
{"text":"I drop by here occasionally when I can't decide whether I want chicken or ribs. Here you can get both in a combo! I would grade the quality as decent, and a good value for what you pay. If you're looking for top of the line chicken or ribs, then you probably want to go somewhere else, but this place is a great lunch option, and I really like the variety of sides available with each combo. The sauces are decent, and I like that the staff is business like and don't chat very much."}
{"text":"First off let me say that I read the reviews here and was like okay it's either going to be great or not good. Either way I was okay about it because I had a restaurant.com coupon that let me spend $50 for $25. Another reason I was concerned was because I was taking my two picky eating boys with us for lunch. Well I can say that we were happy and enjoyed our meal. We had full rack of ribs, whole chicken, mac n cheese, garlic roasted potatoes, and mashed potatoes and gravy. The kids loved the sides. Me and hubby not so much...but the chicken and ribs were great. They seasoning on the meat was great. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I wanted to try the wings but they were out and wouldn't have them made for one hour. Even after that hour he told us the wings they made were for other people. So one good thing you would have to do is come early or order ahead of time. But I loved the place. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in just to try it. Amazed with the freshness and flavors. I hope the business stays great and the doors are open here for a long time!"}
{"text":"Okay now given that this is called Nevada CHICKEN Cafe.  I will say that I thought the chicken was good.  I opted for the dry rubbed mesquite bbq.  Not the best, but not terrible.  My problem, however, is the sides.  Oh sweet chicken cafe...mac & cheese should not be fluorescent orange...and corn grows from the ground...not out of cans.   Seriously...if I dined in, I would've traded them in as a previous yelper mentioned they did.  I was not that lucky.  I imagine this would be what it would feel like to have pork rinds with sushi.  Fail."}
{"text":"Seasoned to the bone. Love it. I back the next day it's so damn good  if you live or visit this place is a must eat"}
{"text":"Everyday that I come out of the gym at PF I'm met with the same protruding, wonderful smell....The smell of BBQ chicken. I always wanted to try it out. So, I got a hankering for BBQ chicken the other day, and decided to see what they were all about.   I walked into a clean, welcoming restaurant. They had a pretty extensive menu. The nice thing is everything seemed so healthy. I ended up getting the \"Waldorf Chicken Salad.\" This salad was huge. Everything was so fresh. It had grapes, celery, peppers, tomoatoes, walnuts, etc., everything a good salad should have.   I also ended up getting three pieces of dark meat to save for dinner, the mesquite flavored. The chicken was delicious. It was moist and tender.  I really don't have any complaints. I thought the service was fine. I was in and out around 5 minutes. Overall, great place to eat and not too pricey for what you're getting."}
{"text":"This place used to be good now they are terrible. Almost 30 minutes to get our order, food was cold and quality is definitely not what it used to be. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"WHy had I NOT gone here?!?!?!? This 'ish is GOOD! I had the dark meat chicken 3 piece special, because darker the berry the sweeter the juice (KUDOS if you know what movie that's from!) along with the cucumber salad.  The chicken was SO good and tender that it literally slipped off the bone! The cucumber salad was SO refreshing and crisp! I think I'll make this one of my go-to places!"}
{"text":"Great food pretty fast on the service end too. Got the chicken and ribs special was delicious and juicy."}
{"text":"Very tasty chicken and mesquite grilled ribs.  Didn't care for the Mac and cheese too much.  I exchanged the Mac and cheese for mashed potatoes which were good.  The attitude the employee gave me wasn't nice.  The ribs were a little chewy and dry for my taste but the dry rub was tasty.  There were very few parking places. But that isn't their fault.  I was surprised to see that the one employee who had a bad attitude parked his black fiat right out front in the ONLY AVAILABLE  space and that was annoying.  The parking spots near the front should be for guests and not employees.  The other employees were very nice.  I'm not sure if I will go back."}
{"text":"Terrible,  Really disappointed.  First try, cjhicken wrap had a big bone in it and grissle  gross!  the owner invited us to come back comped but we went in on our own as we werent' looking for a freebie.  second try, bbq'd chicken.  The chicken was so dry couldn't swallow it, waited forever to get it, send it back and waited again long time, same result.  Doused it in bbq sauce that was not very good.  We live nearby and like organic but would not go back and not recommend it.  Terrible food."}
{"text":"My second time here and we'll reading these reviews I don't believe these people. Have a little patience for a new restaurant. Our first experience was great, and so was this one. The staff is nice as can be we ordered to-go and literally 5 mins later our food was ready. That fast we were shocked! The reviews complain about timing. Don't kill a place just cause you didn't stuff your face in 5 mins. Enjoy your food. Let it savor and let the sauce just over take your taste buds. This place deserves a good review not angry women hating for having no patience. I have no patience and this place sure did not waste my time."}
{"text":"I used to eat here OFTEN at least 3 times a week.  However ever since they branched out their quality on Sahara and jones has deteriorated.   Today I stopped to get some items for my son who is sick.  One item was chicken Caesar salad white meat only.  I got iceberg lettuce and croutons.  That's it.  The chicken soup I ordered also has no chicken in it.  This is not unusual sadly - but every other time I think \"they are just off\".  Well I'm done thinking that.  I'm not sure I will go back."}
{"text":"Exceptionally clean, great value for the money, clean taste, friendly staff, immediate response by the staff.... you may be here for the first time, but I know you'll be back for many more"}
{"text":"Mike is awsome !!!!!! He always has the best chicken and ribs !!! I love the additude and the great feeling i get in the cafe from the employees. Everybody was nice and im coming back soon"}
{"text":"I'm always excited to try a new place and on my way to my favorite chai(located right next door) I decided to try NCC. I had the 1/4 rib, leg and thigh combo which comes with one side and a drink. The sides are the exciting part of the experience but due to dieting I couldn't try the ones I really wanted(Mac and cheese, mashed with gravy..etc) so I decided on the cole slaw. It was very dry and bland. Tasted like there was no salt or any seasoning for that matter and barely any mayo or vinegar, couldn't tell what style it was. The chicken was just ok, nothing to run back to for. The ribs were the best part of the visit. A decent amount of meat and packed with flavor. They put a cup of BBQ sauce on the side for dipping but I like them dry. I will be back to give them another try or go to their other location that has been open longer."}
{"text":"Customer service is severely lacking- the signs show \" whole chicken\" under family meals but when we asked for the discount allowed for family meals, we were told the whole chicken is not part of the deal- although is is in the column marked \" family meals\".  The woman behind the counter was abrupt and rude - we ordered the whole chicken anyway- once home, we found 2 legs, 2 wings, 2 thighs - no breasts- this is not a whole chicken.  Pieces were so tiny- must have been a pigeon!! The inside of the restaurant was filthy - floors were sticky nope not going back"}
{"text":"We came in for lunch expecting a juicy chicken and ribs- it was a disappointment, both are dry and warm. The inner chicken breast meat was even cold to touch. It seems as it was grilled the day before. The same thing with the ribs ,very dry and tough and cold. The baby green salad was very unappetizing that it supposed to be cold but it was warm and wilted( open the bag, spray a little bit of water, keep in ref. overnight, mix with chopped romaine and iceberg the next day and serve!) it's probably our last time here."}
{"text":"Besides the smell of chemicals flowing through the building my food was good. Please do not mop the whole restaurant while I'm eating. Gross"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this restaurant... it's a cross between El Pollo Loco & a BBQ joint.  The service is quite fast & I totally appreciate that, especially when I need a quick bite to eat during my lunch break. The flavor of their food is good, but I'm not completely in love with it.  Their serving size is enough, but when you're so used to being over fed at other restaurants, the portion size here may appear a bit small.   Nonetheless, I'd still come here every now & then."}
{"text":"Have eaten NCC dine and and carryout .   The Fast casual style is hard to master in the BBQ realm because the meats are usually smoked for extended periods of time . NCC does an ok job at this .   Service - fast casual counter ordering was quick .   Food- we got the rib and chicken combo which the ribs were a little dry not moist at all . Would not get the ribs again . The chicken was ok . It seems as f they want you to drown it in the BBQ sauces . The sides are good , the Mac and cheese was not over cheesy but very good . The vegetable soup was the best part of the meal .   Overall - for quick BBQ it may hit the spot . Other sit down BBQ spots are better."}
{"text":"I've been to Nevada chicken cafe twice. Two separate locations. The first time, I got ribs and they we a 5 out of 10. Wasn't impressed with anything I ordered. That was 4 years ago. I recently went back because I wanted chicken and happen to drive by. I ordered 1/4 chicken and a side of sautéed vegetables. It was delicious! The chicken was seasoned perfectly and juicy. The vegetables had amazing flavor. So happy I stopped back in.. but I'll be sticking to the chicken!"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time yesterday. I read some of the negative reviews on here before coming so I didn't set my expectations high.   I ordered the Monday special which is 1/2 chicken, 1 side and 1 drink. I thought the chicken tasted good and the 1 side dish of mashed potatoes was adequate. I do agree with other reviews that the chicken size could be bigger but its no different from the size you get at el pollo loco. I was full walking out. If I ordered the 1/4 chicken I would probably have still been hungry.   I would eat here again."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing the sauce is to die for the place is really clean and the staff is incredibly nice!!!  Great job what a nice family restaurant to have a nice reasonably priced meal!!!"}
{"text":"selling raw chicken, also found a bone in my wrap that chipped my tooth!!!!  do not come here, you will get food poisoning. be warned!"}
{"text":"Nevada Chicken Cafe is probably the most reliably delicious, fresh and healthy spots to eat in Las Vegas. You'll often find a staff member outside at the grill roasting chicken and filling the block with its wonderful smells. It's quick service, so you order & pay for your food, and you can dine in or get your food to go.   They offer chicken platters ranging from whole toasted chicken to single pieces of legs thighs and more, they have wraps, salads and more. Almost all dishes come with at least one side dish which are all very yummy with a large variety from healthy fruit to heavy Mac and cheese or potato's.   Most menu items cost between $9-13  I find myself constantly craving Nevada chicken cafe when I need a quick, well balanced meal on the go!"}
{"text":"Just ordered a late lunch from here. I had to send my coworker to pick it up since delivery wasn't available today..? Despite it being listed on their website as an option. It's strange because pretty much every time I've tried to order from here, they say delivery is unavailable... So, when exactly is delivery available? Had to knock a star off for that one, unfortunately...  Besides that confusion, Nevada Chicken Cafe is pretty tasty. Coworker ordered one of the rib + chicken combos and practically inhaled the whole meal in a matter of minutes. My chicken caesar wrap was also good. The highlight of my meal was the side baked beans I got with it. So yummy!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a late lunch here with my friends. The service was great and the food tasted great. Darla, the cashier, was very sweet and enthusiastic! Great location!"}
{"text":"This location is located right next to Chipotle in the busy Arroyo shopping plaza. I visited this establishment on opening day since a group of my co-workers were excited to give it a try. I have never visited the Sahara location and this was my first time trying it out. There was obvious 1st day hiccups. For example: cashiers stressed out and forgetting items ( they were trying their best so I can't knock em' for that) and missing items from orders at my table (most were corrected).   I ordered the 1/4 Chicken w/ two sides- watermelon and sweet potatoes. The chicken was the star of the plate. It was pretty good and grilled just right. The watermelon was fresh and sweet. However, the sweet potato was so-so.  I also sampled my co-workers Mac & Cheese and it was super bland w/ watery cheese (really bad).   Pros-  I like that they use Organic Chicken    I like they have fresh ingredients for sides (like my watermelon)  Fast and relatively healthy options ( you order/pay at counter and sit and wait for food)  Cons- sides were a hit or miss.... Sweet Potatoes were - Meh Mac & Cheese- Gross  Overall, I like the concept and my chicken. Perhaps this site will improve with time and hammer our some opening hiccups.  Also, my co-workers all seemed to enjoy their meals. Thus, I give them a solid 3 stars. I would come back and order the chicken and just be picky about what sides I would order."}
{"text":"Always the best experience! Darla was great at greeting us and quickly processing our order."}
{"text":"So there was a lot of buzz about the Nevada chicken cafe at the office so a few of us stopped out for lunch. The place was very clean which scores a lot of points with me, however it was not enough to earn more than 2 stars from me.   I tried the 1/4 chicken with the 2 sides of  mashed potatoes and gravy and the feta and spinach pasta.   First and foremost, the chicken was dry and the portion was pretty weak. (maybe i just got a wimpy chicken) others that were eating the same thing looked much better and bigger than the one I got. The chicken is similar (but not as good as) the little rotisserie chickens you can buy at Von's or Smith's. The only two things that set it apart from said grocery store chicken, is that Nevada Chicken cafe's chicken is dryer and there is a little bit of a citrus taste on the skin.   The mashed potatoes were not to different from KFC's mashed potatoes. Not all that great....and finally the pasta, if there was feta cheese on that i would like to know where it was. I love feta cheese and could not notice it in the pasta at all. It was actually pretty bland which was very disappointing.  Other than the food, the place was clean, the staff seemed nice and we got our food quickly.    I may give the place one more try in the future just with lower expectations."}
{"text":"Nevada chicken cafe is one of my family's favorite healthy fast food restaurants. They told me that their chicken is organic. I was like, \"jackpot!\" My man took me here one day because I was craving corn on the cob.   The corn on the cob was so good! I love the flavor of the roasted chicken. They also have ribs if you like that. I really enjoy the chicken & their wraps. They have nice t.v.'s so you can watch sports while you're in there.   They serve beer as well but I'm not much of a drinker so I didn't bother to remember what kind they sell.  Whenever we eat there, someone is always asking how everything was & if we need anything. That's really nice that they care.   Now, the past times that I've gone in there, they remember me & my baby. Maybe because we're starting to become regulars. I just have to say that they are really nice & friendly at Nevada Chicken Cafe. Makes you feel welcome to come back.  I was reading their to go menu & I noticed that it said that they delivered too. That's good to know for me being a busy mom & all. Of course I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Ive been 3 times in a span of 5 days. Huge hit and miss in terms of quality. I suggest avoid going there after 2pm and just go there for the lunch rush when theyve made the chicken right off the grill. The last time it was incredibly dry and their sides were below par from the first 2 times i went.   Consistency in quality and taste would have gotten this a 5 star."}
{"text":"First time to nevada chicken and  the ribs were bomb! I had chicken as well it was ok nothing I would get again but we had mac and cheese as a side dish horrible worst mac and cheese I've had"}
{"text":"I first found the other location years ago and have loved it. I'm not even a huge fan of chicken, but I love their chicken and ribs. I just visited this location again today, and I forgot my phone and wallet. I returned later for it and all of the cash and everything was exactly where I left it. I'm very grateful to them and an even bigger fan now"}
{"text":"Not the best I've ever had.  Maybe they serve better cuts to the celebrities that visit.   It took nearly 10 min before anyone acknowledged us.  Then the staff was friendly and attentive.   My chicken Caesar was gobbed with dressing and had dry chicken.  The up side was, my husband forgot to order my salad without croutons so they offered to remake the whole dish.  I declined but later wished I had said yes.  I bit into a small bone and a quarter if the dish was croutons.   The ribs were good (but dry) and the mac and cheese was ech.  UPDATE:  the peperonchinis made my family seriously gassy, etc.  Glad I didn't eat them."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about this place, and after a workout, decided this was the place to try for the protein needs. It wasn't bad. Honestly, I'd like to come back here and try a few more things. My wife ordered the pork sandwich and for me personally, the bbq sauce was too sweet. It needed more kick and maybe some smokiness to offset the sugar content.   I had the the bbq chicken sandwich with the coleslaw. The chicken was good, moist and tender...the slaw was not so good. I do not like dry slaw and this was drrrrrryyyyyyy. Creamy is where it's at otherwise it's just cabbage.  Service was good though, you order at the counter and they bring your food to you."}
{"text":"The best chicken ! So much better than going to el pollo loco ! Great selection of healthy sides and wonderful customer service!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible. Deliciously simple. Chicken, ribs, BBQ, pulled port sandwiches, all the sides you can imagine. It's like they took this place right out of the south and dropped it on W. Sahara. This place is absolutely phenomenal and is a huge hidden secret within Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is Awesome. Fresh and great BBQ. Great customer service. Trust me when you going vegas you have to try Nevada Chicken Cafe I got Ribs and chicken and Side of Macaroni and red rice  Yumiiii. Warm welcoming by staff. This place is busy but if you wait even 20 min or half hours is Worth each Penny trust me i wish had one here in San Jose."}
{"text":"I tried it out with the restaurant.com card and it was INCREDIBLE DELICIOUS. The seasoning is just perfect (right amount of everything). This will be my first time of many more!!!"}
{"text":"This place is literally finger licking good! Came here for lunch on Saturday and got 2 pieces of chicken and 3 ribs and was absolutely blown away. And the fact that it was only 10 bucks blew my mind. I'm officially addicted, coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Good food. Good service. Tucked away and not the easiest place to find. Good sides. Mac n cheese was good."}
{"text":"Super..super... super...delicious!!! Every time I go there it's great!!! Food is as fresh as it could be & hot off the grill \"literally\"!! The staff is very helpful!!"}
{"text":"This place has good chicken.  I haven't tried the sides, but I give it 4 stars for the chicken.  The customer service is ok.  It doesn't seem like anyone here will go out of the way to make you happy.  If you want good chicken at a decent price, come here.  It kind of reminds me of Boston Market, but with less options on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is over priced for a fast food joint Mac and cheese is bland can't taste cheese at all , mashed potato is ok,  BBQ ribs and chicken just average. I was hoping this place has something different to offer. Very Disappointed :( I wish I used my check-in for $10 off"}
{"text":"I have been going to the original Sahara and Jones location for years.  Since the very first day I moved to Vegas to be exact and I always loved it.  When I saw this location open next to my home I was super excited.  Unfortunately as I'm sitting here I am very disappointed.  This location does not cook their chicken like the real place, they don't have the same sides and the silubsitiute sides they have suck.  I usually eat heir mashed potatoes and corn by the gallon but they don't even have the corn here.  It's this disgusting grilled corn on the cob nothing like the original.    It seems to be more like a fast food place now.  I wish they would have duplicated their original store instead of lowering standards.  I'm upset."}
{"text":"I clearly stated on the comment section for the wings for the sauce for it to be on the side . When I got my order the wings where drenched in BBQ sauce. I called and the woman who answered the the phone told me to just reorder it but I'm not going to pay again for the restaurants mistake so I called back at least 5 times and no one answer, I wish I can upload a picture of my call log , so it can be seen So unprofessional the lady was The whole point of UBEREATS is to get our food delivered, this was a very unpleasant experience  Epic fail! I wouldn't eat here again! Staff clearly doesn't know how to answer a phone! Nobody ever answers! And obviously don't know how to read precise instructions for an order!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food here, it's one of my favorite joints. Unfortunately, today I'm giving this place 2 stars due to sanitary reasons. The restaurant has an open kitchen, knowing that all customers can watch the workers make their food, this place might want to regulate on their employees. Gloves are to be worn when touching food, but not after you touch your hair, touch the pole, and wearing the same gloves touch the food that guest will be eating. I don't know about you, but I'm pretty anal when it comes to people preparing my food."}
{"text":"The chicken and ribs was delicious especially the chicken! It wasn't a long wait to receive our food so A+ for that"}
{"text":"The service was not that bad & friendly workers are always a plus! The chicken & ribs were tasty as well. The chicken wasn't undertook nor was it too burnt this goes with the ribs as well, not too burnt or undercooked!"}
{"text":"So I just wanted a salad so I stopped by here after driving by many times.... Just wasn't hungry enough for chicken or ribs... Got the chicken Caesar salad, pretty safe bet.  Well much to my dismay the romaine was wilting, some leaves were turning orange, the croutons chewy, chicken dry, even tried to dip in BBQ sauce and hot sauce, no help.  In their defense, it was to go order but still, if salad isn't right now I wonder about the chicken? Ribs?  I noticed on the walls they had some celebrity photos, maybe if they concentrated on the food more it may be better?  Well I can't say I been missin anything driving by all the time.... I will still try the grilled chicken, let's see how it goes......  C"}
{"text":"Adding back a star.  My last few visits have been consistently better.  I'm not sure if they cleaned house on the staff; but the food, service, and cleanliness have all been much better.  The $5 off with Yelp check-in also helps make the lunch prices much more palatable as well.  You can dine for under $10 including a drink.  Happy customer once again!"}
{"text":"Great chicken and ribs! I always ask for some extra BBQ sauce on the side to take home. It's delicious. Family says the wraps, salads, and grilled chicken are wonderful as well but I have yet to try them. Just wish they had nutritional information on their website or menus."}
{"text":"Cannot beat the $10 for $20 coupon from Yelp. Excellent food and great sides."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Amazing chicken, and very tasty, juicy, tender ribs. I loved the Mac and cheese, but the ribs were surprisingly good l! The chicken wrap was okay...my wife wasn't too crazy about it...I highly recommend the chicken though...really good."}
{"text":"This place is so horrible!   First time I ordered a wrap, there were BONES in my wrap! Everyone that I was eating with threw their wraps away.   A coworker had suggested that we get a salad from there, we ordered to go, and when we got back to the office there was no chicken on my salad! I ordered chicken on my chicken salad! WTF!  I ordered catering from their site, entered my credit card information and in less than 24 hours I got 3 fraud alert warnings and had to cancel my credit card.  I told the delivery driver and he assured me that it wasn't them, So I asked about his PCi security standards, and he had nothing to say as he is walking around with my credit card number on his order paper.   So I decided to go through a third party caterer.   I placed a catering order for one of the teams at my job, and had to cancel the order because the employees could not make it into the office due to the entire team getting in a car accident the night before. I had the third party caters call to cancel the order and they said the manager was rude and was not willing to budge on the \"cancellation fee\"  The cancellation fee was 50%. For that price why didn't you just bring the food. They said they already made the food. A garden salad, pasta salad, and assorted wraps that you sell....   The manager was very rude and did not care about the circumstances.    I should have known not to go back..... After these four instances.  I will NEVER..... EVER EVER EVER EVER go back to Nevada Chicken Cafe."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!!!! This place was clean, staff was friendly and most importantly the food was so so good and fresh! The Mac n Cheese! Oh yum!!! Chicken and ribs cooked perfectly and tender! The pico de gayo was my most favorite ever! Shredded up some chicken and made some tacos even with the provided tortillas! Enjoyed the family seating as well! Most definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Still drooling and licking my fingers...  I have been going to Nevada Chicken Cafe for over 8 years.. almost daily when I lived in the area up until 2012... I just got into Vegas on business this week.. after over 3 years away and yearning for the sensational taste of the Mesquite BBQ Chicken and Ribs.. and my \"custom side dish\" (combination of Sweet Potato and Saffron Rice)... Actually... I found the place has had a full face lift.. with major improvements to the patio, and the parking lot.. AWESOME.. As well as a revised interior seating and ordering area.. all great upgrades that provide an extremely family friendly environment from the seating to the order menus to the well uniformed and informed STAFF... i NOTICED AND REMEMBERED THAT MOST OF THE STAFF ON DUTY WERE THE SAME CREW FROM YEARS AGO!!! That alone speaks for the consistency of the restaurant performance and ownership. New cooking equipment... especially a rotisserie type BBQ for the ribs.. resulted in even MORE JUICY AND TASTY RIBS.  The chicken was well cooked and Juicy at the same time...  The custom side I love so much and have had sooooo many times in the past WAS EVEN BETTER THAN I REMEMBER IT!!! But don't believe me.. eating is believing.. ride, run or walk over TODAY AND TASTE FOR YOUR SELF... God Bless.. them with many more years of success... Spread the LOVE.. I highly recommend this place....!!!!!"}
{"text":"The wait is too much it took more than 25 min and they would skip people and give the food out to people that got there after us."}
{"text":"Love!! Quick healthy and the best grilled chicken around. Cannot gonwrong with Nevada Chicken!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time because my 8 yr old picky son told me he liked it. It's hard finding a place we both agree on!  Been here 2 times in the last 4 days and I live 30 min away!  Good food!  Fresh food!"}
{"text":"Besides Carson Kitchen, this is by far my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas, and for different reasons. The food here is prepared fresh and you can see the entire kitchen and the meat rotating over a wood fire. The flavor is outstanding and the options in sides range from healthy to not healthy (my personal favorite being the mashed potatoes and gravy and the macaroni and cheese). Get the chicken and rib combo so as to try both and you will keep coming back for more."}
{"text":"Tried the ribs with BBQ sauce, mashed potatoes, and chicken pasta salad was really good. Coleslaw was on the o.k. side. The BBQ sauce is a good one."}
{"text":"Very poor service employees complained of having to clean up . And clean the tv menus mounted above register . If you're complaining about cleaning probably means that you guys don't clean very well very turned off from this place will not be back"}
{"text":"Best chicken and ribs! Super fresh food... the sauces are great and we're never disappointed"}
{"text":"First the good...the food is really good with a nice selection of grilled goods and a solid lineup of side dishes. Seating is comfortable and a tip for newcomers is to take advantage of the outside seating located out the back of the restaurant. Very comfortable seating as well.   Now the not so good... service is on the slower side and the different cashiers I've encountered are struggling with the computer. This of course can be remedied by better training and when that happens Nevada chicken cafe will be a solid 4 star location."}
{"text":"The portions and price are great. The chicken is moist and full of flavor. I love the ribs and that you can add your own sauce. The blueberry BBQ sauce is amazing.  The fruit cups are super fresh and sweet. Lots of sides to choose from. I have not had a single bad thing yet.  The place is very clean with an open kitchen. I crave this place!"}
{"text":"I've been on yelp for awhile but never written a review before. I have seen a good amount of reviews that pretty much sum up to this placing having  issues with consistency.  All that I can say for my first time visit here earlier today I was really impressed with the food.   I ordered the Rib and Chicken Combo. Both the Ribs and Chicken were hot and fresh tasting. The Ribs melted off of the bone and was overall better than a few of the barbecue places I have eaten at. The Chicken was moist and tasted great even before trying their homemade barbecue sauce which was delicious as well.  I plan on eating there again tomorrow and will post an update if I experience an issue with consistency. I truly hope it is as good tomorrow as it was today.   For now... Thumbs up for me..."}
{"text":"Like the chain but not this location. Ordered for delivery and was called by the restaurant that they were out of pulled pork, ok, so I got chicken sandwich instead with no coleslaw on top and a side of mashed potatoes. When my order was delivered I received a chicken sandwich with a side of coleslaw (if I don't want it on my sandwich, I don't want it anywhere--not a fan) and no mashed potatoes, very disappointing. I got a random side of potato salad in the bag-- YUCK! I did not order this, would have loved to have the hot mashed potatoes I ordered. I called and just got put on hold for 22 minutes ... I will not go back to this location, but I will go to the Arroyo Crossing location."}
{"text":"The new location at Fort Apache and Tropicana is amazing! I pulled into the parking lot and I could already smell the deliciousness awaiting me. I walked in and saw all the employees even the owner Nico and Ladan taking orders to the tables making the fresh slaw! Ordering is easy, fast and friendly. I ordered their half ribs and chicken breast with chicken wings and their roasted potatoes very reasonably priced. The food was brought to me on real dinnet plates beautiful presentation of the food. Then taking a bite Pure Heaven! I highly recommend this restaurant the flavors are amazing the service is impeccable and the prices are Beyond reasonable."}
{"text":"Love this place but I don't understand how they are always out of pico de gallo !!!! I think they just do not want to keep cleaning up after it SMH !!"}
{"text":"The ribs are really juicy and don't even need BBQ sauce, but their BBQ is really good if you do use it! The chicken is amazing and the wraps are really good, all fresh ingredients and huge portions. I came for the chicken but really, really like the ribs!"}
{"text":"Best chicken I've ever had not greasy at all cooked perfectly spices we're awesome not to mention the variety of side dishes you can have I tried the broccoli and pasta reminded me of my italian pasta salad yummy... Fresh and  many many levels above other chicken places this is not a fast food chicken place although you do receive your order very fast lots of goodies to go with your order. I was served by the owner Nico he was very nice and very articulate when it came to making sure that the way the items were served was artistically set in a certain way. I was starving I have no problem eating the entire meal down... they definitely have a different better product to offer than other chicken places did I mention they had ribs too? the ribs were awesome.. I will be back for more I would definitely love to fit them into a weekly meal if I passed by the one of the locations you can guarantee it thanks for the quick awesome service and the fabulous food Trish Kerr ATI"}

{"text":"I didn't know what I was going to get ordering here, never had it, no one ordering had. It was close to work, they delivered through Grubhub and had salads, done. We all were so pleasantly surprised. I had a Waldorf salad, my coworkers had chicken avocado wraps and pulled pork sandwiches. All were fantastic! Two of my coworkers said \"we found our go-to\". The salad was huge, fresh and well made. The pulled pork had fresh, homemade coleslaw, a big hit with my coworker. Keep it up, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for places that use the power of smell to get customers attention.  I wasn't even hungry but the smokey bbq chicken aroma made me stop by for a quick snack.  In comparison to a more well known establishment, a quick snack to me would be El Pollo Loco's 2 item (breast/wing) combo with rice and sweet corncake with two tacos el carbon.  So naturally when I came I got the 3 piece dark which came with 2 legs, a thigh piece, and two sides (rice, and mixed veggies).    For some reason the chicken tasted dehyrdated.  Like they were made with the intent of it being completely well done and then sat around while you prepared another dish.  The rice was plain and good, and the salad was about the size that Las Vegas Grille serves, good to-go box size full.    I should have tried the 1/4 rib combo that came with a breast and wing, 1 side, and drink but I'll save that for next time."}
{"text":"This is by far the best ribs and chicken i ever had. extremely clean restaurant.  hot and  fresh food, fast service.friendly people  this is the 3rd location they opened about 3 months ago I wish they had more . I defiantly recommend .  Good Job guys and thank you."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, clean as a whistle but HORRIBLE MUSIC. I DO NOT WANT TO LISTEN TO HIP HOP MUSIC while eating my chicken. Seems like a little thing but I think the owners, while trying to appeal to the young demographics, have forgotten about the rest of us and should play a more varied play list. Frankly, I was annoyed and I hope they make the adjustment soon. Not going back, no matter how good the food is! Keep the sports TV, 88 the Hip Hop music!!!"}
{"text":"All I seem to eat daily is chicken, chicken, and more chicken.  Maybe I'm over-exaggerating, but at least 3 of my meals each day involve chicken.  That being said, I should know what a good tasting chicken taste like.  I should know what a cooked chicken taste like.  When Nevada Chicken Cafe opened, I immediately bookmarked it because of their selection and prices.  I was here about a week after they opened and was treated with great service, a clean restaurant, and again, good prices.  For about $10, I got their half roasted chicken with a side of their sweet potatoes.  First of all, their sweet potatoes are phenomenal.  I would come back just for this.  Then there was the chicken. Again, I got the half chicken which consists of a breast, wing, leg, and a thigh.  The leg and thigh was good and full of flavor. I was almost an instant huge fan of the Nevada Chicken Cafe and let me stress...ALMOST.  It was all downhill once I got to their breast and wing.  Both looked cooked on the outside, but raw on the inside.  I understand, maybe it's an adjustment period for them. But since they specialize in chicken, they should at least get the cooking right.  I ate the pieces that were edible (i.e. not red or bloody).  I didn't complain or bring my dish back.  I figure that they'll improve and I hope they do.  Their chicken dropped my rating. Overall, I am just giving them 3 stars for the service, their menu selection, the prices, and their sweet potatoes.   PS:  The ribs looked good.  They at least looked cooked."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place in order to fill the giant void left in my life after I left LA 4 years ago, and being forced to also leave Chicken Dijon (http://www.chickendijon.com/). Being (sorta) new in town, I am still looking for \"regular\" lunch places for takeout that are delicious but won't make my ass huge.   Unfortunately, Nevada Chicken Cafe doesn't hold a candle to Chicken Dijon. I ordered the chicken cesaer wrap, and the meat was pretty dry and it kind of grossed me out. The whole thing fell apart the second I took it out on my desk so I ate it with a fork-- not very wrap-esque. The tortilla was fresh though, and bonus points for having light dressings for the wraps and salads. Sadly I may not go back, since Subway is just as close."}
{"text":"Great healthy food!  Very fast and friendly service.  The chicken is grilled on a bbq and is outstanding!"}
{"text":"The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars in my book is the new change to their chicken pasta. Don't mess with the classics man..The chicken is great and I love their sides. I would suggest the sweet potatoes or pesto pasta.  Building your own salad  is also a great! The salsa bar is also awesome and I am addicted to their ranch. They have also added juices and smoothies."}
{"text":"The food is good. Loved the chicken and mozzarella salad, it was actually perfect. Same with the sweet potatoes.  Here is the problem. I ordered online for delivery, however after I hit order, it doesn't give you a confirmation or anything just takes you back to the home screen. So I thought it didn't go through. Same thing. So I let it be and assumed I wasn't eating there today. Sure enough the delivery guy, who was completely monotone and I'm pretty sure high out of his mind, walks in with not one.. But the two orders that I never got a confirmation for. So now I have 40 dollars worth of 2 of the exact same meals delivered to me, when there should only be one.   I really enjoyed the food even though half of it will be tossed and was a complete waste due to a crappy online system. I'll eat here again but will go pick it up myself so I'm not screwed out of 25 dollars."}
{"text":"Chicken was eh!! It used to be a lot better. Service was good but the food wasn't. Consistency is tough"}
{"text":"The food here is very good but tonight upon arrival shortly before closing  the counter staff were not their happy go lucky selves and the tables and floors were filthy. Normally would have been a four or five star rating. Will be back but not as quickly as before."}
{"text":"Terrible service and an overpriced menu.  You have 15 people behind the counter, no one in front of me, but 20 minutes for my order.  Terribly run place."}
{"text":"Don't go here around 3pm. They only have one cash drawer and you have to wait and watch the poor cashier count the drawer out at the cash register. Never ever saw this at any restaurant. On to the food! Thursday's special is a half rack of baby back ribs, a side, and a drink for $12.99. I love the rub they used, and the meat was tender. I got the coleslaw for the side mnf enjoyed that, too. I will go again, as I enjoy their food, but will be avoiding the 3 o'clock hour"}
{"text":"Chicken was so good, and the mash potatoes is fantastic! So that we came back here again after trying it yesterday for the very first time!!"}
{"text":"I love a good rib so I got a half stack of baby back ribs.  The ribs were big and looked good, but they didn't have that smell or tenderness a good rib should have.  It was okay after I put some BBQ sauce on it, but nothing to write home about.  I also had a side of Mac N Cheese, but as Heather S. pointed out in her review, very bland.  So I mixed in some BBQ sauce and it was much better.  My friend got the pulled pork sandwich but it looked like a strange sub in a tightly wrapped paper.  It contained onions which was not disclosed to her when she ordered so she had to spend most or her time picking them out of the tight sub.  Overall, this place does not impress."}
{"text":"my favorite bar-be-que . place of all time and i have ate and lived in a lot of places in the U.S.A . lucky for me i live right across the street from these delicious place. we  order our favorite ribs once a week summer and winter. Keep up the good work Nevada Chicken Cafe. Everything on the menu is REALLY REALLY GOOOOOOD!!!."}
{"text":"I found this gem of a place thanks to a foodie buddy of mine. I've been here about 7 times in the past 2 months and I'm totally digging it.  Not only is the chicken smoky awesome but the vegetable chicken soup is the best in town. I've also had their ribs and their pretty good along with all the large variety of tasty sides they offer... my fave is the orange colored rice.  Another thing this chicken joint has going for it is the price. You get 2 meals + 1 drink for $16 tax included and you also get to enjoy great customer service that's provided every time your here and the cleanliness of the place."}
{"text":"If you want good grilled or rotisserie chicken with a big array of sides this is the place.  I recommend the half chicken with roasted potatoes or saffron rice or broccoli pasta salad.  FYI its closed on Sunday which sucks!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to have lunch. Chose to try the chicken avocado wrap with a side of fruit salad. Sat down and when the food arrived the first thing I noticed was how large the wrap was.  The chicken was moist and flavorful and the rest of the veggies inside the wrap blended perfectly with just enough dressing. The only problem I had was fitting it in my mouth to get a bite.  Will be coming back to try the other menu items."}
{"text":"Went to grab dinner and bring it home. Got home before realizing they didn't give us one of our sides.  The chicken is good and juicy, but really salty. The wraps are very dry, but decent. The mac & cheese is not good at all. I didn't try the ribs, but they smelled delicious.   Overall, with all the other delicious food in this area, I don't foresee coming back. However, if someone bought me food from here, I'd still eat it."}
{"text":"The food is great, the Mac and cheese, ribs, and mashed potatoes are all delish! The location off Rainbow was hotter than balls inside!!! We asked three times for someone to turn down the air and no one ever did. When I walked to the restroom I saw the inside temp was 90 degrees on the thermostat. Everyone  in the restaurant was sweating and fanning themselves. As a customer you expect a good eating atmosphere and part of that dining experience is a comfortable temperature."}
{"text":"The person waiting on us was busy putting bags of food together to take r order. People when people r there during lunch time they only have so much time. Let someone else out the food in bags for take out and delivery. The food came pretty quick and it was good. The size of max and cheese seems small but it is not and the chicken sandwich and pulled pork sandwich was pretty big I only ate half my sandwich.  We were there at 11:30 not to bad only one group in front of us other then having to wait for the person to wait on us, its fine I'll get over it. The food was good and the place was clean."}
{"text":"Honestly I would really only go here for the chicken...  Being my first time here I could care less about getting amazing customer service..   But as far as the food.    Everything tastes like it's out of a can...  Sides, sauces..    I ordered the 1/4 chicken, rib combo.   Chicken was good. Ribs were literally so tuff I could Barely get the meat off of the bone... Idk maybe I got a bad batch..   I just don't see all the hype..   Oh yeah the mash potatoes were pretty fam good.... Chicken the potatoes are on point I would say..   Beans. Tastes like bushes baked beans out of a can.. And all the sauces tastes like they get them from mcdonalds or where ever mcdonalds get there sauces from. Lol.     Maybe it was the chef that was working. But maybe my sec visit will be better.."}
{"text":"Chicken had good flavor. Sides were descent. I've been hearing about Nevada Chicken Cafe for quite a while now and how good it is, but it wasn't until they opened this location that I actually ended up trying it. Like I said already the flavor is there. The only drawback was that they didn't have white meat (30 min wait)."}
{"text":"The ribs and chicken are really flavorful.  Sides are ok."}
{"text":"I've been to both locations multiple times. This one is loads better. I always get the house special salad. It is HUGE, fresh, and hard to eat all of it in one sitting. The ingredients here always are fresher than the other location. I think its because they are busier.   My husband and I will get the chicken and its always been good. Its hit or miss with the sides.   Recommend!"}
{"text":"Well I've been to this place a bunch of times now. I don't think I've had a bad meal. Ribs are awesome, chicken is awesome, and the bbq sauce is awesome. Always good service. Maybe only thing I would say I wish the combos came with 2 sides instead of one? But that's being really nitpicky. Will keep coming back."}
{"text":"We love the food and service our family love the mesquite charcoal taste O the sauce is excellent. Make sure you eat here.no bull I do everyday I.g.rich Rico o.f.t.e.n.' Hi)"}
{"text":"Love the services Tavis is the greatest. Good food looks right taste right I need more Nevada chicken Cafe we eat here everyday."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic and the service was fast! Definitely my new favorite lunch spot!"}
{"text":"My favorite food is chicken so I had to try out this place. I got the BBQ Wings with Mashed Potatoes. It was a little bit hard to eat. I think it was overcooked and dry but the smokey flavor was there. My husband got the 1/2 Rack Ribs with mashed potatoes. It was good and enjoyable to eat. I'll have to try that next time."}
{"text":"Saw owner opening walmart chocolate chip cookies, and then repackaging them as their cookies, yuck! When they opened their first store it was great, but over the years the flavors have changed and the chicken is bone dry. Any grocery store rotisserre chicken is better. Ordered 1/2 rack ofribs  for $13.49 , they gave me 4 ratty looking ribs. Mashed potatoes are so bland. Gave this new store a chance but, not going back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The manager I believe his name was Mike, made sure our first time there was an excellent one. Staff is very friendly and the food is amazing! The chicken and ribs are delicious and the SWEET POTATO!"}
{"text":"Had this food catered at a bday party - even after two hours (I was late) it was good.  I'm very picky about sauces, but I at 6 ribs with no sauce - and the flavor was good.  Not cold, not warm, just the right ambient room temperature.  I didn't have room for the chicken, but all were raving.   So, ribs after two hours on a buffet candle were good, I would expect fresh served ribs to be a topper."}
{"text":"My daughter and I were headed to the Chipotle and decided to try Nevada Chicken that is next door and we were glad  we did . I had the 1/2 chicken with two sides . Mashed potato sand a garden salad . My daughter had the pulled pork sandwich with mashed potatoes. Everything was delicious. We will come back ."}
{"text":"Everything is SO delicious here!! The chicken is the best! We used the deal available on yelp but even without it you get good portions for what you pay and it's actually good food, not some mystery meat from a fast food place. The staff has always been friendly when I'm there, and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good fresh food at great price, the rotisserie chicken falls of the bones and the ribs are tender.   The sides are good  but that's not what I go there for.  Nice family atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ordered through grubhub... ribs, mashed potatoes w/gravy, sweet potatoes, chicken pasta and Caesar salad,  everything was absolutely delicious, we ordered potato salad as well but that was left out of the order, called to ask about it but never got an answer... they made up for it though (not sure if it was intentional or not) with all the extra bones they included AND everything was still warm once it was delivered. I would def recommend them.."}
{"text":"His place isn't too bad! I actually liked it. Great side items and the chicken comes two ways. Rotisserie or grilled.  I liked that. The ambiance of the place is cool too.   Can't go wrong ordering the 1/2 chicken. The meat slides right off the bones and it's very tasty."}
{"text":"Called in order and receieved timely service. Ordered a whole rack of ribs and 3 pieces were pink and undercooked. Maybe the end of the rack was hanging off the end of the grill where it was not hot enough. Mac n cheese was a little watery and underseasoned in my opinion. My bf thought it was good."}
{"text":"I got a combo meal of 1/4 rack ribs, breast, wing + a side and a drink. I thought the portion was decent. However, it is a little bit more pricier than anticipated. I would come back because of the good service and courteous staff."}
{"text":"If you've driven by Sahara & Jones, you must have smelled the unmistakable roasted chicken or seen the smoke out of this café's outdoor grill. I finally decided it was time to try it. The chicken was tender and tasty, the sides however very average. Overall, it was an ok experience."}
{"text":"Ok so I decided to try them again because they showed up on restaurant.com with a $25 off if I spent $50. This time I decided to eat out and only rate the food versus the entire establishment.    Ordered 2 full rack of ribs with the sauce on the side. It was delicious and had plenty of left overs.  The rice and potatoes? were plentiful? along with the Mac and cheese.  Would recommend to all to try again, but call it in to avoid the long wait time. Just realized it has been 4 years since my last review of them-yikes"}
{"text":"Just went there for lunch.  The chicken was pretty good. I like the baked beans, potato salad was ok as well.  I like that they bbq the food outside.  It feels like I just went to a bbq for lunch.  Coupon for 2nd meal at 8 dollars off was awesome.  I will go back at regular price as I hear the ribs are good too."}
{"text":"I've had this spot bookmarked for awhile, but it took finding them on UberEats to get me to finally give it a try. My order made for a decent lunch.  In looking at the menu I was impressed with both the selection and the prices. I assumed Nevada Chicken Café was rotisserie chicken and sides, but they offer much more. They offer BBQ ribs, salads, and wraps. The list of sides offered a nice variety of hot and cold options. There are meal options for larger orders too.  I went with a 1/4 Chicken that said it would come with a warm tortilla and salsa along with one side. I went with macaroni and cheese as my side. I was given the option of rotisserie, mesquite charcoal, or a mix for the chicken. I opted for the mix of the two. I really enjoyed the chicken. It was moist, had good flavor, and the skin was tasty. I really liked the BBQ sauce that came with the chicken. The tortilla was fine and went well with the chicken. My salsa was absent. The macaroni and cheese was bland. It wasn't bad, but I wouldn't order it again.  Overall, a decent meal option and reasonably priced for what you get. I'd give this place another try."}
{"text":"Good barbecue, reasonably priced, staff is friendly. All the side dishes and made fresh daily and you can taste it."}
{"text":"We like eating here. Love the mac n cheese. Beans are good too. But disappointed today when we came in. Six other people are working. One cashier. Cashier on the phone taking order. It was a very long conversation. My husband asked a worker if anybody else can cashier. She said no. We waited for ten minutes and we just left. The girl on the phone didn't even acknowledge us. There are usually at least two cashiers, but this time, there was only one."}
{"text":"Chicken was good , potato salad was bomb , mac and cheese and mashed potato were way to salty."}
{"text":"First time here and I've seen it for years.  Wtf was wrong with me?   I had some of the tastiest mashed potatoes and gravy, mac and cheese,  and pulled pork,  like EVER. Hubby got a rack of ribs and he loved it. My son drooled like mad over his bbq wings.   Daughter was,  \"like a munching machine and ate a lot of food\".  Now,  the price,  I guess,  you get what you pay for,  because this food is smoking and the prices and a little bit higher than i was expecting. That being said,  I'll probably be back with my bib on."}
{"text":"Used the Yelp 10 for 20 deal. For that, I was able to get a 3-piece dark meat with 2 sides, and 1/4 white meat with 2 sides. First, the chicken was dry, specially the chicken breast. My friend had difficulties cutting into the breast, although we were using plastic utensils, but still... it's not like we're cutting into a piece of bone. Next the sides. We got mixed fruits, corn, mac n cheese, and caesar salad. The corn was straight from the can, they only added step was to warm it up. The mac n cheese was ok - tasted like it was made from the box. Two good things about this place, good serving size and garlic ranch. Thank goodness I bought the yelp deal, I would have totally regretted it if I paid for the food full price. I don't think I'll ever go back."}
{"text":"This place is good but the ppl taking the order don't care, are new or don't pay attention when the customer is placing the order. I asked my chicken and ribs with BBQ sauce on it and if I don't check would have gone home and the order was not prepared properly. When I asked for the order to be fixed, the kitchen workers turned around looked at me with an attitude, like bothered because I asked to be fixed. Advise to always check your order before walking out.   Poor attitude, poor customer service!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and I like the convenience of it being so close to my work. But to be truthful; call your order in for any to-go's as wait times are longer than I had expected my first time. My call in order was awesome!! Ready right when I walked in and all the accoutrement to boot. Good food, friendly staff but for less money I might also consider El pollo loco the other direction. A tip for owners/management would be to maybe add a coupon deal like $5.00 off a $15.00 deal as I noticed a lot of individual diners or maybe discount for nearby employees of neighboring retailers i.e.; Home Depot."}
{"text":"Great food. The chicken was great and so were the sides (we got mashed potatoes, corn, and . The girl who worked at the counter was extremely patient and nice as my boyfriend and I asked questions about the menu.   Overall really good food for the price. We got plenty to eat for $20 worth (we used a coupon)."}
{"text":"Nevada Chicken Café catered my companys Christmas Party and man did they bring a TON of food.  They do Chicken-rotissere-grilled chicken-a little dry compared to El Pollo Loco but good non the less.  They also had ribs which were VERY tough & dry.  Definitely would NOT do the ribs again.  The side were a little bland & boring-mac-n-cheese,some orange looking rice and salads.  They have great prices so it may be worth checking out again when its NOT catered but made to order."}
{"text":"Good ribs good chicken. Bbq sauce is bomb. Chicken avacado wrap is also very good. Don't like the fact that there potatoes are instant. And Mac and cheese is dry. They also give you a flour tortilla with chicken n rib orders. I don't get it? Wish they would give us rolls or biscuits instead. Other than that. Really good and people that work here are friendly and helpful. Good prices.  Will come come back."}
{"text":"This is one place in Vegas that's does ribs and chicken right! Ribs are delicious no matter what kind you get. They are quick and they also deliver....This is making me homesick for Las Vegas..."}
{"text":"This place was a pleasant surprise. I walked in not knowing at all what I was getting myself into. It was clean, well lit, and everyone was very friendly. I ordered the Farm salad and was impressed by all the fresh ingredients. Fresh cut mozzarella, fresh beets, basil, parsley, tomatoes, and of course chicken.  They are located right between Panera and Panda Express and I assume most people overlook it and visit the more well known establishments instead. I encourage anyone who is on this side of town to give it a try and experience something a bit different. I know I'll be back."}
{"text":"The reason i tried Nevada chicken café is because of the deal they have in the entertainment book. the place serves good chicken. they grilled the food outside and smell is just so salivating. good marketing skills i must say. the fact that the food is grilled, gives u a sense of lesser guilt so u may eat more. u should applaud urself for eating something that's not fried. the saffron rice was really not that good. i was a bit disappointed that it doesn't taste anything like a saffron rice, it taste like food coloring to me.   the place is just not located strategically for a food place. its right next to the gas station and it doesn't really look so clean."}
{"text":"I love he chicken soup here!  Loaded with chunks of chicken and fresh vegetables.  I load up on sides duchess fruit salad, cucumber salad and mashed potatoes.   Skip the potatoes and you have a very satisfying low calorie/carb meal."}
{"text":"The aroma from their outside barbecue led us here but I found out it wasn't all it was cracked up to be. I ordered a Chicken Avocado Sandwich and the Chicken Pasta on the side recommended by the cashier. I usually like trying something new so I like asking the workers what they think is good...bad move on my part. When I picked up the sandwich it fell apart... but the parts that I did eat were decent. The Chicken Pasta was Pink! I love that color and I'm not picky so I tried it. It was sweet and sour and I maybe found one tiny piece of chicken in it. I couldn't eat a third bite and my husband couldn't stomach a second bite. I left it alone and sipped on my sugar free Watermelon Juice. I liked that they have sugar free options but I didn't like that they didn't put ice in my drink especially when it's so hot outside! My husband had the Chicken Caesar Wrap and a side of salad. I tried the wrap and that tasted fresh and the salad was also good. The salad was big for being a side item. The food was okay but it's nothing I would  crave for."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place again since were not too shabby last time. This time around I had the ribs and chicken combo. The ribs were meaty and well seasoned but a little dry, I'm thinking cause it comes off the grill and into a pan waiting for customers. The chicken this time was better nice and hot, juicy and the smokey flavor was good. I'm not sure why I don't come here more often but I should. Its not bad for the money."}
{"text":"We originally planned to have dinner at another place across the street from them.  I saw their van parked in the lot a couple blocks down and decided to try it.  We walked in and was impressed how it looked very clean.  We looked at the menu for a few.  They have ribs, wraps and salads too!!  I ordered the rib chicken combo and the wife had the Asian salad.  The chicken was \"ok\" but the ribs were very good.  The wife loved her salad!  We decided we would be back.  Next it will be the chicken Caesar salad!  Tip:  show the $5.00 off coupon before ordering or save it till next time!!!"}
{"text":"Great take out place for dinner for the family. They have a really good family pack that feeds 6,  it is two full chickens, three large hot or cold sides, a large salad, and 6 tortillas for $42.75. The chicken is really flavorful and juicy, the pieces are cut nicely, I love that they cut the breast piece in half so that it is a better size for serving. The side dishes are really really good. I love the mashed potatoes and gravy! The black beans are also another one of my favorites. My kids love their mac and cheese, and the Caesar Salad is pretty good too. They have delivery and are on Uber Eats which is great for me for a busy weeknight, and a little healthier dinner for the kids than the typical take out."}
{"text":"Love the bbq chicken, mashed potatoes w/gravy, and caesars salad!! A most fabulous lunch!!!"}
{"text":"I got the BBQ chicken sandwich, parents got the ribs plate and wrap. Everything was amazing. That mac and cheese though  delicious."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. The food here is soooo good. The ribs are REALLY ribs guys. Not like some fake little pieces of meat on a twig. Real ribs. And they put a dry rub on it while it cooks, turning it into this delicious, semi crunchy bark. Smother it in some barbecue sauce and it's probably the best thing you'll find in this town. The sweet potatoes are delicious and my absolute favorite part! Just trrryyy it! You'll like it!!!!"}
{"text":"Meats are seasoned well, flavorful and juicy. Plenty of healthy sides along with classic comfort sides too. I tend to pile on pico with cucumber found in the condiment station. Definitely a fresher alternative to standard fast food and corporate restaurants."}
{"text":"Experience: I have always wanted to try this place as every time I drive up and down Sahara, I see the grill a smokin.  We were in the area, and I found a coupon in my \"Entertainment\" book. Yes!  It was about 4pm and we were going for a very late lunch/early dinner.   Facility: it's pretty small, only about 5 booths and 5 tables. It was cool you can see where they prepare the chicken and ribs through the window. It's got a fast food feel, but with better food.   Service: You order your food at the counter and the give you a number. They bring it to your table. The guy that helped us was friendly and answered all our questions. However, we stood at the counter a few minutes waiting for him to finish mopping.   Food:  I got the combo with dark meat chicken, ribs, and 1 side for $11.99. The CHICKEN (3.5/5) was good. It had a nice mesquite flavor and the meat was moist. Felt like it was missing something though. I pulled it off, wrapped it in the tortilla, added salsa, pico and some SALAD (4/5) off my plate. I liked that. I loved the PICO (5/5) because it was tart and it had cucumber in it. The SALSA (3/5) was good and spicy.  RIBS (4/5) were good. Again, loved the mesquite flavor. I added the BBQ SAUCE (2.5/5), and not a huge fan. It was just too sweet for me. They need a second sauce that is savory and spicy. I ordered the POTATO SALAD (3/5) that wasn't bad, but not a fan of the onions in it. I got an extra side of MACARONI AND CHEESE (3/5) which was also decent, but needs some salt.   Overall: (3/5) I liked it, but didn't LOVE it. I would come back, but not waiting in a long line. I liked the meat, but the sides were just ok. To me, the best BBQ is good meat and good sides too!!!!  So, this was just ok."}
{"text":"The chicken and ribs are awesome, fresh salad all the sides are great, fast and good service.  Great value, five stars for Nevada Chicken"}
{"text":"I'm trying to eat clean again, so this place gives me some good options. The roasted chicken was tender and not dried out at all. The steamed veggies........were steamed veggies. I ate them because they are good for me. I'll probably be back again when I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Recently visited this restaurant on a Saturday afternoon and was not disappointed. The variety of options was great and I enjoyed the healthy choices such as fruit salad, side salads, and veggies. I ordered the chicken wrap while my guest had the half rack of ribs. The food tasted fresh and delicious and there was even signature sauces available for the taking. Definitely recommend this place to other chicken lovers!"}
{"text":"Veery good spot! I was getting my car serviced down the street and was searching Yelp for a spot to eat when it was done. I came across this place and glad we did! Good was delicious!!! Everything was seasoned well and all the sides in the window looked fresh! Wish there was one close to my house"}
{"text":"Just left this place and i must say i was very pleased. Was greeted as soon as i walked in. The cashier explained to me the meals and favorites which is always a plus and my food was out pretty fast. I ate in to get the full expierence. My coworkers kept telling me to go, but was hesitant until a co-worker said the macaroni and cheese is really good so i ordered wings and mac and cheese along with a fountain drink and roll which i could have chosen tortilla instead so i like that option. The wings were great. It wasn't that down home southern wing, but the flavor was there and the meat came off the bone so easy which for me is a plus. Great taste. Be sure to get extra napkins for the sauce from the wings which is not on the tables, but by the fountain drinks. The mac and cheese was ok. A more suburban taste than southern, but hey it complimented the meal a little. Now the other thing that drew me there was the fact that they offer a discount to the company i work for and that's what got me in. More businesses should take notes from this because it took 1 employee of 120 to say something and even while i was there i saw a coworker who went just because that employee was happy with the food and service. I would definitely go back. Without the discount it is a bit pricey, hence my 4 rating, but it makes up for it with the chicken. Will not order the mac and cheese again, but im open to try other stuff given what the cashier had told me. So I'll be back when the budget permits. Was a little confused with the music going and the t.v. on silent so i had to lip read while listening to the overhead music which wasn't bad. Comforatable setting and the attitude of the employees were great."}
{"text":"I feel very compelled to give this place a review for 2 reasons. 1- the chicken is amazing. 2- this place somehow only has a 3 star total.  I only ordered their mesquite chicken, but I have to say it was pretty amazing. I will never be able to spend 10 bucks at KFC or Pollo Loco knowing this place exists. The service was fast, the food was amazing, and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Second time trying Nevada Chicken Cafe. We ordered a 1/4 rack ribs (which is only 3 bones) for $6.99 with a side, 1/2 chicken for $7.75 with a side, a chicken avocado wrap with garlic dressing for $9.95 with a side, and BBQ chicken sandwich for $8.50 which also comes with a side.    Last time we ordered the BBQ chicken sandwich the coleslaw came on the side, so we were expecting the same this time but sadly it was put on the sandwich, which the person who it was for was not too happy about.   I had asked for extra dressing on the side for my wrap only to find out when we got the food back to work it was not included. Which was a bummer because the wrap itself was actually quite dry and the avocado was not ripe enough. The side of macaroni and cheese was just mediocre at best.   The ribs are really tasty, but a little bit on the pricey side, and honestly the only thing I thing that really shined were their mashed potatoes, they were delicious!    If we visit a third time, I'll stick to their sandwiches with extra meat because they don't have a lot on their giant buns."}
{"text":"Came in around day two of when they opened. The restaurant was clean, well stocked, and everyone was all smiles. This was my first time at any of the Nevada Chicken Cafe locations and so I was a little confused by the menu. The employees guided us through all of the combos and made us feel very welcomed. The whole restaurant smelled amazing, it really riled up our taste buds.   We sat at a booth and the food came quickly and on real plates! We each got the chicken and ribs with sides. I got mac and cheese with a tortilla and my partner got roasted potatoes with a dinner roll. I'm always hesitant with mac and cheese from these casual quick serve type establishments because they aren't the quality I'm looking for. However, I was having a craving and took the risk. And boy, was I glad I did. Their mac and cheese was really tasty and flavorful. You can tell taste the cheese and it didn't look like it was sitting around for hours. The chicken and ribs were solid. I'm not a huge on ribs, but they were tender and full of meat.  All in all, would visit again for the bbq craving - it was a great first time experience."}
{"text":"You can smell the BBQ a mile away, love it!  Excellent food, great service (thank you Amir) and finally a location close to me!  If you haven't been, go quickly!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant, it was definitely something different to try which was very nice. I've seen the BBQ going many times before while driving by but I just never stopped before. I arrived at probably the worst time, lunch. They handle the crowd really well but unfortunately they were out of ribs at the moment. No complaints from me however, they said it would be a 15-20 minute wait for more which was not a problem since I wasn't on a set time limit and the manager was very nice and gave us free salads for waiting. The salads are very fresh and I like the open kitchen. The atmosphere was very quaint and I really enjyed hte outdoor seating. I wish the outdoor seating would have been a little cleaner but I'll give them this one since this time of year is pretty unpredictable. When we got our ribs, they were perfect, a nice chew not overdone but not falling apart. I liked how they had a self-serve condiment stand which everything was made fresh; garlic ranch, hot sauce, bbq sauce. The mac and cheese was awesome, I love gooey mac and cheese and the combination of cheese they use was great. I don't advise the Spinach Feta Pasta though, it was pretty bland but anything can be great with ranch or hot sauce. I'll definitely be going back and recommending to my friends as a nice alternative, something different to try. Oh yeah, and they deliver, do carry-out and catering. Don't forget to grab a punch card."}
{"text":"Not sure if they have a new owner or I just hit a bad day. I use to love this place and its been a whole since I have been there.   Yesterday, the portions of chicken and the rice were very very small. The chicken has lost a lot of its flavor as well. The rice was a bit soft and not as flavorful as I remember.  Although the service was good and the place was clean, I am not sure I would return."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my meal here, but there were some minor missteps. Three stars is slightly too low, so I'll be generous and bump it up to four stars.  I ordered the combo with 1/4 rack (3 bones) of baby back ribs, chicken leg/thigh, side of mac & cheese, and fountain drink. At $11.99, that seemed like a good deal. I got my number, sat down, and the food came out pretty quickly. I liked that it came with a small side salad and tortilla. Those were welcome surprises. The ribs were tender, but not fall off the bone tender. I liked the seasoning, though one bone was over seasoned and salty. The chicken was juicy for the most part, but some bites were bordering on slightly overcooked. For a place called Nevada Chicken Cafe, you'd think every bite would be mouth watering juicy, but it wasn't. The mac & cheese was average and the pasta was cooked past al dente. I prefer al dente, but it wasn't mushy, so I was fine with it.  At the end of the meal, I was fairly full. I thought the ribs were a bit small, but for the price, the portion size was good and my stomach was satisfied. I don't love this place, but I like it enough to return again."}
{"text":"Very clean stuff very nice.  Loved the salad.  The spices was just right. I recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"The food was just so so. The ribs were tough, the chicken was a little dry. Maybe I just caught them on a bad day. I may gp try them again, but probably not for a while."}
{"text":"First let me start with this. ..This little hidden gem is an amazing barbecue experience . The ribs are so soft and delightful, the chicken always pleases, and the mac and cheese. ..Oh My.  It is awesome.  The staff are always very pleasant whenever I come in and the atmosphere is always clean."}
{"text":"Awesome place, love the food! It is just what we need after a day of hard scuba diving and the macaroni and cheese is the bomb!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan! The chicken was excellent and the ribs are meaty and perfectly rubbed. I also had the salad Waldorph I think, and the greens were fresh and crisp. Lots of chicken atop and amazing toppings."}
{"text":"I ordered via Grubhub and I am so delighted with NCC. My food took nearly 2 hours for delivery which is really attributed to Grubhub, but I admit it was worth the wait. I ordered chicken both rotisserie and mesquite as well as ribs and everything was delicious. The flavorful chicken skin and the succulent taste down to the bones have made me a fan!"}
{"text":"After several visits, I can confirm this is a consistently good restaurant and worth a visit.   Pricing a little weird on sides,  one side $2.50, two $4.00, three $6.50? Odd progression.   Sides are large. Chicken and Ribs are well seasoned,  not too much or little,  and BBQ or hot sauce is available.  Sweet Potatoes are awesome!"}
{"text":"This is a mixed review. (It would be fewer stars if solely based on my meal. Visited 11:30 for lunch on a Thursday.  Ordered the white meat chicken combo with ribs, $12.95. Friendly service with 5 stars for plate presentation. Came with one side, drink and house salad.  Salad and side were great. Ribs and chicken looked great and the seasoning on the ribs and chicken is the only reason I may give this place a second chance.  The ribs and the chicken (breast & wing) were overcooked which equals dry.  I has hoping by coming early I would not experience overcooked food because it was sitting to long.  Again great taste due to the seasoning but someone needs some coaching in the kitchen on how to use a meat thermometer.   Will update my review when I give them a second chance."}
{"text":"I read a lot of reviews complaining about how dry or cold the chicken was... I've been here a couple of times (ordering take-out) and it has been juicy, flavorful, and warm each time.  I'm not a huge fan of their sides, to be honest, but the chicken is delicious so I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Amir is the best manager ever. He always has my chicken ready and waiting since my husband meal preps. We buy in bulk every week and his meals are delicious. I won't buy  chicken anywhere else. Don't go to any other branch. The people here are amazinggggggggggg."}
{"text":"This place is BOMB. I was recently out in Las Vegas and was tired of food establishments on the Strip so started looking for other places to eat at.  I had the 3 piece dark mesquite with cucumber salad and saffron rice. The chicken was some of the best I have ever had. Moist, juicy and flavorful. I was slightly disappointed in the rice. It tasted like plain buttered white rice to me. The cucumber salad was delicious as well. Fresh and had the right amount of tang and sweetness to it. I would definitely recommend this anyone visiting or not."}
{"text":"The food is good if you can get past seeing the small roaches running across the floor. I just find it hard to down my meal with small sewer roaches running across the floor. The first time I went there it was take out, so I did not notice the roaches. The second time I ate there after purchasing the yelp coupon. It was then that I noticed the place has small roach problem. Yuck........"}
{"text":"I always want to like this place, but usually end up disappointed. The staff is woefully unaware and are unempathetic towards food allergen needs.  Several occasions I expressed gluten and soy intolerances, abd yet both seem to end up on my plate. Everyone acts inconvenienced when asked questions.  The language barrier can be a challenge when trying to order food from some.   Customer service sucks. Food also isn't as well prepared as it used to be. The fruit smoothies are a nice touch, but otherwise, a poor experience for anyone aiming higher than fast food."}
{"text":"I had a long time without tasting real Mesquite Charcoal chicken since I've been to the usa, specifically Las Vegas. But no more OMJ this is soooo good, food and service I came for the first time last night with one of my sisters and had come back to bring my mom and son!!!! #chicken #ribs #salad #mac&cheese"}
{"text":"Sweet Jesus. This place is so good. Great service, place is clean, prices are reasonable, food came quick, portions are good and quality is awesome! I wasn't expecting this place to be this good"}
{"text":"This place is very busy around lunchtime. Got here around 11:30 on a Wednesday. Got the chicken Caesar wrap with side of sweet potatoes. Very good food. About $11. A friend got the California chicken club sandwich with the side of corn on the cob and a drink for about $13. They give discounts for seniors and working for certain companies. Plus they give a check in offer for 25% off."}
{"text":"Visiting from Utah & found this place looking for a worthwhile way to spend my Restaurant.com money. Had one of the family meals with my wife & three young kids. I would have given a full five stars but the music was too loud and it seemed a little dirty. The food on the other hand was awesome. The chicken was great and the ribs were even better. When it comes to meat, I feel it is good when I DON'T have to add any sauce. Such was the case with the ribs.  Their mashed potatoes were buttery and flavorful. Their mac & cheese had a nice little kick to them & I liked having some little tortillas on the side. I would definitely recommend this place to others, especially because of the ribs!!"}
{"text":"This is new to the west side of Vegas & has the selection of either salads, bbq ribs/chicken, wraps, etc.  I tried the chicken salad wrap & the ribs with a side of Mac & cheese.    Both of the dishes were good but I do think that it is a little overpriced.  The rotisserie chicken/sides/work station through the clear glass.  Service was pretty slow & some of the employees didn't look very welcoming but at least the inside of the store was clean!"}
{"text":"Really good place! I'm surprise I haven't tried them sooner. Chicken was flavorful but on the drier side. Ribs were falling of the bones. The mash and gravy was good. Reminds me of a better version of El Pollo Loco."}
{"text":"When you hear of charcoal grilled chicken, you know it gotta be good, right? Damn, it gotta be better than the gas grilled El Pollo Loco, according to the cashier. Well, answer will depend on who is doing the cooking. In this case, NCC has failed badly.  I went and visited their southwest location (located on S Rainbows) a week after their grand opening hoping for some delicious chicken. I was so disappointed afterward and here is why:  The chicken is soooooooooooooo dried and way under season. Basically they seasoned just the outside of the chicken, so the only place you can taste some flavor is on the chicken skin. The meat was so dried and bland, it felt like chewing glue instead of chicken.   By the way, for a place that just opened, the restrooms were so nasty and smelly. Good thing I ate before I went there to wash my hands, otherwise the appetite would be ruined. Ewwwwwwwwww.  As for the cashier, the answer is: El Pollo Loco chicken does taste better :-)"}
{"text":"I LOVE their food! The chicken is delicious and my son cannot get enough of their mac and cheese!! This is a great place for the family."}
{"text":"I don't give 5 stars often so know this is deserved. I don't know why anyone would eat anywhere else.. Chipotle is next door and I almost feel sorry for those idiots eating their pound of rice while I'm having chicken salad and fruit for the same price because I got 5$ off when I checked in... Lol eat your stupid burrito morons"}
{"text":"I've been doing the no-carb thing every time I visit Nevada Chicken Cafe, so I have yet to try a lot of their sides. I've had the chicken, ribs, salads, and slaw, though, and their cole-slaw is my favorite in the city. (It's what keeps me coming back, along with the service, honesty).   The chicken and ribs are both tender, juicy and flavorful, even without sauce, which is great in keto and low carb diet world. Add as much or as little as you like? Yes please. The chicken is similar to a \"step above\" something like el Pollo Loco, but the price reflects that as well. Ribs are nibbly and porky and make it feel like not just another low carb chicken meal.  The staff have always been incredibly polite and friendly to me when I visit, and the food comes out fast, making it ideal for takeout or lunch in a hurry.  It's nothing over the moon spectacular, but when you just don't want to cook, or seem like a prick for ordering weird shit, you can totally got keto at NCC."}
{"text":"Purchased the voucher from Yelp and went today. It was a small clean place with attached outside seating.  I placed my order in a walk-up line, was given a number and asked to find a table.  Got a fountain soda while I waited.  I ordered the 1/2 rack of St Louis Ribs with one side (I chose the mashed potatoes and gravy. They were actual potatoes, not the powder type, and good tasting)  I would order that again, as they were very meaty with lots of flavor.  I also got the 1/2 a rotisserie chicken to go, for dinner later. It too was tasty.    Will I go back, probably."}
{"text":"One of the best small restaurants I have Ever been to in years. Not only does the food come out fast BuT the food is fresh and not processed unhealthy. And it taste good."}
{"text":"Think I just found a new fav spot. Hard to pry me from my Asian food obsession but this place sports pretty rocking bbq chicken. didn't try the ribs.  Really liked the baked beans and even more so the saffron rice. Cool spot. Will be back again. May get them to cater an event."}
{"text":"First time here. Very delicious. Big servings. I ordered the pulled pork BBQ sandwich with candied yams and Cole slaw. It was super delicious!! Come down if you're in Vegas."}
{"text":"I just came here for takeout and the service was great my cashier was Amir and he was very patient with me and helped me find the right choice for my meal he was very informational on the meal choices they had. If you get a chance I definitely recommend stopping here to grab a bite!"}
{"text":"Nevada Chicken rarely disappoints. It's clean, service is good, and the restaurant smells wonderful since they barbecue everything in-house.  I especially like their side dishes (not to detract from the chicken and ribs, stars of the show!). Generally in places like this, sides are greasy, fried, or both. Nevada Chicken offers sweet potatoes, fresh fruit, and other healthy options. Entrees automatically come with a yummy green salad, with sprouts, and light vinaigrette dressing. Not your usual barbecue fare.  A co-worker always gets their wraps, and says they're good. But I like their chicken too much to venture far afield.  Wish they also had lighter desserts. Only choices now are cheesecake and chocolate cake. And wish ice tea were a beverage option.  These are small quibbles. Recommend!  PS, yes I stop by often!"}
{"text":"Food is good like always. But the staff needs training in customer service. Ordered food. Ribs were a 20 min wait. So we said just bring out the food and bring us the ribs when they are done....... instead we ended up waiting the entire 20 mins. With a 3year old and a prego wife I wasn't to happy.  6:45 rolls around and they are closing.... started turning customers away. Several customers...... money lost because all the staff wanted to leave at 7pm..... smh. Saw some pissed off faces walk out... Educate your staff on food service."}
{"text":"Finally decided to try this place out.  So here goes nothing.  1. Ordered my 3 year old the kids 2 drumstick kids meal with mac n cheese. Meal also came with a roll and medium sized drink. I tried a bite of the mac n cheese. It was creamy and not too bad. Tasted like they may have added like a chicken seasoning to it or cooked it in chicken broth. Not sure but it was pretty good. My son seemed to enjoy the roll and chicken but didn't care for the mac n cheese. Just wish the kids meal came with a smaller cup for his beverage.  2. I ordered the BBQ chicken sandwich combo with sweet potatoes. The chicken sandwich was ok. I was hoping for pulled/shredded chicken but it came with the chicken cut into chunks. (Which I thought was kind of unusual...Meh) It didn't have much flavor and had more slaw then chicken so I was a little disappointed. I took some of the blueberry BBQ sauce home to try with it. Have to say that was pretty good. The sweet potatoes were bland and didn't have a brown sugar, cinnamon flavor as stated on the menu. I will stick to making my own sweet potatoes at home.  Will I come back. Maybe. Wouldn't be my top choice for BBQ. But I will give it another chance due to forgetting to check in before ordering so I can use the 25% coupon."}
{"text":"I've ordered from this place a couple times through grubhub.com and most recently postmates.com. The chicken and the sides I've tried are great, I get the 4 piece dark meat and 2 sides combo. Most recently, I chose the chicken pasta salad for one of my sides, but I wasn't prepared for how sweet it was. I was expecting something more like a cheese sauce. Be warned. otherwise, everything is very good."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 legs and 2 thighs (rotisserie) and a side of Caesar salad. Omg! The chicken skin was so flavorful and a little crispy. It also comes with a salad and vinaigrette that was tasty. The Caesar salad was pretty large for a side, but I'm not complaining... It was yummy! They use the big croutons, which I love, and a low calorie dressing. My fiancé ordered the ribs and mesquite grilled chicken. He loved the ribs, and I particularly enjoyed their BBQ sauce because it's a little sweet. The smoky mesquite flavor definitely came through. We are definitely coming back to visit Chad the Chicken!"}
{"text":"I give this place 4 stars because it's affordable and a healthy alternative most places we have in Las Vegas.   I usually order the 1/4 chicken and add the charge for white meat. For sides I get sweet potato or chicken pasta (cold). I'm trying mash potato today.   I am a regular at this place. Service is okay depends on who you get but it's not expected at a place like this."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in the food my family and I ate here. We were a family of 4, and for the price the food was awful. I will give credit to them for having great potato salad and mashed potatoes. Other than that it was horrible. The ribs were tough and had a strong vinegar taste to them. The chicken sandwich was awful, tasted nothing like chicken. The macaroni and cheese tasted like it from a package. The service was terrible. All I can say is after this dine in is that I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Pricey for just 2 pieces of Rotisserie chicken . I had the avocado chicken wrap there was only a 1 piece of avocado very bland . Girl a the register had an attitude looked like she hated her job.  Costumer service was horrible not a single person was smiling in that place. Food was just ok."}
{"text":"Fast, delicious, efficient. I had the avocado chicken wrap as it was prepared with no changes. It tasted very fresh and the salad inside was cold and the chicken was hot."}
{"text":"OMG!!! n a resent family vacation to Las Vegas we stumbled across this place & I have to say it was the BEST!!!! The ribs were yummy...& the chicken was moist, just fell off the bone. But my absolute favorite was their chocolate cake with a side of chocolate syrup....mmmm!"}
{"text":"We came here the week it first opened. What a waste of money... For two of us for lunch, we spent around $30, absolutely not worth it.   First of all they didn't have anything we wanted. My husband wanted the pulled pork and they ran out. What would have helped is if they put a sign or blocked out what they didn't have. Or at least mention it before we ordered. No one said anything to us. Actually yes, no one said anything to us till they felt ready to serve us. We stood at the register for a while, the girl running it looked like she was having a really hard day. Felt bad for her. :(  After ordering our food, went to sit, noticed entire place was a mess. There were used dishes on a lot of tables, and the floor was dirty. We wiped down a table to eat at.  They brought us our meal and it wasn't anything we ordered. I ordered a ribs combo and he ordered a chicken combo. We both got two ribs and chicken served to us. In the most unflattering manner. We tried to get it fixed, one guy told me that is how it's served, told me that was what I ordered. Absolutely not, since my husband didn't want any ribs to begin with. I went over to someone else and had it sorted out. They said they would fix the check and do a discount of some sort. We waiting around for 15 minutes for that to happen, nothing, so we just left. As I was leaving I noticed some people had garnish and whatever on their plates. I didn't have any of that. Neither did the guy sitting behind me...   Chicken was dry... Ribs were dry... Too salty, like someone had a bag of salt and served protein with it. Gravy on the potatoes tasted like it came from a fast food joint."}
{"text":"The food is not bad BUT the manager was walking around the kitchen vaping and one of the cooks dropped a utensil on the floor then picked it up, wiped it off on his apron, and started cooking with it again."}
{"text":"Customer service has really went down. I placed a big order recently and realized I forgot to use my 30% discount coupon I had in my purse. I told the guy at the counter that I forgot it and he said he couldn't refund my money cause I didn't give it to him at the time of the order. The whole reason I ordered dinner here is because I had the coupon! Then, we were going to order lunch over the phone for work another day and a co worker asked what was in a wrap and the guy told her she can look online to see. What! I get you are busy during lunch but this place was dead a year ago at lunch. If you want to be dead again then keep up the horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Chicken was ok. A little dry, but flavor was good. Veggies were amazing. Potatoes were a little to crispy but great flavor. Rolls were good. I'd definitely try it again but I'd ask for fresh chicken that hadn't been sitting and not so crispy potatoes."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying this place and my goodness the Ribs and Chicken was off the chain really good and enjoyable. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Just mediocre.  I don't know why anyone would eat here.  Chicken is cooked ok - but it really doesn't have much flavor and the skin is just kind of rubbery and gross.  Garlic ranch sauce they have at the salsa bar is disgusting.  Their pico de gallo is bland - they make it with cucumbers which adds nothing but lack of flavor.  I bought 2 groupons here and used one today.  I won't even bother using the other one."}
{"text":"Service and workers are great, but maybe thats because it's never busy.   Food is good. A much better option than chili's, sammy's, chipotle or anything else in the shopping center, but not a wow omg kind of place and a bit pricey for what you get.   I think rollin smokes is better, but I applaud the clean dining area, nice employees, and food you can tell hasn't been near a microwave except for the The baked beans and mashed potatoes which were sadly unimpressive sides. Like a can of Bush's beans and kfc powder potatoes. Would be a 4 if not for the lackluster options to go with your protein of choice.  They are accurate with their name though the chicken here is definitely the hero of this place, tender, perfectly cooked, the right amount of char, but i grew up on soul food and I'm a sucker for seasoning, which is why despite the nicely done chicken and ribs I probably wouldn't return. Even the bbq sauce was boring. Nothing had a kick of flavor to it."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum! So glad I listened to my fellow yelper Jamie P's review and went here. Amazing food, great service and freshness make the Nevada Chicken Cafe the clear choice in bbq for this area of Vegas.   My husband and I shared the 1/4 white meat chicken which is a wing and breast. We also got the 1/4 of ribs and a side of Mac and cheese and baked beans. I love that they have their own bottles of bbq sauce and hot sauce. Also, for you ranch lovers out there they also have garlic ranch!! Score!! Our meal came with side salads that had their own vinaigrette that was very tangy, but tasty. The chicken was tender & moist and do flavorful. Wow! The ribs! Normally I can't do ribs, but these melted in my mouth and were not greasy at all!! I was very impressed with the Mac and cheese. It was super cheesy and not full of just american cheese. Definitely not from the box. The baked beans were also full of flavor and bbq goodness. Plus, not overly sweet like some places.  The staff was so friendly and patience with us while we were deciding on what to order. I love that you can watch them cook the ribs on the spit. It makes the place smell amazing. The scent can literally draw you in from off the street or if you are just driving by.  I wish I lived closer because I'd be here every week! I can't wait to hit this place up again for more ribs and chicken."}
{"text":"Maybe the most surprising 4.5 stars review I've ever given to a place.  But when it's good, it's good!   And it is simple as that: 1. Delicious chicken!  2. Food got to my table extremely quick.  3. Service was good.  4. Prices are decent.  5. Portions are big!   What else can i ask for?   Bottom line- Great place!  Trust me. I know food!"}
{"text":"I cannot comment on the service too much because I only have done take out. But, the food is pretty good. Especially the chicken, but with a name like they have their chicken better be good. I was not fond of the Mac and Cheese though. I was more like macaroni elbows in Alfredo sauce. Very disappointing. The rice was orange, but actually fairly good. Overall pretty decent. I go back but not for the Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"OMG!! Stop reading this review and go eat here!! Great food, nice environment. Not expensive at all ($24 for both of us) They bring your food to your table and come check in you while eat. Very friendly staff and OMG the blueberry BBQ sauce was out of this world!!!"}
{"text":"Another \"Yelpalicious Dishes\" weekly lunch with Elnino F.  He's the chicken man so we went to a place that specializes in the cluckins.   Got a breast and wing with a side of saffron rice....they gave me an extra chicken piece so thats always nice! It wasn't that the chicken was bad, but it wasn't even warm which makes me think it's been sitting a while and they didn't bother to throw it into the heat even a little.It wasn't dry, but it wasn't juicy either. It made me sad specially since theres a guy in the front grilling these things....why didn't I get a hot one? That was what made me excited to try this place was the smoke I saw coming from it....my chicken did hit the smoke- but hours ago. Saffron rice has buttery and good. Got a watermelon drink and it wasn't very cold and it needed more sugar to contrast how sometimes watermelon gets that \"green\" taste to it.   They have a sauce station with ketchup, bbq sauce, Red Hot sauce and then a garlic sauce, green salsa, a cucumber salad/salsa, jalapenos and baby peppers.  The garlic sauce was more garlic ranch like dressing, but it worked with the meat...I still prefer the real deal garlic sauce a la Zankou chicken. Cucumber salad was a good cooldown since I was eating the peppers and it got a bit hot.  The chicken was the star and without hot and juicy chicken, it can only be an OK lunch at best. I'll try again to see if I can make sure I get one piping hot, but if I can't then I'll have to bawk bawk away and find me some hot cluckin lovin' elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great ribs great chicken. Amazing deserts stellar service. Check out restaurants.com.  Can get a$25 food credit for $10 or less if you watch for sales.  Of course it requires $50 food purchase. Great if getting family deal."}
{"text":"Anerexic chicken!  So we've been wanting to come here for ages because of the smoke and the awesome smell it produced. Located on Sahara next to the Chevron gas station, the Plaza has plenty of parking. Interior is a cute cafe style setup with booths and 7 individual tables that seat 2 people. There is a subway style counter top where you pick your sides. Buy it's not about the sides here, it's called Nevada chicken cafe, so it's all about the pollo, right?!  NOPE!!!  It's all about the sauces.   1. Dry chicken. 2. SKINNY Chicken 3. Dry chicken. 4. Very skinny chicken.   Lololol..  For years and years we thought this would be the spot to beat. So so so disappointed. El pollo Loco has juicier fatter, in fact Popeys  (next door) has healthier chicken than here.  Like I did mention though, the sauces are good. Garlic ranch and the salsa flavors to be exact. Mama Belle and my wife agreed, without them it would be a total loss.   WHY AM I STILL HUNGRY!!!??   As for customer service, the staff seems friendly. Saying seems because the only person who spoke to us was the cashier. 2 employees were eating at customer designated tables, which they shouldnt. SMILE PEOPLE!!!! Shoots, at least pretend your happy you have a job! But that is not my business. Pretty clean inside the cafe. The smell is amazing but very VERY deceiving.   Overall, the smell was a lure. It's up to you to make this call. We tried and failed. We're off to get something else to fulfill our snack appetite."}
{"text":"I love this place. Portions are good. And prices are great. we've never ate there, we always take it to go. I feel like that place is too small for the number of people they get.  Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place today since it was new in the neighborhood....It was terrible!  I ordered the chicken avocado wrap and I personally do not eat avocado or carrots so I asked for it without avocados or carrots. As I was walking out of the store I looked around and noticed that two of the what I have to assume owners cars were parked directly in front of the restaurant taking up guest parking including a spot that isn't even parking. When I got home sat down to eat and opened my food up I was totally disappointed, they got my order wrong, I was hungry so I started to eat around what I didn't like the chicken was dry and had very little flavor. So I gave the other half of my wrap to my husband who isn't picky at all and he didn't even like it. I definitely will not go back! Not to mention I paid $13 for the wrap and a soda...which is wayyyyy to pricey for the quality."}
{"text":"Love their grilled chicken. Haven't tried the other foods they have, but the grilled chicken is really good. Too bad they are kinda far from where we live now so we don't get to buy as often as we used to."}
{"text":"I would have given this place 4 stars purely for using a yelp deal, but if 3 stars means \"A-Ok\" than that is plenty enough for the food I received.  The place was slamming packed at noon on a Saturday so I figured that's a good sign.  I Had the whole cut chicken with mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese to go.  ...Chicken was on the dry side which has been mentioned in a lot of reviews...so I almost kind of expected it. It did have a nice flavor though...maybe they intentionally overcook the chicken due to fear from a salmonella outbreak and don't want to end up closed like Fire Fly.   ***The fact that you can get an equally delicious full roasted chicken hot and fresh from Walmart, Smith's, Sam's Club, etc...for like $6...take it home and have it hot and MOIST is where I really struggle to find the value in the meal I ate had I not had the discount. $21.50 for dry chicken...I would have been pissed without the $10 off.  The macaroni and cheese was average but the mashed potatoes were really good. They still had bits of the red peel from the potato and it was flavored well with a delicious gravy...that was probably the highlight of the meal.   They included 2 tortilla skins and I couldn't figure out what I was to do with them. I know Pollo Tropical has the salsa bar to go with the tortilla but when I waited for my order I sat in front of the TV and watched some NBA playoffs...perhaps it was in the back and I didn't notice.   I ended up making one mashed potato and chicken breast burrito which I don't think I'll ever repeat again...didn't seem to work."}
{"text":"Our 1st time here it was great! I got the Mesquite Chicken and salad it was great . My husband got the sandwich , coleslaw and potato salad we was very full when we left and the price was right too. We will be back"}
{"text":"I have eaten here three times. Everyone always told me how amazing this place was so after trying it the first time (maybe about a year ago), and having a plain, tasteless meal, I figured maybe just a fluke or hopefully they have changed since then. I ate there about 2 months ago and again it was just blah. The third time did it for me when the food was not only gross and tasteless (AGAIN) but two people that work there that I dealt with were extremely rude! Never going back."}
{"text":"Cheap BBQ..its something that they do a great job at but their sides could use some work..i reccomend potato salad, mac n cheese, corn on the cob all the other sides are whatever"}
{"text":"Hands down the best grilled smoke chicken in town. My favor are the daily special or salads (all the salads) costumer service is fast and on point. Clean friendly place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Thank you for not parking the large truck next to IHOP it was a hazard to drive around..."}
{"text":"Ordered a salad get through UberEATS since they have free delivery. The chicken is so good and was a decent portion size too. I will definitely be ordering from here again. I drive my all the time but have never thought to come in. I'm excited to try their other stuff"}
{"text":"I found this place on Restaurant.com & got a $25 off coupon. The ribs ooooh the ribs was lip smacking! The chicken was succulent! It's a great alternative to fried food. The potato salad needed a little sugar to balance out the mustard & mayonnaise. The grilled corn was juicy, the fruit was sweet, the cole slaw I didn't care for, the sweet potatoes were good, sautéed veggies was crispy, & the mac & cheese is a pass. The grill outside will pull you in with the smoke billing from the outside charcoal grill. The rotating grills inside holds some ribs & chicken. We ate there 2 days in a row lol. It's another must return to when I come back to Vegas."}
{"text":"The food was decent so they lose a star there.  We tried the chicken which had good flavor but was a bit dry.  The BBQ sandwich was much the same.  The ribs were killer though.  And the insane amount of side they have is awesome.  All 4 sides we tried were really tasty.  They lose another star because we sat and watched person after person that ordered after us get their togo orders before they even bothered to tell us they messed up on our order.  Their saving grace was the gentleman that work the register there telling us he was sorry and gave us a free dish.  I will try this place again hoping it was a fluke."}
{"text":"I ordered a whole chicken and mashed potatoes with gravy. I felt that the food was very good. The service was just ok but nothing bad.   The worst part is that they serve Pepsi. Pepsi regardless if you like it or not is not only a competitor to food establishments but it is by was very distant second to coca cola in terms of preference nationally.  I will definitely return and enjoy more chicken!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and get the Mozzarella Chicken Wrap.  The best-tasting wrap that I have encountered.  Add some garlic ranch to give it an umph."}
{"text":"My family loves chicken and ribs so we were so excited to check this place out. But we did not know this was a \"healthy\" place...I guess if that's what you're into, then great. But if I'm gonna eat some ribs, I want them fat and juicy. These just didn't hit the spot. And we spent $50 for three of us to have LUNCH. Crazy.   I did see other customers with some salads and wraps that looked pretty good. If we go back, I'll opt for one of those. At least then the healthy part makes sense."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place better than El Pollo Loco, but unfortunately I would have to give El Pollo Loco the edge!   Fiance got the chicken. It was good, no complaints. I tried the tomato mozerella chicken sandwich. The cheese/bread/fixings were great, but the chicken was kinda *eh*. No clue if the chicken they use in the sandwiches is reject meat or what!   The sides were where this place really sucked. I was quite psyched about the generous size of them, but then was disappointed when we ended up throwing it mostly away. Fiance got corn and mac & cheese. Corn was ok, mac and cheese was gross. It was really watery.. basically mac sitting in this watery yellow sauce. I was stupid enough to try the spinach feta pasta. I assumed the green pasta meant the pasta itself was spinach pasta. HA. it was white pasta covered in a disgusting spinach sauce. It basically tasted like cold boiled spinach. EW.   I'd try them again, but I'd avoid the mac and cheese and pasta next time!"}
{"text":"Chicken is the best here! All of their sides are good!!!  I love their mashed potatoes and rotisserie chicken. Get the stamp card because you will go often!!"}
{"text":"The Nevada Chicken Cafe is always a nice family dinner to-go restaurant.  They offer a variety of  sides, which are a little pricey, but how can one truly complain when you are able to get just about any sides item from healthy to just down right delicious in one stop.  They also offer, salads, wraps, chicken and ribs.  In addition to offering various meats, they have combo meals, daily specials, and family deals.   In regards to the taste of the food, it  is a hits or miss in regards to their seasoning.  Sometimes their food seasoning and quality is spot on, while other times it can be very salty and burnt.  Last night was my first time receiving overall salty ribs, chicken and the chicken was burnt.  Even with this being said, I would still go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the 1st time today and was Highly Disappointed!  I ordered the 1/4 Rib, Leg & Thigh Combo with Mac&Cheese. Although the Chicken was cooked all the way through it Lacked Flavor. Just Salt and Pepper, and  No Mesquite or any other type of BBQ smoke I was expecting. Heck, the BBQ I cooked last night with plain ole Kingsford briquettes gave More Flavor than this place.  Ribs were Tough, not anywhere close to Fall Off the Bone, lacked Flavor too.  BBQ sauce, I don't know where they hid it, I saw the bottles of Hot Sauce, Not Labeled by the way, a weird watery Salsa, the Ranch Dressing, and Whatever diced up salad, but No BBQ sauce.  Mac&Cheese, I think someone Forgot to Add the Cheese, it was just Mac&Some Creamy salted substance.  After hearing about the Sahara location, I was excited about the New Location in my neck of the woods, but after spending almost $13, I don't think I'll be coming back any time soon. Maybe I'll try the Sahara location, who knows.  2 Stars for the Cleanliness and Nice staff, but for a Restaurant, the Food Needs to be Flavorful and Needs to Taste good!"}
{"text":"Chicken was decent at best. Mashed potatoes were fine. Fruit salad was the best part and it used canned pineapple. The diet pepsi in the soda machine was out of syrup and no one fixed it after i mentioned it. This aims for a fast casual dining experience akin to panera or California Chicken Cafe but comes up pretty short."}
{"text":"Excellent chicken and superb service.  They know what they are doing when it comes to grilling.  Great side  dishes too.  Must  visit."}
{"text":"Delish Chicken & Ribs ! Without a doubt the best BBQ in Vegas! Super fresh everyday all the sides are yummy too! Our family has eaten here weekly since they opened!"}
{"text":"This place is always delicious! The smell makes me hungry.  They have a daily special I like to try. It forces me to get new things. The Waldorf Salad is my favorite."}
{"text":"There is nothing like the combination of great food with even greater people! The food is always fresh and tasting great, the staff at Nevada Chicken are always friendly and smiling. They are like a family ran business, everyone doing there part and always making sure the customer service is A1! I usually come in about 4 times a week after leaving my office, and never have I been dissapointed. Even when the chicken runs out the friendly staff make sure they keep me a happy customer in this case it was Darla at the front who very happily gave me other options to choose from and made sure I still had a pleasant dinner. As for the rest of the crew, Silvia, Jenny, Beatriz, Marielo, and basically everyone who works there always seems to be very positive and smiling. The staff is always very happy to see customers come in and sometimes I even show up at 10 minutes prior to them closing and they always help me with the amazing customer service and delicious food. I highly recommend the food and you will become a regular!"}
{"text":"Used a Yelp voucher and got the 1/4 rack ribs and chicken (leg/thigh) combo with mac & cheese as a side.    Chicken and ribs were pretty good - both a tiny bit on the dry side but still very flavorful. Mac & cheese was very bland and didn't taste like anything.    Would definitely come back for the chicken, although I do think it is a bit pricey without the voucher."}
{"text":"After years of passing by this place we finally decided to stop and try it, and i'm glad to say it did not let us down. The chicken wings and ribs were delicious and freshly grilled. The mac&cheese was good but the mash potatoes were salty, the corn is out of a can but i don't care since i didn't go for the corn. The cucumber salad is really good too. The place was very clean and has good customer service. All in all we will be back soon.  loved the outdoor seating!"}
{"text":"Recently we decided to try this place. With high hopes we walked in and loved the smell. The menu is easy to navigate. I walked up to order my family meal and waited while the order taker talked to the kitchen staff for about two minutes. Then she took my order and was fairly rude while doing it. I asked a few questions as it was my first time. She was very snippy and not very clear. She asked if I wanted baby back ribs or  St. Louis ribs? I said we'll let me ask my family she said 'oh we'll you'll get the St. Louis because we ain't got anything else.' I was finished ordering and was highly disappointed in my first experience at this restaurant.   Our food came and the lady set it down and walked away with a huff and puff. Very strange no ok here is your food or do you need anything else or enjoy your meal. Just a huff and puff. We started eating and realized they gave us half of our tortillas and only one side. I went to correct this and get our food (thinking it was just a misunderstanding). The lady (same one from ordering)said oh we brought you all of your food. Then she checked with the kitchen people and realized she was wrong and got me my food without apologizing. Oh and the claim that their tortillas are 'homemade' they aren't. You can go next door to walmart and buy the 'uncooked' tortillas in the refrigerated section. They are the same.   Finally we sat down to eat and it was delicious. The food was great! I would love to eat here fairly often. The sauce bar had two sauces and a bunch of empty spaces. The bathroom was clean. The eating area was clean. The music was horrendous. It was loud and was--what I imagine-- club music to be. There was some language that was not great for a family with small children.   I will be back but only for the food and probably after I forget about the terrible service! Maybe for take out."}
{"text":"Decided to try again.  While waiting to order watched  cook bend over in front of the grill, blew his nose several times and picked up the tongs and flipped the chicken. Went over, told the owner what I saw, he stated, \"he would have him use different tongs\".  Um, what about he blew his nose where the food is being cooked, orders prepared and food is exposed.   I will be reporting right after this review to the health department.  He owns all of these cafes so I am certain conditions are similar. This is beyond gross!!!!   Part2: Great response from the owner, no accountability.  I have filed with Clark County Health Department sling with the video ( smarter than you think). In addition, my son is an inspector.  Thank you for your nice response!!!"}
{"text":"Then about a chicken café is a great place to go if you like dry rub ribs. Ever since I found the place I keep going about once a month to get my rib fix if you like sauce on your ribs they also have their own house sauces"}
{"text":"The chicken was bomb! Eat it all at once bc like most bbq chicken, gets kind of tough after a while. They serve organic chicken, supposedly so that is a very good thing!"}
{"text":"Went here the other day with some family. Not very good. The ambiance was great with the smell of meats cooking but was not delivered when we ate. The employees seemed less than thrilled to be working, soda machine had no ice, condiments were in 2\" of ice water, and the temperature inside was not tolerable just so many things that were weird.  Took the combo selection of ribs and chicken with bbq beans. The ribs were a that of a boiled mess with some seasoning spattered on it, not tender and tasteless. The chicken had the same seasoning on it and was as dry as the desert heat outside. All served with a mini salad on the side.  Wanted to come here for quite sometime but left me less than thrilled. Sad day"}
{"text":"On our way to get our vehicle registered, we stopped in here for lunch.  It was a clean facility with friendly staff and healthy food options.  Hubby for the 1/2 chicken with breast and wing just like I did and he had their mashed potatoes with a side of veggies. I had the side of veggies along with the broccoli salad. The broccoli salad was a mix of pasta and italian dressing and veggies...the food was good, but nothing surprisingly amazing.   There was a fresh bar with pico, salsa (spicy) and limes with sauces to try also.  If you're looking for a healthier food option that's simple and quick this is the place!"}
{"text":"I waited almost an hour for my order. When I went ask ask about my order I was informed that my order was already ready and was sitting in a bag on the counter for God knows how long. I had my number stand on the table and no one let me know that my order was ready.And when I got home I noticed that my order was not right. I will NEVER return to this place!"}
{"text":"First time here.. Ordered the combo Chicken and Ribs, it came with a side and drink. I would describe the flavors as salt and pepper with some additional mild seasonings (there are some self serve BBQ sauce on the side). Both the chicken and ribs were cooked to a nicely crispy outer crust. Just a little dry, so not a lot of fat on either of the meats.  I'd say this is a healthy version of eating ribs. Low sodium, fats, and nothing was burnt.   So long as this place can stay consistent with their cooking, I thought it was fine and I'll return. Price was around $12-$13 for the combo dish."}
{"text":"We had a hankering for ribs. We did our typical Yelp search and saw a few and were on our way. However, while driving we saw this place and honestly we've seen it a hundred times, but never stopped. So this time we said what the heck. There was this guy on the grill outside, all the aromas were there. We went inside, not pretty, so it's not a first date place unless your date likes to go to a bit of a dive. The ribs and chicken were very good and the sides of mashed and slaw were decent. We'll go back"}
{"text":"I drove by this place for ages, always wondering what the food tasted like, and more than a little entranced by their giant inflatable chicken man that would shill on their roof or on the sidewalk next to the chicken cafe.    I'm not going to lie: Every time I drove by, I've secretly hoped that Peter Griffin from \"The Family Guy\" would run out of nowhere, and the two would engage in epic fisticuffs for my own amusement (or to make my time at the stop light go by faster).  Regardless of my dreams unrealized, I decided to break down and actually go into this place.  I'm glad that I did.  You'll see the little man grilling to his heart's content when you first walk up, and he'll cheerfully wave while you smell the chicken and ribs cooking.  The entry door's a little tricky to find (it's at the far left), but inside, it is a veritable mecca of chicken.  And it's good.  The side dishes are no slouch, either, all filled with fresh veggie goodness, and your choice or light or dark meat, chicken or ribs, and it's certainly filling.  The mashed potatoes were especially notable, and while I haven't gone the rib route, the chicken is flavorful.  It's usually around a $10 meal (perhaps a little less), so if on a tight budget, it may not be a \"cheap\" dining alternative.  However, the food is fast, it's grilled right in front of you, and it's tasty.  Now when I drive past, I see the little grill man and the inflatable chicken, and will be tempted to go in at times, and occasionally act on that urge.  While I still wait for my inevitable \"Peter Griffin Vs. Giant Chicken\" fight, at least the food is good enough to pass the time until that eventual reward."}
{"text":"Second and last time here. First time made me want to go back, but second time was disaster. Chicken was DRY, whether grilled or off the rotisserie. I missed out on a SIGNIFICANT amount of chicken because it was so dry it became stringy and inedible. Side portions are big, which redeemed the rating. Again, I won't be eating here next time I visit."}
{"text":"Pretty good! I'd probably recommend Peru Chicken for just the chicken taste alone but the sides and quality overall is higher at Nevada Chicken."}
{"text":"I drive by this place everyday on the way to work and it always smells so delicious when I drive by in the afternoon, but I think the catch is that any caveman can throw a slab of meat on a hot surface and our inner carnivore will growl a quick yummmmm and then move on. I wish I would have taken the move on advice in this case.   I suggested we order lunch from this place for work and we passed the menu around in amazement at all of the option that we had and the ordering began. Once lunch was picked up and brought back we all quickly dug in and then we all quickly stopped digging in. There was a mix of things ordered, Chicken Wraps, 3 piece plates, and sides like mac and cheese and ceaser salads.  I am not overly picky but I will say the chicken in my wrap was EXTREMELY dry and there was absolutely no flavor to the entire wrap. The coworker to my right stopped eating his plain chicken and cheese wrap after he pulled 4 bones out of it and to top it off, one of my other co workers could not stand to eat his mac and cheese because it was so runny..   I apologize now to all of you Nevada Chicken lovers that may be reading this but this place was absolutely horrible and I think we will be going back to ordering El Pollo Loco as sad as that is."}
{"text":"I had one of the best experience today at Nevada chicken Café, the workers are great  people but one employee stand out to me which was Ana Hernandez. She is super nice with the customers and has a lot of patience with them. In conclusión I really recommend to go to eat there because the food was extraodinary delicious."}
{"text":"I've only tried the ribs so that's what I'll review.  I love ribs. I've met few ribs I didn't gobble up. And yes, I did devour these but they were far from my favorite.   I found them to be a little salty and dry. They have a dry rub, which I like and come with a side of BBQ sauce. The dry rub would have been better with less salt. The BBQ sauce is also only okay. The ribs are soft, but definitely not fall off the bone tender.  The macaroni and cheese wasn't to my liking. It is creamy, just as advertised. But somehow it doesn't taste very cheesy. Mine was also very soupy and better eaten with a spoon than and fork."}
{"text":"Have driven past this place numerous times and finally decided to try it out. We ordered the 3 piece meal with Mac and Cheese and the Rib and Chicken combo with potatoes.  Different experience than we thought. We sat down and food was brought to us on plates versus a styrofoam box.   Food was good. Chicken was rotisserie and had good flavor. The ribs were really good. We should have ordered a full rack!   The offer food to go and in family meals. We will be coming back to order more."}
{"text":"Wow! They best chicken and ribs in las Vegas. Great favor and also very healthy options. They have an amazing buffet with every side you can imagine. I had the mash potatoes which are amazing. They staff was very friendly. The manager even took time to explain what everything was. Definatly coming back and Will recommend them to my friends."}
{"text":"The only reason it's getting 4 stars instead of 5 is because my BBQ chicken wings were extremely over cooked as were my ribs. BUT the chicken breast was hands down the best! Seasoned amazing. The Mac and cheese didn't look like anything special, but it surprised me! Their salsa is too die for. I'll definitely come back! Also, the girl working the register was super friendly!"}
{"text":"Great food. best ribs I have had in my life.   Very juicy and delicious. I love their BBQ sauce.  I wish they were sell the BBQ sauce separately.  I was visiting for San Diego and wish they opened a branch there."}
{"text":"It was really good and has a huge selection of just not chicken it also had ribs. Everything is cooked on a big grill outback. It's always packed but they do have a lot of specials and everything is always fresh."}
{"text":"Nevada chicken cafe ... you changed.   As previously I mentioned I strictly only come here for the ribs because they don't disappoint ... but oh noooo ... they disappointed me.  First I must mention the flavor is the same ... so kudos for not changing your flavor.    1.  Numbers don't lie  The fiancé and I always order a full rack of ribs to share.  Instead of it just stating \"full rack\" they recently updated the menu and it states a full rack is 12 ribs.  When we were close to being done, we realized we only got 11/12 ribs.   We didn't say anything because we didn't want to be the D-bag person to go back and ask just for 1 rib.   However l, if you're gonna change your menu and add a specific number, I think it's important that the cook or whoever plates the food counts to 12.  Double count if you need to.  I wouldn't have cared or noticed how many ribs you get for a full rack, but just because you added a number ... I noticed and now I care.      2.  You got skinny  I know it's 2016, the start of the new year, people got goals to stay skinny ... but did the ribs have to suffer ??? My fiancé and I are always stuffed, maybe overstuffed even after throwing down a full rack of ribs, but when we were finished we were questioning if we should've ordered more.    There's hardly any meat on the ribs now.   You can view the pics to see the difference from what I got and previous photos of ribs.     I still got high hopes for you Nevada Chicken Cafe ... I hope tonight was just a rough night and things will get better in the morning.       To be continued ..."}
{"text":"I bought a Family Meal and a whole chicken yesterday. It was very disappointing, the ribs were not as flavorful and wasn't moist at all. The chicken was ok but a bit too salty. The side broccoli and pasta was spoiled. I had to throw it out. I don't recommend this place for a family last minute gathering. Next time we'll just BBQ ourselves."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch twice and both times I was disappointed. First of all the manager or whoever he was wearing street clothes filling salads and sides with his bare hands after handling money and his personal cell phone was a huge turn off.. Secondly both time I went I ordered a wrap. They say they're handmade tortilla which is a bullsh%&, each time the wrap fell apart when I opened it and each time the wrap had small bones still in the chicken....... REALLY? You can't even train your staff to take bones out of chicken? Poorly managed!! The California chicken cafe is what turned me into this spot, it's amazing in California. Actually real slow cooked rotisserie chicken, not 1 hour fast food style rotisserie. Might as well be a cheap el pollo loco, el pollo loco has them beat by a large margin!!!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad I stopped in for lunch today! The food is delicious and made with fresh ingredients. They have specials every day of the week that are very reasonably priced. I had the chicken avocado wrap and a cup of chicken veggie soup. The wrap is huge and I will have the other half for dinner! Can't wait to come back and try something else.   Oh,  and when you check in you get 25% off!"}
{"text":"Best bbq chicken in Las Vegas, hands down! The seasoning is addictive.  Quality ingredients, great sides.  Excellent service!"}
{"text":"I met the owners at their home and helped protect their family by setting up a home alarm system for them. In exchange Niko and Ladan invited me to try their restaurant on the house. I did so without hesitation. Was not disappointed. Ordered a full rack of baby backs, half a chicken, mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, vegetables, and chicken chili. The ribs were tender and flavorful, the chicken had an incredible smokey flavor, and the sides were amazing. The chicken chili was on point. First time was free and it made me a believe. I will definitely be frequenting the nevada chicken cafe. Thanks Niko and Ladan, I'll see you guys again soon I hope."}
{"text":"I passed by this place several times and was curious and stopped in for lunch one day. It is a nice clean place with friendly service. I had a chicken wrap with house dressing. It was a huge wrap, but not very tasty. I ate one third of it. The baked beans and potatoes salad were not very good either. I regret not having just plain chicken or ribs. They looked and smelled good. I'm not sure that I will go back because the television was on Fox News. I could never sit through that again. Public places should never have televisions on stations that may offend their customers. It would have been better to have it off."}
{"text":"Excellent chicken! These guys know how to grill chicken. Great smoky flavor! I don't know what it is about the Mac n cheese- but it's exceptional as well. Whenever we are in town we pick up dinner from here at least once."}
{"text":"I'll admit that I had low expectations for this place.  Figured it was like an El Pollo Loco rip-off and I'm not a fan of that.  Got a 30% coupon in the mail and felt like some chicken so thought I'd give it a shot.  Called in an order but was put on hold for a looooong time during off peak hours.. Maybe about 3 pm.  So thought that was odd that they seemed busy.  Girl on the phone just took the order... My meal came with sides and a couple choices of how the food would be prepared.  But she didn't ask or give options so luckily I had menu in front of my face so I could order correctly and make sure I got everything I was supposed to.  So not an impressive start.  Picked up food and they were not busy so again... Not sure why I was on hold so long.  But really enjoyed the food and pleasantly surprised on how well everything was cooked and the flavors of everything were outstanding.  I'd actually give 4 or maybe even 5 stars if service wasn't lacking.  Also, price seems a bit on the high side without the coupon, but was pleasantly surprised in the end.  Give it a shot!   We had chicken and ribs with mashed potatoes, Mac n cheese, and a Caesar Salad.   All terrific!"}
{"text":"The chicken was dry. Ribs were very chewy we had to rip the meat off the bone. It definitely did not fall of the bone."}
{"text":"Everything was great except the Mac n cheese was horrible. Taste like it came from a box... however, I would come back and I would recommend the food."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, their chicken is always juicy and flavorful.   Unfortunately I messed up and while ordering online I somehow ended up with vegan wrap super disappointing since their chicken is so delicious. I ruined my dinner plans thinking that while ordering from a \"chicken\" place that their wraps would include chicken.   Under the make your own wrap category there is no option to \"add chicken\" so I thought that would mean it's already included. Little did I know that I needed to write add chicken is the special options box which is usually used for items like no onion or whatever.   I called and explained my issue to the store and although the person on the phone was nice she was unhelpful by just telling me I needed to know that chicken is always extra.   It's a f@$king chicken restaurant, why would chicken be extra!   I'll give you guys another try but I probably won't ever attempt to order a wrap again. What a waste of my time. And now I'm hungry and have a stupid veggie wrap I spent 24$ on"}
{"text":"My first time here. I had half a chicken, mashed potatoes and gravy on the side. It came with a tortilla so I didn't need to buy the potatoes for carbs although. It also had some greens so it was quite easy for me to build my own burrito and get some garlic ranch from the salsa bar :-)   You can see how they make the ribs and chicken in the back. Check out my video on that. Pretty cool place with legit food.  Will definitively come back. Yum yum!"}
{"text":"The newest location for Nevada Chicken Cafe is located between the other two locations near the Tropicana and 215 beltway in a sprawling shopping center.  At first glance the kitchen is open and the restaurant is very spacious.  The smell of rotisserie chicken permeates the air upon entry and gets you hungry if you weren't already.  The menu is identical to the other locations and quality of food is consistent.  My go to is definitely the ribs and chicken combo along with a tortilla and one side dish.  The list of hot and cold side dishes is very diverse and I recommend changing them up every visit.  My favorite sides include the mashed potatoes, corn on the cob, broccoli pasta salad and sautéed veggies.  My only knock on this location was the service given during ordering and checkout, the cashier seemed to be annoyed when i couldn't hear him and seemed to have an attitude.  Overall a great location with great food!"}
{"text":"Nevada Chicken Cafe specializes in rotisserie chicken and pork ribs.  I usually do the chic-n-ribs combo which includes 1/4 rack of ribs, leg & thigh, one regular side and a fountain drink.  They recently raised the price which I'm not happy about but still frequent their three locations in town since the food is freshly cooked and consistent.  The original location has been around since I was a kid growing up in Las Vegas and I remember passing it everyday in high school.  Nevada Chicken Cafe has stood the test of time in a competitive industry and I recommend checking them out for the chicken, ribs and wraps.  The sandwich combos look very delicious as well and I hope to try them in future visits.  The selection of hot and cold side dishes also makes Nevada Chicken Cafe stand out with favorites that include the mashed potatoes, corn on the cob, sautéed veggies and mini salads."}
{"text":"My go to lunch spot on Saturdays for their chicken and ribs combo special.  Nevada Chicken Cafe is rotisserie chicken at its finest!  The ribs are great as well, hence the combo is a must try.  Plenty of hot and cold sides to chose from that complement the chicken and ribs well.  My usual side is the corn on the cob but I recommend the mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, fruit salad, regular salad, pasta salad as well.  The two locations are very convenient and service is always fast when ordering and getting the food.  Definitely try the regular and blueberry BBQ sauces on your chicken and/or ribs.  The blueberry sauce has more of a tang and I enjoy switching between the regular and the blueberry.  Also try the garlic spread and the salsa with the chicken, great combination with the supplied flour tortilla.  Enjoy Nevada Chicken Cafe!"}
{"text":"I just love the food here. It's my go-to place for quick fresh and delicious food. Whatever rub they put on the ribs is magical. They don't even need barbecue sauce. And I can't rave enough about the salads. With garlic ranch or Dijon balsamic. So delicious. The staff is efficient and friendly. Great place for low carb, vegetarian, or just plain good food."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for over two years. This is probably the only place I know with good grilled chicken that isn't dry. Hands down the best grilled chicken in the city. The sides are also good but the problem with them is they are ridiculously inconsistent. Half of the time I order a grilled chicken I'll get all or part of the chicken baked/rotissiere. The other half feels like I'm missing pieces. It is one of the best places for grilled chicken but with how far it is and the inconsistencies of my orders, it's hard to give this place over three stars."}
{"text":"Wow, stopped in on a whim as we were doing some shopping and hadn't had lunch. It was AMAZING. I had the bbq chicken plate. I went to another place in my mind while I was eating it.  I loved it so much, we went back the next week.  The experience was the same, AMAZING!  There's just the right balance of sauce which is not too sweet or tangy. The additional coleslaw kicks it up a notch.  The side choices are all fresh too.  Definitely telling everyone about this place."}
{"text":"This place was So delicious!!! The staff was super friendly! Such great Great service!!! The Mac n cheese was the bomb!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered around 120 dollars in food for our office, feeding around 10 employees. Received a call about 10 minutes before the ETA I was given at checkout and I was told it would take a bit longer to receive our order. No problem, it's a lot of food and there are a lot of people that eat there. What is a problem is to then neglect bringing any drinks for any of our orders and not responding to my inquiries to at least receive a refund for the items we did not receive. The food was pretty good but I can't justify ordering from somewhere that not only doesn't deliver 100% of your order but then on top of that doesn't do the right thing. Maybe limit your visits with this establishment to dine-in only."}
{"text":"Nevada chicken cafe is truly great food. I love it and their healthy options really meet my nutritional needs. I will say that their customer service is really lacking. No one smiles. We went in as we often do and got the whole chicken with 2 sides which is under the family meal on their display tvs. The lady said \"it's not a family meal\". No further discussion that it's under where it says family meal.. whatever okay no big deal it doesn't give me 3.00 off on sundays, but the way she said it was just really abrupt and rude.. I'm not sure how many more times I will come here if this is the level of service offered.  P.S. why is the menu (TV's) not viewable from where you order?  Update:  I returned after the owner reached out to me. It seems their customer service has improved and they were very friendly. Once again there was absolutely no problem with their food, it's incredibly good!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times.  Went today about an hour ago and got a house special salad and they forgot the cucumbers...and there was a piece of bone in the chicken.  Just lazy. Their ranch dressing is gross...definitely Hidden Valley from a bottle.  Last time I had a pulled pork sandwich and it was really good...maybe I should just stay away from the salads."}
{"text":"I ordered one of their family meals to go that includes chicken, salad, and 2 sides. The portions are big and the meals there are delicious. I have always enjoyed the chicken and love the delicious brown dipping sauce they have. The online ordering process is very convenient and service is good. The portions are so big there are definitely leftovers for tomorrow. Most importantly, my kiddos love the mac and cheese. If you're looking for an easy appetizing family meal, check out Nevada Chicken Cafe."}
{"text":"My last experience was mixed, so the owner was gracious enough to give me a complimentary meal to make up for it.  I went back to the Arroyo location and spoke with the manager.  He apologized up and down and then gave me an amazing meal - 4 piece dark and sweet potatoes.  Might have been the best tasting one yet!  Nevada Chicken is back on the top of my list with amazing chicken!"}
{"text":"located close to my work, and have gone here previously before, it had been awhile since I had been for lunch so headed on over. Unfortunately, it seems like this location has become the mecca for lunch because the line to order was super long, and only one person taking the orders. After about 15 minutes in line, I placed the order to go and just had a seat off to the side, but then it was another 15+ minutes to get my order and for a to-go-order this is simply too long in my book.   While the food is good and the reason why it has become more busy and a noticeable change in the menus, again, it has been a while since I have been here so maybe the menu was updated long ago, I feel the Nevada Chicken Cafe has lost some of its good old fashion edge.   While I'm hoping other days are fast and quick for orders, this day was certainly much slower. My order was made great and no denying the food is good but for a quick lunch location, this will not be my first choice next time."}
{"text":"The food here is great! The service not so much! They're rude. So rude that even when they acknowledge us there instead of saying one moment they continued to just do whatever they were doing. The second time I came in to dine in I had to clear my own booth that was filled with food even tho a lady saw us there just stared at us then walked away."}
{"text":"The restaurant was well maintained and clean.  All of the staff that I encountered were pleasant and helpful.  I had the BBQ chicken sandwich, which was okay. I have to agree with some of the other posters that the smoke flavor on the chicken is not really present.  The chicken was tender, but more seasoning and smoke would significantly enhance the flavor.  The BBQ sauce was a bit sweet for my tastes, and it would have been nice to have a choice of sauce.  The mac and cheese was pretty good, 4.5/5 for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Food was tasty, service was great. I had never been there before but they were so patient and helpful. Chicken was yummy like El Pollo Loco, but the sides are way better and freshly made."}
{"text":"New location- 215/Rainbow towards the back by Chipotle.  I was so excited when I saw this here, this is by far the BEST Rotisserie chicken in Las Vegas.  If you order to eat there you are served on real plates.  The food is so melt in your mouth delicious.  Portions are very generous and you are even served a little side salad.  Super fresh fruit & vegetables"}
{"text":"Just came here for the first time and probably won't be back anytime soon. The inside of the restaurant is super clean and the staff is very friendly.  Now for the food, I got the pulled pork sandwich for $8.50 and it comes with a side and I got the mashed potatoes and gravy.  The potatoes were so delicious and they come in a pretty big portion.  The BBQ sandwich was so gross.  A lot of the meat was fatty and the sauce they put on it was disgusting!  It is a pretty big sandwich though"}
{"text":"Back again love this chicken Caroline took care of me again...I ate salad with my half of chicken today with there house dressing..mmmm mmmm good."}
{"text":"I went into the Restaurant to order a Rib and Chicken combo only to find out the did not have any ribs.  So I ordered a 3 piece chicken meal with 2 sides.  The two sides I wanted they were also out of so I ordered mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese.  The potatoes were cold and the macaroni tasted like water.  In addition the chicken was dry.  On top of all of this the juveniles working behind the counter were more interested in yelling at each other than cooking.  This place is not worth the money and time it takes to get a meal."}
{"text":"We both had the rib chicken combo.  I had sweet potato side, she the potato side!  It was all great can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"I totally agree with some of the other reviews I have read. We have always gone by here and wanted to stop since we are both lovers of Chicken. So we wanted to stop and try it out. Well when you walk in the place is small, and packed. It was hard to find a empty table, Once we ordered we sat down and waited,, Seemed like for a while, The food is very good but you do not get enough for what you pay. The sides are very small. It was a good place to say ~  Hey I went there but not to say we are going back!. Well not too soon anytime in the near future I am sure."}
{"text":"I am addicted to the ribs with no sauce!  My husband loves the chicken.  We've been to this location many times and never disappointed.  It's just to bad the employees   look so unhappy not all of them just 95% of them.  I wonder what that's about.  You have to try this lace"}
{"text":"The mashed potatoes are my fav! The meat is made right then and there and is delicious! Service is always wonderful."}
{"text":"So, I walked in here hoping that this would be like the California Chicken Cafe, but Nevada version. It was pleasantly surprised to find that they offer ribs.   Ribs- 3.5 star. They were good. BBQ sauce made it better. It wasn't the best ribs I've ever had in my life, but I'd get them if I were in the mood and couldn't find anywhere else to get them.   Chicken- 2 star.  It wasn't juicy, flavorful, and the best part was the skin. I was hoping that the flavor would have infused inside the chicken, but it was a meh.   Make sure to check-in before  you pay, so that you can get $5 off your bill. I couldn't get my discount since it was AFTER I had already paid.  I'd come back and try a few other things. Staff were friendly and super nice. Kudos for that!"}
{"text":"Best chicken ever !!! Make sure to ask for Mesquite over Rotisserie. It's seasoned and charred perfectly, its juicy, delicious, healthy and satisfying. The hot sauce is super bomb! I love the chicken and vegetable soup as well. And if you want to splurge on calories and deliciousness the mac and cheese and ribs are legendary. We order Nevada Chicken literally 2 to 4 times a week! Get it!!!!"}
{"text":"The perfect place for lunch or a great takeout dinner.  My husband loves the ribs and I am a huge fan of the chicken caesar salad.  You can add whatever you like to the salad for the same price and the portions are very large.  Everything we have had here has been wonderful!"}
{"text":"To start I was not greeted when I walked in nor were other customers that followed me in after I arrived so I know that it was not just me personally. Once I received my take-out order there was no- thanks come back again or have a great day...nothing said at all... food put down in front of me and waitress walked away. I know Vegas doesn't have the best customer service at times... but this by far was the worst that I have ever experienced out here and no doubt will never return. I even witnessed a supervisor or manager having to confront customers over an issue and then take one of the rude employees to the back still within open line sight and hearing to let her know that the behavior was not correct. Be coaching did not seem to help because her attitude appeared to of gotten worse."}
{"text":"So good and fresh. The BBQ pulled pork was so juicy. Seating can be difficult to come by and some of the staff like to rush you, but just go for the food. It's totally worth it."}
{"text":"MY GOD Why don't more people know of this place??? Admittably the signage is hard to spot and you have to access it by spinning around on Sahara but the aroma alone will draw you from blocks away! They smoke/grill their meats inside and out in front and the flavor is magical. It does beat places in town that charge TWICE as much. The inside is comfortably humble so you feel fine \"digging into your meal\". They have a great array of sides. Dine there once and you may never throw a backyard BBQ again! No need; you'll come here instead! Cheaper and easier... BETTER."}
{"text":"Do not go here. I had no breakfast and ate lunch here. 2 or 3 hrs later i started feeling sick. How could it be something else? I had no other food.  I would never come back to this place.  Chicken didnt taste so good and sides were barely average.   Be very careful.  Dont make the same mistake i did."}
{"text":"they're not that great, especially for the price. but I will say the location off of rainbow is much less crowded and friendlier. this place just tried to stuff as many tables inside as they could and I don't think it's necessary for the small amount of business I always see in there. I'm still on the hunt for some amazing ribs."}
{"text":"If you like chicken and house music, you'll love this place.  I actually liked the food, but whoever is selecting the music over there apparently spends his/her evenings at every club on the Strip and just can't get enough.  I got stressed while trying enjoy my food and had to leave.  If they change the music, I give this place 4 stars."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and I absolutely LOVE the food. I got the 6 bone ribs with 2 sides. The ribs were tender, and so welled seasoned, that I didn't even use any of the sauce (on the side) The potato salad is one of the best that I've ever had, it's fresh and homemade. I'd go back there just to get the potato salad. The baked beans were very tasty also. The meal was enough for two people. I also got the Pumpkin Cheesecake, and it was also delicious. I honestly like their food better than Famous Dave's. It's close to my house so I'll definitely be a frequent customer.  Went back there again today. Got the same exact combo as yesterday, and EVERYTHING was delicious just like yesterday"}
{"text":"I actually spent sometime deciding if I wanted to give this place 3-4 stars. The details I will describe below will clearly explain why I decided to give this place 3 instead of 4. I went today and ordered a full rack of ribs and macaroni and cheese.   The menu is pretty solid and clearly posted when you walk in. After I ordered my food I noticed that all the empty tables had trash on it. I had to ask them to clear off a table so I can have a place to sit. BTW the place wasn't crowded. maybe half the tables were occupied. They give you a flag with a number so they now where to bring your food. Once the ribs were dropped off. Yes dropped off, because the person didn't say a word after dropping the food off. I had to ask where the BBQ sauce were. I felt like someone should have told me that the sauces were near the soda machine. I also had to wipe down the bottle because it was sauce of over them. The ribs were good, but the mac and cheese seemed to be watery. This might be my 3rd time there and the food seems really franchise-like.   Pros - Location, Ribs,   Cons - Not the cleanest place, customer service, variety of sauces.  sides are mediocre."}
{"text":"The food is excellent! Crisp, juicy and tasty corn on the cob, roasted garlic potatoes, chicken, and ribs!  I came in between lunch and dinner rush.  The employees were very friendly and everyone Busy cleaning... Detail cleaning! Very refreshing to see!"}
{"text":"Love Nevada Chicken Cafe seriously one of my favorite places to eat in Las Vegas!!  Was so happy to see they opened one next to my house on Ft. Apache, only sad I moved away!  Have eaten at the Ft. Apache location multiple times since they opened.  My son loves the food here just as much as I do!  Restaurant is super clean and bright wait isnt too long!   The food is always so fresh and delicious, the customer service has always been on point, and one night the manager even gave us a $20 gift card for just being there.  Please open one in Henderson!!  If not I will still come here when I drop my son off at aunties house!!    Thanks!  Jessica and little Alaric"}
{"text":"Love the chicken wrap & Caesar salad  also all the employees are very friendly  with a Pleasant greeting at the door."}
{"text":"I came in for dark meat chicken and ended up ordering the chicken and rib combo (with Chicken Pasta side).  It was wonderful!  I'm glad to finally find a bbq place that does a rub rather than crappy, sugary bbq sauces.  The rub mix could use something to spice it up a bit, but the meat was perfectly cooked.... not slimy, fall off the bone and not chewy... perfect 'bite into it and easily pull off the bone' ribs.  The chicken was cooked just as good.  I'm normally not a fan of pasta, but this stuff was good, albeit not much chicken in it.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Embarrass to say that despite food poisoning to both my fiancé and I it was actually tasty.  Maybe some sort of cross contamination happened dealing with the chicken but wow it was pretty bad. It was less than 15 minutes after consuming the food. I was worst than my fiancé.  We ordered BBQ, chicken, baked beans, mac n cheese, mashed potatoes and a salad. We ate a little bit of everything except the salad so not sure exactly what it was.  We had food delivered on 6/26"}
{"text":"Surprised this isn't getting good reviews, the charocal style chicken is fantastic."}
{"text":"This place is great fresh chicken and ribs. They also have many sides to go along. Always clean and friendly staff. This place quicky became my favorite place to eat in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is a great place! We need a bay area chicken cafe!"}
{"text":"Love this place very good food! !!Nice to see this kind of place on South West side of las vegas"}
{"text":"I'm not really sure how I feel about Nevada Chicken Cafe. The food was a little on the bland side and I didn't feel the need to finish everything on my plate.  They have an extensive menu of sandwiches, rotisserie chicken, wraps, ribs and salads, but nothing stood out to me so I ended up with a Hawaiian wrap with fruit salad.  The chicken was ok, but not very plentiful or flavorful. All of my dining companions had the same lackluster response to the meal.   For the price, the meal didn't really live up to our expectations."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken and ribs. The prices are super cheap for the volume and quality. The wait time is minimal - order and counter & they bring it out. The sides (10 choices hot & cold) are fresh and taste homemade with something for everyone. Recommend the rib/ chicken combo, mash potatoes and side salads. Mother in law swears by the pulled chicken sandwiches. Had them cater for a work event and it was a huge hit!  When you leave not only will you feel full, and happy about the cost but you can eat super clean & healthy. Menu perfect for low carb, pales and those that are vegan. We travel across town 2-3 times a month to visit."}
{"text":"It looks kind of questionable from the outside, in a seedy strip mall on Sahara. But it's warm, friendly and clean on the inside. I ordered the chicken and ribs combo with roast potatos on the side, and my daughter got the BBQ chicken wrap with cole slaw. The emphasis here is on healthy choices that are tasty rather than tasteless. The rotisserie chicken was delicious and I don't even have to feel guilty.   We'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"The barbecue chicken is absolutely terrific and cooked to perfection.   With your meal includes many selections of sides such as mash potatoes, salads and pastas to name a few. Great atmosphere!"}
