{"text":"Unfortunately, this pub has declined in quality in a commercial village that shows a similar decline. The food, the service and the ambience all suffer from apparent ill-management. A favorite local restaurant has become one to avoid, unless you enjoy ambivalent service and less than average food. Unfortunately everything in Montelago Village seems to be declining in quality, as are their customers...."}
{"text":"Have been here a couple of times before and the service was not good.  Today the service was horrible.  Waited 15 minutes before I was acknowledged by our waiter and he just walked by and nodded and went into the kitchen.  He then came back with some tartar sauce for another table but stopped for about 4 minutes to watch the basketball game.  Then he delivered the tartar sauce to the other table and came back.  He asked if we were eating and then went to get us menus.  He came back 10 min later and asked us what we wanted to drink.  I told him we were also ready to order and he said wait a minute because he needed to get the drinks in.  Five more minutes later after he finished watching the end of the Gonzaga game in front of us he finally came back to take our order. Another server brought our food, She only brought 2 items but we ordered 3.  The appetizer never came.  She said it was back there and I told her to cancel it.  A few minutes later out original server came back out with the app.  I told him that I thought it would have come out first.  He said, \"dude, but you ordered it all together.\" REALLY FRUSTRATED NOW, I told him fine just leave it.  Food was only OK beer was good.  But the overall experience was not good.  They need to better train their waitstaff.  It is a cool little pub in a cool area."}
{"text":"Disappointing. We used to love eating here and at times would make a special trip to Lake Las Vegas just for their food.  The food prices increased and the portion sizes shrunk and not by a little bit. The nachos are now tiny and not worth the increase in price.  $16 for a small sized hamburger! Will not come back. Very sad."}
{"text":"Joey was Awesome!  Yes it's busy. And yes it's Hot! And, def 4th of July!  Being in the service industry  my daughter and, appreciate the running his b I try off he did. Thank you Joey great  job with all the matienence  peeps. We appreciated you . Thanks  again . Amanda dawn and scarlet"}
{"text":"On average there's about 5- 10 people there on Friday and Saturday nights. The musician is the best part of this place, in fact he's the ONLY good thing. The service is awful, the rude little bartender/owner Joe will argue with customers in order to defend anything they are upset about ie food or wrong drink. The manager and one main little waitress are also extremely rude. We live in the neighborhood so are very limited on nearby places to go, but it got so bad that we stopped going due the overall negative energy they create and the feeling that they actually hate their customers and their lives. Also, they are super overpriced! Your better off going anywhere but here."}
{"text":"Fantastic place with excellent atmosphere. Dual dart boards included as well as televisions everywhere with the games on. Wait staff was friendly and prompt. Joey was a fantastic server. 

We started with spicy potato balls. I had fish and chips and my wife had chicken boxty. Huge portion sizes and all dishes were very tasty. If you leave hungry, it's your own fault. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Service was great! Our server was attentive and very nice! The decor was great!!! Loved all the antiques ! I could have been there forever looking at all the trinkets. The food- my husband has the fish and chips. He loved it!!! He is a good eater and was satisfied with the half order. The portion is very generous! I had the corned beef tacos. I was a little iffy on trying it- but I love to try new things , plus our server high recommended them , WOW  they were sooooo good! Thinking about going back tonight!!! Have the fish and chips and the corned beef tacos!!! Don't forget the beer!"}
{"text":"The food is always good. We always order the corned beef tacos and the fish and chips! But seriously every time we try to go there as it is just down the street from our house, they are closed for some reason, this week they were closed for a deep cleaning? Wth! We've been probably 6 times and it was closed for some ridiculous reason... It can't be only us that runs into this problem, I'm curious how much business they are losing out on by doing this... If you want to run a business keep it open, 7 days a week."}
{"text":"From a fantastic selection of single malts & blends to outstanding fish & chips, this is not to be missed for anyone needing their pub fix.  There are far too few of these good Irish pubs off-strip.  I head down here whenever possible for a nice relaxing lunch.  I have thoroughly enjoyed everything I have ever ordered. A really nice drive there and back too, if you take Galleria."}
{"text":"Auld Dubliner Irish Pub

Picture this a Italian  village complete lakes, and waterfalls. This oasis in the middle of Nevada desert is a nice respit from the Chaotic Vegas strip. 

First this you will notice is the open air styling from the bar to outside patio

Second thing you will notice is the amount of wood in this place!  Hee hee \"amount of wood\" :O)

Third thing is selection of Single Malt Irish Whiskey, and bar taps..... hmmm whisky! 

Fare: The food is okay.  I had the \"Boxty\" if you have not had a \"Boxty\" it is great! This potato is flat and usually has a bunch of veggies, and some meats stuffed in this great fluffy, tasty cake... 

Price: Reasonable"}
{"text":"Good place for a drink, nice beer selection. Dinner was very sad. Potato leek soup was thin and lacked flavor. Bangers and mash was flavorless. Both items were cold. Hard to mess up sausage and mash but they did. Should of had the fish and chips they looked quite good. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Great menu and bar offering.  The staff was very frinedly and took good care of us.  Good choice if you are looking for a sports bar / restaurant in the Lake Las Vegas Area."}
{"text":"One of the only reasonably priced restaurants in Lake Las Vegas! Great food and drinks! Live music during the weekend!

I ordered the potato tacos (technically an appetizer, but large enough for a dinner) and it was DELICIOUS! The coleslaw and potato soup also got rave reviews from my table.

Fun atmosphere but the service was a bit slow (I only saw one waitress on duty while we were there)."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best burgers and fries in town great place to go in the village the guys there take care of everybody you can't beat it!!!"}
{"text":"Even though it's not \"on the strip\" I always stop here when I'm in Vegas! Well worth the trip into Lake Las Vegas, especially if you're a golfer... Very friendly staff, great food, and the Guinness is poured exactly as it should be. My only negative is that I have to fly 2500 miles to get here. So if you're looking for some good craic and a better pint, check it out here! Live music and a big patio for those wonderful Vegas nights are also big plusses!

Slainte!"}
{"text":"We had the same experience as one of the other reviewers.  Walked in, sat down and was ignored by the waitstaff.  Waited about 10-15 minutes before finally leaving.  There are better Irish restaurants in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going to this resturant since it opened. It sad to say that the service has slowly declined and the food prices have increased. It's unfortunate to think that the people that work there do not value you as a customer. I will never go back to this establishment and hope that the management make the staff and food changes soon. You just lost a loyal customer because you do not care about your patrons!"}
{"text":"Hit and miss. Have been here many times and have had some good nights and some bad ones. Food is good, albeit greasy, and decent beer menu. Won't change the tvs from nba so if you prefer anything else, go down the road."}
{"text":"After emailing my review to the owners of the Auld Dubliner, they responded very quickly and told me what action they had taken so that this doesn't happen to anyone else.  (Turns out the gal with a barefoot soaking in ice resting it on a bar stool wasn't an employee after all, so there wasn't anything they could do about that.)  They did, however, ask the manager and other staff on duty that day and found out exactly what happened with our order.  Apparently the waitress didn't put it in correctly so it never got back to the chef.  Rather than admit her mistake, she blew it off.  The owner assured me he had stern conversations with all concerned and is confident it won't happen again.

I was very impressed that one of the owners took the time to contact the restaurant to get all of the details, then took the time to reply back to me so quickly.  Apparently they really do take service very seriously, and my friends and I will be giving them another try after all."}
{"text":"Fish and chips were excellent, full portion was enough and then some. Amazing Tarter sauce! Good selection of beers and good service at the bar. Nice place, too bad they are in a commercial area that is struggling."}
{"text":"Turned up late but was still welcomed. Great Harp larger! Great ambience. Friendly staff. Can't wait to go back for Fish and Chips!"}
{"text":"I liked this place. We had two families, with kids, here for dinner one night. It is very casual and good for kids if you go earlier in the evening. There are a few flat screens around to catch games on as we ate as well.

As for the food, I liked it. I had the black n bleu burger with fries. It was very good and big. I suggest the fish n chips though. My wife had those and they were outstanding. I also ordered the Irish nachos with corned beef. I know, sounds weird. They were very good.

So, If you are in the Lake Las Vegas area and looking for some yummy comfort food in a casual atmosphere at a very fair price...look no further. This place is here waiting for you."}
{"text":"It's probably not the most authentic Irish pub I've ever been to. However, the decor and the views/setting are what keep me going back. The beer selection isn't bad either. Actually, the beer selection and the corned beef tacos are the best part of the dubliner.

The wait staff is okay. I never need to have an overly attentive staff though. I just want fresh food and made well. So, I will happily and utterly suggest the corned beef tacos and the corned beef and cabbage. Their other Irish favorites fare - that tends to be the most authentic - is pretty good. Even though it's more expensive, it's worth it.

I'll emphasize the beer selection again. It's the most Irish part of the pub. A good nitro is always my favorite, paired with Irish nachos as a meal."}
{"text":"We chose this \"pub\" based on the recommendations from our hotel on 5/20/16. The response when we asked one of the servers where we could sit was \"wherever\", just not on the patio because of a group reservation.  Once we found a table it continued to go downhill.  There were only two people to serve/bus tables to handle the packed place.  We started at 8:15 and finally got our food at 9:00.  We asked or server what was taking so long with the food and were given a shrug and a look of disgust.  The food was cold and it was pretty bad that it took over 45 minutes to get soup and salad.  To top it off the servers were rude and obnoxious when asked questions.  While it was very busy it was not an excuse for the conduct of the servers."}
{"text":"I like this place and will come back. Hopefully a different waitress. My shepherds pie was under cooked. She never checked on our table and when I remarked that it was no good she just took away without even Asking what was wrong. She apologized at the end but I am hungry as I have not eaten anything!
Corned beef sandwich looked good."}
{"text":"Awesome French fries, the fish part of the fish and chips was pretty good too. Great service - we had like the best waiter ever.  Only wish they opened even earlier in the day.

I give them five stars mainly because you could do far, far worse in a setting like this; but, they are good enough to warrant four stars in most any settingf."}
{"text":"Had a great time staying at Lake Las Vegas and this place was our go-to place for eats.  Excellent service and they serve Kilkenny on draft.  Just the Kilkenny is reason enough to go here.  But, there's more!  Hubby had the shep. pie...it was very good but the gravy was a bit thin.  I had the fish and chips (perfect) with a side of mashed with guinness and blue cheese gravy.  This gravy is some sort of magical sauce...I was seeing unicorns and butterflies as I ate it.   I would put that stuff on ice cream, in my coffee, or perhaps just drink it with a straw.  I highly suggest ordering the parm garlic fries with a side of this gravy for dipping."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to Lake Las Vegas several times. It is a nice area to get away from the crowds on the Strip and enjoy the beautiful village by the lake. Auld Dubliner is located right in the heart of the village next to the casino. 

We eaten here several times for lunch, but they have the same menu for lunch and dinner. 

We have tried the Corned Beef and Cabbage - some of the best we have ever had. Very tender beef with little fat and no gristle. A very good cream sauce is poured over it. $15 

Shepard's Pie - was very good and a good sized portion. However, I think \"McMullans\" Shepard's Pie is a little better. $14 

Fish Sandwich - Very good. The fish portion isn't as big as others I've had, but the flavor is wonderful and the side salad the comes with it is great. Not iceberg lettuce, but the spring mix greens with homemade dressing. $11 

Irish Quesadilla - weird but good. Has Irish bacon and cheese in the flour tortilla $10 

The prices are moderate and the location is beautiful. The only complaints for me is that they don't open until Noon. We usually eat lunch earlier and so we've had to wait a little while for them to open. The other complaint is that they are CLOSED ON TUESDAYS. The last time we went to Lake Las Vegas was, of course, on a Tuesday, and so we had to eat elsewhere. Other than that I would recommend them highly."}
{"text":"Was in town for a meeting for work   Very few choices but glad I picked this one  loved my meal Bangers   Friends seemed happy too with their meals   Waitress was great! And took care of us the whole time   Even called the shuttle for us   Would recommend to friends"}
{"text":"Nice little Irish pub atmosphere and a friendly staff. Service was prompt. Had the bbc burger and garlic parm fries. Burger was delicious and cooked at a perfect medium rare. I'd save your $2 up charge on the fries, and actually skip the fries altogether. Unless of course you like bland steak fries, despite the promise of garlic parm goodness. All in all, a solid Irish that pours a nice Guinness."}
{"text":"Whitney is a great server and one of the very rare smiles in the Dubliner.

Having a bar serving Spaten Optimator so close to home is dangerous.

I was never a fan of Irish food. I lived in downtown HB most of my life and in the 90s there was a surge of Irish bars opening up there, which were never really known for their food.

Well, my opinion has changed. The Auld Dubliner has the best hamburgers in Vegas. Oh wait hamburgers aren't Irish...  Well Auld Dubliner has a little of everything on their menu, from Shepherds Pie, potato leek soup (yum) to fresh corn beef and seared Ahi tuna salad.

Of course the Potato Leek soup and the blue cheese burger is my favorite. And make sure you order it with french fries, which comes seasoned with curry.

On the weekends the Auld Dubliner has some great local bands and there is always a crowd in there dancing.

It the Spring or Summer the patio has some great atmosphere for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"We are locals and have never had a bad meal here. Last night the burger was excellent (homemade) and fish and chips (with curry fries) was awesome as well. For the first time ever, we opted for desert (creme brule, house made) and it was one of the best I have ever had outside our own kitchen. Smooth, creamy, made with real vanilla bean. Service was excellent and it usually is even when the place is hopping. If you are not from here, I would recommend Dubliner over the new Brooklyns (see my review from a couple weeks ago - okay food, very slow service) for either lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Burgers were good said my dad and husband. Pulled pork sandwich was enough for my mom and I to share, it was good the only thing I would recommend is getting the purple coleslaw on the side"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with this little gem in Lake Las Vegas! Great decor, great beer selection, very good appetizer foods (check out the Curry Chips, and spicy potatoes). We didn't eat from the full menu so I can't comment, but for what we did try, I imagine the other menu items are excellent. I really enjoyed the quaint, relaxed, friendly atmosphere! 

I really wish we could transport this place into the city, it's really unfortunate that LLV is not bringing in the clientele to provide this venue with a good supply of customers. 

Definitely hit up this pub when you are in Lake Las Vegas. It was the most fun we had on our visit!"}
{"text":"Quite a few Irish Pubs have sprung up in the West Valley; one by the Peoria Spots Complex, The Auld Dubliner, and most recently one at West Gate. I have been to each spot and I have frequented TAD many more times. I like the atmos at TAD however I question the rusty farm tools and nets hanging on the walls. After coming here for a few happy hours over the last few months, and taking advantage of the special pricing, happy hour is a good time to come. Some of the happy hour specials are $1 off draft beers, half priced appetizers, and extended lunch menu definitely makes this time of day a better value. TAD has a selection of about 12 draft brews including one of my favorites Smithwick's. On one visit I tried the Fish N Chips which are pretty standard and tasty. 

**Bargain hunter alert ** Tied into the happy hour, TAD offers lunch portions until 6 pm -- smaller portion and more cost effective.

The Auld Dubliner is a solid spot for happy hour."}
{"text":"My husband and I met up with a friend at the pub on a Sunday late afternoon (4ish).  It was fairly empty at the time.  The decor is quite nice, the place seems airy and open and overall the service was excellent.  
We were mostly there to chat over pints, but sampled a handful of the appetizers.  The hush puppies were awesome and I would highly recommend them.  I don't tend to spicy things, but I understand that the jalapeno jelly was excellent.  A quick bit of spice with the sweetness of jelly.  We also tried the pork rolls which were crispy on the outside and tender and delicious on the inside.  The potato boats (or skins or whatever they call them), were well executed as well.
Since we were there for a few hours, we decided to order the chicken boxty, which was excellent as well.  The potato was cooked just right, the chicken was tender and juicy and the white sauce was to die for.  It also came with a side of steamed veggies that was well cooked (not mushy, not too crisp).
I would certainly visit again.  And try the hush puppies.  Trust me."}
{"text":"Never before have I had like, three courses of items that had corned beef in them. Good thing I love corned beef. We had the corned beef nachos, the sandwich, the potato leek soup, and several other items I can't remember including two wonderful desserts. The layout is really cool and we passed the time after ordering our food by looking around at all the pieces on the walls. The food was wonderful, the service was a bit slow and confused, and the restaurant is really interesting. Does not feel right stepping back out into the Las Vegas heat after that neat little meal."}
{"text":"What a great Little Irish pub!  If your near Lake Las Vegas get over here!  Good menu and great service!  Prices are decent and there is a huge beer selection!  Cozy!"}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan...it's a nice little irish place in the village...and I know it's a chain, but this one feels different because it's so much smaller than the ones elsewhere.  kick back, play some darts...listen to some Irish tunes...have a few beers...it just doesn't get much better than that!  Oh, and the food is okay, nothing too memorable, but it doesn't detract from the experience...try the banger corn dog or the wings"}
{"text":"Awesome place!!!! Great food and drinks. Staff is awesome! I try to go there at least once a week! Never had a problem there."}
{"text":"I love this pub! It's my favorite in Las Vegas and their food is amazing; I just had the Bushmill's chicken boxti and it was out of this world!! And the Guinness is the best in town too!"}
{"text":"I'm in Lake Las Vegas once a year so I trusted the opinions of my friends in coming to the \"Irish place\". Auld Dubliner was HOPPING when we arrived. I literally snatched our table from a family getting up to go, their old plates still on the table.... 

The wait for our food was average, but it was all worth it to me for one reason: potato leek soup. I wish I had ordered only soup and kept it coming.

At my table, the boxty was getting the chatter. I also saw an interesting Guinness stew pass by. I sampled the boxty (described as shepherd's pie wrapped up in a plate-sized potato pancake). Fantastic. I had ordered the pulled pork sandwich because I wasn't feeling experimental and it was only $9 without an upcharge for the soup. The sandwich was average. The soup was glorious. It's like warm, creamy, smooth, savory, rich velvet--in a bowl. After one bite, it's all I wanted. My man and I were hooked. I ordered an additional bowl from the busboy for $4. 

TV's abound so I caught Oregon's demolition of Stanford. It's really noisy and everything resonates because the place is just hard wood all around, so expect an overgrown sports pub sort of feel. If you take your kids, you'd be best to sit at a table outside. It was hard for us to grab our server at times (like I said, I ordered at one time from the busboy...) but they were hopping, after all.

I would come here for specific treasures on the menu. It seems like a great place to catch the game. I'd have a beer and potato leek soup...in a ratio of 1 to 3."}
{"text":"Great place to stop for a pint of Carlsberg and to catch the world cup whilst escaping the afternoon heat. Friendly clean and a good crowd."}
{"text":"After having overly salty soup and lousy service at the Sonrisa Grill, my friend and I decided to come here for a drink/and a bite to eat during happy hour. I ordered a vodka tonic and she a vodka and soda. When she received her drink, there was no carbonation and she asked if she could give her something else and my friend requested diet coke, which was also flat. When she asked if there were problems with the co2 tank, she said, that's just how it is. 

After our bad experience at the Sonrisa Grill and her response to my friend, we decided to cut our losses, go back to our time share and eat/drink what we had brought. I paid for my drink and understandably, my friend chose to not as she did not drink it. When we left the waitress called over the railing, \"hey, can you guys pay for the other drink?\" and my friend said absolutely NOT. The nerve. We ended up going back to the condo, making our own food and drinks and relaxing. If this resort wants to make it, then I highly recommend that these restaurants get it together. Mind you, we are go with the flow customers who tip well and the only good experience we had was that morning in Henry's where we had a wonderful Bloody Mary and a gracious breakfast server. I hope that the one in my home town of Tustin does not suck like this one."}
{"text":"This place is fun and the staff at least from my experience were great.. The design of the pub is unique and is definitely designed for a social experience.  The lunch here is good the dinner is forgettable but this place is a pub and you need to expect that. The beer selection is great and that alone is a winner for me."}
{"text":"We made a trip to the Auld Dubliner after the movies a couple of weeks ago.  We arrived about 10 pm and the place was crowded.  They had a live band and it was so loud that I couldnt hear anything!  We sat down and ordered drinks and waited about ten minutes for them.  After that we ordered off the limited late menu and I had the Corned Beef Sandwich and it was one of the worst meals I have ever had.  The texture and flavor were horrible.  My wife had wings and was not impressed.  The prices were very high for what you received. 

 We will not be making a return trip here."}
{"text":"Come not expecting gourmet food and you will be completely satisfied with their comfort food.

My family (hubby & 2 kids--6, 8 yo) and friends had a wonderful dinner while enjoying live entertainment on a Friday evening. We sat in the \"game room\" with the adults on one table and kids on another. 
There were plenty of games to keep the kids entertained.  They especially loved the dart game.

Our server was very attentive and did not lack the service as others have noted in other reviews. Our pub food was very good. We enjoyed the Reuben sandwich, Guiness meatloaf, hamburger --forgot the name, and chicken tenders. All entrees were satisfactory. Served hot as expected!!!
We avoided the fish and chip since it didn't have good reviews from other yelpers.

Come with the right expectation and you won't be disappointmented.

I highly recommend the Auld Dubliner if you are staying at the nearby hotels...as it is an excellent choice for dining but don't drive out of your way."}
{"text":"We made the trip to The Auld Dubliner on a Saturday late afternoon to have some drinks and a snack before the hockey game.  We were all hungry and everything on the menu sounded delicious.  First off drinks . . . Guinness please!  As they say, \"when in rome,\" or in this case \"when in an Irish Pub.\"

Now time to decide on food.  So many choices!  I ended up going with a grilled veggie sandwich called Ploughman's Sandwich.  My friend got the Chicken Pesto Sandwich and the boys both got a boxty; Shepards Pie and Cornned Beef.  Right as the server was leaving, we added an order of the Spicy Potatoes, I had to try them!

While we were waiting to get our food, which didn't take too long, there was plenty of fun stuff on the walls to keep us busy; for our first visit anyway.  When the Spicy Potatoes arrived, we couldn't wait to jump in.  Small, new potatoes, fried and tossed in wing sauce, sprinkled with blue cheese crumbles and served with ranch.  These were by far the star of the meal!  The Dubliner had a perfectly tangy wing sauce that I wanted to put on everything!

Once we finished those off, which did not take long at all, our food arrived and we were all pleased with that as well.  On my veggie sandwich, the ciabata was perfect; very soft, which isn't always the case with ciabata.  The sandwich was great, and also helped to clear my sinuses with all of the horseradish.  I love horseradish, however if you don't, I would suggest asking for it without the sauce.  

The boxtys were good sized, not too big which is a plus when none of us wanted to get tired, we had a hockey game to go to!  They were served almost like a crepe, folded in quarters, with the filling oozing out of the side and scattered on top.  Very tasty!!

I can't wait to attend another sporting event in Glendale so I have a reason to return to The Auld Dubliner."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the draw here is. I would certainly never go out of my way to come here. However, if you happen to already be at Lake Las Vegas for another reason, it's a decent place to stop for a drink and a bite to eat.

It's your standard Irish pub. Nothing new, different, or noteworthy. 

The food is decent, but nothing great. Pretty standard Irish pub fare.

In the warmer months, the patio, which wraps around the front is very nice. They have misters in the summer and heaters in the winter. I also like that they allow dogs on the patio, which is a huge plus for us as we rarely are at Lake Las Vegas without our dog in tow.

During the different festivals and whatnot that happen at Lake Las Vegas (such as the beer fest), they usually have a booth out in front that serves food and beer. The hot dogs they usually serve are excellent! I wish they were on the menu."}
{"text":"I don't like to give 5 stars for reviews, because I like the restaurant the way it is and don't want it to get over crowded.   But the Auld dubliner deserves it.

We went there expecting so so fare, and were shocked that even the ribs were delicious.   Fish and chips are amazing and delicious,  bangers and mash are also amazing.   The pull pork sandwich is a pass, not so great.   Lake Las Vegas is as beautiful as ever and so quiet and peaceful."}
{"text":"Great garden burgers! It's easy and a comfortable  atmosphere! If you live in lake Las Vegas great place to go to watch football on a Sunday!"}
{"text":"Food here is great!. Best bloody mary in town.. Service was awesome. Ask for Nichole!"}
{"text":"This is the only Irish bar I've frequented in the area and it is about the only good bar in Lake Las Vegas that isn't a hotel bar.  Definitely a made for tourists spot with over the top Irish decor but the food and drink are good.  It seems to be one of the few busy things in this fairytale ghostland of a make believe village/shopping area."}
{"text":"This pub has a very relaxed atmosphere. 
I went here with my two young children, and it's nice that you can choose your own seating, I was able to get a table where my kids weren't in any danger of bothering others.

I had the Guinness Beef Stew, which was good. Nothing spectacular, but if you like beef stew, it's up to par.

Only complaints are that despite the light crowd, our server still forgot to bring us utensils till after the food was served, our toddlers food came out 5 - 10 minutes after all the adults food (most kitchens know to serve the kids food first), and the french fries were luke warm when they came out... didn't seem fresh.

The decor is very standard for an Irish Pub, and, although we didn't sit in it, the wrap around patio looks like a great place to eat during warmer weather."}
{"text":"I had a coupon for a buy one get one free meal, so of course we had to check it out. The staff was friendly but the building was small. The beer was good and the food okay. The entertainment was setting up as we set off to see a movie at the theater down the way. I am going to give it another try. If you sign up online, they send you coupons for free meals and money off your bill."}
{"text":"To get away from the hustle and bustle of the busy city, whenever we go to Las Vegas, we stay at the Viera at the Lake Las Vegas Village more often than not.  The village where the pub is located is very quaint and has some great shops and restaurants. It's also right next to the Montelago Casino which makes it a convenient place to eat after some gambling.

Our room overlooks the village and we always hear the sounds of a live band travelling up to our room from Auld Dubliner so this time, we decided to give it a try since it was a nice night out.

The place was pretty open for a pub actually.  The bar was relatively busy but the indoor and outdoor seating areas were roomy for the most part.  We sat indoors but if you choose to sit outside, it's really cool, especially when the weather is nice, you can see  with the string of lights hanging above the village and can feel the breezy air coming from the lake just a few steps away from the pub.  

One of my favorite things about the restaurant is the live band they had performing there.  It was a Saturday night and \"JV Allstars\" were performing. I think they're a local band, I'm not sure.... but they were very very good and added to the atmosphere there. The singer/guitarist and his drummer were able to play many songs by request. 

For food, we ordered the Irish Sausage Roll as the appetizer. I ordered the Rasher & Cheese Boxty and the boyfriend ordered the Shepherd's Pie.  The Sausage Roll was very good.  The sausage is chopped up and rolled in a pastry dough that comes out really flaky. It was gooood.  I've never had a \"Boxty\" before so I didn't know what to expect but it turned out to be very tasty.  It's like a potato cake/pancake that's crispy and had ham and cheese melted on top. They have other types of boxtys on their menu.  Tried a little bit of the Shepherd's Pie. There's mashed potatoes on top and what seemed to be a beef/vegetable stew on the bottom. I believe it was baked.  

For dessert, we had their Irish whiskey creme brulee, which was good but had too much whiskey in it for my taste. A little bit less would have been delicious but I mostly tasted the whiskey. Perfect for anyone who loves whiskey though!  We enjoyed the food there and will come back to taste the rest of the menu!

I would have sat there eating/drinking all night if I could =)"}
{"text":"Late night drinks with Joe! He knows how to make a bloody beer he won our heart! They had a live band too pretty fun.  We took the shuttle from Lowes as it was so not hoppin there but we went to relax but wanted to check out the village.  Our driver said we should have stayed at Lowes unless we just wanted to get food at the village boy am I glad I didn't listen! We had a great time.  Drinks were a little pricey but I guess since it's either there or the resort it wasn't so bad.  I will visit again when I go to Lowes."}
{"text":"I liked this place.  It was totally cool you could go and play the Wii or Battleship in the next room.  I thought that was awesome. Keeps the kids away from tripping all over my table.

Met up with friends one night... had a couple of super strong beers, it seems.  I like Guiness with Blue Moon (a black and blue) and this one seemed to hit me harder where even on just 2 of them I was like \"Whoa I gotta stop\".

For the dinner... I had those folded thingies like the one in the picture... for the life of me, I cannot remember what they are called.  Mine had the corned beef and cabbage... It got rich quick... I couldn't even eat a quarter of it.  A friend had a salmon one that wasn't so rich, but tasted awesome. Another had the fish and chips, which I usually never try but tried there, and they were good.  So good that I went to another bar in Surprise and was pretty disappointed with their fish and chips.

The music is fun... the people are easy. 

I will definitely suggest going back."}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure what I was expecting from an Irish pub in a shopping center. First, the food

We ordered two chicken club sandwiches. They brought two bbq chicken sandwiches. The waitress was pleasant and admitted to the mistake. But I was starving and was half way through the sandwich and realized it was unlikely anything would be better so I kept it.

The chicken was dry and rubbery. The chicken completely lacked in flavor. The kitchen is probably accustomed to this observation and tried to cover it by dipping it in bbq sauce and probably maple syrup. Pretty awful. 

My girlfriend ordered the chicken club which was also sub par. 

Neither of us were sick at the end of the meal. 

The beer selection is good. It has a nice patio with a man who plays the bagpipes intermittently throughout the day.  It's at a reasonable volume outside. Inside it is deafening. 

Bottom line:  I would get a drink here again and sit on the patio. I would not recommend ordering the chicken."}
{"text":"What a fun place this is!  Great food and rocking and fun bands on the weekend!   I was staying @ the Viera condos in Montelago Village at  Lake Las Vegas and it was an easy crawl back to the hotel/condo. 

Lake Las Vegas/Montelago Village is a great relaxing place as well.  Close to the strip for dinner and show and then back to the quiet and tranqility of the european themed village. 

Go check out Lake Las Vegas!  There is  a great buzz going on out there..  Great food and great views!"}
{"text":"Sitting at this restaurant right now, been here 45 minutes and my drink has been empty the majority of that time. Have not been able to get a refill or my food yet. However other people that sat down after me are currently eating or done eating. Hope the food is good, but will NOT return based on service alone."}
{"text":"Awesome music on Fri amd sat.nigjt. a fun energy in the pub .rhere wine is.perfectly chilled and delicious cornbeef."}
{"text":"5 stars...this place is amazing in a lot of ways... The location of this place is nestled in one of the most gorgeous communities Las Vegas and Henderson has to offer.... Lake Las Vegas...The ambience is amazing...kind of set up like an old-school Irish pub you must go see to appreciate and Believe me you'll appreciate it...great service and food...who ever the chiefs are here need there own cooking show...My Favorite is there Veggie burger...everyone that I had taste it...was like OMG this is soooo fu$&ing good...JUST GO!"}
{"text":"The Auld Dubliner is a quaint little pub at the beautiful Montelago Village.  The food and drinks are very comparable to Fado's in Henderson.  I'm not sure how well its going to fair with the closing of the casinos but I sure hope they find a place in the city if they can't make it out there being the Pub is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Hidden away among the slowly decaying businesses of Lake Las Vegas and far, far away from any parking, the Auld Dubliner is still one of the best Irish pubs in town.  Pretty much because the bar understands that a pub should be low key and classic.  In Ireland, a pub is just a run of the mill watering hole.  But by the time they migrate over to the states, many of them become extravagant or showy places in an attempt to seem more European.  

Not the Auld Dubliner.  The place is classic.  While the establishment is fairly new, it feels like a place where the wood on the bar has been worn down from a hundred years of spilled beer.  The bar's selection of Irish whiskeys is solid.  Not the widest selection in town, but a long enough collection that it will take you awhile to drink through the menu.  On top of that, the place has a superb beer selection.  One of my favorite Irish beers (Kilkenny) is almost impossible to find in the western U.S. and they have it on tap.  If for no other reason, the bar is praiseworthy for its well chosen stock of spirits and beer.   

But they also serve up a solid pub menu.  When we went, we had deep fried chips with curry (yum) and a couple of solid cheese burgers topped with Irish cheddar cheese.  The night we were there they had a solo guitar act playing and he did a pretty solid job with a library of Irish rock and soul ballads.

I hope that Lake Las Vegas figures out how to survive because the Auld Dubliner is a fine place to bring a group for drinks."}
{"text":"my wife and i went to this pub shortly after they opened last summer.  we got there about 15 minutes before opening time.  it was 115 degrees outside.  we tried to go in and the manager told us we had to wait outside until they opened.  it was 115 degrees!! are you kidding me??
we left and went to the sonrisa grill instead.

would never go back.  horrible customer service and mean spirited management!"}
{"text":"Cozy pub. Nice size food portions with great beer and wiskey selection. Fun and friendly staff. NFL Sunday ticket makes it the place to be for football with a sports book a quick walk next door."}
{"text":"Ok....my 2nd review of an \"Irish\" pub.  And we're getting closer.  Good ambiance - I really thought it looked much like a few pubs I visited in Dublin (tho no pictures, that I saw, of the famous revolutionaries, no flags, no old photographs.  But a good draft beer selection.  And a really good Irish menu - we had the fish sandwich and the banger sandwich (lunch menu) which included chips (french fries) and I ordered a side of curry dip for the chips.  Good stuff.
Good Irish music (cd's) playing in the background - not obtrusive.  And a very good wait staff.  The bartender greeted us the minute we walked in. But sorry, folks, music is Thurs thru Sat and no Irish music that they admitted to - cover bands instead.  So I'll keep looking, but I'll stop here when I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"fish and chips ........ plain jane prob the best place to drink  in the little shopping center of lake las vegas but def not worth it .. in fact skip lake las vegas all together ."}
{"text":"Try the curry chips.  They are the best I've had & try them at every Irish Pub I go to.

The beer is tasty & if it's not too hot outside, the patio is great."}
{"text":"Such a BEAUTIFUL GET AWAY from the commercialized Las Vegas. You forget that you're still in Vegas when you go here. There is LOTS of cool eateries and shops around it. I had my first Traditional Irish Food which was a Beef Stew Boxsty (spelling?) it was interesting but GOOD. I think because it looked like a pancake filled with my stew. I RECOMMEND IT!"}
{"text":"The fish and chips are delish, small place but very cozy and the live music was great!! I'm definitely coming back. I love the vibe and the staff is really friendly."}
{"text":"Beware the menu online is for the Long Beach location. This one is NOTHING like it. 

The food was your typical bar food fare with a few Irish options. It's super overpriced and the wait staff seems to be in a hurry all the time, even when it was slow. They weren't rude but not friendly either.

If you aren't staying in Lake Las Vegas or familiar with the place, it can be extremely frustrating to find. You have to park in the garage next to the closed casino and go down to the outdoor business section (most of the businesses are empty). Find a directory down there to guide you the rest of the way. Or just don't go and find somewhere better."}
{"text":"I expected better food.... 

I met up with 5 other friends for some grub and some drinks. I had the Corn Beef with Cabbage and it so so freaking boring I needed to add the spicy Mustard to give it a little flavor. 
Friend 1 had burger...dry and tasteless 
Friend 2 had Turkey burger....bland and boring 
#3 had corn beef taco's boring and tasteless ....a taco tasteless????? 
#4 had a burger...same 
#5 had fish and frys...the fish was good the frys were cold 

The drinks were good, but I is not hard to make Captain and Coke, Stoli and Coke, Jack and Coke, some fruity drink and a beer. 

I wish it was better...."}
{"text":"Service at best was ok, food did not do enough to over come poor service. Seemed to be a \"new priced menu\" for an event going on. I would go back, but things need to tighten up."}
{"text":"This place is way out of Las Vegas. It is in Henderson. Apparently Henderson is bigger than I thought. Located on Lake Las Vegas. About 1/3 of the businesses are closed including the Casino. I asked Joe the bartender about the casino and when it closed. He was dodging my questions saying it is reopening under new management. He was not very polite. I ordered the Sheppard's Pie which was bad. He asked me if I ever tried Sheppard's Pie before and I must not like lamb. I told him I lived in England for a year and have tried Sheppard's Pie hundreds of times and I do like lamb. I ended up getting the French dip sandwich which was OK. The Sausage Rolls were OK. The decor is nice."}
{"text":"... Ended up at this pub to kill some time, while waiting for a friend at lake Las Vegas..  Ended up closing the place down.   Jared the bartender is super knowledgable on beers, and gave me the best suggestions for the menu. Joey is super awesome as well, and he's got a wicked sense of humor..,, the pastrami sandwich is heaven!  If you come to lake Las Vegas, this spot is a must...."}
{"text":"The wife and I ventured out of our comfort zone when we decided to come here for dinner. It was about 8:30 pm on Friday night and the place was hopping. They were clearing out some tables for a band to set up for a live set. Cool But we didn't stay late enough to see the band. 

We both started with a draft of Smithwicks and then on with the main courses. I got the corn beef cabbage (my second time in my life) it came with whole small red potatoes, carrots, a wedge of cabbage and a pile of thin sliced corn beef cover with a white sauce of some sorts. It was good. :) I am liking this corn beef cabbage thing. 

My wife got the beef stew with potatoes. The portion was huge, and she did her best to put a dent in it. I helped her along with it a bit. :) It was tasty but could have used a little more flavor without added salt. 

We both like our meals and it came out fast (about 10 min) We had a good time but didn't stay long since the wife was tired."}
{"text":"Even before my wife and I had moved to Lake Las Vegas, we visited this establishment and enjoyed their selection of food and drink. The staff is awesome, especially Reneé. She is funny, cool, attentive, and honest! She didn't steer us wrong. 

Since moving to the area several months ago, we've been there a couple of times more and each time the food quality, taste, and Reneé's recommend drink concoctions were on-the-money! 

Reneé, we will visit there and see you more often. I promise! 

By the way, the Fish N Chips are huge and extra crunchy! The way they should be! The burgers are super tasty and so are their fries!"}
{"text":"After a filling dinner at Luna Rossa, we decided to have a few drinks at this quaint pub. I'm glad we did. 

The place was pretty busy inside, makes sense since it was the only place still open at The village. We immediately were helped by Joey as we ordered Bloody Marys . The ambiance was definitely of an Irish pub and to our luck, there was Hal Savar, aka the human jukebox taking in song requests. Great singer and definitely got the party started. 
I only have the Bloody Mary to review so here it goes: 
I love spicy bloody Mary's and this drink was no exception! It was really spicy and I loved it!!! They make their own mix, so it was quite interesting. At first I enjoyed it because the flavors were bold, almost like a celery, pepper, olive purée. The only thing I didn't like about it was that it was a bit too sweet for my liking. It was ok, but I have to be in the mood for it. The spice factor made it enjoyable for me. 
We had no food items, so can't rate in regards to. 
All in all, the auld dubliner is a fun place to listen to live music, watch people lose at darts and make a fool of themselves as they drunk dance! But then again, that's what makes any place enjoyable. Next time I'm in the area, I'll be coming back to this little pub and try some food!"}
{"text":"How many nights have a sat on one of their bar stools spending my paycheck? More often than I'd like to admit. From their illegally imported bottles of Paddy to the perfect pour of my Guinness...there were more memories forgotten than remembered. 
So, you might ask, why the negative review? Poor service, bad attitude, etc. The problem with this Auld Dubliner is that it is the anchor of a dying resort area. This shelters them from actually having to compete for business. Over the years, plenty of time shares have been sold to this declining area. While most are content to venture to the Strip, a number of regulars confine themselves to the manmade monstrosity known as Lake Las Vegas. I have always pulled for the ol' girl as it was somewhat fun when it was thriving. Now she's as a sad as a truck stop escort. 
This last time, we stopped in at 11:10 on a Sunday. Being our anniversary (17 years), we wanted to do something special. We had our little ones in tow in addition to invited friends with their children. Based on their current menu, this would easily be a $150 bill. Waiter stops us at the door & tells us they don't serve lunch until 11:30, but we could sit at the bar. Mind you, there's four adults & four children under the age of 4...the bar? After a beat, he seats us at a 'reserved' table. The high chairs provided were one step above toxic waste. Being parents of toddlers, we're used to some nastiness on the high chairs, but I think someone had actually puked on the top one as the waiter took it away to clean it. True to his word, the waiter waited until 11:30 to provide us with menus. He mentioned kid menus which we then requested, but were never delivered. When questioned as to the menu in our hands versus the one posted online (and the 30% mark up), he just mumbled something about it being another location's menu & that the one in front of us was \"our menu\". Really not all that customer service orientated. 
Having eaten here multiple times before, the food is solid. Not the best I've ever had nor the worst. Unfortunately, we never made it to the actual eating portion of lunch as a larger party walked in. We felt the attention of our server shift to the easier all drinks party as we went from being the first group in the restaurant to a nuisance. Maybe it was a ploy to get us to leave as the mere thought of cleaning up after four toddlers wasn't enough to justify the $30 tip or more he was going to receive. Maybe this isn't fair to the Auld Dubliner, but from being a patron who has spent $15/shot for Paddy, who has purchased a bottle of Jameson on more than one occasion, who has had food/drink bills over $200...for two people, I feel like I am more qualified than most to either recommend or condemn. 
The kicker was having to walk away from a perfectly poured Guinness..."}
{"text":"Awesome service and very friendly staff. They are in an area that looks deserted, but right by the lake and if the casino comes back this place will be absolutely amazing. As for the food i had the fish sandwich and an order of soda bread. Soda bread was great, but as it was soda bread it was just kind of soda bread. The fish sandwich for the price was much more than enough and was delicious. I would go here any chance i got to just hang out and drink eat a little, sadly a little bit of a drive from the strip where i am staying."}
{"text":"Great Irish food and beer. I had the meatloaf with blue cheese gravy and my wife had the corn beef and cabbage. Both were excellent and large portions. Located in a quaint mini village of shops. Free parking in Marriott ramp seems to be the trick, then use walkway on 3rd level to courtyard."}
{"text":"I have been to this place over 10 times...  I am sad to say the food is getting worst and worst...  What gives?  Each time we go, I hope it gets better.  Nope...  The service has gotten worst too.  Hum, I might not return again...  But my husband loves the place..."}
{"text":"Nasty food. The food is over priced and not many customers. The ice tea is awful. The beers are ok, but walk across the way to the sonrisa grill and the drinks and food are half the price. The Irish theme is nice but the atmosphere is not a true Irish pub."}
{"text":"Pretty typical Irish pub with a nice little outdoor seating area and there was a good live band on Friday night. Overall, there arent too many options when at Lake Las Vegas, and this place seemed to be the busiest place down there. The whole Montelago village is a nice area to wander around in, and If I'm down there again, I'll stop back in.

Ok, I'll be honest...I cant remember this place very well...too much whiskey...but I think what I wrote is accurate. And obviously I had a good time."}
{"text":"Not your typical pub grub! This place adds a nice culinary twist to your typical Irish dish or pub fav's. You'll never leave hungry with their large portions! 
The service is great, and the beer is always cold! They have an amazing selection of craft beers on tap that change once in a while so you always have a new treat. 
I recommend any of the burgers, especially the veggie! The boxy is to die for as well as the ahi tuna tacos! Of course you can never go wrong with the shepherds pie! Let's talk wings... These are a meal them-self! They are huge and so so good! 
If you're in Las Vegas, take a night away from the strip, and check out lake Las Vegas cause this place is a must! 
Check them out on a Friday or Sat. Night for live music! 
Great job everyone who works there! You rock!"}
{"text":"What a great  casual place to enjoy in Lake Las Vegas.  If you are here already for a stay-cation, its worth it.  Its pretty typical pub, but it does not reek of smoke or have nasty bar food.   I had a delicious soup and fish and chips and loved the singer that was performing last Friday night.  The beer selection was not amazing and a little pricey, but that's my only negative reflection.  Good way to end the evening."}
{"text":"Pretty decent food and service. The staff did seem bored, probably because there were three of them and two customers. They were out of the roast beef sandwich we had wanted, so we had to substitute for the Ruben, which was not a bad choice. I don't recommend the Caesar salad, however--not a very flavorful dressing. I will be back--it seems like a great place to spend St Patrick's Day!"}
{"text":"The Auld Dubliner is a welcome change in the chanification that is the West Valley.  They do have a few other locations (one in Tucson, another in Colorado) but this place doesn't have that chain style feel.  The menu claims that the interior was imported from Ireland and that the inside setup is authentic to Ireland.  I've never been so I can't speak to that, but the interior is eclectic and fun.

The people that work at the Dubliner were friendly.  Full disclosure, I went here to see a friend who works there as a server and had her schedule time wrong.  The staff was super friendly and still got us what we needed, knowing full well that she would be getting any tips from our table.  

They have an 'early bird special which gives you an option of the Irish fare in smaller portions for a smaller price.  You get a choice of soup or salad and a small dessert with this option, all for $9.95.  A pretty decent deal for all the food you get.

I had the fish and chips early bird special, pretty much the only thing that sounded half appetizing to me.  Irish food is typically quite meaty, so options are always limited at such institutions for me.  They also have Hooegarden on tap which pushed them to the four star rating for me."}
{"text":"First of all I have been to this place a lot! Love the staff, love to see wedding parties and love that people are supporting the Lake Las Vegas area! Usually the music is very good a guy Tim Catching is exceptional and he usually has a guy on drums or more people with him.  Lately they have had a real downer singer with a good voice but awful schtick/jokes and sings nothing but downer songs.  He is Filipino and I like his name is Arron or Arrow. He is with another guy and he smokes non stop when he isn't singing.  I don't stay long when this guy is there but otherwise I love this place!"}
{"text":"I had low expectations for the Irish pub, being that it's in the middle of a basically desolate shopping center in Lake Las Vegas--but I was surprised. 

The service was excellent, the two folks who helped us out were attentive and nice. Other servers made sure to check on us as well, just to make sure we were doing okay.

The fish sandwich, Reuben, and buffalo parm chicken fingers were all tasty (Beware: their fries have curry on them. Delicious but unexpected.) I'd avoid the parmesan fries, not worth the $2 upcharge.

Beer seems a little bit pricy and the happy hour isn't really anything to brag about, but I'd place this pub in the \"more than decent\" category. Granted, it kind of has to be given there isn't much choice if you're in the area."}
{"text":"The original #wvfn meetup spot! Great spot just off the 101 for cold brew! Bring 4 friends and order Irish Car Bombs! They have a great \"slapper\" for the experience. Still waiting for the video (hint @clintus)"}
{"text":"We had a taste for pub food and atmosphere while in Lake Las Vegas and found The Auld Dubliner here on Yelp.

There were not too many people inside when we arrives so there was no problem seating the 9 of us.  Great beer list, I had a saison and an IPA during the course of the meal.  Over the course of time the place got packed and there was only one waitress (Renee I believe, apologies if I spelled it wrong) and she did a phenomenal job.  I'm not sure if the staffing was planned or unplanned but she deserves a medal.

I particularly liked the twists put on pub type food with an 'Irish' flair.  'Nachos' made with potato chips and corned beef etc.  I had the potato leek soup and a small Cesar salad.  I particularly enjoyed the fact that the salad was not over dressed.  The soup came with relatively large chunks of potato  and was not blended as some are, there were plenty of recognizable leeks present and had great flavor.

I'd definitely return here if ever in the area again."}
{"text":"Overall I enjoy Auld Dubliner. We've ate her a handful of times. Usually I eat the fish & chips which never fails to disappoint. Last time I ate corned beef tacos, it was a different twist on tacos. But, worth the difference! I enjoyed the meal. Just wished it didn't have so much lettuce. I gave this restaurant three stars because I believe it should have more Irish food options mostly cafe food. Service was good and at night they have an enjoyable fun live band."}
{"text":"We ate here a week ago.  What stood out most for us about this restaurant compared with most anything in Vegas or Henderson is that it's open air and you can sit outside on a patio that overlooks the attractive pedstrian-only 'village' area of the Lake Las Vegas instead of the usual parking lot or a busy street.  Definitely nice ambiance in that respect.  [We would have preferred there be no smoking allowed outside, however.  We had to move tables to get away from a smoker.]

As for the service, our waiter was very good.  For food, the mixed greens salad with chicken was fantastic and an incredible value as it would have made more than a full meal on its own - fortunately, we split it because we also ordered fish and chips and sausage with sauerkraut as our main courses.  They were fine, not spectacular.  However, overall, given the quality, service, and ambiance, we'd say the food was well worth the prices.  Beer's a bit pricey but they do have a good selection on tap.

Bottom line, liked it, would return.  It is a nice little get-away for an evening if you live in the Vegas valley as it has a totally different feel.  Allow extra time for a nice walk after your meal to see the town, the bridge, etc."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to stop here for dinner before Shakespeare in the park.  We decided on sharing the Irish nachos and the roast beef sandwich. The Irish nachos were a bit salty but still good. The roast beef sandwich on the other hand was sooo yummy!  It comes on this toasted bread that had cheese melted on it. It also had horseradish mayo on it.  So much tastier than I thought it would be!   Our waitress was super nice and the atmosphere was fun. Definitely try it out when you're down in lake Las Vegas"}
{"text":"I am actually really liked this place. Despite the reviews being a little mixed we decided to stop in and try it for an after work happy hour. During happy hour their aps are half off which was an instant positive in my book. I tried both the corn beef tacos and the Irish quesadilla and enjoyed both. The tacos took my by surprise in a good way and definitely left an impression since I keep thinking about them every time we pass. Their nutella brownie was delicious and overall our service was very friendly. 

My only complaint was that as the afternoon progressed our waitress disappeared. She forgot a cider refill and messed up the bill a bit, but it was obvious she was stretched a little thin. Some of the people in my party did not enjoy their apps as much as I did mine so I was glad I made the choices I did. I definitely see us coming back and trying out more of the menu."}
{"text":"Decent food, semi pricy drinks, decent service. Sometimes you feel ignored other times it's all good. They say they have strongbow which is my favorite cider / beer But they hit 3 strikes with me, I went there 3 times and every time they were out and said they always have it. The corned beef is a little plain but the steamed veggies and shepards pie is decent, I do see myself reaching for the tabasco and spicy mustard a lot there :( It's good enough to occasionally stop in but nothing to rant and rave about."}
{"text":"Killer beer list and the veggie burger and fries were delicious! The service was great too. Food came super fast. It's in a strange location at Lake Las Vegas. My parents and I kept saying we felt like we were in the Twilight Zone. Quite depressing actually... surrounded by vacant shops and the eerie Hilton Hotel. You have to park in the parking garage next to the closed down casino and walk through the corridor connecting the hotel and parking garage. I believe the corridor is on level 5. Or you can cut across the front of the casino that's dark and weird as well and head down the outdoor staircase to the shops. Wouldn't do it alone at night. The restaurants down there really need to put some signs out directing people."}
{"text":"I like this place.  The atmosphere is a mix between sports bar and an American version of Irish Pub.  Food was reasonably priced.  This was my first time having boxty.  Let me tell you, I'm a fan.  Boxty is an Irish potato pancake topped with various goodies.  I had the Irish Stew Boxty which comes with tender chunks of beef slow cooked with potatoes, carrots, celery, onion, and fresh herbs in a rich brown gravy.  Beware: the Auld Dubliner is quite a walk from car, through the parking structure, through the casino, and out the other side.  I enjoyed the walk, but some people may not want to walk that far."}
{"text":"Moist, fresh food from a chain, on the west side. Who'd have thunk?

--actual STEAMED fresh vegetables, not micro frozen. see what little effort it takes?
--loved the \"buffalo\" potatoes; nicely cooked, bite-size, drenched in wing sauce with ranch for dipping. BING.
--really pricey for what it is. $14 for a basic salad? where do you think we are, Scottsdale?
--too many windows, too much light to be a proper pub
--decor from some pick-by-page-and-letter Irish kitsch catalog.
--um. there's a metal fishnet thing on the ceiling!
--all two- and four-tops except for a giant picnic-table size 16-top: you can't bring your extra 0.6 out of 2.6 children -- who needed him anyway?
--ding for leaving my half-and-half on the bar for 5 minutes; this is a PUB, lady! Don't keep me from my Guiness and Harp!

Something surreal about the popup mall that sits across from a dead field. And right on the corner is the Auld Dubliner. Far too many windows for a proper pub. Fill those in, man! And what do we get to look at? The empty dead field across the street.

Although very moist and fresh, the food here is mostly bland. Thank God for Coleman's mustard. Between us all we emptied the entire jar onto our food; ok, most of it was on my plate, but hey!"}
{"text":"The food was not all that good, and my wife and daughter did not feel particularly well after eating there.  It was also pretty pricey, especially for a place in a deserted shopping center."}
{"text":"Great fish and chips, nice batter not too heavy. The sausage rolls are a must. Great traditional pub beers and a decent whiskey selection too. The stew was lovely, a half order goes a long way!"}
{"text":"I really like this place.  They have the cutest waitress, Renee, that has such a bubbly personality.  She's always super busy with tables too, but she gets the orders right and stays upbeat.  I love that! 

They have deliciously tender ribs and great fries. I also love their fish and chips.  One piece is enough as they serve up huge pieces.  

I tried a mimosa the first time I was there and the last time Renee suggested that I mix two beers, one was a wheat beer and perhaps the other was just some sort of cider.  I don't know.  She gave me a sample first and it was delicious and paired well with the fish and chips so I was happy.  

They recently put on the Monte Lago Beer Fest which was packed with people, had great music, and brought some much needed life to the Lake.  I'm glad this business is here and I wish them continued success (and hope they keep planning events)."}
{"text":"We got a groupon for Auld Dubliner because we mistakenly thought it was a restaurant we had seen near us and wanted to try it.

It's very difficult to find and took us an hour of driving around the area to get to it.  The Casinos and resorts around it have died off and we weren't sure how to get to it once we did find it and we ended up hiking with our 4 kids in 120 degree heat. On the up side,  we did find a place it would have been better to park at.

Once inside, it was clear that although *some* Auld Dubliners are family friendly, this one was more of a bar and less of a restaurant. There were no real tables that could accomodate a family of 6.  We had to sit with two rickety bar tables scooted together that were different heights. The chairs were also unstable. The waitress was nice, but you could tell she wondered why we had brought our kids to a place like this.

The menu on line was 20% less expensive than the actual menu and this was in the daytime hours.

We had wanted to order authentic corned beef and cabbage.  What we got was a whole cabbage cut in half, with very little corned beef and some kind if cream poured over it....All this for $1495.

In all, not a great experience.  Maybe it's better at night for couples."}

I loved this place already because they allow pets on leashes on the outdoor patio.  All of Montelago Village is very pet friendly - it is a fun place to walk your dog and enjoy the Lake Las Vegas views.  The food at Auld Dubliner happens to be pretty darn good as well.  The Irish Quesadilla had very good fresh salsa on the side.  The seared tuna salad had a lot of flavor and the fish was very fresh.  Nice selections of imported beers on draft too.

Don't forget the $5 Irish Car Bombs during Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"\"OK class!  Repeat after me...Overpriced Irish Bar Food\".
Now, don't get me wrong-I dig this place, but mainly for the outdoor seating and awesome atmosphere.  It's a great place to bring out-of-town guests-especially if you wanna relax and kick-back a few beers.
I usually order the fish and chips and curry french fries.  Be warned: the FULL size order are 2 huge fish pieces..wow...lots of food, BUT not great food.
Our waitress seemed a little more impressed with herself than us, so that was annoying. Come to think of it, her attitude could be justification for my 8 month old to fling his Fisher-Price teething ring at her as she 'occasionally' sauntered past. 
My summary is:
Irish banger (burnt)wonton appetizer+2 dinners of fish and chips+4 beers=$89.00!!!!!
Bundle that up with Little Miss Prissy Pants and I left thinking I could have fried my own fish and drank a couple Guinness while relaxing on the patio in my PJs.  All that and have $60 still in my wallet.
Go have beer and sit outside.  Eat later."}
{"text":"A PUB WHERE THERE ARE NO WORRIES

  The Auld Dubliner is a touch of Ireland situated in a lakeside Montelago Village in the Las Vegas desert. When you step inside Auld Dubliner Pub, an Irish pub awaits. From the wooden fixtures to the bar and tables, imported Irish furnishings are a touch away. When David Copley created the Auld Dubliner he gave Lake Las Vegas an authentic Irish pub. It is more than furnishings that bring Ireland to Lake Las Vegas. It is the drinks, beer, wine and pub food including burgers and fish & chips. 

The Daniel S-pectation:

    I walked into the Auld Dubliner to enjoy a cold one while watching sports before spending time outside along the Lake. 

My experience of the Sunday, January 25 visit:

   In similar style to today's Lake Las Vegas Montelago Village, this was one laid-back place. The majority of the patrons sat outside in the patio dining at the tables overlooking the Montelago Village. I was the sole bar patron. In the front of the house was a staff of two: the bartender and waitress. The waitress would complain to the bartender, who made the drinks in front of me, that certain customers were showing a lack of appreciation toward her job. She was a hard worker and personable to me. The bartender was really laid-back and attentive. His catch phrase was \"no worries.\" When a customer complained about a drink glass, he fixed the problem with a, \"No worries.\" When the waitress let off some steam, his response was, \"no worries.\" When he checked on me and I said everything was good, his response was, \"No worries.\" And when I drank my pint of PBR, there were no worries. 

  Being Lake Las Vegas, they charge Las Vegas Strip prices. I was only having one beer. I was content sipping a $4 pint of PBR while watching professional golf on the large TV screen. If it had been a Football Sunday, I might of taken advantage of a Carlsberg Game Time Special where a Bloody Mary, Jim Beam Stag shot, or Margarita is $5. Then again I'd most likely have stuck to a beer. In the daylight I'd prefer to be spending most of my time outside in the beautiful lakeside Montelago Village in the desert. 

  Now if I had been here at night, I might of spent a few hours in a less laid-back pub. Every night of the week there is a different event. Monday is kickball night. Tuesday is karaoke night. Wednesday is Gamer Night. Thursday is College and Ladies Night. Friday is Live Music Night. Saturday is DJ Dance Party Night. And Sunday is Service Industry Night. 

Conclusion- 3 & 1/2 stars:

  With the main casino shut down at the time of this review, Lake Las Vegas is in want of a bar scene. Gradually this might be changing with Brooklyns planned to open across the walking path. Meanwhile, The Auld Dubliner is a nice spot to experience the joys of an Irish pub in the lakeside Montelago Village in the desert. Concerning if I will return here, \"No worries.\"

{"text":"AVOID IF IT ISN'T ALREADY OUT OF BUSINESS

Three problems we encountered:

1. DUMPSTER. This pub's in a promenade immediately outside a casino. But the casino shut, and many of the other shops fled. So to reach this pub, you park in a mostly vacant garage, walk through the service entrance, past a giant reeking dumpster, and then past various shuttered establishments.

2. POOR VALUE. The Shepherd's Pie costs $18. Given its quality (let alone the pub's dismal surroundings), $12 would be appropriate.

3. WEAK SERVICE. On a Friday night, there appeared to be only one waitress. She was trying, but was very harried."}
{"text":"I was surprised by the small size of this pub, but additional seating is available on the patio.  Even though there was a concert scheduled for later in the evening, there was very little pedestrian traffic on the street this evening.  We each ordered fish and chips; the former was heavily battered and the latter was from the freezer case. There many places to find better fish & chips."}
{"text":"Good prices, nice outdoor seating, friendly staff. What more can you ask for in a pub? 

It's a lot less commercialized than Fado's, and the live music doesn't suck nearly as much. It's a welcome change for Sean and I to have a place where we can go and just have a pint when we're in the area."}
{"text":"This is a nice looking and fun Irish pub for Peoria.  Located in the Park West complex, which is beautiful, but I feel was part of the overbuilt boom in the Phoenix metro.  This malls location is in an area that doesn't fit the demographics.  It's just to nice for the area and I don't know how it will survive.  Most of what you see are vacant store fronts and beautiful landscaping all around.

The inside of the pub is made to look like as authenic as can be.  This and the great beer selection make this a step ahead of several other Irish pubs out there.  The service I've experienced has always been good and I'd say if you're in the area pop your head in and take a look at the digs with a cold beer."}
{"text":"Jared and Joey are awesome! The wings I had were monumental. This bar has 24 taps ready to serve. I met Joseph, the GM. We talked baseball and he was a boss. I can't wait to come back to this pub. Try the mussels you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"I was at Lake Las Vegas last night with my wife and we looked around at the other restaurants but nothing struck our fancy so we decided to give Auld Dubliner another chance.  We walked in and were told it was seat yourself.  We sat down and waited, and waited, and waited.  We were there for 10-15 minutes and no one even spoke to us.  The best part was that two different waiters were serving two different tables on either side of us.  They definitely saw us, saw we had no menus or drinks, and still did nothing.  I was willing to give this place another chance because the food was good the first time and just the service was bad.  I guess the bad service is their standard and I will never go back here again."}
{"text":"Auld Dubliner is one of the reasons I wish more people would go to Lake Las Vegas.  It's a typical Irish bar, mostly wooden, smaller tables, but you actually have some room.  It's not crammed together.  We've only been inside, but they have patio seating as well when the weather is nice.

They have an above average selection for beers, with the usual emphasis on Irish and British beers.  I got a flight of testers that was a decent price, given the quality of beers.  The food was above average as well.  Very large serving of fish and chips.  Good batter, but not too thick.  We got chicken fingers (for our 2 year old), and the table liked these as well.  

Service was excellent.  Drinks never reached empty before she was there asking if we wanted another.  There seemed to be several regulars as well, which is rarely a bad sign.  Overall, above average experience, which is saying something, given the number of Irish pubs that have opened in the last few years.  Worth your time."}
{"text":"Indeed, this is an Irish Pub found lakeside along the streets of the Italian village of Lake Las Vegas.  Then again, one can find an Irish pub just about anywhere in the world, you just gotta look!

We noticed it right away as we made our way down the lake during the past Saturday.  The free opera on the lake had us more intrigued, but the live music had us make a return after the opera performance.  This place was popping, mostly because a wedding party was celebrating their after party there.  

The band playing was giving up some pretty cool tunes, and we soon found out why.  They were were Acoustic Soul, \"...the first, fully live, by-request acoustic rock band in Vegas\" as noted on their myspace page.  And they were pretty good.  The BF and I got a drink at the bar ($5.50 for a pint) and settled in to listen to them play various songs from Johnny Cash to Britney Spears to John Mayer to Eric Clapton.  They were good and everyone was loving them.

We can't say too much about The Auld Dubliner except that they offer outdoor seating, which can be great on certain nights.  And they do serve up Magners Cider for us non-beer drinkers.  You can also find food here for lunch and dinner.  Nonetheless, I think the BF and I will be returning on Saturday nights to catch Acoustic Soul performing.  (They apparently have live bands every Friday and Saturday night, maybe even Sunday too.)

Update (07/20/09) - They have happy hour daily from 3 pm to 7 pm.  All their draft beers are $5, no discount on food though.  Bummer."}
{"text":"Food was awesome! I had blackened ahi tuna salad which was the best I ever had! Truly! My companions had the Reuben and the blackened ahi tuna tacos and raved about those dishes too! Service was friendly too. I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"We came after the Brews Best to sop up the beer.

The BF and I shared a full portion of fish and chips ($16). Pretty good and standard. Crisp big fish filets and fries. Our friends seem happy with their food, but some are really effing drunk too. 

Service was OK. It was busy and no one was attentive. No drinks offfered, no water offered specially. No one came to check on us. I don't know if this is the norm or only because they're not used to ever being a full house. 

It did it's job and was good beer food."}
{"text":"Brought a group here for my wedding rehearsal dinner after-party and it was great!  They accommodated our whole group and everyone had a good time.  Live music and drink specials were just what we wanted."}
{"text":"Try the Reuben.

Great environment and great food.  Very traditional style Irish food.  I will be making plans to be there on St. Patrick's Day for sure."}
{"text":"Fish and chips plate worth the money! However, the Irish nachos were a disappointment. The housemade chips could not hold the weight of the barley seen \"nacho cheese\" and the sour cream/toppings were used sparingly."}
{"text":"Great Irish food.  Excellent service.  We will definitely be coming back.. must try the spicy potato balls.  Very good"}
{"text":"The Auld Dubliner (TAD) is an oasis of life in the dying landscape that is Montelago Village, Lake Las Vegas. This mainstay has outlasted most of  the other businesses and restaurants in Montelago because of it's mix of traditional Irish Pub charm and its picturesque setting. 

The drink selections are standard for a high-end Irish Pub. They offer a nice selection of beers including some rare ones on tap (Kilkenny, anyone?). The food is Irish with a twist (try the Banger Won Ton) and all of it is good to great. Service is prompt and friendly, no matter how busy or slow they are. 

The main draw here is the atmosphere, which can't be beaten. Montelago Village is cut directly from a Tuscan picture book and the outdoor seating at TAD offers a good vantage point to take it all in. And while Montelago is definitely past its prime with more empty storefronts than anything else, the setting is still serene. 

There are two things keeping The Auld Dubliner from being a 5 star joint and the best Irish Pub in Vegas. First is the price. Irish Pubs aren't the best place for the budget minded and TAD is no exception. Outside of $4 pint specials and other weekly events you can expect to drop quite a lot of money on good booze and grub. The other drawback is the setting, yes I love Montelago Village but the emptiness out here is palpable. You can't help but hear the plaintive moans of the dead business out here as you walk the empty streets. It borders on post-apocalyptic. That said,  there isn't a better place to spend your time among the last living denizens of Montelago Village than The Auld Dubliner."}
{"text":"No major changes to report here. Tried the corned beef sliders this time and they were incredible. The cheddar ale soup on the other hand was just ok."}
{"text":"Well this was the first #wvfn. The #evfn usually draws 40+ folks so many of us were anxious to see where things went. We had about 20 folks at one point and here goes the report.
I got there about 6:02 made the wrong turn and so when I asked about Happy Hour was told I just missed it . I asked about a small extension and was rebuffed.  I mentioned that we were a larger group and that the should consider going to 7pm, and that it probably costs them $300 in sales by stopping at 6pm as oppose to the old stand by of 7pm. Deaf ears.

I ordered mu usualy Pilsner Urquel which came back a) flat and b) no foam ..come on Czech's like some foam and c) I think they flew to Pilzen to get the beer. I did not order food, I would have but since happy hour was not offered I passed.

I did get to sample a sausage from my buddy next to me. His meal came with 3 and while the sausage as tasty the meal was cold, as was the potato leek soup. We were outside in fairness but still I was expecting a little more.

The shining moment were the waitresses, they came by often and asked if we were ok and needed anything. So I am thinking it was not them who flew to Pilzen for the best beer made. We got plenty of attention which has always been a problem with #evfn. We shall see as our group grows."}
{"text":"We were in the area and I was starving so my friend and I went here since there's not very many options in Lake Las Vegas. Usually, when I'm starving, food tastes better and I finish everything on my plate. 

The place wasn't busy at all. The servers were quite friendly to the older men. The food came out 20-30 minutes after placing our order.

BBC Burger:
My friend loved this burger. It has pickles, bacon, chipotle BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato and onions. They have turkey options for their burgers if you don't eat beef. The patty was tasty and juicy. The chipotle BBQ sauce was delish. This came with curry fries. 4/5

Fish Sandwich:
This looked so good but doesn't taste as good. It comes in a toasted brioche bun, tartar sauce, pickles, onions, tomato, lettuce and a huge piece of fried and breaded fish. No flavor though. 2/5

Garlic Parmesan Fries:
Whenever I see garlic parm fries on the menu, I have to have it. No ifs, ands or buts about it. However, I was mighty disappointed with this version. It had no flavor to it. I sprinkled lots of salt just so I could eat this. Lots of oil, no garlic/Parmesan taste. I couldn't finish this. 1/5

This was a bad choice for a cheat meal and it made me so sad. I only ate half of whatever we ordered. It's like they have something against flavor."}
{"text":"I give this place 4 stars because of the staff and atmosphere. Joseph was a trooper even though we gave him some weird request. Like desert first, the meal with the appetizer. Desert we had the Creme brûlée and the chocolat brownie. The brûlée wins hands down. Yes it can feed 4. The sausage roll was different. Moist in the middle. My favorite was the bangers and champ and the meatloaf. The fish was good in the fish and chips. The breading was kind of thick. Some folks like that. Overall meals were good. The 4.5 star experience here was joseph our bartender he is a rockstar so ask for him by name..."}
{"text":"We were at Lake Las Vegas with some friends for the Dragon Boat Festival. We decided to get a snack and some beers. The beer specials for the day weren't great but they were in range with most bar beer prices in Las Vegas. The menu was also special for the day. We all ended up sharing the Spicy New Potatoes and an order of Irish Nachos with Corned Beef. I surprised myself and really enjoyed the nachos, there were tons of toppings on them and the chips were crisp, not greasy. They were a tad pricey for the amount that was on the plate. The spicy potatoes were good, not as spicy as I thought they'd be, but were tasty especially with the buttermilk dipping sauce. 
The service was adequate. We sat outside on the patio since we had our dog with us, flies were a bit bothersome. The place was busy so I wasn't surprised that the women's bathroom was a disaster, but then find out the men's room was clean. What the heck women!!
I would give them another try if in the area, I especially like the dog friendly aspect."}
{"text":"I've been to pretty much every restaurant in Lake Las Vegas and the pub is by far the best and one of the best restaurants I've ever been to. The service is great and the food is amazing! The ahi tuna tacos, fish tacos and Reuben sandwich are a must try. Oh and the nachos with corned beef are great too! I've honestly never had anything bad there. My roommate and I go at least once a week! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"We've eaten at The Auld Dubliner several times when we've been to Lake Las Vegas. We've enjoyed it every time. The Chicken Boxty is soooo good! Our last visit was on a Friday night, luckily we got a table before it was too crowded. Our drinks and food were served quickly. There was only one server, which is odd for a Friday night, especially since the place was packed before we were finished, but she was running around doing the best she could. We were happy with our service."}
{"text":"Went here las month only to find the poor little busboy did all the work! Our tiny angry server treated us like we were bothering her  when we sat down . she demanded our order & we never saw her again the rest of the 25 mins we were there. Food wasnt bad , rueben was great  ,fish so so. Huge disappointment after reading rave reviews."}
{"text":"We used the Groupon for this establishment tonight.  The food was fantastic!  My 3 year old had the apples, cheese, and potato crapes.  She was less thrilled with her meal, but had a good time none the less.  I was pleasantly surprised that this bar type place did have kids cups.  A bit pricy for the kids food, but I don't think we would have brought her if we didn't have the groupon.

Lake Las Vegas is clearly a sad place adversely effected by the economy.  The parking situation sort of sucked, but now that we know the casino is closed, we would park on the far side of the Village in the dirt rather than the garage.  The live jazz down the way afterwards was nice:Saturdays between 7pm-11pm.  

I would have given this place 4 stars if it wasn't so far away with the hassle.  I hope that when they lease is up, they find a place in a better part of Henderson."}
{"text":"I went here on a Tuesday night and as usual, this very nice Las Vegas Resort area was sadly very deserted...  My wife and I tried this restaurant since we do enjoy a good Pub.  This was among the worst services I've ever had - I can't think of a worse one that didn't involve the manager coming up and comping our meal.  We were in no hurry, so we didn't make a fuss out of it, but we were ridden by \"apologies\" when the waitress forgot to bring us something we requested, but then she would never correct it by actually bringing it!  The sad thing is that there was really no excuse because this restaurant was about as empty as the Resort area.   The food was actually pretty good, but it would have been nice with the sides/refills we requested but never received.  Also my pint of Guinness was like 9 bucks, which I just find ridiculous - especially for an Irish Pub.  I'm giving it 2 stars just because the experience may be different on a weekend and also the food was actually good."}
{"text":"This is an OK bar at the Lakes to have a few  drinks. But only if the Mexican bar is too crowded. Which it was, so we didn't have any choices. The bartender we had over Labor Day weekend was depressed and a total downer. It was actually insulting to pay casino prices here in this little pub where there were maybe 15 people and the bartender treats you like you're a bother. Here you will pay $$$$ for your booze. $15 shot of Jameson. Thank goodness there was a decent singer for some touch of personality. Next time we visit The Lakes, we'll make sure to get to the other bar sooner."}
{"text":"YUM! Stopped here for lunch on a family stay-cay at Lake Las Vegas.  Staff was friendly, food was REALLY good, and the atmosphere was great.

Be careful of the salsa it's got hot HOT peppers in it.  But the fish tacos are amazing!

Good place for lunch!"}
{"text":"The Auld Dubliner:
A pitcher perfect image of what I my minds eye of an ole Irish pub could be like should I ever have the opportunity to visit Ireland.  Small spaces for dinning and a bar running  1/2 the length of the little establishment.  By far more patrons sitting and standing around the bar as anything from Soccer, Boxing, and even NBA basket ball played on the many TVs located behind the bar and throughout the place.  I was with a group of 8 and we were seated quickly and drink orders taken.  Many at the table enjoyed what they said was robust logger and dark dense taste.  Must have been pretty good as there were several rounds ordered.   I had the Fish-n-Chips for dinner and \"Boy Howdy\" was this thing huge.  My plate was large but the two pieces of beer battered code were a lot bigger and hung off the side like two full racks of Memphis Dry Rubbed Ribs.  Now the taste of the fish is on par with most fish-n-chip places I've eaten at, but what might be lacking in the taste department this place over delivers in atmosphere, service, and just feeling like your at home with your buds.  Really a great place to come and relax after a full day of corporate meeting, testing, and sales roll play."}
{"text":"Awesome service! Our server was really nice and prompt.
Great food too. My husband had the reuben and i had the fish sandwich. Good portions and really nicely decorated place!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best fish tacos I've ever eaten! That is the fresh ahi tuna ones, and not the deep fried. I don't see it on their website today. Please don't tell me they took it off the menu! I know it is not your usual Irish fare, but who cares if it tastes that good! Also try the curry chips. These are not chips (fries) with a little flavorless curry powder sprinkled on top. It has the curry sauce on the side, for your dowsing pleasure. I could eat it by the spoonful.

I took away one star cause I have to drive so far to get my fix. Really worth the drive out there though."}
{"text":"Been back several times now. The only fault  is the price which seems dissonant with the address. Isn't the  whole point of  Irish food, least as mythologized,is the hearty cheap nature of it?  $14 for a boxty is taking us for eejits. So far the best we've found on the West side but I'd rather hit McCaffrey's up unless I'm really close to this one."}
{"text":"Enjoy this place before it is really \"discovered\" by folks in the West Valley.  Located NW corner of the 101 & Northern in the large shopping area.  It's on the right when you enter the main street that leads up to the movie theatre.

Traditional wood snugs, nice lineup of taps, and proper glassware for the pints of Guinness.  We only had dessert and it was quite good, though the portion was a bit small.  Pints of Guinness were served well with a proper pour and the logoed glass enhances the experience for this beautiful ale.

Menu looks to offer traditional pub favories with a modern spin on some of them.  Prices were reasonable as far as pubs go, especially compared to that Lis Dun Varna up the street.  I will be back soon for appetizers and main course, but so far as dessert spot with a few pints this place is great."}
{"text":"The best meatloaf ever proclaimed my GF. It was damn good but I couldnt help but to wonder if the incredible gravy didn't have a lot to do with it. 

My gf loves bloody marys and having seen the reviews on yelp she was excited to try one. The excitement ended there as it isn't a \"normal\" bloody mary. They dice up the celery and mix it with a few secret ingredients.

We tried to figure them out but couldnt. Whitney was our servers name and she was wonderful and knowledgeable about all the beers they had and made great recommendations 

All in all it was a good place to eat but for $65 with tip we should have had more than meatloaf a chicken salad and 2 drinks.

Cant give them 5 stars due to the price and most beers being in bottles but for a once in a great while I would come back."}
{"text":"I stopped by on St. Pat's to see what kind of party was going on, and I had heard this was a fun place on St. Pat's. 
Guinness samples were passed out, along with some whiskey, and they had Guinness swag also. They must have some pull to have promoters come way out here for the holiday! 
The bar is open to the patio, which is nice when the weather permits! They had live music and a pretty nice crowd for Lake Las Vegas. I've eaten here a few times and was impressed with some of their appetizers, and the reuben sandwich was pretty good too. They always have banners up advertising daily specials such as $4 drafts and other special offers. 

The decor is very nice and true to the pub theme. Nice beer selection which of course features brews from Ireland and Britain. I'm not sure that I can suggest making the trek to Lake Las Vegas just to eat and drink here, but pair that with strolling along the marina, visiting some shops or partaking in the water sports also is recommended."}
