{"text":"We stopped here and had a fantastic lunch!  Food was fresh and very tasty.  Can't wait to come back.  Wife, myself and kids all loved it which is hard to accomplish these days.  Fried pickles were incredible!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch for the first time. Enjoyed the Main Street patio under a shady umbrella.   Got the pork tenderloin special. Usually this is not an exciting meal but here it was cooked to perfection and VERY flavorful with herbs and spices. Over rice, with grilled onions, mushrooms and red/green peppers.   Got a crisp fresh salad and mac and cheese for sides...all of this for 8.95?!?! I will be back soon.   Service was the cherry on top. This place is a boon to downtown Mt. Holly. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"A lot to be desired.  Service was slow, very  slow. 25 minutes just to get a salad. Drinks remained empty. I was about to leave when my meal finally was brought out to me. If that wasn't bad enough here is the kicker. My meal said grilled on the menu, it came out fried also they forget my sides. Wait, it gets worse to top it all the meal was overpriced 70 dollars for a family of 4 no appetizers and we all had water. Needless to say I will not be returning.  I hope people will read this before its to late, and no make the mistake of dining here, you will leave dissatisfied."}
{"text":"This place has a nice outdoor seating area and the servers are nice and friendly. The food is bad. Mac and cheese tastes worse than the boxed stuff I usually make, more similar to high school cafeteria mac and cheese (noodles are overcooked and falling apart, like they were made early morning and just left in a pot the entire day). My salad tasted good, just a typical bar salad, and I ate it fine until I found a dead bee that looked half-way decomposed hiding under a piece of lettuce. The chicken sandwich I ordered left much to be desired. The lettuce was old and saggy, the tomato was overripe and soft, and the chicken, which promised to be grilled, was breaded and deep fried. The deep fried would've been great but it was also saggy and wet, not a crispy nice chicken sandwich. I paid $18 before tip for a meal and didn't order a drink. Maybe my standards are high but mc donalds (which I hate) is far better, and honestly that shouldn't even be a comparison point for a sit down place like this."}
{"text":"We eat lunch here every day. Daily specials are always good. Complimentary soup at lunch. Staff and owners are very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"What a wonderful surprise. Very nice up fit of the space and pristinely clean. Our waitress was informative and friendly. We wanted an afternoon snack - husband ordered 3 veggie platter - creamed cabbage, collards and white beans. I ordered an appetizer of flash-fried sesame shrimp. We both received complimentary soup. I had chicken with rice - not usually my choice but I have a cold & thought that would be soothing. It far surpassed my expectations. It was thick & flavorful. Very satisfying. Husband had vegetable soup and was equally pleased. The shrimp was perfectly prepared (no tails!!) crispy and delicious with Thai aioli and they didn't spare the sesame seeds. I tasted husband's creamed cabbage - heavenly! Can't wait to go back and try some other delicacies. It's a large menu - something for everybody."}
{"text":"I was honestly hesitant of this place but I've been twice this month and I haven't been disappointed. The food appeared fresh, tasty and reasonably priced. My husband ordered the flounder and shrimp combo, really tasty and huge portions !!!! I had a burger and fries, it was cooked to temperate and very juicy . Normally I'm not a French fries person but theirs was delicious, great seasoning.   We also had the pimento cheese dip, so tasty and could feed more than it appears. We will be back again"}
{"text":"Been there several times now and, at best, it's just ok.  Had lunch today and for first time not greeted with enthusiasm by hostess.  Wait staff also tend to be ok, maybe it's the training.  Sandwich and fries were good.  Convenient location."}
{"text":"My wife and I came for a late lunch and had a great meal. Our server was Gabriel and she was super friendly. Drinks and appetizer came right away, and not much longer our meal arrived as well. We will definitely be coming back to try other items we saw as waitresses walked by. The Mt Holly burger and their chicken sandwich both looked HUGE... nice atmosphere with nice people"}
{"text":"My first time experiencing 128 South Main Chophouse was after church one Sunday with a party of 6. Right off the bat, there was some mass confusion regarding where to put our larger party and we were paraded around the restaurant for awhile before being seated in the, otherwise empty, bar. Our waitress arrived promptly and was incredibly friendly and charismatic, but seemed rather overwhelmed and flustered.   We each ordered and, as we waited, two larger parties came in and were seated with us. The larger of the two parties (probably close to 20 people) ordered drinks, waited a decent amount of time and then got up and left the restaurant. Again, the waitress was precious and apologetic but seemed to be tremendously overwhelmed. When food arrived, I had ordered the Honey Chicken. The chicken was quite good but the sides were rather bland. When it came time to pay the bill, there was some massive confusion about change and my friend was told he only put in a $20 when he put in $40, and it was generally a mess. Overall, it wasn't a bad experience at all. It was just underwhelming. Everything from the service to the food was just \"okay.\"   A week later, my father-in-law who had been with us on the first trip, suggested going again. Truthfully, I wasn't really looking forward to it. There were only 3 of us this time and we were seated immediately. My father-in-law went for the Sunday Specials menu (pretty much any Southern country cookin' style entree & side you can imagine) while my mother-in-law and I both ordered the Fried Flounder and Shrimp. I went with fries and mac-and-cheese as sides (#healthygirl). This time, the food was quite delicious. The same waitress helped us out this time and didn't seem nearly as overwhelmed (but was just as sweet!) It was a much improved experience, for sure. I'm hoping that the first experience can just be chalked up to Opening Pains as the restaurant was only a few weeks old and opening on Sundays was even more recent than that! In addition to the good food and sweet service, the owners of the restaurant were present and fully involved in the entire operation both times. They stopped by most tables, refilled drinks, and even mentioned that the entire family was working in some capacity or another that day. Their dedication certainly caught my eye & will play a large part in the success of this new restaurant!"}
{"text":"Well all was not well tonight at South Main.  We were a table of seven that all had one problem or another  The first and biggest problem was getting food  The server did her job but things went downhill from there.  We had to ask for ketchup, salt, pepper, bread and butter and that was before the food arrived.  The server did stop and let us know that our orders got lost in the shuffle but were being prepared  A little to longer later the food arrived or most of it.  The temperature was for the most part warm not hot.  I ordered a burger and steamed broccoli but burger and fries is what arrived  Six of the seven got food so that left one person sitting and watching while we ate  When his food did arrive the meat was way rare and he ordered medium  They took that back so he was back to just watching  The second plate came out again a little to later and was not much better.  He gave up and ate very little and his meal was taken care of  by the manager as it should have been.   I really don't want to give a bad review because I really like this place but I can't give a good one either.  Was it just a bad night or something that regularly happens  I'm going with the bad night but I have to say it was a very bad night."}
{"text":"Great food. Extremely poor service. If a hostess has asked for your drink order, it will confuse her cause she doesn't know the drink menu--LEARN IT!. Waitress was so lost she should have been in a jungle. Couldn't remember anything. Food came fast, once ordered. Again great food but server training is very necessary for a good full review. Hope that happens Stat!"}
{"text":"I hate writing one star reviews but I have to be honest here. We had 5 adults in our party on a Saturday night. We were seated right away and did not have to wait. Our waitress was very friendly. The atmosphere was okay, not as intimate as we typically like for a steakhouse. The waitress brought out fresh rolls and honey butter. The rolls were warm, but the taste was a 2 out of 10. I had spaghetti with meat sauce, my in laws had spaghetti with marinara, and my husband and sister in law had ribeye sandwiches. Three of us had side salads, which were great. I enjoyed the balsamic vinaigrette. My spaghetti was terrible. The sauce was extremely sweet. I couldn't eat it. The garlic bread was soggy. My father in laws spaghetti came with a ton of sauce and minimal noodles. He asked for a side of noodles to even it out a bit. The marinara spaghetti was mediocre at best, neither finished their meals. My sister in law ordered the ribeye sandwich well done. It came out medium rare and had to be sent back. The ribeye sandwich had no flavor, except for char. It tasted like bland char. Fries were bland and flavorless. We did not want to be rude and all complain, so we just paid and vowed never to return."}
{"text":"Needs a little help. The menu options are pretty good but everything was just so bland. The steak options are VERY overpriced. Everything needs to be so much tastier and less fake looking and bland tasting before I'm willing to pay $20 for a steak. The server was super slow although the kitchen was wicked fast. It was a weird experience."}
{"text":"We visited 8 days ago and I gave them 3 stars.  The service was horrible but the food was good.   We went again tonight.  Our server Jessica T.  What a difference.  She was on point and very attentive.   My husband had the Shrimp and Grits.  It was not his favorite he has ever had  but it was very good.  I had the chopped sirloin and asparagus  it was excellent!  Very well seasoned and juicy.   For desert we had apple dumpling.  I t was also amazing.   I really would want to give 4 1/2 stars just because they still only serve select beer.   No wine.  We will go back."}
{"text":"Pimento and cheese dip is good. Husbands steak was super thin and couldn't be cooked medium rare. Decor is really nice and good service, food overall is okay not great"}
{"text":"What a great place! We are in town for the Green Bay Packer game, and stumbled upon this place close to our Air BnB. Great service and recommendations for a town we've never been to. The hospitality was amazing and made us feel like home. Cold beer, great food, excellent company. I would definitely recommend if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Tryed this place again after a bad customer service experience!!! Entirely different!! Food was excellent! Service was excellent!! Michelle took amazing care of us!! Will definitely come herr again!"}
{"text":"I ordered takeout. Spaghetti came with garkic bread and side salad. The sauce was a weird btown sauce, definitely not typical Italian style. This didnt look or taste like fresh tomatoes.  Thr meatballs were hugh buy lacked seasoning. Definitely wont get their pasta dish again. The atmosphere is dish and plenty of seating. The staff is veey friendly.  They have daily specials alpt of fried food which i try to stay away from. I will visit again maybe will try  a steak or seafood and chrck out their wines also. Im just glad mount holly has this dining option because this area is very limited. I akso saw flyers for live music and i believe poetry. I recommend to give this place a try espically for lunch since less crowded."}
{"text":"What a hidden treasure.  Had a light lunch.  Me absolutely wonderful 3 veg plate.  All fresh, no canned stuff here.  My wife had the South Main Shrimp appetizer.  They were amazing.  Service was prompt, efficient and extremely friendly.!  Noticed a couple sitting across the isle and the gentleman was having the baked lasagna.  Portions are huge.  The lasagna looked and smelled so good we ordered a plate to go for our dinner.  This will be a destination for us in the future."}
{"text":"Pimento Cheese dip was wonderful. Steak was very flavorful. MUCH better than J. Peters. Ribs were a little on the fatty side.  The thing that made the evening was the service.  Food timing perfect.  Waitress was very competent.  Busboy, Aiden..wow. Very diligent and polite.    Wonderful local flavor."}
{"text":"I stopped by here after the Whitewater Center, and I was pleasantly surprised. The place is spacious, modern and rustic looking. The service was fast and the food was at a good rate and most of all it was delicious. This will be my go to place when I am near the center.  I would say that this is the best restaurant in the area.  I definitely recommend anyone in the area to try them out."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Just an average place. Not bad service, actually the service was great. Everyone I ate with seemed to like what they had. I ordered the salt and pepper catfish with slaw, fries, and hush puppies. It was below average and definitely not worth $13. Chicken King down the street offers same dish at $8 and it's always on point. So...probably not a bad place but not a place to get fried catfish. The inside was nice but in my opinion the tables need to be bigger. This is an area where more is more. Ya dig. I'll be back to try the lamb shanks though."}
{"text":"This place has great potential.  Food was good and the entire staff is eager to please.  They know they are new and want to make sure your experience is great!  Our food... spinach dip was great... pita chips were so good... our dinner salad was also good, salad dressings are homemade.  I had the beef tips with a salad as a side and macaroni and cheese.  The Mac had bacon on it!  Score... we didn't do dessert.  I will go back so they can earn the 5th star as I know they can do it.  You have to give these guys a chance to get in their groove!"}
{"text":"I'm visiting from out of town and this place has great hospitality. We came at a very slow time (2:45pm) but they were very attentive and nice to us Wisconsin folk. Received complimentary soup and got a lot of good advice about traveling around the area. Great environment and great people. Sounds like the owners are working to make this the best hangout place in Mount Holly for sure!"}
{"text":"This was probably one of the most awful, overly expensive dining out experiences I have ever had.  I have to start by saying that the waitress was attentive and friendly and we were seated immediately.  The shrimp cocktail was good, but it went downhill from there.  My entree was AWFUL.  I ordered the Beef Tips that were supposed to come with sautéed mushrooms and onions.  I saw about 4 slivers of mushrooms on the plate.  The steak appeared to simply be cut up pieces of beef, not the \"beef tips\" I expected, and they tasted a bit strange.  The garlic mashed potatoes required heavy salting and were gummy.  I was willing to overlook all of that, but at the end of the meal, I encountered a piece of steamed broccoli that appeared to have insect larvae on it.  Needless to say, I was done after that.  My husband and I paid our $55 (before tip) bill and then informed the manager of what I had found.  I think $15 was outrageous for what I got.  He appropriately apologized and offered to give us a credit for our next time in.  We waited around several minutes and noticed he was visiting with another table and it didn't appear service recovery was a priority, so we elected to just leave.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"First time at new place and will be back!  I got a salad and it was great and my wife tried the country style steak over rice, mashed potato, and a vegetable and the serving was plentiful.  Waiter was new but very friendly and very informative about this new place.  Was very mindful of our beverages and condiments.  The manager/owner dropped by twice to check and make sure our order was good and to offer if we needed anything else.  That make the start of a successful business endeavor!  Keep it up!"}
