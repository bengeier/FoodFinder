{"text":"Some of the best ox tail ive ever had. Good protion size. Service has improved everytime ive been there. Curry goat was very delicious as well. Chef is very friendly. Only issue is they charged my friend 95 cents for oxtail gravy on her rice! Never heard of that before at a west indian restaurant. Had the soup as well and it was great!"}
{"text":"Had Easter lunch with my family at Beryl's.  There were 14 of us in the group.  Everybody's food was excellent...absolutely delicious!!!  Service was great.  If you want good food in Pickering this is the place."}
{"text":"Much better quality jerk chicken dishes thank those in the area.  Take-out desk and service there needs more training or work in order to handle busy times and phone orders. Take Out food comes out tasty and hot; but there can be a wait if busy.  Goat and Chicken Roti is good, but prefer Roti 'n' Ting (which can't re-open soon enough)."}
{"text":"Food is good, however many times extremely salty beyond belief. Portions are good, but you have to pay extra for oxtail gravy - never heard of this before.   I'm giving only 1 star because the attitude at this place makes me embarrassed to be black. Honestly so much attitude for no reason and the thing is you never know what to expect when you walk in.   This is not acceptable behavior for a business, no one should be made to feel belittled or unvalued as your customers are what keep your business thriving. Not a difficult concept to grasp.   Another thing is when you walk in to order there's always some type of delay. Either the cashier is having a conversation with a friend or the cook and you must wait and wait and wait. They act like your none existent.  Your time is not respected or valued which is disrespectful.  They act like you're coming for free food and they're doing you a favor. So many spots in Toronto to eat West Indian food. Don't waste your time, money or moral dealing with their disgusting attitudes.  I have bought take out many times because it is close to where I live, but the service is fickle and declining gradually."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Fresh to order tho. Yor order will take 10 to 15 min depending on time of day. Curtious and friendly staff.If you don't mind waiting you will get great tasting food."}
{"text":"First time visiting Beryl's Pepper Pot, we're from Scarborough where there's a great selection of Jamaican food everywhere, but decided to try Beryl's after seeing the Pickering menu.  Minus double digit Temps this weekend, so I was craving something hot, so convinced hubby and two picky kids in tow, 9 & 10.  The waitress seated us promptly and graciously explained some of the less familiar dishes.  We started with the Ackee Salt fish Rolls which came with a kick sweet sauce -- to my delight, the kids LOVED it -- their first time ever trying something like this, I couldn't believe it!  Girly had kid's mango chicken and fries, son had macaroni with chicken in tomato sauce - both tasty but tame compared to me and hubby's Jerk Pork with Rice and Peas.  Well, kids wanted some of THAT too, and loved it just as much as we did, with lots of mango nectar juice to cool the heat.  The nice waitress checked back with us often, and we ended up taking food to go with the big portions.  My daughter wanted the deep fried mango cheesecake, so we all shared and battled over the last creamy bites.  Overall, a very pleasant dine in experience, prompt service and the dishes were presented really well.  There was a comment earlier about the cloth napkins and cutlery being too fancy, but we really liked it... so used to plastic cutlery, foam containers and wobbly tables/plastic chairs from other Roti places we've been to in Toronto, that Beryl's was a nice change and very clean and classy!  Classy without being pretentious .... and although there was some waiting for the food, it was worth it!  Just chill back and enjoy.  :-)  We will definitely be back to try the Rotis!  Now if only they served Doubles!!"}
{"text":"Best West Indian food in the City, hands down.  The jerk chicken / pork is amazing.  So too are the rotis and soups.  Oxtail and goat are also delicious.  The portions are generous.  If you're a Foodie hankering for Caribbean Cuisine, this place is not to be missed."}
{"text":"I love the jerk pork with the spicy gravy. Put  over some rice and it was delicious. Add a mango nectar with that or guava if that's what you prefer and you've got a yummy Caribbean meal.   The place was clean and everybody was very helpful and friendly. The food was reasonably priced for the portions as well."}
{"text":"Nice variety of dishes and yummy food. Even the rice and beans are full of flavour. They were out of roti when I popped in, so I went for the jerk chicken. Very good."}
{"text":"Had the food here twice.  Now my new favourite spot.  Everything here is delicious.  Jerk chicken,  oxtail,  curry chicken,  rice n peas,  coleslaw...  All good."}
{"text":"I Work Across The Street and try to visit this joint every chance i get and the food here is AMAZING! If your looking for a great eating experience at a wonderful Jamaican Cuisine Then this is your spot! Defiantly worth the price. And the staff there are great!"}
{"text":"Authentic, reasonable price and straight up the best West Indian food in the city!!! I'm addicted."}
{"text":"Whoa, this is the best Jamaican food I've had in Toronto. Every dish is made to order -no steam table here.  The authentic menu rotates daily. Saturday breakfast is a special treat. Be sure to try the Mannish Water and the Curried Goat. The service could not be friendlier. This is the 3rd location for Beryl's Pepper Pot (also in Ajax and Oshawa). A great addition to the interesting regional cuisines to be found in The Beaches. I could eat here every week, it's that good."}
{"text":"Grabbed myself a quick bite just to tide me over until dinner so I ordered festival and oxtail gravy.  Festival was a generous portion that was made to order so it was very fresh.  Was a little bit on the dry side but it had a really nice crisp to it.  I'd still order this again, though.  4/5.  Oxtail gravy was absolutely delicious that it's making me eager to try their actual oxtail dish.  Fingers crossed that it will be a generous and hearty portion.  5/5."}
{"text":"Amazing, authentic Jamaican food. I found out about this place by asking my friend who's from Jamaica, where is there a GOOD place around here for oxtail? She pointed me here and I've never been disappointed! The only negative is that eventually you've eaten all of your food (it's a huge portion) but you still want more!"}
{"text":"Yummy and flavourful!  Our server was a sweetheart. Glad we took a risk on a new place (for us) when it was our turn to pick."}
{"text":"Excellent, definitely going back! Coconut shrimp was absolutely fantastic! The curry goat was one of the best meals I've ever had. Jerk chicken and pork were good."}
{"text":"My business partner and I stopped in for lunch. We walked over to the dine in side and no one was around to seat us, so we thought we had to order at the take out side. We ordered and the girl at the cash didn't give us an option. So we took our food and sat in the dining. My partner got up to get us some drinks and a server finally came and politely told me we were not supposed to eat in the dining if we took out. I explained what had happened and she was nice enough to let us stay. When my partner came back he said the girl at the cash said the same thing to him. We were halfway through our meal so we continued as the server said it was fine. THEN a chef and another employee came from the back and told us we had to leave again. We understood that they want to keep a certain atmosphere in the sit down area, but there were only 2 other guys in the restaurant who even spoke up for us and said they don't mind us eating there, but they still insisted we leave. I've never had anything like that happen before, and this is definitely not how you keep customers coming back. Food was decent, but service was abysmal. Would not recommend"}
{"text":"Soup is great, curry is neon yellow, and the special is scanty.  Overall, it does the job and the soup is great."}
{"text":"Great service, good food for an affordable price.  And always has ripe fried plantain which is a big plus for me."}
{"text":"I dream about the gravy here!!! It's spicy and so full of flavour. I crave it often, and wish I could buy boatloads of it to take home so that I can eat it with everything. I've actually bought a side of gravy to bring home for this purpose; next time I'll buy the largest container they are willing to sell me.  I've been here a few times and I've tried the Jerk Chicken and the Curry Goat. They were both delicious, but I'm partial to the Jerk Chicken because of the yummy gravy that is served with it. The chicken was not dry in the least bit, as I find some jerk chicken can be, and it is served with rice and peas, which is also so good!  The lady who works here is super nice and friendly, and judging by the clientele, the food is very authentic.   And OMG! Did I mention the gravy?!?"}
{"text":"My old review of this place was good as I had a pleasant experience, and we've had a few enjoyable dinners from here since.  Tonight however has made me decide to never go back.  They were rude To my husband when he asked if he could purchase extra coleslaw. He was told no he would only get one per meal ordered....but it's on your menu as an extra side dish... we wanted to pay for it???   They are always out of dumplings and festivals which is very disappointing and today one of their feature items was the Fried Chicken and guess what, they were out. You need to have food available for your customers in order for them to want to come back. Thanks for an unpleasant experience, due to your lack of accommodation, poor customer service and lack of food supply, we will not be returning.    (Old review)Just got to try this place tonight. Very nice decor inside. We got take out this time around but will be back for dine in as the menu has more selection.   We tried the jerk pork with rice and peas and the ox tail. The pork was cooked perfectly with a nice charred outside and tender melt in your mouth meat inside. Added some jerk gravy which is quite spicy but full of flavour. We wanted a side of ox tail gravy for our rice but they were out which is unfortunate. The ox tail was really good and tender and the gravy on the meat was delightful, wish we had more!  The coleslaw was simple but perfect for cooling your mouth following the jerk spices. We will be back for sure, glad this place opened up for some more variety in Pickering."}
{"text":"Having never had jerk chicken before, I was excited to try this restaurant when it opened in Pickering.  We came here on a weeknight for dinner and there were a few people here. You can either dine in or take out. We chose to dine in and although the service was great, I felt that there was a little bit of a disconnect between the type of restaurant, the décor and the table linens.  I think the restaurant was designed mostly for takeaway and there is a long hallway where guests can queue while waiting to place their orders. The dining area is modern and sleek but I was a surprised to see cloth napkins with flatware on our table. It seemed a little too... fancy(?).  Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining, it just felt a little... off.  I ordered the jerk chicken and my husband went with the curry goat. Both dishes were fantastic and I would definitely get the jerk chicken again. Like I mentioned before, I have never had it before so I don't really have anything to compare it to but it sure was good and with just the right amount of kick!  I will absolutely be back to try other items from their menu! The food was great, the service was great and they are a nice addition to our city."}
{"text":"Food is expensive...Food is tasty...Good to eat when you are hungry and don't mind the high calories."}
{"text":"Best Caribbean food anywhere. Jerk chicken Roti Fry Chicken Large portions delicious food. Its my goto for Caribbean"}
{"text":"The worst jerk pork ever! At least 3/4 of the serving was fat after asking for lean. Blamed the supply for giving them fat pork. You can't blame the supplier if that what you except. Took it back after being hung up on. They changed it up for another serving of what I still consider fatty! Like I'm going to eat it after complaining. Hmmmmm special sauce for this one. Go to Jerk King at Kingston Road and Morningside. Don't even have to ask for lean there. The meat I did receive was course! They don't deserve a star!"}
{"text":"Some friends of mine wanted to try Beryl's so I tagged along with them. Third visit in ten days. Hey, I like their food.  With five of us, we ordered a variety of dishes. We started with the Ackee and Saltfish Spring Rolls, Saltfish Fritters, and Red Peas Soup (of the day). They were all good, especially the ackee spring rolls. There was a generous amount of tasty filling. The fritters could have used a little more saltfish (and maybe another fritter).  On to the mains. The Curry Goat and Oxtail were as good as on my previous visits. Consistency is a good thing.  The Escoveitch Red Snapper was served whole, with rice and peas and coleslaw. It was the prettiest dish of the evening, very colourful with pickled peppers. It tasted good and was also a good portion because some of it ended up in a takeout box.  The fried chicken was crispy and I was offered a choice of gravy for the rice and peas. I chose oxtail gravy. Good choice! The chicken, however, was a little on the dry side.  One friend enjoyed the red peas soup so much, he ordered another bowl for his main course.  For dessert, we had Rum and Raisin ice cream and a very generous slice of Sweet Potato Pudding that we shared. Very good on both counts. We were very happy with the taste of all the food.  The service (attentiveness) has definitely improved since my first visit. Our appetizers came out fairly quickly but the mains took a little while and the food temperature could have been hotter. They did have a full dining room and a steady flow of customers at the takeout counter but that shouldn't affect our orders.  The menu is a little confusing. Some items had a choice of preparation listed under it that may get missed. For example, under Whole Red Snapper, there is a choice of Escovietch, Brown Stew or Steamed Fish, in a smaller font. Under Chicken Breast, there is a choice of Jerk, Stew or Island Style Fried Chicken. I actually got thighs (which I preferred).  Chef Beryl visited our table to say hello and get some feedback. I like that touch.  Disclaimer: Three reviews in ten days may seem unusual. For the record, I have no affiliation with this restaurant, their ownership, or employees. I simply like their food and their location is very convenient for me."}
{"text":"The BEST roti texture, moist but not wet. If you want to indulge the sweet potato jerk chicken poutine tastes as yummy as it sounds. I would recommend sharing both the poutine and roti as the servings are HUGE."}
{"text":"First time here and we ate in, and it was amazing. So amazing in fact we decided to order ahead of time for take out about a week later.  Total letdown, my chicken roti was totally undercooked. Prob never hit this spot up again just cuz I am totally grossed out by the undercooked meat #puke"}
{"text":"Bright 28 seat dining room is very quiet on Sunday afternoon. I. Hope they get busier!  We've only eaten at the Ajax location (without a baby) and was thrilled to see them open up a location in Pickering.  Although the restaurant seemed pretty minimal, it serves the general purpose of expansion and actually having sit down resto.    We ate in on a very quiet Sunday afternoon and the quiet dining room hosted just one other family who were equally enamored with Beryl's food.  We had some goat curry and fried chicken (dark meat so my daughter could partake).  The curry dish was just as good as I remembered from my first visit to Beryl's and the fried chicken was well received by my toddler.     The service is efficient but slow (if that makes sense).  I'm not sure if I would return to dine-in but I'm sure happy that there will be a closer take out location for Beryl's excellent offerings."}
{"text":"My favourite jerk spot in the city (so far!). Yummy, yummy food; large enough portions that I can usually get two good-sized meals out of an order, and service is fast and friendly. My only complaint is that it's closed on Sundays. :)"}
{"text":"Great jerk and good service, the dine in menu prices are higher than take out, wish there was a place to eat for take out side."}
{"text":"We checked this out on this past weekend.  It was a Saturday but we went early (5pm) and got a table with no problem.  The place is nice, new but a bit stark, they need some art on the walls. We ordered the salt fish fritters and the coconut shrimp both were really tasty and came with some awesome dipping sauce, it was so good stuck my fork in it and eat the rest of the sauce on its own!! My husband ordered the jerk pork with rice and beans and coleslaw, I ordered the chicken roti.  We both cleaned our plates!! The portions were large, amazingly seasoned and of really high quality.   The service was a bit slow, but really not a problem when the food looks, tastes and smells so amazing.  No more driving out to Scarborough for my Jamaican fix, this is my spot now!  I just hope that they stay consistent. Prices were not bad, we paid about 50 bucks with tax and tips for two drinks, two app's and two entries. The portions were HUGE so be prepared to take some home for the next day. Check them out you will not be disappointed! Good for kids too as I noticed that they had a kids menu."}
{"text":"I really like both their curry chicken and their jerk chicken. Their service is fast and the price was reasonable as well. All in all, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good place to grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"Tried their curry goat and jerk chicken. Love them!  The festivals (side dish)  is also very good. The jerk sauce is peppery and spicy. For those spice lovers, you will like the jerk sauce. The only thing is its more like gravy texture than liquid. Personally I like the gravy consistency."}
{"text":"It was ok the food is just like any other jerk spot I have been! It was pricy for the amount of food I got I mean I order a reg jerk chicken with steam veggies and I got a small container of veggies and 2 small pieces of chicken not worth it at all! I dont think I will be back again!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, went there last weekend for breakfast, found a sticker in my food.. I called them and they said I could get a refund. When I returned the owner came to speak to me and she was very rude... she needs some training in customer service... will never return... she acted as though I should have kept the food even with the sticker and no apology!"}
{"text":"I made two visits to this restaurant today - first and last. I've only tried the jerk pork but it was terrible.  There was no kick to the jerk, it was mostly fat.  The rice was somewhat sweet and wasn't brown or packed with beans. I wouldn't recommend.  Real jerk is still a better option in the hood."}
{"text":"I currently live in the United States but I am in Toronto quite frequently. Whenever I come, I always come to Beryl's Pepperpot. My boyfriend Joseph and I always get the Chicken Roti and Jerk Poutine. Shanell, I believe, is always so gracious and remembers our order every time. Thank you all for your wonderful service here. We will be back a hundred times more."}
{"text":"I went into buy my favorite Caribbean dish  (oxtail) and xould wait to get home to eat it. I live in scarborough so Pickering is quite the distance.  I get home o anxiously open my container and tale a bite. This was the Worst! And i mean worst oxtail i ever had. The meat was hard and nowhwre near fall off the bone. The food was taste less ans needless to say i threw ir right in the garbage. Worst thing is i bought 2. 1 for my husband and one for me..so wasted 30 dollars. How dare you charge 30 for trash food. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE. RITZ IS AMAZING GO THERE. i called to complain and i was told xome in we will refund your money. Very very turned off!!!"}
{"text":"Wish I could have taken a picture but before I knew it, I had already finished my jerk chicken meal. It was delicious. I'd recommend this place to anyone in the area. You can dine in or take out which is nice. The staff is friendly."}
{"text":"So excited to see this place open! Finally a good jerk chicken restaurant in Pickering! The restaurant is split into two areas - one side for dine in and the other side for take out. I have to admit for a dine in Jerk Chicken place it's far more upscale than others I've been to.   I was here for take out  though and at 3pm in the afternoon there was a line up at the take out counter so I take that as a good sign seeing as they just opened 2 days ago. The menu is projected on flat screens above the counter. After placing your order and paying you are giving a receipt with your order number on it. They call your when it's ready.  Dinners come in two sizes  served with coleslaw and you have a choice of either white rice or rice and peas. I ordered two large jerk chicken dinners with rice and peas with oxtail gravy and one large jerk pork with rice and peas oxtail gravy. As listed on the menu they charge a dollar extra for gravy but on my bill there was no charge so maybe it's changed?  Large Jerk Chicken with rice and peas with oxtail gravy - The container was quite large and I'd say a pretty hearty portion of rice for a large. The large comes with 3 pieces of chicken (dark meat) basically a leg with the back cut into 3 pieces. Truth be told I was hoping for 4 pieces of meat in such a large container. The chicken however was cooked to perfection, still juicy with that nice roasty jerk flavour permeating right through the meat from the skin to the bone. I loved the peas and rice good flavour but the oxtail gravy is really what made the rice. So rich in flavour with bits a meat streaked through and plump butter beans.   Large Jerk Pork with rice and peas and oxtail gravy - The pork also had that great roasty jerk flavour and the meat had a beautiful brown crust encasing the juicy white meat. Sometimes you find jerk pork cut too thin and dry but they did theres perfectly. Oh and they definitely didn't skimp on the meat, a hearty portion of sliced pork completely covered the rice.  Overall I'd say I'll definitely be returning here frequently to get my jerk chicken fix! Service was fast maybe 10 minutes despite being busy and preparing fresh to order. I'll be back to check out there other menu items like oxtail and fried chicken as well.  FYI dine in menu has more choices than take out men"}
