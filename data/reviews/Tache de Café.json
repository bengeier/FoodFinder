They didn't make it.  It closed a little while a go.  Too bad.

--------------------------------


Trendy cafe that opened last Summer on Decarie not too far from CÃ´te-Vertu.

Decor is gorgeous. Multiple tables on 2 levels with free wi-fi and flat screen TV.  They also have an outdoor terrace with half a dozen tables open when the weather allows.

They offer mostly coffee (including a very good ice cappuccino) and ice cream.  They also serve simple breakfasts,  lunches (mostly sandwiches and salads) and pastries.   

I find their coffee good but nothing exceptional. It was however picked as one of the 10 best coffee cup in Montreal by LaPresse in Fall of 2011.

The exceptional offering there are the ice cream, frozen yogurts and sorbets.  One of the owners is a formally trained chef and he makes some of the most interesting flavours I've ever tasted.  Aside from the usual ones they offer flavours such as cinnamon, saffron, cardamom, and mint.  You are encouraged to combine them and create your own ice cream ''dish''.  They also started baking some delicious pastries on premise.  I had the best raspberry scone I ever ate at Tache.

It's a great place to just relax and enjoy a coffee or a treat with friends."}

{"text":"Passed by this place a few times and noticed how cute the place looked. I decided to venture in on a warm day and noticed they had ice cream/gelato/yogurt. Turns out it is HOMEMADE, from scratch! (milk, eggs, etc) The shopkeeper was very generous and let my boyfriend and I try basically all the flavors. The strawberry yogurt was fresh, smooth, and unlike other yogurt places like Yeh (they taste more like ice than anything in my opinion), the cookie dough was so rich! We decided to take a small and they fit two flavors in it and boy did they give big portions for a small. I honestly love this place for their homemade ice creams. I came a second time to have the hazelnut flavor, I have yet to try their coffees and pastries, but I think I'm more interested in their cold desserts...Anyway worth checking out on a hot day if you're in St. Laurent."}
