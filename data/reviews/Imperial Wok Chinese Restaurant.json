{"text":"We chanced across the Imperial Wok while looking for another Chinese buffet in the neighborhood.  As you've no doubt noted, the reviews are on this place are pretty mixed, as are my feelings about the place.

Firstly, it was clean and attractive inside.  No need to fear that the chef is dissecting cats in the back or anything like that.  I liked one of my fellow reviewer's description of it looking like something out of Star Trek's DS9, although I thought that the reviewer who described it as a PF Chang's wannabe was more on the nose.  It definitely has a modern \"Chinesy\" flair, without being tacky.

When we arrived at about 1:45 p.m. on a Saturday, there were still about 10 lunch tables occupied.

We decided to try a few of our usual \"test dishes\" that we rely on at American Chinese restaurants.  My partner had the hot and sour soup, which he found quite good, and that's a real compliment coming from him.  I had the vegetarian spring rolls, which weren't quite as good as I'd hoped.  They appeared to be freshly made, not a box of frozen pieces from La Choy or something like that.  What I didn't like about them was that they were terribly bland; it was a tightly bound bunch of blanched cabbage and carrots, with a few mushroom bits.  It was lacking the usual binders of vermicelli or egg that help add texture and flavor.  Even the dipping sauce was bland - sort of a runny peach or apricot sauce, with no acidity or kick.

We also ordered the 'General Taos' chicken; most places call this General Tso's chicken, but given that it's not a real Chinese dish, I don't think it matters.  While it was good, it was not made similarly to what one usually finds.  This was not battered and fried with a sauce, rather it appeared to be lightly breaded white meat, with a lighter, completely non-spicy sauce over it, along with baby corn, green bell pepper & mushrooms.  It was tasty, but not what was expected.

We also ordered the 'Szeschwan eggplant\" which was supposed to be spicy and garlicky, but was neither.  It's served in the usual brownish colored sauce, but this version included a good portion of snow pea pods.  The pea pods were nice and crunchy, but overall the dish failed to be at all Schezwan style, which usually indicates spicy and peppery.

Perhaps the best dish of lunch was the 'Hong Kong style beef chow fun.'  I don't know what kind of noodles they used for this, but they were very wide, and the beef was really tasty too.  It was pretty much just flavored with soy sauce, and could have used a few more nuanced flavors, but if I were to ever return here (not likely) I would definitely order it again.

In all frankness, this is a Chinese restaurant for the suburban, White, Midwestern set, and I think the owner (who I saw was Chinese) is playing to his base.  Service was just okay, but I noticed at least one table of regulars who were very friendly with the staff.  Also, it seems to be a place that does a pretty good bar-service, becayse there were a lot of tiki glasses and red drinks with umbrellas being consumed.  The atmosphere, with the nifty decor and a sound track of jazz standards, was very pleasant and the booth we sat at was comfortable.

You probably won't have a bad meal here, but if you think the food is great, then you'll probably think that Applebee's is a great neighborhood bistro as well. I would like to give this place three stars out of five because I think it merits a solid 70 out of 100, but because three stars = \"A Okay\" I can't do that in good conscious."}
{"text":"I am really not a fan of Imperial Wok anymore, it seems like their food and their service was a lot better before they moved to this new location. Something about the whole atmosphere in there, although it is nice decor it just doesn't feel good in there, something about it makes me feel not welcome and it could have to do with some unfriendly staff.   My husband and I went there last night and the unfriendly man who is always at the door seated us, he put us in one of those big booths in the middle, we asked if we could sit in a booth by the window because the lights were so bright at that table he originally seated us at, he seemed very irritated that we asked for a booth by the window which there were at least 5 open there and he asked us if we would like a table and we said no that we would like to sit in a booth by the window and I even pointed to the one we wanted to sit at and he took us to a different one instead with an attitude. A few times before when we ate here the same man always seemed kind of unfriendly but just thought he was having a bad day, it is now confirmed after visiting last night that he really isn't very nice and probably should be in the back cleaning the toilets instead of being anywhere near the public.  The food is just ok....I keep thinking whenever we decide to Eat there again that it will be better the next time and it never is.  I do like the won ton soup but that is about it, but we will not go there again"}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time yesterday and ordered the Chicken Lettuce Wraps and Shrimp Spring Egg Roll. The service was quick and the staff was friendly. The food was amazing. The egg rolls were made with fresh ingredients. Some places have \"frozen\" egg rolls they fry.... Not the case here. I arrived around 3:30pm on a Tuesday and they had no crowd so that might have added to the swift service."}
{"text":"Tried this place z times since my first review... Still bad... Red Bowl on miles is way better... Our hunan by the falls.. I'll never easy here again!"}
{"text":"We had the best service tonight I can remember from any place I've eaten recently. Fast, attentive, she asked questions and didn't just make assumptions about what we'd want. And the food was delicious. Even my nine year old who never likes anything ate a ton tonight. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We hunted high and low for a good Chinese restaurant after we moved to NE Ohio from Washington DC a few years ago.  We have found it!  Their Hot & Sour Soup is the best I've ever had.  I have never been disappointed in their appetizers or entrees.  Parking is plentiful, ambience much better than most Chinese places I've been in. I recommend the Pineapple Chicken, Shrimp and Walnuts, egg and spring rolls, and egg foo young.  Servers are friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Meh, nothing really exciting. 
Food was fine, nothing to rave about.  Decor is cool I guess.  But they really rush you out.  3 stars seems fair since you can't put 2.5"}
{"text":"The best sushi in town. Chinese is great too. Fresh high quality ingredients make this a simple choice. I've  probably had over 50 meals here and have never been disappointed. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I worked here for four years in the early 2000s and I ate this food EVERY day and never got sick of it.  And I was vegan for part of the time.  I haven't tried the egg rolls that everyone is talking about but everyone did order them.  My favorite dishes have to be their ho fun and singapore style noodles.  Walnut shrimp or chicken (if you like mayo) are also really good.  I can't think of anything bad on the menu. I don't remember their drinks being weak either.  If you think they're weak, you should try a \"zombie,\" it's pure alcohol.  I haven't tried the sushi at the new location though (their move was after my time) so I can't speak about that.  I have tried food at the new location (Szechuan eggplant) and it was very good.  The food is similar to Empress Court in Bainbridge which is one of my favorite places."}
{"text":"I am surprised at the number of lukewarm and lesser reviews. We order carry out from here once a month at least. Food is very good, orders are accurate, portions are huge. Great variety. Best Chinese in the Chagrin Valley including the overrated Hunan by the Falls in CF and other Hunan by the Theatre in Solon. I travel for a living and eat lots of Chinese everywhere. Imperial Wok is better than 9 out of 10 places I visit. Not world class NYC caliber Chinese food, but very good, fairly priced dinner. I have not dined in the restaurant, carry out customer exclusively. A safe bet for a good dinner or lunch."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite Chinese place!! The staff is super friendly, and the food is hot and fresh!! Their restaurant is super clean too. Their cashew chicken is amazing!! Would give them 100 stars if I could!"}
{"text":"I so want to like Imperial Wok - it's close, it looks good, but after multiple visits over the past several years, I have to say I think I'm done going there.   I've ordered a wide variety of items from their menu, hoping to find one of the things to which people refer when giving them good reviews.   I've never had anything from there that wasn't just \"meh\".  Rice dishes, noodle dishes, chicken dishes - never seems to matter.  It's generally cooked well and presented nicely - but the taste always seems to be lacking.  It's as though no spices or seasonings ever get added to the dishes.   This past weekend, we got Lo mein noodles, fried rice, and Kun Bao chicken for takeout.   Got home, tried a little of each dish and, as with every visit in the past, everything seemed so bland.   

On the up-side, the place is very nice.  We've eaten in the restaurant a few times and had takeout a few more times over the past few years, but the food uniformly seems to be lacking and that's really too bad.  It is close by and other people seem to like it, but I will have to travel further away to get Chinese food with some flavor."}
{"text":"Overall the food is pretty good.  We visit alot and for the most part are treated very well.  There is one older lady who isnt very nice will seating you.  5 stars?? Probably not, but a great place to go for a quick chinese meal that keeps you full."}
{"text":"Best hot and sour soup I have ever had. I also had the Wonderful Shrimp and Scallops and completely enjoyed it. The serving could feed 2 people. The decor was beautiful."}
{"text":"Total rip-off. I ordered a large Chicken Fried Rice. It cost $9. There was barely any chicken in it, a couple scallions and a few tiny pieces of egg. I asked for no  bean sprouts , but extra egg (since I wasn't getting the sprouts that I was paying for) and not only were there no \"extra\" but there were barely any eggs at all.  I basically paid $9 for a container of plain rice. When I asked for extra soy cause to take home I was told it would cost me $1 more for a few extra packs of soy sauce! PURE GREED at its best. I definitely WOULD NOT recommend this place."}
{"text":"I work in solon and this is a standard lunch spot. Sushi is good and i order raw fish rolls.  Chinese plates are hit and miss - some
are saltier than i prefer. We order some dishes with \"no msg added\" to cut down our salt content. Good service and a nice experience. It is clean and enjoyable. It is not 5 stars because ive had a couple of \"misses\" with the chinese plates."}
{"text":"Pretty great sushi. Have not tried their hot food yet, but plan on it. A little pricey, but you get a lot for your money. Parking is a little funky. Note no sushi on Mondays. I'm not counting that against them too much though, it was me who didn't read the take out menu clearly."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. Almost as fantastic as our waitress Liz.  I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"We've been looking for a really good chinese restaurant for a long time and this is it, but it's on the other side of town!  Food was excellent! Everyone was so nice."}
{"text":"Imperial Wok is a locally owned, family operation. The owners are on site often and picky about the service, food, and delight of their guests.  

The restaurant moved in December to its new, more visible, corner location. The presentation inside is a very contemporary, fun atmosphere featuring neat lighting, contemporary cultural art/ decor and even a cool waterfall fixture as you enter.  There is plenty of parking.  The sushi bar is new and is a new personal favorite.  

There was clearly a learning curve for the staff when it re-opened in January, which made for long waits.  The newness has worn off for the most part and has since staffed up to accommodate its popularity among locals.   It is a great place for drinks in a comfortable, cool  bar area, unlike its old location.  

The menu has not changed much with the move.  There is nothing fancy about the food presentation which has never been a notable thing of imperial wok.   Portions are still decently sized, and always served hot.  Prices are typical and balanced with the overall value."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with high quality food.  Egg Rolls are the best ever.  Pressed duck is original and very tasty."}
{"text":"If you eat fast food or don't mind generic food this is a good place to go. If you are looking for something better, Imperial Wok is not one of them. Interior and service are decent, but the food I would give one star. My crispy duck was so bad that I am not sure I will ever try to order it even in other places.  Avoid!"}
{"text":"Nice portion sizes and delicious food. I had General Tao's chicken with brown rice....yum"}
{"text":"Love the food but I'm afraid of the waitresses. So unfriendly. I always feel like
I'm bothering them, maybe because they're usually walking away while I'm still ordering. I really like their food so I just try to order really fast and then apologize for bothering them."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened at Imperial Work.....new cooks, ownership, etc... Have not had he same quality as at their old location. But, the food we ordered as take-out was not good at all. The sauce had little flavor and was as thin as water. It was supposed to be a spicy dish and was so bland, lacked flavor. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I have not visited here in many years ( my loss) last time time I ate at Imperial it was at their old location. Well it is as good as I remember , very good ! Started with the PuPu platter not same presentation as in years past but just as good. Their made in house egg rolls are delicious ! ( mustard very hot and good!) for nostalgia reasons I ordered the Moo Goo Gai Pan and it was outstanding ( just as I remember. ) also ordered the Hunan Noodle - top notch !  The only gripe would be that they need more hot pepper seeds in their hot oil. Overall great dining experience with friendly staff and owner .

Will Be Back !!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best chinese restaurant around.  Our family dines here at least once a month - maybe more and our co-workers order lunch take out from here a few times a month.  The food is absolutely delicious.  I have never had a bad or disappointing dish ever.  The atmosphere is beautiful, the service is wonderful and the food is amazing.  I highly recommend getting the dinner for 2, 3, 4 etc. depending on how many people you have with you when dining in.  It is worth it. I am not the only person who feels this way about the Imperial Wok - I know numerous people who LOVE it.  This is the place for me and my family.  EVERYTHING is excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Imagine having a tall stack of Oreo cookies and only a drop of milk. How about a plate of buffalo wings and just a teaspoon of blue cheese to cool it down.  Peanut butter, no jelly...ham, no burger....ahem...you get the the drift. I ordered Pork Egg Foo Yong with fried rice. I got 3 huge patties and a 'lil bowl of rice.  Come on man!  Half way through the 1st patty I was out, so I asked our waitress for more rice and she said, \"$2.50 for more\".  

By the time I finished my 2nd patty, the remaining gravy began to coagulate in the serving plate into a gelatinous brownish yellow goop.  I'm not gonna lie though, it was good and I even finished left overs for breakfast the next morning.  The gravy regained its intended consistency after nuking it in the microwave for a few minutes.

Bottom Line: Overpriced; Decent Quality; Chincy with the rice"}
{"text":"Very clean restaurant, quick service. The food itself is usually pretty good. However, like most Americanized Chinese, the food tends to be pretty salty. I would recommend ordering the brown or white rice over the fried rice, if anything to balance out some of the salt. My favorite dishes from here are the broccoli chicken, orange chicken (spicy), and the sesame chicken!"}
{"text":"My fav Chinese restaurant.
Rich always takes care of my needs and is a pleasure to chat with.
You cannot go wrong with this establishment. Been around over 30 years."}
{"text":"I love checking out local Chinese restaurants in small towns when I drive cross country.  I ordered the Beijing steak tonight and it was horrible!!  1) big pieces of \"steak\" was breaded and deep fried and then drenched in a sweet and sour brown sauce.  Disgusting!  Why would anyone bread and deep fry beef?????  Was it really that bad quality of beef?  AND the description did not say so!  The description also read the dish was served with steamed broccoli.  There were only about four small pieces of broccoli and they were wilted and old--NOT freshly steamed.  To add to this--I did not even get any utensils in my takeout bag.  I can't speak for the other items at this restaurant, but I would suggest avoiding this dish."}
{"text":"Not bad Chinese food for this area.  Pretty large portions, and well priced.  Food is up quick and it's hot. The menu gives you a good variety."}
{"text":"Decor - the seating area and the restroom were maintained well. I liked the design of the restaurant itself with creative doorway designs and wall mounted installations. 

Food - I enjoyed both my appetizer and my entree of Sweet Potato Sushi and Imperial Tofu, respectively. Both of the dishes tasted fresh and made to order. The sweet potato sushi was surprisingly tasty due to the balance of fried sweet potato and the sweet sauce at the bottom. The Imperial Tofu was flavorful and piping hot, when it came to the table. The tofu was delicately fried and literally melted in my mouth, which is hard to get. However I felt that the carrots were a tad undercooked and the cloud ears (type of fungi) didn't really add much to the overall dish. I do appreciate the chef in trying to incorporate such uncommon ingredients. Overall, I enjoyed my meal.

Service - My waiter was very attentive of beverage refills and bringing out the food. He was friendly and helpful in navigating the menu and options for dietary restrictions. 

Overall - Food was fresh, service was good and it was a pleasant evening. I would visit this place again."}
{"text":"We had a pleasant experience at the Imperial Wok.  This was our  first time here.   The ownership has been the same for the last 30 years by the way. We were very pleased with the service and the food.  I had moo gai pan and it was delicious.  The won ton soup was great as well.  This will now be my go to place for Chinese food."}
{"text":"Such a great experience tonight.  The first time we've been to this restaurant, the manager seated us and was so attentive to our questions, recommended some great options.  The food was fresh and well prepared.  Sweet and sour sauce right on the table to use as we pleased .  We chose the family meal and had an amazing appetizer plate, very large bowls of soup (they accommodated my unique preference for 50:50
Egg Drop and Hot & Sour, then two entrees
of Mu Goo Gai Pan and Moo Shu Pork with rice pancakes.  I had a Mai Tai - yum and my hubby had Hot Sake!"}
{"text":"I go here often as I live only about 5 minutes away and it has stayed one of my favorite restaurants for many years. The food and service is usually quick and friendly and their food is my favorite Americanized Chinese food. 5 stars"}
{"text":"We're new in Twinsburg,OH. Checking-out Chinese restaurants in the area. We ordered carry-out, over-all, food are bland, lack of taste. Menu offerings are good."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to check out the \"new\" Imperial Wok last week. We are die hard Hunan of Solon fans, but were curious to check out the new location. At first glance you may be impressed with the remodel, but by the end of the meal you realize that all Imperial Wok did was try to turn an old Rockne's into a PF Chang's knockoff. We were sat at a two person table so close to the next one that I could smell the garlic on my neighbors breath. This type of seating may be acceptable for trendy restaurants in Tremont, but not for a family Chinese joint trying their hand at fancy. The wait staff was inconsistent; our server was quite slow and we sat for about ten minutes before she took even our drink order. However the server for the couple next to us seemed to come over and ask how everything was after every bite they took. I'm not sure which one of us had the better deal. I ordered the pot stickers and pineapple chicken. My boyfriend ordered the Mongolian beef. The pot stickers were just ok, and the dipping sauce that came with them was just soy sauce poured into a dish. The pineapple chicken was bland, and the sauce was really starchy. It basically tasted like they mixed a can of Dole pineapple with corn syrup and poured it over some friend chicken pieces. My boyfriend was immediately turned off by the Mongolian beef because it came out with mushrooms in it. Mongolian beef should never have mushrooms in it, and since my boyfriend is Taiwanese and his parents owned a Chinese restaurant while growing up, I consider him an expert on the subject. 
To top it all off, I used the restroom on our way out of the restaurant and the women's room was absolutely disgusting. One toilet was clogged completely and the other stall had toilet paper all over the floor. Then of course there were no paper towels when I went to wash my hands, and I had to walk to the host stand with dripping hands while they looked for something for my to dry them with. 
Bottom line, don't waste your money here. If you would like a quality Chinese meal from a Solon establishment, try Hunan of Solon."}
{"text":"Absolute favorite Chinese restaurant in Solon. The service is great and the staff is always friendly and welcoming. A couple of my go-to items from the menu are the barbecued spare ribs, beef and broccoli, orange chicken, and the geisha roll. I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Perhaps, there is a newer chef at the Imperial Wok. The food does not taste as good anymore. We tried all Chinese restaurants in Solon and we can't be spending money at the Imperial Wok anymore on something that's not worth it."}
{"text":"Your fairly typical strip mall fare.  It yearns to be more but its just not happening.  Good for the quick turn around lunch and above average egg drop soup.  Ive been here several times and the food is generally bland but in very nice sized portions.

Save your $$ if you're looking for a unique Asian food experience.  But if you're looking for something quick and average - youve found the place."}
{"text":"I have been going to this Chinese restaurant for as long as I can remember, in fact it is the only Chinese food I will eat! The higher price of their food correlates with their large portions, quick service, and friendly environment. I have been going to this restaurant since they were in their old location and stuck by them during their move to their new location. The quality of their food remained the same from the old restaurant to the new restaurant, which was very pleasing. I have no complaints about this restaurant, and will always be a frequent and life long customer."}
{"text":"I've been enjoying the food of Imperial Wok for the last 20+ years (as a 33 year old). I've lived all over the country and eaten at many Chinese restaurants, but for the price and quality you can't beat this place. The owners and staff are never anything but nice and helpful, whether we are dining in or getting a to go order. I could not recommend this lovely local establishment more!"}
{"text":"Honestly a sub-par Chinese food place. If you want good Chinese food go to Hunan Solon. Don't waste your time or money on this \"garbage\" they call food. The waiters are hostile and clearly get annoyed when you just want water for your beverage. The rice tastes like cardboard."}
{"text":"This is a good basic Chinese restaurant that does Cantonese very well ... Not innovative, but tasty at a good price"}
{"text":"There is no better Chinese food than I-wok.  No question that the egg rolls and mai-tais are the best in the country. If possible, it has only gotten better since the move from the old location.  While there are other good Chinese Restaraunts in the area (Hunan Coventry / Ho Wah) they do not meet the high standards set by I-wok.  If you live in Solon and decide against I-wok, I'll bet you voted for Ed Suit and wish Slam Jams was still in business."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant with several friends on a Friday night.  The restaurant was packed.  The staff was friendly.  The food was not very good.  We ordered several different dishes and most were bland.  The orange chicken did not have even a trace of orange flavor and was extremely salty.  The spring roll was passable, but the other dishes were nothing to brag about.  I will not be going back to this restaurant when there are so many good chinese restaurants in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I want to like this place... I want to be a regular... but we did not get off to a great start at a long tern relationship...

Interior is very clean and in good repair for being at least 5 years old (from the previous reviews on their move) but my spoon had stuck on food and my husband's knife was covered in soap haze.  The waitress ignored the pair of silverware sitting on the edge of the table when she collected the used appetizer dishes. The manager came by at the end of the meal to ask how everything was and she did not notice them either until I pointed them out.  She did apologize... but not a good first impression.

Potstickers - crunchy bottoms but no seasoning on the filling... a few bits of garlic, but no cabbage, onion, ginger... anything... just pork. The ponzu dipping sauce sort of saved the day... but we would not get them again.

Shrimp Toast - nice chunks of shrimp in the schmear... but the bread was SOAKED in grease like a sponge. Also void of seasoning... but no amount of onion and ginger could have saved the mouthful of cold oil from the first bite.

General Tso Chicken - saute'd pieces of white meat... nice to not have breading... the chunks were HUGE... not hard to cut with a butter knife... but really awkward. Broccoli was perfectly steamed, but also really large.

Tiny cup of brown rice was not really even enough for one person... should have ordered a second.

Diverse and large menu... will go back and try other things... but not somewhere we will hang out when making the weekly trip to Market District across the street."}
{"text":"We eat chinese about 3 times a month. We have eaten inside and taken home Imperial Wok food for about 7 years. It seems like something has changed in the past 8-10 months. The food taste is off, very bland and boring. 

Service is great, ambiance is great, portions are perfect, location is great.. it's just the taste. Perhaps a chef changed or an ingredient supplier changed?

We are in the middle order-ers: General Tso's Chicken, Chicken Pad Thai, Cashew Chicken, Orange Chicken, etc..  

I write all this in an effort to fix one of my favorite restaurants. Come-On, take the leash off the chef and bring the flavor back.

Oh and I would be a more frequent customer if you delivered."}
{"text":"Some improvement with the new location. 

We were shocked to find six parking spots sporadically marked as Carry Out parking in the lot.  We were arrogant & selfish, deciding to take one anyways. Go inside to find over a dozen carryout bags on the counter, maybe they do need all that parking after all. 

Enjoyed good service, and good food. On a recent visit our only complaint was a dish that was too large. Try the egg rolls they're perhaps the best in town. 

Still plagued by weak drinks from the bar. Next time I'll stick with water."}
{"text":"What didn't taste funny had no taste.  Used to be better but we were really dissatisfied.  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Typical for the Cleveland area, Chinese cuisine around here is really \"Anglo-Chinese\" and this place is no exception.  By Anglo-Chinese standards the food here is quite good, but unfortunately for Imperial Wok I judge with a palette more accustomed to traditional Chinese cuisine. 

They run a clean operation in a contemporary, upscale setting.  Menu is pretty standard Anglo-Chinese stuff with General Tso's Chicken at the very top.  Speaking of which, Imperial Wok uses some sort of clear, sweet n' sour sauce so red-orange in color that it practically glows in the subdued, nouveau lighting.  Exciting.  Their won tons taste like they came delivered frozen in a big box and not freshly made at all.  Tempting, not.

Now their Hong Kong style Ho Fun is actually quite decent especially because it's hard to find anyone who serves up wide noodles around these parts.  Be careful about asking for this one \"spicy\".

Egg Foo Young?  Meh... whilst not quite the Egg Foo Dung, definitely not something to write to Shanghai about.

Sushi?   Wayyyyy overpriced.  (For better quality, assortment, and price, head to Shinano's just up the road on Miles.)

Personally I find it wrong to combine Chinese and Japanese cuisines under one roof - but that's the traditionalist side of me again.

For true, authentic Chinese cuisine in this area (and for a 100-mile radius) far superior to this place you ought to try Hunan Solon instead which  located only 5 minutes west of Imperial Wok (off 43 on Enterprise Pkwy - see Yelp listing/reviews)."}
{"text":"\"The Wok\" is a great restaurant that also is conveniently located close to where I work. Most of the time, my coworkers and I order carryout and I rarely eat inside. 

Imperial Wok's current location is my official zombie shelter; this is where I would go if the city suddenly was overrun by zombies. The entrance is a large wooden circular door with another set of doors on the inside. There is not one single window in the entire restaurant. They have a bar, which would be used for molotov cocktails for zombie defense, and I am sure they have a fully stocked kitchen to provide for us until the threat was eliminated. 

I am happy that the wok is moving to a new location only a little further down the street. The building they are moving to was an old Rocknies that had a fire of some sort which put them out of business. The wok, from what I hear, is intending to add a sushi bar and maybe a buffet with the space the new location will offer. 

I can't wait to see the changes when they move, but now I will have to rethink about my zombie invasion plans."}
{"text":"New location has interesting decor - inside is like something from Deep Space Nine, complete with a large circular lighted door way into the dining room and some water features, some interesting wall paper patterns, and almost bluish lighting. It's certainly impressive, as is the new sushi bar.

Food was OK. I didn't order my usual Chinese restaurant favorite, and the noodle dish I did get was also like something that'd come from a replicator (perhaps in the first season of TNG where they are still trying to get the recipes right). Bland, almost no seasoning at all. Presentation was attractive but I barely remember what I ordered since it didn't really taste like anything. (note to self: this is a good place to take certain relatives who don't like flavor or spice)

Overall may be a nice place to take clients, since the decor is so impressive and everyone could find something they like. But why not go to Hunan of Solon? So much better!"}
{"text":"I can honestly say I wish I held aside every bad thing I have ever said about any other restaurant for this place's review. This is by far the most vile, disgustingly disturbing, \"food\" I have ever put in my face. 
  Any other Asian restaurant I would eat my full meal as to not disrespect the chief or staff. But here, I could not eat a bite of their disgusting dishes. The sushi is old and dry. The \" cuisines\" are overly salty without a singly hint of flavor,  and once taking a bite I felt it be necessary to induce vomiting for personsl safety.
   The bill was about double and I currently feel as though I have spent the night at Mrs. Robinson's house of pain. The waitress was very sweet but after what they have forced to feed me I cannot even leave 2 stars for such lack of effort. Besides the staff this place has nothing to offer.  You are better off drinking toilet water this to attempt the risk of eating anything at this place. 
   Now if you excuse me, I must get home to induce vomiting.  I hope I make it.."}
{"text":"The only reason this one can last is lack of competition. Service is average. 
Food is like most comments said, \" Anglo Chinese\". But look where you are, right?"}
{"text":"It's a pity that I HAVE to give this 1 star.  It's basically a human gas station serving unappealing, unappetizing and bland food.  The decor is the same.  The hygiene is dubious at best.  Sure, it is cheap and the portion sizes are large but do you really need to fill up so badly?  Never again.  

You work hard for your money.  Spend it at a better place.  It's not hard to do."}
{"text":"Average food. But I like the decor.  Did not have sushi.  It looked good.  Would I be back?  No the is hundreds of places like This.  One has to be better."}
{"text":"Wow, the food is so fresh and delicious.  We wanted to try a variety of dishes so the waitress brought us separate platres and put all the food in the middle.  

We liked the steak on a stick and the cantonese shrimp appetizers the best.  The main dishes said spicy and she asked us if we wanted mild, medium or hot.  It was so nice to order medium and really get a nice spice that we could eat.  I highly recommend General Tso's. Empress chicken, and cashew shirmp.  My daughter ordered the beef pea pod and they don't skimp on the pea pod.

Last i would like to say our server excellent.  The atmosphere was realky great too.We will be back.  Lots of left overs because the portions are big."}
{"text":"About the most family-unfriendly Chinese restaurant I've ever had the displeasure of...NOT dining in.  There was a wait at lunchtime, even though the place has new digs at the corner of Aurora and SOM, with acres of tables.  Apparently, not enough wait-staff though.  The maitre d' (an Anglo) took our name (wife, myself, and baby), and let us wait for 1/2 hour whilst seating other parties who came in behind us. Perturbed, I asked why this was the case, and he said that since we needed a high-chair, only certain tables could accommodate us because the wait staff had to have adequate room to maneuver between the tables.  Would have been nice to know ahead of time, for sure.  Throughout, his attitude was like we weren't even there (again, it's a Chinese place not a French). The baby was getting cranky, wondering (like us) what suckers we were for waiting any longer.  We left w/o eating.  

About the only thing Imperial about this place is the attitude.  Fuhgetaboutit--there's plenty of other choices for Chinese in Solon."}
{"text":"I totally don't get some of the meh reviews on here.
 
They don't do sushi on Mondays, but then again, I don't think their sushi is their strong suit.  Their entrees are always super reliable, and I like that the quality is always consistent... none of that \"we'll see how spicy it is depending who is working the kitchen\" stuff. The pork fried rice is one of my favorites...its basically my personal version of comfort food, and the only Chinese food I actually crave when I have a taste for Chinese food. My other go-tos are the Mixed Nut Kunbow and the Pork Szechuan, and the vegetables are always fresh.

The interior is clean and spacious, and you're never really sure to experience a wait when you're here. They will seat you fast and serve you faster. The ambience is pretty standard. It's not chic enough for a date night, but it will do for dinner with friends or family. They are also usually always ahead of schedule on your takeout order. Its tough to complain about a place that has it together this much... so the next time you need a late night Chinese fix, Imperial Wok will do the trick!"}
{"text":"Better than average Chinese food. Though the prices, for what you get, are on the higher side. So be prepared to spend a little more than you normally would at a Chinese restaurant. The wonton is some of the best I've had and the egg rolls are delicious, but the rest of the meals are just slightly above average. The interior is nice, the restaurant is clean, and there is plenty of parking. They clearly do a lot of takeout at this location. Could be better, but this place hits the spot if you're craving Chinese."}
{"text":"Good price for what you get. Service was a tad slow, however they are super friendly!!
Taste of everything was on point."}
{"text":"Great food every time, service doesn't disappoint, reasonably priced for what you get. Try the shrimp with chinese vegetables."}
{"text":"Very friendly wait staff and decent food."}
{"text":"We've eaten here many times in the nearly ten years we've lived in Solon. We go every Christmas for dinner!  The food and customer service are terrific, and the prices are so reasonable. I love that you can order spicy food at three separate degrees. No complaints ever!"}
{"text":"Good food. Really quick and friendly service. I will definitely be going back. Best Chinese food place we've found so far."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this restaurant on a Saturday afternoon with a friend. We were seated immediately. Our waitress was polite and attentive. We received our appetizers and food quickly. Everything was hot and fresh. Our drinks were made well. The portions are more than enough. I have no complaints.
I would recommend the appetizer of pot stickers and the entree of sesame chicken. The blue Hawaiian (I think that is the name) drink didn't really go with our food but it was still worth it."}
{"text":"I stopped by while enroute to a Dr. appointment and had a late lunch.

Service was quick and the food came out just as fast.  I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai with extra sauce.  It was served fast, hot and delicious!  I only had 3o minutes for lunch and I was able to and not sacrifice quality or service!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here for years, friendly staff and great food. I had schezwan chicken with fried rice, egg roll, won ton soup and some crab Rangoon. More than enough food!!  I hope to get back there when I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"Bad food, worse service.  When I complained that the food tasted off and was served soggy, I was told to pay for it or they would call the police.  The nexy day I had terrible stomach cramps.  Only eat here if you want to get sick and are masochistic enough to want service befitting fast food."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered takeout for dinner and the chicken was raw. I called the owner to complain and she advised me to come into the restaurant next time and order the same exact meal and she would make sure it was right next time. She said she couldn't provide a credit since this was part of a family meal and she was unsure of the credit amount. Shirley said she wasn't sure of any other solution. 

This is a shame since I loved the imperial wok. I've been going there for over 20 years and they lost a good customer. I told the owner that and she said oh well."}
{"text":"The waterfall wall at the entrance may have been my favorite part of eating lunch here. The egg rolls were indeed good. The main dish was not. Co-workers raved about this place. Now that I put this place in my rearview, I can say I will probably never return. If people are talking about coming here again, I may act like I have something to do and can't make it. The dudes I went with were cool, so maybe I would come back just based on the fact that I value interaction with fun people. The food would not be the driving force in this decision. Unless I just ate the egg roll. I prefer Hunan Solon."}
{"text":"I loved the old Imperial Wok, and I love the new one even more. Beautiful decor and very clean. Every time I eat here (once every 2 or 3 months), I have a great meal and service."}
{"text":"First time to the restaurant. It has large selection of dishes and sushi to choose from. I did enjoy the fact that they ask if you want your dish mild, medium or hot. Though I think I will the orange chicken again but as hot instead of medium. It did take a bit of time for service, but we had also ordered a verity of sushi. Totally worth the wait."}
{"text":"We've been to Imperial Wok twice. The food is above average for Chinese restaurants and the decor is sleek, modern and inviting. Service was great on our first visit, but on our second visit, we had to wait rather long for someone to take our order. There seemed to be some confusion over who was supposed to serve our table.

One minor complaint about the booth where we were seated in the dining room on our second visit: there was way too much space between our seats and the table. We had to sit nearly at the edge of the seat in order to eat."}
{"text":"Service today was not that good waitress was moving as if she was running a marathon. She had no personality and it appeared as if the were pushing us out. I will think twice next time."}
{"text":"Very good, for takeout Chinese. I am not a huge fan of Chinese takeout, but this will def be my new go-to.
We had the teriyaki steak appetizer, 4 \"steak-on-a-stick\" pieces. It was exactly like the \"Bali Maki\" at my favorite Chinese place in Cincinnati, Oriental Wok. Delicious...I could make a meal out of those alone. We shared the \"Kung-Bow\" scallops (it is shrimp on the menu, but they told me they would make it with scallops :)) and Pineapple Chicken. I thought it was \"Kung-PAO\" chicken, but whatever. It was good...all of the veggies were chopped up really well, and there were just enough peanuts. And plenty of scallops. The pineapple chicken was awesome....great sauce, chicken was lightly breaded and not deep fried, and the pineapple was perfect."}
{"text":"my sister took mom out for early mothers day and I tagged along. Mom ordered her usual Moo Goo Gai Pan with white meat and Chinese veggies  they forgot the white rice but resolved that problem quickly. My sister ordered the szechwan chicken served with crispy Chinese veggies and she liked the spice.  I decided decided to try the Szechwan string beans and white rice with spicy garlic  great flavor and requested a box and took over 1/2 home. the portions are great giving you enough for a full meal the next day.  I believe they were understaffed as the service was slow. and really only question is why hot tea is $2.00     other than that this is a go to place when in Solon looking for Chinese"}
{"text":"Great value for lunch. The food is good and the service is excellent. We were in and out in a flash, too."}
