{"text":"Cozy, intimate, kitschy decor, excellent food, attentive service."}
{"text":"This place is a joke! I felt like flipping the table after I ate there.  We ordered the supposely famous ceviche, it tastes okay but you can't find a single piece of fish! The seafood pilaf tastes bland but its not worth $40 for the portion they gave to people. The waiter suggested we order a lamb casserole, and it is NOT lamb, it is beef and it's overcooked with funky seasoning. The service is slow and they only have one waitress to look after the entire restaurant.  After 21/2 hrs and a hundred dollars, we came home hungry and had to eat a banana!  This is the place I wish I could throw a chair to the kitchen!"}
{"text":"While the menu sounds interesting, and it fills a culinary niche (South American, regularly with live music), every entree we have had here has been at best passable.  The flavours are never fully developed, leaving you feeling like you are just eating wet pieces of meat.  An attentive chef would make these dishes bolder (even if not authentic) to suit a North American palate, and spend some time on plate presentation.  If this restaurant was not so expensive, I would probably be generous and give it two stars. We have been here several times over the years, and like another reviewer, used Entertainment 2-for-1 coupons.  Even with these coupons, we have stopped going."}
{"text":"There isn't much else in the area which is what got me to try this place but I'm glad I did. The service is great and the atmosphere is really nice with the light music in the background. The portions are reasonable to large and everything is prepared properly. They always take care wit my shellfish allergy and while not having the most varied menu, offer something a little different for NW Calgary. The one thing that lets this place down for me is the desserts. I've tried a number of them and haven't found one I like and to me dessert is the easy part. I would skip that course here but the rest is great. This isn't high end dining but is still a nice evening out.  The d√©cor has been updated since the older reviews were posted. Its quite nice."}
{"text":"I went there on a Friday night with my spouse and we used a groupon. Overall a really great experience.   The atmosphere is so nice, relaxing and romantic.  There was live music and it was such a good addition.   We started with the escargot wich unfortunately was pretty mediocre. But it was all redeemed with the entres.  We had the seafood meddly and the lamb; they were fantastic. Both the squid and the lamb were cooked perfectly.   I will defenatly be returning here to discover what else they have to offer."}
{"text":"I thought the atmosphere was pretty cool. Unfortunately the music was a bit loud making it hard to have a conversation with the other people. It was packed on a Saturday night. The food was great. The soup of the day was super tasty and the bread served was warm and filling. The portions were a good size."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night, thankfully I had made a reservation ahead of time because it was packed! They had a flamenco guitarist playing on a little stage, which definitely helped set the ambiance. Despite being so full the service was quick, and friendly. The food is AMAZING everyone at our table loved their dishes and we all had something different. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because at one point the waitress refilled my husbands wine, and there was something floating in it (which she quickly replaced with a new glass and new wine) and the same waitress spilled a glass of water on the other couple with us (she comped us our desserts because of the accident). That being said she was a great waitress and handled it all really well. We will definitely be going back there."}
{"text":"Went last night for dinner with the family.  Food took forever, entrees took almost 30 min and we were one of the only tables waiting for food.  We ordered mussels for appetizers, which were decent, nothing to special. Entrees we ordered were the  Lamp chops: 3 peices, all too fatty, like chewing bubblegum, rice was nice though. Steak: nothing to special, not as tender as we hoped. Pasta dish: very creamy, chicken was tasty.  Service was decent, did not get quality checked till we were almost done our meals.   Might return, only because i have heard good things from others. Better luck next time."}
{"text":"Our family arrived here on a Sunday at 5 pm(just as the restaurant was opening).  Two servers in training(who had to be reminded to switch on their \"Open\" sign) greeted us.   Both of them were very pleasant and attentive; so I will give the service 4 stars.  The kitchen failed to impress, however.   My son ordered the Caesar salad which was very fresh, crisp and zingy(thankfully with no anchovies in the dressing) but it was a bit heavy on the vinegar side.   Entrees:  Chicken Fettucine in a cream sauce--very flavorful with a mild, spicy kick(from the paprika and black pepper).  My son liked it, though.  The mushrooms, red pepper and broccoli were cooked to tender-crisp(and some of the vegetables were downright raw), so he only ate half.   It was a generous serving of fettucine but not worth $20.95.  Pargo Rojo with Salsa Criolla(Steam pan-fried red snapper with green peppers, onions and tomatoes)--the snapper fillet was perfectly cooked in some parts and overcooked in others.  A small part of it tasted \"fishy\"(which means the dark part near the belly had not been removed).  The Salsa Criolla was very strange.  The quartered tomatoes(I would have preferred them to be seeded and finely chopped)  were sitting on top of a puddle of tomato sauce that had the overpowering taste of white vinegar.  I think this sauce was reponsible in overcooking half of the otherwise perfectly cooked snapper.   The vegetables that came with the dish were undercooked to raw...  Hmmm... crunchy yams are interesting...   You would think it would be easier for the kitchen to place all the veggies with olive oil, salt and cracked pepper on a sheet pan in the convection oven and let everything caramelize for 15 minutes....  Scallops Cartagena--this was my hubby's dish, but I had a little taste.  The caper and fresh coconut sauce worked very well with the scallops.  The scallops were a bit undercooked and looked rather insipid; it might have helped if they'd been seared first(to give it some color and enhance the flavor).     I didn't want to give this harsh a criticque, but if a restaurant claims to be cooking \"fine Latin American cuisine\",  they should pull up their socks and pay more attention to details(both in flavours and plating)."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night with Allie and it was great. Some live music good food and a few martini's. Great combination of flavors and will be back for another meal!"}
{"text":"A - List. Superb food. Excellent wine. Small and cozy. Personalized service. Live music on weekends. The decor is dated. You will either like it and return, put up with it and never come back or ignore it almost completely and enjoy the experience over and over. You get what you pay for...Expen$ive. Use the entertainment book and save."}
{"text":"We were greeted warmly on arrival at the opening time of 5PM, seated at our reserved table, and quickly briefed on the specials. The interior is much as I remembered it from years ago: somewhere on the kitschy-retro spectrum, which adds to the charm if you like that sort of thing. They still feature live flamenco music later in the evening, but we didn't stay this time. Despite the friendliness of the servers, I can't overlook what came out of the kitchen.  I ordered Scallops Cartagena, which arrived in good time, swimming in a thin curry coconut sauce with a side of rice and vegetables. Good portion size, artless plating. The scallops were a tad undercooked, and so were the carrots, which were hard and chewy. Hence, the \"Meh.\" I wanted to write a more positive review after being away so long. Sigh."}
{"text":"Our waitress was very nice and helpful. The main dishes, churrasco and tuna, were great. The decoration is warm and nice. However, the ensalada de espinacas was poor, and the Milhojas for dessert was dry and did not have much taste. It was a bit disappointing at the end, especially given the money we are paying."}
{"text":"Had an excellent, romantic dinner here March 2013. Food was excellent - we had the arroz con mariscos and the carne con camerones, and both were delicious. Very homey food. Fresh seafood is the key here for sure! Prices are kinda high, but you are getting great quality seafood. The live music really made the evening though! Love hearing Guantanamera while I'm eating! It made me feel like I was in a foreign country.  This place feels unlike most Calgary restaurants, in that it has charm.  They also have a great deal if you order two alcoholic coffees, you get a free dessert. The Blue House coffee was excellent (bailey's, Kahlua, vodka and frangelico), but the featured chocolate souffle we got was very floury tasting. Still, it was free, so who cares!  Only downside was the service was poor - we were there for an hour before being asked to place our order. I think our server was a bit under-experienced or something. Luckily we weren't in a rush, so it doesn't affect my rating, and the food came rather quickly after ordering."}
{"text":"Food i ordered was delicious and staff really nice. The only minus is that it's quite pricey as well as more than average wait time for food."}
{"text":"Great food, and great service. I would recommend this slightly out of the way restaurant to others looking for something a little spicy :) The food was exceptionally tasty and the service was prompt and friendly."}
