{"text":"Over Easy

208 Bloor St. West

Ridiculously overpriced garbage.

I ordered the meat lovers omelette. The eggs were overcooked, rubbery and tasteless; probably the worst eggs I've ever eaten in any restaurant ever. The omelette filling was tasteless and lacking in cheese. My friend got the smoked salmon eggs benedict which was a bit better than my order. On the positive: We ordered a side plate of extra bacon which was delicious and beautifully cooked.

The service was breezy and careless. He did not seem happy in his job. We had to ask several times for coffee sweeteners and by the time the server brought them I barely had time for a sip of (badly needed) coffee before our food came. The biggest shock was the bill: over $50 for a simple brunch! We regret not going to Eggsmart instead, which is far better value. The Bloor and Ossingtion location of Eggsmart is great - not Sherbourne and Bloor!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place, nice atmosphere. Food was great, fresh juices with unique flavors like blueberry orange bananna. Reasonable prices, very friendly staff, comfortable and pleasant atmosphere, self serve coffee pots at the table... will come back here for breakfast every time we're in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Great food, fantastic price for what you get.   The servers are a tad stand offish and almost seemed annoyed with us being there. They also don't ask to have the bill split and seemed unwilling to do so when asked (claiming for work and I obviously didn't eat two breakfasts). Aside from this the gem that is over easy is fantastic."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in here before going to the ROM across the street. We sat down around 1:30, and it was not busy at all. Most of the entrees (breakfast and lunch) are priced around $10. I ordered the egg bruschetta and my husband got the Wild Western Sandwich. Both of our entrees included a side. We were both very satisfied with our meals, and would return... if we're ever in Toronto again. 
Also, I ordered a Cappuccino (yes, I'm guilty of ordering one after 10), and it was the best I've had since visiting Italy."}
{"text":"I am visiting my friends in Toronto and we wanted to find a cute place that is near there homes so we didn't have to walk far. Over Easy was just right down the way so we chose there. Being brunch time on a Saturday we thought it may be incredibly busy and they don't take reservations on the weekends, but to our surprise we were seated quite quickly and waited on right away. Our waitress was a wonderful women by the name of Bess who had a bedazzled name plate and called us sweet names like darling and dear; she was wonderful. 

The atmosphere was very cozy and welcoming although it was not the largest of restaurants and the isles were narrow making it challenging if someone was coming in the opposite direction to get by. 

I can't eat eggs so I was worried that I wouldn't actually be able to have anything other than coffee when I arrived but they had many other things on the menu such as pancakes and waffles. Our food came reasonably quickly and tasted great! 

I will say that I was frustrated that they did not sell just regular orange juice which i wanted with my meal and i had to pay $4.50 for a small glass of fresh squeezed orange juice. Although it tasted great, it was over priced. 

Overall it was a nice experience and when I visit Toronto again and I would considered the possibility of visiting Over Easy again."}
{"text":"The major reason I won't go back is surly and indifferent service, particularly the maitre'd. No complaints about the food The Breakfast Burrito was a 7 out of 10. With all the hype, I expected something a little more upscale, but it was OK. The coffee was watery."}
{"text":"The scrambled eggs were grey and rubbery. The coffee was weak and the plastic pot of it on the table was grimy. The walls were very dirty and the paint was peeling. The service was friendly and frequent."}
{"text":"This restaurant charged everyone 15% HST on their bills instead of 13%. I am sure it is an illegal practice to do so. No one usually checks how much they were charged in taxes so it is a good business tactic. In essence, this restaurant scams 2% extra from everyone. It's not much per person but if we consider their annual revenue, 2% is a lot of money. Very disappointing - it is shady to do this to customers. This is a shame as their food is decent. Will not return unless they stop defrauding all their customers."}
{"text":"The food? Delicious.

Eating greasy spoon breakfast on a patio? Superb.

The service? Blah.

Over Easy is just a shot away from my hotel and since the Intercontinental's room-service healthy breakfast is coated in sugar, I ventured out into the great unknown this morning.

The Complete Healthy Breakfast is terrific: a cup of hot oatmeal, fresh fruit (although I loathe anything from the melon family), scrambled egg whites and multi-grain toast.

My server, however, seemed to want to do everything in her power to suck my bright and cheery mood out of me.

She:

* was curt and unfriendly
* did not return to ask me how my meal was
* saw me sitting there, meal finished, and did not bring me my bill
* ignored the other server who called out to her (five feet away) to come handle my bill

As the other server was pushing my credit card through the machine, I said 'is she having a bad day,' hoping to hear she tripped and bruised her knee on the sidewalk, or stabbed herself in the eye with her curling iron this morning, or anything that would give me an excuse to feel sorry for her and leave a tip.

The other server said 'no, I don't think so. We're just really busy.'

Of course, that response always starts a twitch in my eye and I said 'really, there are four of you standing around chit-chatting and six tables.'

Other server says: 'oh, well, uh, maybe she has a headache.'

Another server standing around doing nothing tries to make up for it all with some more idle chit-chat ... 'oh, what a pretty necklace, is that Celtic?'

I left no tip. 

I won't be back."}
{"text":"Alrighty, so, I went here with my girlfriend October 10th, 2014 in the morning before going to the ROM as a matter of convenience. We will NEVER be returning here again. 

I will start with the positives and finish with the negatives. First, the waitress we had (an elderly lady) was very, very nice and attentive. She is pretty much the only reason I am happy with giving Over Easy one star. Second, the decor is pleasant (and if decor is one of the biggest pluses you're running out of beneficial things to say). Third, they give you a pot of coffee right on the table so you do not have to wait around for more or bug the staff for your seventh cup (coffee addict here! Haha!) so... That is all the positives...

For the negatives. First, the guy who greeted us (if it could be called 'greeting') was extremely rude as he sat us. Told us to move away from the front door because we were blocking traffic (no one had attempted to use the door while we were in it and we had walked through the door maybe 10 seconds ago? There was no signage saying 'please seat yourself' or 'please wait to be seated' or 'wait over here please'... We didn't know where to go). He gave an irritated sigh when I tried to explain this to him, walk to a table, literally threw the menus on the table and walked away without saying a further word to us. We sat down there... still weren't too sure if we were suppose to. Second, the staff here does not wipe tables between customers. We watched three table changes and not once did a cloth make an appearance. To make this even worse, there was disgustingly sticky hair on our table behind the condiments from a previous customer. Picture included. Third, speaking of condiments, the milk and cream is not refrigerated during the day. A bowl of it is left out in the table. The milk I used for my coffee was room temperature. Kinda worrisome. Fourth, my girlfriend ordered a vegetarian omelette without mushrooms or onions. She got warm mixed veggies (onions and mushrooms included!) on her plate with scrambled eggs thrown on top. Sorry, but that's not an omelette. What kind of bullshit restaurant takes so little pride in their work that they would present their dish like this? I'm not expecting some sort of extravagant presentation, it's breakfast after all, but if someone orders a omelette, make a fucking omelette. Picture included. Fifth, the pancake that came with my hearty breakfast thing tasted worse than the instant 'just add water' pancakes from the grocery store. Sixth, either the manager or the owner (not sure the position) was literally, and I mean literally, screaming on the phone for about 10 minutes about how an employee was not coming into work because someone at work owed him $50. It was horrendously unprofessional and made attempting to converse impossible. Eight and finally, I called about an hour before coming to ask if I could do a reservation for us. The waitress responded with 'no, are you freaking kidding me? It's during the rush, we are too busy to take reservations.' This was said in a very, 'are you an idiot' manner. A pleasant 'no' would have sufficed.

So... Yea. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"The food was OK with good ingredients, but rather skimpy for the price. I ordered the Asparagus and Swiss omlet, and it only had four or five small chunks of asparagus grouped in the middle."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times and the food is okay. The portions range from reasonably-sized to rather large, and the dishes are generally well-presented. The wait staff have always been attentive and polite, and aren't afraid to up-sell (would you like a glass of freshly squeezed juice to go with your order?). 

The location is close to my office so it's been regular go-to.

Until today.

My coffee arrived with a cockroach. I didn't make a fuss, and the staff dealt with the matter promptly, providing a fresh pot of coffee and new mugs.

Our server was mortified and apologized several times. She discounted the bill by 50%, didn't charge for the coffee, and thanked us for not making a scene. I felt badly for her, as it was clearly a kitchen and/or management gaffe.

But I won't eat at Over Easy again. I can accept that wee beasties are crawling all over the city, but not in my food."}
{"text":"Meh. Amount-wise, you get what you pay for. Quality-wise, I didn't starve but I've definitely experienced way better. I've got the Californian omelette and my boyfriend got the Greek omelette. Both omelettes were overcooked and greasy. So were the homemade fries. The service was breezy. Overall, I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Got the breakfast sandwich with home fries both of which were great. Only reason I didn't give 4 stars is slow service as the place was busy and the ice coffee was just ok slightly watery"}
{"text":"This is the inferior Over Easy location. If you go to the one in the Victoria hotel (Yonge, south of King) the food is amazing, the service is decent, and the space is a lot better. The Bloor location on the other hand is crowded, noisy, has bad service and the food is lack-luster or even disgusting at times.  You're better off trucking it down to the financial area."}
{"text":"3.5 stars 

This place serves all day breakfast and lunch menu items as well. We came here for lunch on a weekday and was quickly seated which was great because we were starving. I decided to get the classic 2 eggs which comes with toast, home fries, slice of tomato and lettuce ($6.99) which is not bad for something around Bloor W area. My friends got caramel and banana french toast (~$10.99) and eggs benedict which came with a side salad (~$14.99). The portion for the french toast was generous, the portion for the eggs benedict was just right for a regular serving. However, for $14.99 to me that's a bit expensive.

Overall, the meal was great and service was alright as well. I would come back here for their breakfast foods."}
{"text":"This place is busy and crowed a lot of the time and the restaurant had somewhat of a diner feel to it. I was in the area around brunch time with a friend, so we decided to give this place a shot. 

I ordered an omelette stuffed with feta, olives and other stuff and they did not skimp with any of the ingredients. The portion of food you receive is good, prices are reasonable for the food.  The service was slow, and I found the beverages to be pricy- I think my dinky cup of orange juice was about $4! 

I must also add that this place seems like a hit or miss type of place since I noticed a few tables sending back their food either because it was underdone or overdone. 

I probably won't go back here again because I think the service could've been better, the tight set-up in the restaurant made me a little uncomfortable, and I don't want to pay $4 for a small cup of juice or any other of their overpriced drinks."}
{"text":"OverEasy Team,

    The first time I came here with my wife, my meal was tasteless with half-cooked onions. She had a similar experience. The second time, I came by myself. My complete healthy breakfast was good but again quite bland. Also, one waiter, Cory, was running around most of the time while the rest were idly chatting.  

The extra star is for a reasonably fast service.

We show more energy during service and put more love into your food."}
{"text":"Cozy brunch cabin in the city. Menu has many options including run of the mill breakfast and lunch platters, wraps, burritos and sandwiches. Food is very tasty and high quality. Portions are small and are around $15 a plate."}
{"text":"Service good considering they were short staffed. Food very average. Probably wouldn't return."}
{"text":"This place has never disappointed.  And it is awesome proximity to the holiday Inn and intercontinental yorkville hotels.  They have a large menu and drinks at 11:00 am which comes in handy for recovery."}
{"text":"I had a cajun chicken wrap and it was pretty good, probably the best wrap I've had in a while.. well seasoned, lots of chicken. Everything else was bad. The fries were a bit disappointing, too thin and too browned. 
I was given the menu and had to wait a considerable amount of time until someone noticed I was waiting and told another waitress to come serve me. She apologized and took my order. She didn't come back to see how I was doing.
In the table next to me there was this girl who apparently was a frequent costumer and all of the servers checked up on her at least every 5 min. Apparently you have to know people to get good service.
The place is boring and has no personality. The wrap was good but not worth coming back."}
{"text":"Good for lots of options.

Last time we went though the food was nothing special and very bland.
Seems a bit over priced too for the food they serve.

Its usually pretty busy on weekends expect a 10-20 minute wait.

The one thing i really like though is that they give you a whole pot of coffee"}
{"text":"This place is a great hangover cure. Having lived on Bloor within minutes of this location the previous two summers, I've gone here a couple times with friends for brunch after a night out.

It's usually packed and busy inside, but they have an outdoor patio that's more low key. Every time I've been there, I've had a short wait to be seated. Wait staff has always been super friendly.

Their breakfast/brunch items are pretty solid. Omelets, home fries, etc. Prices for food are fair, though drinks are kind of pricey...$3 for chocolate milk that tastes like sealtest.

Overall, solid place. There's better options in the area if that's what you're looking for, but you're not going wrong with getting brunch at Over Easy either."}
{"text":"I hate eggs.  So I might be a bit biased (although I didn't actually order any eggs, I had the grilled california chicken sandwich).  It came with a usual breakfast side of hashbrowns (overly crispy and small) but the sandwich was huge.  My friend and I had breakfast on the patio which was really cramped (if I stuck my elbows out too far I would literally be ON the old man sitting at the table next to us).  Which brings me to my next point-- at one point aformentioned old man decided to let out a super gross sneeze and/or cough.  In any case his mouth was wide open and his toast was spewed all over my plate.  And no, he didn't apologize or acknowlegde the fact that he had ruined my breakfast (thankfully I was basically done anyways so my friend and I left).  

Redemption- their orange juice was freshly squeezed and de-lish and the menu items were cheap"}
{"text":"I go to both locations very often as I work by one and live by another. They have a great menu and I have a few faves, including their fresh juices and the Skillet. 

The last two times I have been to Bloor I l've had very substandard portions and quality on dishes I regularly order. Glenn the manager & his family own the restos. When I took the time to tell him, he literally did not care and did not offer to comp even my coffee. As thanks for giving him important feedback about his business, he only gave me attitude, very similar to what other reviewers have said about him. I won't go back to the Bloor location due to issues above. 

On the other hand, his sister, Kirsten or Kiersten, runs the one on Yonge and she is lovely, you can tell she cares about her business, I have chatted with her a few times. The quality at Yonge location is very consitent and the staff are really great and that is due to a great manager!"}
{"text":"I have a thing for brunch spots and Over Easy has moved to the top of my list. Here's why...

A brunch spot should be nicer than a diner and still be in the $-$$ price range (but I happen to prefer being closer to the lower end of $$). Which they are. My breakfast and 2 cocktails came to $25.00. Score.

A brunch spot should have an array of eggs benedict dishes, breakfast cocktails, and home-fries style hash browns (diced and fried potatoes...to die for if you haven't had them). Which they do! They nailed it with Eggs Benedict, it happens to be my favorite dish and I get it every time at breakfast if it's offered. I really enjoyed their cocktails. I personally had the Greyhound which is Grapefruit Juice and Vodka (never had that combination before but it certainly won't be the last) and a Mimosa. And the home fries were fried to perfection, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. 

A brunch spot MUST have excellent service. My server was an absolute sweetheart. He didn't come over to often but he was always present. He made great suggestions and he made me feel happy to be there. I was in brunch heaven. Thank you to the good folks at Over Easy.

I really wish they had bottomless cocktails but then again I don't because the restaurant is small and if you come at the wrong time, you'll have to wait for a table. I've noticed that the bottomless cocktail spots usually have longer waits. But all in all, I wouldn't change anything and I think this is a great spot for tourists. It's close to the subway and right across the street from the Royal Ontario Museum."}
{"text":"4 stars not based on the service, but the food. I really wanted to give it 3.5 stars but what can you do. The Salmon Hollandaise was delicious in flavor and freshness. The \"Eggstro\" that came with mushrooms, bacon, cheese and eggs in a hot skillet was heavy but great. The fries on both plates were overabundant. The plate would have been perfect if they decreased the amount of fries and added a little fruit to the plate. Not too many places can mess up breakfast food and this place surpassed that by having a few unique items that were very tasty. The silverware at this place was dirty and we had to ask for another set. The coke can's brim was also very dirty. There was some confusion in the beginning as to if we had already been given menus and to end it off, the restaurant said they had a very old credit card machine and for some reason it was denying our card. Everywhere else on this week long trip had no problems with the card. We resorted to cash and her tip was shortened. haha"}
{"text":"Ah dommage. Nous y allions régulièrement quand nous étions dans le quartier mais ce midi fut la conjugaison d'un service agressif et dépassé en sus d'une omelette servie avec un magnifique cheveu ... De quoi vous dégoûter à toujours. On nous a remboursé le coût du plat, mais est-ce suffisant ? A mon avis, non."}
{"text":"I have breakfast at this place the cappuccino was great I order waffle with strawberry it was yuumy too like it homemade. I don't recommend the egg bennie since it wasn't cooked well & the place was a bit dirty they need to renovate the place and change there forks, spoons & dishes since it is over used ."}
{"text":"I walked by Over Easy Restaurant, a popular brunch spot in the U of T neighbourhood, many times in the past but never had a chance to eat there.  Finally, I headed over there for brunch recently.  

The location is great - right across the street from the ROM, University of Toronto and other shops & boutiques in Yorkville.  I was surprised at how many guests the restaurant could seat because it looked pretty small from the outside.  We were seated at the front by the windows, a bright and comfortable area.

However, since we were a bit \"separated\" from the rest of the dining area, it was hard to get the server's attention after we were seated.  We had around 10-15 minutes of just looking at the menu before we were asked if we wanted something to drink.

My friend got the English Breakfast ($10.99) with 2 eggs any style, sausage, sautéed mushrooms, grilled tomato, home fries, & toasted malt bread.  This is definitely a big breakfast with your protein, carbs and a bit of veggies.  Perfect when you're feeling extra hungry!

I got the Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict ($13.99), which is pretty much my brunch order anywhere I go.  It is served with home fries (pictured above), fries, salad or soup but I went with their famous home fries.  The smoked salmon was a bit too salty for my liking but the Hollandaise sauce and egg was good.  I also really enjoyed their home fries - very tasty!

Overall, I probably wouldn't go head here unless I was in the area.  Their portions are very generous and food is pretty good but they just lacked attentiveness from the servers.  I know Brunch is a busy seating time, but they could always have more servers during peak hours.  Maybe I'll just have to try something else on the menu next time!"}
{"text":"My brother used to live down the street from this place and I stopped going because I would always feel sick later in the day from eating here.

The portions were decent size but the food was ok at best.  I've never received terrible service here (I guess we were always part of the hit) but for the price and the amount of times I felt sick later in the afternoon I decided I had to stop coming here.  

I've tried a few items on the menu and always the same feeling later in the day."}
{"text":"Over Easy offers a wide variety of breakfast dishes, most notably its breakfast burrito. Whether you're in the mood for waffles and syrup, eggs benedict, a healthy omelette or scrumptious wraps, Over Easy has it all. I was very impressed with the generous portions in addition to the delicious sides, such as the spicy salsa, sour cream and guacamole."}
{"text":"Two words: Breakfast Burrito. 

Over Easy served me what was by far, the best breakfast burrito I've ever had. 

My daughter and I sat at the bar, and the service was quick and very friendly. 

The customers seemed to be a mix of (what I perceived to be) regulars, tourists and a woman with a screaming, shrieking, miserable infant. Funny enough, I found them all equally annoying. 

If we had been the only two people in the restaurant (servers aside), I would've given a 4 or 5 star rating, but the mix of people who were there during this first visit were quite possibly the most annoying mix of people that I've had within ears shot since I went to the blue hair brunch buffet at the Days Inn in Fondulac Wisconsin.  

Back to the meal...my daughter had an omelet with ham, cheese and mushrooms and a smoothie. I had a Perrier and the aforementioned best effin breakfast burrito ever.    We were $40 taxes and tip (20%) in.

The restaurant was quite busy, and we chose to sit at the bar to avoid waiting for a table, and standing near the booth containing the woman with the shrieking infant.

The level of self-importance carried by some people is absolutely laughable and left me thinking \"it's busy, your server knows you're there, and getting up to ask her for coffee while she's getting her orders organized on her tray isn't going to get it to you any quicker\".  But alas, any and every trip out of the house has the ability to remind me of something that I don't like about what I like to call \"jerk offs\".

All in all, I'd go back, and I'd sit at the bar.  It's not cheap, but it's not a dive and it's located on Bloor directly across from the ROM and right around the corner from Yorkville, so you shouldn't expect cheap.  :)

Oh yeah, they don't take debit cards...just cash or credit cards."}
{"text":"The breakfast was typical of a common breakfast chain. It was nothing special. The coffee in my opinion was horrible and they need to get new cups or a better dishwasher because all of the inside of our cups were horribly tarnished looking. Maybe get your coffee elsewhere before you come. The service was ok. I think there are lots of better options for breakfast.
I'm giving this 2 stars, as there's tons of room for improvement."}
{"text":"What a weird and unpleasant experience.  Our food was fine (it's eggs and toast and bacon, it's not complicated) and the service was fine, but the owner/manager guy who works the front totally ruins this place.  He's an obnoxious jerk to the servers (presumably they're his employees) and that's not good for business.  I am not master of the culinary arts business, but your customers are going to have a bad time if you're loudly berating your servers where everyone can hear it.  I'm just trying to have some standard breakfast food and relax, it ruins my experience to have a loud mouth buffoon complaining browbeating employees right over my shoulder.  Take it down a few notches, buddy.  We all like Kitchen Nightmares but you ain't Gordon Ramsay and this ain't no Michelin starred restaurant."}
{"text":"My waitress could not have been nicer.  Very efficient service, friendly and the food was spot-on.  The vegetarian rancheros was spicy and plentiful without being too much food.  And having a large, piping hot coffee crafe delivered when I just asked for a cup was s pleasant surprise"}
{"text":"Enjoyed having brunch at the patio. Had a Florentine Benedict. Taste good but nothing so special."}
{"text":"I cannot pull the trigger on 4 stars for this place. Let's say 3.5.

Admittedly, our food was above average. That would have earned them a four, but there's something about the vibe of this place that won't put it in the category of other breakfast places I've given 4 stars.

The tables are packed pretty tightly, and the decor leaves a bit to be desired. I don't need fancy...but SOME character would be nice. They earn praise for bringing a thermal carafe of coffee to the table, but the sparkle in my eye upon seeing that quickly grows dim when I realise that the coffee cup is PLASTIC. I was hoping that this location would differ from the one on Yonge in that regard. I've been to about 80 breakfast places in the category into which Over Easy falls, but it hold the distinction as the only one that serves coffee (and tea, in our case) in plastic mugs. Ecch.

The eggs were properly cooked, the tiny, cubed home fries were tasty and my friends' were happy with their dishes of a) Corned Beef Hash, which T proclaimed as possibly the best he'd had in Toronto, and b) \"The Skillet\" (sausage, bacon, home fries, green pepper, mushroom and onion cooked in a skillet and topped with aged cheddar & fried eggs - they also had a veggie version), which was \"skillet-lickin' good\", according to O.

Service was adequate.

So...if you are in the area looking for a diner breakfast, you could do worse than this place."}
{"text":"This is the Monk's Coffee House of Toronto. It has a great selection of breakfast fare and they're very accommodating. My mother actually enjoyed the breakfast served here as opposed to the breakfast offered at our hotel, the Park Hyatt. It's in close proximity to the ROM and Bata Shoe Museum. It's pretty affordable and they were willing to do separate checks when I went with 3 friends. Each omelet came with toast and hash browns and healthier options were available. This is an overall must for any breakfast lover."}
{"text":"Been meaning to go to this place for the last couple years. Finally took the plunge! Was not disappointed.

This place made me feel really nostalgic for some reason. Just the way everything was laid out. Simple, good food for agreeable prices? Count me in! It wasn't anything fancy by any means of the imagination but they did serve me a good omelet! The highlight for me though was the home fries. They were REALLY good. 

The service was alright too. Nothing incredible, but when I asked my waiter about some of the options on the menu since it was my first time here, he answered all my questions kindly without looking like he was really frustrated, or in a rush, or bored, etc. While this seems really basic, these days, sadly sometimes basic conduct is not upheld.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"I love this place we go here pretty regularly for Sunday brunch. Everything in their menu is soo good thus I always have a hard time picking. Eggs Benedict, the skillet and eggs bruschetta is one of my few favourites. Service is always polite and prompt as well!"}
{"text":"Came up on it as we left the parking garage before we went to the museum. Food was good and staff was attentive. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Bruschetta was tight. Might have been a little expensive. But if you a baller, then ball out. Good atmosphere, good service."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a couple of times and my experience has been positive each time. The menu is exciting, the prices are decent, and the food tastes great! The service is good considering how busy this place is."}
{"text":"Good prices, decent sized portions and great, fast service. Now topping my list for favourite brunch places."}
{"text":"Me and my partner both enjoyed our meals here. Coffee was pretty good too. Service is pretty lax. I mean... when it came time to pay the bills (we paid separate), our server gave us the machine and let us input our own bills while they walked off to man another station (the juicer, I think?). We kinda just sat there unsure of what to do. Either they put a lot of faith in us to not dine and dash or they didn't care... (We paid.)"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast this past weekend. I have eaten here a few times before, always a good breakfast with a large menu. Service was cheerful and attentive. I would recommend."}
{"text":"A very cozy restaurant with a homey feel. The staff are all very friendly and it's pretty casual.

We ordered the Tuscan and Meat Lover's omelettes with a side of home fries. You can also opt for fries or a salad. It also comes with toast. Although the home fries were slightly smaller, nonetheless they were crispy and surprisingly really good.

The omelettes were delicious. You could easily pull the melted cheese as you cut into the omelette. The omelettes are made using 3 eggs so you get the real ingredients. 

This is a great location for breakfast and/or brunch. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Went there for a late breakfast with my lady and I must say, it was an absolute revelation! 

We both are the kind of people that can consume copious amounts of breakfast-type food at any time of the day, and so it was a thorough surprise to find a place in the Annex that wasn't only economic and reasonable, but also had a diverse menu that gave a wide degree of choice. 

We ended up ordering the classic, which included eggs (well done for me!), toast with a healthy smattering of butter, sausages, crisp bacon and a ridiculous amount of home fries, which were done to perfection. The greasiness of the eggs and the toast were quite delectable, and not at all overwhelming. Yet, it was the fries that stole our culinary hearts. They were crisp on the outside, and buttery soft on the inside providing a good starchy compliment to the egg proteins. 

We, washed it all down with a cup of Earl Grey, and it all came to a reasonable $20-25. The service too was quite excellent, as the waiter didn't come by too often as me and my gf were conversing, but often enough to check up on us and see if we needed anything (which we did, from time to time). 

A solid 4-star experience, which we would happily repeat!"}
{"text":"Would NOT recommend this place.. I really REALLY hope the employees would see this review.
Went with a girlfriend, and we ordered \"Eggy Hammy Cheesy,\" an omelette (can't remember the name), a side order of fruit salad and orange juice.

First, my friend ordered and asked for white bread. They then took my order but didn't ask what bread I wanted. They just assumed I'd want white bread too? I was sitting there thinking oh maybe the eggy hammy cheesy doesn't have side bread? Confused...

Second, they don't ask you how you want your eggs... Is it always \"over easy?\" I like my eggs fully cooked but they came out all mushy and gross... Whatever.

Third, the bread was completely burnt. All four slices. Really? Come on. How's your toaster?

Fourth, the home fries (in contrast to what other people have said) are MEH. Go to the all-day breakfast restaurant whose name starts with \"Our\" in the Kensington Market area for paprika flaked, much more delish home fries.

Lastly, the price. Holy moly the two of us spent like $40 on BREAKFAST. Will be going somewhere else next time for sure.

Overall, NOT a great place unless they start asking customers what they want and not ASSUME, aka, make an ASS out of U and ME."}
{"text":"I had breakfast here twice during my time in Toronto and both times the food was good. I wouldn't say it was absolutely delicious, but it's a good spot to grab a quick bite to eat in the morning. I had two poached eggs with no meat on the side and it was reasonably priced. The service is nice and quick, however I felt the place could've been a bit cleaner-the menus were tattered and slightly sticky and the table felt kind of grungy. 
To sum up, food is mediocre, ambiance is mediocre, convenience is great."}
{"text":"Love how I can get homogenized milk here - cold and creamy and goes the best with their hot breakfast items. 

They are somewhat pricey but do make pretty top-notch breakfast, at least in the Bloor location, and I think I have tried everything over the years and have had nothing to complain about: egg in a hole, eggstro, English breakfast, skillet, Big Breakfast, eggy hammy cheesy, pancakes, waffles, French toast,  everything!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast option. Best one in this part of bloor st. Great deals for the quality of the meals and portions very centrally located so very easy to get to. Come if your an egg fAnatic it enjoy breakfast foods! Great front patio for a nice day to enjoy some sunshine and hear the hustle and bustle of bloor street!"}
{"text":"I came to Over Easy this past weekend for brunch around noon. The place was packed with a few groups waiting outside for a table as well. We were seated pretty quickly, only had to wait 2 minutes. 

Overall, I was surprised when I walked inside because the restaurant was so cramped with tiny booths all over. The waiters had great coordination in making sure they didn't bump into one another as they were walking up and down the tiny aisles. Service was also very fast and efficient, I can imagine they turn over very quickly at this place. 

I ordered a Tuscan omelette (sundried tomatoes, asiago cheese, sauteed mushrooms) with home fries and rye toast. It came piping hot to the table and was delicious! The cheese was ooey gooey and there were large pieces of mushrooms, a very packed omelette with tons of flavour. Needed a touch of seasoning though but that's not a big deal, I prefer when the food is under salted to over salted. The homefries were the tiniest diced potatoes, crispy all the way round and sauteed with onions, the gave a HUGE portion of home fries with the omelette. Toast arrived in a cute little basket although the jam selection was mediocre (there was only strawberry). 

Prices were decent as well, we spent around $30 for two people including tax and tip. 

I would highly recommend this place, a cosy spot with a large selection of breakfast and lunch dishes, something for everyone!"}
{"text":"Basic brunch food, nothing exceptional or amazing. The place had a diner feel; and the plates, mugs, cutlery, etc. were in need of an update.  My issue with this place however was not the food it was the staff.  They on a number of occasions were just gathered around the back chit chatting away instead of taking care of their guests. This made it extremely hard to get their attention or refills or even the bill at the end; I wasn't sure if this was a common thing with the service or simply in response to the below incident.  

Once I had my food, I spilled some ketchup on my side of the table and thigh and tried to clean up what I can with the one napkin I had on the table, but the table was still messy and sticky so I asked my partner to ask our server to wipe it clean for us while I snuck off to the bathroom to clean up my pants. Once back, my partner informs me that while I was gone she had told the server what happened and he reluctantly left to grab a cloth then simply dropped it off at the table for us to clean up the table top.  My partner had to grab his attention again for him to do that himself then take the cloth away.

I'm not sure where this server dines, but I have never been given a wet cleaning cloth at a place I am dining and asked to clean up the table.  I'm not trying to come off as snobby or entitled but that's just basic service at a restaurant and I've worked in that industry - That would never fly at the places I had worked."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on my birthday last week. Had the smoke meat hash, while my girlfriend got the eggs Benedict. 

The food was filling but not exceptional. Prices were quite reasonable for downtown and the coffee came it owns awesome urn for do it yourself refills (genius) Service was very quick despite the amount of people in the place. 

Recommend if you want a decent breakfast on Bloor that won't break the bank."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I've been going here for years, and will travel far and wide to visit. The service is great and that staff are very friendly.  The food is tasty at affordable prices.  Recommendation: Get there early if going on a weekend, or expect a line up. 

Some of the great things about this place: 
LOCATION - close to the subway and easily accessible 
SIZE - comfortable, cozy  atmosphere
SERVICE - quick, accurate, accommodating
PRICE - excellent for the quality of food
FOOD - great breakfast/brunch done right
 
--love it!"}
{"text":"The last few times I have eaten here, the quality of food has really gone down. Last time I had the Eggy Hammy Cheesy and it was such a letdown. The English muffin, while drenched in sauce, was touch and had a stale taste to it. I maybe ate half of it. While it was takeout, I walked 60' east to my building so it didn't have enough time to turn
The previous time I had the Eggs in a Hole, and this experience was even worse. Again, the bread (bagel) was hard as soap stone. The eggs were over cooked and dry. The home fries were really salty and the texture was as though they had been sitting on the side griddle for hours. 
Both experiences were at around 7:30am, so it wasn't that it was late in the day and everything had been sitting...unless it was overnight. 
I gave 2 stars because service was prompt and friendly

That's it"}
{"text":"Never have I been to a restaurant where the food was so gross that I couldn't eat it! I am not a picky eater AT ALL but the food here was AWFUL. We started with a basket of fries which were barely warm and soaked in grease. They were so soggy we asked for homefries instead, and we received soggy/greasy homefries. Then I ordered egg whites, cottage cheese, and grilled chicken. Not only did I find bones in the chicken, but it had clearly been grilled days before and reheated in the microwave. It was like rubber!!! We asked for a side toast and the bread was warm but not even toasted! 

Even worse our waitress ignored us the whole time! She only stopped to bring us our food and to give us the bill. It was clear that we didn't enjoy our fries or meals because we pushed the full plates to the edge of the table and were not eating them. She just kept looking at us from the counter but never bothered to ask why we weren't eating or if everything was ok. 

I didn't want to make a scene so we paid and left. I really should've talked to the manager. Our waitress even billed us for the fries and homefries that WE SENT BACK TO THE KITCHEN."}
{"text":"I'm a bit conflicted...

the food was great! And oh god those potatoes were heavenly. The tea and coffee were original and creative. 

My problem was we went on a work-weekday. Our server was all smiles and all love and was wonderful. The problem was I think our poor server had to deal with the entire restaurant! She was trying so hard but was obviously over whelmed. She barely got our order together and I over heard her having a heard time with the neighbour. Also - we waited FOREVER for the check! FOREVER, I has almost late for work and we had given ourselves 2 hours plus getting ready time at home. It's breakfast food, its supossed to go fast!"}
{"text":"Favorite place to go for a tried-and-true breakfast! Absolutely adore their smoked salmon eggs benedict, but also love their aged cheese (n thick bread!) tuna melt. Can't exactly make up my mind, but I know for sure that the sunny disposition and happy charm of the staff will keep me coming back here time and time again.

They offer home fries, fries, salad, or soup with almost every entrée, so it's quite filling, although the soup portion is more like a cup (but the salad is huge, so go for that if you're feeling like an actual meal). Sucks that they open at 7 and close at 4, with no foreseeable change in the schedule, but this is definitely a treat to college kids everywhere, ruined from the all-nighters, and in need of destressing with some genuinely fresh food."}
{"text":"Mixed bag. For the location prices are reasonable. Eggs benny was good; nice ham and eggs perfectly packed soft. Home fries deep fried not skillet or flat top. Just a FYI. \"Fresh squeezed\" grapefruit juice was fermented. Granola was good but Side of fruit old and left on the table. Service depends on who you get..."}
{"text":"We are regulars at this place. Like the fact that they offer salad as an option for a breakfast side and that they accept modifications. Their menu additions which include a dish with poached eggs and avocado are good."}
{"text":"Very good variety of salty and sweet breakfast choices. I love their pancakes. 
However, they are not very sincere about their juices. They say it freshly squeezed, but it's a mix with bottle juice. But they were really nice to admit and change it for me."}
{"text":"Yesterday, a former employee suggested this place. He told me the food is better but the service could be \"hit & miss\". My experience was the opposite.

I ordered the Eggs Bruschetta.  I definitely enjoyed the poached eggs on top of the toast. The combination of the bruschetta mix, egg yolk and bread was a scrumptious combination. Unfortunately, the same could not be said for the home fries. They were a bit overcooked and bland. Of course, this could be how the locals prefer their breakfast potatoes. The regular coffee appeared to be a dark roast. It definitely needed more cream than I use for a medium roast.

The service was great. I was concerned when I was seated at very far end of the restaurant. Fortunately, the waitress stationed at that end was at top of her game. I did not have to wait long when I needed something."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times already and I really like this place. They give you a whole pot of coffee so you can refill your cup whenever you want instead of having to wait for them to refill it for you. I like the skillets and the club sandwich."}
{"text":"Fastest service of any restaurant I've ever been to.  Sat down at the counter/bar (not in booth, might take longer at a booth), ordered my scramble and home fries, and it arrived within three minutes!  My toast arrived only moments later.  And it was so delicious.  Much better than a fancier breakfast place down the street.  It was a giant plate of veggies and eggs, buttery and cheesy but not too much cheese.  I enjoyed it immensely.  The toast was soft and buttery as well.  Fast service on tea also.  The meal was huge- I was starving and barely finished- it could easily feed two people for a light breakfast.  When I come back to Toronto I will definitely return."}
{"text":"The Skillet is very good! The staff is a little slow but friendly. 

I am staying at the Hyatt and a quick walk down Bloor led me to this restaurant that offers breakfast all day. My kinda place. I was not greeted at the door but I found my own way to the bar where I prefer to eat. Once seated, a server poured me coffee and took my order. I really enjoyed The Skillet. Two over easy eggs on top of a good portion of potatoes, diced sausage, onions and peppers."}
{"text":"It's been here for a while and I'm not sure why. The food is mediocre, and definately not my first choice for brunch. Pay a few more bucks and get a great one at L'Espresso Bar Mecurio down the street, or walk a few more blocks to the Annex. 

We came around lunch time on a Thursday afternoon, just couples, families. The decor is dingy and hasn't seemed to change since they first opened up (note: chipped paint and dingy lighting)

Lots of seating and it was comfy, but extremely annoying low drone of something (subway? pile drivers behind? air con?) coming from the back. 

The bathroom is gross at the back, and you pass by all their supplies and kitchen as you head into the non ventilated toilets. 

The food is decently priced, but it's not amazing. Got the corned beef hash with poached egg ($9.99, asked for a side of hollendaise, which was tasty). The Corned Beef Hash was bigs of bacon mixed up with their homefries. The Hollendaise was light and comparable to the one you get a golden griddle. 

Coffee is $2.50 and she gives you a big pot. I don't know if I like bottomless coffee like that since I only really drink one cup a day. I much rather spend this money on a Starbucks than their watery tasteless coffee. 

Decent if you're desperate, but not a first choice."}
{"text":"Go there every week.
They're the nicest, treat you lovely, have unlimited coffee, and the food is always delicious."}
{"text":"Thought it would be a long wait on a Sunday at noon but they were very quick to seat us! Packed house but food came out at a decent time. I had the eggs Benny! Very good. Filling too! Def worth the initial 10 min wait"}
{"text":"Over Easy is the place to enjoy a great English breakfast: sausages, scrambled eggs and potatoes. Top that off with a freshly brewed cup of coffee along with friendly service and you might just get through your long day. Real convenient location for UofT students, right on Bloor and Avenue road."}
{"text":"Overeasy did what I wanted them to do, cook, eggs, bacon, and potatoes, just the way I like them. Scrambled, not too greasy, and with a bit of crunch...you follow that...
Brunch food, comfort food is soooo sleepiness inducing, it's so good. OE, is a basic, place, bright decor, solid food, and tons of traffic. Right across from the ROM, the perfect place to fuel up, then head across the street and walk a cool place for 3-4 hours.
But back to OE, I'm not going to rave about bacon and eggs, but OE has a good varied menu, hits all the breakfast/brunch high points and turns it out in a good pace. Something I always worry about, I hate to wait for an extended period for breakfast...breakfast should never take very long to cook...
Everyone liked their plates, so another success...good job OE..."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout, got the two eggs breakfast without meat and it was $10 after tax. I got my eggs over easy yet they broke the yolks and they were all over the place. For $10 I would expect at least the yolks to not be broken. Very underwhelming - won't be back."}
{"text":"Great home fries, eggs were perfect. PRICE IS TOO HIGH! Also FLIES BUZZING EVERYWHERE.  Considering what you pay for breakfast, they should be able to deal with all the flies.  It's cold outside too, so I'm guessing they are drain flies..."}
{"text":"5 stars. Ok I know Canada has good fries everywhere but this place best home fries in Toronto. Scrambled eggs good. Orange juice great. Plus outside is great. Just one problem FLIES!!!  Waiters very nice. So this place is yummy yummy yummy yummy Patrick's son over and out."}
{"text":"Visited here for breakfast during a short trip to Toronto - it was near my hotel.  Really lovely, diverse menu - I had a hard time deciding what to eat.  The food was great and ingredients seemed fresh.  Had an amazingly attentive and sweet waitress. Coffee quite good. 

Only downside: decor.  The exposed ceiling looked gross and asbestos-y."}
{"text":"My husband and i shared the big breakfast plus i added a blueberry pancake.The pancakes were the best I've had in a while. It looks as if they were bejeweled with wild blueberries which i found titillating as an American. The service was awesome and the prices affordable for Toronto."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. Over easy easy, eggers can be cheesa babay"}
{"text":"Mmmm eggs bruschetta.  I used to live really close to here, so this was a regular brunch/lunch place.  It's a bit pricey, although being near the Intercontinental and the ROM can mark anything up.  The eggs bruschetta were worth it, though.  

The atmosphere is really cute - yellow and blue and really just \"warm.\"  Although I ordered the same thing every time (can you take a guess?) everyone else who I ever came here with finished all of there food.  

Also, the place closes early - so don't go here for a late lunch!"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I went to the Over Easy located at the intersection of Yonge & King Street (in the Hotel Victoria) for brunch.

My first impression of the restaurant was that it was very dark and dingy. The decor of the place itself was also very dated and there does not appear to have been any recent renovations . The waiters and waitresses were all very friendly though, however I suggest that you go early (1130-1145) because the place tends to get very busy at around noon. Towards the end of our lunch it did get a little noisy.

I ordered the breakfast poutine which consisted of home fries, cheese curds, bacon, off-the-bone baked ham, poached eggs & hollandaise sauce and it also came w/ toast. 

When our order arrived the first thing I noticed was the size of the poutine and how it was a rather small portion. I guess it is an ideal size for breakfast however I think it was a little overpriced at $11.99 for the little bowl that we got. The poutine itself was rather tasty. The hollaindaise sauce was well made - creamy with a hint of lemon. It complemented well with the homefries, bacon, ham, and egg and really \"bound\" them all together to make a decent breakfast poutine. 

One complaint other than the size was that I had ordered homefries but instead got regular fries in my poutine. I did let the waitress know and she was very apologetic and offered to have the kitchen make a new one but due to the time constraint I opted to eat what was given to me which ended up not being bad at all.

Overall, the atmosphere of the restaurant was very casual. I think they need to change the colors and the lighting to brighten the place up a bit as it is fairly dark inside but it wasn't dirty...just dark. The service was great - food came quickly and we were in and out of there within an hour. The food was good. It wasn't the best in Toronto but it was tasty and the breakfast poutine was a very creative way to serve breakfast."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Everything we had was ace! Cornflake Crunch French Toast made of super soft bread and the crispness of the cornflakes and batter are heavenly. The Huevos rancheros was also fantastic. Lots of tables and booths. 

The line was intimidating outside but they are efficient at turning over tables and getting you something to eat. We waited 5 minutes for coffee and 10 more for our meals. Hard times to beat these days. 

Over Easy does not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent breakfast/brunch place if you ask me. Wish they stayed open later. 
It does get busy during the weekend but I've never had to wait for a table any time that I've been, mainly because it's very spacious and there's a small patio open during the summer. 
The eggs bruschetta is my personal favorite and it comes in a large portion with fries, definitely worth the splurge. 
They accommodate special requests and substations very well. I remember this one time I requested 2 blueberry and 2 chocolate pancakes  rather than 4 of just one kind, and the kitchen gladly did it for me (probably because it was slow at the time). 
Service is great as well, friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Over Easy is a diner, pretty much like the ones that you see on TV in various movies and series. I have been here for most of my breakfasts in Toronto, it was close to the hotel and served reasonable food at a reasonable price.

There is an interesting selection to pick from, coffee is good and abundant, service is real nice and quick.

If you are looking for a full fledged American breakfast that doesn't break the bank, it's a very good place to stop."}
{"text":"Had the Huevos Rancheros. Tasted exactly as good diner food should: greasy, salty and deliciously mixed-up."}
{"text":"OK is the word--We recently ate there three mornings in a row. We ordered omelettes well done and they barely fit the description. Hated the cubed potatoes that passed for home fries, though the whole wheat toast  was delicious. Service was spotty--two of the three days the service was spot on but on the third we got a waiter who probably should have worked for the government--yeah--really plodding.Prices were really high and even put some NY diner breakfast fees to shame!"}
{"text":"Had an enjoyable brunch with the family here. The chocolate chip pancakes were a hit with my son and we enjoyed the omelettes. Next time I want to try the breakfast poutine. Friendly service, nice atmosphere.  Will return."}
{"text":"Over Easy was my go-to place for breakfast / brunch / whatever while I was in university and even if I don't go very often anymore, I still have very fond memories of lotsa coffee, breakfast at whatever time I got around to it (usually after noon) and awkward conversation with whatever girl I had a crush on that semester, ostensibly to get notes off of or some such. 

Service was always just fine, never casting dispersions on U of T students who probably weren't going to tip well (myself excluded of course) and the coffee and other more fancy beverages were usually quite tasty. The Huevos Rancheros and the Spanish Omelette (hold the mushrooms) are my faves but they really do have a pretty solid and varied breakfast menu. As their name suggests, eggs are their specialty and they do them quite well.

So make it a part of your routine if you need a place to start the day while shirking your studies / flirting with your fellow students. It's worth the extra few bucks vis-à-vis McDonald's or some place on campus...hopefully you have better luck than I did when it comes to impressing the cute girl who sits in front of you!"}
{"text":"I've been to Over Easy many times, but the service today has ruined my love for this place. While my friend and I were trying to decide on our meal, a bug crawled up the wall next to us. I hate bugs and we quickly called a waitress over. She did not seem pleased to be called over to a section that was not hers (she ignored us after this) and called a different waiter to kill the bug for her. The waiter just took a napkin, killed the bug, and left. No apologies, clean up, or offer for a new table was offered. This was disgusting. 
Then, after our order came, my friend tried to open the ketchup bottle and it exploded on here. Ketchup went everywhere, all over her clothes. We tried to call someone over for help but no one looked at us (the waitress from earlier ignored us, I don't know her name but she had red hair). Eventually we got our waiter to come over and told him that the bottle had exploded and he replaced it with a new one. 
At the end, our waiter did not charge us for the drinks, but that did not do much to make up for what happened. 
I will definitely never go back here again."}
{"text":"Over Easy is my key place for breakfast takeout when I head to work on an empty stomach.

This restaurant is both cheap and a few steps away from my office. However, these are not the only reasons why I keep returning for more food.

Over Easy's selection is large, their portions are HUGE and the prices would be friendly for anyone's wallet.

I always order the classic breakfast - two eggs, hashbrown potatoes and some crispy bacon.

So far, I have only done the egg route for protein intake, but I will be trying some of their yummy sweet selections such as pancakes soon.

My only complaints about the restaurant is that their service is rather slow every time I have come there. As well, the food is sometimes packaged up and is not hot, so that sometimes takes away from the fresh hot breakfast feel."}
{"text":"Nice little spot to have breakfast or brunch. They have a huge selection of of omelettes, toast and other breakfast items. Prices range from $8 to $20 per dish which is more than reasonable for downtown. So far I tried a couple of their specials and both were good although a bit heavy (lots of cheese and bacon). Great selection of juices and smoothies as well. 
Both times I was there the servers were very nice, and we got our food in less than 20 minutes."}
{"text":"I came here recently with a group of people for breakfast at the Yonge & King location. I ordered a simple 2 egg and fries dish. I ordered scrambled and I got a weird fried, omelet style fried egg. Definitely not how scrambled eggs are made.

There's nothing special to write about this place. I feel le sad reviewing breakfast places that can't do breakfast right."}
{"text":"I used to come here a bit when I went to UofT. I went here recently and realized the places of my youth no longer inspire me. 

Location is awesome as it's a stones throw away from UofT, the ROM, Yorkville shopping, and the Bata Shoe Museum. 

Service is hit and miss as sometimes they are very friendly and attentive as other times they curse you behind your back and neglect you on purpose. I'm not sure why the service is so inconsistent but it always crosses my mind before I enter the doors. Am I going to get a friendly and attentive server or a hungover, miserable, inattentive one. I guess for some people it could be fun to see which side of Jekyll/Hyde is gonna show up but for me I dread it and get slightly anxious.

Food here is typical diner grub, also hit and miss. Sandwiches are huge, so are the breakfast platters, and so are the desserts.. hmm, looks like they have large servings here. Too bad it's either going to be a large serving of great food or crap food. Seasonings and cooking seem to be inconsistent. Sometimes too well done and over seasoned, other times almost raw and under seasoned.

Decor feels very comfortable. Light colored wood, blue walls, white and blue accents. Something about it makes me feel like I'm at Grandma's house, if she lived on T.V. and her house had to feed 50 people. Not sure why though, maybe it's the color layout and the small knickknacks on display. Maybe it's just my grandma that had white and blue all over the room with little knickknacks.

Overall, it's a tough one. When they are good they are great but when they are bad they're really really really bad. Pretty much a coin flip on this one but the odds aren't terrible. If you had a 50/50 chance of winning the lottery, the odds would seem amazing. At least the prices won't break the bank."}
{"text":"Great clean breakfast or lunch choice. Very affordable and I liked it better than my hotel food. Very friendly staff. I noticed alot of people meet here for small meeting over a meal. Smoked Salmon Benedicts is now a favorite. I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"We stayed downtown at the Intercontinental Hotel (stagette party) and this place is literally two doors away.

I wasn't impressed. Ordered mint tea and they brought me a plastic mug that was horribly coffee-stained on the inside (it also smelled funny). They also brought me green tea, not mint, but I didn't notice till I'd already poured it. Apparently all the mugs are the same...plastic and stained. Ew?

Among the massive list of menu options, I went with the Montreal smoked hash and was disappointed.

All in all, this place is meh.

My advice if you're looking for a nice brunch in this neighbourhood: walk two blocks east and hit up La Societe...it's all Parisian chic inside and the food is great (but on the pricier side)."}
{"text":"good food, really overpriced though.

If you are getting the traditional $5 breakfast (eggs, toast, home fries, bacon/sausage) then fine, but everything else is so obscenely overpriced I don't understand how they have the one reasonable item on the menu.

The worst is the drinks, every drink except the coffee is like $5. A glass of fucking orange juice is that much (or just as bad) and you don't get refills. the only fairly priced drink is  the Coffee in which for $2 you get a pot that fills at least 3 cups.

if you come here don't make the mistake of ordering anything other than the traditional breakfast. My friend did and our usual breakfast bill of $12-$20 was $35. unless you are some obscenely wealthy bacon fan don't buy anything else on the menu, other than the prices though I admit the food is good."}
{"text":"If you're looking to get really gourmet brunch food, with spotless service and super clean plates, then go somewhere else.  If you're looking to get tasty brunch food, nothing fancy, and decently priced - then this is the place to go!!

The wait here sucks - and especially in the winter time, it's intolerable (the ante-room can probably only fit 5 without it becoming awkward), and the staff are just average.

My typical meals here is pancakes with a side sausage and bottomless cup of coffee - a great way to start off any day! (read: not every day)."}
{"text":"This place is extremely overpriced. Portions are terribly small ($11 for a poor quality eggs benedict and some home fries!), coffee is extremely weak (I would rather drink coffee at work, yuck).

You're better off going to Flo's Diner at Yorkville + Bay. It's also overpriced, but still a considerable upgrade.

I'd rather go to McDonalds. for breakfast? yes. It's sad but true.

If it's a weekend, try Cafe Mercurio further west on Bloor at St. George."}
{"text":"Me and my friend tried the Eggstro and English Breakfast, neither of us liked it. The only thing we liked was their home fries but it was nothing special. Their hygiene is really disappointing which they gave us a coffee cup with lipstick stains in the beginning, and then gave us another cup still doesn't look clean enough afterwards. Does not worth the price for this quality restaurant."}
{"text":"Reassuring diner food...

We went there twice for breakfast. Had the Montreal-style bagels with cream cheese, fresh fruit bowls and coffee. Pleasant service and reasonable prices. Coffee- connoisseurs will not love the coffee but they do put a whole pot on your table so be grateful for quantity and catch a fancy latte elsewhere."}
{"text":"The breakfast is quite standard, and tastes fine. But because of the price, I expect more...Free wifi is a plus"}
{"text":"THE HOLLANDAISE WAS SOUR!!

THE COFFEE WAS WEAK!!

THE POTATOES WERE COLD!!!!!!

HELL TO THE NO!!

I was so disappointed to discover my former favorite breakfast spot had deteriorated so alarmingly in the past 3 years. It was a truly horrific experience, save the fresh squeezed grapefruit juice. 

Don't even bother."}
{"text":"After a restful night at the Intercontinental Hotel (2 doors down), we came to this special place for breakfast. Between the AMAZING food and wonderful portions, and the fabulous and quirky service offered by our server, this is easily on my top 5 breakfast places in the city. I can easily see how this place could have lineups in the summer months. 

I love getting a pot of coffee for the table so you can refill whenever you want! Amazing!

This is also a great starter place for those in town for a ROM visit, as it's literally across the street! At a cost which is a fraction of what it should be considering its location, this gem hidden under a bar hits all the right spots.

Thanks for an awesome start to our day in Toronto!"}
{"text":"It's a decent place to get breakfast and brunch. Not the best, and not the worse. The server was very attentive and friendly. I had a few hours to kill before heading to an event and the server was nice enough to let me spend a log time in the restaurant using their WiFi without constantly ordering more food to justify the long stay.

The food was ok but I found the poached eggs to be overcooked. The ham was a bit too dry but the sauce was pretty good. The salad that came with it wasn't that special. It came with this thick tangy salad dressing that wasn't that special. It tasted ok but I've had better.

I'm pretty happy with the service so I'd come back to eat for that reason alone."}
{"text":"This place made my entire trip! Not only was the food incredible, but the two people who waited on us were the nicest most sincere people I've ever met. Everything from the coffee to the home fries were perfect. It would be worth walking miles to get to this place. I can promise you I will be going back tomorrow morning. 
Honestly I know it seems petty to write this much for a simple breakfast, but this place is worth it. It would be the best decision of your morning."}
{"text":"Sometimes there's something so simple that causes you so much grief that it clouds your overall impression of a restaurant. Having a seat on a very small patio during the \"OpenTheSteet\" festival where Bloor was blocked off, on a beautiful day set the perfect stage for a great breakfast.

Receiving a so-so Healthy Fat breakfast with 2 poached eggs, 2 pieces of avocado,some salmon and old mushy tomatoes, took down the experience a notch and receiving your breakfast with 2 plastic containers of butter and one of honey sitting right on the food takes the review way down. I don't understand how restaurants think it is acceptable to place those plastic packets, (that have been handled through shipping and distribution and exposed to who knows what kind of bacteria) right on top of the food! Is it really too much trouble just to bring them on the side?

The meal itself wasn't great. The best part was the two slices of multi-grain toast. The poached eggs were so soft they looked like they glanced at some hot water. The smoked salmon was okay however the tomato slices, which I would have liked to have eaten with the salmon seemed to be garnish for the dish. Overall, at $14.95, this was not good experience.

Service was okay, albeit a bit \"clinical\". I walked inside to go to the bathroom and can't say I saw very many happy faces...you the kind faces saying, \"where's my meal\", \"I can't get any service\", and \"the food is not that great\". Just an observation on my part.

If you want to have a nice breakfast either on a great patio or even inside, L'Espresso Bar Mercurio just down the street is a much better place and the prices are nearly the same."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfasts in the Toronto core area!

Their food is absolutely fantastic and flavored to perfection. I've never had a bad meal from them, and their home fries are the BEST (it's a must have)! The servers are very nice and efficient, which is great for those faster mornings.

The area is in a great location, right across from the ROM and U of T, and 2 stations subway ride away from eaton center, making this an ideal breakfast place as part of a weekend outing to Downtown Toronto. 

The decor is very homey and classic, yet clean, and you can always smell the eggs and bacon coming from the back!"}
{"text":"I agree with everyone else who has complained about the staff (and the gross, stained coffee mugs). Our server was very rude. He made snarky little comments about everything I did. I'd never had this happen to me anywhere else. I don't know how anyone can speak with such attitude and be so critical towards a customer that they don't even know. It was very strange and off-putting, I don't think I'll be returning.

My portion of food was decent, I wasn't able to finish it all (got a rude remark from the server about that), but my friends portion seemed very small. It tasted alright, nothing too special. It certainly didn't make up for the bad server. There are plenty of other placed to eat where the staff won't make you feel like crap."}
{"text":"It's a good greasy spoon type of place to get some breakfast food, nothing fancy. Food is good, basic things like eggs and granola were good. Location is great, in front of U of T and the ROM."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and it is standard brunch fare with some different options.  I had the Montreal smoked meat hash which was a good size and tasted good and my husband had the b g breakfast which had a pancake shaped like a maple leaf which was cute.  We also ordered the Mac and cheese for my son.  He liked it but I found it rather bland.  They used a sharp cheese on top which gave it some flavour but should probably include more of it in their actual sauce.  Coffee was the typical bad stuff at diners, but that's to be expected.  Staff was very friendly and accommodating with our son, giving his milk even with a cover and straw.  Not rocket science but something overlooked by most places."}
{"text":"I can't say much about this place. i forgot that I went here a while back and never reviewed it.

All I can recall is that its nice, the food wasn't bad and that it was a bit cramped. Other than that it wasn't anything special or else I would have remembered it."}
{"text":"This place was located right next to our hotel so we had to stop in, especially on a crisp day, we didn't feel like walking far with the kids. The place is a small, quaint place with quite the menu. 

I was out on a quest to eat anything poutine so when I saw the breakfast poutine on the menu, I had to get it. It has peameal bacon, hash, regular bacon, cheese, and over easy eggs on top. It was delicious. My kids shared the simple menu of two eggs, bacon, tomatoes and toast. They were really generous with the toast and we got a whole basket of it. My husband got the eggs and hash, which were also really good. My husband got coffee so they came out with a carafe. The service here was also really good, with the exception of them forgetting our toast at first until we asked for it. 

I enjoyed every bite here, I think this place just needs to update their ambiance, which it looks like they're doing just that. It has a lot of potential to be a comfort place for many people."}
{"text":"This place SCREAMS tourist tourist tourist.  Nasty vibe - unfriendly and cold as granite.

Tried to seat me in the noisiest spot - asked to be seated at the bar.  Staff chattering behind the bar ignoring me or just not aware of anyone's presence.  Had to say \"can I get served\"?  Of course I got the chilly stare but who cares.  The beverage (blueberry/banana and orange smoothie) was good.  But after my experience today at lunch, where I was treated like a human being (my favourite Korean restaurant on Bloor), it was horrid having to actually ask for service at this place.

This place is close to the ROM, in the heart of tourist land.  They probably have regulars - who, no doubt, are treated ok.  Not my kind of place."}
{"text":"A decent option for breakfast foods all day near U of T.  I came here once with a huge appetite and ordered some heap of griddled potatoes, onions, ...., and topped with eggs.  I was rather full.  I wasn't particular impressed with anything, for it seems a lot like Denny's in quality and style.  The service was not particular good, but not horrible either.  The decor is homey and ignorable.  It's just a place to go hungry and leave not hungry."}
{"text":"i find the food here well made. the peameal bacon is tender. the consistency of the hollandaise is spot on. and they're generous with their coffee, which i'm always thankful for. 

service is spotty. sometimes okay. sometimes a bit rude. maybe i don't dress the yorkville way.

personally, i wouldn't say this is a tourist trap. the prices aren't outrageous. whenever i go i do see locals and regulars. 

the décor... what can be said about it? it desperately needs an update. it feels old, but without the charm of say dineen café or senator restaurant."}
{"text":"Like I said with my star rating, Over Easy is OK. They offer up your typical egg breakfast but also some more elaborate options like green onion, tomato, goat cheese scramble with your choice of fries, home fries or house salad. I'm a big big fan of home fries and if you are too, I  certainly recommend getting your fix elsewhere. The ones here are always dry and for some reason come with sauteed onions (which are amazing in all other dishes but this).  Also, some of their dishes seem over priced for what they are and the staff is pretty unremarkable. 

Good place to eat if you are simply looking for a one time change of scenes."}
{"text":"Located directly across the street from the ROM it is a good location for brunch. We were seated by the windows in the front and quickly served drinks. I opted for fresh orange juice and that was a real treat. Paired with my eggs in a hole meal I was so happy. A bagel topped with bacon and two eggs inside. Of course it was all topped with cheese. Side of home fries as well. This was the perfect meal before roaming through the museum all day."}
{"text":"This was close to our hotel so we thought we'd try it for breakfast before a morning seminar.
Ambiance inside is okay, nothing special, a little stuffy, but they do have decent size booths. Choose a patio table outside if available.
The waitress was very friendly and very chipper, and took our order and got us our drinks quickly. The food (eggs Benedict, French toast, steak and eggs) was good and reasonably priced. The downgrade on stars is because even though it was not very busy at 8am on Wednesday, it took a really long time to get our food, and then the entire time we were eating to get a refill on water despite our waitress walking past us several times.
Okay place, good food."}
{"text":"I had the Eggstro and my wife had the banana pancakes. I would definitely have that again. It was delicious. I'll give this place 3 1/2 stars as a breakfast diner with a great selection of items to choose from, including fresh squeezed orange and grapefruit juice."}
{"text":"2.5 star. 

Food - OK, 3 star
Service - 2 star
Everything else - 3 star

Overall, it's an OK option if you want breakfast at lunch time. It's near the office but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit here. 

The menu has plenty of options and I always struggle to make a choice. Typical breakfast food (eggs, bacon, pancakes, omelettes, fruit salad, cereals) along with lunch food (sandwiches, wraps, salads) are all served from 7am-4pm daily.

The service, as mentioned in previous reviews, is definitely hit-or-miss. Our server was very friendly on my recent visit but it took us ages to have someone seat us, despite the restaurant only being half full. Food came within a reasonable time (barely) but then it took us ages to flag her down for a bill and to pay.

Today I tried the California Omelette (asparagus, goats cheese, avocado, sundried tomato) with side salad for $9.99. Comes with toast which was absolutely slathered in butter. Had to sponge that shit off with a napkin, but the omelette was decent. Portion size ok but not big.

Their daily quiche is usually good."}
{"text":"This review is for the Over Easy located at 56 Young Street in the Hotel Victoria.

Randomly found this place after a quick web search for breakfast near our hotel, never heard of it before and as first timers in the big city, figured it was good as any to start the day.

We were greeted very warmly, staff is upbeat and will definitely brighten your morning.
Great selection of all breakfast foods you can think of. Was a bit overwhelmed with the choices as I'm not used to heavy meals before noon. I settled for the \"healthy light\" option which is yogourt and granola topped with lots of fruits and a muffin with a glass of freshly squeezed OJ.
My partner, by contrast, got a massive breakfast poutine.

Portions are generous, food is delicious and filling, just found it a tad too expensive.  2 plates, 2 juices and 1 coffee came up to 40$ for both of us. Stay away if you're looking for meals on a budget!"}
{"text":"First time there.  Very good deal.  Good quality , worth the price , its just that the service  is abit slow there if you are in rush , dont go there.  I will come back for sure"}
{"text":"Busy little place. The waiter was joking around with me which was nice and all the staff seems to help each other with all the tables. Coffee was great! I ordered poached eggs and they were cooked perfectly. Not too greasy either which is a huge plus for me."}
{"text":"Yummy English Breakfast. A little busy on a weekend but line moved quickly. Patio is great when sunny but bring sunglasses."}
{"text":"Great Location!  Great Food and selection.  Had the Montreal Smoked Meat Hash, awesomeness on a plate.  Their coffee was even good for a 'dinner'."}
{"text":"We stumbled across this place after visiting the ROM. Went for late lunch on a Saturday and didn't have to wait for a table, though it was pretty busy. Our server was nice. My son enjoyed his chocolate chip pancakes, though they were a little small for the price. Hubby liked his chicken/mushroom wrap, and I absolutely loved my Greek chicken wrap. Yum! The teeny little fries on the side were strange but tasty. Overall good lunch outing. We were pleased."}
{"text":"Not a fan. Menu is too large. Keep it simple. Hate the bits of greasy potatoes they call home fries. Service is lousy. A bunch of too cool for school students who hate being there. What's with the weird coffee pots they bring to the table? Why don't you come and pour me my coffee  you dickweed."}
{"text":"From the time is stepped into this palace things were not good. The restaurant was moderately busy but it took an abnormally long time to be shown to a seat. Where was the hostess at the door? Oh there isn't one, you just wait until a server isn't too busy with his/her section to seat you.

Once seated, I had enough time to browse the ridiculously large menu, figure out what I wanted, text a few people, and answer an email or two before the server even came over to see if I wanted anything to drink. For some reason my table was the only one off on its own form the rest of the servers section, though there was another server at the tables right beside mine who completely ignored me when I tried to get her attention.

The one good thing about my visit here was that once I had placed my order, the food came rather quickly. I ordered the heurvos rancheros. What I received was a hot mess on a tortilla with a side of home fries. Under a disgustingly huge pile of cheese was a heap of something like salsa, and two eggs buried somewhere in there. There was a large amount of sour cream on the side also to drown whatever this was in. Other reviewers rave about the home fries. Why? They weren't good. They were ok, but not something I would be telling all my friends about. It seems to me that they're a bag of frozen processed things fried and/or baked.

Frankly, I would try this place again and would try something else, but the service was just so terrible. I don't think its the fault of the servers, they were busting their asses. It seems like the restaurant is run very lean. There was no hostess and no busser. Those tasks were left up to the servers which were already at their capacity seeing to their full sections."}
{"text":"This place is definitely worth the wait and worth going to. It's across the street from the museum. We went for Sunday brunch and it was really packed. We had to wait out the door for a bit.
I got the smoked salmon eggs benedict and my friend got the eggs in a hole and we finished our plates very quickly. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the home fries were amazing. I also love that I can get Mill Street Brewery beer here!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome for breakfast. They have a HUGE menu and I loved the diner feeling I got with the decor. We got in around 10 am on a Sunday and we're seated right away, however when we left there was a line of people waiting so I'd recommend getting there early. The location is in a high traffic area, lots of hotels around, so it is very convenient if your in town for vacation. The food was very good, came out quick and hot, and the service we received was unparalleled. Our server, Gio, was so polite and attentive, he definitely made a good impression on us. Overall I was beyond satisfied with my experience at Over Easy and will visit again when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Seriously? We ordered a Greek omelet.  Two tiny hunks of barely warm feta, chunks of nearly raw onion. The eggs were either pre made into pancakes and wrapped around the filling and  reheated or flipped in the pan and cooked on both sides folding filling on it on the plate. Not an omelet at all when the filling all falls out before your fork reaches your mouth. Asked for dry toast and it came slathered in butter. They did bring another basket right away, tho. The home fries taste great but are just diced up French fries and deep fried.  If you like French fries you will like these."}
{"text":"Went here a few times for breakfast while we were staying at a hotel down the street.  Good service and good food.  Lots of choices for a family of four with two young adults.Prices are reasonable for the area. It can get crowded if you don't get there by about 9 during the summer."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon Over Easy while looking for a breakfast spot close to the ROM. My SO and I were both pretty hungry, and the smells coming from this spot were enough to draw us in. 

When you walk in, it's pretty small, and you're likely to have to wait for a seat as it's pretty busy. The atmosphere is welcoming, and you don't mind a short wait while you take in all the amazing aromas. 

The fresh squeezed juice here is so yummy! I was not disappointed with the orange juice, so I'm sure the others would be just as delicious! I ordered the waffles with strawberries and homemade strawberry sauce, and my SO ordered the Eggs Benedict with avocado and tomato. The food wasn't quite what I expected - It was yummy, but it wasn't over-the-top knock your socks off. 

If you're heading to the museum for the day but don't want to stray too far for breakfast or lunch, check out this little spot. I wouldn't seek it out intentionally, but it's alright in a pinch."}
{"text":"Very large menu selection, and very reasonable prices, and the outside patio is nice.  I'm very picky about wanting my eggs well done, and bacon soft and greasy - and I don't always get it this way, but today the waitress was a champ!  And it was nice to be able to get fries rather than their fried potato chunks.

I only wish the food stayed warmer longer while out on the patio."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast place!  Great location and reasonably priced fire the neighbourhood. 
Kid friendly and very accommodating"}
{"text":"Over Easy is VERY hit and miss. Sometimes the three egg special is perfect, other times the eggs are hardly even cooked. I've had an equal number of soggy fried tomatoes and perfectly crisped hash browns. Sometimes the service is outstanding, other times it's abrasive or completely lacking.

One thing is for sure, it's always crowded so be sure to arrive early. Understandably it's very popular with families and tourists because of its proximity to the ROM and Bata Shoe Museum, so if you don't like having a stroller butted up against your chair or listening to chatty or wailing kids, you might do best to go elsewhere. Also not ideal for large groups. The menu is massive so there are heaps of options for any sort of meal you're in the mood for. The \"eggs in a hole\" option is very popular!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a quick, tasty meal before exploring the ROM and we found it! It was a classic, diner-like experience, with great service and a diverse menu. 

I ordered an egg in the hole, which is fried eggs on a bagel with cheese and bacon that's been broiled, and a side of home fries.  Despite the food being over broiled (it was burnt in parts), the food was very tasty and flavorful. The bagel was chewy and delicious, the eggs were well cooked and the bacon was nice and crispy. The home fries were good, but very basic. Don't expect a lot going on with the potatoes.

Overall a great experience before the museum. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"When I compare Over Easy with other places, maybe I don't find it my ultimate Sunday morning family breakfast place, but I'd definitely drop by with my pals for some home-style fries once in a while...

Everything is what you'd expect from a $10-$15 breakfast, and that's why I gave it 4-stars.

The waitresses are really nice and friendly, which is the kick start of a good morning.

Go with \"The Big Breakfast\" for ~$12 if you're hungry, and I'm telling you, you'd be pretty full by the end of it you wouldn't want lunch!"}
{"text":"The portions are good, service is good, hygiene is good,  it's an overall great brunch spot. I like how their menu has healthy veggie options, and also has options for those looking to stuff their face... I believe one dish comes with: beans, bacon, sausage, French toast, pancakes... yea... huge! Great Mexican disses too. Their hollandaise sauce is also a favourite of mine."}
{"text":"Super nice staff and clean/bright environment. Same family as Museum Tavern. Good breakfast, prompt, and decent diner style food. Good for the family."}
{"text":"All the food is great and everything is made with quality ingredients! Also best mimosas in the city hands down. Service is usually good too especially if you're lucky enough to get Wade as your server, he's so friendly and accommodating, I'm not sure if he's the manager or not but he should be! The only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because the food is kinda inconsistent, still good but inconsistent with ingredients and stuff. Maybe they have a lot of turn over in the kitchen or something..."}
{"text":"I recently stayed at the Hyatt and was looking for a place to enjoy breakfast. After stumbling upon \"OverEasy\", I thought why not? I was immediately intrigued by their Breakfast Poutine and fresh squeezed orange juice. 

The OJ was delicious, but a smaller portion than I expected for the price. The Breakfast Poutine was impressive, but the eggs were over-poached. The location has a diner like ambience, but the tables were far too close for my liking."}
{"text":"Was staying over at the intercontinental and wanted to experience something local, we came over to overeasy and food was great, i had breakfast putin and will great. Would recommend
Time of visit 9am."}
