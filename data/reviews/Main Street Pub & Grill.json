{"text":"This place use to be my favorite place in Mount Horeb to eat. Since the new owners took over not so much. We have been sitting here for 30+ minutes with no food. I will find another place to go next Friday night. Not impressed!!!"}
{"text":"Best food ever. Great service. Chicken sandwich for me with a special sauce the chef concocted today. Absolutely awesome. Randy had a burger special also wonderful. The pub chips were great. Stop in."}
{"text":"Great food, try the bourbon grilled chicken sandwich really good, and the big onion rings. Good service for lunch."}
{"text":"Awesome 1/3lb. Ground chuck burgers, hot crinkle fries and 1.50 ice tea. 
Best lunch value I've had in quite a while."}
{"text":"Local pub on Main Street Mount Horeb.  
Food is greasy but tasty if you've already had a beer.
Variety of daily specials pending the day.
Upstairs is a slew of sporty activities if that is your thing, pool, foosball, darts, etc...extra tables and chairs.
On a recent night out we ended up here and the place was rocking with 80's Karaoke.  Interesting younger crowd singing along to songs way before their time.
Solid bar menu + beer and liquor specials."}
{"text":"Great burgers and friendly staff. I parked right on Main Street and it was free! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Horrible food and worse service. Waitress got several orders wrong,  including a simple hamburger. Beer was just ok. Overcooked chips, wrong dipping sauce. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"It was a very interesting dining experience to say the least. There was a fight between two women. Later, two patrons were going at it between the pool tables upstairs, which was displayed prominently to the rest of the bar on the security cameras. The wings were good though and they played some George Michael. All in all - thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. I go here quite a bit after work with friends, and the service is great. It's a VERY nice alternative to the Grumpy Troll (this town doesn't have a lot of dinner joints) - and it's inexpensive, too! 

They're not a brewery, but they do have craft beers on tap, and their liquor selection is interesting (there are some different kinds of Irish whiskey I'm looking forward to trying when I reconcile with whiskey again).

As far as drinks, I'm a simple gal: I order vodka with ginger beer or split a pitcher with pals.

The burgers here are standout - any one will do, and fill you up nicely and taste dern good while you're eating it. You can also get some really nice sides with it (I'm partial to the French onion soup!).

Bathrooms are one-holers that are clean and well-stocked. There's a dresser with drawers that would double nicely as a changing table, too. I've seen many families with kids come in for dinner. However, I don't think there are any tables that are standard height - they're all barstool height, so that may be a factor with little ones.

Park in the \"secret\" public lot off the street right behind the place: It's much easier to get in and out of vs. on-street."}
{"text":"when in wisconsin, do as the wisconsiner's do. it's a saturday night, you've finished all the beer at your house, time to hit the bar! my aunt, friend and i hiked underneath the stars to the pub, me spellbound by the sight above me. chicago nights will never produce  a stellar view like you'll get in the country. out of the handful of bars to choose from, i recommend this one for two reasons. 1. highest population of people in their 20's/30's. 2. karaoke! nothing special on drinks. inexpensive compared to chicago standards. the apps and entrees seem above the average, but that may just be how i read it off the menu (didnt try anything).  friday and saturday are karaoke nights! don't know how this place is on weekdays, but weekends can bring in a packed house of predominately the younger crowd and the rest of mt. horeb's singles. be prepared to squeeze through! have a few drinks, mingle  and by god...karaoke!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Main Street Pub and Grill in Mt Horeb. We asked while shopping at Duluth Trading, where to enjoy a great sandwich for lunch and they referred us to Main Street Pub & Grill. I tried the lunch special, Southwestern/ Grilled Chicken salad - it was excellent - delicious meld of ingredients and flavors, I enjoyed it. She had the deep fried cod sandwich and onion rings - again, equally as delicious. served on a flavorful ciabatta roll with perfectly deep fried, large sliced onion rings. I enjoyed a Karben4 - NightCall Smoked Porter - which reflected a nice selection of \"tap\" beers. I would mention my server by name but she never introduced herself as she busied with chores, even though we were the only ones sitting at the bar - the chef was kind enough to ask if we liked our food. Overall I extend high marks to the food, and can't really do the same for service, mind you, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't cheerful and friendly either - which I tend to expect in smaller community, hometown bars. If you are looking for some delicious food the next time you visit Mt Horeb, give Main Street Pub and Grill a try - I'd be interesting in hearing your opinion"}
{"text":"This was choice #2 for the night. Drove by Grumpy Troll, and saw there was no parking, so we assumed a long wait due to a large crowd. We spied this place on the way to Grumpy, so we headed back. We were seated right away, as it was self seating. The waitress was very hurried, gave us menus without asking if we wanted something to drink. After what seemed like too long of a wait, she took our drink and food order. It came fairly fast, and while not stellar, it was satisfactory. Good fish, I had hash browns with cheese and onions as a side, OK cole slaw, the standard oh-so-soft dinner roll that could be easily compacted to the size of a pea. I would return for the fish, but may also try their burgers."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a beer and a burger.  I felt brave so I ordered The Big Duluth Burger which had beef and bratwurst patties with pepperjack, bacon and onions. My Burger and my husband's bratwurst were cooked barside and we're delicious!  Juicy and very flavorful. Highly recommend this joint!"}
{"text":"Food was good but the service was horrible. I bought some pull tabs and got a couple of small dollar winners and I waited for 10 minutes to get my cash. And the thing is it was slow so it's not like they are busy. I would not recommend going there the"}
{"text":"Staff is always friendly.  Meat Raffle and Wing night on Thursday night is always fun.  Great burgers and grilled cheese!"}
{"text":"Nice people, average food.  Ambiance is fairly straightforward, a bar, some TVs, a lot of promotional beer items on the walls.  Good for a quick bite to eat, but nothing overly exciting going on here."}
