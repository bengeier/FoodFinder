{"text":"I had one of the best doner wraps here! It is a small place. A lot of people seem to get takeout. The prices are reasonable. I would stay away from the baklava though as I found it a bit dry..."}
{"text":"There was a hair in my shawarma wrap.  Black and about an inch (I have long blond hair).   I showed the owner (man in his late 50s or early 60s with glasses) and he took it over the counter and pulled it off and wiped it on his apron and put the sandwich back and denied there was a hair.  I said he wiped it off and he started yelling saying eat your sandwich and you're not getting your money back.  Only after me waiting for 2 min as I had only ate two bites he basically threw it in my hands and yelled at me to get out.  What a horrible person.  I do NOT recommend this place.  It was cheap but the two bites I had weren't very good and the owner is horrible."}
{"text":"Love their dinner combos. It's very filling. The meat is always very tender and the sauce is awesome. The family who operates this place is very friendly"}
{"text":"Love this place! I always get the Chicken or Veal with rice and the sauce they put on it is amazing. The family who runs it are great people as well. It'll be a sad day when they close down due to yet another condo."}
{"text":"This place is a staple with my family. My husband and I are willing to drive over 40 km and brave Toronto traffic JUST to eat this Donair. Their mixed dinner plate is all we get. The rice/veal/chicken/hotsauce/garlic/salad combination is perfect. My husband has been eating here for years. Our friends and our friends friends love it. Especially when the dad is serving (usually later in evening) for some odd reason the way he puts the plate together with his wife just tastes a million times better.  And please this is NOT shawerma- this is donair!!!! I swear the donair in Turkey is not this deadly!"}
{"text":"My go to take-out spot for dinner when my fridge is empty and I don't feel like cooking or spending a lot on dinner.   The  super friendly service  at this family owned place more than makes up for the fresh and decent tasty sandwiches.  Their falafel is not too oily and the hot sauce is yum.   Best dinner would be sandwiches fro Donair Kebob house and humus from Paramount down the street."}
{"text":"Large portions, reasonable prices, and a very different taste from the usual Shawarma joints."}
{"text":"Always a favorite - good prices, generous portions and the family that runs it is lovely."}
{"text":"Best best best shawarma in town..  It tastes different than the all other shawarma places in town.   ive been eating so many time for the past few years years and i still always get watery mouth whenever i think about it"}
{"text":"Best place ever! First time i stepped into that place was 7 years ago, after clubbing it used to be open back then.. I went for the mixed plate with the hot sauce and lots of garlic sauce!   The family that owns this place cares about each customer they serve. They know that if they serve you the food properly, the taste of it will surely bring you back! I live in north york, and EVERYTIME I'm anywhere close to downtown i stop  by just to grab a plate.   The father is a superfunny old man, can talk to you on any topic if he isnt bussy!   If you are ever in the area, trying the food they serve is a MUST. I wish it was closer to my place!!!!   Have a good meal everyone!"}
{"text":"I was eating at Doner for almost 5 years, all my ryerson days. The  food is amazing but for students, kinda pricey plus they never have specials."}
{"text":"Good veal and chicken on rice. I like the combination of white sauce and hot sauce, as well as the rice taste good.  The only reason why I did not give this place a 5* is because it's $8.50 for the veal and chicken on rice.  Would definitely recommend this place to others.  One tip: Come early as the outer part of the meat are the best, and it is served for whomever comes first...  =)"}
{"text":"I am always impressed by the quality of the food here. The hot sauce is a unique flavour that I've never had anywhere else. This is now my go-to place for kebabs in Toronto and I've been there like 10 times in the last six months.  Also, I have to say that the owners are so nice and really give it a homey feel.   I usually get the mixed meat plate and share it with my boyfriend. It's more than enough for the two of us! Great for a hangover."}
{"text":"$9 for a chicken plate with rice. Portion tend to be smaller than other in the area. Thus it doesn't come with any veggie.  I had such a high expectation seeing the average is 4 stars from yelp. Disappointed!  The chicken is ok, nothing special."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place during my time at Ryerson. I must say, this place opened up my taste buds to Shawarma and since then I have yet to find a place that is better!  The sauces are AMAZING. The sauce is so good they wont even sell it seperately lol I've asked before they said no, but were awesome enough to give me a bit for free to take home."}
{"text":"I had pretty much stopped eating donair kebabs/shawarmas because I haven't been able to find anything good in my niehgbourhood since A La Turque was good oh so man moons ago. But I had a craving and Yelp steered me here.  I may be letting my expectations colour my review, but I was very underwhelmed. For a Turkish-style kebab it was missing a key ingredient - pickled cucumber. The garlic sauce was so-so and there wasn't any chili. They also didn't finish it off with a minute under the press to heat up the pita.  It's not a bad quick snack if you happen to be passing by, but my search for a solid traditional Turkish donair continues..."}
{"text":"I came here again from request of the chicken dinner plate, around 7$ with tax and it was really good compared to the shawarma sandwich they had. The plate was amazing, I've never tasted a sauce like it - sweet and garlic and you must get the hot sauce. When you mix it all up it's truly an amazing meal. Come here for the chicken shawarma plate - good call yelpers."}
{"text":"Found this little place thru my friends. Donair sandwiches are small but satisfying. And their sauces work together to make an amazingly tasty doner! Have become a regular!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall nearby a stripping club.  Walked past by here late last night after all night drinking.  Feel sudden crave for a wrap as late night snack so divide to grab a chicken sandwich.  I'd say it doesn't look impressive outside and I had passed by many times without trying it.  After trying out their sandwich, I actually thought that was pretty not bad.  Better than many places I've had.  Although the chicken is a bit dry, sauce adds a punch to it.  I actually should have requested more sauce... As for the portion, it tends to be small but it's enough for a late night snack.  As for the price, it's $7 bucks after tax... Reminds me how I miss the days when chicken shawarma costed $5 bucks incl. tax."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the past 6 years and their chicken shawarma never disappoints! Great for a quick bite to eat during lunch and very filling."}
{"text":"This has got to be one of the best Doner Kebab places in town. The staff are very friendly and nice. Although the space looks a bit sketchy, the food quality and taste is really good!. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"It's an average doner (shawarma) place. Friendly staff. But they need to work on their décor. It's a quite depressing atmosphere, dark, quite, playing no music or tv and piles and piles of drinks stacked along the wall on one side of the shop."}
{"text":"Just found this place and its a gem! It's a small family run joint and the food definitely tastes homemade - really satisfying on those late nights. Personal favourite is the potatoes and garlic sauce, everything just goes so well together and the rice is amazing! Would recommend y'all to try this place out if you're nearby"}
{"text":"I tried this place based on the reviews here and I must say the reviews I read for this place were total bs.  Here is a real review.  I ordered the mixed chicken/veal dinner plate & I was NOT happy.  The amount of meat the server gave me was so small I wasn't even full after.  He gave me so much rice & only a little bit of chicken/veal.  On the upside I did like the veal and the sauce.    My husband got two chicken donair wraps and he thought it was dry; the chicken was hard & the portions small.  He complained all throughout the meal.  I tried his wrap and I agree it was dry and a bit bland.   We were both still hungry after we ate & our bill totaled $28.  You would think that if you paid that kind of money you would get a meal that fills you.  Besides, I know about a gazillion other places that will fill me for that kind of money.  We both ate again when we got home."}
{"text":"It's awesome! 2sodas plus 2 dinner just $24.5. I gave 4star because the shop was very small and they accepted only cash!"}
{"text":"we came here with my friends and met this good people this is really number one if you are hungry so much try the plate its about 11 dollars and standart durum is for normal size it has a little bit spice but certainly RIGHT PLACE FOR DURUM KEBAB"}
{"text":"My favourite shawarma place downtown. The wraps are tasty and the dinner plates are to die for. Make sure you get all the sauces, tahini and hot sauce. I usually get extra tahini as it is just irresistible.  It is a family owned business so they are very nice and friendly every time they see you. The seating could be a bit better, but with food this good I can't complain."}
{"text":"The salesman is so rude! I was suprised with his treatment! I asked him for a Halal certificate, and got so mad, and asked me to leave th place and dont come back!! This is th rule, if u says th food is Halal then u gotta hv a certificate, nothing to be mad abut!!"}
{"text":"I have a sweet spot for whole in the wall run by a family.   I've also been craving a doner for quite some time. Although the doner did not compare to the ones you get in Europe, it was still very delicious and ayran complimented the meal well."}
{"text":"The place is very small but they have Very tasty and fresh shawarma sandwiches.  I prefer to take away. They don't accept cards payments but they have an ATM."}
{"text":"I've been to this place for many years and never once disappointed. Doner Kebab is a Turkish street food that is similar to Arab Shawarma but very different taste at the same time, so don't mix up the two"}
{"text":"One of the best price/value lunches you can get in the area.  I go here all the time for lunch and walk up from Yonge/Dundas."}
{"text":"I've only ever tried their veal/chicken plate and I like how you can do half veal half chicken for the same price. It's $10 flat including tax. Cash only. Their hot sauce has a very unique flavour that I can't really put my finger on. It's sort of tangy, tomatoey and spicy all at once. So delicious and filling."}
{"text":"This is a good Kebab or Döner or whatever you want to call it.  It's $7.69 for the sandwich which is good size.  I got the chicken and asked for it spicy.  Good red sauce but not too spicy.  The guy at the counter was friendly and helpful.  The place won't be turned into condos until late 2018 he said.   Yay!  Cash only..."}
{"text":"okay so I feel IN LOVE with the \"street\" food of chicken and rice in NYC. to the point where it was almost consumed everyday when I was last there.  so once my obsession settled in, I was told about how amazing Doner house is. And I have to say, their chicken on rice is probably the closest I've gotten to NYC food. Their spicy red sauce and white garlic sauce has so much flavour it is just delicious. the location is small, and don't have crazy expectations of the way it looks, and don't just a book by its cover - the food is slamming!   I've walked here for King & Bay during the winter just to get my fix. it is totally worth it, and for those who eat only halal meat- this joint would be perfect for you!   clearly I am a regular that will keep returning :)   oh and it seems like a family owned business, never ever have I received bad service nor have I heard anyone else say something bad! it's definitely a gem in the city!"}
{"text":"Great, friendly service and good food at a good price. My sister brought me here one night after work because of her love for this place. We both ordered the mixed doner dinner with extra rice and garlic sauce and no salad. Unfortunately, they didn't have any chicken ready at the time so we were told we would have to wait unless we wanted all veal instead. This was fine with us since we were hungry and wanted to eat sooner than later. I definitely want the mix next time I go though."}
{"text":"This place has been around for ages - and for good reason - it's cheap, tasty, plentiful, simple and the service is great.  I get the mixed veal and chicken dinner platter (comes with meat, rice, potato, salad and slaw) since the portion is so big, I can eat it for lunch over 2 days.  The meat is always tender and I enjoy every bite.  I highly recommend getting the hot sauce - it is not overly spicy but has such a great flavour that compliments the dish just right.  It's a no-brainer good old-fashion cheap eats joint."}
{"text":"First of all the people working here are amazing. Second of all, best kebabs I have ever had. They are well seasoned, cooked properly, and juicy. If i had to choice one place to eat for the test of my life, it would be this place. Also their falafel's are out of this world"}
{"text":"Their mixed rice with garlic and hot sauce is the best hangover meal ever.  It's so good and so easy it's become my go-to meal.  Just wish the price stayed at $7 or so...  $9 is a little bit of an overkill... But I still keep coming back at least once a week!  They could use a little renovation anytime now."}
{"text":"Hello All I have to say is   HOT SAUCE GARLIC SAUCE EXTRA HOT SAICE GARLIC SAUCE  I've been coming here for 10 yeas now all the way from Bathurst and Shepard area Family runner business but the father is such a character lol Bottom Line  Best hot sauce in Ontario"}
{"text":"Rudest staff i have encountered in a long time.  I wanted to pay for my food by debit card as i didn't have enough cash, however, i was pointed to the little sign on the wall saying 'cash only', then i was told that i can take out money from their ATM machine that charges $2 for withdrawals. I told them that how could i see the little sign from the outside before i entered the building and why i wasn't warned before i ordered my food.  Every restaurant or take out place has debit machines especially on Yonge street. The extra $2 charge for having to withdraw cash from their ATM isn't the end of world but its the principle of it and the inconvenience to the customers. No matter what i said to them they kept raising their voice back at me and pointing to the cash only sign.  Seems like they are big into taking cash to hide their money for tax purposes. Eventually they gave me $2 off my food as i was going to walk out.  Extremely rude staff and i would never go back there.  I have no idea why people are raving about the food, it is very average, i had to spit out some hard pieces and fat from my chicken.  My advice for them is to invest in a debit machine for customer convenience, not everyone carries cash around and work on their customer service.  You do not give attitude back to a customer for any reason.  My most horrible food experience in a long long time."}
{"text":"I had higher expectations based on all the rave reviews. I had the beef shawarma  sandwich and while the taste was okay, it was tougher than I've ever had before, and the four falafel I ordered on the side were a bit dry. Extremely nice family runs the place. I made a special trip out to give it a try, but wouldn't go out of my way again. If you're in the area? It's nice meal, although a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Food - 5 Drinks - 4 (no alcohol) Staff - 4 Service - 5 Décor - 1 (but what can you expect) Atmosphere - 5 (mom 'n pop shop) Cleanliness - 3 Portion - 5 Price-Point - 5  Must-Tries: - chicken platter includes rice, potato, salad, slaw, your choice of chicken or veal or mixed (for me it's all about the white sauce!! extra extra sauce!!) - homemade hot sauce is tangy and not too spicy"}
{"text":"The best shawarma place in Toronto. I used to go here twice a day when I went to Ryerson. Great food for those on a tight budget. The chicken is so juicy and their garlic sauce and hot sauce are great. It does taste different from most other shawarma but in a good way. This family has been running the place for more than a decade and they're really nice and friendly."}
{"text":"A for effort. F for quality. It's rather tasteless and with dry chicken. Oh well. Off to the next place to find a shawarma"}
{"text":"While walking down Yonge St on a cold and rainy April day ( snow on the ground on April 17th....geez !! )  the hunger pains started to kick in....just as I was passing the \"Doner Kebab House\" strangely enough !! Being English, as soon as you show me \"Doner Kebab\" i'm transported to 1am Doner feedings after 10 pints, but seeing as those days are behind me and I live in the States now I'm always hankering for a Doner. I walked in and was warmly greeted, the menu is pretty basic and I decided to go for the Doner Plate ( Veal ) as I was quite hungry and the wrap simply wasn't going to cut it. Food was ready fairly quickly and I paid my $15 with a drink and sat down. After tucking in, the 1am Kebab run memories from England didn't come rushing back as this certainly wasn't even close, but the food itself was good enough that I didn't care.  Fresh Ingredients, flavorful Veal and rice and a sauce that i'm not sure it's origins but I was sold !! Recommended to try for sure"}
{"text":"Let's face it, this place looks like a total dump from the outside....so it took me ages to actually try it out.  On the recommendation from a friend, I finally popped in today.  I had a chicken kebab which was great.  A little too saucy, in my opinion.  Attempt to eat with caution.  I think next time I might try the veal, or a plate instead.  That looked even better.  In a sea of mediocre shawarma and kebab places in the area, this one is a real stand out."}
{"text":"They don't do fresh falafel. Boo. They fry up a big batch and leave it sad and cold during the day."}
{"text":"From reading the reviews here, both my partner and I opted for the mixed chicken/veal rice (without any vegetables because it's just coleslaw and costs an extra $2). I personally thought the food was mediocre but my partner thought it was below average.   Neither of the two meats were tender, the rice was a little hard (my partner suspected it was one day old rice), and the $10 price was not worth it. It was a filling portion but I could get a similar size box for less than $8 at the Roti Roll Caribbean Cuisine just down the street (and although it's a completely different cuisine altogether, the food there is by far much more delicious).   With all the great options nearby, I will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"you can feel that it's a family owned restaurant the moment you step in this donair. warm smiles and friendly greetings that's what awaits you from the very first moment.  oh and the food is good too. and so I was told that their garlic sous is the in-house special so go for it. it's good.   hot sauce is actually hot so go for it too!=) the falafel I got was yummy and the prices are cheap so when hungry and on the run will consider stopping here."}
{"text":"2 words: Veal shawarma. As far as I know this is the only place with veal shawarma. It tastes better and more tender than regular beef shawarma. Not the largest portion, but more than adequate to fill me up. Prices are reasonable.   This is very much a mom and pop shop. It's not very nice for dine-in. But it's perfect for take out."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked inside, the bubbly owner started chatting with me. He and his wife were very friendly and told me about how they have been in business for 13 years and that they are from Turkey.   I had the chicken dinner plate and it was quite good, but I can't say I was a fan of the homemade hot sauce that was drizzled all over the chicken and rice (see photo). The owner told me that it was homemade, but it tasted more on the sweet side, much like ketchup, not hot and spicy. The chicken dinner plate came with salad and one potato and it was quite satisfying. For $11, I think it was a little steep.  The interior of the place is a little rough around the edges and there's not much seating. The owner assured me that I would come back. Let's see if he's right!"}
{"text":"Doner Kebab House is hearty, hungry heman stuff for students and workers alike downtown.   Get the mixed plate here and you'll leave feeling satiated and thankful you have a tummy of steel to absorb all the flavours and textures.   Juicy, crispy shavings of chicken and beef top a bed of rice, greek style potatoes, raw onions and a pedestrian salad but what really sends this thing into overdrive are the homemade sauces-creamy, sweet white sauce to the sea of fiery red hot sauce that owner is justifiably proud of. My colleagues and I like to joke that he snaps when you ask for extra hot sauce on the side-a donair nazi if you will."}
{"text":"If you go to Ryerson University... Consider yourselves the luckiest of the bunch. This is honestly the best food ever!! Get all the sauces and then when he's done putting, ask for extra sauce! The sauce is the secret to this place! Its cash only! That's the really annoying part. But friendly staff, and amazing food just tops it! You gotta eat here!!!"}
{"text":"The thing about Turkish food is the sauce.   I've had Turkish food in restaurants all over the world and say quite consistently that it is my favourite food. In my experience Turkish food is always defined by the sauce recipe of the family that makes it no matte how hole-in-the-wall it is or upscale. The chef/cooks family recipe seems to define whether its horrible or amazing.   And this place. I've avoided writing a review about this place cause well they're doing just fine with out the internet. I'm pretty sure the place across the street opened up (the one with the red and white sign) cause of how good this place became to be known. Not.Even.Close.  This place has a really basic menu that has everything you want. I'm talking about the veal with rice. spicy. all the sauces. Thats it. Fine the chicken is really good too but its about the sauce.   When this husband and wife couple opened this restaurant in 2002ish I was halfway through Ryerson and they kept me coming there almost daily cause that buttery rice and the sauce was so damn good with veal or chicken. Take a hike salad.No room for you! Anyways fast forward over a decade later in many different countries and cities lots of Turkish food later and when I moved back to Toronto. The sauce is still exactly the same and turns out its the best I've been able to find. In this city. In this country. On this continent. In this hemisphere. In the other hemispheres. Anywhere. Just he best I have ever had. They had a son or nephew in his teens when I went while in school. I hope they taught him the recipe. cause that stuff is so good not to pass down. Oh and uhhh, Internet, don't go there, yeah they're busy, with umm stuff."}
{"text":"This place was my staple place to get dinner when I was at Ryerson. The day I first discovered it, I had Lunch, then went back to get take out to bring it home for dinner!  I think what gets me is their sauce. yumm. I haven't anything that matches to this place. My favourite is the veal on rice."}
{"text":"Giving it five stars because it's quick, hits the spot, and the old couple that runs the place is adorable. Got a mixture of chicken and veal, and it was everything you could ever ask for a mediocre shawarma place at a quick and modest price.   5/5 for Toronto and to the couple that runs the place. 3/5 in comparison to Shawarma Palace in Ottawa doe (THAT PLACE is the shit, really.)"}
{"text":"Honestly I crave the food from this place specifically, they have this awesome hot spicy/garlic sauce and it really makes the food awesome!  I usually get rice, potatoes, and a mix of meat, with sauce.  I Highly recommend if you want something fast and easy.  Probably not that healthy, but definitely yummy and the taste is killer ;)"}
{"text":"The best meat and sauce combo in downtown. Much respect and love for the family that works there.   Advise: please accept credit/debit. Its much more convenient."}
{"text":"Yesterday I was just looking on yelp for a restaurant in Toronto and I found this wonderful shawarma place so I decided to give it a try. I ordered the Chicken with Rice and I was blown away by how tasty my first bite was! The garlic sauce and hot sauce was magical. I only had one other shawarma place that I really love called Pita Nutso, and this one is definitely up to that level :D will come back again for sure!"}
{"text":"I cannot tell you how AMAZING their hot sauce is. I've been coming here for years! The restaurant is family run and they are the nicest people you will ever meet! I always get the chicken shawarma plate with falafel (make sure to ask for extra hot sauce)! Absolutely delicious! Just thinking about it makes my mouth water!"}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall run by a very nice married couple. They are here everyday of the week and have setup very modest Mediterranean/ Middle East shop in the the heart of Yonge st. the chicken on rice is served with love. Pricing is competitive but COME with CASH they have no debit. The decor is stuck in the past but at least his flavours aren't."}
{"text":"I travel all the way from Brampton to Toronto just for this shawarma place!! Best place ever by far!!"}
{"text":"Tried the Checken Doner based on everyone's feedback. I was hoping for more, however I left this place feeling utterly unimpressed. Doner is the Turkish version of a Shawarma for anyone not familiar.  The chicken pita had girth but was packed with lettuce and little chicken. Apart from that, the chicken didn't have much flavour.  They tried to compensate for lack of flavour with the garlic sauce, however that did not sit well on my palate."}
{"text":"Had the chicken shwarma plate.  Shwarma was good! Salad was decent. However the hot sauce wasn't hot at all, and was kind of sweet. Was ok at first but by the time I finished my meal it kind of turned on me. Not my bag. The hot sauce really makes a shwarma for me, and this I did not like at all.  So it was good and I'm sure a lot of people will enjoy it, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch (takeout). Got the chicken shawarma sandwich for $6.50 with tax. Sign said cash only. Food was average tasting. The garlic sauce was way too runny to be put in a sandwich. Most of it leaked out of the bottom of the shawarma. The sandwich was not toasted after being prepared. Quite messy to eat."}
{"text":"Ruddest staff. Asked the owner if the food was Halal and he got all mad and started yelling. If your food is halal then you should have no problem showing a certificate, it's a common practice at all halal restaurants."}
{"text":"The restaurant  may look grungy but it's the best I ever had! Strongly recommend getting half veal half chicken. It's the best!"}
{"text":"This place has the best hot sauce, whole other league from any other shawarma place. It's more tart than spicy and you'll regret it if you don't ask for extra. You also wouldn't understand why the other reviews are so positive if you don't get the hot sauce. Coming here and not getting hot sauce is like asking for your steak cooked well done  I always get the mixed beef and chicken shawarma dinner, which comes with a potato, rice, and salad (which isn't just iceberg lettuce). Not typically a fan of salad but mixing this in gives a nice crunch  Been coming here for years, will really miss it when it's gone"}
{"text":"Limited menu but the donars are amazing!  The sauce is homemade and delicious.  I come here every time I come down to this area in Toronto.    My favorite donars in town.."}
{"text":"Doner Kebab is getting to be a rare find along the ever-changing (increasingly in demand) Yonge and Dundas area. It's relatively cheap, but still a delicious and filling meal from a local establishment. They serve up chicken and lamb kebab in a variety of rice, salad and wrap options.  I stopped by for a super late lunch and the server jumped up from a nearby table to put together my order. I went the half and half (chicken and lamb) dinner plate (served with rice and a potato). It was liberally doused with white sauce, and they gave me just a bit of hot sauce on the side when they noticed my initial hesitance over the red stuff. I exchanged the box of $11.50 and was out the door in under 5 minutes.  The meat to carb ratio is excellent, with plenty of meat for each bite of rice or potato. Admittedly, it's a little heavy for a lunch meal if you finish the whole box in a sitting. Throw in a salad and it can easily be stretched out for two meals!"}
{"text":"The best Turkish food in town! The restaurant is a little hole in the wall, but the food and service is spectacular! The owners are super sweet, welcoming and helpful! We were very indecisive when it came to ordering and they went ahead and explained the all the dishes to us and prepared it to our liking (some of us didn't want spicy or slaw). I ordered the veal sandwich which was only $6.47. We liked the actual food so much that we will be going back tomorrow :)! Cheap and good! Don't let the looks fool you, please go in and just try the food, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Don't be turned off by the location, since the eatery is nestled between a few sex shops & an adult theater. The food here is quick, delicious, and incredibly satisfying. Also, the owner is so funny and personable - like most Turks are. I'm surprised this spot doesn't have more reviews. This is the perfect place to grab some authentic Doner."}
{"text":"Doner Kebab is a great place to get good shawarmas, shawarma plates, and falafel. Its consistently good for a good price. It is close to where I work and I go there often. I have actually been going there since I was in University. The portion is big enough for me to eat at work and have extra to take home. Love the garlic and spicy sauce."}
{"text":"Best Donair in the City!!!    They offer chicken or veal pitas, as welp as fresh falafel.   The tomatos are fresh, lettuce is crisp, and the hot sauce burns deep and slow.  The garlic sauce is creamy and tasteful, without being overpowering.  The owner makes each pita meticulously with fresh ingredients.    A sandwich is $7 but worth much more!!!  They also offer plates if you're very hungry.  We always get the veal pita."}
{"text":"Nothing special about it, tried it on a friend's recommendation. I mean it was good but nothing special. They don't have authentic doner kabab, they just sell the same shawarma roll and plate that everyone else sells."}
{"text":"Fast food joint for university students, owners were nice and prices were reasonable"}
{"text":"Great prices, great feedback from the loyal customers they have, cool place, good employees, cheap prices for down town Toronto, big big portions, i couldn't finish one sandwich of chicken shawarma, the garlic they use is creamy and light, the only disappointment is they had no iskender kebap if they had it this place would be perfect!"}
{"text":"I like the veal (don't think they have regular beef). the sauces are excellent and make the place. both the white sauce and the red sauce they use (got to get them both!). you can't go wrong with the sandwich but i recommend going for the plate. dash a little extra table hot sauce and your good to go! Great service too. It's a nice family run place.   Depending on how late you go they may not have chicken & veal (i think they stay open until they run out), but its all good :)"}
{"text":"Looking for some doner, or a quick 'middle eastern' food fix. This is the spot.  Kudos to the 'homemade hot sauce' I would use it as a condiment on other dishes.. such as burgers and would probably even buy some if they were to sell it.   Wait.. now that I think about it, I just go to this place for the hot sauce."}
{"text":"My go-to place after an intense workout. They're a small family run place. The food tastes great. Try the mix of chicken and veal if you're not sure which one to pick. I usually order the Dinner Platter and this is a relatively large portion that fills me up completely. Sometimes they run out of the veal though, if you go too late (past 9pm). I've been here over two dozen times and it's a nice hole in the wall place I like to take visitors from outside of Toronto."}
{"text":"The best chicken sandwich in Canada! Amazing people running the shop."}
{"text":"This place is a hole in the wall on the corner of Yonge and Gerrard, and most people probably walk by without noticing it. I went in on the recommendation of a friend and I was pleasantly surprised by how friendly the service was. They only accept cash, but they make sure you are aware of it prior to ordering so there is no conflict when it comes to paying.  The food however, was very subpar. I ordered the chicken and rice, and the chicken was flavourless but worst of all, it was smothered in a garlic sauce that didn't taste at all garlicky, and a hot sauce that was 90% sugar and only 10% heat. I felt very gross after eating the food, probably because of how oily and heavy the chicken, rice, and sauces were.   I don't want to give this place a very poor rating, as the service really is phenomenal and I believe they have better food than what I had last time. I will hopefully be returning again in the future to try some of their other menu options but in the meantime, I am leaving 3 stars and am warning people to try the sauces prior to ordering."}
{"text":"Been going here for years I know the family and watch there sons grow.there great people that make and serve fresh and the best doner in Toronto."}
{"text":"I went there on Jan 1 2016 for a late dinner take out with a friend. Nothing much was open in the Gerard/Yonge area given it was a national holiday.   I had the chicken on rice with the hot sauce and garlic sauce. I definitely did not think it was as good as the food trucks in Manhattan! It was a decent quantity for $10 (inc taxes) although it's $5.50 USD in NYC (which is close to $10 CAD these days). The meat wasn't great quality and the sauces didn't have too much flavor.  No salad or veggies on the side other than one large piece of potato (had some taste/flavor).   My friend ordered a falafel sandwich ($6 inc taxes) with \"everything\" on it which wasn't much. They only had lettuce, onions, tomatoes, garlic sauce, hot sauce (not very hot), pickles. I was shocked & disappointed there were no turnips! My friend said it tasted bland when we got the food home. And preferred my chicken and rice.  I felt a bit nauseated after from my chicken and rice but my friend felt fine so maybe it was something I had eaten earlier in the day.  I won't be going back unless in another desperate, late night situation (or stat holiday).   Food: I would give it 2.5 * for quality and enjoyment of food.   Ambience: 2* (recommend take out)   Service: 3* (husband and wife pair I'm guessing)   Bathroom: I don't know as I didn't use them"}
{"text":"Probably had lunch and dinner here around 100 times in the last ten years. Almost never have a bad meal. My favorite chicken shawarma dinner in the city. Nuff said."}
{"text":"My final visit to this place, I won't waste my time coming again. Do yourself a favour and completely ignore the star rating on this place - a cursory glance at the reviews show MANY suspect 5* reviews that are likely from people who do not exist.  For $10 even, I got a container with chicken, rice and half a potato. No vegetables in sight and no option to add them. Coleslaw doesn't count (for me) and its not on the plate I've got anyways. The chicken is good, its got some crispy bits and the sauces make it better. But the \"hot sauce\" seems tomato based, which is throwing my tastebuds off and the other sauce, the garlic sauce, is almost sweet and the texture of it is kind of gross. I feel like it might be mayo-based and its just not doing it for me. The potato was soaking in some kind of tomato mixture and is quite bland - I had some on my fork and just pushed it off because I honestly had no interest in eating any more of it. The rice is bland and boring, but that's to be expected.  This plate is not worth $10. If they'd charged me $6 or $7, I could see it. But rice is pennies a serving and so are potatoes. So you're basically charging me over $8 for chicken and sauce.  Take note that this place is CASH ONLY, that's why its taken me so long to come back as I rarely carry cash on me. They have an ATM but I'm sure it probably charges $2 to take out a $20.   Take your $10 across the street to Villa Madina and you'll get a plate that includes fresh veggies with a lot more flavour and much friendlier staff. I won't return."}
{"text":"I had a great experience here a few weeks back.  Their menu is limited, but the chicken doner was fantastic.  The homemade sauce was wonderful, and they were very friendly to me."}
{"text":"nothing too special about this place though their chicken sause is pretty good.   Their prices recently went up so keep that in mind for everyone who goes there every once in a while.   Service is fast and friendly but there is just nothing to give this place a kick up to the next level."}
{"text":"One of my fav spots for Middle Eastern food offers a simple menu. I typically get the dinner which has a choice of meat (chicken, veal, or ask for half and half to sound like a regular), rice, potatoes, and salad. Make sure you get extra white sauce (tastes like a yogurt-based garlic sauce) and red sauce (hot sauce). The white sauce is what really gets me coming back. It tastes light with a milky consistency and has a nice punch of sweet and garlic flavor that's not over powering although you probably shouldn't go to a meeting afterward. The meat needs the most improvement as I like those charred bits that other places tend to have. The sauce is good enough to make up for it though, meaning you could put that sauce on a shoe and I'd eat it. You can also just get meat and rice for a couple dollars less but I find the salad balances out everything and is yet another great way to savor the white sauce. The dinner portion is huge and should fill up even the hungriest of bellies. Decent but very cramped seating with all the tables basically stuck together and good luck trying to get past someone's chair. As this is right in the middle of downtown and the heart of Ryerson University land, I'm guessing it gets busy during lunch, but I've never been there where it's more than a 5 minute wait cause the service is quick and respectful. Located about halfway between College and Dundas subway stations."}
{"text":"Tried this place out today for lunch. Had their chicken and lamb Donair wrap. I was quite impressed and the quality was definitely there - especially for the price I paid. I would recommend this place to anyone looking to get some decent Donair downtown."}
{"text":"This is a great kebab place.  The guy working was fast and friendly. My kebab came well wrapped so it didn't explode in my hands as I walked up Yonge. The restaurant was clean and has a good selection of drinks and menu options."}
{"text":"nice family runs the place and this adds to my bias! Food is OK, i use the term OK vs. Good as in my view there is a difference. If you need a quick fix this place does the trick, small clean space and great service."}
{"text":"I come here a lot and have been coming here for years.  Every time I get the chicken shawarma plate with rice and potatoes.     I don't eat a lot of spicy foods but I always ask for hot sauce on the side.  The hot sauce tastes AMAZING mixed with the garlic sauce and rice.  The service is friendly but the place is small and seating is tight so it's more suitable for take out."}
{"text":"Get take out when you go here. Dine in portions are smaller. Service is so-so. For the price they should include a bit more meat. With lots to choose from in the area they need to step up their game. There is potential just a matter of willingness."}
{"text":"Can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet.  My favourite shawarma joint.  I get their dinner plates because I'm not that big of a fan of their wraps.  Chicken and beef mix plate is my favourite.  And their home made hot sauce is the most delicious hot sauce I have ever had.  Addicting!!  Portion sizes are big and the owners are really friendly."}
{"text":"Been coming here for over 10 years and the food quality has always stayed consistent! You have to try the chicken rice plate with garlic and hot sauce. The family running this place is also very friendly."}
{"text":"This is a family owned restaurant, very kind people. The restaurant appearance may turn one away but their great food is the reason why they are open in such a busy area.  Yesterday I had their shawarma sandwich which was mix of chicken and beef and it was unbelievable. The Pita is fresh and heated perfectly, the vegetable toppings are very fresh which complements the sandwich. The hot and garlic sauces definitely make a great difference. The meat is cooked very well and is tender, unlike other shawarma restaurants where your meat may be stale , overcooked, or chewy. The sandwich is the perfect shawarma sandwich. I've been to many restaurants that offer shawarma on their menu but they don't compete. I also tried the salad and their rice on the side, their sides definitely complement their sandwiches or shawarma dinners.   You'll pay a decent 5-7 dollars but it's worth it and I've been back to eat their numerous times since I discovered this place a couple years ago and I highly recommend anyone to give this place a visit and to try their shawarma on a pita."}
{"text":"The spicy source is good and the veal is a little hard. First time tried this restaurant, not bad. Btw, it is cash only"}
{"text":"Best donair food in Toronto!!!! Easy 5 stars, one of the best I've tried really:)) homemade sauces, Turkish amazingness!!"}
{"text":"I come here probably at least once a week.  Is this THE best shawarma in the city... I don't know, maybe? Maybe not? But I have yet to find one better in the city.  And trust me, I eat a lot of shawarma.  What makes Donair different is really in the sauces.  The garlic sauce and the hot sauce are definitely unique to Donair.  They make it in house everyday and this I can say for a fact is probably the BEST in the city.  I prefer the chicken over the veal and I prefer it when it's freshly shaved off the rotisserie after it's been broiled.  Been coming here since my early days in university, now a grown man, I still keep coming back.  My go to recommendation, if you like rice go for the best bang for your buck.. Chicken and Rice for $7.50 tax in.  Double garlic sauce and hot sauce, it's pretty awesome stuff.  It'll definitely fill ya.  If you want protein up? Double chicken for $10 tax in."}
{"text":"The one thing that stands out about this place - you can feel that the owners take a lot of pride in feeding their customers.  And I gotta say, - the sauce they have is so delicious.  I walked in with no expectations for the first time, did a take out, sat in the park and ate, and found the food so good that I returned, literally 45 minutes later and packed 2 more of their dishes to carry for my travel the next day.  100 stars for all your kindness in the way you serve your customers!"}
{"text":"Doner Kebab House is a small shop in downtown Toronto run by the kindest people. Even after serving countless people daily, they still make you feel like the only customer with the sole goal of making your day. They are delightful!  The food itself is good too! I ordered the straight up donor kebab and it was delicious and full of flavor. We got the baklava for dessert and it was large and moist (there's nothing worse than a dry baklava).  If you love Turkish food, go here!"}
