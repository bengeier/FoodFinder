{"text":"My experience  is only based on resturant. Yesterday stoped in for lunch horrible horrible horrible. Payed $20.00 dollars what a waste. 
Food quality zero stars. Rice dry, chicken no flaver, rotten tomatoes. Pita bread was cold out of refrigerator. 

Avoid the resturant period!!!!!"}
{"text":"They have a variety of middle eastern foods. I found many items were overpriced! A can of tuna for $4.XX! 1 Pomegranate $3.XX. Not worth it. I'll stick to princess market & deli  (broadway and price) in mesa."}
{"text":"Not an enjoyable shopping experience. Will never go back. The store did not smell clean. The cashier was slow, did not smile, did not say \"Thank you\". Very limited products for sale. Area with bread had a couple loaves on the shelf. WOW."}
{"text":"We are so lucky to have this new Middle Eastern market right in our neighborhood. The selection of meats, lamb, goat, beef and chicken is all grass fed, hand selected and free of antibiotics. The men who oversee the meat section are all extremely helpful and friendly, particularly Ali. The cheese and olive selection is amazing. The selection of fresh produce is excellent. Their prices are as good as it gets. There is also a wonderful restaurant within the market is you don't feel like cooking. Do yourself a favor and stop by this market to try a few things. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I bought a goat meat today and felt very bad that why these peoples are doing like this!!!! If they want money, they can do some other business and can earn more money. Why they choosing food industry??? Think that somany kids, childrens and older peoples are all eating your meat and food. Okay, lemme come to point. As I said, today I bought a goat meat for a 2lbs, and came to home and opened the pack to cook, and found many of the pieces are f**king very very old meat's. It was smells like shit and completely!!! All the pieces covered with thin plastic papers and seems like kept somewhere for long time, and it's look so darken (black colored). Guys please be safe and think about your children's and your dependents!!!

I am gonna forward a brief complaint letter along with photos to Arizona helth & safety department soon. 

By this time please take care of yourself Guy's from this guys"}
{"text":"Great place for ethnic grocery shopping, halal meat and fresh pita breads. Not all fruits and veggies are fresh though, but reasonably priced. The restaurant and deli is great for grabbing a quick bite, my kids love the meat pie here."}
{"text":"This family owned establishment is one of the best supermarkets I've ever shopped in. They have a large selection of meats, produce, middle eastern and Indian foods, dairy, fresh breads and desserts! Their customer service is top notch! They have everything you need! I'm glad that they have multiple locations so there is always a Baiz near me."}
{"text":"They have the greatest selection of meats... Great Lamb shanks, marinated chicken for Shawerma, excellent pastries and baklava, a full
Selection of hot entrees and appetizers and salads. Tabbouleh, hummus... They make their own pita, and Tandoori breads fresh daily. Love their olive and cheese counter, and there endless spices. Neat, tidy, well organized and the best part?!? Really tremendous people/mngr./owners... The butchers are extremely knowledgeable and friendly..... If you're not sure, just ask they are happy to explain. Last time I purchased lamb shanks, I wasn't sure they would fit in my Dutch oven, they gladly and quickly split them and I was on my way... All of their homemade items are the best... Most delicious hummus, grape leaves and baklava EVER!! Swing by, shop, have a nosh or take it for later, u won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"If your looking for middle eastern items and produce/vegetables Ect this is the place to go.  They have bakery, deli, butcher and everything else you can think of that a grocery store would have.  The staff is very friendly and the store is very clean and organized.  They have a bakery that serves hot and cold and it's all very good and the price is very good.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great location for all middle eastern food needs. Bakery. Good prices. Large and clean. Even had small area to eat after you purchase."}
{"text":"Worse customer service that I have seen in ages. I downloaded the sales circular and went on to get a few things. When I rung up one thing did not ring on sale. When I pointed it out they accused me of having the wrong flyer. When their flyers were brought in they hid them. Those showed that I had the correct flyer. Then manager told the clerk that she would over ride the price. When I asked her to do it she gave me some poor story of why she couldn't.  They had me waiting as another girl went to a back office. The motto in this store is the customer is always wrong, even when they are right. STAY AWAY!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Restaurant has very authentic and tasty food at reasonable price.  Very friendly and helpful staff. My favorite grocery and restaurant in the Tempe/Mesa area for fresh food."}
{"text":"First visit , business trip from California.
Had lunch shish kabob , chicken was very plain ( missing herbs) everything else was good . 
Super market had great choices , fresh produce and authentic middle eastern vegetables.
Bakery was outstanding ."}
{"text":"I was craving fresh delicious food, so I only stopped at the deli. The servers were very friendly and helpful with telling me what option best fit what I was looking for. The food was served fairly quickly, piping hot and delicious!!  
There was plenty to eat and have leftovers!

I'll be back when I'm in the area for more. YUMMY!!"}
{"text":"As an immigrant from the UK this store specializes in curries, spices and middle eastern food that I grew up eating! Their shawarma is to die for. Baklava is always excellent also!"}
{"text":"Pretty good shawarma plates and sandwiches. And the store is huge and less crowded than the phoenix location!"}
{"text":"This is my go to Middle Eastern store. They have a supermarket section, a deli, a butcher for halal meat, a cafeteria/restaurant, vegetable section, nuts and sweets, and finally bread. 

I used to be a regular shopper at the old location in Phoenix but I now use the Mesa location because it's much more spacious and has a bigger selection. 

I have tried their food at Al Hana and my favorite order is the beef shawarma which tastes like the shawarma in the ME. 

Their vegetable selection is also pretty good and priced really well. If I lived close by, I would definitely buy all my veggies from Baiz. 

My only \"recent\" concern is the freshness of their meat. I have noticed a few times recently that their meat was not as fresh as it used to be. I have gone in different times and different days but on all those different occasions, it was a pretty similar experience. Not sure if they're not having enough customers to have more of a turnover but I hope they will realize this soon because it is starting to make me rethink buying the meat from there. 

Other than that, the location is clean and their service is always very good and the food at Al Hana always tastes great. The veggies and the fresh bread keep me coming back all the time."}
{"text":"The market is new fresh and clean with all the great products stock by the original store. Great location in the valley."}
{"text":"This place is great, tons of variety of American and middle eastern products. The meat at the butchery is super fresh and all Halal. 

We went primarily for the food at the cafe. I had the beef shawarma which was delicious and tender. The rice had a great flavor. On the authenticity scale of 1-10, my friend from Iraq said it was about an 8. 

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Holy cow, they really expanded!! Same great meats and products as their PHX location but you no longer feel claustrophobic!  It looks like they must have taken over a decent-sized grocery store.  It's about as big as your standard Basha's/Fry's.  I also think their produce is better than the PHX location.  We always get our lamb here.  Everything is halal and it's so much more affordable than going to AJ's!"}
{"text":"I like shopping there they have everything from Middle East food the meat, vegetables and bread always fresh."}
{"text":"Hit or miss experience at the restaurant. It's close and seems fresh so we've been numerous times. Inconsistent quality usually. Bakery and baklava great!
But tonight, I ordered dinner for my family. When I went to pick it up, they asked what I ordered. I told them, they read the ticket, they counted, I paid, I left. I got home and my kids' food wasn't in there. I called. They told me to COME BACK TOMORROW!! For my kids' dinner! Nothing else they would do, just try to hang up on me so they could close. I paid for it but had to finish making dinner myself anyways. 
Like I said, normally a decent experience. What gets me is the dishonesty. TWO girls checked the boxes and the order before I left. I called as soon as I got home and the response was to come back tomorrow for my refund or my food. That's shameful. Not acceptable from ANY restaurant, much less from one that seemingly exudes religious observance."}
{"text":"Great store, love their meat selection. Lots of different middle eastern and Mediterranean selections."}
{"text":"Great market, everything middle eastern available, restaurant fantastic, and prices competitive!"}
{"text":"Attended the Grand Opening today! To think this was a former Basha's... They provided free water, samples of baklava and pies filled with cheese or spinach, and samples cracker bread with hummus. They even handed out free tea and biscuits. Their hummus was amazing and all of the other sample foods tasted good. They have a great selection on yogurt, but a limited selection on produce. The cashier lady that checked us out was friendly. It looks like they have some unused space their going to expand into. Seating for the restaurant is fairly limited on the bottom floor, however there's more upstairs. My only suggestion would be for the prices to be more flexible. I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"This is my go to for halal meat. They also offer  middle eastern and southasian groceries."}
{"text":"Did a search for goat meat and this place came up. I like it! First time in a Halal based grocerie store. I love seeing new and exciting (for me), foods!
The butcher section was pretty good. The sheep head and Lamb tongue had been sitting out for a while. Most cuts looked a little dry. The ground meats looked better.
I went ahead and got a head, tongue and shank. Gonna play with my food and see what I come up with."}
{"text":"I normally don't partake of Middle Eastern cuisine, but Baiz has changed my mind.  The groceries are fair-priced, and their restaurant cannot be beaten.  Huge, delicious, made-from-scratch portions that will keep you full for hours while only lightly taxing the wallet.  We're hooked and will keep returning for more delicious goodies!"}
{"text":"At first this place seems overwhelming but then you realize it's the best. Everything is clean the people are nice and willing to let you sample.  We ordered from the restaurant and tried a little bit of everything.  The staff was so welcoming and even though there is a slight wait to get your order it's fresh. Everything is home made and tastes like it the garlic sauce is a garlic lovers dream I put it on everything"}
{"text":"Always the best! And the chicken shawarma is my favorite! Great customer service! I love the environment and the people it's my neighborhood one stop shop! Feels like family!"}
{"text":"Great store! You walk in and it's like a supermarket. Very reasonably priced (minus the green tomatoes). The produce is fresh, but sometimes missing essentials like sabzi (mint, green flag leaves, etc). Has a great selection of boxed pastries (although not as fresh as you'd hope) and bread (although no Barbari or sangak). The meat market is the real attraction (lamb chops, etc). Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great location, very clean! The staff is amazingly friendly and prices are reasonable! Products from all over too!!! Produce is good quality"}
{"text":"Excellent store for specific things.

Meat and fowl have always been excellent in my experience. They do not do any kind of fresh fish

Produce tends to vary according to the taste of most of their customers.  Specific things are great. Other stuff . . . well, it's not their specialty. 

They have stuff like raw olives in season which prompted me to buy five or six pounds to cure. So be open to surprises.

They also have great comb honey, killer Armenian fruit preserves, fabulous Indian yogurt, a great selection of nuts, cured olives, enough basmati rice to make your head spin, and I haven't even tried the pastries. 

I find 99% of the people that work here to be very polite, in a restrained and/or formal manner. If you expect someone to yell \"Hi\" or \"Welcome to Baiz\" or \"Have a nice day!\" from 25 feet away you might not like this place."}
{"text":"What a great little supermarket! It's a mix of Mediterranean and Hispanic goods here, with fresh, prepackaged, and frozen goods. They make fresh pita bread and have their own machines in the store to make them conveyor belt style. There are also some unique items here you won't find in other grocery stores such as green almonds and yogurt soda. In addition, freshly baked sweets and prepared foods can be found in cases near the entrance. The butcher area has freshly trimmed meat, and the red meat they sell (Beef, lamb, goat) is grass fed, hand butchered, and halal for those with religious dietary restrictions.

I browsed here at their grand opening and loved looking at all the unique goods they had in stock. We ended up taking home some lavash, pita, and some honeycomb. The pita was a great deal ($.99 for 4 large freshly made pieces). 

Check out was fast and friendly. I'll be back if I need more supplies if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I used to go the Phoenix place very often. The new place is much closer to me and much better! 

The new selection is more inclusive, it's basically a supermarket which has all the authentic items that are hard to find elsewhere plus regular items that can be found in other stores. And it's cleaner/newer too!

I usually buy some cold food from the restaurant, and my only complaint is the long time I have to wait to get two pies from the fridge.  But to be fair, I believe the restaurant is not actually part of the market (it has a different name). So it might be a good idea to have separate Yelp pages!"}
{"text":"The best international market I've ever been too. Full American style deli, yummy fresh knafeh at a reasonable price, interesting middle eastern Knick knacks and decor (great for gifts), loved the tea selection"}
{"text":"Came in for dates, got dates. Little restaurant has good prices for the food but was a little confused as to what everything was. Very average experience, would come back."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! This could be your go-to grocery store. Fresh halal meats, fresh pitas, a restaurant inside! What else do you want?

Update: The shawarma here is one of the best I've had in a while, hands down."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out after seeing it on Yelp. Purchased some fresh whole wheat pita which was very good. Bought some lunch from the deli. Lunch was not so exciting. There was not a lot of lamb in my sandwich and the dolmas were nothing special. Not overly impressed by this market in general thought it would be bigger and more variety of Mediterranean goodies. I will definitely return for more pita though!"}
{"text":"Thrilled to find a Baiz grocery closer to my neighborhood. I have made the trek to the Phoenix location and found it to be a great adventure in shopping. However, I now much prefer the new Mesa location because I find it to be better organized, well-lit, and cleaner in appearance. I was told by the cashier that this used to be another grocery store, like a Basha's or an Albertson's, but I forget which. The store is well-laid out with nice wide aisles.

I checked out every aisle and deli case upon my first visit. The offerings of scratch-made flatbreads, hummus, and pastry are quite impressive. The butcher counter offers fresh ground lamb, which I will return for, since it looks so much more appealing than the shriink-wrapped offerings you find in other grocery stores' meat sections. The real adventure for me is trying new items you won't find anywhere else. For example, at least a dozen different flavors or \"recipes\" for canned fava beans. I also like the fresh produce section, although it's a little bit small. The cookie and dessert section is a blast... the number of exotic offerings are hard to resist.

Great little market for all of your Middle Eastern shopping needs."}
{"text":"This is the best place to buy meat if you care where your animal products are coming from. All beef is grass fed and kosher. Which means no factory farming or mass slaughtering!!! The customer service is always awesome and the prices can't be beat!!! I love the fresh pita too."}
{"text":"Really like this place!! The butchers are really nice, it has a lot of middle eastern items, very clean and organized. I'll definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"I recently went to this location of Baiz in Mesa AZ.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I am a regular customer at the Baiz located off Roosevelt Road & 20th Street in Phoenix, but this is the first time I went to the one in Mesa.

I went a few days ago to the Mesa location, and purchased two sandwiches from the restaurant.  I ordered the shish tawook sandwich, and the lamb kabab sandwich.  Both were pretty good.  My wife, who loves the original Baiz in Phoenix, could not tell the difference in the shish tawook sandwich.  I found what I ordered for lamb kabab to be similar to what is available in Phoenix.  

About the only things that could be done differently are:

1) Figure out how to be more efficient.  It does take considerably longer for orders to be processed in Mesa AZ

2) Consider getting the capability to announce the orders from the restaurant area by microphone as some people could not hear when their orders are ready.  

This market is in a bit of a competitive location.  All of Dobson Road, and the environs is becoming a whole strip of ethnic markets (Asian and Middle Eastern).  You need to learn to compete.  You are not the only one, like the case in Phoenix.  You need be on your best game here.  You need a good presentation, but you need to deliver on quality.  Figure out how to continuously deliver what you promise.  Sell the experience.  You need market distinction.  I do not want this be a failed venture, particularly in an area that needs new development.  It is more difficult in suburbia, where strip malls are a dime a dozen.  

As far as the branding of the restaurant, I think that you may want to call the name something different then Al-Hana.  Let Al-Hana be at the Phoenix location.  Call it something like Al-Hana II, or something to distinguish it differently...perhaps the same for Baiz (call it Baiz II).  

Additionally, while the clientele in Mesa and East Valley may be less Middle Eastern, try to figure out what is a happy medium to attract those of different background, but still showcase Middle Eastern.  Do not fall into the \"Wal-Mart trap\" and \"sanitize\" the brand for suburbia.  Keep it authentic.  Just spruce up the image a bit.  

Also, market yourself to the local medical offices and businesses.  Many medical professionals and office staff will queue up for lunch or dinner when they see a good thing.  There are so many medical offices and related within a five minutes drive of the location.  

I want this place to have more business.  I want this place successful.

FYI:  My father is a real fan of baklawa and mamouls. He likes them at this location, and keeps reminding me that it is both good and bad that they are not in Illinois (where he lives)!!  If Baiz was there, he would be packing on the pounds with the mamouls and related!!!!"}
{"text":"We tried this location thinking it would be better than their other location but it was much much worst. The quality of their meat is beyond horrible. They really deserve to be shut down if they continue to sell their customers meat, that is guaranteed to make their customers sick. I made the same mistake of buying $200 worth of meat from this location and again ended up throwing all of it away. Their meat is not edible, you will throw up if you take a bite of it. Lamb, and ground beef have a disgusting smell and their color isn't right. You will actually throw up trying to cook their meat from the horrible odor of meat. They lost me as a customer, I don't trust consuming any product from their store."}
{"text":"Great market w a variety of product. Best meat selection in town. The new location is conveniently located in East valley and the have a great little area to order and eat food. The vegetable section is also hard to beat not to mention the fresh bread made."}
