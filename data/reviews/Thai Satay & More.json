{"text":"This is a great Thai place, right across from the GO station. It is small and you will likely be the first person/people to sit down but don't fear, others will soon follow. 

I should warn, it is expensive."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and very authentic Thai.  The service was friendly and fast. We had a great time. Thanks Yelp for the great reviews that got us here."}
{"text":"This place has been around for a while; the first time I'd gone was more than 10 years ago.  

Lunch buffet is popular with nearby office workers.  Not a big selection, but the food is always fresh and of good quality.  Taste wise....spice level toned down to suit Canadian palate.  

Nice decor, very clean, and warm service.  The opposite of hole-in-the-wall-but-food taste really authentic type of restaurant."}
{"text":"Great Buffet Selection : Lunch and Dinner.  The a la carte menu is superb with portions.  On top of everything Service here is Extremely Friendly.  The location is really fantastic as you've got plenty of parking and my favorite grocery store Whole Foods around the corner.  One of my top places for Thai. 
Lunch Buffet: 12:00 - 2:00 PM
Dinner Buffet: 5:00 - 10:00 PM ... I believe the buffet for lunch and dinner is $12"}
