{"text":"This is what I call clean pizza.  It's not greasy and is fairly light.  My go to here is a white pizza with mushrooms and sausage(I add crushed red at home).  The mushrooms are fresh and not canned.  It's an outstanding pizza.  The salad dressing is right on too.  I've never had an unpleasant experience with any of the staff and I've been going there for years."}
{"text":"Total hole in the wall blink and you'll miss it but solid pizza for the price.  It's half what a pie costs here in California.  Has a nice little patio next door for Al Fresco dining."}
{"text":"I have only had the white with artichokes (and once with the kalamata olives) but it is delicious. No nonsense service, can order online which is always nice."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza in Cleveland, maybe not the cheapest but well worth the price"}
{"text":"valentine's has some of the better pizza in cleveland. the white pizza is good if you're into that.

the sandwiches, for the most part are good as well, but i prefer the 'dinners', big meals for a good price.

their delivery kinda pisses me off, it's essentially only for corporate business, something like a flat $8 charge."}
{"text":"This is the best place in Cleveland Heights for takeout pizza. It is very consistent and the staff are very friendly."}
{"text":"It almost gets five stars for their pepperoni and mushroom pizza. Definitely in the top five pizzas I've ever had. 

Many other pizzas are great, too. Try their white pizza with artichoke hearts for something rather unique. 

Many people like their meatball subs. I'm not a big fan of their other subs or entrees."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in Cleveland.  Thin crust pizza with great toppings.  The olives are whole kalamata olives and are delicious if that's your thing.  The white artichoke pizza is also tasty.  The italian dinners are also supposed to be good."}
{"text":"No delivery available at 4:30pm on a Thursday. Filled out the entire website for an order just to get called back that there is no delivery service?? Ill call ahead next time to smaller pizza places. Thanks for the effort guys.  ."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite pizza spots in little italy. My friend used to live down the street and introduced me to this take out only spot. Before discovery I was hooked on mama Santos but after trying this I was sold. Pie comes out a bit less brown than mama santos.
Go there for a basic pizza pie with no frill.  Fresh ingredients and friendly service."}
{"text":"Valentinos is a Little Italy staple for over 25 years !! And we've been going there for that whole time. 

Get a pie with red onions or a white pie with artichokes. These are classics and taste awesome.  Great sauce .

Hard to categorize the pizza - not quite NY style (crust is a little crispy for that) and definitely not Midwest style.  Either way though - it tastes really good. 

Primarily a take-out joint."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Valentino's in a while, but need to go again!  Best pizza in Little Italy by far.  If you read below you will see my comments on Dirty Santas.  It is at the top of Murray Hill so don't be confused if you don't see it on the main drag.  It is more of a carryout place, but I think during the summer they may have a patio on the outside.  
Best pizza?  No way, but best in the area by far.  Hit it up."}
{"text":"It was a late night, when we were looking for something still open other than fast food. We were able to order two large pizzas with toppings for under $25 and under 20 minutes. 

The pizza was good with a nice crispy crust and wasn't soggy at all. There isn't anything particularly special about the pizza, but we would order from them again if we were to return to CLE. 

A much better alternative to pizza chains."}
{"text":"This is a great pizza carry-out.  They also have delicious pasta, salads, and sandwiches.  They have tables outside, which works only sometimes in Cleveland.  It is located in Little Italy, near Case Western Reserve and University Hospitals."}
{"text":"Having gone to CWRU for school, I've had the opportunity to taste many of the different pizza joints around university circle.  For overall experience, Valentino's cannot be beat.  It is a local place that has been around for decades and offers delicious pizzas, sandwiches, and dinners.  My personal favorites include white pizza with artichoke and mushrooms, the rigatoni parmesan dinner, and the meatball subs.  

If you are in University Circle and are looking for great pizza, Valentino's is the best choice."}
{"text":"Delicious, hot pepperoni pizza by the slice hit the spot today! Perfect crust. Service with a smile. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Stopped in and ordered a 14\" sausage pizza. Pizza was ready in 15 minutes. It was a decent thin crust pizza cut into triangles.  We ate at their side patio. They do have a limited beer and wine selection to choose from but alcohol is prohibited on their patio. Parking is extremely hard to come by in this Italian neighborhood."}
{"text":"Three stars for one reason: 
I don't like their plain pepperoni pizza. I feel like they are better at the unique specialty pizzas than they are at regular pizzas.  This is ok, but if I crave pizza, I find myself wanting greasy cheese and pepperoni.

On the other hand, their unique pizzas are fabulous.  One that I get often and absolutely love has eggplant and onion on it.  The onions are subtle, but crucial to the pie and the eggplant is perfect.  The cheese holds the two simple ingredients together and it's a fantastic melody of flavors."}
{"text":"This still remains my favorite pizza place on the east side and arguably the best in CLE. Usually get the deluxe pizza and I am never disappointed. This is a no frills kinda place, but also gets my pizza right every time and it is always hot. You won't be disappointed if you are looking at picking up some pie on the way home for dinner."}
{"text":"Valentino's pizza is one of those hidden gems. This place has one of the best pizza cooked in Italian style. The location is great and outdoor seating is not bad either. I will be regular here."}
{"text":"I only experienced Valentino's a handful of times, but I was never disappointed. Working summers at CWRU made for some great lunch breaks and after work dinners here. I loved nothing more than to sip an Aranciata while chowing down on a meatball pizza (which is not on the menu but they will make it for you if you ask). Every pizza I tried was fresh, flavorful, and made-to-order.

Delicious, and always hits the spot after a drink or two at Lounge Leo down the street."}
{"text":"Carry out only....  Clean shop, always with nice people working there.  It's a decent light pizza with fresh toppings.  Fairly priced. It's not the best pizza in town but it's goooood! my favorite topping here is pepperoni"}
{"text":"Patio area is nice, little bird poopy but not bad. Pizza is very nice. Very fresh and tasty. Definetly reccomend"}
{"text":"Good pizza, the best in Little Italy. It doesn't matter if it's close to NY style pizza or not. It's still pretty good. The thin crust is great, and I love the variety of toppings they have.
Walking distance from class made it even better.

The last few times I've been, I've actually gotten their dinners. My favorite is the eggplant parmesan. It comes with pasta, bread, butter, salad and dressing, all for about $9. That's a great deal for a college student. Their eggplant parm is good, and their red sauce is flavorful. The only downfall is that it gets on the greasy side, sometimes with a pool of oil on the bottom of the container.

The place is really small, so just expect to either pick it up or have it delivered. I don't know if they have tables outside in the summer, but they might."}
{"text":"A friend grabbed a pizza from Valentino's for me as she was passing by. I didn't get to eat it until the following day, but it was delicious, even when reheated in the microwave. The next time I'm in town I intend to drop by and order the same pizza, but this time I'll try it straight from the oven. I'm looking forward to it!"}
{"text":"I'm from brooklyn, not brooklyn, ohio, the real brooklyn so finding a good slice of pizza in Cleveland is difficult. Although valentinos is still not close to Bk, whenever I;m in the mood for a slice I go there. They also have excellent meatball heros for a reasonable price. Very friendly workers to always up for a convo."}
{"text":"If you're used to New York style pizza, this is edible. However it's nothing special. The crust and sauce are very bland, and the sausage so sparse I couldn't even taste it. My pizza was also undercooked, with no browning of the cheese and no charring or browning of the crust. Frankly, it looked like a microwave pizza. As a west sider, I'll probably never be back. Oh well... the search continues for a quality pizzeria in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Im sure they have great pizza.  It looked and smelled great.  Alas i will never know.   After waiting for 10 mins to even be acknowledged my pleasant yet servertorially challenged counter person informed me only pizza.  No sandwiches pasta etc.   lost opportunity for a Monday night.  He spent more time wiping the front of the oven down than being concerned with taking an order.   Booooio!"}
{"text":"I am from the Chicagoland area, I always try the pizza wherever I go and this place did not let me down. I did not have cash when I ordered online, they were able to put the tip on the bill for me. I got a large sausage and pepper pizza. Delicious! I also ordered pop and a chicken sandwich. I thought delivery time was fine, no issues and the gentleman kindly welcomed me to the city. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Cleveland is a pizza town, yet finding good pizza is a daunting task.  After living in the Cleveland area for 8-ish years, I've been around the pizza block, so to say.  Valentino's easily makes my list of top 5 pizza joints in and around Cleveland.  

The pizza itself is consistently delicious.  Always fresh, and always awesome.  They DO put sugar in their sauce, which is weird because it doesn't taste overly sweet to me.  It must be just the right amount to make their sauce addictive!

The service is always great, with everyone being super nice both in person and over the phone.

There's no indoor dining area, but there IS a lovely patio available when the weather warms up.

Also, Valentino's is many, many times better than Mama Santa's.  I'll drive from Lakewood just to get a Valentino's pizza, but wouldn't walk down the hill to get a pizza from Mama Santa's."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from here on a Friday night when it was snowing terribly and I didn't want to go outside.

Let me say first that the service was prompt despite the snow, and my pizza got to me still hot. I don't live too far from the store, but that means a lot.

The pizza itself, unfortunately, was a little bit underwhelming. The crust wasn't crispy, which is my number one requirement for a good pizza. The pizza overall was greasy and somewhat unsatisfying. The vegetables on the pizza were exactly what I ordered, but I also think that the sauce to dough ratio was off, probably just an effect of having poor dough to begin with.

Valentino's is unlikely to be my go-to pizza location in the future, but it's certainly not a bad place to order pizza from."}
{"text":"My favourite pizza parlor in Little Italy! You guys are simply awesome!"}
{"text":"Never coming here again. I live on the block, 30 seconds away from Valentino's. So, of course, I had to try out the closest pizza joint near me. Since it's 2015, I like to order pizza online, and this one was for pick-up. The website could use a huge makeover with it's amateur-like interface. After figuring out how to make my order, I received an email notice saying my pizza will be ready in....wait for iiiiitt, 45 minutes. 45 minutes!!!! Okay, whatever, I figured if it takes them that long then it better be baked to perfection. I go to the shop 42 min later, pick up my pizza within 5 min, and go back home. I open the box, ready to be amazed by all the ravings I've heard from others including \"authentic Italian pizza\", \"high quality\", \"amazing local pizzeria\". Pshhhhhhtt, are you kidding me?!?! Were you guys born on another planet? This was perhaps the worst cheese pizza I've had in my lifetime. The pie barely had any cheese, it was horribly cut (I had to grab a knife to fully cut it), and the base of the pizza was ~cardboard dry/burny, with about a ~5mm thickness. Because I pride myself on being unbiased, I continued to eat the pizza, but mostly because I was starving. It tasted like I just bought pizza from a backroom pizzeria that sells dollar slices, except burnt. Waste of my time, and a bad way to end the day for my stomach. Have fun ordering, you guys!

P.S. I always like to give second chances, so maybe when I'm having a day where I feel super nice I'll stop by for a slice and update this review."}
{"text":"Not great but not bad. I got veggie pizza that had a lot of kalamata olives which I like but it was just a little too much for my taste.  Two stars because the \"Meh. I've experienced better\" sums up my experience. I was also hoping to eat in at the restaurant and there is no in dining option, take out only."}
{"text":"Pretty good pie.

As far as Little Italy goes, this is the best pizza joint. It's pretty decent and consistent. Thin crust, not too much sauce and great toppings. The white pizza with artichokes is great. I get mine with kalamata olives. YUM

They also sell by the slice. Nice for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Unique. Great ingredients. Delicious

I've been here more times than I would like to admit.
Valentino's is a cute little hole in the wall, family run pizzeria that serves up a unique and strangely addicting pizza. I really like that you can see a fresh pizza being rolled out everytime you go

I grew up on 'brooklyn style' pizza, and have eaten various styles of pizza from all over the globe, including authentic pizza from Italy.

There is no such thing as a 'correct' way of making pizza, nor is there such a things as the 'best' pizza. What it comes down to is personal preference (which is true for all food), and Valentino's is a winner in my mind. Here's why!

Crust: It is a no-nonsense crust, no garlic or cheese (like they do in fast food chains), and they don't even roll up the edges! (which I really like). Never dry, their crust provides just the right amount of chewiness.

Cheese: Fresh. I know this not only from eating their pizza, but also from getting the Valentino's salad (which I also love). They put the same mozzarella that goes on pizza on their salad. Cheese is pretty straight forward, you either use fresh, quality ingredient, or you don't. Valentino's does.

Sauce: This element of Valentino's pizza is perhaps my favorite, and yet it is also the most difficult to describe. Something about their red sauce just makes their pizza different. It has a more tomato-y taste to it. Sweeter? More tart? Difficult to describe. It is like normal steak vs dry-aged steak, where the a latter has a tad more intense flavor. 

Valentino's takes all these elements, and produces a very well balanced pizza that they should be very proud of.

Tip: This may sound odd, but I like to get plain cheese slices that have already been made, cooled down, but then reheated to order in the back. Reason: when their pizza first comes out of their oven, it is hot, REALLY hot. So hot that I have burnt the top of my mouth several times attempting to eat it. But if you let it cool down, the crust won't be as good. Ask for an individual slice from the back to be reheated. Just the right temp to eat.

Additional note: Their artichoke and olives white pizza is delicious as well (a little on the heavy side though). And their tiramisu is also highly recommended! (rich, and not too sweet). They have a little patio on the side where you can eat after you order.


Crust: 4/5
Cheese: 4/5
Sauce: 5/5"}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza in Cleveland. This was our treat when we lived in Little Italy, but even as out-of-town visitors, we make a stop at Valentinos, every time we visit family and friends in Cleveland. I miss you Pizza Bianca ;-)"}
{"text":"When I lived in University Circle back in 2005 - 2007 my roommates and I spent more money at Valentino's than we should probably admit; but we did it because the pizza is awesome and the service was above and beyond. Hands down, this is my favorite pizza in Cleveland.

Unfortunately, like many businesses in the food service industry, turnover at Valentino's tends to be high, and almost none of the people who made my Valentino's experience so great are still there. That's not to say the quality has deteriorated, as each time I've been back since the pizza and service have lived up to the standards I always knew. I just hope that never changes."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I've found in cleveland, definitely the best in little Italy. Pizzas are reasonably priced and absolutely delicious. They also have really good subs. Meatball is great on both subs and pizza. I honestly don't know how mama Santa's could possibly seem better. Cheaper maybe, but they taste like Pizza Hut, just another pizza. They have a patio for outdoor dining weather permitting, but its pizza just take it home."}
{"text":"Ordered a large extra cheese half sausage half pepperoni tonight for pickup.  Got there before it was ready n waited a few to get pizza and take home which is a 5 minute drive. Pizza was edible at best....little undercooked, not quite enough cheese and way to much sauce! Sauce squirting out of every bite, half the pizza was thin crusted and ok and the other half was thick crusted, undercooked and gross. We've had their pizza before and it was ok, this time not good and we'll probably not be back"}
{"text":"Great pizza and salad, Outdoor seating. No bathrooms! uh oh!"}
{"text":"$8.00 delivery fee on a $12.00 pizza?!?  I was ordering online - when I saw this, I cancelled my order - am 100% certain I did not confirm it.  Imagine my surprise when 20 mins later, I received a confirmation email that my pizza was on its way.  When I called back to cancel the order, I was told by Ms. Snippy Smartypants, who repeatedly placed me on hold, that I didn't have an order.   After more hold time, I was told that if my order came in, they would cancel.  I checked my bank statement, had charges pending.  Called back with my confirmation number - Ms. S. put me on with a managerial toned guy who told me quite nastily 1:  That there was nothing he could do, cancelled pizza was already on it's way.  Then, changed to 2:  Pizza would be cancelled, but I would pay a \"convenience charge\" (not so convenient).  Then, upon further discussion, 3:  Order cancelled, but \"Don't ever call here again.\"  (Don't worry...). Shortly thereafter, nice Valentino's pizza delivery guy shows up in my driveway, stating he for a weird message to leave, and did I still want the pizza - I explained what happened, he refused my tip, left, and called back shortly to verify that he confirmed the order was cancelled, minus a $1.75 \"transaction fee., sending apologies for terrible transaction.  Thanks, sweet pizza delivery guy - hope someday soon you find more professional, upstanding employers.  Pizza Valentino, we will never speak again, you A-hole you..."}
{"text":"my favorite thin crust pizza in the city. i recommend the artichoke pizza white + tomato's. it's not cheap, but hands down beats mama santos down the street."}
{"text":"Valentino's is my favorite pizza place in Little Italy.  They use quality ingredients; the cheese and tomatoes are fresh and taste great.  The owner is very nice too, one of the times I went there he gave me a free slice of pizza while I was waiting for my pizza.  The subs there are also good, and a good value too.  Their large subs are good enough for two meals and are under $8.  All in all, good service, and good food.  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Apparently there is a rivalry between Mama Santa's and Valentino's pizza and you will love one and hate the other. Until I heard this fact, I was wondering what I was missing with everyone telling me that Mama Santa's was the best in C-town. I just didn't get it. Then I tried Valentino's white pizza. It was good! In true Cleveland fashion, it's not fabulous or even great, but just very good, but much better than Mama's. We had white pizza with artichokes (they have a variety of white pizzas), very cheesy and garlicky, although I wish it had a bit more *something* to really make it pop. Still it was one of the better pizza's I've had here, so definitely worth a second chance."}
{"text":"I worked here one summer in college, so I can be a little bias.  They use all fresh ingredients and don't add any grease.  The food is fantastic because of the fresh delicious ingredients.  

The previous pizza maker was the best, but he moved on to pursue other dreams.  I've been back since, and it's still solid and delicious! I would call it the second best pizza in town.

Their Valentino salad w/ chicken is also amazing.  I still crave it.  They make their own salad dressing, and it's wonderful."}
{"text":"yay, me like the artichoke cheese pizza."}
{"text":"If you ever have a pizza craving & you are in the vicinity of Case Western University Campus.... Valentino's Pizza is the place with your poison.

Located in one of the quieter streets of Murray Hill, this joint doesn't have much to boast about in terms of appearances. The first time I had a pizza craving to satiate in the CLE I drove right past it. It's almost looks like a dry cleaner/ hardware store as there isn't much ongoing activity within the store. 

If you are looking for a place to sit down & enjoy your pizza this isn't the place for you. They have no seating available .....just \"Take & go\". 

The Pizza though is another story all together! It's probably one of the best I have had in its price range. A large pizza costs about  $15-17 but the flavors are spot on! I have only ever gotten the dulexe pizza which is basically veggies with pepperoni & sausage which is....mmmm so good! The ingredients are fresh & the meat is delicious!

The two times I have done take out from here the pizza has been ready to go within 20 mins.  

I'm told they charge $8 for delivery which is pretty steep even if you are wanting a sensational pizza delivered to your doorstep.

Overall: definitely worth a shot."}
{"text":"We had our pizzas burned three separate times. I wrote a letter to the owner and never heard back. After forty years of enjoying Val's we are NOT going back."}
{"text":"Is it the best pizza I've had? Not at all. 

Is it the best in Little Italy? I sure hope not for the sake of Little Italy's culinary integrity. 

That said, the pizza is good. There's nothing wrong with it at all, and the union of the ingredients make it pretty delicious. However, it doesn't compare with NY style, so I'm not sure about that parallel that several Yelpers drew (the slices aren't giant enough to warrant folding, crust isn't thin or airy enough...to name a few issues)."}
{"text":"Big disappointment. They said the crust was made in house daily but the perfect circle and cardboard taste tells me it is frozen and mass produced. Toppings ok. White garlic and artichoke passable."}

Ate them on the side instead.
Not the best pizza in the world I've ever had, but its good, def good"}

(Adding pictures)"}
{"text":"Delicious slices, full pizza, or pasta, you can find either at this place.  I was walking down Murray hill, starving and looking for something to satisfy my appetite when I realized I haven't really stopped by Valentino's pizza.  Walking in, I was hit with the smell of pasta, pizza and in general yummy stuff.  The meals are actually a pretty good deal. I got the eggplant Parmesan (without the cheese-yay Asianess and lactose intolerance), which they made mine to order, a LARGE order of pasta underneath the eggplant, salad and bun.  All for about 8 or 9 bucks.  This was definitely enough for 2 meals, which as a poor dental student my wallet appreciates.  There were no chairs to sit and wait while I was ordering, maybe the only downside.  I think during the summer they have seating, which would be awesome but at the time there weren't any tables.  For a quick bite, I would def check this place out."}
{"text":"The pizza here is just okay. It's not bad, it's...okay. I still think Mama Santa has the better pizza. Valentino's pizza is pretty inexpensive too so, that's a plus."}
{"text":"Literally unbelievable how bad their customer service is. It's apparently against their store policy to correct orders that they get wrong, or to give you what you paid for.

We ordered a pizza, were instead given one with meat (which we can't eat), and discovered this after coming back home. Usually this is simple- you call the place, they correct it, I have no problem with stuff like this and understand it happens. Not the case here. I was told that there was no way they could give us the pizza we ordered, and also no way to issue a refund. I had also asked if they could deliver our correct pizza, which they said they couldn't comp that either. I guess that was assuming in the first place that they at minimum corrected orders. I really couldn't believe it, and tried getting an answer to why they literally would not provide what we paid for, and was given a very rude run around for over ten minutes. I was told there was no manager and no authority to do this. Eventually someone claiming to be a manager came on and was so extremely rude about the whole thing right off that bat (eventually he said they'd do the best they could to make a pizza, however that they were extremely busy) that I just said we'd leave it to our credit card company to contest the charges. Literally unbelievably rude and not even up to minimum customer service expectations.

Side note- they charge you full price for half toppings. Least of my complaints, but also really annoying.

Update- called to try to resolve this with the owner, as soon as I said I was calling unfortunately about a customer service issue, was told I was going to have to hang up. Was hung up on. I guess this is their store policy, no corrections, no refunds, no apologies."}
{"text":"This was a staple when I was a student at Case. I can still taste it! Their white pizza is the one that I compare all white pizzas to. The best white pizza is with artichokes, tomatoes and garlic."}

Pizza is my boyfriend and sometimes I cheat on him with my bed."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had and I'm from new York, I eat pizza all the time. The pizza sauce is wonderful, slightly sweet. The crust thin and really good. I get the pepperoni and they put it under the cheese! Real good Italian stuff too. The flavor gets magnified so much. I love it."}
{"text":"In Cleveland's Little Italy, this is the best pizza I've had in the neighborhood. Not that that's necessarily saying much, because Mama Santa's is extremely overrated. But it is hope I suppose. 

Valentino's is a small take-out only joint. Order ahead and pick-up or grab a slice to go. The pizza is cooked in a regular gas fired stone oven. The same as most restaurants have in their kitchen. The pizza we chose was the 14\" Valentino's Deluxe. The crust was chewy, yet firm, the sauce, flavorful, the toppings well portioned and the mozzarella, adequate to hold it all together. The one thing stood out to me was the olives. Whole, luscious looking kalamata olives sitting atop this pizza, unlike the boring black mushed up slices that come from a can like most other pizza joints. Actual real, healthy looking olives! What a concept!"}
{"text":"I don't get pizza anywhere else anymore! Best pizza in town. They have good tiramisu as well. Could get really busy so best to call in and order before going."}
{"text":"Here's my conversation with the angry-looking sleep-punk behind the counter. 

\"Do you do pizza by the slice?\"

\"Yeah, let me check.\" (Goes to the back.) \"We have Sausage and Canadian Bacon and Mushroom.\"

\"Just one.\"

\"No two. Two slices.\"

\"It's just one.\"

\"What? Oh Bacon and Mushroom on the same pizza. Ok that's great.\"

\"One.\" (Briefly holds up finger.) \"Just one.\"

\"Right. Bacon AND mushroom, on the same pizza. That's the one I want.\" 

\"No, it's just one.\"

\"Yep! That one. Two slices of it.\" 

\"We just have one.\"

\"Not two separate kinds. Yeah.\"

\"No, only one slice.\"

\"No, Two slices.\"

\"No we just have one slice left.\"

\"Oh. Ok. Then I'll have sausage.\"


It was good pizza."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza from here.
It was pretty tasty! The sauce was really sweet, but good nonetheless.
There's patio seating, which is nice.
Pricing is very reasonable.
Staff are super friendly.

4 stars!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite local pizza joints.  Very light crus with tasty sauce.  Service was always fantastic and fast.

reminds me of a NY style pizza."}
{"text":"The pizza here is alright.  If I had to choose between Mama Santa and Valentino's I'd choose Valentino's.  The crust is nice and crisp, and the toppings are fresh (always like it when they use fresh mushrooms instead of canned).  It's not the best I've had, but it's not bad pizza or anything, just OK.  2 large 1 toppings will cost you around $20."}
{"text":"Valentino's is a convenient place to get some satisfying pizza, pasta, or sandwich on the go! I've tried the pizza here once, but the last couple times I've been here I've gotten the chicken parmesan sandwich. When I had gotten pizza, I ordered a small pizza with chicken as a topping, which cost about $10. I personally thought the pizza was not bad - nothing amazingly special, but satisfying for when you're craving pizza and also a pretty filling meal for the price you pay. The chicken parmesan sandwich is pretty tasty and satisfying, and I do enjoy ordering this on the go but it is not that big of a sandwich. They do also have a dinner combo with the sandwiches/pastas that includes salad and bread, which I imagine is more of a complete meal and would be more filling. 

It does take some time for them to prepare your food here, so do expect a little bit of a wait when you order here. I don't have any complaints about my experiences with the staff here though. Overall, Valentino's is definitely a convenient place to stop by for some satisfying food on the go!"}
{"text":"On 9/12/17 I called an ordered a Chicken Parmesan sandwich. When I arrived 20 minutes later it was not ready. The young girl behind the counter was not pleasant when asked how long will it take.  15 minutes later I  received my order.  When I  inspected the sandwich, the bottom of the bun was soggy with sauce,  The chicken was not hot and sauce, was all over the bun and the chicken breast was hanging out  of the bun.   They must be under new management.  This was the worst food and service I ever received."}

{"text":"Great pizza, great subs. Delivery was a little slow but the quality of the food was worth it. Probably some of the best Italian in little Italy."}
{"text":"I lived next to Valentino's for about 3 years, so I guess you could say I'm a little biased.  I love this place.

The pizza is great and so are the dinners.  Valentino's has some of the best meatballs that I have ever tasted.  It is not advertised on the menu, but ask for the meatball pizza.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This has to be one of my favorite pizza places in Cleveland, period!  Everything is fresh and made to order.  The crust is thin but not crispy.  You can tell it's fresh made dough. The sauce is not too tangy but yet not too sweet, and you can taste different herbs in it. The topping are fresh. The cheese is awesome as well!  This is a very authentic pizza place, not at all big boxed like other pizza places.  If you're not in the mood for pizza, they also have subs, salad and pasta dishes as well.  You'll pay a little bit more than with most places, but it is well worth it!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza joint in Little Italy. Thin crust, nice bright tomato sauce with a perfect amount of cheese. Quaint dinning patio when the weather permits right to the side of the restaurant, but otherwise, this is a no-frills, take-out pizza joint."}
{"text":"Best. Pizza. Ever....I don't live in Cleveland anymore but will drive up just for this pizza."}
{"text":"The crust is the best feature. I would expect Little Italy to have better pizza. Both places are kind of weak. The sandwiches are pretty good at Valentino's. There are better options on the east side for pizza, it is superior to Mama Santa's though. The prices are also fair. Worth eating once."}
{"text":"I'm so happy to hear Valentino's is still going strong!  i was a regular back in the 80's when i lived in U.C.  I sure do miss their white pizza with artichoke hearts and kalamata olives!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've tried in Cleveland. It's not pricey at all and the dough is amazing. The service is always pretty good too."}
{"text":"I was excited to try s slice after reading a lot of good reviews on this place. Ick. I'm hoping it was only bad b/c it was a slice that had been sitting there a while??  If I get a chance I'll have to try ordering an entire pizza to see if I feel differently!"}
