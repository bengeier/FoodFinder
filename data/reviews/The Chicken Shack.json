{"text":"Excellent chicken and great service and the fried chicken is to die for. What else can you say other than try this place, you'll like it."}
{"text":"Forget all the chains ,Forget the Bars, Forget Canes They can't compare to the chicken shack.They have a top quality product and they deliver the goods every single time.  You have read the reviews and they are all true. If you order 5 fingers and fries you better be hungry there is nothing frozen here and the quality of the chicken is amazing!  The fries are like shoestring fries seasoned lightly and you get a big portion of them with your combo.  The wings are just as large I ordered the 3 fingers and 3wings a great way to try them both.  Better choices of types of sauce too but the best way is plain with sauce on the side  Come Hungry and Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. The chicken and fries are amazing and pretty cheap for the amount you get. I am a regular eater here."}
{"text":"There are not enough great things to say about this place The people who own/work there are thee nicest people The food is outstanding IT'S ALL ABOUT CHICKEN! Haven't tried the wings yet but have no doubt they are as delicious as the chicken fingers LIGHTLY breaded, huge breast meat perfectly cooked fingers Fries are perfection Sauces are incredible (many choices) FAST FRIENDLY CLEAN DELICIOUS!!"}
{"text":"I usually love this place, but tonight around 6;45 (they are open until 9), the employee lied and say the \"Fryer was down...\"  It was obvious he just wanted to leave.  I am fine with places closing early on the eve of holidays, but they need to post it ahead of time, not lie. Disappointed. Not sure if we will return...."}
{"text":"To all my 250 plus repeat customers and potential new customers.  I need to be clear about a review I saw on yelp.   Josephia C commented about chemicals on the grill.  It's soap and water in a industrial spray bottle.  Fries are made to order and can sometimes be soggy. Not always perfect, but neither are McDonald,s fries.  We make to order.  Striving everyday to get better. Older gentleman talking at front of house to a guy, was not an employee, but a customer. All foh employees are female cashiers.   Take a look at Josephia C reviews, if real name and not disgruntled ex-employee. 5 bad reviews and nothing good to say about any place they have been to or maybe previously worked.  I'm sorry, The Shack isn't perfect, but my wife and I take our business serious and will always strive to make it better.  Just remember, everyone has an agenda, look at what you read here objectively.  Thanks for business!"}
{"text":"This place was good. Good price for wings, fries and a drink. Two of my boyfriends chicken fingers were overdone but overall will be coming back. Place stayed busy"}
{"text":"Our chicken shack is the best chicken fingers i have ever eaten anywhere. Their portions are great, the service is impeccable . their food is so fresh, crisp breading, quality chicken. Thank goodness we are lucky enough to have you here."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite spots , the service , the food , and especially the ranch were perfected ! I couldn't ask for more !  Keep doin what your doin"}
{"text":"Awsome wings and chicken, plenty of different sauces,  1.00 beers!"}
{"text":"Excellent chicken, excellent service. Feels like they've been here for years. Great stop on the way out of vegas. Damn good chicken."}
{"text":"We stopped in here after a quick side trip to the Hoover Dam. We chose it solely based on Yelp reviews and we were not let down! The place is an old car hop joint, but no car service. We walked inside and took a look at the large menu board. At first it looked pretty extensive, but in the end it boils down to various combinations of chicken fingers and wings. We all had chicken fingers with fries and I had also had a few wings as well. The chicken fingers were big, fat pieces of white meat with a light batter. They were amazing! Juicy inside and the batter was not overly seasoned. They were not dripping oil either. The fries were the \"shoestring\" variety that were perfectly cooked. Crispy on the outside and fluffy (as fluffy as shoestring fries can be) on the inside. There were many options for dipping sauces (we all opted for some variation of BBQ) and it was decent too. I was a little disappointed to see jugs of \"Sweet Baby Ray's\" sauce on shelves in the back when I used to bathroom, but it worked for us. I opted for \"hot\" wings and they were also perfectly fried and the \"hot\" sauce was a nice compromise of spiciness and flavor.   The owner (or maybe just a manager?) came out to the picnic table were were eating at outside to ask how we were enjoying the food. He was happy and really seemed to care. Not just going through the motions. I thought it was a nice touch.  I would definitely stop here again if I were to be in the area and needed a fix of fried chicken!"}
{"text":"Very tasting wings, I prefer them to the tenders because to me, the wings have more flavor. I also like that the wings are breaded then fried so they are extra crunchy. I recommend avoid going in within 30 minutes or even an hour of closing. We got there a little after 7, got our food after 7:30, and were still chowing down around 8. The guys working there though were putting the chairs up the second customers leave the table. I understand there's a lot of prep work and cleaning they have to do after closing, but it made me feel like I needed to hurry up and get out of there. It also doesn't create a very welcoming atmosphere for customers who are coming in to eat."}
{"text":"If you like chicken wings with a pound of breading and batter on them then this is your.place. You cant get there chicken wings unbreaded at all instead you get a mouthful of oily batter. The fries were not bad but not amazing there were just average fries."}
{"text":"Firstly the chicken tenders have a great crunch with moist breast meat. The fries are skinny, crunchy golden brown goodness.   Portions are huge! Each tender is about 4 inches long. Not realizing how big the tenders were I ordered a five piece combo and was amazed at the size of the tenders and the mound of fries! There are 22 sauces to choose from! The fry sauce is delish and the best complement to the fries. I tried the BBQ and Chipotle BBQ sauces. I was expecting small cups so I doubled up! One container of each sauce is more than enough!   You can call your order in advance and it will be ready for you.  Ill try the wings next time!   It's worth a try!"}
{"text":"I've been to chicken shack a lot of times without complaint so I was really dissapointed when I went last night I ordered 3 tenders mild, but when I got it home it was a bit thrown together the sauce was not fully on the chicken and it was way hotter this time maybe a medium   they forgot my ranch dressing and to make things worse the chicken tasted as if they made it earlier and put  it in the microwave  to rewarm it ,it had that texture.. chicken shack is one of my favorite chicken places please don't start going down hill you guys are the bomb! And why did you get rid of fruit punch from the beverage machine??? Anyways I will not give up on you yet you guys deserve another chance this has been my one and only complaint about you ever."}
{"text":"First  things first - the chicken strips.  Big, juicy, crispy, greasy deliciousness.  I got them plain with bbq on the side for dipping.  Yum.  Shoestring fries also good, the price for the combo is very fair.  Why only 3 stars?  Well, I hate to pile on but previous reviewers are right - the tables/eating area is a dump.  Come on Chicken Shack, either hire someone to clean up the place or have one of your current workers spend a few minutes out of each hour wiping down tables, emptying trash and mopping up.  My shoes were sticking to the floor it was so bad.  I told myself that the cleaning problem was probably just limited to these areas, since I wanted that chicken, but it's not hard to extrapolate and think that the kitchen might not be so great either.  These aren't the kind of thoughts you want your customers to have."}
{"text":"I always get the 3 finger with fries and drink and normally it has four fingers in it. Four gigantic fingers. Delicious. Love this spot"}
{"text":"This place was delicious! Everyone was super friendly. The chicken tenders are juicy and big. We got 10 tenders to split and I was only able to eat 3, lucky me I get leftovers. We came in right as they closed (we didn't watch our time enough) and they served us and the 2 families who came in right after. If you're in this area, I highly recommend this place. Wonderful chicken!"}
{"text":"Lets start with the fact that - this place is great! Too bad I found out about it only couple of weeks ago. The guys that work there were on a positive note, and those chicken fingers and fries are just delicious, the only thing that I didn't like was the amount of people, the place was full, that's because I came at around 3pm, and that's the time that hungry students get out of school. They need to get a bigger place for sure, because those chicken fingers have a big future! They deserve every star of the five that I put."}
{"text":"On vacation to Hoover Dam and found this spot along the way, was going to settle for Taco Bell up the street but so glad I didn't!!!! THE BEST CHICKEN FINGERS I'VE EVER HAD! The sauces are amazing as well. Wish I lived in the area because I would be here at least twice a week. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite chicken places. It is so good! I get the #3, 3 chicken fingers with chili cheese fries, with ranch & fry sauce. Absolutely delicious! My boyfriend got the #2 , 5-6 chicken finger combo with regular fries, and spicy blue cheese sauce. Amazing!! Must go. We watched Star Wars on their tv while we waited for our food which was awesome."}
{"text":"Great wings big size wings french fries you're just like I like them hot and crispy services spectacular I'll definitely recommend it to come back or anybody else come here"}
{"text":"What an amazing place !! Omfg I love their chicken big pieces of chicken & great flavor options. The place has funny things on the wall & it's cozy. The staff is so nice & very helpful if its your first time or just cant decide. I've been here 3 times in the past month... Yea I'm addicted :)"}
{"text":"I was just there yesterday order for the whole Fam  best wings ever!!!!! Love the fries too."}
{"text":"YUM!  Real chicken breast - delicious.  Chili cheese fries and baked beans were also great. Good size portions and decent price.  Will definitely come back.  Bonus - in the same shopping center as Galaxy theaters."}
{"text":"I shop at the Smith's next to this place all the time there's always a packed house here so I thought I'd give it a shot and I ordered a chicken sandwich and that's exactly what I got just a chicken sandwich nothing special not overly tasty just plain maybe I'm the bad apple don't spoil it for the bunch but I'm not overly impressed and I probably won't go back no make that for sure I won't go back"}
{"text":"Oh man-- I think at one point I've gained about 5 lbs from being so addicted to their chicken. When it comes to chicken, my husband is a monster (you know like cookie monster ...except with chicken :)) This is hands down one of our favorite fried chicken spots. The chicken is lightly breaded, perfectly seasoned, and juicy on the inside. Service is always pretty friendly. Oh and the fries are delicious! We're hooked."}
{"text":"When I get a craving for hot wings this is my go to spot. Love the shoestring fries. They've got sweet tea. Seating is limited since the place is small. It can get packed during lunch. Everything is cooked to order so expect to wait a few mins for your order. I always call ahead especially when it's busy. Great customer service."}
{"text":"Without a doubt some of the finest boneless chicken in town. There are a lot of options in terms of flavoring of the wings so you don't get just boring plain or hot wings. My wife absolutely love the fries and sometimes just orders that from the place.  The staff there is top notch and the atmosphere is great. Love the feeling of eating at a sports bar without the smoke or rude customers.  The only thing I dislike is the size. Wish the place was bigger but I'm sure that will happen somewhere down the line as the place becomes too popular for their current location."}
{"text":"Before leaving Vegas we visited the chicken shack. We ordered 12 wings An fries. The meal was out An hot within minutes. Nice size wings a bit on the salty size as well as the shoestring fries. Staff allowed us to taste test sauces before placing our order. Decent price, restaurant on the small size only around 8 tables."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner on the way to Vegas.  Amazing,  juicy real chicken.  Delicious, ready quickly and friendly staff worth the grab n go or to actually sit.  It's not a big restaurant or extravagant but definitely worth the stop."}
{"text":"Have to keep it short and sweet.  Best size wings in town..  I had about 3-4 of them and got full!  I'd recommend to others!"}
{"text":"I am absolutely in love with this place. I don't know what they do or how they do it but I find myself craving their chicken strips all the time. I would like to try other things on the menu but I feel like if I don't order the chicken strips I will regret it. The habenero honey is my favorite. Also, this place is reasonably priced. Chicken strips, drinks and fries usually come out $6/person."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and flavors! Excellent sercive! Great friendly  atmosphere. Great music!  All around awesome!"}
{"text":"Awesome overload! An absolute must try..best damn chicken around. You won't be disappointed!! Yummy!!"}
{"text":"It is not good. The chicken is dry and very hard. I can't stand the chicken. The chicken they serve at my school is moist and spicy. I rather review my school food. Don't go its a waste money."}
{"text":"the kids menu was good enough. chicken always good but didn't care for the fries! ranch is good, also had more fingers for me and , side of beans, really yummy and a side of potato salad that was ok. the cashier guy was really friendly and helpful. Notice the back door opened, and well health dep dont like that. I will totally go back and get some other sides"}
{"text":"Loved this spot!  All the variety of sauces. Great chicken. Perfect to stop before heading back to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Fantastic! We used to get just the grilled chicken fingers as we try ro be health conscious, but the breading they use is very light and males the fingers come out delicious, the insides are moist and tender and break apart able to dip in their  multitude of fantastic sauces. Add on a giant beer for only $3 and this meal can't be beat!"}
{"text":"I been coming here a couple times and it has to be one of my favorite spots to eat chicken wings and chicken fingers.the prices aren't bad and the customer service is attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Great chicken, not a fancy place but nice.  The place was crowed, the mark of good food!  I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My family and I had dinner with Jaime W. and Shirley B. It was quite lovely. I got what most people would get. Chicken fingers and fries. The fries were da bomb diggity. Dip them in ranch, perfection. I would want to be buried in these. The fingers were decent as well. Dip them in ranch as well, they will be tons better. (I am in an open relationship with ranch.) It was pretty grimy there though. Doesn't see like they clean the tables. You sit, you clean up your mess, with the exception of a few crumbs and papers. You order at the desk, so the staff probably doesn't see the nastiness of their tables, other than a quick glance when they bring your food. It was sticky. You can get over it once you eat though. Just wash your hands after and you'll be as fresh as a daisy."}
{"text":"Great little place for a quick meal. Chicken wings, fries and salad were perfect to end our day. Found on Yelp and trusted the reviews - thanks"}
{"text":"I love eating at Chicken Shack! They provide generous portions, and the chicken fingers are to die for! They also serve beer to wash down all that delicious unhealthiness! The only deterrence is all the construction happening on Sunset Road. All that construction and lane closures is a joke!!!"}
{"text":"Very hit or miss, depending on who is doing the cooking. If it is the older guy, he was the actual chef from the old Chicken shack, and he makes bangin' wings. The hispanic guy messed up my order 3 times out of 4 so far, he is the chef \"in training\" but seriously, its just wings, you make them all day, it cant be that hard? Mostly he makes the wings plain and gives you a tiny side of whatever sauce you asked for to dip in. This is WRONG. When I order \"habanero honey\" I want the wings smothered in that delicious sauce. That should be the default way, always.   This is in Cactus Jack's saloon, and the reason why I believe is because the bar rents out the kitchen to the Chicken Shack guys. From a logical standpoint, it makes sense because its cheaper than leasing one of the empty storefront's next door and installing a new kitchen, but it may be something they want to consider for the long run. I have no problem going in a bar to get the food, but I can see how some would think this to be an annoying and avoidable step.  1/5 when the hispanic is the cook (so far, maybe hell step his game up), 4/5 when it is the older man."}
{"text":"Clean and pretty good chicken strips. The price is not bad. I don't like it as much as my favorite chicken place which is Raising Caines but still it's good food."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The wings were great (and I'm not partial to bartered wings), the guy at the front nice and so was Steve the cook. I mean the man gave us a free sample of their cold slaw because we weren't sure if we'd like it or not. Needless to say we got a side of slaw.  Overall great experience. I'd roll back there again.   Keep up the excellent food and service fellas!"}
{"text":"Big portions the chicken wing as well as the fingers were delicious. It wasn't very expensive and I got my food quicker than I expected. I got the hot Sauce on my wings and it wast very spicy but the taste was delicious and went perfect with the ranch. Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Really good chicken fingers and the fries were great as well! They give you a LOT of food so come hungry! We didn't try any of the sauces this time but I'm sure we will be back and we'll give them a try then. The dining room is small and can get loud, but everything was clean."}
{"text":"Definitely the best wings I have had eating out. They have a pretty awesome deal Including wings, fries and a pitcher of beer for like 20 bucks. Highly recommend this place if your looking for solid wings!"}
{"text":"We ordered the 10 piece chicken fingers and small fries to go.  Although the quantity of food was well worth the money the quality was severely lacking.  The chicken was on the chewy side but what really was bad was that the breading had so much salt in it that you couldn't eat it.  Same goes for the fries - way too much salt.  We were very disappointed in that the one other time we tried a Chicken Shack was the one on Sunset and it was very good."}
{"text":"Ok so my husband and I stopped here on our way through and it was the BEST decision we've made in weeks. The way they cook their chicken is one-of-a-kind... it's savory, juicy, melts in your mouth, the breading is perfect, and adds just the right amount of spice. Plus it's whole pieces of chicken breast, not the prepackaged stuff. We had the fingers, which would be perfect on their own but there's also numerous sauces to choose from. And on top of it, we received great customer service from the woman working there.   If you're a fan of chicken, you will NOT regret coming here! I would drive out of my way to eat at this place. Chicken Shack - were comin' back!!"}
{"text":"I came in earlier today with a friend of mine to catch up really quick on old times. It had to be a quick meet up because she was on a half hour lunch break. We picked Chicken Shack because it was close to her job and from all of word of mouth advertising made me really want to try out this place. I ordered a five strip meal with fries and selected spicy blue cheese and honey habanero sauce on the side. Few minutes later, my both mine and my friends food came out rather quickly with a clean and concise presentation. Eating the food, I can tell that they use quality products and they pay attention to detail with cooking. Nothing was skimped on and the sizes of everything were proportionate. I found myself really enjoying the food, however my eyes were bigger than my stomach. When I went up to the counter, the gentleman working at the counter already knew I needed a to go box without asking. So I can honestly say I will be back here. Clean place, great food, and friendly staff. Count on me coming back and recommending all of my friends to eat here!"}
{"text":"Great stop from Lake Mead or Hoover Dam, the food was fresh and delicious, the service was even better!! We wish we would have know about this place sooner!"}
{"text":"The chicken is really good here, but it is interesting because the thing I like the most is their bacon cheeseburger. I know you might be saying, who gets a burger at a chicken place, but think about it... would a chicken place even be selling a burger if it werent good??? hmmm??? If you are a fan of burgers you got to try it out. It's big. It's good. It will rock your world."}
{"text":"My Brother took me here on a road trip. I hadn't even gotten my food yet, but they let me sample a piece of tender (fingers) and it's probably the best I've ever had. Garlic parm wings are on point and a large fries is enough for 2-3 people. Fabulous food and good people running the place, which makes a lot of difference. I'll be back."}
{"text":"This location is laughable when compared to the original on Sunset. As part of Cactus Jacks Saloon your stuck walking into a smoky bar, dealing with a rude bartender/waitress who may or may not want to help you unless you are a regular I guess, and if you are under 50 be prepared to be gawked at when entering and stared at as you sit down. Came in at 4pm on a Thursday and I sat for 3 minutes without help and ended up walking out as no one was around to help me and I was getting tired of being stared at. As I was walking out the bartender finally came out from the back and didn't even make an effort.   Where I would give their original location 5 stars I wouldn't even step foot in this place again. There is a open store front in the same complex just like you have on Sunset - just open up in there chicken Shack! I would be back and give you business weekly! Putting yourselves INSIDE a locals bar that caters to older and depressing community ruins it and makes it unapproachable and disappointing as I really enjoy your chicken and your wonderful staff on Sunset."}
{"text":"I go there with my girls and mom. We love it! I dont like honey mustard that much but theirs is really, really good.  Chicken is excellent!  My mom loves the fries! It get really busy at lunch and the place is small. So plan ahead, i would say"}
{"text":"Had the chicken strips sandwhich.   Was vey good.  The chicken was hot juicy and good flavor.  The fries and chicken surprisingly were not super greasy."}
{"text":"Hands down best chicken you can get fast for a great price!!!  I've been going here every now and then for about 6 years now since back in the \"chicken bonz\" days and highly recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"Not sure why there was no mgr on duty when i called to complain about my horrible meal, who  close's  the place??!! My ff were xxx crisp, like burnt, and wayyy too much salt, as was my cheeseburger, salted xxxx!!?? Could not hardly eat it. Saw similiar reviews of excess salt on yelp! Is the cook trying to have this business fail! Also gave me a warm slice of romaine lettuce!! Yuck!! With owners not even there, and clueless cooks, i wont be back!!"}
{"text":"Here's the deal with this location located on Sunset Rd.   The chicken is good as long as it's not overcooked. In my experience of going to this location at least a dozen times it's about a 50/50 chance of whether the chicken will be really good or flat out burnt. I have learned to ask for the chicken to be cooked on the spot and to say \"don't overcook it.\"   The manager has not been very professional on a couple of occasions. She basically didn't want to hear about the problems in her store and just proceeded to talk over me. I wasn't to happy about this, but I did like the chicken so I was eventually willing to overlook this and she was more professional on visits thereafter.   What really pissed me off big time was on my last and final visit. The girl who works the register (heavy set, short dark hair, butch looking) did something which I find pretty bad. We ordered our food, I sent my 17 year old autistic child up to the counter with a $1 bill to buy an extra dipping sauce which is 59 cents or there about. He gave her the $1 bill, yet she didn't give the kid any change. She just kept it. We are only talking about .40 cents or so, but that's not the point! She knew the kid didn't know any better and she took advantage of it. I walked up and said something, but she acted as if she didn't know what I was talking about.  For these reasons and mainly the last, I will never return to this location ever again. The employee who did this is constantly on her phone, tables are dirty, floors and walls are dirty, yet she stays on her phone instead of cleaning.   This has been my experience, yours may vary."}
{"text":"100% recommend whether you live in the area or are just passing through, you don't want to miss this place! The staff is super friendly, food is ready to eat within minutes of ordering and you can see them make it!"}
{"text":"Anna, the owner of this family run business, greeted us warmly and helped us navigate the menu. She brought out a piece of chicken, freshly fried, when she learned that we had not tried it.  We ordered up a fury!  Delicious. The chicken is perfect and we all picked a different homemade sauce. Everything is fresh - never frozen.  French fries are divine.  This is a great stop on the way to or from lake mead and the Hoover dam!"}
{"text":"good \"hole-in-the-wall\". great chicken. a touch salty, but still pretty damn good, hand-breaded and fresh.   i give it an overwhelming thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Best wings in vegas.  Large serving size and great price. They offer kids meals as well great family stop. The jokes on the wall provide entertainment and make the chicken shack a fun environment."}
{"text":"Best chicken fingers I've had in a long time!  Loved the tangy dipping sauce choices.  The skinny fries were perfectly salted and delicious."}
{"text":"We were thankful to have found this place after a long drive today!  I'm so glad we skipped the hotel restaurant and went to the chicken shack.  The food was excellent, the portions were nice and the service was friendly and welcoming.  This will be a place to visit whenever in Boulder City."}
{"text":"This Chicken Shack location is da bomb!!  Super friendly and fast.  Food ALWAYS on point.  Those of you who are  Cane's supporters.....you're missing out!!!  Chicken Shack has HUGE, juicy pieces of chicken.  Mounds of fries.  Endless dipping sauce choices which are flavorful and just add to the chicken experience. I refuse to eat at Cane's or KFC ever again.  Give me Chicken Shack or give me nothing!!! :)"}
{"text":"Best chicken in town  bww, wing stop, chick filet all mediocre this is where it's at. So many flavors to pick. Hot BBQ is my shiznit if ur in the area of one stop by!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here a couple times now, and although it's on the other side of town we go out of our way to go. I love the chicken it's super soft and tender, ranch and buffalo sauce and we're set!! It is a little hard to find a table but it's worth it."}
{"text":"The food had hairs in it. They're very stingy with there sauces. Don't wear proper hair nets in kitchen so don't be surprised if you find a hair are two in your meal !!! When you walk in they don't greet you how you'd like"}
{"text":"This is our new go to wing joint, and let me just get this out of the way...This place serves some big ass wings!!! My husband and I crack up every time, wondering where the hell do they get these chickens?!  Soo.. big juicy, crispy well cooked wings and delicious sauces. (we've only tried a few so far) The chile-lime was yum, the habanero honey was sweet/spicy heaven for me. Both kids like the honey bbq, and occasionally we order the dry spiced wings for when we don't feel like getting down and dirty. They have lemon pepper and garlic parmesan, both good. The fries are super skinny, and that's a nice change...very crisp.  So why not 5 stars? I hate that they offer big packages, 25, 50 or 100 wings but you may only have 2 different flavors in those packages. I don't know if it's like that at other places or not, but regardless, I think it's lame.  The second reason is that there are always dirty tables. Every time we've been, we've searched for the least dirty table and watched the other ones sit there un-wiped for the duration of our stay. You may be  understaffed due to the economy, but the tables have to be wiped down. No one wants to sit at someone else's mess. On the bright side, you can phone in your order, walk in and pick it up and bypass the dirty tables."}
{"text":"I am a chicken man  this place is pretty good. Clean seating environment. Took a while to get the food but it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Jack of few trades, but master of all, is what I say about this place.  Their chicken fingers and fries are top quality and arrive at your table, fresh, hot and crispy.  They have an amazing selection of dips for your chicken, and you're usually chewing down within 5 minutes of ordering.  Staff are wonderful, especially this Steve guy who treats you as if he's known you forever - very welcoming and a joy to return to - EVERY TIME!"}
{"text":"Love, Love ,Love the new Chicken Shack in Boulder City!   We ate there with some friends last night and it was awesome! The chicken is so juicy and tasty it makes me want to go back for more today! The sauces offered are super! especially like the sweet chili!  Keep up the good work CS!"}
{"text":"Hard to mess up chicken fingers, right? I agree. The shitty gas station tenders can be pretty damn good in a pinch. But this place?! Man, this place does it right.   The fingers are perfectly HOT when they come out and the inside remain juicy while they are nice and crispy on the outside.   The variety of sauces really makes it so I don't get sick of the place. You can always find a new combo.   On days I don't feel like fries with them, they happily sub a different side.   And, to warm the dark cackles of my heart, they offer both ranch AND blue cheese as dipping sauce.  No, the staff isn't the most warm and fuzzy and happy group. But this isn't  a Guy Savoy fine dining experience-all I care about is getting my fingers fast, hot, and crispy. And that they do."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today and I must say this place was amazing!! I'm not usually into chicken strips and fries but this place changed my mind. Great choices for dips and the price is great! Fed my family of 7 for less than $55 and they ALL agreed it was a repeat."}
{"text":"I don't know if it was the heat of the moment when I had my first bite, but in my opinion, this beats Buffalo Wild Wings and Wingstop. That's means a lot coming from me especially since I love eating chicken wings haha.  Nice little hole-in-the-wall location right in the Smith's shopping center. Place is a little small to eat at during the lunch rush, so I recommend just taking your order to-go.   My favorite sauces to order are creamy garlic parmesan and creamy hot bbq. So delicious! I feel like it's almost a guilty pleasure. Overall, good food and good vibes."}
{"text":"This is a little hole in the wall place in a Smiths parking lot. I would've normally just overlooked it if a friend hasn't give me a gift card.   Chicken Shack does chicken justice. I had some of the best chicken strips I've ever tasted. Their grilled chicken sandwich was similarly tasty. The choices of sauce are add nice variety and flavor. Further, the portions are generous.  However, the Chicken Shack's strength is also the major weakness. The focus is on chicken such that there aren't many non-chicken selections. There is salad and burgers, but it seems to defeat the purpose of going to a chicken specialty restaurant.  Take home point: if you're craving delicious chicken, this is a good place to satisfy that hunger."}
{"text":"I was craving chicken tenders and I came across this place. We came during lunch so the line was long but moved pretty quickly. Small space but we did get a table to sit down and eat at. Everything was hot. It took awhile to get a rogo box but like I said it was lunch time. I will return next time I want chicken tenders!"}
{"text":"Love the Chicken Shack! Have gone to the one in Henderson on Sunset. Wish they had a location on the southwest side of Las Vegas! Good fresh food and always great service w a smile!"}
{"text":"First and last trip the Chicken Shack. Ordered the 5 piece strip combo and chicken salad. The strips were large but unremarkable with little flavor. There is a wide variety of sauces, but that doesn't make up for the flavorless chicken. The salad is just lettuce with some cut up strips on top and a choice of several dressings. Kane's, Popeyes, KFC, or Subway are better options."}
{"text":"So I thought I would give this place a visit ,seeing that I do like to support my neighborhood food joints. Well let me tell u the honest truth, I should of continue going to Kohls to shop instead of stopping here to grab some chicken! I ordered the 6 piece wings and the chili fries ,which came out to 13.33 with tip now anyone in their right mine know that u can buy a 14 piece of chicken pack at Sam's club for 10.00. I was hungry and delusional so I knew I had to stop and try this chicken now to quench my hunger ! Man I was sadly disappointed someone must of poured a whole bottle of salt on the chicken so much so I tried to wipe it off with napkins to no avail I was screwed there was no hope , the chili was so so whatever that means . In ending this review there is a lesson here shopping or a quick bite at the chicken shack ? U decide."}
{"text":"My son and I normally love this place and always come when we are in Henderson. Yesterday I wanted to take some out of town guest to try it out because they live so close, but unfortunately the wing we're horrible this time. They tasted as if they were precooked and heated to serve. I felt bad for bringing the guest because normally we have a great experience. I hope this was just a one time issue because my son loves this place and would like to return. I appreciate fast service but if that doesn't mean my wings are cooked to order than I don't mind waiting longer to have good fresh food."}
{"text":"Ive been going  to  the chicken  shack in  henderson  on sunset the service is awesome  and if i could i would  give a 10 out of 10 the reason is because  of  one young lady that works there she is awesome  her name is Priscilla shes always friendly  and she always has a smile and the food is great thanks chicken  shack for making it a wonderful  experience  for my family  and  I"}
{"text":"We're new to the area, so when we asked the kids what they wanted to eat, our daughter suggested this place we seen on the way to Hoover Dam.   I'm glad we gave it a try. The service was friendly and the customers were as well.   For the price you pay, you get a whole lot.We had the chicken fingers, with 2 large sides and 4 drinks. It was enough to satisfy our hunger. Everything we ordered was yummy, esp the bbq baked beans. If we're ever in the area again, we're definitely going to stop by again to try something new!"}
{"text":"Now this establishment takes the award for best customer service of the day. When you come here you get such a homey feeling where you can just relax and eat good food.   Like it's name suggests the Chicken Shack specializes in Chicken; Chicken Sanwiches, Chicken wings, Chicken Fingers, Chicken Everythang!!   My friend Anthony and I had the honor of trying the \"6 piece chicken fingers with medium sauce\" and the \"chicken sandwich\" both of which were cooked to the point of perfection. The meat was so tender that it would literally melt in your mouth.   And while we were enjoying our meal the cook had overheard that it was our first time at the establishment, so he brought out a sample side of wings with 2 of their different flavors of sauces!! Honey Jabanero and Sweet Chilli, which completely topped off out whole eating experience!  As we finished our meal we noticed how much like family they treated all of their customers. While calling regulars by their names and with greetings like \"Aye!!!\" But what really caught my attention was their willingness to help one of their customers who had a fairly large to go order, out to their car. That's something that's not at all necessary but it's nice to know that they would go that far for their customers.   Overall my experience here was 5 stars for their amazing overall vibe. We'll be back Chicken Shack!"}
{"text":"The workers, presumably the owners, were as nice as can be: extremely courteous and outgoing. We got the chicken fingers and a dbl burger. The chicken was good- it reminded us of Raising Canes. They were a touch on the dry side, but we'd definitely recommend and will get them again ourselves. The burger was really good. Everything from the meat to the lettuce were very fresh. The fingers and burger came with an extremely generous portion of french fries. The fries were delicious! We really enjoyed our first visit and we'll definitely stop in again!!"}
{"text":"worst service ive ever had, it took forever to get my food when it was almost empty, the food wasnt even good, undercooked, pink chicken with no flavor, please dont waste your money on this place"}
{"text":"We ordered the chicken wings and fingers.  Tried a few sauces - hot, lemon pepper and habanero honey.  Hot was standard buffalo sauce, lemon pepper was TOO salty and the habanero honey was great (not too sweet with a slight kick at the end).  The hot and habanero honey were sauces but the lemon pepper was a dry rub.  I like my wings and fingers crunchy so next time I will ask for sauce/dry rub on the side.  Chicken was not dry and the portion size was good.  The only negative thing was the cashier made a mistake on my order.  He offered to correct my order, but I would have to pay the difference.  No thanks, it was your mistake buddy.  Overall, the food was good and I liked the decor.  I don't expect mistakes to be made all the time so I think 3 stars is fair but my true rating would be 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Obsessed with this place !!!!  Better than Buffalo wild wings, better than wing stop just amazing! Their fries are the best and the staff is always nice !"}
{"text":"Picked the wrong day to come try this place!!!!! Called in my order for myself and a co-worker and specifically asked for sauce on the sides. Drove about 6 miles to pick up and of course the orders were incorrect. The girl who was working the register at 12:10 pm was rude, arrogant and had a HUGE attitude when I told her the orders were wrong. She started to have MORE of an attitude when I asked for the manager and she said \" anyways with you\" which I thought was beyond disrespectful. A male chef came out and tried telling me that I didn't order what I said I did over the phone but yet I spoke to a female on the phone to place my order...how does that make any sense?? The male chef asked me what I ordered and I told him, he then went back to the kitchen and fixed my order. By the time my order was fixed I had already lost 23 minutes into my 45 min lunch break from work!! I will NEVER go back to this disrespectful place of business. On top of it all they screwed me out of a chicken finger when I ordered a 3 piece they only gave me 2 fingers and shorted out on the fries !!!!! This place sucks !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious!!!  The chicken was not overly breaded, so you can taste the juicy-ness of it.  Sauces were out of bounds, & the fries...I normally don't eat them, but today, I ate mine & some of my son's.  Yes, they're THAT good!  Service was friendly & fun.  My family & I HIGHLY recommend this place."}
{"text":"First time here. We ordered a chicken strip combo and 6 wings with the honey habanero. Chicken strip were excellent . Crispy and juicy. The wings were also awesome. Huge and good flavor. The only minus was the fries.  They were soggy and tasted like old fryer oil. If not for the fries it would of been 5 stars"}
{"text":"I was surprised by this place. It's in a not-so-great location (which makes it a little difficult to find), but they didn't disappoint. The chili lime sauce on chicken strips is great. I always order their sauces on the side, as the chicken is much crunchier (which I like) this way."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service!   We ordered take out over the phone and it was ready super fast. We are never disappointed with our meals. Sooooooo much food in each portion."}
{"text":"Chicken is pretty much my favorite food you name it Jack in the box McDonald's Wendy's I've tried all of it  When I tried canes when I was About 13 I never thought nobody can top that  I found something that did top it and it's chicken shack  It's the best place to grab chicken they give you massive amounts and usually throw in extra and you can get toppings like garlic parm or mild ETC  I usually get #2(5 piece) with garlic parm with garlic parm on the fries it can't get much better than that"}
{"text":"This small unassuming little restaurant off the side of the highway is a best secret that needs to be discovered. I was driving home after a 3 hour hike with my wife and dog, and we were really hungry, but for something really good, not just something to fill our stomachs. We saw the Chicken Shack, passed it to go to another restaurant, then decided to back up in the center lane and try this place out. It's small, but the food is delicious, the service is personal, and when you leave, you leave knowing you just had the best chicken fingers and wings around. The batter is light but favorable, no salt or extra spices needed, the french fries cooked to perfection, and the choice of sauces to choose from will cause you to stop and try to decide what you have a taste for; my favorite is the garlic sauce for my chicken.  They also went above and beyond my expectations, we said we had to take our food to go because we had our dog in the car; they gave a few extra pieces of chicken for our dog Dundee in his own container with his name on it; now that's a place of business that knows how to meet their customer's needs. Everything was so good, that we are recommending this place to all our friends. Keep it up Chicken shack; you know how to do it right."}
{"text":"Great food but service and cleanliness of the place need work. The place is always busy and it seems like more help is needed."}
{"text":"I stopped going to the chicken shack on sunset after two years of going atleast 2 times a week sometimes more because the place was always dirty even when it wasn't busy so I wondered what the back looked like the tables,chairs were always dirty the legs of the table and chairs were filthy...  It's been 18 months and I found out there was a new CS  so I came in tonight it wasn't busy the owner had just walked out the door ( I pretty sure it was him).  I ordered and my wife got us a table when getting to the table she showed me she had wiped it with just some water and paper towel.   It was black so I looked around and for this to be a newer place I'm disappointed.    So no more chicken shack."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places in town (or out of town, i should say) to eat. Ive taken my family here probably 30 times since it opened a couple of years ago and its great every time. Service and staff are always the best and Im pretty sure the same people have worked here since it opened. I think that says something. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"It's very unfortunate to write this kind of reviews but somehow they need to help other people not eating or making the same mistake. Me and my friend order 2 burgers of \" Angus meat\" that's what the girl said, everything was great until I tasted the burger, it was very salty and I say very salty!!!, and here is the thing we were approach by the manager or one of the girls in charge and she asked if everything was ok, and we told her that the burger was super salty and she apologizes and told the people at the back that the customer was unhappy with the burger and she remind them to don't add to much salt to the burgers. She came back after a few seconds and I thought she was going to offer us our money back or at least change our meals for something else, but NO she offer us RANCH DRESSING so that can we somehow make the salty taste go away!!! Can you imagine,  There are better options out there don't waste money and time, even McDonald's would be better compare to the great Angus burger ."}
{"text":"Not to much of a chicken person, but decided to join in with some friends. Chicken Stack is actually very good, I was pretty impressed. Got to bring my family here to try it they love chicken wings. This place is hidden in shopping center only way we knew about this place was through yelp."}
{"text":"Always delicious, always fresh.  My got too fast food place in Henderson. Just wish they were open later and that they delivered."}
{"text":"A friendly and tasty simple, quick stop joint! Hand breaded finger! Yummy shoe-string fries! And delicious homemade dipping sauces!"}
{"text":"Excellent stop for lunch. Chicken was well cooked, the service was fast and cheerful. Highly recommend this Chili-lime sauce, spicy and tart. Cook recommends it for shrimp too."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best chicken tenders, wings, and fries around. The service is friendly and fast."}
{"text":"My family and I tried the fingers, wings, and chili fries. I liked the wings the best.  Service was exceptional for a wing joint. The cashier was very friendly and helpful and the cook/owner(?) came out from the back and let us try the secret \"kitchen\" sauce that wasn't on the menu."}
{"text":"Excellent service second only to the top notch food. Love the wings with blue cheeze.  Owner cam over the table and asked how the food was.  Great place.  Do yourself a culinary treat and stop in.  Beware. ...portions are large!"}
{"text":"The fries were really good, but the chicken fingers were a little chewy. Plus, they didn't have milkshakes."}
{"text":"The wings here at the chicken shack are subpar simply. They are oversized, underseasoned, BREADED (which should be mentioned) and have lackluster sauces!  I believe this restaurant is surviving on the massive portions versus the quality! These wings are by far the worst I have EVER had and I eat wings several times a wing from great places like Wingstop and Wings!  Stear clear of this place or you will be highly upset!"}
{"text":"EVERY time I visit Las Vegas, this is my first stop.  There are few food items in this world I would choose to eat over the Chicken Shack chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"Called ahead and ordered to go around 7:30pm. Once driving, I opened the box to grab some fries and noticed order was missing 2 tenders (5 pc order), & so i circled back to get rest of order. *not a huge deal, but definitely inconvenient*  The big issue here is that upon opening the lid of the box there immediately was a very foul and overbearing smell which reeked of rubber/old dirty oil. I mentioned this to the staff and was told, \"it's fried so its going to smell and taste like oil\". I left, as I was in a hurry and figured once I dunk it in hot sauce and ranch it wouldn't be bad.   While driving, I took a bite and dipped the chicken into the buffalo sauce yet had the worse taste of butt/oil in my mouth.  After looking at them in the light closer, the chicken fingers were drenched and coated with a greasy/slime residue of oil and very soggy. The fries, unfortunately, were exactly the same and tasted like pure oil. I immediately lost my appetite. After only having a few bites of a chicken tender and a few fries my stomach soon after began to reject the food and  I had to pull over and puke.    I have eaten here several other times and the quality of food and way of which it was prepared has never been an issue. Not sure if maybe they had new cooks, if they hadn't cleaned out fryer properly (using old dirty oil), or if they just got lazy due to being later in night. Regardless, this should never of been an issue and it was a waste of my time, money, and messed my stomach up for the night.   I hate that I wrote a review only after having a bad experience as I've enjoyed chicken shack before, and for that reason alone I will give a 2 star rating. However, after eating/throwing up what was clearly food that was not prepared correctly and not suitable to eat, I doubt I will ever return here again or reccomend this establishment going foward.    Side note: good prices on beer and good location."}
{"text":"Dined on 9/2/2016.  Hands down, some of the best wings I've ever had. Big, juicy, flavorful, and cooked perfectly.  I went for the bone-in wings, the wife went for the boneless wings. The wings are breaded (so they are not naked), and this serves to soak up their sauce just fine. Just a heads up; the wings are so saucy that we found the sauce permeated the paper that the wings were served on. As the wings are served on a thin piece of paper, which sits in a plastic wire basket, my thoughts are that the heavy amount of sauce, and its acidity, eat away at the paper. Towards the end of the meal, we noted some holes in the paper and the pieces that tore away were mixed in with the sauce. I'd go so far to say that I probably ate a couple of pieces of the paper, but you know what? It was worth it. The wings are that good.  And the fries. While the wings are some of the best I've ever had, the fries are easily *the* best fries that I have ever had. And, we stopped in right after they opened for the day. So obviously they were nice and fresh; my point being, some places might have used the oil from the day before resulting in some not-so-fresh fries. Not these guys.  Last tip: use the restroom; you'll love the key."}
{"text":"Best chicken wings I have ever had. They buy their chicken fresh daily and use milk and flour to bread them. Family owned, fun atmosphere, great pricing, amazing chicken!"}
{"text":"Coworker and I visited the Hoover Dam before leaving town and the food at the Dam Visitor Center didn't look appealing. Quick Google and found this place on our way back...and what a gem!  Friendly staff/owner and super tasty chicken! The #4 combination gets you 3 wings, 3 fingers, fries and a drink - it was a huge portion! The fingers were crispy on the outside and juicy in the side, and wings were finger-licking good. The fries are truly the best in the world!! Everything was fried to golden perfection and no hint of grease...  Best fried chicken I had in a long time!!!"}
{"text":"Been going to the chicken shack since 07' when it was still Chicken Bonz on sunset. I was thrilled when chicken shack came to bc. Still is and ways will be my favorite place for chicken fingers and fries. Never had any better. Plus the people that work there are very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"I love this place!  We never miss a chance to go there when we are in town. BEST fried chicken EVER (and this comes from an East Texan who knows fried chicken!)"}
{"text":"Was cruising around looking for somewhere to eat and saw the line inside this little joint in a strip mall.  Thought I would try it.  Boy was it good!  I decided to get takeout and I was not disappointed. I got the #4 combo - wings and strips with fries.  They had many sauces to choose from and since no one was in line behind me, the counter guy was extremely accomodating by letting me taste a few sauces to see which one I wanted.  Good price for a quick, delicious meal!  Enjoy the Chicken Shack!"}
{"text":"We stopped here leaving Vegas for a quick lunch. I ordered the boneless chicken strips with fries and bbq sauce and ranch for dipping. The chicken was sooooo good! So fresh! Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The seasoning they use on the chicken it amazing, like mouth watering amazing! The staff was also super friendly! I will definitely be going here again!!"}
{"text":"Best chicken fingers ever! I absolutely love this place. The price is right for the amount of goodness you get. What makes this place different from the rest is definitely the SAUCE. The sauce is definitely the boss over here. Bar none. The fries are good, but not the best. Dip the fries in the sauce, then they turn into the best fries ever. Service is always friendly and top-notch. My favorite spot in Henderson.  I love the Jamaican Jerk, Spicy Teriyaki, and Hot Buffalo. They also have dry rub seasoning too."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and the food is consistently yummy.  The chicken tenders are fresh and lightly battered and very juicy.  The wings are equally yummy,  very light and crunchy on the outside with the perfect amount of spice and so juicy inside.  My son has been asking to try the burger so we finally let him get one and I  almost ate it! He got the double shack and it's proportion to the bun is perfect,  the bun itself was delicious as well, the veggies were very fresh and crisp.  I love the potato salad but others in my family didn't care for it, guess it's just your taste.  The fries are great, skinny and crispy.  Baked beans are pretty good,  just okay I  think but my husband loved them and then the chili with beans,  very good in my opinion, you can get it on your fries for a little extra or as side and they will add cheese, onion, sliced fresh jalapenos and sour cream for your pleasure. The only thing I  forgot so far was the coleslaw,  that probably is my least favorite, just not enough kick for me, some apple cider vinegar world fix that. All the sauces we tried so far have been really good too,  ranch, spicy ranch,  srirachi ketchup and a creamy garlic I think. The sauce cups are big!  Which I love since you're being charged for extras they give you more than enough.  This has been one of our go to places when I'm too lazy to make dinner."}
{"text":"Really happy with this place, my boyfriend and I ordered the 10 piece chicken fingers with half order tossed in hot and the other half tossed in the creamy parmesan garlic. Which the 10 piece is a perfect amount for 2 people by the way. Also ordered a small fry, which are skinny beer battered and they are awesome! Everything came out hot, really hot. My only recommendation to the place is the deli paper they serve the chicken on gets soggy. For us with the chicken fingers we wanted to dig in right away but being fresh out of the fryer we used a fork and knife to cut the sauced tenders and that's when the deli paper tears and your getting bites of paper. Its probably not a problem with the wings because let's face something ain't right if a person is cutting into a chicken wing, those are meant to be hand held. So only recommendation is to change the deli paper they serve the chicken on, especially the sauced tenders. I will be returning though to try the chili and other saucey flavors!!"}
{"text":"Great seasonings.  Decent size chickens and strips. Fries good. All around tasty. Yum yum... sweet chili sauce and habenero honey sauces were on point."}
{"text":"Best chicken ever... The breading on the chicken fingers is thin and crispy with a subtle spice, the meat is moist and tender. The owner says they never use frozen chicken breasts which is the reason it's so good. The fries are addictive; thin and crispy and always hot. They make their own fry sauce, and I think it's just great. My husband sometimes gets a salad, and he's never been disappointed.  The service is very friendly and the food comes out from the kitchen fast.  Cute decor, and the key fob for the restroom is a big rubber chicken. The only downside is that seating is limited, so once in a great while you have to wait to get a table. No big deal...the food is worth it. Another perk is that the building is an old drive-in, so there is covered parking. Love this place!"}
{"text":"This place is good my boyfriend comes here very often & couldn't wait till I try it. I would say it's good but maybe a little overrated. I'll probably come back my boyfriend request not mine."}
{"text":"Wings are juicy and crispy without being heavy on grease.   Good sauces. I get the honey habanero.   This location and BC location both excellent on food and customer service."}
{"text":"Nice people. Friendly, fast service. Great fingers. Many dipping options. I have eaten here many times. When my son comes to town from LA this place is on his list of must-haves."}
{"text":"This is the only restaurant my picky teenagers will eat chicken from. The chicken is always fresh, never dry, and breading is just enough.  Fries keep well-you can even freeze leftover fries.  They heat up nicely. We never have any chicken left over, but I'm sure it reheats well.   You MUST ask for extra fry sauce, though-that stuff is like crack. Dip everything in it!!"}
{"text":"Chicken shack is awesome! Food is delicious and staff is very friendly. The line is always long but don't let that turn you away. The service is fast so you won't be waiting long. The line was out the door when I arrived I was only there for 10 minutes by the time I got my food. Overall delicious and defiantly the best food place in Boulder city."}
{"text":"BEST WINGS EVER!! They also have some of the best sauces I've ever had!! Best ranch I've probably ever had! Great crispy fries!"}
{"text":"Decided to come here and try it for the first time. Atmosphere was cool a little crowded they were busy of course on a Saturday. I got the 5 finger combo with fries and drink came out to $10 bucks not bad. I took it to go. Let's start with the fingers they were very tasty with the ranch it was very good. The fries are very good but were a bit on the salty side. Maybe they put too much salt that day. But overall it was very good I will return again and I do recommend this place to anyone that loves chicken fingers."}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite place to get our yummy chicken wing and fries fix! But now not anymore..the person that they have up front is so terrible! No personality,her attitude totally suck,and has noo customer service..thank goodness for the new location as we from now on going to that one annd its closer to the house...I gave it 1 star but thats for the service,the food is still yummy!"}
{"text":"Nice place with a good local feel and laid-back atmosphere. Very tasty food, they have every dipping sauce you've ever dreamed of. Even if the food was only passable, I'd still come here for the great service with a smile provided by Taylor."}
{"text":"We just finished shopping at the neighboring CVS when we stumbled upon this newly opened Chicken Shack so we decided to try it out.   I got the 6pcs chicken fingers in mild sauce and my friend got the shack salad with fried chicken. The servings were so big we had to share everything. The salad was so good and the chicken fingers were so deliciously cooked to perfection. The french fries was so good, too. They were thinner than the usual cut served by other fast food chains and for some reason the thinly cut fries looked more appetizing.   The place was so clean and well lit and it had a sportsbar kind of vibe to it because of the overhead TVs but I like that they weren't loud at all so we were able to enjoy our food and our converstion.   The people were so friendly and the service was fast. We got so much more than what we paid for!   I will definitely visit this place everytime I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Delicious, tender and perfectly fried chicken. Cole slaw is great too. The service can't be beat. Make sure you stop here for a meal if you're heading through Boulder City before or after visitng Hoover Dam or Lake Meade."}
{"text":"i am done coming to this establishment, i am done with their oppression! i am a black, independent, single, mother and when i brought in my 7 kids they kicked me out because my children were disturbing their customers. my children are more important than anybody and i don't appreciate their actions. plus these people are racist. one of them called me a prostitute because he couldn't believe a black woman could afford a fendi bag! dumb privileged white people !"}
{"text":"I love chicken shack! I seriously would eat here everyday if I could. Food id ready in a flash and the wait staff is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Chicken Shack is a fantastic go-to for good chicken. The portions are generous and the chicken has always been tender and juicy. The chicken is slightly salted for flavor and I'm not sure if I could pick up on any seasoning, but the chicken is delicious nonetheless.  You have the option of getting a combination of chicken fingers, chicken wings, and/or fries. They had a wide array of dipping sauces, all of which are good when paired with the chicken and fries. I either get the 10 piece chicken fingers for $12.29 or the 5 piece chicken fingers, fries, and drink for $8.99. I usually get the habanero honey and honey mustard sauces. I've heard the garlic parmesan and lemon pepper are good sauces too.  The service is quick and there is not wait staff, so you have to get everything yourself if your forget it at the counter.  It's a very straightforward and simple restaurant, just chicken and fries, nothing else. If you're looking for a good chicken, check out Chicken Shack!"}
{"text":"I really like Chicken Shack. It's my guilty pleasure because of the grease, the chicken, and the variety of sauces you get to dip everything in. I feel like if Chicken Shack gave us more sauces to work with for free, that will help with bringing in more customers who want that variety.  The chicken itself is breaded and tender, but not crunchy, just crisp without the part where the flakes dig into your gums and inflame them. The fries are shoe string and fried to perfection (in my opinion). I really like InnOut fries, but Chicken Shack fries are up there in quality.  The honey garlic and habanero honey sauces are staples in my dipping inventory. Usually I get the 5 fingers and fries combo or I can get a 10 fingers with a small fries, either combination will have leftovers because there's so much food.  The staff is nice, not as fast as the Sunset location, and the facility is clean. It's much closer to where I live than Sunset so I've been coming here more often. Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"The chicken here is great (much bigger and tastier then raising canes) they have such a big selection of sauces, I'm a big fan of the Honey BBQ and the Cajun. I work nearby so I usually come here once a week and even though they can get pretty busy during the lunch hour, they have the food  ready super fast."}
{"text":"Love love this place! Got a number 3 chicken fingers with lemon pepper was delicious. Sweet tea was an added bonus. Will definitely go again"}
{"text":"This review is purely based off of the fact I just made a large order for my office and got nothing but attitude from the woman taking my order. My office orders lunch on several occasions from small local businesses like this one and I have never witnessed someone be so annoyed that we haven't finished our large order yet. The state that broke the camels back was our final co-workers order was preceded with the exclaimed comment of \"oh my gosh ok, is that the last one\". Prior to that, a side note during our order was that if we have a large order, to call ahead of time. Believe me when I say that if I didn't work for a busy office and that the last thing we had to think about two hours before lunch was what and where we were going to eat, we would have. We got to our order for a burger, where she then continued to largely exhale and tell us how small her grill was (we had 45 pieces of grilled chicken on it already and she told us it would take at least 30 minutes) and that now it would take even longer. As if being there and ordering food for at least 10 people wasn't bad enough, we sure as hell weren't going to waste anybody else's time by cancelling a burger order because you warned us of how inadequate your cooking equipment was. I'm sure I could continue with every eye roll and every interruption during our order from this woman, but to make matters worse, yes - I was standing there so long that my sandals were stuck to their disgustingly sticky floor and I could have potentially cracked my ankle. I hope they're glad that I do NOT recommend anyone bragging to a group of people to eat here or else you'll be greeted with frustration. This experience lacked enjoy ability as much for us as I'm sure for her."}
{"text":"It was alright. Fries good but the chicken a bit soggy. Really good sauces. They want to charge 50 cents for every sauce though. I'd go back if I was drunk or really hungry."}
{"text":"I usually enjoy the fried chicken fingers but i opted for the chicken salad today. What a bad decision. The chicken was so dry and overcooked. It was shredded up while they chopped it up. I tried to use ranch to make up for the dry chicken but had no luck. I used one and a half ranch cups on less than half the salad and it was still dry! It had 3 pieces of sliced cucumber and 5 cherry tomatoes atop a bed of chopped romaine lettuce and two pieces of red onion. It was sprinkled with croutons and cheese which was probably the best part.   I had some of my bfs chicken fingers and fries and they were good. That Chicken was dry as well and the batter was soggy. Dipping it in the honey mustard seemed to remedy the problem.   Overall, i recommend ordering ahead so you dont have to wait in line. The dining area is way too small and hot. The fried chicken fingers and fries are good, but i personally prefer Raising Canes any day."}
{"text":"Chicken Shack had some scrumptious chicken fingers. I especially liked the chicken, which was not dry and fairly juicy. They got that right. I just wish the coating was a bit more crispy, but I liked the chicken so much that it wasn't a big deal. It was a bit pricey, but you got a lot of food. There was no way I was going to eat all that in the combo, which came with a ton of fries. The service was friendly and unbelievably fast. It was lunch time and there were a lot of people in line. A few minutes after I placed my order and was getting my drink, a man came out with my food. Wow, I never had food brought out that fast!"}
{"text":"The service was friendly and fast. The fries were perfect and amazingly hot unlike other places. Only issue I ran into was the chicken was a little dry... Other than that it was a good dinner"}
{"text":"Excellent wings and helpful staff. They even gave us advice on which sauces to get and dropped an extra wing or 2 by accident.   The taste was delicious. Highly recommended on your way to Hoover Dam."}
{"text":"Consistent, cooked to juicy perfection, crispy, tons of sauce options, delicious shoestring fries, very generous portions, and your plate will be ready before you get a chance to sit down and pull out your phone. If you're a fried chicken fanatic then this place is where you will find the best bang for your buck as well as your palate. If only there was another location in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great, best fast food available between PHX and Vegas. We always order a burger and 5 fingers and share. Plenty of food, great value, great service and people. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Chicken Shack but do not come to the Rainbow location. We decided to go because we were across town running around doing errands. We all ordered 3 piece wings and 3 fingers combo. The fingers were cooked hot and fresh and the wings were cold like they were prepared earlier and then sauce was added as the orders came in. Or fries were old room temperature fries. I don't understand because I've been to 2 more of their locations and haven't had an issue at all. I brought my dad to show him how good it was but he wasn't impressed and doesn't ever want to try it again. Bummer. The valle verde and sunset location is always busy and has super fresh hot food! They have great customer service at those locations as well. Definitely check out the other locations."}
{"text":"Don't second guess stopping here. The friendly crew running this shack knows what they're doing. The food was nothing short of great and service was right there with it.  Whether it's their wings, burgers, chicken fingers or fries, you won't regret your choice. And their sauces are legendary.  This will definitely be on our pit stops when we come to Vegas from now on. Well worth the drive!"}
{"text":"I LOVE CHICKEN, this location is perfect 2 minutes away from my house instead of having to drive 12-15 min to the other one.  The barbecue chicken strips with the fries are my favorite! They have the best fries , soft, tasty everything you want"}
{"text":"Been looking for a place like this in Vegas for awhile now and this place popped up in my neighborhood. Super clean spot. The prices are great and the service is fast. Pretty sure I've found my new lunch spot! Their honey bbq is my sh#*!! I gotta be careful!!"}
{"text":"Never disappointed whenever I order here, the chicken is fire flame. I always get the chicken fingers with the honey BBQ and honey habanero sauces on the side. Combo comes with fries and a drink and the fries are too good as well!! Just wish had this in California!"}
{"text":"Great food stop along HWY 93 between Hoover Dam and Las Vegas...that is if you are willing to unleash your inner carnivore.  Prices are right, tons of flavors, wings are big and meaty - went with the Jamaican Jerk- and humorous sayings on the wall. Fries were nice and crispy as well. Some indoor seating, but plenty of shaded parking similar to a sonic set up. They'll give you a free sticker and magnet as well."}
{"text":"This location is always busy...and well worth the wait! Not only do they serve deliciously prepared food, they always do it with such warm and friendly service! It's the kind of place you end up leaving with a smile. Eddy, one of the cashiers is pretty much the best at guiding new customers through the menu and suggestions & just great, attentive, & caring overall. Always keeps me coming back!"}
{"text":"Great temperature great flavor great value!  The best skinny fresh tasty French fries ever. The spicy chipotle wings is a must try."}
{"text":"This place is near my place of work so I have ordered from Chicken Shack many times. I always order my food to-go and it's always ready pretty quick and they are consistently delicious! This is kind of a small restaurant so seating is limited here but like I've said, I always get it to-go."}
{"text":"One of the best places to go and enjoy great food.  Service is amazing,  the young crew that runs the shack is awesome.  And the price for great food is good.  I recommend  everyone to come here!"}
{"text":"I guess the main ingredient is salt. This place is horrible. I ordered the chicken fingers and fries. The chicken had no flavor. Thank god they gave me a side of ranch for 49 cents. I don't recommend this salt Shack at all. I will never return. And to top it off, my plate was over $9.00 m"}
{"text":"THE CHICKEN SHACK IS WACK! Frys were hella soggy ' chicken is same as you would get from Albertsons or Vons deli' 40$ down the drain'  I don't see a purpose for chicken shack when you have Canes all over the place that serves good food  for fair prices'"}
{"text":"Omg. Very good wings. Crunchy and very flavorful. I had the honey garlic and creamy garlic Parmesan. So good. I really wanted to go back for more. Didn't want to be greedy"}
{"text":"Tasty Tasty Chicken!!!!!   Just driving through and it sounded good. Very impressed. Much better than Canes or Chick Fil-A   Cool atmosphere and very nice people running it."}
{"text":"I've been hooked on this place for over a year now the service is great and the food is delicious . Chicken shacks is so good makes you wanna slap yo mama !"}
{"text":"Great customer service, horrible wings. Very soggy and salty fries for my first time eating here"}
{"text":"Mmmmm good, first timer here. Staff are friendly and fun. Having the chicken fingers and fries real real good. And the sauces, honey/ habenrro and Jamaican jerk awesome. Must be good food, people just keep coming in. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Exactly what it should be. Fast food chicken fingers and wings with a HUGE choice of dipping sauces.  Overly salty and greasy for me - but the chicken seemed very good quality, and the portions were large.  Tiny place. No ambiance to speak of - other than a wall of \"Why did the chicken cross the road?\" jokes. (some of which were actually pretty cute - but it wears off quickly).   Because of the limited menu, this probably won't be a regular stop for me. But if I'm craving wings or fingers, this is definitely the place."}
{"text":"I've been to Chicken Shack several times now since it's just a quick walk away during lunch time. The food comes out quickly, service is great and its affordable. I've tried a few of their items on the menu.  The chicken tenders are very juicy and come in larger portions. Sometimes they'll even give one extra chicken tender with your meal. The fries....don't get me started. I. love. chicken. shack. fries. Sometimes they can be on the salty side, but they are the thin, shoestring kind and they are always perfectly crispy!! I'll admit...I've gone just for the fries before...(Don't judge me). Don't forget to ask them to toss your chicken in your selected sauce, or else it will come on the side. I've tried about half of their sauces available and all are yummy. You can't go wrong with which ever sauce you choose. I usually get the buffalo and ranch. Their ranch is so good. I've also had their salad for a healthier alternative with grilled chicken. Its not bad for healthy...but if you're going there you might as well indulge and get the fried stuff!  Definitely my go to spot if I'm craving some chicken tenders!"}
{"text":"Great food great service to people really nice the food was really good I want to go back to I'll go back there again and again I hope to use them for more parties and and football games and hockey games in the future you should try this place out it's like the old chicken place is back east"}
{"text":"I should have been smarter then to be fooled by the TV ad for this place.  There is a reason I have driven BY this place for years without stopping.    The young lady who took my order had the charm of a wet mop.  There was no greeting, just a \"what do you want\".  When I said I needed a second to decide, I got an obvious eye-roll, and a slump in her posture.   There was no one behind me in line, but I felt like I was bothering her just by being there.    I had chicken fingers with fries, and a small cup of macaroni salad.  One should be aware going in that EVERYTHING is ala cart.  U don't even get one dipping sauce for the overpriced fingers without paying extra.  Speaking of the chicken fingers ... definitely one of the worst I've ever had.  They were very tough and stringy.  The crust was plain-ass flour!  I don't think the chicken or the breading had ever SEEN any seasoning.  Bland, bland, bland!  That, on top of the chewy chicken made them a ZERO star item for me. The macaroni salad, while WAY overpriced, was pretty descent.  At $2.50 for about 1/2 cup, it should have been good! The tiny cup of honey mustard dipping sauce (which was a 50¢ charge) tasted just like the Kraft dressing of the same flavor. The only thing that was actually good was the order of fries.  ($2.50 for a small).  They were the shoestring type, which I prefer.  They are about one and a half of the 2 stars I gave the place. Would I return?  Only if I was VERY hungry, and everything else was closed."}
{"text":"We were visiting in town and this place was highly rated so we took a shot. SO good, super fairly priced and large portions. This place is legit, the chicken is hand breaded and juicy, and the fries are crispy and on point. We will definitely be back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Food is fresh and flavorful. Service is fast and friendly. I only wish they were a drive through... but no one is perfect, haha! Their ranch dressing is amazing. Yum-o!"}
{"text":"First time there.  Was told  everything is made fresh  there. My order was ready in less than 3 minutes so I questioned it. I was told they blanch them first then finish them off to order. Well that's crap! Makes no sense. They were dry, tough and the breading had no flavor. I bought blue cheese and it was only half full. The chili was small for the price and is mediocre.  Not going back!!!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service I have ever experience arrival at 8:40 and the guy says they are close. How do you run a business that close at 9:pm and say you close at 8:30 pm  every day poor business etiquette if take you 30 mins to clean then make your hours that you stay at work to close 9:30 I travel far to try this but I will come back you can keep it"}
{"text":"Its my new go to place.Dont think I will ever get enough.Fast and all the staff are very, very  friendly.Its also a hometown favorite."}
{"text":"Chicken Shack has the most amazing fried chicken and fries to be found in the Vegas area. I dream of this place, it's that good. People concerned with their health need not bother, come here if you want to assault your arteries with fried chicken greasy wonder and salt. Lots of great sauces, bone-in or boneless, heck they even have a Gardenburger. The fries are splendid. The location is small, the tables are sticky. It's perfect."}
{"text":"Went here for chicken tenders hand tossed with bbq sauce, got slimy somewhat cooked tenders that had bbq sauce poured into Togo box. Returned food I thought it was prett gross"}
{"text":"Tried for the first time and it was really good ! I got 5 Sweet Chili fingers and my boyfriend got the triple shack burger . We really enjoyed it and will be ordering again soon !!!"}
{"text":"Chicken was very good, served hot.  I'm not a fan of their fries... they are shoe string type fries.  Chicken wasn't as juicy as KFC,  but still very good.   Give it a try,  it might work for you."}
{"text":"I feel so morbidly obese for loving Chicken Shack's chicken tenders so much, but I dream about this place when I am back in Los Angeles, the land of many delicacies. I really don't have another chicken restaurant to compare this to since I've never been to Raising Cane's due to the distance, but this place is mouthgasmic enough for me. Chicken Shack is just minutes away from my house, it's cheap, and service is fast, which makes this place a great choice for poor medical students like myself.  The tenders are deep-fried to a crisp, moist, and comes piping hot either drenched in a sauce of your choice or on the side if you so please.  You can also ask for a side of ranch to cool that palette if the sauce is too spicy. The fries taste fresh and definitely beats any fast food chain.   I'd come here every week if I wasn't worried about growing another chin or fucking up my arteries...but alas, I'll limit my attendance to every few months because my hyperactive thyroid is now slowing down and soon, i will have to eat just lettuce to stay alive."}
{"text":"We stopped here on our way back from touring the Hoover Dam. It's a small place with some indoor dining and some outdoor picnic tables. While it doesn't look like much, the food and service are fantastic! Raising Cane's wishes it were this good. They have excellent chicken tenders and an expansive list of sauces for dipping. If you like the sauce at Raising Cane's, try the spicy ranch here. If you're hungry for some great chicken, look no further!"}
{"text":"While on our way to the Hoover dam,  the two teenagers in the back were hungry. They opted for Jack in the Box across the street. My boyfriend saw the Chicken Shack directly across the street and said, we should try it. I thought, hmmm that place looks a little quiet and run down. But hey, we're on vacation lets try something new. We walked in and I was surprised by how cute it was inside. They had license plates from all over the country on the walls and the staff was so friendly. The prices were good. I ordered some chicken strips and fries. My boyfriend ordered the same. Oh. my. gosh! The food is amazing. It was so much food that I couldn't finish it all. The portions are huge,and they also included a bunch of different sauce with your meal.. I cant wait to go back once we're in the Vegas area again. It really is worth stopping by and having a look for yourself."}
{"text":"The chicken fingers and shoestring fries are really good. Some of the best in Las Vegas. I love how they have a large selection of sauces! I love trying different sauces. I recommend you try the Sweet Chili."}
{"text":"Busy little place alongside a noisy highway but the chicken tenders were the best I've ever had and I loved all the variety of sauces. Very friendly staff, fast service and they even gave a piece of chicken to my dog!"}
{"text":"Stop here and give them your business. You WON'T regret it.   Everything that's great about a small town is nestled beautifully init The Chicken Shack.   If you're looking for a comfortable place where you'll be greeted with a smile and warm casual conversation, as well as amazing chicken (and fry sauce), stop here and enjoy the captured comfort of a time near forgotten.   The cashier even offered and gave us a ride to our car (we walked because we thought it was closer to where we parked.   Comfort food meets comfort atmosphere and comfort conversation at The Chicken Shack."}
{"text":"3.5 star because the seasoning on one of my chicken orders was too salty..it tasted like gallon of salt was added to the wings and it was not hot off the fryer when it came out , so three 3.5 stars for now. I did like the fact that it's not greasy and very crunch texture on the outside and moist on the inside. Overall , I would return and try their other flavors and hopefully the chicken is hot off the fryer on my next visit."}
{"text":"Awesome service!!! , delicious french fries, tasty sauces! A really good place to stop by !"}
{"text":"Came in the first time today and just ordered chicken wings with teriyaki sauce the wings were very well then the fries that come with it or in small Cuts so they are nice and crunchy Sharon was our hostess she was very nice the place is very clean atmosphere is very warm great radio station if you love 60s and 70 music I would recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"Don't let the appearance of the building turn you away. That being said, it's not a bad looking building, just not new and shiny. The food here is sooooo good. I had the fingers and fries a few days ago. (Fresh cut big pieces of chicken, hand battered and hot crispy shoestring fries) Today I stopped in because I had to see if the wings were as good. They were beyond good. The batter they dip the wings in before frying had such a unique flavor. Be sure to get your sauce on the side because I didn't even feel like I needed it after my first bite. I got my, frequent clucker card, or whatever they call it and plan to fill it up quickly. Nice job guys (and gal) you are doing a great job there."}
{"text":"This place is a gem! If you like shoe string fries and dank fried chicken then stop in and let your taste buds get their party on wings and fingers were both great. The seasoning was on point and they have a bunch of sauces to choose from. Nice outdoor seating too"}
{"text":"Wow! I consider myself a chicken finger expert and these fingers are LEGIT! Great service, smiling faces, and big sides of ranch! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch on our way back to Vegas from Hoover Damn. Only 15 min from the Damn. Clean and friendly and obviously loved by the locals."}
{"text":"Yummy...omgosh...fries are awesome with mild sauce. The boneless chickens are huge and delicious. Like this place alot. Can't wait for my boyfriend to try and get his input. =]"}
{"text":"Great customer service and even better food! Cute little place to go & the employees always great you and make sure you're welcomed. I love that they come out after and make sure your food is alright. Definitely a must try!! & prices are very reasonable and the food is always fresh to order!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. I've ate Chicken Shack twice now. This is the BEST wing spot in the Vegas/Henderson area PERIOD! Trust me on that. Also the service is great as well. Btw, they are a part of the postmates delivery service so you don't even have to leave your house!"}
{"text":"Welcome Derek and his team to Henderson. Went in there and this place is awesome! The staff is friendly and inviting and greet you with a smile! The food was fresh hot and smells extremely awesome! Come down and support them."}
{"text":"How do I describe the Shack ... hmmmmmm.  Of all the locations, this is the best (speaking of which, they are opening on on Rainbow & Tropicana!  Finally, movin' on up to the West Side).     Chicken is a little salty and greasy at times - BUT, staff is friendly and the chicken is juicy and yummy.  Habanero Honey Sauce - oh and don't forget the Fry Sauce."}
{"text":"We came in and the line was out the door. They took orders crazy fast! We had our order less than 5 minutes from ordering! AMAZING SERVICE! Employees are smiling and happy to be a work. The food is fresh, HOT, and tastes AMAZING!!! I only wish we had one in the SouthWest. We will always return!! Leaving happy and with a full bell!"}
{"text":"Love this place but I really wished that one of their locations were open passed at least 10pm on fridays and Saturday's."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places for Chicken and Burgers.  Best place to eat when headed towards Lake Mead and Hoover Dam.  The staff is very friendly and even let us try the chicken fingers when we ordered burgers.  A class act of a place."}
{"text":"Try this place because it was close to home, and that wasn't my brightest idea. If you like fried everything, I'm sure that this place is the bomb. It's just not for me. The people are nice, the service was good, the place was clean, and there's plenty of convenient parking."}
{"text":"We got our order to go, but the wings were still crispy and juicy. The fries (strings) were ok, my partner in crime told me they used to have thicker fries and wondered why we had strings this time. Doesn't matter the wings and company made up for it."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. It's small inside. The chicken strips are not just chicken strips they are chicken tenderloins. Service was super fast and super friendly. If you are ever driving by and are craving some fried chicken this is the place to stop. Next time I will be trying the wings."}
{"text":"Great local flavor restaurant. The chicken was fresh and not the already prepared variety. Better than any chain choice of Buffalo Wild Wings or Hooters types! Will visit again when in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing chicken here! Also, their thin shoestring fries are to die for delicious. This place was one of the hardest things to leave behind when going off to college. Not only is this nice family owned and operated business tasty, but it also has quick and friendly customer service to boot. If you have never been here before you will certainly not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great chicken after checking out Hoover Dam. Great sauces and fries too.  I did not think a chicken finger could cause me to write a review, but I was wrong."}
{"text":"This is place is mediocre at best in my book.  I felt that the chicken fingers were rubbery (probably from being overcooked).  Also, the fries were too salty.  Why do places put any salt on fries?  I can put salt on fries, and as much as I want!  I was hungry, so I ate it anyway, but I'll never go back to this place.  Also, charging for the dipping sauce?  Really?  Can't you just include it in the already high prices?  Just go to Chick-fil-a, they have better chicken strips and don't charge you extra for some freaking ranch!"}
{"text":"Have been to this place several times and have not been disappointed. I've tried several of the sauces and each one has been flavorful and the portion sizes are more than enough. I get the 3 piece tender meal and more often than not get 4 tenders, so I'm assuming it's done by weight and not just a number. The counter attendants are extremely nice and courteous, even when it's busy.   While true, sometimes the some of tenders can be a little dry, it's not something that ruins the meal and everything else far outweighs this issue. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This business has been open for about less than a week, we've been waiting for it to be open so patiently, but now it's here and we can rejoice!  I love chicken shack, I love everything about it, the food, the service, the location.  Food is awesome as usual, there were some new tech equipment they were using, which I thought was an amazing feature.  The food was more delayed than I would like it, but in all honesty they've been open for a week, it takes time to get to that awesome status, which is why a star is missing.  I know I'll be rewriting this eventually with five stars and hearts everywhere, but for now the kinks need to be sorted out with that.  Actually all my stars really go to the service.  There were hiccups and delays, but Jamie was so sweet and apologetic, she was able to help me carry my order because I had my infant, and let me know why it was delayed with great explanation.  That alone, is what makes this place have a minimum of three stars.  Customer service is such a big part of this industry, it can make someone smile to having the most infuriating person ever.  Jamie was so amazing and if all the employees are as sincere as she is, then there's no doubt this location will be the best!"}
{"text":"Best customer service in town! Told him it was my first time at his restaurant and he took care of me real well. BEST FINGERS IN TOWN!"}
{"text":"Love this place great staff and food. The only reason I give it 4 instead of 5 is its just so small and crowded and when it's busy that line takes forever to move being only one register, however food always comes out rather fast."}
{"text":"So I love Chicken Shack it's probably my favorite place to eat. I was so happy to see the opened a second location in Henderson. Let me say this new location is so slow I called my order in at 7:56pm they said 10 minutes so I got there at 8:07 pm I figured it would either be ready or close to by time. I paid and took a seat, I sat there for 20 minutes waiting for my food and when it was finally ready they brought it to me with no apology for my wait. Here's the kicker, I get in my car and decide to grab a couple fries and they're total soggy. I guess I'll stick to the location I know best the one on sunset and mt vista -__-"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Chicken sandwich is great. Sides are great also like the potato salad"}
{"text":"Simply put, the best chicken fingers I've ever had.   Beats Canes by FAR!   Great service and fresh food - came in 10 minutes before close and they were so pipping hot and delicious."}
{"text":"Sorry Yelp fam it's been 2 weeks since I've been to check this place out and here is what I think. The service there/here is very friendly and they take really good care of you. If you want to know where all your cox workers are well come have lunch and you will see lol. We arrived about 11:00-11:30 and it wasn't packed just a few ppl but in 30 minutes this places filled up and it was a Saturday. Ok ok let's rate the food the chicken was ok nothing I was in awe about it satisfies your craving though if you're having one. I will be back I think maybe I didn't order right maybe I will try a different flavor. The fries were yummy but what I loved best was the bacon cheese burger we order.....go figure right but it was hella good! Well that's all I have for now but the experience and food were good you should go check them out"}
{"text":"Bomb! Best chili cheese fries I've had in forever. I had the honey habanero sauce and it was pretty tasty. Not the cheapest and they charge you extra for ranch and stuff, but that's okay. My new go to for wings."}
{"text":"Food was memorable in that I wasn't impressed. Our chicken fingers were soggy and the breading didn't stick at all. Staff was nice and super helpful but I just wasn't impressed with the food."}
{"text":"I love wings and they are the best I've ever had. Got five sauces which were all delicious (They have many more than that), but I also like breaded wings without sauce. The crunchy breading had a great taste all by itself and the chicken underneath is juicy and the pieces were all good size. I will definitely be going back to the Chicken Shack in Boulder City. The guys there were really nice too!"}
{"text":"the chicken wings and strips were just awsome.  string fries were crisp and crunchy. only down side was i upgraded for the chilli cheese fries. my personal recommendation is you can pass. but grab the 3 and 3 combo. its great. it was a bit pricier than i had expected but i didnt mind after tasting the food. if you in the mood for a quick fresh fried chicken make sure you stop by."}
{"text":"I really love this place, but I have a hard time giving them 5 stars when we go at 9pm on Tuesday and they're closed. The sign says they're open until 10pm. What gives? It's making it very hard for me to consistently go there and we average at least once a week. If your sign says you're open until 10. Stay open until 10. Jerk your customers around and they won't come back."}
{"text":"Had my eye on this place and was happy when I had a chance to sample it's delights.  Upon entry I noticed the it is close quarters ordering and eating.  I suggest either an early or a late lunch.  This place gets busy!  And rightfully so I might add.  I ordered up five tenders and fries with a sweet tea.  Some tenders were coated with habanero honey and some were dusted with the garlic parmesan seasoning.  For dipping I chose both ranch and bleu cheese.  Fully expecting the habanero to hurt me, it did not and was not overpowering but offering a very nice spicy/sweet taste.  I did not notice the parmagarlic rub to much.  No matter, the chicken was moist and tasty.   FYI...They serve beer."}
{"text":"Great fries, but expected the chicken to be better.  It is not bad chicken...but for the price, they should be phenomenal."}
{"text":"Chicken Shack has hit the west side, just in time to be my go-to takeout order for football season! With their ridiculously awesome selection of over 25 sauces, there's a flavor for everyone, whether you're looking to dip your wings, chicken, or fries. The friendly young staff and vaguely southern decor with corrugated metal and license plates almost trick me into thinking I'm back at Plucker's wing bar in San Marcos, Texas. Short of a plane ride, this is as close as I can get, and that's a huge compliment.  All the chicken orders are made fresh with never-frozen chicken, and their batter is in that Goldilocks area of being neither too thick or too thin. Menu also has salads and a handful of sandwiches and sides, but you come here for the chicken. The huge, meaty tenders are my preferred piece but if it's Wednesday, you'll catch me cleaning their wings down to the bone. Combo portions are as big as the wide-open hill country sky, with SIX wings, FIVE tenders, or the half-and-half option, any which can easily make two small lunches.   My favorite sauces are spicy honey garlic (gotta love those little bits of garlic!), Jamaican Jerk (slow, building heat), the creamy garlic parm (cheesy and cooling), and the spicy bleu cheese (for the best of both worlds)- I always get sauces on the side so I can dip, otherwise they'll toss your order, so be sure to specify!"}
{"text":"Great chicken but greasy! They even throw in 1 or 2 pieces extra depending on how large of a fingers order you get. Kinda of irriatating to have to pay extra for some of the sauces though since they aren't included in their reguilar sauce list. And then they don't even fill the containers more than half full when you've paid extra for them. I suppose when I am in the mood for chicken & in the nieghborhood I might stop in again."}
{"text":"Heard good things but was totally disappointed chicken came out burnt fries were cold and the server acted like he/she (couldn't tell) didn't care about their job at all! Will not be going back!!!"}
{"text":"We just had the chicken finger and chicken sandwiches with fries. The fries were done well crispy and salted just right, the chicken fingers had a light coating on them and was good quality lean chicken, the bread and sandwich ingredients were all fresh. The place looks like an old fashioned bell hop type of drive in from the 50's, it had 4 picnic tables under the shaded area in front of the restaurant, a perfect place to sit on a nice day, it had about 8-12 tables inside also. Best chicken fingers I have had so far in and around Vegas."}
{"text":"Decent at best, the breading was soft and so were the fries, the whole meal seemed a little oily compared to the Chicken Shack  in Boulder  The Chicken Shack in Boulder is way better, they make a crisper, less oily chicken finger and crisp well done fries. Also Raising Canes on Las Vegas BLVD is better."}
{"text":"When I arrived at Chicken Shack, I asked the cashier to help me with my discount on my phone. Although it was on the site, we couldn't make it work. So he went to his manager & they gave me my discount anyway. I ordered the 3 piece tender combo. The chicken was perfectly fried & tender & I really enjoy the way they make their French fries."}
{"text":"I called and ordered dinner to go. 5 piece chicken fingers and a single bacon burger with cheese.  As soon as I walked in I was greeted by the friendly staff. Food was fresh with great flavor. Exactly what I was craving."}
{"text":"This place is the best. I'd recommend over canes. They hand batter the chicken to order so it's always fresh. The fries are made in butter so they're super buttery and delicious and crispy. Everything is made fresh to order. Every time we've gone we've never been disappointed. The customer service is always pretty great and their sauces are all homemade and super tasty. The only downside are the drinks because their soda machine isn't the best. The chicken wings and fingers are pretty huge compared to like bww or canes or any other place. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Shack attack!   From the first time we set foot in Chicken Shack to the present, it's been our favorite place for wings.  I have a catch phrase of 'Shack Sunday' because we always come here to get our wings during football season.  They open at 10 so it's perfect for game time. They are located off of Sunset in the Smiths shopping plaza so it's easy to find with ample parking.    Now let's get down to business- the wings here have stayed consistently huge, succulent and flavorful.  They offer a huge variety of sauces for the wings.  All are great.  The hot sauce and the honey habanero are our favorites.  You can choose to have them tossed in the sauce or on the side.  Tip- if you're carrying out, get the sauce on the side and toss them yourself when you get home.   I hate to leave out mentioning the over addicting shoestring fries.  They do not skimp on these tasty sides.  The BBQ baked beans are also a favorite of mine. It's always a tough choice of mine which side to get.    Customer service is reliably top notch. They treat us like one of their friends every time.  They are always friendly and make a point to say hi even during a busy time.  I always appreciate their kindness as well as the amazing food.    Any day is always a great day for wings!"}
{"text":"The fried chicken is cheap.  That's the attraction and why this place is busy, even at ten in the morning. It's better than the fast food places for sure.   Latest visit the place already looked trashed, sticky floors, the floors around soda dispenser area was wet.  Come on, they just opened? I was hesitant on ordering chicken because if front of house is a hot mess what about the kitchen? Went against my better judgment and ordered my combo meal from the surly cashier.  Well now I remember why we don't come here so often.  Some pieces were good, some salty, most pieces dry.  Ended up with upset stomach even though I ended throwing most of my meal. Sigh.  So this update is more a note to myself why we pass on this place."}
{"text":"My chicken tenders were dry and the breading came off all of them as I tried picking them up. What else might be left to add?   The restaurant is small & cute and they have great side sauces like ranch and honey mustard along with many other options but I like eating food that tastes fresh and delicious. The skinny fries are ok but didn't do it for me either. I found my fries to be incredibly salty.   I think that if you make one thing you should make it really well.   I also think other similar chains offer better quality of food and lower prices. The end."}
{"text":"Food = great! The people = great.  We go there all the time! Sooo good Fries = yum Cannot go wrong !"}
{"text":"Sooo bomb. I got the 3 finger combo & had them put the mild sauce over the fingers, SHIT. The mild was kinda spicy but sweet at the same time. The fries were kinda salty but tasted good with the ranch. Speaking of the ranch, they have really good ranch. The ranch says a lot to me about the quality of the place. My boyfriend got the 5 piece finger with hot bbq over them. Reminded me of Buffalo Wild Wings honey bbq boneless wings, but better. S"}
{"text":"Tasty wings & strips. The wife variety of sauces was awesome. Came on a Sunday, the gal at the front was really nice."}
{"text":"I always get the #3 combo, which includes 3 pieces of chicken, fries and a safe. You can get the chicken tied in the sauce, but I find that they get soggy quicky. Chicken is most and tender. I love the Jamaican jerk sauce and their ranch!"}
{"text":"I prefer coming to this newest location of The Chicken Shack. Located in the strip mall anchored by Kohls, it's by a residential area, less traffic to deal with, right off the 215 Valle Verde exit. It's cleaner and kept clean, unlike the other Henderson location which I reviewed in the past.  The meal combos are good deals. My go to is #1 Combo.. 6pc wings, heap of skinny fries(or veggies on request) and a drink. Just under ten bucks!  Favorite sauce/topping: It's a garlic parmesan, but the dry rub version, tossed. Not on the menu, so you have to request it..or point to my photo. The owner, V..?, told me she makes the sauces every morning. I haven't got around to trying any other sauces, just the garlic/parm one, 3 different ways..lol..So you got a favorite, I want to hear about it, maybe I'll change up my orders.  The chicken ..good.. nice size, meaty..but not the best. But for the price, I'll go for it. There was one time I came and it was a tad dry, another time under seasoned.  The employees, owner or staff in charge do make the rounds to those dining in and will ask how is everything and are eager to please their customers.  Dining area is clean, same furnishings left from previous restaurant are still here,,,makes me miss BBD now..sniff sniff.  The wall is decorated with those corny \"Why Did The Chicken Cross the Road\" jokes and license plates. I spotted one from the Phillipines!  It's busy from the start at 10am and seating fills up fast. This particular franchise is separate from Sunset and Boulder City locations, different owner/operator. The staff is really nice and friendly and make it a point to remember their regulars, an overall good neighborhood vibe and place to get wings!"}
{"text":"First time @ this place. It was packed which seems to be a good sign, I ordered the chicken fingers, and really wasn't impressed. I had heard alot of good things from others, which led me to try it, but I wasn't excited about it. Needs more sauce as they seemed dry... Not bad, but not great."}
{"text":"It was my first time! I came with my boyfriend and our 2 girls and it was amazing!!! I definitely will come back, maybe even this week lol! The customer service alone, without even trying the food yet was outstanding. The food just topped it off. :)"}
{"text":"They have awesome chicken fingers.  My favorite is creamy garlic Parmesan.  It gets pretty busy so we always call & order first then go pick it up.  I would recommended to everybody."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. the only reason it gets 4 instead of 5 is because the place is super small, and when it's busy sometimes all the tables are full. I love their fingers and fries! Everything is cooked fresh and hot, and their sauces are amazing too. They have so many different types to choose from. My favorite is the chili lime sauce and regular hot sauce. The service was great too, they called us by name, and every employee had a smile on their face. Definitely returning."}
{"text":"I have been a loyal customer of the Sunset location since we moved to town.  Now that it's minutes from my home, that was a cherry on top!  What do we want? WINGS!  When do we want them? NOW!  With the amazing service, that is exactly what you get.   Delicious big and juicy wings delivered to your table quick!  What I love almost more than their wings are their fries.  Addicting and abundant.  I believe our baskets were overflowing with so many fries.  Our To-Go orders have been the same.  They surely do not skimp on them and it's totally worth every bite.    I was happy to taste the same great consistency as the original location.   This 'Shack Sunday' girl will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. My friends and I got the 4 person deal. We got 25 wings, a gigantic basket of fries, 4 sodas, and 1 lb of potato salad. The wings were huge and they were very tasty. We had different opinions of what flavors to get, but we were happy with our choices. This is definitely recommended and we will come back to eat the \"all you can eat wings\"."}
{"text":"Had another craving for good chicken wings...thought I'd update my thoughts.  There's something about the batter on the chicken pieces that makes it taste so good...it's also spattered all over the fries.  It's just a nice, greasy, deliciously unnutritious meal.  I have to slightly recommend the wings over the fingers though, as the fingers are a little thick and dry.  I tried the BBQ and mild sauces this time, and the mild was nasty.  I'm not a hot wing guy, so I'd definitely recommend sticking with the honey BBQ or teriyaki sauces if you're anything like me.  TIP: The fingers taste better if you let them marinate for a few minutes in the styrofoam \"to go\" box on the way home...a lot juicier and tastier than dining in."}
{"text":"Fries were pretty tasty and I like the variety of sauces that they offer. I got chicken tenders and they were nothing special. I probably would have been better off getting the wings. I liked the atmosphere of the shop though."}
{"text":"This is my favorite chicken fingers place, huge chicken portions and the best fries I've ever had. Friendly service and loved the 70s classic rock music . They have a lot of great sauces to choose from I try new one every time I come in."}
{"text":"We were in town for Sema and met up with a bunch of people here one evening last week...great food and customer service!"}
{"text":"CHICKEN SHACK IS AMAZING ! Great customer service , awesome management and overall 20/10 on the food !!!! Great prices and a easily accessible location as well !"}
{"text":"After living in Vegas for a year, I'm used to going to places with high ratings/reviews and being underwhelmed. This place lived up to the hype! Large, meaty wings in great sauces, with surprisingly tasty shoestring fries- and I don't even like the shoestring cut! Service was also surprisingly friendly and prompt, so don't let the location and exterior fool you.  The #4 combo is the way to go for a little of everything: 3 wings, 3 strips, fries, a drink (fountain), and toss in bleu cheese or ranch for just under fifty cents extra. Your total is under $10 and it's enough to stuff you to the gills or share (though for dinner I'd add on an extra 6-piece).  Habanero honey and jamaican jerk are really tasty sauces- as my BF said, I'd buy these bottled if they were available! The bleu cheese dressing tastes homemade, which makes paying extra for it a little less annoying.  Wish they had more than one location- I think they'd do well on the West side (hint, hint)."}
{"text":"I used to work at Sunset Park for Clark County. So, I've been to the chicken \"shack\" since it was Chicken Bonz.  The blonde lady who runs the register has been there since I remember. She really didn't smile, or seem to have any personality at all. I remember ordering chicken tenders in habenero honey to go, with fries. The meal that I got was six pieces of chicken, and included a drink. Somehow, this ends up close to $11.  $11...? That's like charging me a dollar for every piece of chicken. Then charging $2 for a handful of fries, and then $2 for a drink, plus tax. I just think that's a little steep.  I get home, and I didn't have tenders, I had wings...and they are wimpyyyyyy!!!  The sauce was good, and so were the fries. I just think that the prices are steep, and the feeling of the store isn't very welcoming."}
{"text":"I've only had their chicken to go and was ok fried chicken.  We had strips and wings.  Their fries were soggy by the time we got them home and to be expected in a Styrofoam container.  We tried them twice.  The second time felt undercooked.  The flavor was good and the fries are better if you heat in oven after getting home.  There's a reason the fast food places put fries in open paper container ;)"}
{"text":"Their chicken is the best!!! The flavor and it's so tender! The correct amount of breading on it. The sauces are amazing!"}
{"text":"so I think they need to change the oil more frequently.....my last 3 times the chicken has been burnt due to bad grease. Not sure what's going on with them never had this problem until lately.  Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly. I had the Sweet Chili wings with their Spicy Blue Cheese, fries, and baked beans. The wings were perfect and the spicy blue cheese had plenty of kick. The baked beans were fabulous."}
{"text":"Amazing, the flavor a was all there the chicken wings are incredibly huge (bigger than bww)  The only thing is seating capacity. It gets so busy during lunchtime that most people order Togo because there are only like 8 tables inside.  You know it's good when it's always busy! I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This place rocks!  We stopped for lunch. The folks are friendly and the place is clean, bright and cheerful.  The chicken was juicy and potions of an unbelievable size.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Had an unfortunate experience when I was given another customers order to go. They caught me outside and explained their mistake and quickly corrected it. They continuously apologized and gave me a free meal card on top of it. My chicken wings were fabulous."}
{"text":"Alright, when you walk in, the first thing you see is all these license plates which makes me think, \"This is about to be some good a$$ chicken.\" I go over to the counter and order that 3 piece and a drink. I get my drink and these dudes go ahead give me an extra chicken. You know what that is? That's Kobe in the 4th. CLUTCH."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price. The staff was incredible! We were headed to lake mead and Hoover dam. Seen this on Yelp and gave it a try. We will go again if in area"}
{"text":"The Chicken Shack, not to be mistaken for Chicken Bonz. Although almost everything taste the same.  You may think 6 wings, fries, ranch and a drink for $9.12 is pricey, think again. These wings are huge and they give a generous amount of fries.  I recommend getting the 3 fingers and 3 wings combo, way worth it, the fingers are huge pieces of juicy breast meat.  They also have an AYCE special going on all day everyday for $11.95 ($1 dollar cheaper than chicken bonz).  I still have yet to try it.  They also have $1 drafts!  As for the inside, it's small and it's maintained pretty well, they got two TV's hanging on the wall, two arcade machines and limited seating on the inside, but there's a couple tables on the outside too.  Overall, flavor and quantity is what Chicken Shack has.  That's really all you need for a good place to eat right?"}
{"text":"What can I say.. I love Chicken Shack! The finger, the sauce, the fries. So stinkin' good. The staff is awesome. Great prices."}
{"text":"Great, quick service! The fries are well done and are the perfect ratio from crispy to chewy. The medium sauce is a good balance between spicy and sweet."}
{"text":"I really loved the French Fries. Very thin and crispy.  My husband and children got wings and we got an order of fingers. The fingers didn't get eaten like I thought they would but everyone loved the wings. Next time I'll just get way more fries and pass on the fingers.  The place was pretty busy ( which I consider to be a good sign). It took about 15-20 for my Togo order to be ready."}
{"text":"I've been going there for many years. We usually go in a group when we go. I usually order the chicken fingers and fries. Their portions are generous and the food is good."}
{"text":"I ordered 3 shack burger meals, 1 with cheese, tomato and pickle, 1 with just cheese, and one plain.  In addition to 12 wings with the sweet chili sauce \"tossed ON\" the wings. What I received was 2 burgers with everything but cheese and 1 with everything including cheese. The fries were cold and my wings wasn't covered in sauce. Instead they put 2 little sauce cups on the side. Lastly, with the shack burger meals came with 3 drinks. I only received 2. The couple times I've been to CS I loved it. Hence why I'm very disappointed."}
{"text":"Whoever answered the phone when I called just now has no customer service skills. He was super short and unfriendly when answering my question. Will not be going to that location today or anytime in the future."}
{"text":"So after everybody claiming this place is great, I finally went and boy was I disappointed. The chicken was chewy and greasy. The sauces were not good. The ranch dressing was though. The fries were disgusting, oily and cold.  We also purchased wings and those were nasty as well. Don't do what I did and believed people that this place was so great and then expect great, because you will want to slap yourself for believing this. People are easily impressed with anything they don't cook. Maybe that's the problem, they should cook.   Don't waste your money. To top it off it is pretty expensive for the quality of food. Don't do it.  Unless you like wasting money.  :)"}
{"text":"Its pretty bomb.  A little dive but man can they cook chicken.  They also have pitchers of beer.  It's pretty great sitting outside eating wings and drinking beer.  Small and cozy.  Jerked and hot teriyaki are my favorites bone in or out doesn't matter, along with some Alaskan Amber beer.  Yummy."}
{"text":"Good place for chicken fingers. The fries could use some work.. very skinny and greasy and overall seems like a very cheap fry. But as far as the chicken fingers.. pretty good."}
{"text":"The best chicken fingers I've ever had, by far.  Better be really hungry if you order the 5 piece cause they're big!  Owners are friendly and welcoming!  They even brought some grilled chicken out to the car for our 3 dogs. Maybe I've lived in Vegas too long but when you come across friendly people like them, it's refreshing and makes you want to come back. The neighboring business blocks/ distracts view of their signage and we had to flip around in busy Saturday traffic....but it was well worth it.. Thanks Chicken Shack!"}
{"text":"I love the food here! the first time I came here there was a kind young gentleman that assisted us at the register and his hospitality alone made me recommend this spot to all my friends and family. I returned again on Labor Day and the lady that is mentioned numerous times on their Yelp page helped me. she is completely rude but had no problem sucking the tv reporters butt that was in their establishment. because of her attitude I don't think I can support this eatery any more. way to make your customers feel like shit"}
{"text":"All I have to say is that if you are ever heading to The Hoover Dam and pass through Boulder City and have a hankering for some Humongous Crispy Juicy Chicken Fingers or perhaps done Chicken Wings, then you better make sure you make a Pit Stop here at The Chicken Shack or else you'll be sorry.   After eating the Chicken Fingers here at The Chicken Shack, the bar has been set so high I don't think I'll ever eat any Chicken Fingers like I've eaten here.   The Chicken Fingers here are so juicy and cooked to perfection with that perfect crunch, i was in Chicken Heaven.   As for the Chicken Wings, it would've been perfect without being tossed in the sauce because I'm a savory type of guy and it was a tad bit too sweet for me but still good nonetheless.   But the star of the show are those Chicken Fingers. It really left a lasting impression on me. Because this may be the only chance I'll ever eat here, I also had the Chili and it was so savory and full of meat. I loved the addition of Sour Cream and Jalapeño's on it as well.   And make sure you use the Bathroom even though you don't have to and you'll get a kick out of it.   I'm still thinking about those Chicken Fingers even when I'm in Hawaii...."}
{"text":"Looks a little sketchy from first glance but the food is outstanding! Staff is great and attentive. Bathrooms are super clean! Prices are very fair. A really fun experience! You have to use a rubber chicken to access the bathroom! That was a fun little side bar. I would absolutely eat here again a snd recommend to anyone looking for a unique experience with great food!!"}
{"text":"So many sauces, so little time! There's a truly huge selection of sauces for tossing or dipping your wings, strips, and fries, so you can change up your order every time. Some of my favorites are the Jamaican Jerk, Hot Honey Garlic, and Creamy Garlic Parm. They also offer spicy versions of their house-made ranch and blue cheese dressings, to kick things up a level.  This location recently opened and is clear across town from me, but has been consistently clean with friendly staff across a couple of visits. I prefer the huge, meaty fingers over the crispy, juicy wings, but they also offer salads, sandwiches, burgers, and a surprisingly good bowl of chili. My go-to is the #4 combo (wings and fingers) with their skinny, salty fries to complement the spicy sauces I get.   TIP: Order online through the Yelp app so you can grab on the go!"}
{"text":"So happy I found this place on yelp. We were driving back to Phoenix from Las Vegas. We got our food super fast and it was so good. They give large portions and even allowed us to try one of famous tenders. I got the lemon pepper wings. I don't have any complaints. I can't wait to come back! We will def. stop by again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely some of the best chicken I've ever had. So flavorful even with out the sauce which is very important when it coomes to chicken, because most chicken eateries the chicken is very bland and this chicken hands down tops all chickens joints rasing canes wing just STOP ain't nothing on THE CHICKEN SHACK puts them to shame. If they ever decide to move it down to LA they would make a killing....can't wait to go back so I have some on our road trip home"}
{"text":"7:29 for 6 wings isn't especially cheap. On average good wings should be about a buck each. Also the fingers are good but way salty and the ranch dressing is very thin.  Fries are pretty good shoestring fries and tasty but again very salty. With all the positive reviews I'd hoped for better. Inside it seats about 20 essentially it's a sonic drive up but no car hop service must walk in."}
{"text":"Another update...  went back to the shack again. This time it was busy. It was also a holiday. New guy at the register, had no idea what he was doing, but he was trying.  This time the food was good. Trip #1 good food good service. Trip #2 eh food and eh service. Trip #3 good food and eh service. \"I'll be back.\""}
{"text":"The chicken is really good and so are the fries. It's too bad because this place is pretty gross inside. Food all over the floors, sticky table tops, a single trash can that looks like it's been there since they opened the place. Woman wearing a backwards ball cap at the register is super rude, I've been brought here by some friends a couple of times and she's always been working. She's very short and makes you feel stupid if you can't hear what she says as she mumbles questions to you. You can tell she doesn't want to be there as you compete for her attention with her cell phone.   Bottom line the food is great. But I don't think it's worth the bad customer service, and I mean it's a chicken place, it's not that hard to take an order. It's so dirty in there too. They have other locations so just go there instead of this one.   **Update** they have a new team and have cleaned the place up. It's perfect."}
{"text":"I went here ever so eager. My eyes went wide at the menu - so many possibilities and so many sauces to try.  I opted for the standard wings. And went with trying 4 of the sauces - hot, damn hot, chili lime, and habanero honey. Blue cheese and ranch for dipping. Also ordered fries with fry sauce and potato salad.  The wings themselves are nice and plump. Very good quality. And the wings are actually breaded, which can be hard to do well. But the breading was nice and crisp and had a good flavor. So all is good with the actual wings.  The sauces, though, are lacking. The hot was actually more like a mild. Zero heat and little flavor. The chili lime was similar. I could barely tell it was chili lime there was so little flavor. The habanero honey also had zero heat and was too sweet. The damn hot, however, was fabulous. It had heat and flavor, but wasn't hot just for the sake of being hot. So, with the exception of the damn hot (which is the hottest on their menu), if you don't like heat or lots of flavor in your wing sauce, this might be the place for you. This is where they lose major points. The sauce is the most crucial part of the wings.  The blue cheese and ranch were ok, but not great. They didn't add anything to the wings. They're just sorta there.  The fries are really good. They are shoestring fries that are crispy and non-greasy. The fry sauce was just average. They do also offer chili cheese fries.  The potato salad was edible. And that's pretty much the best I can say about it.  Good service. Props for the $1 drafts and all you can eat wings.  Overall, if they could just get some better wing sauces (or my taste buds suddenly deteriorate), I might be back."}
{"text":"The chicken fingers are amazing. Best in town. Thick and full, not like raising canes nasty full of bread and no chicken. Great customer service, will definitely be there at least once a week."}
{"text":"Ordered the # 2 combo, medium heat.  Overall it was really good, great value.  The chicken fingers were perfect, no \"questionable\" bites.  The fries were addicting - I kept eating and eating and eating them, even after I was full.  The only comment I have is that the chicken fingers looked like sauce was dumped on them, I'd rather have them tossed in sauce so the sauce covers 100% of the chicken.  Other than that it was a great meal, I will be back for lunch again!"}
{"text":"Great prices and great food. the wings and legs are large sized so dont order too much."}
{"text":"Great chicken and adorable owners. What a difference between typical fast food and the gourmet chicken here. I have had better coleslaw, but I am not really going there for the sides."}
{"text":"The chicken strips were good, the fries OK, and the sauces as advertised.  The lettuce in the salad was edible, but not fresh."}
{"text":"I love this place. The chicken is always juicy and done to perfection and the fries are always hot! The Boulder City location is great too and so is Valle Verde. The new location on St Rose needs more than a little help, but I'm sure it'll soon come up to the standard of the rest!"}
{"text":"My family used to go there a lot. We generally got decent food for what it was. Recently bought dinner and it was disgusting. It was soggy, under sauced, and tasted old and terrible. We called to let them know that night. They on their own offered to replace it, but the next day when we called in asking if we can pick up our replacement, they were very rude. Acting like we were trying to steal food, when they were the ones who offered. They talked back to us..argued with us, just all around acted terrible. They finally said they'd replace a small portion of the terrible old chicken they sold us. We said never mind.  My sister didn't think the food would be safe for her kids, that they might do something to it, because the people acted so underhanded and trashy. I wouldn't have guessed, from having gone in there that they would be so low.   If you like this restaurant, I'd go to a different location!"}
{"text":"So happy that this location opened. Their menu is simple, the wings, fingers, and fries are perfection. The sauces are exceptional. As a transplanted Upstate NYer, I can honestly say this is my new favorite place for my Buffalo Wing and Blue cheese fix."}
{"text":"Love love this place! Excellent chicken and service..we are regulars and love garlic parmesan and honey bbq. The chicken is juicy and tender"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! The Chicken Shack is now my go to spot for some bomb fried chicken!"}
{"text":"So. Good. Super friendly staff and a ton of delicious dips to choose from. I always get the chicken fingers and fries and am never disappointed. Do recommend!"}
{"text":"Such a great casual atmosphere. Huge portions at a great price! Pitcher of beer only $8. So great with the greasy chicken and fries!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious! I came out to Las Vegas for vacation but also visit a good friend. He would always check in on Facebook at The Chicken Shack. I told him he will need to take me there for lunch. The best idea we both had. The chicken fingers were flavorful, juicy, and delicious. I had honey BBQ, the sauce was very light and flavorful. I will come back whenever I visit again."}
{"text":"Chicken Shack is a top-3 restaurant in Henderson for me. I work across the street and regularly walk to eat here for lunch. Their chicken tenders are the best I've had in Henderson, and their skinny fries are the perfectly crispy complement to the tenders. The best part of eating here is the occasional 4th tender they give you when you order a 3-piece meal. They have great sauces, and one of my favorite requests is to have the tenders thrown in medium sauce. For the days when you need a somewhat healthier meal, their grilled chicken salad is filling and somewhat satisfying. The only issue with eating at chicken shack is the limited seating."}
{"text":"Unbelievable.  You will not be disappointed.  In my opinion the chicken fingers are the best choice. That way you get to sample the sauces."}
{"text":"Absoulty the best wings I've had in Las Vegas.   Went early in the morning for chicken and waffles.   Well priced, 4 wings and the perfect waffle.     Recommend if your in Henderson and hungry stop by.  The wings reminded me of what the originals hooters wings used to be like.   Fresh, crunchy and cooked perfectly.   The spicy ranch sauce whoever made that up deserves a raise.   Check it out."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The chicken is so good that you don't even need sauce but you want it!  Every sauce I have tried is good but I love the medium!  Lemon pepper rub is also good.  Portions are really good sized and most times when I ask for extra fingers, they give me more than I ask for for free!  The fingers are the way to go although you also can't go wrong with the wings.  Better than canes or any other chicken place around."}
{"text":"This place is bomb!  I can't say how much I love it.  I was extremely happy when it moved closer to my house and literally 2 minutes from my work.  I may just become obese because of it but that would be ok because it is that good!  Easily the best fingers in town with the best sauces!  The medium and Cajun are where it's at and their ranch is great, which is odd because I've always hated ranch before I tried theirs.  Go here.  The staff are friendly although it did take them a little bit to figure out the register and gift card system but it's fairly new so I'm giving them a break."}
{"text":"A friend told me about this place. Small little quaint restaurant, but dont let the outside fool you. If chicken is what your really craving, I'd come to this place any day over buffalo wild winsg.  The wings are twice the size of buffalo wild wings. Sounds like a bold statement but u gotta try it and you'll know what i mean."}
{"text":"The food is awesome and the employees are very nice.   The chicken wings are the best I've tasted in years.  I ordered a 12 piece and it was way more than i could eat. Excellent fries too!"}
{"text":"Best chicken strips I've had! Large juicy pieces that are breaded to perfection. Light, flakey, and crispy on the outside.  Wings were okay, 2.5 stars. Over breaded and light on the sauce. Stick to the chicken strips."}
{"text":"This place doesn't look like much but the chicken fingers are OUT OF THIS WORLD! Fries were great too - and the guys who work there were super quick and sweet, we loved our dinner and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Their chicken is on steroids!     I was thinking about getting the All You Can Eat special for $11.99 but I was stuffed after 5 wings. I tried the BBQ, Habanero Honey, and Garlic Parmesean. I think the Habanero Honey stood out the most and it's probably my favorite flavor there. I also got a side of cole slaw which tasted like KFC's (which I personally like). I also got a side of fries but it wasn't memorable and it didn't enhance the meal. Hence, I would probably opt out. As much as I like getting a bang for the buck, the unnatural plumpness of the chicken was bit disturbing. Though, I enjoyed the meal the breading was a little bit too thick. If they would refine the breading, I'd give them 3.5 stars for great price and the Habanero Honey flavor."}
{"text":"One word....DELICIOUS!! I showed up to the restaurant around 6 PM and the place was fully crowded. I knew that was a good sign. I am glad I called in my order because they were packed! The chicken was juicy and crispy and the chili cheese fries were amazing. Can't wait to come back here!"}
{"text":"Awesome wings and even the fries are good!!!!! Needed a place to stop on the way to Vegas and this was such a hit with the kids! I'm a New Yorker so I'm picky about my wings and these passed the test!"}
{"text":"Great Quality Chicken Strips!!! They have a great selection of dipping sauces that can be drizzled over top or on the side for dipping. The batter is light and salty and the chicken is 100% breast meat. Very tender. The prices are reasonable and there is a sauce for everyone. For an alternative to \"Fast Food\" that is a bit more healthy than the chain stores give Chicken Shack a try. I prefer them to Canes.  We were told the name change occurred when the original Chicken Bonz owners wanted to increase margin with frozen chicken and lower cost recipes and preparation.   Regardless of the name Chicken Shack is a solid pick for some Good Fried Chicken in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Really the best chicken southeast.   The husband and son go here every chance they have. The chicken fingers are big and juicy and the wings are amazing.  A small order of fries is huge and they are crisp and fresh.   Prices are very reasonable.   The restaurant is a hole in the wall but conveniently located by smith's.   They would have gotten 5 stars if it was a little cleaner.   Staff is friendly and helpful and food comes up fast."}
{"text":"The lemon pepper wings here are the best I've had. I enjoy yard bird and in size and flavor these wings meet my expectations. This location is always busy whenever I'm there, a testament to good food."}
{"text":"I'm for sure a regular at chicken shack. in my opinion it is probably one of the best places to get chicken around town. not only is there good chicken they have exquisite fries. the sports atmosphere is fantastic. for a meal less than $10 you will not leave chicken shack hungry I promise you that."}
{"text":"Made an order to go by phone and an employee with a blonde bleached Mohawk said and I quote \"We're f-ing closed\" as I walked in to pick up. I ignored him and walked up to the counter and paid. Then a family with a small child walked in (keep in mind that the sign still said open and it was 8:38 when they closed at 9:00) and he was so rude that they left. Not even sure what else to say."}
{"text":"freaking awesome everytime !!!! My food is delicious and always fast. the staff is great!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way to the Hoover Dam, and we were very glad we did! Anytime a place has 5 stars you gotta figure they're doing something right. And Chicken Shack certainly didn't fail to impress.   I had the double burger - Two huge patties on an onion roll, served with fries and a drink for like 6 bucks. I don't know how they do it. It's an amazing deal. And to make it even better, they had some of the best french fries I've ever had. Thin, shoestring style fries, but cooked and seasoned to crispy perfection. So few take pride in their fries these days. Chicken Shack is different.  My friend had their signature chicken fingers. I tried one - they too, were truly amazing. Juicy white meat, but crispy on the outside. Again, you could tell they were cooked with purpose, not just by some lackey who's trying to rush through everything. Came with some delicious dipping sauce. For both of us we only spent like $13. Wish they had this place where I live."}
{"text":"FINALLY---- A Chicken Shack close to my house!!! I've been waiting patiently for this location to open and I was excited when I drove by and the OPEN sign was illuminated.   Honestly, I've only ever had the wings and fries at their locations, so my review can only be based on those items.   The chicken is ALWAYS fresh and hot. It's always cooked properly and you always have enough dipping sauce. The fries are OK, but the place isn't called Fry Shack....  The staff is friendly and helpful. They always seem to have smiles on their faces!!   Welcome to the neighborhood!!"}
{"text":"Called to place a pick order. They were pleasant and helpful on the phone. My to go order was ready when I arrived about 10-12 minutes later. I ordered a bunch of wings for a small party with all my sauces on the side. Wings were large, cooked through, and tasted great. Sauces tasted good (chili lime, sweet chili and medium). I will order from them again."}
{"text":"My husband was picking all our stops today, and he loves this place...I however, was underwhelmed.  -Service was friendly -food came out FAST -chicken fingers were good  -several sauce options   -didn't care for the fries, just a personal preference  -coleslaw tasted a little fermented  If he wants to bring me here again I would probably just order the chicken by itself. Good place to get a party platter from - I think the chicken would be awesome in a wrap."}
{"text":"I went yesterday and we got honey BBQ wings with fries and fry sauce. Everything was delicious and the employees were all very nice. We ordered way too many wings, so we brought them home and they were still really good after I microwaved them! I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"It felt like 1950 again.  The wife and I sat outside eating our chicken and fries on a warm evening in February and watched the cars pass by.  They don't have anything like this in our neck of the woods (SoCal).  A very pleasant evening.  Customer service was top notch.  Thanks, we will be back."}
{"text":"The best chicken we have ever had and we eat a lot of chicken wings! Portions were big and sauces all homemade and delicious. Fries were skinny,perfectly salted and hot. Chris and Anna were the most friendly that we have met on our trip. Many thanks and best of luck!"}
{"text":"Nothing special at this place, mediocre food and bad customer service. The chicken fingers have almost no breading and covered in grease, and very bland you'd figure you could at least taste the grease.      Been here a few times and almost evertime we order the people behind us get their food first, and we just get a simple 5 piece with fries. And when asked about it they were very rude.  Ok maybe you forgot, but to utter obseneties under your breath at a costumer so close they can hear you... that's just wrong!"}
{"text":"Very nice!! The food quality here is excellent!! We both enjoyed their chicken tenders very much. The shoestring fries are very good. The medium sauce is just perfect. We also enjoyed the fry sauce and blue cheese dip.  There's nothing to complain about here. Lovely local place to which we'll return."}
{"text":"Yay! Finally one in Spring Valley. I grew up going to the one in Henderson, so happy that they are expanding. Best Chicken Fingers!"}
{"text":"Highly recommended.  Best fried chicken I have had since arriving to the states in 2014. If you are in the area you must try!  The fries are also awesome.  The wings and fingers (chicken breast prices) were fresh and delicious.  They have many sauces on offer, you can have it over the chicken or on the side. We Tried the sweet chilli, honey BBQ and the honey garlic. All were great.  The only thing missing from this was a beer. They do offer Bud, but, I had a long drive ahead of me after lunch, but if I didn't I definitely would have had a beer with this!"}
{"text":"Went there last night before a move mine at Galaxy theatre. The staff was super friendly the beer was cold I had 6 wings (hot) my wife had chicken fingers with garlic dipping sauce . The chicken wings and the fingers were both cooked perfect and very tasty. We will definitely be back again. Reasonably priced also."}
{"text":"I never thought I would review a Chicken Shack at less than a 5/5, much less a 3/5. I've been a Shack man for the past 5 or so years, having been dozens of times in that span. I was excited to hear another one was opening in Henderson when they announced the Valle Verde location. My first trip was shortly after the grand opening. The chicken was ok but not quite up to par with the Sunset location, and the chili I got on my fries (if you're going to get a combo, do yourself a favor and always upgrade to the chili cheese fries) tasted a little off. I chalked it up to, \"new store kinks.\" I've now been back twice, and only once have I gotten the delicious food I'd expected. This last time might've been my last at this location. If you've ever been to a Chicken Shack, you know that there are two main reasons you eat there: the juiciest chicken in the lightest, crispiest batter on Earth, and the variety of amazing sauces. This location seems to be experimenting with both--and unfortunately failing.  The batter used today was clearly a different recipe than the classic Shack recipe. It was somewhere between that light crispiness and the thick, crunchy breading you see on frozen chicken strips. Now, even this travesty could be salvaged by the BEST HONEY BARBECUE SAUCE ON EARTH, which they traditionally have. Seriously, I could write sonnets about the smokey, sweet goodness of their HBBQ sauce. But today's recipe for that was wrong too! It was sour, tasting vinegary like they'd tried to make it more like a buffalo sauce.   I'm still giving three stars because the shoestring fries were on point as usual, and they threw in an extra strip--an informal tradition across both locations, where they'll randomly throw in an extra strip if they think that one of the other strips is a little too small, or if they just feel like it. I'm hoping today was just a fluke and the kitchen had the B squad cooking & mixing sauce. If it's not, and these are the new recipes, PLEASE GO BACK!!"}
{"text":"Chose this spot for our first meal in Vegas because we found it on Yelp. I was a bit disappointed maybe because we might be spoiled by California. We thought it was going to be really good but the food was okay. The fries weren't seasoned and the wings were eh. The cashier was okay she kind of gave us an attitude in the beginning because I was asking a question but she made it seemed like my question was dumb. I asked her if the wings that I chose were traditional and she answered what do you mean it's traditional. Girl, isn't it obvious that traditional is bone in? It was a simple question. But she answered with an attitude. Anyways, won't be coming back but hope they improve on the food."}
{"text":"Come early or be patient because the food is good. The fries are crisp and the chicken is hot and tasty. It's a small place so be prepared to say excuse me and smile a lot. Don't be afraid to share a table. Of the table is dirty, it's because the lunch tables turn quick. You'll leave full and satisfied."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time based on other yelp reviews. It was delicious! We ordered the chicken fingers. Huge portions! The sauces are amazing! They give you a ton of fries. The chicken was juicy and the coating was perfect! The service was top notch too! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Place looks friendly. Food is delicious. Staff is nice and very fast at Togo orders. Will be coming back! My food is amazing and the chili cheese fries are bomb"}
{"text":"5 we'll deserved stars. I'm as picky as they come about chicken wings. I typically order boneless because most places don't get bone in right, and I typically leave less than impressed with the dried up over battered boneless product I'm often served.  I live 4 hours from this place and can't wait to stop the next time I pass through. You may remember when Chinese takeout was synonymous with huge portions. This place tops those memories. The boneless chicken is moist and flavorful with a nice crunch, and the sauces are on point. It was so good I had to give bone in a try and my extra crispy wings came with the fat well rendered, the chicken moist and the skin crunchy.  Plus, they were wings from a full grown chicken, not one of those game hen wings most places serve.  The bathroom was spotless. My family does not do germs. We carry hand sanitizer in to cleanse after washing. I was all sorts of impressed withy the cleanliness of the bathroom.  When I'm going back to Cali, I'm stopping at the Chicken Shack."}
{"text":"I was in a mood for some chicken wings and I went on Yelp to find a place.  I am so glad I did because my sister and I enjoyed our meal.  We got the combination 6 wings, french fries, and sodas, and I added a cole slaw.  My wings and fries were so delicious and hot.  We enjoyed the parmesan cheese (they have wet or dry) and original with a side of teriyaki sauce.  We didn't need the sauce because it tasted great without it.  We couldn't finish the fries because there was a big pile of them.  The two workers were so nice and welcoming.  We are going back.  Try this place, you will like it!"}
{"text":"Our favorite place we went while in Nevada! Get a lot of food for what you pay, and the fries are the best I've EVER had! Service was great too. Cashier was very helpful as it was our first time visiting. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Good but Raising Canes chicken fingers are better IMO. Fries are the bomb!"}
{"text":"The food and service here are AMAZING!!!!!!!! We had an encounter with Zeek recently who was awesome. The portions are huge and the quality is even better.If you are hungry for chicken, this is the place to go. We got the Shack Pack and my family of 4 came home with more than half the food there was so much"}
{"text":"Alrighty, although there were a few minor issues I have to say this is my new favorite wing spot. I walked in and was greeted by a cool cashier chick with tats and a hat. She led me to order the #1 which was 6 wings (I chose 3 medium and 3 garlic parm), fries and a drink for around ten bucks and within 10 minutes they were yelling my name that my order was ready.  The wings are large and meaty for the record but when I bit into my first medium wing it was an odd feeling of wonderful flavor mixed with disappointment that it wasn't as hot in the inside as it was on the outside. My next wing was garlic Parmesan (plain wing with some powdered Parmesan) and that bad boy was nice and hot on the inside.....idk why, but they were oddly different temperatures. The fries were whatever, there were a ton of them but they weren't anything special. The ranch was fine too but I'm a dipper and I should have asked for two.  I could almost live on those medium wings (next time I'll try a few lemon pepper) but I won't be ordering the boring garlic Parmesan again and depending on the occasion I'll probably just go for wings without fries. Lastly, there is only one small bathroom and it wasn't a dump just a little dusty here and there."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT!!! Chicken Shack has very friendly service and the food is good too. Also, the sauces were amazing!! I will be going back for sure. #FiveStars"}
{"text":"I've passed Chicken Shack many times but have never came close to coming in.  Same center as Ross J's Aloha Grill. It is next to a Smiths and doesn't have a sign that stands out.  So I didn't expect much other than another chicken place.  Was I mistaken.   First thing that caught my eyes were all the various quotes and license plates all over the walls, NICE.  Even saw a license plate from Hawaii that started with a 'K'. I'm 100% sure that a 'K' means it's from Kauai, my home.  They most have known I was coming LOL.  They have 2 flat screen TVs and two arcade games, PAC-MAN and Marvel Super Heros vs Street Fighter.  There wasn't anyone there when I arrived around 2-3pm.  But I just missed the rush, as I was waiting for my food it started to pick up and it was filled.  I ordered the #4 which was 3 wings, 3 fingers, fries and drink for $7.95. LOVED IT.  The wings were good, cant really mess that up.  But the fingers were AWESOME must have been a rhino's fingers, they were plumped, crispy and crunch on the outside, and juicy on the inside. The fries were different, it was prepared like how you would fry calamari and salty but really good, not your regular salt combination.  Something that I've been doing lately and recommend is having the sauce on the side.  My sauce of choice this time was the Hot Teriyaki sauce which was a perfect complement to the saltiness.  I left full but really wanted more.   After talking to one of the worker I found out that Chicken Shack or at least this location has been open for 8 years already. I wished I found this place earlier, especially now that I don't live in the area, this would have been my regular eats.  They have a HH special which is actually all day everyday, its 12 wings, bucket of beers, and a basket of fries for $16. Which might be a good deal.  They also make burgers, sandwiches, and a fried or grilled chicken salad. I'll be back soon definitely."}
{"text":"Great wings and fingers! Garlic Parm fries are ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Super friendly place!!!!!!! Haven't been here in a while because I'm so used to having sandwiches at the lake and on the way home I'm just not hungry yet.  But! They do have fresh, never frozen chicken wings!  Only downfall is they're just a little bit overbreaded. Good fries. Just wish they were made fresh all the time just like the wings."}
{"text":"Just happen to pass by here on my way from Arizona going to Vegas and boy, they have great chicken wings!!!"}
{"text":"First of all....the chicken fingers are so juicy, my girlfriend ordered the chicken fingers with a garlic parmesan dry rub and it's very good.  I ordered the #4 3 wings 3 fingers and upgraded the fries for chili fries, the chili is delicious. I got honey BBQ for dipping sauce. It's pretty good.   We'll definitely come back after our trips to Lake mead   Which is like every weekend lol"}
{"text":"In vegas for veterans day and I was driving to the Hoover Dam with my friends and was starving for something good!  Saw a little old place in Boulder City that was once a drive in diner called the Chicken Shack!  I ordered 2 #4 combinations of  3 wings 3 chicken fingers and an order of fries.  Have to say I was surprised at how great the fried chicken is.  It reminded me of chicken I used to eat flavor and seasoning 20 years ago at Tuskegee University at a place called the chicken coop.  Chicken had just enough flavor and seasoning , the chicken fingers were good also but I like the fried chicken pieces better. The French fries were great also and so was the iced tea for it to be in Nevada it was probably the best sweet iced tea I had a long time.  This is a place owned by a couple and they were really friendly and made me feel right at home would definitely recommend going again!"}
{"text":"Our 1st time at Chicken Shack was at the Boulder City branch. It was good so we were happy to see a branch open nearby. Unfortunately today's order was toooooo salty! :( we ordered creamy garlic parmesan and lemon chicken. Both of them were too salty. It was terrible to eat the wings on its own. Good thing the macaroni salad and coleslaw were amazingly deliciously and helped even out the saltiness. Regardless, wings should be delicious on its own. Not salty. I hope this is just a rare incident. We'll still come back and hope to have better wings next time."}
{"text":"Mom and pop chicken place.  Everyone very friendly.  Yes, the chicken-- both wings and fingers are freshly made. Both quite good.  The thing I didn't expect was the taste of the fries.  They were dam near McDonald fry like appeal.     I was full but kept eating the generous portion you get with the combo.   Check them out, you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Best wings in town, without a doubt. Fast friendly service. Awesome fries."}
{"text":"This place is great I give it five stars total. Its a small place its always full and that means hot food. Nope you wont get any cold food here. They have wings, strips and fries. They have strong good soda pop with a extra clean soda pop machine. Rather you eat it inside or take it home you will be hooked on they chicken. They have cool quotes on the wall about chickens. This place is also not over priced so it wont kill your budget if your like me and your on a budget."}
{"text":"Move over Hooters and Buffalo Wild Wings cause I found the best chicken wings ever!!    The size of their wings are so massive that it beats out all the other chicken spots I've tried.  Yes they're full of flavor, too!  So far I've only tried the garlic parmesan and habanero honey with ranch dipping sauce and it was so good!    Prices are great, too!"}
{"text":"First off I've eaten the fingers here before and they're good. But today I wanted wings and I took them to go. I was pretty disappointed. Who breads wings and doesn't tell you they're breaded? It doesn't say on the menu and the cashier didn't say anything even when I asked for well done. Which should have been a clue to what I was expecting. My daughter got the fingers and every thing too salty on top off that. So that's why I now only rate them 3 stars."}
{"text":"This place is \"A-OK\" as the 3 star rating indicates.  I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but it's a better alternative than, say, gnawing my own arm off.  The shoestring fries would be very tasty, but they were so covered in salt that I couldn't eat more than a couple.  It must've been a heavy-handed day in the kitchen based on everyone's otherwise rave reviews.  I had chicken fingers and they were tasty.  The breading was good and they were cooked well.  The ranch was runny, but yummy.  It's expensive for what you get, but not highway robbery.  Also, the woman at the counter needs to relax a bit.  Honey, you're not running a Fortune 500 company.  It's the Chicken Shack.  Take a chill pill sister."}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight closer to closing then I like to but regardess of the time I was greeted right as I walked  through the door with a very friendly hello instead of the eye rolls I expected because of the time. The customer service was 100% and the food was great. What a lucky employer to have such a great staff!"}
{"text":"Came to try the wing they had great food but amazing service! I've never felt so welcomed! Priscilla was so helpful and not to mention very patient! Hands down the best service I've ever experienced!"}
{"text":"Good salty food Dirty sticky tables A bone and a hair in my chili, beware Trash overflowing  Fries and chicken are as good as I remembered however, seems like this place is going downhill."}
{"text":"Best chicken fingers in Las Vegas! Always fresh, never frozen. This place is almost always busy so don't mind if you have to wait a minute, worth the wait. The ranch dressing is made fresh in house as well as lots of other sauces. A local gem that you should definitely check out!!"}
{"text":"Glad to see the quality and consistency from the original location is here as well! Been a fan of the shack for years! Some people tell me canes is the best (and don't get me wrong I like canes), but chicken shack is the best for fingers in town. Glad there is a closer location to my place in anthem. Too bad they close so early. I guess I'll go to canes late night. Any other time I'm coming here!"}
{"text":"Horrible service and you shouldn't kick someone out of your store at 845 so you can crank the music really loud and kick back with all your buddies. The young men there are very rude and shouldn't be aloud to represent a business that is said to have the best chicken in town. I'm sure the owner of this place wouldn't be impressed with you young men damaging their reputation."}
{"text":"I LOVE CHICKEN SHACK! And I love it even more because it is so close to my house. I have only ordered their wings (honey habanero are my favorite, but all of the flavors are excellent) because they are just too good to pass up on every time I go in. Sauces are unique and do not taste like any other wing place in town. Strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service......experience was ruined by loud music playing overhead. The sauces are great too......I like the variety."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb freaking dot com! The chicken strips are sooo good and fresh, and I love their fries!!"}
{"text":"Just stopped here on a long day trip food was great service was quick and the young man that took our orders was friendly as can be highly recommend you stop by"}
{"text":"My hubs and I always drive by this place when go to the lake. He always insists we go to A&W (because it's so nostalgic for him)...Well I gave it a try but I think I'll be OK if I don't ever eat there again lol. Anywho, driving by again and thought we would stop at chicken shack. So glad we did. I got 5 tenders and fries and he got the sandwich with BBQ sauce. It was soo good. 5 tenders was too much. I ate 2 1/2 pieces...They were so big. I couldn't stop eating the fries tho. Soo yummy and crunchy. This is not every day food but when u need something greasy, and you happen to be hungover on the way to the lake...this hits the spot."}
{"text":"Really good chicken, good prtions, friendly staff. First time here but definately NOT my last."}
{"text":"This place has the best chicken wings in the USA! I always get the lemon pepper dry rub with a few sauces and eat them until I'm miserable! Huge chicken wings, fast service, consistent, and damn good taste!"}
{"text":"Usually go to the one on Sunset. Came here and ordered the same as always. 25 lemon pepper dry rub. This time is tasted like the chicken was in a pool of lemon juice for a month then rolled in salt. Next time went to Sunset and asked if it was different owner or different mix they said no same owner. Service was good but size and taste of chicken left me very disappointed."}
{"text":"Today was my first time at the Chicken Shack. I went to the new location in Boulder City, NV. The building used to be an old Sonic. It was their grand opening today so the lot was super packed, not a single open spot to park. I parked at the o'reillys and walked over to pick up my phone ahead order. Parking was my only issue, but it may be different when it settles from the excitement, so I won't count that against them.  The aroma was amazing and you can hear them frying up that crispy deliciousness. The establishment was clean and has a few indoor tables as well as outdoor seating. When I got there to pick up my order the line was a good 10 deep. I eventually asked one of the gals if my order was the one on the counter. She started to prepare it for me, but the owner or manager (not sure which, could be both) asked if it would be alright for them to fry mine up fresh since those boxes were sitting for about 30 min.  I had come at the right time (20 min estimated) but they must have finished it up ahead of time. There will be a learning curve for pick up orders so it wasn't a big deal to me. She wanted to make sure my stuff was fresh though so I waited another 5 min, paid for my order and was on my way. I really appreciated her thoroughness and effort in ensuring a quality meal...and they did not disappoint.  The chicken was so tender with just enough crunch on the outside. Super tastey and the portions are huge. We ordered large bc we expected small chicken tenders. These were massive. I could only eat 2 (kiddie size for me next time lol). We chose multiple dipping sauces (I got 4 free with my 20pc order and 2 lg fries...each additional was around 40 cents): Chipotle bbq, regular bbq, hot, sweet chili, honey mustard and of course fry sauce. They were all so good and they are quite large...looked like a 2oz plastic ramekin vs the small 1oz you get everywhere else so that's a plus. The fry sauce had a kick! Loved the skinny \"shoe string\" style fries also. The large is an entire togo box full at about $4.19 I think. Needless to say, after feeding 4 people, I brought home an entire box of tenders AND another full box of the fries to my kids.  They offer a deal 20pc tender (or 25 pc wing) 2 lg sides and 4 drinks for like $34.99 but I didn't need the drinks, so I just ordered my 20 pc and fries separate.   We will go again sometime. It was great. :)"}
{"text":"This review is for the Chicken Shack off of St. Rose Parkway and Spencer. I've eaten here twice and to be honest the next time I'll only order the chicken. The chicken is definitely better than Canes. The fries are way too salty. If you have hypertension this is not the place for you. I normally like a little extra salt on my food but this was too much salt for a salt lover like me. My family and I ordered combos with fries and none of us ate the fries. We tried wiping the salt off but that didn't help. The chicken is similar to Canes but with more chicken. :-)"}
{"text":"I'm a frequenter at The Shack and I'll tell you first hand it is quality chicken at a doable price. The first time you try Chicken Shack you will fall in love. Chicken Shack is a definite go-to spot when you're muddled on where to have a bite or if you're coming in for a visit. Chicken Shack is by far one of the finer chicken eateries on the west coast. Would recommend this place to the most loathing person of chicken. Great atmosphere, definite 5 star."}
{"text":"The chicken was juicy and fried well, a testament to keeping fresh oil in the kitchen. The fries are very, very small (shoestring?). The interior has about 5 tables. The exterior has 8 - 10. But since we went at lunch on a hot day, it was a good thing we got an inside table. The staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Fried chicken! Who doesnt love it? Its the best way to eat chicken in my opinion.  Came here obviously to try the chicken- walked in and decor is very cute with all different cute jokes about why the chicken crossed the road.  Menu consists of: Wings, chicken fingers, burgers, sanwhiches, salads, fries Side: baked beans, potato salad, Mac salad, Cole slaw veggie sticks  Homemade chili bowls  We had the sweet chili and garlic Parmesan, Breaded wings. NGL I was concerned about the breaded wings because most placed OVER bread the wings and its too chewy. They dont make naked wings, so I was forced to get the breaded wings. I was very SURPRISED to find they were only lighly breaded and VERY VERY crispy! Absolutely delicious!  6 piece wings are:  7.29$- kinda pricey but worth it They also gave us a free extra wing (idk if that was on purpose)- see pics there are 7 instead of 6   WISH LIST: Wish they had a wing happy hour! And beers would be nice  Will be back!"}
{"text":"My whole family enjoyed this place. Chicken was awesome! Perfectly fried and juicy.  Great portion size for the price. The staff was so friendly.  Customer service excellent!! We will definitely come back when we are back in the area. I would recommend this place to anyone in the mood for fried chicken wings!"}
{"text":"Went in today, saw they had chilli asked about it. The fucktard said \"I don't know\" well that was it!!!  I don't recommend this place, customer service is a fkn joke, place was dead, and dirty!!! I don't feel one star is deserved!!!"}
{"text":"On the road trip, this small restaurant made my day. The chicken and fries are awesome. The restaurant is interesting too, do ask for restroom keys:)"}
{"text":"Meh, it will do. I have tried this place twice, cause of the hype & I wings. The prices are average as far as wings go. The wings are pretty good size, with lots of meat. I have tried the hot BBQ and just regular buffalo wing sauce both were OK. Upon my 2nd visit I politely asked what sauce they recommend, the lady taking my order was kind of a bit## , she just said,\" the sauces are on the menu\" in a snide way. The fries seemed pretty good but mine were doused in salt. What's kinda bs is they charge you for ranch or any sauce. That's like ordering nachos and paying extra for cheese, also there's no celery to bite into when your mouth is burning. All that aside, I didn't think this place was anything special. I will probably try it again if there is a spectacular sauce someone can reccomend and I have better customer service."}
{"text":"Some of the best wings in Las Vegas. Perfect place to order wings for your football party!"}
{"text":"Best fried chicken ever! The chicken was perfectly cooked & juicy. Love the many choices of sauce & friendly, welcoming service! Next time I'm passing through Vegas this is a sure pit stop!"}
{"text":"Yum. I had no idea this opened. So happy to to have a location close to me. I used to go to the one on sunset with my friends. The selection of sauces is awesome, but there are so many to choose from it can be tough to decide"}
{"text":"We had a great lunch at chicken shack. We shared a 12 piece chicken half garlic cream and half habanero honey. With a small fry and coleslaw. Everything had great flavor. Chicken was cooked well. Fries were shoestring and plenty to share between the two of us. The coleslaw was cold and had a great balance of sweet and savory.   We at in the car to avoid the sun and we had our dogs with us. The owner came out and checked on us and even fed our three dogs with a little treat from her own dogs private grilled chicken stash! All of us left full and satisfied! Highly recommended :)"}
{"text":"OK so we gave it ANOTHER shot because this used to be our go to place but AGAIN the Chicken Tenders were SOGGY AND UNDERCOOKED!!!!  I don't know what the heck the new owners are doing but get it together and cook the Chicken Tenders the way the previous owners did them.  The wings seem to be the same but the Chicken Tenders are NOT THE SAME!!!  AWFUL!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way from the airport to our hiking adventure. Totally exceeded expectations! Fried chicken was fresh and delicious, coleslaw and beans were superb sides, and the skinny fries were the perfect consistency. I got a salad and the lettuce was legitimate romaine, not the crap you get in a usual \"fast food\" salad. This place was excellent, highly recommend for a fast and yummy stop."}
{"text":"Place is legit. Visiting here from So Cal and long day on the boat. Kids didn't want to go out, so I went to pick something up. The Chicken Shack came up on my Google Map, so I read a few reviews all giving this place excellent ratings. So, we got the Family Shack Pack and split the wings and fingers, got the beans, Cole slaw and French fries. We all ate good, nothing left as we demolished it how good it was. We will definitely come back when we are back at the Lake."}
{"text":"We were arriving in Boulder City later in the evening and were looking for a place that served salad.  The Chicken Shack had a tasty Salad with either Grilled or Fried Chicken strips.  The Service was quick and the staff were very friendly.   It was easy to find from highway 93 and the prices were very affordable.  Definitely a classic family style drive -in and restaurant.  The kids will love the squeaky chicken restroom key! :-)"}
{"text":"Some good meaty chicken tenders.The sauce is what makes it. I highly recommend getting two sauces just to try them. We had the hot barbeque and the ranch tonight. The hot barbeque is impressive to say the least. You get a nice solid Smokey taste with a fun kick afterwords. 4 stars because they give a next to gross amount of fries. I can imagine people loving that but it was a bit too much for us."}
{"text":"Stopped by just to try this place out because of the great Yelp reviews... I must say everyone was right! If you see this place try it!! You won't be disappointed.. Amazing taste.. 2 thumbs up.."}
{"text":"One of the best local places, they serve big and juicy pieces! And not to mention their fries! They might be a bit thin but they're really good and taste fresh."}
{"text":"I don't like sauces normally, but I like their sauces. Really fresh chicken, though it seems like they don't season the batter at all because they rely on the sauces for flavor.   Try the cajun with fresh parm!"}
{"text":"Stopped in after going out to Hoover Dam and it was really good. I like that the place had an old feel to it. Everyone was very friendly and they greeted us before we walked in. I ordered the #4 which is the wing and tender combo. The chicken wasn't over fried and had a good flavor to it. You can definitely tell that the tenders were fresh and not the ones that come out of a bag. I had the honey habanero sauce and it was very good. I'm not a big fan of the shoestring fries but these were really good. They didn't taste like chips and they give you plenty. The price for the meal was well worth it. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"The place is called chicken shack... so they should have amazing finger-licking good chicken right? Meh. I left a little disappointed. I ordered the chicken strips which I found were overly dry. The strips were large with a lot of meat to them and not too much breading which I liked, however the pieces were just too dry overall.   I will give it to them that they have every dipping sauce you can think of and then some. So I liked the choices there. And extra points because their French fries are awesome! Thin and crispy and perfect to munch on."}
{"text":"You come here for the chicken, however, you will be disappointed if you need a clean setting to eat. The food is nice, where the chicken is juicy and breaded with a nice crisp. My favorite sauce Is this sweet chili. I ask for it on the side, because I like to dip it. The fries are shoe string, but a much better quality than fast food joints. It's crunchy but still has a good amount of potato innards. The main problem I see about the chicken shack is how so many people come, dine in, and go that the workers have no time to clean. They are too busy cooking abd taking orders. Therefore, crumbs are everywhere, no clean tables, and trash cans get filled. I recommend then for take out. If you dine in, you could actually wipe your table using Pattie towels and their fountain water.   Anyways, the pros outweigh the cleanliness con. Go try it!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite lunch joint in Vegas. Sevice is super fast! Sometimes I receive my food before I finish filling my drink cup. The chicken fingers are amazing!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here tonight! I read other reviews that complained about the size of the place, and it is small, but it's called My Chicken Shack, not My Chicken Palace. The name suits the size.   It was busy when I went tonight, but not too cramped and they definitely had a good amount of tables for groups to sit at. I waited maybe 5 minutes in line before I ordered; they had only one register from what I could see. There were a lot funny phrases playing with the \"Why did the chicken cross the road?\" question all around on the walls though that entertained me while I waited to order.   When I reached the counter, the worker was friendly and provided recommendations of popular sauces to have for my wings. There are definitely a lot of options to suit everyone's preference. I ended up ordering 6 of his recommended Honey BBQ and 6 of my personal choice of Medium. The Honey BBQ was good! I could have done without the Medium though, it was whatever.   I ordered the 10 piece chicken fingers with Chipotle BBQ sauce for my boyfriend and was asked if this order was for one person. When I said yes, I was warned about the size of the chicken fingers and that it might be too much for just one person. I decided to stick with it but.. damn, he was right! Those things are huge!!! I thought the fingers were better than the wings too, honestly.   They only have one size option for drinks too, and it's probably the equivalent to most places' small size. I didn't dine in but it looked like you could have unlimited refills, at least.   I had high expectations for this place considering how busy it always looks from the outside. I'm not sure these expectations were met, though. It was good - don't get me wrong - but I was expecting it to be the most amazing chicken I have ever had and I think my hopes were a bit too high.   Rating is really a 3.5 but giving them the benefit of a 4. I would go back, but only now and then."}
{"text":"First off I want to start off with is customer service is great, young lady had a smile on her face,was open to any questions we had as well.   Ok so I'm not sure if it's just me, but Breaded wings just don't do it for me. I just went for a simple wing craving, but left very unsatisfied. Didn't really think they were fresh wings either.   I have forever been looking for a place where they serve lemon pepper wings that's a sauce instead of a rub. Which I was led to believe they had it here because under sauces lemon pepper was right underneath.  The breading  of the wings took to much of the flavor from the lemon pepper. Also they were a bit too dry as well.  If you're a person who digs the breading by all means. But I think I'll stick to Wingstop and Buffalo wild wings for my wing cravings."}
{"text":"Read the reviews from this place a couple weeks ago and got excited, and as usual...I was let down!!! I never like to review a place after one visit anymore, so I gave it a couple chances. Fail fail fail.   To succeed in business, you need great customer service. This place does not have it. After reading on their website that they close at 9pm, I get in my car around 7:45pm to travel 11 miles to this place. I arrive around 8:15pm. It's a family of four head of me in line. The guy behind the register is preparing some take out orders and never acknowledged them. They had enough with the waiting, and the lady says she's ready to order. His response? \"Oh we're closed\". What the hell are you talking about you're closed? He says \"we close at 8:30 and its 8:31\". I couldn't believe what I was seeing or hearing! If the customer is inside before those doors are locked? You're still open for them!!! The lady and her family angrily walk out, and I do the same. What made me even more mad??? I get to my car and see that it's only 8:24pm!!! The boy was straight up lying to our faces!!!  I told myself that I was done with that place, but because of such high remarks on yelp, I wanted to try the food. Decided to go back the weekend after, early in the day, so I can see if the hype was real. Ordered 3 wings, 3 tenders and fries. Back in college, I worked for KFC... So I know exactly what old fryer oil looks like when used on chicken, and what it smells like. Old oil (reused or not changed) will make your chicken darker, and make it taste funny. This was the case with Chicken Shack. Absolutely nasty. Fries were soggy and lacking taste. It was so bad that it prompted me to go online to find out who owns this place. Whoever you are...we need to speak.   You served me a trash worthy product. Get it together. Will not return."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here every once in a while for chicken tenders. We would come here everyday but unfortunately it's across town from us but when we are on this side of town we come here. Well this visit was different because I ordered chicken wings instead of chicken tenders! Their chicken wings were a game changer. I will never order anything else but their chicken wings. They are so damn good like you can't go to any other fried chicken ever again because they are that good! They are buttermilk battered and fried just like the tenders. But they seriously taste like miniature fried chicken! Omg.... Drool. I've literally been trying to find a fried chicken place and now I can finally stop looking. Chicken Shack won. They won all the awards. I don't care what anyone says. Man like after I finished my meal I wished I had another basket of wings...  Another thing though, their service was spot on seriously. We went in there at peak lunch time. People clocked out for lunch and headed over here. The line was basically out the door. But they were so fast and efficient it was amazing to watch them work. We literally ordered, got our drinks, haven't even sat down for a minute and our food was already ready. Talk about fast food. And that was literally everyone's orders too. They barely sat down and their food was already done. It was piping hot and their portions are always generous. They always give you extra. My boyfriend ordered a 3 finger combo and they gave him 2 extra tenders. He almost mad that he got extra tenders because he couldn't eat it all haha. Chicken shack is always the best choice for chicken tenders and wings."}
{"text":"I used to crave this place, last two visits the chicken has been tougher and on the dryer side. Not sure if they changed the type of chicken or it's the cook."}
{"text":"Nice little joint you guys got here tucked away in a plaza off of East Sunset Road.  I ordered the number 1 combination which consists of 6 Wings, Fries, and a Drink for 8.29 plus tax. I chose chipotle honey barbeque sauce for the wings which has a nice combination of sweet and spicy. The wings themselves has a slight breading on it which gives it more of a crunch to its crispiness.  As for the fries, SHOESTRING! I dont think I have had shoestring fries that good in a long time. If anything, I would go out on a limb and say it was even better than the wings! I can only fantasize how good their chili cheese fries might be.   They also have chicken strips, burgers, and a salad with your choice of grilled or fried chicken.   Now for the downers. Their prices are bit high for your basic chicken wings. The biggest thing I think that doesnt make sense is that they dont serve you any sauces with your wings like ranch, blue cheese, etc. Of course you can have your choice of dipping sauce but only if you wanna pay extra. Also if you want veggies like celery or carrots, that is also a separate charge. WHAT? When you think of wings, you see a plate or basket full of wings, fries, veggies and dipping sauce. That right there is perfection. I can think of many other places that give you dipping sauces and veggies included with your meal or at least free when you ask for it.   With everything mentioned, mostly good and a little bit of bad, this warrants 4 stars. To the owners, if you are reading this, a little bit of sauce and veggies goes a long way."}
{"text":"Fucking excellent! This chicken is fucking delicious! So Crispy and no grisly pieces!!! The guy at the counter totally help with anything I needed, this was my first time here and felt so welcome as he helped me decide what I wanted. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm giving 4 stars only for the wings, they are very good. Especially in Habanero Honey sauce !"}
{"text":"Their chicken fingers with the fry sauce are absolutely incredible. Definitely favorite chicken/fries combo in town. Quick, convenient, and filling... & super affordable!"}
{"text":"It's really, really good. And it's consistently good. I've been here no less than 10 times over the past year, and my orders are always done within a few minutes.  The chicken is seasoned and juicy. You get to choose your flavor of sauce. The portions are generous. I always am given an extra tender and tons of fries.   I can't believe I've been going to Canes all this time.  In-restaurant dining can get crowded. They don't have a lot of space to meet the demand. Tables are full of paper towels which is much better than napkins. Drinks are small."}
{"text":"So disappointing. Service is exceptionally slow. How does it take 10+ minutes to put chicken and fries in a box, with 5+ people working, when I'm the only person there? I even gave this location a second chance hoping that the slow service the first time was a fluke. Nope.  Please learn best practices from the Sunset/GV Pkwy location, where I have my order by the time I'm done filling up my drink, where I am always given an extra tender, and the fries and chicken are actually seasoned."}
{"text":"GREAT wings.  Big and greasy and juicy.  An order of six wings, fries and a drink could easily feed two.  A new favorite when funds are low and we are visiting."}
{"text":"5 stars for a fast food place. Clean, great service and price. The chicken sandwich has 3 chicken fingers. Fries were crispy and delicious. I came here on the way to willow beach AZ. Salads are big and there is lots of different dressings to choose from."}
{"text":"Great food. The atmosphere is pretty relax. They also brought some grilled chicken out for our dog. Good stuff will definitely be back every time we're doing a lake day.  The staff is really nice. Really clean spot for the age of the building. The workers sure show their pride with their job. Good to know there's good employees here. Keep up the great job guys. Definitely going to be a regular when we're around."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 5 years. Food and service has always been good and the owners really are cordial. Feels like family almost. You HAVE to try the lemon pepper!"}
{"text":"Always great food! Fingers tender, wings delicious. Staff friendly and nice. Great local place to come especially on our way to the movies."}
{"text":"The. Best. Chicken. Also, their ranch is off the wall good, and they have every sauce you could think of. So great. The service is always good. I'll keep coming back for years to come."}
{"text":"You instantly get the warmth of a small business as soon as you enter. The lady at the register treated each person like a distinguished guess (mom in the back was even nice). The menu is simple but the sauces are packed with all kinds of awesomeness. I went with the plain wings with hot teriyaki and sweet chili on the side. The fries were shoestring cut, fried to perfection, and flavored with fun.   I really dig this place and cant wait to go back. I NEED MORE SAUCE!!!"}
{"text":"Good homemade chicken strips they were bigger then expected! A lot of seasonings and dip kids loved it!"}
{"text":"Phone order your food ahead of time.. The batter they use for the wings here are amazing!"}
{"text":"Driving back to Phoenix from Vegas and decided to stop and try it after reading the reviews on Yelp. So glad we did... the food was delicious! Chicken fingers were juicy and perfectly crispy. Chicken wings were huge and cooked perfectly. Shoe string fries were crunchy but soft on the inside. Portions were very large. Service was great and we were greeted right away. We will definitely keep this place on our list of places to eat every time we travel to Vegas."}
{"text":"I don't know where some of these bad reviews about the chicken being dry and such but I guess they changed things up cause my chicken fingers were thick and juicy and yes I would say they are waaay better than Caine's. The staff was very nice and I would come back here again!"}
{"text":"The chicken was great!! If you like Raising Canes, you'll love Chicken Shack! It's like a more homemade canes with more variety on the menu. I expected the food to take a little longer to be prepared than Canes, but it was actually brought out to me extremely fast.  Not only is the food great, the service is excellent. I had Eddie as a cashier and he was very friendly and helpful. He brought the food to our table and even came by to check up on us and asked how everything was knowing it was our first time there! He was kind and courteous to even the children in the restaurant no matter how busy it got! That guy would be an excellent waiter.  I will definitely be returning to chicken shack for the tasty chicken fingers, bomb sauces, and friendly employees.  ALSO I LOVE THEIR CRISPY SHOE STRONG FRENCH FRIES!!! I prefer these to crinkle cut fries any day!"}
{"text":"The best chicken in town!! And it's still a mom and pop shop!! Love it and the super friendly service!! You eat here once u will comeback for more!! Guaranteed"}
{"text":"The food is exceptional and priced right. Must try when in Henderson! Try the Chili. A great selection of sauces to choose from. Great staff."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for Chicken wings in Las Vegas!  It took me a while to find a great wing place, as sadly Vegas does not have many, but when I found this place I was hooked!   First and foremost they have sweet tea!  For me this is a big win as I grew up in the south and sweet tea is the House Wine for any southerner.  And yes there is a major difference between making sweet tea and taking a sugar packet and adding it to unsweetened tea! hahahaha  The quality of it can very.  Sometimes it is great and other times it is not. But hey I am in Vegas so I cant be too picky lol  As far the chicken wings they are HUGE!  Much larger then a normal wing.  Not sure where they get the chicken from but the chickens must have a weight room and spent the day bulking up.  The wings are pretty tasty and fried well.  6 wings here is definitely a good size meal.    The sauces vary in good to OK.  After trying a multitude of them I have settled on the Hot BBQ and the Hot Teriyaki.  I like the heat that both provide along with the balanced taste of the BBQ Sauce and Teriyaki sauce.   I am not a huge fan of the Lemon Pepper as it can tend to be on the really salty side along with being a dry rub.  The past couple of times I have been they have added new flavors.  This is always nice to see as it shows they are experimenting with new things.  I always make it a point to try the newest ones.  They can usually be found on the chalk board next to the register.   The fingers are also really good and they have meals that are reasonably priced.  They come with fries and a drink!  The fires are also a plus as they are on the thinner side.  I would recommend trying the fry sauce with them.    The decor is all based on the joke why did the chicken cross the road.  If you dine in or are waiting for your food they are pretty entertaining to read.  They also have some TVs and a little outside seating.  Overall it is a small space so not a ton of seating.    I would call there style of wings pretty standard, nothing fancy, just wings fried and served tossed in pretty typical choices.  If you have never been I would give it a whirl as it is much better then most of the places that sell wings here in Vegas."}
{"text":"We arrived a bit early to see Mad Max at the Galaxy Luxury Theater, so we decided to find something to munch on to kill the next hour. We found a few places nearby on Yelp! and saw the solid reviews for The Chicken Shack and decided to check it out!  What i liked...  - Had an order of chicken wings and an order of chicken fingers, serving size was generous and both the wings and fingers were plump and meaty! I like! - they do give you a generous portion of ranch sauce, but if you wish to have an additional or different sauce there is an extra charge for that - Beer on tap for decent prices, especially compared to what you will get at the movie theater. - very fun and chill atmosphere with the 90's music playing and funny little phrases adorning the walls plus a ton of license plates and other unique little things - Service was pretty quick, and they were pretty busy when we were in there  What I didn't like...  - tables were not very clean. Having someone just wipe the tables down between customers would make a big difference - customer service was spotty. Some of the guys were very friendly while others would barely speak  - this place is very small and when it gets busy, it can feel cramped quickly   Others items to note..  - their soda fountain consists of Pepsi products - this seems to be a very popular spot for the high school/college aged crowd. Nothing wrong with that. Merely an observation. Lots of \"dude\", \"man\", and \"bro\"'s were being flung about recklessly.  I really am so back and forth between 3 or 4 stars on this place. The wings were nice and plump, but lacked any kind of seasoning or flavoring. The chicken meat on the fingers were excellent! I will definitely be back to try out more menu items and snag some more of those chicken fingers! After a couple more visits, I could easily see myself bumping this up to 4 stars. For now though, I like the Chicken Shack, but it's just..  A-OK.  3 stars."}
{"text":"We love the tenders and the salty fries. It's the sauces that make it 5 stars for our family.   It would be great if they power washed the outdoor tables. They are grilled and so can't be wiped clean."}
{"text":"Great wings and a huge selection of sauces that are amazing. Little bit tight for inside seating though."}
{"text":"My go to place to have chicken and fries! The staff is very friendly and even the smallest combo is very filling! I always take friends from out of town here."}
{"text":"This is possibly one of the nastiest wing places I've ever been to in my entire life I tried a different location the first time which was also gross so I decided to give another location a chance...EPIC FAIL! Food is super bland, and dry...if you can mess up wings, you just shouldn't cook anything period. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT AND WASTE OF MONEY!"}
{"text":"The wings were really good but the customer service left something to be desired. It was my first time going there and the cashier had no patience when I was ordering my meal. While deciding on my options the cashier rudely remarked \"Well I guess you don't like answering questions\". The experience left me very frustrated. Next time I will pass on this place and go somewhere I can enjoy my meal and my ordering experience."}
{"text":"Best chicken in town !!!! I always get the #2 with baked beans. Bomb chicken tenders and chicken wings. Customer service is on point as well thanks guys keep it up"}
{"text":"On HWY 93 your way to Hoover Dam I'd recommend stoping your auto for some fresh mouth watering fried chicken. We stopped for a quick lunch and boy we're we're thrilled by The Chicken Shack.   After perusing the menu for a moment we ordered several tasty items. I ordered a small chili, 6 wings w/fries basket and chicken strips. Now your probably asking yourself why would you order chili, well simple answer cause its gems like this happen when u least expect it. And that was damn good chili ! Chili is definitely a worthy item to order, its meaty & full of beans and topped with onions & sour cream. As for the chicken portion of my order well this place didn't disappoint me on the bird. Wings were moist and battered with some really tasty spicing. I got mine plain, however you have many flavor options to add to the mix.  These strips were like no ordinary strips, they were sensational all white meat pieces and really thick ( two finger sized ). You really didn't need sauce but what the heck I used anyways. Make your own choice this is America!  You must stop for a bucket of wings if not your insane. I'll roll back in next time I'm in Boulder City for another order."}
{"text":"My son & his friends LOVE chicken shack so I decided to give it a try. It is a very busy place so they must be doing something right. My biggest complaint is how small the place is. I was placing an order to go, the counter to order is in the back, there is a 4 top on the left & the soda dispenser on the right. I have an 18 month old & had her with me. So trying to not have her grabbing or hitting the people at the table & not play with the soda machine left VERY LITTLE room. I was in the way of staff coming from the back to hand out orders & for people trying to get refills. We finally get to the counter & I asked a few questions making it obvious it was my 1st visit. I place an order for 24 lemon pepper wings & a garlic Parmesan fingers meal. I pay & turn around to go wait & there's nowhere to go. They was 3 people in line behind me 2 other people waiting for their to go orders & 2 people trying to get refills. SO CROWDED. I finally get out of the way & go to wait at a 2 top, the only open table. My order didn't take to long. I get home w it & unpack it & there was no sauce for anything, wings, fingers or fries. I'm assuming now it's something you order as well. That would've been nice to know.    Now the food itself, it was very good. The chicken was cooked to perfection & the fries were great. We will go back but try different flavored, the lemon pepper was good, garlic Parmesan needs more garlic & Parmesan. We'll also be sure to ask for sauces!"}
{"text":"Leaving Vegas we were looking for a quick place to eat but didn't want McDonald's, Taco Bell, etc. The outside looked a little sketchy with yellow caution tape in the parking lot so we kept driving. There were cars in the lot so decided to pull over and check the reviews. After reading a few positive reviews we made a u-turn and went back. It was by far the best chicken strips I've ever eaten. Big, juicy, tender white meat with lots of yummy sauces to choose from. I got the 3 wings, 3 strips & fries with a drink for $8. Worth every penny!"}
{"text":"I've been to the other location. This one is much cleaner. The service is excellent. The food is prepared to order, hot and delicious.  I have been there five times already and they havent even been open a month.  I wish them great success!  Just hope they dont turn it into a LOUD SPORTS RELATED experience cause I like to be able to hear my conversation with friends when we visit. That would stop me dead in my tracks from coming back."}
{"text":"Love me some chicken shack. My boyfriend introduced me to this place recently and it was so damn good! I had the fingers and fries basket, the chicken was super tender and the honey BBQ i got for it was so good. Small place but it was comfortable and the staff was helpful."}
{"text":"The chicken was undercooked and it was way too chewy! A waste of money and no one liked it. For some odd reason, the mild tasted sweet."}
{"text":"Great sauces. Good fries. Bland chicken if you're not getting a wet sauce added to the chicken wings or tenders.  The staff was friendly, the place clean, and once again.... the fries were AWESOME."}
{"text":"First time ever at this place and i love chicken so i lovebthis place gokd food will be back soon just doen the street from me"}
{"text":"They are doing a decent job. It is not easy to duplicate a successful franchise and if they keep at it it will be as good as the Vegas location.   Might be a good idea to mute sports on the TV's and play mainstream music at a tolerable level instead of blaring the annoying TV network blather they have had on the last three times I was in there.  I suggest they stay on top of cleaning the frying oil, be extra vigilante on the chicken suppliers and freshness....and do their best not to freeze chicken if they don't have to. I can't wait for the beer license!"}
{"text":"Almost didn't stop because they have Pepsi instead of Coke but we are so thankful that we did! This place is amazing! Best chicken fingers I've ever had! French fries are also absolutely amazing definitely some of the best french fries I have ever ate.  I am so thankful we stopped at this place!  The staff here is excellent, super friendly!  Try the habanero honey mixed with ranch sauce!  Yummy!!!   Fry Sauce is a must!!"}
{"text":"This review is truly a 3.5, BUT everyone knows how I feel about good service and they had it. I could really make this one short and sweet. Better quality chicken than wing stop or b-dubs, not better sauces. Similar concept, but more mom and pop style instead of chain food. To me you can taste the freshness, which made up for the \"just so-so\" garlic parm flavor. Also tried spicy teriyaki and I expected more spice. The spicy ranch however was AMAZING. I think their dips are up to par if not better than the rest. I upped it to 4 also because I haven't tried all the sauces yet, and I will for sure return based on quality N service.  Another good local Hendo spot! Check!"}
{"text":"This place is down the street from me so I decided to try it. The fries are scrumptious, thin & crispy the best! The fingers are large, the sauces are yummy! It could use a real good cleaning inside, but it is, what it is and for a yummy quick bite to eat, I like it! I have to try some other items next time! I will be back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Such a great atmosphere. It's in a good location usually busy but they are quick with your order and always on point. The guy usually at the counter taking orders is super friendly and nice. Every item on the menu is delicious and original!! Recommend this place to everyone!! They should totally expand!!"}
{"text":"We love love love Chicken Shack, especially the fries!  This location is fast and their staff is friendly. The indoor seating is limited and usually full but they have some outdoor seating as well. Food is always fresh and great!"}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW! The chicken is fresh and hand-battered and my husband raved about the fries. We will definitely be back in to have more when we go west."}
{"text":"If I eat any more of their strips, I will grow feathers.  This unassuming small eatery has great strips.  I am the kind of person that tries to eat things I wouldn't normally cook, and chicken strips is one of those  things on my \"don't buy it if you can cook it\" foods.  I gave in to my hubby's begging to try this place one day after work.  We drove from the southwest to Henderson just for these strips, and I told him, \"these better be awesome for the trip.\"  Fortunately, he was right--the strips are awesome.  They are huge (I'm wondering what size these chickens are) and juicy.  Their coating is great and the sauces are wonderful.  I love their shoestring fries, but I was honed in to those strips and downed three on my own.  I even gave the wings a try, and they are quite tasty.    Overall, a great place to stop for some chicken.  I will drive down to Henderson just for these strips despite a closer competitor.  They're awesome."}
{"text":"Fresh chicken fingers, love the fries and the sauce .  The dining area could be bigger and lately we've had to wash the tables ourselves (employees seem to forget to do it when the customer leaves)"}
{"text":"I love the Chicken Shack! The food is amazing and the atmosphere is great all the staff seems to be pretty knowledgeable and very attentive!"}
{"text":"Passing through from Vegas and so glad that we stopped in. Great burgers and chicken strips. Add the nice owners and you've got a place that we'll come back to"}
{"text":"A lot of food for the money. Thoroughly enjoyed my chicken strips and dipping sauces. I'm from California, so when I'm in Vegas, I make sure I stop here for the strips!"}
{"text":"This place is packed and it seems like they have a real loyal following.  I got the wings and fingers combo and i definitely like the wings more as they were super crispy, tasty, and enjoyed the variety of sauces they provided.  The fingers were good but I prefer canes.   Good size portions and great value.   They serve a few things but they do it well.  I'll def be back when I'm on this side of town and have a craving"}
{"text":"The best chicken fingers I've ever had! Very juicy/ moist white meaty! Chicken! Had the damn hot sauce on the side! I personally give it a complete hands down!"}
{"text":"Great customer service. All the staff had a smile on their faces not to mention the food is awesome!! Will be coming back"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. The chicken is awesome. The fries are great. They have a ton of sauces to choose from. What more can someone ask for?  Around lunch, this place is jammed full of people and for good reason. The service is fast, and the food is always good. I often try different sauces on the menu, but my favorite, so far, has been the Hot BBQ.   Try this place if you're looking for great chicken fingers, wings, or a chicken sandwich. They also have burgers, but I haven't tried one yet.   The prices are so reasonable that it's hard to believe. The portions are larger than the price one pays."}
{"text":"We were just passing through and the yelp reviews lead us here. We ordered two kids meals, one # 2 and a chicken sandwich meal. They forgot to ring up my chicken sandwich meal and offered to make it when they brought the rest of the food to the table and we realized it was missing. I declined and am glad I did because that was more than enough food for the five of us. The fries are thin crispy and amazing! Seriously they just became the bar that all other fries are measured to. The chicken tasted good and was juicy but the coating wasn't very crispy. This just became my go to spot to stop on the way from Utah to Arizona. (No pictures of the food because one of my kids was on my phone.)"}
{"text":"Very delicious...very friendly staff and the garlic parmesean chicken fingers are to do for!"}
{"text":"What an awesome spot to eat.  Super clean with a friendly staff not to mention incredible food.  The burgers are perfect and the chicken is amazing.  The take out service is super fast and they make sure you get everything you need. The Chicken Shack is the perfect go to for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Had the 3 piece combo. Quality of product is excellent, chicken is tender and juicy, fries excellent as well. All came out hot and fresh. Service was exceptional-you can tell the ownership cares about their customers and the quality of their product. Highly recommend this location!"}
{"text":"A must try for every fried chicken lover. Generous portion, crunchy/tender delicious chicken, and an amazing sauce selection. Try the fry, \"damn\" hot, and spicy ranch sauces. Fries are crispy and salty scrumptious."}
{"text":"A must try for every fried chicken lover. Generous portion, crunchy/tender delicious chicken, and an amazing sauce selection. Try the fry, \"damn\" hot, and spicy ranch sauces. Fries are crispy and salty scrumptious."}
{"text":"First time. Picked up chicken strips and chili for lunch. Got the 5 piece chicken. Very good. I prefer traditional fried chicken with a good crust and bones...but this was excellent. At first I thought $7.00+ for a 'large' chili might be a bit too much...it didn't seem all that 'large'. But when I got it back to the office I was so impressed with the quality that the $$$$ seemed fair (you get what you pay for someone once said). Very good -- with beans -- but they are minimal. All in all it was great quality, and excellent, friendly service. Can't wait to try the wings and some of the sides."}
{"text":"I love Chicken Shack! The chicken and fries are delicious. My husband and I have ordered a regular/large fry and usually (I forget the exact amount) 8-10 tenders to share and it was plenty. We have been here twice, and I am a fan. The only thing is both times the service was ok. I felt like an outsider intruding or bothering the workers. If I asked a question I was kind of given a quick short answer like I should already know all this and be ready to go. I had to laugh but agree on the other reviewers comments of \"dont ask for a water cup!\" I legitimately drink water some times with my meals."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years, and service has reached such a low that I feel compelled to write a review about it. But first, the food:  The food is okay. People writing reviews about \"omg best chicken ever!\" are probably comparing it to McDonalds chicken nuggets. The tenders are fairly dry and the wings are not much better. Their BBQ sauce is actually pretty decent but the other ones I've had (ranch and bleu cheese) are bad.   The crux of my review is the customer service. A bad experience will sour my entire meal, no matter how good the food is. I feel like the owners have an ongoing contest to see how rudely their cashier can treat their customers while still staying in business. Every single time I come in I get the stink eye and get attitude from the cashiers. I mostly ignore it because my mom loves to get the food here so I bring her here, but after the way I was treated today I will absolutely not be coming back."}
{"text":"I have passed by this great small business numerous times this past few months.  I probably would have never stopped had it not been for the guides at Flightlinez telling me how much they loved this place.  We were on our way back from the Railroad Tunnel Hike and of course really hungry.  We pulled into the lot which reminds me of Sonic.  I at first thought it was a car hop place but that was just the way the parking is set up.   I imagine it used to be a car hop place years ago.      The inside is small with just a few tables.  It was clean but had the disarray look about it.  The young lady who took our order was really nice.  We took a couple of minutes to figure out what we wanted and she had showed great patience with us.  I was glad no one was behind us.  We choose medium wings, chicken strips, fires and a large chili to go. Our order came out super quick which was great!       The chicken strips were pretty large and a couple of them with fries where a meal.  The fries were shoestring size and really tasty.  We ordered a small fries but they filled the container they came in.   We got the garlic parmesan sauce and honey habanero to dip our strip in.  They were both very good and unique.  The Honey Habanero kind of sneaks up on you and was on the hot side but not above the heat line so every dip was a good as the first.  The Wings were for the wife who loved them.  I got here medium in heat and she said they were great but wanted the hot next time.      The chili was really good and had lots of meat.  It had a few beans in it which I prefer.  Meat was the main item which was pretty impressive.  The chicken strips had a light breading coating.  Unlike other places where breading is the main part that is not the case here.  The breading was tasty and the big meaty strips were awesome.  We bought 10 strips and 12 wings and it was 2 meals for the 3 of us.  Great food and a good price - what more could you ask for.  Thanks Flightlinez team for sharing this Gem with me!"}
{"text":"Great chicken great fries. A lot of cool sauces to choose from. The stag was cool and helpful for being a first timer to the place. Would recommend"}
{"text":"I tried the damn hot wings at a friends house recently and thought it would be something my boyfriend would like so I drove all the way there from summerlin. I ordered 25 wings but the cashier told me they can't do more than 5 damn hot when you do an order of 25. I found that to be odd but didn't really care so I proceeded to order other flavors to total 25. The cashier was nice and offered to give me an additional 5 sauces of damn hot since it was my first time in there. My name was called when my food was ready and I grabbed the large bag that they said was my food and I noticed another large bag next mine and asked if that was with my order. The cashier said \"no this is hers\" (the lady next to me) so I took my bag and left then proceeded to drive all the way back to summerlin. I get home to find out that they gave me the wrong sauces and the worst part of it all is that I didn't even get the Damn hot sauces that I went there for. Highly frustrating. I couldn't even confirm my order because they took my receipt and gave it to another employee instead of me for some reason. Overall the wings are decent especially when you get what you ordered but the staff needs to get their shit together. If you like getting your order right, order small and double check it. Apparently 4 or 5 different sauces is too much to handle."}
{"text":"Good food but store closes early? Showed up saturday night 10 minutes before closing.employee had the door open moping telling my self and another customer they closed at 8:30.the other customer said he phoned down and a staff member said they closed at 9! I personally went down because yelped told me it closed at 9! Whats going on?"}
{"text":"They're very slow.  Canes is better and right across the street.  Lol Dairy Queen is a few feet away, get tenders there!"}
{"text":"We were recommended this place and since we were on that side of town, we decided to try it. It's in one of those strip mall centers on the corner of Sunset Road. The reviews about this place being small are correct. There are only 6-4 top tables and 3-Deuce tables. The decor and cleanliness is very fitting for the name as it did remind me of a shack with it being small and had that \"dirty\" look. I'm not sure if it was the floor color or what but, you can decide from the pictures. I couldn't get the whole place because there were obviously people in here.We ordered the 5Finger,fries and drink combo, 10 Fingers and a 3 Finger & 3 Finger,fries and drink combo which all totaled about $30. From the reviews, I was excited to try it because my ultimate Favorite is still Raising Canes even over Chic-Fil-A... have yet to try PDQ. I must say that I was not impressed. The fingers were bland and the fries tasted like straight oil. Perhaps our chicken would've had flavor if I didn't ask for sauce on the side(another tip I got off of here) but, even with the sauce on top, I'm sorry but, it still only qualifies for a ranking of 3stars. On a good note, the fingers are a very good size hence, the reason why I'm giving 3 stars and not 2. I would be willing to give a 5 if this place were bigger, cleaner and tastier."}
{"text":"These wings are delicious! We had wings with a variety of sauces. The hot honey garlic is sweet and spicy. Lemon pepper is regular and the chipotle barbeque is also tasty. The best thing about these wings, served piping hot, is that that are delicious without sauce.   The shoestring fries are crisp and will seasoned.   The star was lost because the hamburger was over cooked. My 10 year old wouldn't eat it so you know it's bad. Still, this is the chicken shack and not the burger shack. Who orders a burger at a wing place?  Get here."}
{"text":"I'd have have to say, this is probably my favorite place to eat in Boulder City. I can't get enough of it. Much better than the Henderson location, the chicken is never dry, the fries are always hot, and the staff are awesomely friendly. It's my favorite place to go have a bite before the Eagles' football games. I live 40 minutes away from BC, and I'll make the drive, just to eat at Chicken Shack!!"}
{"text":"This is our go to spot after a fun day on the boat! The portions are so huge my husband and I usually share a 5 piece. They usually always give you an extra piece of chicken so it's really a 6 piece. Don't forget to get a stamp card!"}
{"text":"This was our first time trying The Chicken Shake and we loved everything. The Chicken was nice and juicy, the sides were great especially the beans. The best sauce is the spicy honey garlic, it was a favorite for all of us."}
{"text":"A young Rex...a young taught schoolboy Rex...was once a star athlete. I was good at all of the sports the other boys wished they were. I was great at shooting dice, 3 Card Monty, pick pocketing and loan sharking. I was the envy of my entire 3rd grade class. Very few kids that age can play the shell game on a street corner for 8 hours and then kneecap some deadbeat over a 20 dollar debt at night.  I was a machine...a well oiled, tight bodied machine. The girls...oh the girls...nap time was a special time. A young Rex surrounded by his prepubescent harem.  It was magical. I was on top of the world.  My aunt Eunice would see me come back with some old man's pension check, because he owed 3 weeks of the vig after betting on the Giants, she would beam with pride.  We would go to our special place...and then he would take me for food. I deserved it...believe me. She would buy me fried chicken. I loved it. It washed out the taste of low tide. Bribe sweet bribe. Bribed my silence.  As an older man I look back on those days and still cringe. Sure the money was good. Sure the chicken was good. The rest...not so much.  I tell this tale of woe and want for one reason...all of that great chicken was almost blotted out of existence from a combination of court ordered therapy, LSD, electroshock, and Kenny G Therapy...my own creation...not for the week of heart.  I discuss it in detail in \"Kenny G: How the Devil Gave Us Therapy.\"  Those great chicken dinners would be lost to the recesses of my mind...just flickering images...like the ones I see of me standing on top of a building, naked, wearing a beer hat and smoking a cigar...images of meaningful nonsense. That was until I went to the Chicken Shack. Oh, sweet Chicken Shack. Let me hold you. Let me kiss you. Let me call you aunt...wait...never mind.  Chicken Shack does what it does...and it does it amazingly! Chicken Shack chicken is never frozen. The breasts and the wings are huge...like Busty Dusty big. Ah, memories...I almost suffocated at a club in Pittsburgh once.   The 5 strip lunch/dinner is more than enough for the biggest eater.  It comes with fries and a drink for under 8 bucks.  Fountain drink for unlimited soda. I saw these two huge fat guys mowing down a 5 piece. They looked full. They looked content. They looked like they had hypertension. God Bless America. The wings are excellent but I recommend the strips. More meat. Tender. Juicy. Delicious. Same price.   The sauces. The sauces are key to a place like this. Like having weed on you when trying to sleep with Jennifer Aniston. Mandatory.  Well, Chicken Shack doesn't disappoint. Recently I had the special Habenero Honey. It was sweet. It was hot. It hurt a little bit after 4 pieces. It hurt the good way...like being dumped by Amanda Peet...that body can only keep you happy for a long time...then you are just praying for a stroke.  The BBQ sauce is excellent. The Garlic Parmesan sauce is absolutely amazing. The chili lime isn't very good, sorry. Too limey...like Hugh Grant.   If chicken isn't your thing...then you think that Rex will tear into you for going to THE CHICKEN SHACK...but no...not at all...they have a burger there that is amazing. A single. A double. A triple. You can add cheese and bacon. Yes...triple cheese and bacon.  Oh is it good...it's really good. I ate it. I cried. I ate it again. I cried harder. I threw a chair out the window. I ran.   They have an all you can eat chicken wing and 1 dollar beers. If that doesn't sound good to you then you are a loser. I say that with no hesitation. No remorse. No second guessing. You are the type of person who would hold up a bank but leave the stuff in the safe.  The atmosphere is great. They have funny slogans on the wall. Cute. Sickeningly cute. Rex is sarcastic. Rex hates it. Others will love it.  The bottom line is that this is obviously a family place run by people who actually care. Rex is very happy to find a local business that prides itself on quality and building an ongoing local relationship with customers. Nice owners. Great food. Local. Cheap. Quality.   When Rex dies please batter and deep fry him. He deserves the honor. Take a bite. Take a big bite. You love the way hate tastes."}

{"text":"chicken wings are very good, tenders are okay. Good sauces (especially garlic honey), great fries. Good service."}
{"text":"A huge amount of food for a relatively cheap price. But the tenders we had were on the dry side. I'll have to give this place another try and see if they redeem themselves. If it's good enough for chumlee, it's good enough for me"}
{"text":"Not too impressed, I ordered a 5 piece tenders and large chili fries. The strips were large but the chicken lacked flavor but luckily the sauces saved the day I got the creamy garlic parmesan sauce and honey mustard they were really good, tasted homemade, and definitely made with love. The large chili fries can feed two people or one very hungry person. The chili didn't really taste that good and the fries did not taste fresh. I am definitely sticking with canes for chicken tenders.  Maybe someday in the future I will stop by and order wings, maybe that is their specialty."}
{"text":"I love the chicken Shack the food is really good and is always hot and fresh!!! I come in all the time to the location in henderson. The young man at the counter is always so nice! I just like the chicken wings with ranch. I get the wings with hot buffalo sauce. My bkyfriend gets the hot bbq.  I wish the to go didnt come in Styrofoam thats my only pet peeve because it makes tje friws hard to eat"}

{"text":"Ow I love it when I have to work in Boulder city bc it's an excuse to come by here!! They have amazing chicken wings and nice things crispy fries. The wings are fried really crispy then rolled in whatever your favorite sauce ia. Mine is the sweet habnero or the Chipotle BBQ. Prices are are very reasonable and in my mind the chicken tenders blow canes out of the water as well. Place is kinda divy by the looks from the outside but the interior is clean and the staff is warm and welcoming and explains anything on the menu as well. A++"}
{"text":"This place is really great. Not only is the food great but the staff make you feel like a family Memeber. Like you're hanging out at your sisters house. Chicken was cooked to perfection.  This may be the place that keeps the location up and going. Every other place in this location has failed for one reason or another.  All locals know the place.  Love the nostalgia in the restaurant.  Got an extra license plate, bring in it.  They'd love to hang it.  Above all, it's a clean establishment.  Great job!!!"}
{"text":"First time at chicken shack. Ordered the wings combo. Wanted coke slaw instead of wings. Take out order. Got home just wings with the sauce no fries or coleslaw. The chicken was great. Service is great. Just need to check the order before it goes out. And. There was no ice in the drink machine. All said I will be back chicken is great."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a deep fried & finger-licken meal then this fried chicken was on point! The wings were equally scrumptious. There was a  good variety of different dipping sauces like jerk chicken and herbed parmesean that you could sprinkle over your meal. The haystack portion of french fries was also very yummy. They also had several good beers available which was one good reason to stay and eat there. We found that this meal is best eaten at the shack itself. Our take out was a bit soggy and cold by the time we got home."}
{"text":"I used to come by when this placed was called Chicken Bonz and the name had always fascinated me. So I decided to stop by with a couple friends and we were not disappointed.  The place definitely has that mom and pop feel to it. The walls are decorated by license plates and 'why did the chicken cross the road' jokes. They even have a couple of arcade machines if you get bored. The menu is pretty standard for a chicken place. They have wings, fingers, fries along with several sauces. They also had a burger, coleslaw, and some other stuff but I mean c'mon who gets the cheese burger and the chicken finger restaurant?  The fingers were great, juicy and moist and good size. The shoestrings fries were just like the ones you would find at other restaurants but a good addition to the meal. I had mine tossed in the hot bqq which had a perfect combo of spicyness and bbq flavor. The honey bbq and the lemon pepper are also great.   While I thought the food was great I did notice that the service was pretty slow. I understand they really focus on fresh food, but it should not take 25 minutes to get chicken fingers out. It's a fast food restaurant and even some sit-down places are quicker than that. I also think its a bit pricey for chicken fingers, a 5 finger combo is close to $10bux. Still def worth checking out if your into chicken."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 5 star review if they didn't use Postmates as their delivery service. I was able to make ONE single successful order though postmates but since that order, my cart will not clear. Because of that, I cannot make another order for delivery. I have tried emailing postmates a few times now and even called them. Each time, they give me the same useless solution. Uninstall/reinstall the app or click \"edit\". It still won't allow me to place another order. If Chicken Shack began delivering or changed their delivery service like EAT24 or BiteSquad,  which work flawlessly, I won't be able to eat there as often as I would like. This is the only negative. Their food is amazing and I wish I could have it delivered.... :-("}
{"text":"I stopped going to BWW's years ago when this place first opened on Sunset. This is the same great food in a better location. If you've never eaten here before, I suggest trying the both the wings and the tenders. My favorite sauces use to be a mix of honey BBQ and damn hot. But, now they have hot honey garlic that's become my new favorite."}
{"text":"I've always heard about Chicken Shack but there was never one close time. Now there is one right by my office and even better on my way home!!! Great wings and fingers.....I even liked the chili and potato salad!!! This will definitely be a stop more often!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for awhile. So I Tried it yeasterday. I ordered a 6 piece wing combo with fries and a drink,6 more wing and fries and a 5 piece chicken finger for $34.10. Seems like a lot of money. But for the amount of food it's not. The wings are huge and the chicken fingers are huge too. I could only eat 3 wings and half of my fries. The wings taste like chicken. I have had wings before that have no flavor. They are so good and crispy if you get certain ones. The people there are nice and friendly. I ordered for a take out when I got there. I waited for it. There were very fast making my food. It was hot. And the cook came out of the kitchen and gave me my food personally. I definitely will be back here to eat again. Great place!!"}
{"text":"The chicken was thick and juicy. (+) The fries were decent, I've had worse and better. (-) The dipping sauces I had was spicy BBQ and regular BBQ and both were amazingly great! (+) We ordered a 3 piece combo and a 5 piece. We received an extra chicken finger in both combos (10 pieces total) (++++++++++++++++)  Customer service was very nice friendly"}
{"text":"Really big juicy wings with a variety of sauce to choose from. A casual kick back place that's a good stop by for a good bite to eat. Great customer service. The place is very small and only a few tables. The place wasn't that clean, but wasn't filthy either. I will be going back. My kids loved those wings and fries."}
{"text":"I had the six piece chicken combo with sweet chili sauce. $9.59 Small cute and tidy place . You may not get the parking space you want because there are several other popular eateries in this complex. Customer service is friendly . Too may sauces to mention. Here's the basic cut to the chase review compared to those other chicken wing places - it seemed to me that chicken shack uses a better quality chicken and therefore the end product is a better tasting chicken . Also extra extra extra thanks for having wet towelettes to wipe your fingers . The other places don't offer those ."}
{"text":"Was there on August 23, 2015 on a Zip Line trip with FlightLinez and a dude there said we should try Chicken Shack. We paid him mind and actually were looking forward to lunch after an awesome time ziplinning. The chicken was juicy,moist,tender and flavorful. I wish we had one in Los Angeles.  If I return to Boulder City I'll be there for my chicken fingers!!! Great sauces had my eyes watering with such intense flavors. I love me some chicken shack!"}
{"text":"Avoid this place.  I've definitely had better. I was looking forward to this place, and it was a complete let-down. Yelp led me astray for the first time. So astray that I feel inspired to leave my two-cents.   The fries were soggy. I like a fry with a good bit of crisp, but without too much crunch where it is overcooked. These fries must have been sitting around for a long time. The chicken was terrible. For a place being named for their chicken and still being open, I'm surprised it lasted this long. The chicken fingers were just as soggy, the breading fell apart, and there was no seasoning. I can't believe I spent money on this.  The only thing this place has going for it are the jokes on the walls and its variety of amazing sauces, which had some kick!  You're better off with Raising Cane's. It's cheaper and better quality."}
{"text":"my foodie \"uncle\" recommended me here. I like it a lot. many sauce choices. fries are crunchy, wings and fingers are juicy and crunchy. just the way I like it. opens at 10. I came in before 11 and it's full of customers."}
{"text":"Nice location... Service was good but nothing major. From the look and smell of the garlic parmesan wings I was expecting greatness!! The crunch and seasoning on the wing is excellent! However, one bite of the chicken and you wonder what happened. There is no flavor in the actual chicken... Such a sad find. It doesn't take much to season chicken... If they did that it would put them above the national franchise. The fries are cut thinner then most places but are so good! My disappointment comes when the signature item lacks flavor. I'd eat there again but I will definitely be trying something else."}
{"text":"I really have to say that they have some great chicken and the customer service is really good and they have all kinds of different flavors of chicken and they can even make Cajun fries careful it's super hot but it really is good and I will definitely be back for more I also got the medium strips with some BBQ wings and they were both amazing I have to try other the next time. Definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"You won't be disappointed coming here. We had the chicken fingers, wings and fries with every imaginable dipping sauce there is mmmmmh. Service great and cozy don't pass by"}

{"text":"On our way to the Hoover Dam in Nevada, we came across The Chicken Shack. We decided to stop by to try something diffrent. We did not know what to expect, at first glance I was kinda worried about how clean it would be, but as soon as we walked in my worry went away. This place is SUPER clean!!! Restrooms are clean. The cashier is super friendly and very helpful. We told her it was our first time and she explained the menu.   The menu consists of mainly chicken fingers and fried wings. They also have chesseburger, chicken sandwhich, and salads. They have a variety of sauces and dressings. They offer beer and fountain drinks.   We ordered our food and sat at the front  patio. The food arraived very quickly. The portions are big. You defenetly get for what you pay for. Nice country music playing. Very good, I will be stopping by next time im in the area."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and they've always been very nice and fast. If there's a line it usually isn't for long because they're very prompt.  They have some cool menu options and the food tastes really good.  The only slight drawback is the size of the location.  It's intimate but small and the front cash area can get very congested.  I do suggest trying the Pitcher of beer and wings combo deal."}
{"text":"One of the most delicious chicken joints in Nevada! The staff is professional, helpful, and friendly. The place is small, and looks like an old fashioned fast food restaurant from the early 1900s. 30 minutes away from the city but totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Cool place, cool guys behind the counter.   Combo meals are a good deal for lunch. They have a good selection of dipping sauces and the containers are plenty big so it was more than enough for me. Chicken fingers are plump and tasty. Teeny tiny shoe string fries that I don't care for because I like steak fries much better, but I will admit they are tasty. Simple dining room to eat in and the counter guy even asked me how the food was and I gave him the international thumbs up. They play classic rock music which is amazing. This Chicken Shack rocks!! \"I'll be back\""}
{"text":"The did have shoestring fries and fry sauce...  and Alaskan Amber beer... all great starts... but at the end of the day the wings were at best average... I asked for Jamaican jerk on the side... they came out soaked in it... to their credit, they did bring me 6 more plain for free... Onto my next quest!!!"}
{"text":"My youngest son loves chicken wings.  Actually the whole family does.  We discovered this gem of a eatery via Yelp and visit every time we are in Vegas.  Even if we are not staying very close by.  Why?  Because the wings are plump, juicy and delicious. We had the sweet chile, honey bbq, teriyaki and buffalo medium.  Everytime we have been here, John was behind the counter and taking care of us.   Very friendly and patient and has great suggestions.  It is obvious from the steady flow of patrons that the wings are delicious.  We also had the shoestring fries and coleslaw.  Coleslaw was ice cold and kind of sweet but definitely great.  And the fries disappeared almost as fast as the wings.  I wasn't sure the 36 wings would feed the five of us but the wings are so big that we left full.  No leftovers.  My only comment would be that the orders had a much higher percentage of drummettes than wing sections.  I prefer the wing but I am guessing John could make that happen for me next time.  Worth the trip and forget about the decor.  The chicken is the draw here."}
{"text":"Ok, first off, the food is great! The chicken wings were really good, the sauce is tasty, and the fries are CRAZY GOOD! My only complaint is with the service.  They advertise being open until 9pm. My wife and I showed up October 31st @ 5:50pm and were told that they were closing in 10 minutes, so we would have to eat outside.  We agreed to this and then proceeded to watch multiple people get turned away, even though the open light was still on and the door was unlocked.  We could hear the employees talking about some Halloween party that they were wanting to go to, and it made us wonder if they were really supposed to be closing early, or if they were just taking advantage of the boss being away.  There was a sign on the door that asked patrons not to wear masks inside the store for Halloween which made us believe even more that this was not something that the owners were aware of. We sat outside for about an hour and watched numerous groups get turned away because the \"fryer was already turned off\" as the cashier would tell people, and then proceed to take the orders groups of 1 or 2. One lady who was turned away, was pretty upset, and she was talking to her husband, complaining about them supposedly closing, but saying that she overheard the people in the back talking about their Halloween party. Then another group that was turned away, said that they thought it was ridiculous that they were closing @ 6:30pm. I overheard them and said, \"That's funny, they told us 6!\" Another group was turned away shortly thereafter being told that the fryer was already turned off. Not 2 minutes later, a man and his wife walked in, ordered their food, and continued to eat their meal, inside. Some people were forced to eat in their cars, because there was no room @ the tables outside, and the staff kept telling people that they had to leave. The cashier came to the door as we were eating, and started to peel the sign off of the door, notifying customer about their mask policy. He looked over at me and said, \"I probably should lock the door huh?\" I said, \"Probably, unless you want more angry customers than you've already had so far tonight.\" My wife asked him if the owners were aware of their early closing, which he skirted the question by saying that it was a family run business that closes early for holidays, like Thanks Giving and Halloween.  I told him that this was the first business I've ever heard of that closes early for Halloween and he just kind of nervously chuckled and said, \"Yeah\" and then I told him that it might not be a bad Idea to turn off the Open sign, or put up a sign notifying customers of their change in business hours. My guess is that this was just a bunch of idiots, thinking that they were pulling a fast one, by coming up with a \"genius\" plan to close up shop early, so they could get to a partly. I know that I won't be going back, the next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Food was just ok. I used to go to Chicken Bonz I was told it was the same people. So we tried them out. Cashier was rude stopped helping us twice to take a phone order and then to talk to an employee. Customer service lacking. THEN if you order wings or fingers your order doesn't come with any ranch or sauce. You have to pay extra if you want dipping sauce. I've never heard of such a thing. I'm not asking for 5 just at least one since I'm paying $14 for an order of wings.  I was asked if for here or to go and why ask if you going to bring them out togo? Or maybe your just so rude you didn't listen to anything I said. Which was probably it. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Great and convenient location! Fast service and food portions are generous.  We loved the medium sauce on the wings. It was like at traditional buffalo sauce.  The honey mustard and barbecue sauces were terrific on the tenders. The wings were my fave: crispy, plump and seasoned perfectly."}
{"text":"This is my first time trying the chicken shack and was not disappointed! Fresh tender and juicy chicken strips with killer dipping sauces is the best way to describe my eating experience. The staff was on point and recommended some really good dipping sauces to try. Considering chicken shack are chicken specialists, I would say they have perfected the chicken and fry basket game! This is a must try if you love Canes or Zaxbys will definitely be back"}
{"text":"For a real treat after your visit to Hoover Dam stop at the Chicken Shack in Boulder City, NV. Perfectly Chrispy juicy tenders with wide bevy of choices for dipping. Plenty of skinny fries with fry sauce!"}
{"text":"DO NOT JUST DRIVE PAST THIS PLACE!! Wow! Their chicken strips are to die for, their sauce selection literally has something for anyone, and they are all super tasty. (Well, judging from the 5 I tried, I'm guessing the other 20 are equally amazing) Very friendly staff and owners, who you can tell take pride in the service and product that they provide. Today was my first time going in, but you can be assured that I will be back often."}
{"text":"I usually would go to the Henderson location and order fingers only so I was super stoked that they opened one nearby my house, However, when I went to this location, I noticed that they raised the menu prices so that was a bummer. I took my family with me and told my husband he would love this place (He's a wing guy) he was so disappointed that the wings were breaded and the chicken fingers were so dry and tough, The Fries were a bit salty as well."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today with friend and wife. Great service. Very friendly staff.   Seating area a little small  Food was amazing. Wife and I both had the #4 - wings and fingers combo. Habanero Honey sauce is good mix of sweet and heat."}
{"text":"I love this Chicken Shack.  So happy that we found this hidden gem.  We have been coming here several times now and every time the food is excellent. Chickens are not salty nor greasy. It's juicy and tasty. Perfect every time. I kind of feeling healthy eating this fried food with no guilt. A big plus is that the owner is super friendly. I love coming here when I feel welcomed every time.   I highly recommend this place for fried chicken fingers and chicken wings. I always drive extra distance to get here and skip all other chicken places near me."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch as I was up the road for training. What an amazing place to grab a quick bite. Chicken was cooked to perfection and the shoestring French fries are the best I have ever had (and I have been all over the country). Will definitely make a return trip to this place. My only complaint is that the music is so loud it is hard to hear your order called or carry on a simple conversation."}
{"text":"Great hang out place! You have to try all the sauces every time u visit !! They have sooo many different flavors it's crazy!!!  Their fingers were juicy, tender and fresh and I love how big it is and it actually top off the raising canes !! Friendly staffs and the management team !!! If you want to get some good chicken fingers and wings also like to see some friendly faces and smiles this is the place!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. First went w some other families and kids after a b day party that was lacking in the food dept. We had boneless wings and the hot sauce is fantastic. The chicken and prep are fresh which is a rarity. And they have beer!   Reasonably priced for the quality. Got them for the adults @ my kid's 6th bday and was a hit. Only wish they had an outlet on my side of town."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan. Stopped in passing through town craving some wings. The portions were huge. Salad, fries, wings, all of it was huge.  The wings themselves were not great. The wings were really big which made them not taste as good. In my opinion, good wings need to be smaller, that way you get more of the sauce to wing ratio. Not only that, they tasted old. Not impressed, should've gone to BWW."}
{"text":"I drove past this place and decided to stop in and give it a try.  The menu is basically wings, chicken strips, or larger portions by the piece.  I decided on the 3-piece chicken strip meal and added a side of cole slaw.   The strips were HUGE!  The meal included a mound of straw-thin fries and a soda.  The small side of slaw was much larger than I expected.  Portion size would earn 5 stars!    The cole slaw was decent.  Not great, but better than many I've tried at other chicken joints.  I prefer a creamy, sweet slaw.  This was a bit runny with a little too much pepper for my taste.  But again, not bad.  3 stars for the slaw.  I really enjoyed the fries, but they are almost too thin.  4 stars  Now for the chicken strips...HUGE size!  Unfortunately, they don't have any flavor really.  The breading could be great with some spices thrown in, but as it is, it's just a crunchy coating of blandness.  2.5 stars  Considering that chicken is the main attraction here, I can't bring myself to give more than 3 stars for the entire meal.  Apparently, the Chicken Shack is under new management.  I might give it a month or so and try it again."}
{"text":"When I found out that they opened another location closer to me, I knew I had to check this place out. I got the 5 piece chicken tender combo with two sauces (honey bbq and creamy garlic parmesan).  I was disappointed that the fries I got was all soggy and oily. For those of you who read my other reviews, this is one of my biggest pet peeves. I am not sure if this is just the way they make their fries or if this was a bad batch. If I'm going to eat something unhealthy, it might as well be a good experience! I ended up just eating a few of the fries before I decided to throw them all out (what a waste of money!). The chicken tenders themselves were pretty good. I really enjoyed the honey bbq sauce and it's nice how the chicken is pretty juicy. One thing to note is that the batter isn't as crispy as places like Raising Canes or as flavorful as Popeye's. This basically means you're pretty dependent on the sauces for flavor.   Overall, this place is just okay. I don't think I'll be coming back unless my friends really want to check this place out. I would recommend just going to Canes or BWW."}
{"text":"Might be the best wings in town!!! Don't let the looks fool you. Yes it's a small greasy kind of a hole in the wall chicken shop, but it's good!!! Kind of place that the smell is in your clothes when you leave. Flavors are all right on, chicken is non-greasy and crispy. They even have PBR on tap. Garlic parm is my fav!!!"}
{"text":"The best chicken tenders hands down. I love the honey bbq sauce and the fries are amazing. Everyone should try this place at least once."}
{"text":"Hubby wanted wings so he yelped and found this place.  This is located close to the Galaxy Theater in Henderson, where we had just watched Ant Man an hour prior...  This is a small shop with 7 tables (2-6 tops), and a couple of more tables outside.  The wings are battered fried and you can select the seasoning you want on them.  6 wings, fries, and a drink is $8 and another $.50 for the sauce.  The wings are big (drumsticks and flats).  Hubby thought they were good, I thought they were ok.  My favorite is still Wingstop.  Would I come back, meh...it was ok."}
{"text":"Really awesome chicken! Perfectly cooked and the fries are to die for! If you are going to binge on fried food, this is the place to do it.  The people working there are great too. My kid had a super weird food request and the cook did it exactly the way my child wanted it. Must try!!!"}
{"text":"This is a favorite place for me and my family to enjoy chicken , chili cheese fries , and triple stacked burgers.. They have alot of sauces for the chicken.."}
{"text":"We've been a few times. Love the \"Happy Hour\" Special: 12 wings (one sauce choice, 1lb of fries and a pitcher of beer for $16.99. Chicken is crispy (we get our sauce on the side), fries are kinda thin for my liking but tasty none the less.   Only concern...last weekend (Saturday 10/29) it made my husband sick. I dont think we will be back for a while."}
{"text":"we came here after hiking today. I like their outdoor seatings. Inside, the walls are decorated with license plates from different states. It has a pretty cool feel to the place, but it can get crowded given the fact that it is small place.  We ordered the 25 pieces wings for $24.49 with Spicy blue cheese sauce. The sauces actually comes separately, I thought it would be mixed in. Anyways, they came out very crispy and the size is big.   They also have on the menu- chicken fingers, burgers, a Shack salad, sides like barbecue baked beans, macaroni salad and veggie sticks, plus a long list of sauces for the chicken including mild, medium, hot, damn hot, BBQ hot BBQ honey, BBQ teriyaki, hot teriyaki, sweet chili, chili, lime, garlic parmesan, lemon pepper, and habanero honey."}
{"text":"I'm surprised I've never reviewed this place myself  I've been coming here for the last 7 years when it was originally called \"chicken bonz\". To say the least, it was some of the best fingers you could get over here. There was a change in ownership and they renamed the place \"chicken shack\". Didn't think it'd keep up with a name change since it was so known with the bonz, but they never missed a beat!   Pros: 11$ and under for any combo (8$ for the 3 finger)           Friendly environment and nice wall decor           Good customer service!  Cons: sometimes the tables could be messy            Overall, this place is a gold mine and an awesome place for chicken and more! If you're ever around Sunset and Mountain vista, look no further than the Shack!"}
{"text":"This is the best chicken fingers and wings in town. They also have the best ranch sauce staff are nice, especially the cook the mexican guy very welcoming and with good character"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Nice size wings, shoestring fries, choice of different sauces, they give you the option to have them prepared with or sauce on the side. Never disappointed when I go, sometimes the line can be long."}
{"text":"Stopped here on our way back from Lake Mead. Seriously great food in an old-fashion setting. Small diner with big taste! We got the chicken finger combo and it was wonderful. The fries and chicken were crisp and very flavorful. Highly recommend for a well priced excellent bite!"}
{"text":"Had some honey BBQ chicken fingers and fries. They were a bit over cooked which made them very dry. The fries here are good but fries alone are not going to make me return."}
{"text":"Some of the best wings in Henderson, and the best take-out wings I've ever had.   They are cooked perfectly and their sauces are delicious. My favorites are the honey habanero, Hot, spicy teriyaki and sweet chili.   Shoe string fries are addictive, how do they make them so good ?!? Dip them in their crack sauce, I mean honey mustard and OMG. I literally have to throw them away to stop eating them. Their coleslaw is also really good.   So why 4 stars?  They charge you for sauce ?! I have never had wings that don't come with Blue cheese ( ranch for the west coasters) on the side. It's annoying is all it is.  No celery and carrots either?! This you also have to pay for. We always pay extra for these things because you're eating wings and these items are necessities. For the cost you would think it would be built into the price.   I would come here more often if it wasn't for the things mentioned above. Other than that, you won't be dissaointed."}
{"text":"Can I give this place more stars???  I went there hungry ordered 6 hot wings, fries, potato salad and a drink.   I barely ate my potato salad I was stuffed.  The wings are huge.  They aren't your typical Hooters, BWW, major chain wings.  So good.  I will definitely go back again.  It's my new wings place.  They also give a 10% discount on days when the Golden Knights are playing and you are wearing a Golden Knights shirt."}
{"text":"I really liked the concept. The honey BBQ sauce seems like it's made with real honey so it was a good idea. However the chicken fingers were not cooked to perfection. The meat tasted over cooked and dry. At least raising canes cooks their chicken perfect almost every time so if they can master their cooking game it would be a 5."}
{"text":"Excellent !  New !  Quality chicken and fabulous customer service! Everyone is friendly and  Helpful - all of staff and the owner ! I have been 5 times since they opened  A life saver for good fast take out ! Laurel B"}
{"text":"FINALLY a Chicken Shack on the southwest side of town (not in Henderson). Happy to report they still have the same high level of quality as the original. Best fingers in town and some very good fries as well. Try the mild and medium sauces. They're fantastic!"}
{"text":"So very happy that they have location 5 minutes from house. Now I can have them more than just only when I go to Boulder City"}
{"text":"My second time here and the chicken is wonderful crispy and juicy with flavor. Wish I lived closer would come back more!"}
{"text":"great place to stop and eat while going to/from vegas. Excellent wing sauces and fries."}
{"text":"Was skeptical about trying this place at first. Tried it and it was ok. I got the number 4 which is 3 wings, 3tenders, fries and drink. Simple meal to start off with a new restaurant . The fries were good. The chicken was juicy but I feel as tho they could cook their chicken wings and tenders just a bit longer, give it that crisp. And it could use some more seasoning, wasn't impressed with the seasoning on the food at all. So decent spot but it won't be somewhere that I'd set out to go to in future unless by passing."}
{"text":"Love this place! My suggestion is EAT IT THERE, usually by the time you get home (even living in boulder) your french fries will be soggy. I usually order just the chicken and fries, great prices too!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the past few years whenever I need my wing fix. Their wings are delicious, but I always opt for their strips just for the mere fact that I never like getting my hands dirty.  I usually order the combo, their fries are so yummy and their wing portions are huge - I can always get away with just three pieces to feel full.  Lemon pepper is usually my go-to flavor but they've got many others to choose from, all of which are just as good.  Definitely better than all the other wing chains in the city."}
{"text":"Hands down the best wings and fingers I had here in vegas! Wish we could bring this place to Texas!"}
{"text":"I had been looking foreword to this location opening for quite some time ever since first seeing the sign on the road for coming soon.  They exceeded all of my expectations with friendly staff, food quality, and getting it incredibly quickly.   I'm very familiar with the sunset location and how busy they are, so walking right up to the register and ordering and receiving my food in 10 mins time was an incredible accomplishment.  Food is incredibly amazing and as I've said, the staff is very friendly. Would highly suggest anyone to check out this place"}
{"text":"Talk about some amazing chicken wings, this place has it!  We had the medium, hot and honey habanero and all were out of this world! The wings were cooked to perfection the staff was excellent and the fries are just like I like them. The home made dips were also all very good! I would give it five stars if it was a five star type of place, but this is as good as it gets in dining like this! Next time I am going to try the extra hot as I like things very spicy, and the normal hot wasn't super hot. Also the hone habanero isn't very spicy but is sweet and spicy and very good. Also the garlic parmesan is outstanding, but in wings I do like spicy."}
{"text":"Had a very enjoyable experience at The Chicken Shack. The food was quick to be served and tasted great! Not to mention the service was an A+!"}
{"text":"We pass by this place every time we head to Boulder City for a relaxing day but never really concidered eating there until yesterday. After seeing the great Yelp reviews, we decide to try it. We were not disappointed! I had the #1 (6 wings, fries and a drink) with \"medium\" sauce. Not only were the wings big but I got 7 wings in my basket. The wings have a very light flour dredge ans nicely sauced. The shoestring fries were very crispy but not overcooked at all and nothing was greasy. Only thing I saw missing was a selection of \"good\" beer but they did have some Bud products. I decided to hold off until we got to Boulder Dam Brewing."}
{"text":"Food was life changing according to my 18 year old son - he had to order another chicken sandwich before even finishing the first. Meals are huge - fries were awesome too! Ranch was great and BBQ sauce was the best. Great place to stop after the Hoover Dam. Owners were very nice. Old facilities, but still HIGHLY recommended!"}
{"text":"I just came back from out of the country and honestly, I couldn't wait to come back to Vegas just so I can stop by one of my favorite places in the city.   By far, the best fried chicken (both wings and strips) I've had.  Tried a couple of other places and it just doesn't compare: the flavors, the texture, the size... Mmmmm-mmmm!!!! (smacking my lips)  What also gives it the edge are the shoestring french fry combination, it brings out that crunch that I had been looking for at the other chicken wings/strip spots.  The serving size is huge, I usually split a combo with a friend and that tends to be enough for me.  For those with larger appetites, don't worry, this place won't disappoint.  BIG Thumbs up!  The service is great, everyone there are friendly. Cute little spot that gets busy with a diverse crowd of patrons. The only complaint I have is during the times I've dined in, I can't help but notice how dirty the place is (the walls are friggin' gross as it's covered with dust and grease). As much as I enjoy the food when I dine there, the walls can be distracting.  Other than that, this place has great food (5 stars) and great service (5 stars)... just wish it was a bit more tidy (3.0). Overall, 4.3 stars in my book"}
{"text":"Wife and I live close by and come here two or three times a month. We always get the combo #2 and #3. I've heard their burgers are pretty good but we can't seem to get away from the chicken! They've got a great selection of sauces to go with the chicken if you're into that. My wife only does ketchup and I go with the chili/lime sauce. You'll either love or hate the chili/lime sauce. If you get anything to go I'd suggest venting/opening the to-go box a little when in transit because the contents will get pretty soggy. Venting won't guarantee it'll stay 100% crispy but it'll help a little."}
{"text":"When you walk in and view the menu, you think you are in \"Chicken Heaven\". There are a variety of flavors and various seasonings you can choose for your fries. However, I was not impressed. I ordered the chicken wing and chicken strip meal with a side of fries. The chicken was cooked to a golden crisp and served hot. I ordered the garlic Parmesan, and thought it was waay too salty. Also, a few of my pieces of chicken were undercooked. The restaurant is small, so I had to get my food to go. I have heard mixed reviews and though my experience was not the greatest, I am willing to give Chicken Shack a second chance."}
{"text":"The sides were even better than the chicken! And the chicken was incredible! 5 stars! Highly recommend the beans. New location by kohls - valle verde / 215"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time the other day ordered a combo of chicken wings and tenders with French fries and a drink. Took about 8min or less. Chicken fingers were probably one of the best I've had ! They're so juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. The mild sauce was great in flavor. I actually like the really thin French fries. We'll definitely be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try this place. Found the chicken to be good, but the portions excessive, the dipping sauces I tried, painfully unappetizing. All in all, I left half my order uneaten, and regretted my visit."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! Driving thru from Lake Mead back to Cali and thankfully stopped here. Food is awesome and service is just as great. I will stop here anytime I'm in the area and everyone else should do themselves a favor and do the same. 'Best chicken fingers since birth' -my boyfriend lol but really, so great!!"}
{"text":"I'm a native from California but my grandma stays down the street and she loves to eat here. we just got a lot of chicken and I must say it was pretty good big pieces and I will be visiting soon!"}
{"text":"Love it! Chicken fingers are crispy and juicy, and come out in less than 5 minutes. The shoestring fries are absolutely fantastic- crispy and perfectly seasoned. Management is super friendly. My boyfriend and i both got a 3 piece with fries each, and left with leftovers. Great price, great food. Will definitely be back to try out all the different sauces!"}
{"text":"Ok so far the best chicken I've had in a very long time!!! The service was great..... The wait time was short. The establishment was very neat and clean. I'm in love"}
{"text":"We spent a couple hours at the Hoover Dam and decided it was lunch time. We were on the way to Vegas and figured we'd find something. There were several chain places and a number of local places, but this one sounded promising since we were in the mood for chicken anyhow. Admittedly the outside didn't inspire confidence but that hasn't stopped us before. Sometimes the best places look unassuming, and this is no different.  The interior is decorated with license plates form all over the US, which gives it that kitschy feel, especially fun for a road trip. She got some chicken tenders, but I love me some wings so I got wings and tenders. She chose the garlic parmesan sauce and I got the honey bbq.  The meals came with shoestring fries and a drink. The tenders were tender and juicy and fresh and hot, the wings were excellent, and the fries? Perfect. I'm not a big fan of the shoestrings but these were seasoned wonderfully and just crispy enough without being overdone. All at a reasonable price. And the best part is that we didn't have a long wait like at some places.  If you're ever traveling through or even close to Boulder City, you simply have to check out The Chicken Shack. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Place was good enough that i'd come back. Chicken was just a little salty. Really enjoyed the fries with that fry sauce. The dude who was runnin the desk seemed like good people, other than being a Cubs fan lol. Gotta support local mom and pop joints like this though!"}
{"text":"Really really good chicken fingers! Nice sauce selections and I like the menu variety. Burgers here are great...thin and great beef burger flavor...and on an onion roll.  Service is fast and the staff behind the counter are friendly and have a sense if humor. Great find just beware...hard to get a parking spot."}
{"text":"Glad to see this place finally open! Just as good as all the rest. Wish the parking was a bit more thoughtful as you park around the side of the building unless you're handicapped but once inside its good and clean, nice staff, and great fresh food. Great place to stop in if you are getting your oil changed or a car washed nearby. Go with the chicken. Garlic flavors are great-garlic parm and honey garlic are perfect. Shoestring fries get high praise from me too. Just all around exactly what you want from a wing joint. Sooo much better than wing-stop. Don't forget the ranch and fry sauce!"}
{"text":"Chicken tenders are awesome! I love all the sauces that come with it as well. The prices aren't that bad especially on how good the tenders taste. I really loved the service, thank you(: I wish there was a chicken shack closer to my area, the drive down to Henderson side is too far.."}
{"text":"I thought the comments \"chicken on steroids\" and \"unusually plump\" were funny,,,, and yet true!  It is plump n tender, batter can be a bit more separated but overall a good chicken strip.  Habanero honey sauce is tasty, tried a few other sauces but they were ehhhh... U gotta find your own sauce! Cole slaw was a bit below KFC level, a bit soggy and minced, they do have $1 drafts! (12oz) For 5.95 you get 3 strips, fries n soda, not a bad deal...   And free chicken quotes on the walls...."}
{"text":"Located near the intersection of Sunset Rd. and Mountain Vista, which I like to think of as \"old Green Valley.\" This place is definitely a beaut that contributes to the other mom and pop owned places in the area. Chicken Shack was a typical eating spot for me while I was attending USN because my classmates and I would come here during our lunch breaks or after school before we would get our study on. And yes, all the raving reviews are correct. From what I've tired, probably the best chicken wings in LV, so this place is a MUST TRY!   I've noticed that I am a tough critic when it comes to the breading because Raising Canes is a little thin, while KFC is so thick I just opt to peel all the breading off. However, Chicken Shack has the perfect amount of thickness and also has nice crispy texture. Seasoned very well and they offer different types of flavors too like Wing Stop or BBW. The fries are also delish, thinly cut with extra crispies (almost the same as Yard House fries). They also have an all you can eat chicken option for $12.99, but I don't exactly know what it comes with. But I found that interesting because I've never seen such a thing at a chicken place. The only down side is you have to pay extra for ranch or blue cheese, which in my opinion kinda sucks.   I really like the mom and pop vibe of this place with the friendly staff and decorations.They even have their specials written on a chalk board. All of it really makes everyone feel welcomed."}
{"text":"Love the quality of their food...chicken tenders were outstanding...the fries are excellent."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place. They continue to consistently improve with their service and quality of food and it keeps me coming back every week. It is a little pricey, don't get me wrong, but it's so damn worth it. The wings are incredible as compared to BWW, these wings are jusr hearty, crispy, and fill you more. The sauces are sweet and define that guilty pleasure. I tend to get a #1 Combo- 6 wings,fries, and drink. I split the wings with Hot Honey Garlic and Mild. You can get sauce on the side or on the wings----The wetter the better. The chicken tenders deliver as well, lightly breaded with meat that is whole and juicy. The manager at this location is awesome too. Very friendly staff. My only complaint would be is that the Large Ranch side doesn't give you enough. I feel like every time I go there the ranch keeps getting lower in that container! But, nevertheless, this is my spot. 5 all day, son."}
{"text":"Loved this place!  Today Friday 30 2:00 pm the cashier that took our order was just the nicest person I've ever met.  Fingers, wings and fries were just BOMB'  I'm giving a \"I'll come back\"  Price isn't bad at all.. paid $11 for my order and my boyfriend and I were able to both eat from the same plate!   Omg, I'm just so happy we've found this place!  Even better than Buffalo Wild Wings.   Xoxo"}
{"text":"We like Raising Canes.  We thought it was the best.....UNTIL...... we had Chicken Shack.  Their fingers are much larger than Canes.  So tender and juicy.  They are served to order and so hot you must let them cool a bit before you can eat them.  Chicken Shack has so many sauces to offer for your strips.  I wish we had a Chicken Shack in Tempe.  If we are back in the area visiting, we will stop here again."}
{"text":"In my opinion, BETTER than Canes! Only we need one on the opposite side of town!"}
{"text":"words of wisdom:   if you are heading out of vegas, and need to run through boulder city......do not leave without stopping for some chicken fingers!!!!   you will thank me later!!!   fyi - the spicy blue cheese is to die for!!!"}
{"text":"I was really hoping to find a suitable replacement for WingStop, since the closest one to us is across town. WingStop back in Cali was my favorite go to spot for crispy well seasoned wings, but I have yet to find a place out here in Henderson near home that can compare. I ordered the #4 which comes with 3 boneless wings and 3 regular wings all in the Lemon Pepper flavor. The fries are pretty tasty - well seasoned super thin shoe string fries, but the wings were too much on the salty side compared to what I'm used to getting with WingStop's lemon pepper wings. Plus, as one Yelper pointed out, they keep their back door open, which you can clearly see from the ordering counter.  That somewhat worries me, for obvious health hazard reasons.... The place is real small, untidy and not as inviting as some describe it to be. It was an okay visit, but I'd rather go elsewhere - even contemplating just sucking it up and travelling across town to get my WingStop fix."}
{"text":"Good price and good fried  chicken. If you're in the area and looking for a quick bite they fit the bill. Price is right for what you get. A little on the bland side but not too bad. It's fast fried chicken don't go in expecting a whole lot. Lol"}
{"text":"Visiting Las Vegas for a basketball tournament with my boyfriend and his team! We came here and it was amazing! I was not disappointed. My boyfriend and i both got the chicken sandwich with bacon! The sand which was made up of 3 large chicken strips! A large amount of food & For both meals, fries & two sodas + a small tip it was less that 23$ in total. The gentleman at the register was amazing with customer service. He acknowledged that we had never been here and was great at recommending options. Although it was a little messy from the rush and the tabletops were a little sticky... my overall experience here was good! Great food and customer service! I definitely enjoyed my visit. Would recommend to others & come back!"}
{"text":"Our food was ok. We ordered a 10 piece chicken strip with fries and some wings. The strips were thick and juicy but lacked flavor. The sauces were pretty tasty though... overall I probably would choose another chicken place like canes."}
{"text":"Best chicken and great service!  Always better to call in order for even quicker check out!  I always get the honey BBQ wings, but my son loves the mild chicken fingers.  The ranch is the best too!!!"}
{"text":"This place is the business! Their chicken is always hot, fresh and above all crispy. Not to mention their array of tasty sauces to smother your chicken in, but you can also get sauce on the side for you dippers. Not a huge fan of the shoe-string fry. I like my potatoes like how I like my women, with a little more meat on them ya feel. The frys weren't bad by any means though. They also have burgers which I haven't got around to will definitely be back to try though!"}
{"text":"The food here is wonderful. We were pleasantly surprised with this place. It was very clean and the food was great. The wings were awesome especially with the spicy blue cheese. Ranch dressing was good too."}
{"text":"I'm looking forward to going back to this restaurant on this trip to Vegas. It was so good and affordable last time I had it a cookie years ago."}
{"text":"First I went in to grab a menu, the gentleman who greeted me was wearing a lakers beanie and was very polite and helpful. I had never heard of the place so I wanted to investigate. After some deliberation, I decided to go back in and order. Again, the lakers beanie guy was there and asked what I wanted. I ordered a 5 piece but changed to a 10 piece. At this point, the computer was giving him some trouble so he asked a lady to come help. She was wearing a baseball cap. While she was fixing the order I asked her a couple questions about the sauces and what type of sauce went on the hot wings and such, to my surprise she replied rather rudely. I had never been to the restaurant before so I figured they were reasonable questions but to her it seemed like I was really interfering with her daily routine. Other than the rudeness from the baseball cap wearing female, I felt goods about this place. The chicken strips were great. I got 5 in medium sauce and 5 plain along with a ranch and spicy ranch. The 5 tossed in the sauce were better overall bur if if you want plain strips i wouldn't hesitate. Also, there are some funny quotes on the wall. I look forward to going back and trying some of the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"First time ordering from this place. Overall I'll rate The Chicken Shack a \"B\" ordered the basic 5 piece chicken fingers. I was under the impression that the chicken itself would be seasoned, since it was being fried so without the dipping sauce which was amazing (Honey Garlic) the chicken would've been bland. The chicken was also a little oily as well,but I'm willing to give this place another spin."}
{"text":"My first impression was does anyone clean the tables or change the garbage? I heard the chicken was good so I proceeded to give it a try. I was not impressed. The staff had a whatever attitude and when I asked if they could wipe down the filthy table I got a annoyed ok. After ordering quite a bit of food I asked for a soda and a cup for water. Well that was a mistake as the young man behind the counter said NO....I could buy a bottle of water because too many people are taking soda instead of water. Did he just say I was going to steal soda????? Ok well on that note I replied I bought a soda but I'd like a cup of water for my medication....again a resounding no. Even if the chicken was great WHICH IT IS NOT I would NEVER step foot back in this filthy place again. Keep your dirty restaurant, poor service and water!!"}
{"text":"Brought the kids here for lunch. Stop everytime we come to Vegas. Would have given 5 stars but for the first time we had a rude staff. I was extremely surprised by this. Ordered the Shake Pack with potato salad and baked beans. The food was amazing as always."}
{"text":"This is probably my new favorite chicken spot! Chicken is tender and lightly breaded. They don't douse your food in sauce (unless asked) and have the option of fingers or wings. Get the #4 if you want both !"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and my boyfriend comes here semi regularly. The staff is always super nice and they tend to remember people well.  I love the chicken fingers here. They don't have a ton of breading on it which is how I like them. The fingers are huge. A 5 piece is enough for both my boyfriend and I.  We haven't tried the wings yet but plan to so."}
{"text":"First time going here yesterday. This place offers chicken tenders, chicken wings, and other dishes such as chili, burgers, chicken sandwich, and salads as well. Located on rainbow and Tropicana. The place was super clean. Went with the combination chicken tender basket with fries. They make their fries shoestring style, and you had a choice of sauce on the side. Chicken you can get regular battered, or with your choice of sauce on top. The tenders and fries came it crispy, with the chicken specifically battered great. Paired it with ranch, my bf went with the fry sauce (mayo and ketchup combined, soo good!!) service was friendly. They also have customer rewards, make sure to grab a card at the cashier- buy 10 get a meal free."}
{"text":"Sometimes their chicken can get slightly over cooked causing them to be dru, but it doesn't happen very often.  Their fries are my favorite especially with their garlic parm sauce!"}
{"text":"Hands down, one of the best places to eat after seeing the Hoover Dam. Best wings and fingers to taste like your grandmother fried up on a Sunday afternoon. To go along with it, you can taste the love in the food with the hospitable staff!"}
{"text":"It's about time I write a review for this place. I've been coming here for a couple years and I haven't regretted it even once. I personally get the #2 combo all the time. The chicken fingers are juicy and have a light crispy golden crunch that make them fantastic. I usually get them to go but the customer service is always spot on with quick and nice workers."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never reviewed this place. Chicken shack is my spot! I love hot wings but I love lightly breaded plain chicken wings with sauce on the side better!  Chicken shack serves wings, tenders, chili, beer, and crack fries. Their wings and tenders are lightly floured and are also huge. I always get the wing, fingers, fries, and soda combo. I think it's a #4. It comes with 3 wings 3 fingers, their shoe stringish fries, and a soda. I believe this combo is $8.95. It is A LOT of food. Last night the guy even gave me an extra wing AND finger. Kudos! I ended up taking four pieces of chicken home.  For flavor recommendations I suggest the lemon pepper or garlic parm POWDER flavoring or the hot sauce. The hot sauce had the perfect amount of heat with a slight sweet note that I adore.  I love my sauce on the side when I eat chicken wings and imagine having these breaded wings thrown into sauces would be too much.  They get REALLY busy, but the food comes out quickly. I think for the freshness and taste that the prices are fair as they do give you a lot of food. My only gripe is that you might have to clean the table you want on your own as the turn around is quick and there isn't always someone to wipe it down."}
{"text":"Best chicken fingers I have ever had!  Great quality boneless chicken breast with a wide selection of dipping sauces to choose from.  The service is great and the food comes out fresh and hot!  Do yourself a favor and give this place a try!  You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"best wings in Las Vegas period...all the sauces are fresh and there is alot of variety. There's always great customer service and you can get a pitcher of beer for like 8$ what more do u want in life"}
{"text":"Food is delicious!!! Best chicken fingers I've ever had. The staff was amazing and even made my dogs feel welcome after a long hike offering them water and grilled chicken. The food beat our expectations would definitely come back!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat!! Have been eating here since High School and loved every single time I've gone. The people are so sweet and kind but the food is even better! I love bringing my friends from out of town here to try the spectacular chicken!"}
{"text":"Great chicken! Super nice people. Servings are the way it should be. Thanks for the great meal and the tips on the Grand Canyon. See you next time."}
{"text":"Best chicken strips EVER!!! My favorite sauce is the honey mustard! I could eat here every night!!!"}
{"text":"I think I've been here enough times that I should finally be giving it a rating.  So far, I've pretty much only had fingers and fries combos. Three fingers is the right size if you're alone, unless you're super hungry. Five is a bit high unless you're sharing with a friend or two, Sometimes, they'll throw in an extra finger if they think that your pieces are a little small.  I have to start with the fries. They are the best shoestring fries I've had anywhere. There's just something to the flavor that draws you in. Don't put ketchup on them though. I don't know why, but that destroys the flavor for me. You can dip them in sauces (see below).  And of course, the chicken fingers are the main point of the restaurant. They are large. They are crunchy. They are tender. And they come with dry or wet sauces (note: get wet sauces on the side if you don't want to destroy the crunchy texture of the fingers). Come back multiple times and try many sauces.  I have no darn clue why there isn't a lemon-lime soda option here. That's the only negative that I have to share. I would probably just get a small cup for water if I could, but a drink comes with the combo."}
{"text":"What a tragedy to lose one of the more creative restaurants in Henderson. What a treat to have it replaced by another outpost of one of my favorites.  Chicken Shack has been a favorite of mine for years. I was surprised to learn not long ago that they've actually expanded out of state, even as far north as Washington. Their newest location, however, is in the same town as the original location - barely over 10 minutes' drive away from the original Henderson hole in the wall that I've loved for so long.  Very little has changed, and I draw that comparison to two different things. It's the same space where Buddha Belly Deli (and, previously, East Coast Eats) tried to carve out success with casual lunch food, and the tables and chairs are the same as the Buddha's. The fountain drink area and the semi-exposed restrooms (now hidden with a rather garish high-back booth-like chair) are no different either. And there's even lucky bamboo, likely from well-wishing acquaintances of the owner.  More importantly, the food is also the same menu and the same quality. My 5 piece order of chicken fingers ($6.29) yielded the same huge boneless pieces of white meat with the same moistness and crunchy exterior as I've enjoyed so many times before. They were complemented as usual by my choice of Habanero Honey sauce (1 sauce included w/ order), which is an addictive spicy (medium-hot) and sweet blend. I should revisit their many other sauce options next time though - perhaps Jamaican Jerk or Creamy Garlic Parmesan, or a simple Honey Garlic? Maybe all of the above, since it's just 39 little Lincolns for each extra sauce (49 cents for some of the choices such as ranch or blue cheese).  The fries are at least as delicious as and even more addictive than the chicken. Ever since I discovered that the \"small\" order ($2.49) is still at least twice as big as the combo portion of fries, I've stopped using the combo. This also both saves me money (half a dollar) and spares me from unnecessary high-fructose corn syrup. Anyway, these fried potato shoestrings are just as crunchy and fatty here as I've grown to love, not to mention properly seasoned. It's a tragedy when fries aren't even given enough salt, and Chicken Shack has yet to commit that sin.  Although I have a similar drive time to both my original favorite location and this newest Chicken Shack, I'll probably head here a lot more often from now on because it's on the way home from work, and just off the highway to boot. Another plus: the TVs here have DirecTV HD.   Whether it's game time or just lunch/dinner, Chicken Shack is well worth the visit for some of the best \"fast food\" around. I have an inkling that they just might make this their home for a good while, but as they say, time will tell."}
{"text":"By far the best chicken fingers i ever had, and I am a chicken lover ... Platonically of course!  They even taste great cold, amazing quality, the sauces are very good as well...and the wings are very good as well. The fingers deserve 6 stars, hands down."}
{"text":"Great food for a really good price. The chicken fingers were lightly breaded and moist. The hot barbecue sauce had a nice bite and flavor. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Well.... I was supposed to wait to try this place with my husband. But, coming out of kohls it smelt so good. Lol! I walked in and was crowded, good service. was greeted as I walked in! I ordered me a burger (well done) with bacon (extra crispy) the guy in the back was really nice (might have been the owner he was older) I think I only waited for 5 minutes. They got my order 100% correct! For $8 you get bacon (.50) charge fries and a drink. Good deal. You get a lot of fries and onions, pickles and cheese. Very delicious! I will be bringing my husband. Next is the chicken lol!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this little gem....they didn't disappoint! Juicy chicken and delicious array of sauces. The fries were crispy and seasoned well. Staff was very friendly and service was remarkably fast. Definitely our new favorite spot to eat!!"}
{"text":"This is a great chicken spot. Taste almost like a great southern chicken restaurant. I cant wait to drive back to Vegas, i will be stopping here every time!"}
{"text":"Okay, finally tried this place. In short, it was okay. Not worth going out of your way to go to, but if you're in the neighborhood, stop in and try it. Service is exceptional, very friendly. And I wish I could say that the food was stellar...but it wasn't. It was okay."}
{"text":"Thanks to Bethany E. for turning me on to Chicken Shack. To my surprise after I checked in and was seated Bethany came over and introduced herself. It was a pleasure to meet you finally Bethany!  It was the lunch hour and Chicken Shack was rockin although I had no problem finding convenient parking. I opted for the six wing combo which included shoe string fries and a beverage. Service is prompt - within minutes my entree was brought to my table and I was taken back of the size of  the chicken pieces served. I chose chipotle sauce on the side which was tasty and the fries were also yummy. The portions are generous here and I couldn't finish all  the fries.  I would definitely return to the Chicken Shack."}
{"text":"I might be addicted to this place like how Kramer felt about Kenny Rogers Rosters.  They are super fast and the food is always ALWAYS fresh and delicious.  The sweet Chile sauce is a must for me and the fries are the best in Las Vegas.  Place is clean and the staff is always nice."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for over 5 years.  Amazing food!  Wings, strips and chili is the best in this city."}
{"text":"Amazing!   The chicken was perfectly breaded and the fries were hot and delicious!  The employees/maybe owner was super nice!  She was so cheerful and welcoming and the man was very very nice.  They made you feel like you belonged and were part of the chickens shack's family!  It's fast food but we got restaurant service.  They came out and checked on us multiple times to see if we liked it.   Anytime we are driving back from Vegas I will make it a point to stop here!  So so good.  Oh and also, the bathroom key made me giggle! Bonus: The bathrooms were clean and smelled good. If you are rolling by this place it's a must stop!"}
{"text":"these are the best chicken wings I've had.  Now, my scope is limited to hooters, bars, and such when consuming chicken wings but, I have eaten many many chicken wings.    These are really crispy, good wing sauce, good blue cheese dressing.  I also ate the chicken fingers.  My friend didn't like them naked.  I believe these are the best chicken fingers I ate as well.  I liked the chicken fingers naked.  These fingers were thinly battered and just super fried.  Once again, you may decide that you like a whole bunch of batter on your fingers.  I haven't tried anything else. I plan on going back and finding it out.  If you are in the hood' this is the place for wings."}
{"text":"I just love the service here, and the food it Awesome.  Must try for everyone.  Great prices, super fast, very filling, great selection of sauces for ur wings and strips"}
{"text":"We were missing our favorite chicken fingers from Old Chicago restaurant back in Colorado. We truly hit the jackpot with The Chicken Shack. The chicken tenders here are huge, and very tasty. I just wish there was more room to sit and eat. All tables were full. But when every table is taken, you have to know this place rocks!"}
{"text":"Delicioso! My husband was in the mood for chicken tenders, and this location was close to us. There was no one else eating here when we arrived, so that always makes me worried about the food being fresh. We split a 5 piece basket with the fries.  As soon as we sat down, people started arriving. We first sat down in the high back, fabric covered bench seats. Well, that was kind of a mistake as we noticed all of the chicken grease all over the seats. We simply moved.   Our food came out shortly after this, and it was super hot. The chicken was excellent. The pieces were quite large, and the chicken was moist and juicy. Fries were perfectly done. This is some of the best chicken we have had in a while."}
{"text":"All we can say is yummy for our tummy!!!!   A co worker just told me about this place....  we were trying it....  sooooo good.  The cashier girl is really nice n sweet....and girl who brought our food to the table was so nice.  Also there was a man walking around ...  I'm thinking manager....  was making sure everyone was ok......  We will be back often."}
{"text":"Love this place! I've been coming here since they first opened and haven't been disappointed yet. The owners are always friendly and inviting no matter how busy the place is. Whenever I'm in this side of town it is my go to stop."}
{"text":"We were on our way to Vegas from Phoenix AZ, on our way to see Enrique Iglesias! With time not really on our side, we decided to grab a quick bite. The chicken Shack had the BEST reviews I had ever seen so we gave it a GO! I don't know if it was all the adrenaline rushing through my veins because we were on our way to watch my love ENRIQUE, or the fact that the food was just so delicious, and convenient. Is literally on the highway! At first i seen a long line and I freaked out but GOSH!!! All it took was a nice shot of vodka (which i carry in my purse) and i automatically started to relax. Plus all the employees were super friendly and super FAST! I ordered both wings and tenders along with fries! Everything TOP NOTCH! Restrooms were so clean ! I LOVE it! I will be going back soon! SEE YOU SOON CHICKEN TENDERS AND WINGS!!!"}
{"text":"For a chicken place it's great they have like 20 sauces and rubs and like more than 5 side's."}
{"text":"Very good tenders! I can only express this rating and review on the tenders and sweet chili sauce. Both were just right. The tenders are white meat and no gristle or unwanted \"parts.\" The breading is light enough that it doesn't fall off and crispy enough that it's not a chore to eat. I think it was seasoned well too. The sweet chili dipping sauce had just the right amount of heat and not overly sweet or gelatinous in texture, like some \"sweet/sour\" sauces can be. For takeout during a lunch rush, the wait was less than 10 minutes for an order of tenders. Also a plus, will be back!!"}
{"text":"The fries were soggy and all the chicken was dried out as if it been sitting there. I see why she said be there in 5 minutes. 12 price and chilling cheese fries shouldn't be done in 5 mins. I want my 23.00 back."}
{"text":"Yummmm is all I have to say.  The chicken fingers were delicious. And I'm not sure of what they do to their fries but they were really good as well. I wasn't a huge fan of their new bourbon sauce or their chipotle bbq (very watery) but everything else was good. I'll definitely go again!"}
{"text":"I like the decor in the inside of of restaurant but I would prefer going to Cane's or even Dairy Queen for better chicken strips and fries. Everything smelled delicious when I ordered it and the customer service was great, but the food did not deliver.  I ordered a 3 piece chicken strip combo with fries and a drink. My lemonade from the drink machine first tasted weird, then my fries were hella oily, and the strips were salty. The cashier suggested at check-out to try the different sauces on the side, and they were delicious.Two sauces come with the combo but the food was a huge disappointment.  I doubt if I will ever return to this eating establishment because I've had better chicken at Wendy's and other fat food chains."}
{"text":"Holy smokes this place is fantastic! We always pass it when going out of town, and we finally decided to give it a go. We purchased the large chicken wing family special with coslaw and fries. Y'all- the wings were huge and the sauces were delicious. It was a hit among the entire family. The staff was super nice, and the service was great. Our food came out so fast, I was almost surprised. Total bonus, they have sweet tea!! We look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Best chicken in Vegas! I have been coming here for 10 years and the staff make you feel right at home. Their salads are fantastic and don't forget to order the fries.   Go here and you don't want chicken any place else in Vegas."}
{"text":"It was a Sunday, a bit hungover and looking for that first recovery meal. I got one of the ads in the mail for a chicken restaurant. Thinking that it was just another ordinary wings place, I tried and stepped in the bright yellow and metal interior decor. I order the #3 with 3 fingers and fries and my sister had the chicken wings. The fries were crisp and abundant. Not oily and was actual cut potatoes not the frozen stuff. The fingers were not dry underneath the batter which made me not even need to dip in in the honey habanero sauce. Which was amazing by the way. My sisters wings was a bit too much batter because it overwhelmed the actual meat. But overall it was a good amount as well for the price.  I would definitely be going back to try the other menu items on a non hungover day. Thanks Chicken shack for being so close to the house!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best chicken places in the Southeast area.  Most people go for the wings but they also have a flavorful grilled option; even more delicious when coupled with their signature honey barbecue sauce.   Bottom line: great food, drinks, and friendly people. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"OMG!! who would guess that the best chicken fingers and wings are served here.  The restaurant is very clean and the staff is very friendly.  Make sure you stop here when you're in Boulder City and enjoy the food which is served hot and delicious with little waiting.  Huge variety of flavors from mild to damn hot!  I will become a regular."}
{"text":"I love the chicken fingers and dipping sauces the bbq baked beans were okay the potatoe salad and macaroni salad are amazing the only Thing I didn't like the past couple times is my food took over 25 mins the guy hooked it up with larges so Im not tripping"}
{"text":"Dude, this is some awesome fried chicken! Jesus, I love it! The breading is just perfect, not too heavy and the chicken is so moist. I don't know how they do it. The fries are nice and crisp and salty and accompany the chicken so well.   The restaurant is a little hole in the wall, things can get pretty cramped in there. It's a place to grab you chicken, eat it fast and get out there. If you do take it home though it is also tasty; with some places the fries would get soggy but these retain their crispness.  It's damn good fried chicken. Nuff said."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've tried \"The Chicken Shack\". I have to admit that the product they use in their preparations is top shelf, the wings were plump and juicy (I've seen smaller drumsticks!). I also like the crunchy nature of their recipe. Still, two things disappoint me, one the crunchiness of the product is diminished by the buildup of steam in their to go packaging. Also, they lack charisma at the point of sale, I wish the employees enjoyed themselves more."}
{"text":"Best chicken in the valley!!! Killing wingstop in many ways too! Used to visit twice a week when I lived nearby. Variety of sauces you can choose from: garlic parm, spicy BBQ, habanero, jerk, original hot, etc..... Great place for watching sports too!  The only issue is that they charge for ranch, blue cheese. I feel like it should be included with wings but I don't mind paying cuz i needs my ranch! Would recommend anyone looking for quality chicken!"}
{"text":"What is fry sauce? Synthetic Innout sauce. It tasted so fake, I don't even want to know what's in it. The honey mustard also still tasted like it was made in a laboratory and was not meant to be consumed. What are you guys using to make this stuff?!  The chicken is oily and heavy on the breading. Choose fingers over wings. If you're looking for wings go elsewhere. The fries are shoestring fries and they're pretty good if you get lucky. If you're unlucky, they'll be overfried and you'll regret eating them. The sauces for the chicken are all free, the other sauces, such as fry sauce, are 39 cents."}
{"text":"Forget visiting the hoover dam. Visit this place. Looks like an old gas station, but the chicken was real good!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Today I had my first experience with The Chicken Shack on a recommendation from a new client. She suggested that I order the #4 combo (3 wings and 3 chicken fingers with fries and a drink).   The staff is fabulous! Rachael was behind the counter to take my order and answered my questions regarding the flavors very patiently after welcoming me with a big smile.  The chicken was lightly battered, moist, juicy and delicious. You drizzle or dip into the flavor as you like. In my opinion, the sauce is not even necessary because the chicken itself has such a great taste. The fries were wonderful; not limp or greasy like some places and there were a ton of them. I ate as much as I could and brought the rest of my meal home for dinner.  I would highly recommend this place and will certainly return again!"}
{"text":"Rothman S.'s review is so accurate!   I went to this place based on the recommendation of a co-worker and I prefer to support independents.    It's noon/lunch hour and I can not imagine placing a less welcoming person at the register/order station. NOT A HINT of a smile came across that woman's face and the entire time she was taking my order she had her blue eyes starring out the window. NO LIE; I looked behind me to see what was in the parking lot that was so damn captivating.  I must admit she did make eye contact one time; when I handed her my twenty bucks.    There was no one tending/cleaning the empty tables, so if you came after me; enjoy the crumbs & spilled sauce!   I have an idea, put Ms. Personality on busboy duty and allow customers to yell their order to the cook in the kitchen!  She'd be less appalling and the next customer wouldn't have stains on the elbows of their long sleeve shirt!   I end this by stating my opinion about the food because that's all that really matters, right?  Simply; the chicken was consistent with the service.  F"}
{"text":"After paying respects to my Dad at the Veterans Memorial,  my daughter was hungry. So I let her choose the spot. I'm happy with her choice. The chicken was juicy and not over cooked and dry. Flavors were delicious.  Definitely recommend the Chicken Shack to friends and family. And the lady and guy, I'm assuming they were owners, were really nice and concerned on how the food and services were.. signs of a passionate owners of their craft.. I love the habanero honey sauce! But that's 1 of many selection of sauces. We'll be there again and curious to try the other sauces and menu selections.. good eats!!"}
{"text":"I work in the pharmaceutical industry, and do a lot of catered lunch and learns at doctors offices on the daily, so I'm very picky about takeout. This place is the first place I have ever ventured to yelp about... that's how good it is. Before my life in pharma sales, right after graduate school;  I even opened one of those, \"don't believe the hype\", over-priced chicken restaurants on the strip. This chicken was as good, if not better than the southern-style chicken restaurant that I opened on the strip in Vegas!!!  Don't waste your time with anyplace else Vegas! Plus, as a former cocktail server, I'm picky about service, and this place was top notch!   The only time that an entire doctors office has given me rave reviews for the catering!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and wonderful customer service.  I can't stop bragging about this place!!"}
{"text":"I've gotten Chicken Shack 3 times. The first 2 times were around lunch time, and I thought the food was amazing (I've only had the fingers and wings so far.) I LOVED the fries. The third time I went there was a Friday afternoon, and everything had less flavor, even the sauce. The fries were really soggy and seemed like they were undercooked as well.  I'll try again, though, and hopefully that one Friday was just a fluke."}
{"text":"Ate here Once fell in love.It was finger licking good,I would go there at least twice a week or more, if you really like eating Chicken Wings."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I arrived at Chicken Shack at 8:30 on a Friday night. As we walked in most of the dining area had the chairs on top if the table tops and an employee was sweeping the room. I find this so annoying as they aren't supposed to close for another half hour. When I ordered the guy behind the counter seemed like he wished we hadn't walked in. He turns and asks the cook if the fryer is \"still on\". Why wouldn't it be on?  You don't close for another 30 minutes. We sit at one of the few remaining tables to wait for our food. When my order comes up they call my name and say \"Aaron! Togo!\"  Umm, no I didn't order it togo, but we can take your rude hint and we leave. I work in the restaurant industry and I know that your closing time means that's when you stop taking orders or seating people. Sorry if you had big plans for a Friday night but I had plans too. Plans to get some delicious fried chicken wings and fingers and hang out with my girl. We left very disappointed on our first and LAST experience at Chicken Shack, and not due to the food though which was very good. But there are too many great spots in town where we can get good food AND at least decent service."}
{"text":"As an avid chicken tender fan,  my boyfriend and I are always looking for the next best chicken tenders.   We decided to give this place a try,  and I will say I am presently impressed.   The place it's self is kind of a hole in the wall,  the decor consists of 'why did the chicken cross the road\" jokes,  and license places on the walls from various states it's self.    Service is very fast,  and friendly.   We both decided to order the five piece chicken tender meal considering of five tenders  some fries and a drink.   I was pleased to see that they had am array of different seasonings and sauces to go with your chicken. Including chilli,  hot,  mild,   lemon pepper,  and sweet garlic.  I decided to get lemon pepper seasoning,  and a side of honey mustard.  The chicken it's self it nice,  crispy,  and juicy... Magically everything you could possibly want in a chicken tender.  Unlike canes,  I actually really enjoyed their skinny fries that came with the meal.    I was an avid canes lover.... Now it looks like im more of a chicken shack fan.   All and all I'm very impressed with the food,  and service,  and will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"I am so so so disappointed after my latest experience tonight. I ordered a 20 piece finger meal and a large fries. They offer 4 \"free\" dipping sauces ( I got our chicken plain) and they have like 15-20 sauces to choose from, BUT they charge for ranch and honey mustard...how do they offer so many flavors but charge for the staples?? It felt bad greedy!! To charge for the most popular sauces for chicken fingers so they know they can get a couple of extra bucks out of you feels shady. Then when I get home and feed it to my family the chicken tasted like it was fried in really old or burnt oil and had such an unpleasant taste and even worse aftertaste.... my kids don't even want to eat it. I spent close to 40-50 bucks (  my bill came to 63 dollars because of misunderstanding on my order so 20 was refunded and then charged an additional charge, because of this I am unsure of the amount of my bill,) but I assume its pretty close to $50. I think this will be my last visit! Super disappointing. They did have great employees who were kind and inviting. Still, that will not make up for bad tasting chicken and greedy additional charges."}
{"text":"This is a good little spot i stopped in for lunch and got the 3 piece combo they have quite a few options for sauces this time i got the chipotle bbq verry tasty and the ranch was on point the breading on the chicken fingers is really good but the quality of the chicken itself is a bit on the cheap side, the fries were perfection and the portion is big, The lady on the counter isnt verry friendly any time i come in but gets the job done but a smile wouldn't  hurt"}
{"text":"Recently reviewed this restaurant which I love! Fast food and friendly service. Had to come back with an updated picture of my favorite. The 6 piece of wings and fries tossed in hot."}
{"text":"I have to admit, their Chicken Strip are the best I have ever had!!!!  And they are very quick with your order!!! The Service is great!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome wings. We showed up three minutes to close and were about to get back in the truck when the young man came out and said we will serve you! How awesome! They were so friendly and accommodating and the food was outrageously delicious."}
{"text":"Not impressed... The wings are WAY to greasy and chicken strips are too dry. I've been here twice, hoping I'll feel differently the next time around but no... A selection of sauces is nice but the wing and strips are lacking. As you bite in, you taste old oil, ew."}
{"text":"Wow, this place has amazing chicken wings! It looks like it was an old drive in, but they don't have car hops. Loved the wings, and the chicken fingers were good. Definitely an awesome value! Glad my family decided to stop here!"}
{"text":"They really know how to make  Chicken!!!  I really loved everything there especially their fries  were amazing and if you get tired of the same taste guess what?! They have a bunch of different sauces you can dip your chicken or fries in. This is my go to spot in Boulder!"}
{"text":"Omg! The best chicken fingers i think I've ever had so good!!! Can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"Meh tasting. I got 10 chicken tenders and the happy hour special with hot wings. Chicken was crispy on the outside and moist inside but not flavorful and very greasy. The grease in my stomach and intense thirst woke me and my friend up in the middle of the night! The fries are skinny but plentiful. Generous portions (we couldn't finish between 3 hungry people), cheap beer and nice staff though!"}
{"text":"I loved the Chicken Shack! We told the man helping us it was our first time and he was very helpful in explaining all he different options. I had the wings tossed in medium sauce (buffalo sauce). My husband had the #4 (half wings, half chicken fingers) with chili cheese fries. Everything was so good! We also for a side of fry sauce and it was delicious.   The inside was on the smaller side, but the patio had plenty of seating. We ate outside because we brought our two dogs with us. I'm always weary of taking the dogs because not every place is dog friendly. The staff was super friendly and specifically came out to say hi to our pups and even gave them a piece of grilled chicken. They also had a water bowl for them.   The whole restaurant was nice and clean (bathrooms too)! My husband and I will defiantly be back!!"}
{"text":"I have been waiting for The Chicken Shack to open since I saw the signs about a month ago. This new  location on Rainbow is great for your chicken cravings. Deliciously juicy chicken fingers and wings for a good price. Wings are quite large. My boyfriend and I were able to share three fingers and a few wings. Ask for sauces on the side as the chicken is fine and a bit salty (and oily) on its own. That is probably the only downfall but good in an unhealthy way ha. Shoe string fries have a nice crunch."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. Staff is friendly and food arrive fast. The chicken fingers taste delicious and they are nicely sized. Wasn't a huge fan of their fries, but would return back."}
{"text":"Despite driving by this place more times than I can count I didn't even know this place existed. At my last Yelp event Bethany E. was telling me about this spot and how great it was. Once it was brought to my attention I finally noticed it while driving by. So, Saturday comes around and my husband and I doing the thing where we run through 50 options before picking a lunch spot.  My husband remembered that we wanted to try this spot and we knew it had to be done.  This spot was busy on a Saturday afternoon which was a good sign. We decided to get our order to go and it didn't take long for it to be prepared. The guy at the counter was friendly. The prices are great as well.  I really liked the chicken fingers. There is plenty of white meat and the breading is really good. The breading was light and seemed like it was made fresh for our order, not kept in a heater until served. The French fries were really good. The large order was way too many fries, a small would have been enough for two to share. I'd been craving macaroni salad and this macaroni salad really hit the spot. I loved it. The sauce options are crazy. There are so many. We ordered about six because we couldn't decide. My favorite was the Honey BBQ with the Sweet Chili coming in second.   Great food and great prices. This spot definitely beats the chicken chain that is completely overrated."}
{"text":"We ordered the Shack Pack with the 20 fingers to go.  The place is small with some inside and outside seating.  We didn't have any trouble finding a table right away.   It was good but my favorite was their baked beans!"}
{"text":"Just what you expect it to be. Great chicken strips, great fries, great sauces."}
{"text":"The service was quick and the chicken was crispy and juicy and not too oily. Their serving sizes are good and filling. Their sauces weren't as good as good as canes' and you can get more from canes for the same price, but if I were in the area I'd go there again"}
{"text":"I tried the chicken strips and the wings and they were both excellent. The sauces are good, and they have a good selection of them. Definitely better than Canes or any place like that"}
{"text":"Imma start off by saying me and my boyfriend know wings. Nothing is ever spicy enough for him. Finally had a chance to try it here after some co workers recommended. My boyfriend had the damn hot and the habanero honey. I got the creamy garlic parm and the sweet chili. He got combo #4 and then I just got a five piece finger. We split all the food. We are both sitting in the car right now holding our stomachs. Lol. Soooo good! Literally no complaints. We did have to wipe down our own table. But this is an older hole in the wall with a reputation of good chicken. They have cheap beer and a tv playing the game for people who are into that. Definetly  making the trip out here to eat. Well worth it. When I asked my boyfriend how did this compare to bdubs he said and I quote \"this place shits on bdubs\" lol and we used to be regular bdub custies. So.. Nuff said. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Love this place, I was very happy when they opened the second location. Customer service is great and the food never disappoints."}
{"text":"Stopped here on our long drive from Phoenix to SLC. The wings, chicken strips, and fries were great. I elected to have my sauce on my wings while my husband and daughter had them on the side. I think they were better on the wings. Lots of different sauce flavors and dipping choices.  A hole in the wall kind of joint where the food far exceeds the decor. Big rubber chicken key chain for the bathroom a nice touch.  Will come back for sute."}
{"text":"Wow! It should be called CheapSkate Shack! We are obviously regulars here (ashamed to say Dukedom) and they wouldn't let us have a water cup...basically accusing us of trying to steal soda. My daughter drinks water or soda. If she wanted soda today, we would have bought a soda like all the other times before. But to hassle regular customers about a stupid water cup is RIDICULOUS!!  Being the greasy dive you are CS, you will attract the less than savory crowd who take advantage of water cup privileges. Solve the problem without insulting your regular paying clientele! Also from the lack of cleanliness in your dining area...you could do for a health inspection."}
{"text":"I was by the area on vacation and it was recommended by the locals. I have to say I'm not a fan of fried chicken but this was great. Not greasy!  Nice people serving you. Loved the wide sauce selection."}
{"text":"Great tasting chicken wings and strips! Well maintained restaurant space and rest room. Very pleasant environment. A MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"Chicken Shack is a great restaurant! It's a real mom & pop place.  I can't eat any thing breaded due to my gluten allergy. They make me the chicken tenders but without the breading and it is delicious! You can really tell it's good quality chicken. They also make a great chicken salad.  This little spot is great! Stop by and see what you have been missing."}
{"text":"The food was good and came out quicker then expected. A must try if your a local or visitor."}
{"text":"On our way back to Vegas from Hoover Dam, I accidentally stopped here. Family owned business that is friendly. \"Damn Hot\" sauce is Damn good. I ate here and ordered more \"Damn Hot\" wings to munch on, in Vegas. The fries are really good too. You won't regret coming here at all."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! These are the BEST wings! Small little place but the chicken is freaking amazing. I get so excited when I order from here. They are fast too. The garlic parmesan dry wings are my fav! My husbands the honey bbq and my daughter. I do not enjoy the fries but they wings are to well worth it."}
{"text":"Breaded chicken strips and fries are amazing! Chicken strips are really thick and tender as well. They also carry an amazing array of dipping sauces! One interesting note is that the fries are super thin and crispy. They are truly addicting!!"}
{"text":"One of the best places to go to in Boulder City. This is the best chicken shack location in the valley."}
{"text":"Great chicken, super nice folks making it.  We just happened to stop while road tripping and were pleasantly surprised by the portions and how good it was.  I wish they were in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Their wings are huge compared to the other \"chain\" wings joints. I adored their honey garlic wings, but not a big fan of the lemon pepper wings which was too salty and couldn't really taste the lemon or the pepper. Their thin cut fries are also great and a great value. We'll definitely come back the next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"It's GREAT!! Hand made chicken tenders. Unbelievable! Friendly staff, clean and great taste!"}
{"text":"This place stands the test of time! I have been eating Chicken Shack since it was called \"Chicken Bonz\" and the food is always great. It's hip, and truly a local jewel!   I think the only thing about this place is a quote on the wall about immigrants that seems very offensive... But other than that this place is cool."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good.  I miss the old seafood place that had the best crab strips in town but the chicken here is pretty good.  The BBQ sauce is a bit too \"runny\" but the flavor is fine.  The Chicken wings and tenders are pretty good size and you won't go away hungry.  They give you enough fries to feed the neighbors!  For chicken, we're now down to Popeye's and The Chicken Shack.  And...they just opened another restaurant on St. Rose Parkway and 7 Hills!"}
{"text":"After a small lunch at Hot Dog Heaven in Henderson,  I was ravenous come dinner time. After reading the great reviews of the Chicken Shack I knew my hunger Blues were about to end.  This small restaurant was jammed with people which is always a good sign. I got the 5 piece Chicken Fingers with fries. Calling them fingers is misleading as they are very big cuts of breast meat that are expertly coated and fried to perfection. The seasoning on the chicken was a letdown as it was way too salty. The sauces are all house made and my Honey Garlic helped out my salty chicken quite a bit.  Overall a decent meal that is close to being great once they get the seasoning down."}
{"text":"An amazing place in a store front complex who not only serves amazing fingers with a variety of choices of sauce, but also sells beer, so you have have amazing wings or fingers with a beer, what a deal in a small store front environment.  The food is actually very good and the staff extremely friendly.  It really does not matter if it is your first time or you have been many times, you are treated like you have been coming there for a long time and they are always happy to see you.  I like this place and highly recommend this place if you are looking for a snack or a meal, either way it is a place worth trying."}
{"text":"Great food and very friendly staff /  new owners!   Will be back lots. Had the chicken strips and chili.  Both were the bomb!"}
{"text":"There hot sauce is super good!!! They make really good chicken strips too. The people working there are very nice.  The only critique is I wish they had more chicken sandwiches on their menu or variety"}
{"text":"They are fast good and their chicken quality/size leave others crying  in their buffalo sauce. If their burger buns didn't disintegrate, they would be   better with me. Love it."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal: lightly breaded chicken breast tenders with a wide choice of dipping sauces and delicious fries. The service is very friendly and the atmosphere is casual."}
{"text":"Awesome chicken wings! Ordered 6 wing combo with fries and a drink and I was so full! Crunchy wings with great sauce on the side! Great and fast service! Will go back again!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience as always. The owner suggested we have a Family platter. 25 wings 2 LG sides and 4 drinks..Good suggestion since there were 8 of us. Food was out fast they adjusted the tables to accommodate us. Thanks Chicken Shack.. see you on our next cheat day!"}
{"text":"This place was alright. We were incredibly hungover and cruising around town when we spotted this place. Food was greasy and the tables were dirty but I was in no position to be picky.  The food did its job. Soaked up all that Fat Tuesday  Nothing I would go out of my way for. Meh"}
{"text":"We stopped here after a trip to the Hoover Dam and are happy we did. The chicken fingers were amazing!!!  The burgers were delicious. Everything was cooked fresh and came out hot. It was fast and the employees were super friendly. The portions were huge. Definitely on our list of places to revisit!  It's hard to find good food and friendly people, but this place has both."}
{"text":"It was 7pm, I was jonesin' for some chicken, didn't want to cook, so I looked to Facebook and my fellow yelpers for good places to grab some chicken. The reviews for this place were great, and a lot of my friends cursed me out because I have lived here for 4 years and never tried this place.    First things first:  Pros: Short drive from my house Cheap combination plates Festive decor   Cons:  Was a little put off at the guy mopping the floor while I was eating.    The food is amazing!! And they give you a LOT of it. I ordered the #4, 3 chicken fingers,  3 wings, fries & a drink (with ranch)  $10 & some change. The fries, shoestring, are so good and seasoned (which is rare out here cause everyone is afraid of seasoning). I couldn't even finish. Ate 1 finger and one wing, handful of fries, and I was done. Will definitely return, definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Awesome chicken wings with beer! We ordered the sweet spicy and teriyaki extra crispy."}
{"text":"There were a lot of kids just hanging out... that's not bad but.... the shop was playing rap type music... not my taste....  the food was not great... Canes chicken is much better and better prices... I will not be going back there!!"}
{"text":"Just opened recently, great food and awesome customer service.  The fingers are my favorite by far. Will be back"}
{"text":"Really some of the best wings I've ever had. Their batter is crisp and thick without being unnecessarily greasy. I had 6 wings smothered in honey bbq and dipped the other 6 in bleu cheese dressing.  Their wings are pretty huge too so get a bunch but don't be afraid to share! the staff is also super nice"}
{"text":"First time tip: ask for the sauce on the side - wings perfect as they are, undressed!"}
{"text":"After 5 years and many more experiences with wings... I still have to say that this place is my all time fav! The wings are lightly dusted with flour and friend to crispy perfection. Habanero Honey is still the best flavor. The wings are pretty big... We ordered 12 and that feed two people. The kicker? We ended up with 14 in our order!   Wish Sacramento has a place like this... I miss vegas because of this spot!! Worth the drive from the strip!"}
{"text":"This location was conveniently right across Highway 93 from our camping spot.  The had fun decor with license plates on the wall, funny celebrity quotes, and photos of dogs on the walls.  This place is very popular and stays busy most of the time.  The staff was friendly and attentive.  You can get your own fountain drinks in the dining area, and can sit inside or outside.  We came over for dinner and ordered the Three Chicken Tenders meal with a side of french fries.  You can choose one dipping sauce with the meal and can buy others.  I got a side of teriyaki and blue cheese.  The chicken was moist and tender with a crispy tempura-like breading.  The downside is that it seemed to have a texture to it that I didn't really care for.  I was kind of \"waxy\" upon chewing that made it difficult for me to eat.  It wasn't a bad flavor but texture only.  I might opt for a bone in chicken wing meal next time to avoid the texture issue."}
{"text":"Holly chicken! This place is good. It's homy, mom n pop owned and the service is as friendly as it gets. Not to mention clean and well, the chicken is incredibly delicious. Perfectly bartered and fried. The string fries are crunchy and as golden as their customer service.  Oh and they offer a military discount:)  Definitely coming back when I'm in the area again!"}
{"text":"The place is a fast food outlet in competition with Raising Cane's. Service is good, but a but a bit on the pricy side. Chicken fingers and wings are not crispy. The fries are soggy and the sauces are forgettable. It's just ok. You could do worse, but I prefer Cane's."}
{"text":"This place has the best wings and chicken fingers... they are so crispy and delicious! The wings taste like mini pieces of fried chicken. I don't know what they use for breading, but it's delicious. My 10yr old son said that the chicken fingers were the \"best he'd ever had\"! The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because they don't have \"honey-hot\" for a sauce option. I tried their honey garlic and honey habenero, but it didn't satisfy my craving for honey hot sauce.... luckily I had the stuff to make my own at home."}
{"text":"Why did the chicken cross the road? Every table at Chicken Shack was full so I took out my chicken and crossed Mountain Vista Road with it to the Ethal M. Cactus Gardens picnic table. So much for my joke, here is my review of Chicken Shack. It is based on my two recent lunch time visits that were on July 9 and today.      Chicken Shack is a small restaurant in the Smith's and Barley's Casino-anchored Shopping center that has masses of people shocking to the southeast corner of Sunset and Mountain Vista. The two times that I have shocked here in the mid afternoon, the place was packed. Today, I barely landed a table when a couple left. I came close to having to take it out to Ethal. M Cactus Gardens for an impromptu picnic. The reason that Chicken Shack is so popular is that they serve quality food at prices that won't burden the wallet in an upbeat environment.     It is funny that many of the hole in the  places that I have dined in are the most fun places to dine in. Chicken Shack is a quintessential example. Adorning the walls are humorous quotes related to chicken jokes, the Chicken Shack mascot that reminds me of a yellow version of Foghorn Leghorn, and license plates from all over. Supposedly every state licence plate is represented on these walls. Here is an example of one of the humorous quotes on the walls of Chicken Shack:      \"In my day, we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the road. Someone told us that the chicken crossed the road and that was good enough.\"  Grandpa    What is not a joke is the food. And plenty of food! On both of my visits I'd order a combo. The combo includes shoestring fries and a Pepsi fountain beverage. In response to the previous Yelpers stating that the shoestring fries were good, I say \"Ditto.\"     On Friday, July 9; I ordered six chicken wings dipped in a hot garlic honey sauce. The price of the meal was $9.95. If I opted for one of the sundry dipping sauces, I'd pay an additional 50 cents. After taking my $ and name, they brought the food to my table a few minutes later. Sharing the table with the chicken wings combo was a roll of paper towels. They were necessary. These chicken wings were the stickiest finger food that I remember eating in a long time. This might go down as the stickiest finger food or thing that I reviewed on Yelp. I got extraordinary use out of the paper towels. With that said, Chicken Shack chicken wings and texting is a bad combination. When I got past the consistent reaching back and forth to the paper towels, the chicken wings were all right. They were loaded with  white meat and flavor.     Today, I ordered the chicken sandwich combo for $6.99. They gave me a choice between crispy and grilled. I chose grilled. It was worth the long wait. This leads into me recommending passing over Chicken Shack if your in a hurry. This isn't a fast food joint where the chicken is sitting under a lamp. When the chicken sandwich arrived, I was like, \"Wow.\" The sandwich was stuffed with three mutant chicken fingers, lettuce, onions, and tomatoes next to a large portion of shoestring fries. Two of the pictures below show the giant sandwich. It is safe to say that I did not leave hungry.      In the future I conceive visiting Chicken Shack to put their chicken fingers to the test. Ideally this will be at their Boulder City location after hiking. In the present I give Chicken Shack my 4 star stamp of approval."}
{"text":"We eat here all the time - we drive across town to get our Chicken Shack fix! Best chicken fingers - fresh, juicy and thick. I always get the kids meal and am stuffed! Their fries are delicious. I don't know what they season them with but they're yummy! I've tried a lot of their sauces the habanero honey is my go to fave. Small place - always busy!"}
{"text":"It's awesome they Bread their chicken at the place , but so does Chick-Fil-A (which is actually good). The chicken and fries are super salty, and for waiting about five minutes, I would have expected hot food. They ask you if you want any sauces then charge you extra without telling you. The fry sauce is okay and the honey mustard is good. The sweet tea is pretty good."}
{"text":"I have recently relocated to the area from the east coast and a huge wing lover.  Currently on a diet but wanted some wings for my cheat day.  Found this place on yelp and they had pretty good reviews.  When I drove up I knew it was about ambiance but all about the food.  The lady at the counter was helping someone else but still greeted me with a pleasant hello and was i pick8up or ordering.  I order a 12 piece wing and #2 tender combo.  You can have your wings sauced there or dip them yourself. I asked for my wings to be extra crispy and they were perfect and good size pieces.  The fries were great and sauces diluted enough for dipping or coating your chicken perfectly.  I WILL BE BACK VERY SOON.  You can place large orders as well with 30min notice."}
{"text":"First of all, it is relatively expensive for what it is.  Family of 4, 2 adults and 2 children under 10, $40.  That seems a bit much imo.    I got a chicken mozzarella wrap with the cucumber salad.  $10 w/o a drink.  Wrap was actually very good, cucumber salad was a bowl of cucumbers with straight, potent apple cider vinegar poured on it.  Way to strong a vinegar flavor to be edible.    My wife got a chicken Caesar wrap with Mac and cheese. Wasn't very impressed.    Friends that met us here got a chicken meal with mashed potatoes.  Chicken wasn't bad, potatoes weren't impressive.   Drink dispenser sprays soda all over your wrist.    Brought the wrong order to our table and weren't very friendly when we brought it back to them.  They replaced it, but didn't really say sorry or anything or even speak to us about it. They looked mad at their staff, took the wrong stuff away and didn't say anything.  I stood there for a bit and then told them, \"I guess I'll go sit back down and wait for it.\" and they didn't reply.   Simply, it wasn't overly impressive for $40.  Won't be returning"}
{"text":"This is my first experience at a Chicken Shack and I was pleasantly surprised! The tenders are battered perfectly and I love the skinny, salty fries.  My favorite part is the endless amount of sauces  Sauce heaven and endless flavors, I can't wait to try them all! Also, game changer, diced buffalo chicken tenders on their SALAD. Don't sleep on it- it's bomb!"}
{"text":"First timer here and am please to say I was greeted with a smile and some great recommendations on the flavors to try. Portions are healthy, no anemic wings here!  Easy in and out, clean, fast too! Portions were seasoned well and fried to perfection! Would definitely recommend a visit and am sure you'd be glad you did."}
{"text":"Idk where to start, I feel like my boyfriend moved around the corner for this place. Their chicken wings are massive and seasoned to perfection!!! Literally come here at least once a week. They never disappoint and the staff there is tight af."}
{"text":"If you are driving from AZ to Vegas (& vise versa) this is a great place to stop! Its not a chain, the woman working the register was extremely friendly. The chick was done perfect. Not overly seasoned. The best part is all the sauces they have"}
{"text":"My first time at the Chicken Shack great little concept lot of fun good energy very tasty food. I ordered the Cajun wings as well as lemon pepper with celery sticks and carrots instead of fries; to stay healthy. Then they gave me a nice little sampling of the damn hot sauce with habanero and jalapeno ground up chili great kit great flavor really enjoy this place I will be back."}
{"text":"Well my first time at the chicken shack SUCKED not due to taste, however, due to the fact that The CHICKEN Shack was out of CHICKEN FINGERS. How could their staff allow for this to happen? Use a better inventory system"}
{"text":"By far my favorite place to go for fried chicken. My family and I have been going here for years. I'm a regular and my usual is the #3 with garlic parmesan and ranch but I have branched out and tried other flavors as well and I love almost all of them.   If you're in the mood for some good chicken fingers or wings, this is the place to go! Also, if you're there later in the day be sure to say \"hi\" to Zeke."}
{"text":"This place is not bad. My wife were on vacation in Vegas and wanted some wings. Tired of buffets! So we went here, the place is not far from the strip. The place is in a strip mall. We walk in and didn't know what to expect, we found this place on yelp and decided to give this place a try. We ordered some wings, fingers, fries and coleslaw. The wings were good but a little salty for my taste, the fingers were bad had to chew on them for hours before I could swallow the darn thing, will not order fingers again! Coleslaw was bland nothing to rave about. The fries were good, string fries. The tables were not clean. The hot sauce and ketchup bottle was crusty. The workers looked high from smoking weed. This place has good wings but I guess it's a hit or miss with the sauce you choose. Will I go here again, probably yes. I will give them another try."}
{"text":"Went one time and got fried chicken and fries combo. Chicken had a nice crispness but was sooooo salty it was kind of hard to eat. I would go again because I have heard good things, so it's worth giving a try."}
{"text":"I like that i have the option to do grill or friend chicken. The portion sizes are great for the prize, especially compared to caines. The sauces are the best haberno honey is so good. Also really like the fry sauce. I recommend to call ahead because there is always a wait."}
{"text":"Took a bit of a drive to visit Chicken Shack and I am glad I did.  I walked in and looked at the menu and thought to myself that I could put down a 5 piece chicken fingers easy so I better get some wings to back them up. The portions here are huge and they also have the best fingers I've had in town so far. I was delighted. I love Fried Chicken so much that I drive to L.A. just to eat at Roscoe's, The Chicken Lady, and KyoChon. I am happy this place is here because I would have to drive to L.A. for it too.  Thank you Jaime W. for letting me in on your little secret. I'm hooked, I need to come back here again."}
{"text":"Stopped in Tuesday evening, had the garlic parmesan chicken wings, delicious. I have been to many other locations that served wings and this one became my favorite, more meat than any others. Nice patio to sit and enjoy your meal and wonderful staff"}
{"text":"Best chicken place in Vegas!!! You get a lot of food for $10 and you can taste the quality. Every time I go there they never disappoint!"}
{"text":"The chicken was good but the fries are thin and get cold fast,for what little food you get.. its pretty pricey. But at least we can say we have tried this place out."}
{"text":"The guys behind the counter are really nice and the sauces were delicious: spicy ranch and sweet chili had just the right amount of heat.  However, my chicken tenders (which they did give me extras of! Very nice) were unevenly cooked and pretty dry. I had to douse them in sauce to chew them. As nice as the service was, I would expect a place that specializes in chicken tenders to ensure that their tenders weren't dry....so unfortunately even though the sauces, thin matchstick French fries, and service were excellent, I wouldn't return to this place.m"}
{"text":"Yelp marked my previous review as \"not recommend\" maybe because they thought it was fake.   It wasn't, but you can't contact yelp, so I'm adding another.  The Chicken Shack is definitely worth the 5-star I gave it on the first review. This is the best chicken I have ever eaten. Fast and delicious. Great dipping sauces for the chicken. I like Sweet Chili and Spicy Blue Cheese sauce.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't a head turner either.    The chicken strips are large white meat pieces and the wings are large and breaded.  It just seemed plain to me.  I wasn't told until I finished ordering that I can pick the flavor sauce I want to add to my chicken.  First time here, so I had no idea.  I paid extra for a larger ranch, fry sauce, and spicy blue cheese.    The double cheeseburger was large and delicious. I would have that again.   The location is clean and well stocked.  The girls were cleaning and stocking what was already pretty tidy while we were there."}
{"text":"I walked 2 miles up the street from my house to try this place, I went on my daily walk and I ordered three fingers with fries and a drink. They gave me 4 instead of 3, not a complaint there. The chicken is delicious and the fingers are huge portions, they are huge, the fries were ok, very thin but still fries lol. I ate two and was full. Regardless I shared the rest with boyfriend, he liked them too, the sauces are great, lots of variety for sauces, you can pick two with any combo and they are bigger cups. Definitely enough ssauce for your meal. I would say, worth it!"}
{"text":"I have to say that I am VERY picky when it comes to my french fries and let me tell you I fell in love with these fries at first taste! I got 3 wings and 3 fingers with fries and a drink. I had a very hard time getting through 2 wings and a chicken finger because I filled up on the amazing fries! I cant wait to come back and try another one of their sauces"}
{"text":"One of my favorite quick stops. 10 minutes and I am on my way with 20 chicken tenders that are awesome with there sauces.  And not to mention the large french fries come in a huge box."}
{"text":"Always a pleasant and satisfactory meal at chicken shack, this time was no difference. Had the #1 wings with jerk sauce on the side, perfectly cooked and delicious. Partner had the #2 finger meal, a bit over cooked but overall satisfied. Cheap beer, cheap wings, good sauce. Nothing else to say but bring some towelettes. Recommend wing sauce on side if you are taking out."}
{"text":"This place is SO GOOD!!! This is actually the first place ive ate wings since I moved to Vegas a few years ago. And danggg i'm so happy I live right around the corner!!!! Hubby and I tried the medium sauce wings.  The wings are a nice size, super juicy, perfect amount of breading/crunch. Also the sauce was PERFECT!!! Only issue was No dipping sauce was included with our to-go order (perhaps you are supposed to tell them you want some; we were never even asked if we wanted any) Normally I'd detract a star for something like this. But the wings were so good that it honestly wasn't a huge deal not having anything to dip them in.  This is def my new wing spot!!! Cant wait to try their tenders :)"}
{"text":"Food was just okay.  Service was blah. Ordered large 25 wings with large fries and 3 drinks. Even tipped the cashier (even though there is no reason to. ..they don't do anything)and when we sat down we saw that there was a family meal-exactly what we got-but with another side and 1 more drink that was cheaper.  She's didn't even bother to suggest it to us. When she brought the food over I asked her and all she did was shake her head. Horrible customers service! They could have saved me money. .."}
{"text":"Excellent chicken wings. Made from fresh not frozen. Chicken salad also excellent. Big enough to split. Superb shoestring french fries.. wish they would sell just a half order of chicken tenders and french fries at half the regular price. Portions too big"}
{"text":"I've been going to the Sunset location for 2-3 years. They have in my opinion have some of the best wings. I was excited to see that a new location was opening closer to my neighborhood.  Like other reviewers said, this location is not as busy as the Sunset location, which is nice. I ordered take-out on a Sunday and when I went to pick it up, there were only two tables of people inside. I usually get bone-in wings tossed in Sweet Chili and Habanero Honey sauce with a large coleslaw. Their wings are super crispy, just how I like them! Service is also better than the other location, but that might be because this location is not as busy as the other one. Anyways, go try their wings! you won't regret."}
{"text":"I can't thing of anything bad I've had here. Always been a pretty good experience. In fact now I think I'm hungry lol. I always feel like it's a tad bit over priced when checking out but remember that's it's worth it once I eat."}
{"text":"Great wings... WAY better than BWW and cheaper too.  Very small place so be prepared to share a table or get it to go."}
{"text":"Looked long and hard to find some good, home-cookin'-type fried chicken wings like back home in Chicago, and I found them. I work in the area, and I hate it when I hear someone say they're going here for a lunch run, 'cause I have to put in an order! And the best part? They're consistently good and fresh. The fries are still hot by the time they get back to the office. The service is always quick, no matter how crowded it is. This is how a business should be run. LOVE LOVE this place. Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"Always juicy AF and crispy at the same time , pretty sure its witchcraft but love is love with the way their hot AF chicken - Now I gotta to order ..I'm out and hungry AF"}
{"text":"Taste like moms fried chicken Yummy! And who could beat the $1 draft beer, great baked beans and mustard potato salad. (Why do most people make it mayo? It's just not right.) The family was divided on which sauce is the best. Top picks: chili lime, honey BBQ, Jamaican Jerk. Oh and my daughter believes the tea rates right up there with good southern tea."}
{"text":"Thinking about wings to hang with my son and instead of Buffalo Wild Wings, we to Chicken Shack based on yelp review from Bethany E.  She gave it a five star and I am glad we tried it!  a.  Location - In a funky odd strip mall near to the great Ross J Aloha Grill!  Plenty of parking and space.  This is a very small place that can seat perhaps 30 people approximately.  b.  The fare - Here you can get hamburger, chicken strips, chili and the famous chicken wings.  You can buy by quantity or in combos.  We decided the 25 piece for 22.89 and also the fries.   c.  The taste - Nice and plump wings with a crispy textured coating. Very nice. Not greasy or anything, just right. The sauces come in a variety of flavors that are given to you free based on the quantity you order.   d.  The extras - If you want something like ranch or blue cheese, this will cost you like .39c per small cup.  Odd, but okay.  The veggies of carrots and celery cost you and is considered a side.  They have small and large side portions including macaroni salad and potato salad.  I am sure there were other things I am missing here as I was focused on the wings.  e.  Speaking of wings - Further to my comments, I did like the wings, however, the ratio of drum sticks to the wing portion was about 3-1 and I prefer the wing portion with the two bones.  f.  A following - When we walked in, we were the only people here. After five minutes, the place was packed!  I say, check this place out. It is not bad at all and for the good ole wing craving, this is a well priced and tasty place."}
{"text":"My wife and I love to find \"hole-in-the-wall\" type restaurants.  Unfortunately there aren't a lot of those in the vegas area.  So many are large franchises and corporate style.    Finding Chicken Shack was a thrill!  Not only did it have the small local feel we were looking for, but their chicken strips are hands down the best we have had! The staff was also very friendly and accommodating.  The fry on the chicken is great, and their shoe string fries are delicious.  They have a HUGE selection of sauces you can use for dipping. They also tend to be very generous in proportions!  We've been back many times and take out of town friends there as well.  Love it!"}
{"text":"IF YOU LIKE DRY CHICKEN this is the place for you! I really wanted to love this place because the staff was really great and I've been looking for a solid chicken joint but...  It is a sin for chicken to be dry and overcooked in such a place. First time, we were excited to try it. First bite, we both looked at each other with that \"dog gone it\" kind of look. We both knew it was a fail. I got the number 4 - wings, fingers and fries. Wings were breaded which is a crime against humanity. Sauce was ok, but the fingers were dry and overcooked. I ate one wing and one finger and tossed it all. Waste of time and money.  Such a let down. Fries were good. I don't see myself coming back. I mean I knew it wasn't exactly healthy as everything is fried but I at least was hoping for good unhealthy food."}
{"text":"Wow good.  Not to diminish the Chicken, but the French Fries are out of this world.  Hardest choice in ordering is what type of sauce for your wings and fingers - there are so many choices."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE!!! we usually go to the location on sunset, today we tried out the one on valley verde. The younger Hawaiian lady wig a piercing by her eye.... worst attitude. Had nothing to say but \"nope\" in the snarkiest way with the snarkiest look. Pulled out a few singles to leave a tip... suddenly her attitude changed because she saw the cash in my hand. lol she thought it was gonna go into her tip jar?? NOPE!!!! not after her attitude. Won't be coming to this location again that's forsure. the only reason i'm giving this 2 stars is because of the food."}
{"text":"Nice place clean peaceful! Simple menu basic itens that go with a chicken Joint!! Customer service is A1 very attentative, all smiles, food brought to the table. Food came out very short time 1. Fresh 2. Hot 3. And tasty dont wanna cant complicate a place like this.... ill be back to the shack!!!"}
{"text":"So glad we found this place on the way to Hoover Dam from Vegas! So good and the staff was so friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This place  sucks.   if you're going to go to a Chicken Shack don't go to this one my girl found a bug in her salad and they claim they wash the salad three times then I went there one time and they threw some chicken fingers in the grease that look like they were already cooked they don't batter them fresh like the one in Boulder City this is a knock off location and they don't even give you the card for if you buy 10 free meals to get one free they're a bunch of rip off please Choose Wisely 0 Stars if there were available."}
{"text":"The best chicken fingers ever! Tasty, perfectly breaded and perfectly fried! Great portions at great prices! If I come to Hoover Dam again, I sure will stop by and grab some of those tasty chicken fingers!"}
{"text":"We loved the food. quantity and quality of the food is really good.  Service is prompt."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick dinner with a friend. The line was pretty short, but I waited for over 10 minutes to put my order in. The cashier was fantastic, but the trainer looked like she kept getting in the way of what she was doing. the girl with the short hair working night looks miserable a lady thought her combo came with fries and an employee told her he would get her fries she came back up 10 mins later asking and made her pay for them ? horrible customer service from her."}
{"text":"We love chicken shack! It was our first visit to this location and it's been the best so far! We are in love with the fry sauce to the point where we could almost drink it right out of the cup! The chicken tenders always come our fresh, hot and huge! Their ranch is to die for! We also just tried the honey garlic sauce on the wings and there's no coming back from that one #honeygarlicforlife so dang good! So excited that this location is literally 2 mins from our new place so we will be able to go often!"}
{"text":"This place is new to my neighborhood and was recommended by a friend, it is a very clean place, lots of seating although parking is a little limited directly in front of this location but not a big deal. I ordered the 5 piece chicken fingers with medium sauce on them and was pleasantly surprised to see the fingers were actually enormous!! I could have actually gone with just 3 and been completely full. The sauce was just right on the fingers themselves but would have been even better if I had remembered to ask for Ranch or Bleu Cheese dipping sauce . The chicken was very moist which you usually dont find with most chicken fingers. I am looking forward to going back and trying their wings next!"}
{"text":"Ordered the combo from uber eats. That's a pretty good size for me. I like the chicken wings better than the fingers. Fingers are too dry."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday night craving some wings. For two people we ordered 3 orders of the 6 piece wings because the orders either came in 6, 12 or 25 with nothing in between. We got the creamy garlic Parmesan, chipotle bbq and hot honey garlic.   Wings came out relatively fast and they are actually really big!  My favorite flavor was the hot honey garlic. A little spicy and a little sweet. The chipotle bbq was sweet as well. I liked it but I'm not sure if chipotle is supposed to be sweet or not.   I was expecting something a little more savory and Smokey. The garlic Parmesan was also good but it got a little heavy towards the end. I'm glad we had other flavors to break up the taste.   I will definitely come back here again as wings are big and well priced and the flavors are pretty good!"}
{"text":"I do love me some chicken shack.   This place has some really great fried chicken, but what sets them apart is their expansive sauce selection. My personal favorite being the honey bbq and hot bbq. Their fries are also just amazing.   My only one complaint is that the chicken isnt always consistent. At times their chicken can be very chewy, and not so easy to eat. I would say I experience this about  one out every three or four visits. Thus why I have not been dining there as much lately.   When their chicken is good its a 5 star place, but with the inconsistency I can only give them 4."}
{"text":"My family and I were headed to the movie theater in the same shopping center as this joint, so we decided to give it a try for dinner before hand. The service is pretty good. Their chicken is great. You can tell it is fresh and made from scratch. They have many sauce options for wings and the fingers. It was a neat experience and the next time we catch a movie nearby we will stop in again."}
{"text":"Before the movies today, my work team decided to have some lunch at the chicken shack.  I've heard some good things about their chicken so I was excited!  When you get there, you'll notice two picnic tables outside for additional seating.  I don't know if the tables are constantly cleaned, but it looked sticky and dusty.  When you get inside, there are tables on both sides of the restaurant:  two tops, four tops and 6 top tables. The inside seemed the same type of cleanliness as the outside tables.  Just looked sticky and a little dirty.  It looks like a small place, however, they seem to be efficient.  A lot of people were there but we fortunately got a few tables fast.  The staff was really nice, a guy and a girl in the front.  They were really busy but kept professional and nice.    For the food, we literally got about 150 pieces of chicken:  100 wings and 50 chicken tenders and a bunch of fries for about $150.  We got a lot of different flavors and sauces on the chicken.  Mild and medium heat chicken wings/tenders, lemon pepper wings and my favorite, garlic Parmesan wings.  The wings are super crispy and juicy inside.  I ate a bunch of wings and they were all cooked perfectly.  The garlic Parmesan really had a lot of flavor and no overly salty.  ON POINT!!!  The lemon pepper flavor wasn't overpowering and managed to still shine through.  I REALLY liked the chicken.  Definitely would recommend the food to someone else!  All in all, we ordered way too many wings for our group of people today.  We literally ended up wasting a bunch of wings because we were going to the movies right after and didn't want to leave the food in the car during the movies.  Aside from that, I was definitely a happy customer and think the wings were great!  Will be back for more :)"}
{"text":"Chicken Shack is a fun stop for wings, fries and chicken tenders. Meaty wings with lots of sauce choices. Habanero honey sauce has a sweet spicy kick. Crispy shoestring fries with a side of ranch dressing round out a meal. Chicken fingers are hearty with fried chicken coating. Friendly staff. Drive up, walk in and order, then take a seat while perusing the license plates."}
{"text":"Anybody who grew up in the area knows Chicken Shack is a staple. Great food for the money you pay, plus they're lightning quick with getting your food out to you. Even on days the line stretches to the door, I've never had to wait more than 10 minutes to get my food. Often enough, they have it ready before I can even put the lid on my drink.   The ranch is top-notch, as are their fries. And quite often, you'll get more than what you ordered."}
{"text":"The food was great but the service was terrible. The cashier told my friend that we had to take our food to go because they're closing in 40 minutes. Then when I was about to order she had the nerve to have a whole conversation with her boyfriend on the phone before talking to me, haha."}
{"text":"My chicken was so good.  I got the Habenaro honey and the lemon pepper. I thought the habenero could have had some kick to it, but it was good.  My family also enjoyed there's.  They don't have a Chicken shack in there city, they said they want to always come here when they visit."}
{"text":"I didn't realize they had several around town.  I was excited for this place to open.  So we finally decided to check it out.  We ordered 6 piece with fries.  I got the Teriyaki sauce and the really hot sauce (Damn Hot) It was hot.  I can usually take some heat, but I had to push this sauce away.  It had good flavor, it was just too daym hot!  I didn't care for the hot teriyaki sauce.  But it worked out just fine, that chicken is fried just right.  My only complaint, is they need to cut back a little bit on the salt.  It's almost too salty. The service here is really good.  They make sure you have everything you need.  Ohhhh, and don't forget to get your rewards card!"}
{"text":"Loved this place.  Awesome big juice and crispy chicken wings and all white meat tenders.  If you like a bit of spice, have have habanero honey sauce.  Amazing.  Fries are crispy shoestring.  Busy place to prepare to be patient to find a table to seat yourself at.  Worth the wait."}
{"text":"Crispy, delicious chicken and crispy skinny fries! Large selection of sauces to choose from. I would definitely come here again to get my chicken fix"}
{"text":"Yelp told me this place was hot and new.   If by hot they mean completely over cooked and dry chicken band burnt buns, and new they mean completely new to the operating of a fryer... Then sure. This place is hot and new.   The only thing remotely redeeming is the fries. Thin cut and crispy... So really burnt but I like crispy fries."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal.  Nice thick fresh pieces of chicken fingers.  The sauces are fresh and great variety.  Under new ownership and service is fast. I'll be here often and a great alternative to the commercial Chick Filet."}
{"text":"There must be 15 restaurants on this street, all fast food except a hot dog shack and this chicken joint.  Luckily, my friend insisted on Jack in the Box, so after checking Yelp and seeing a completely 5 star rating with over 100 reviews, I happily crossed the street to see what the fuss was about.    They have a large menu with quite a bit of variety.  I wasn't extremely hungry, so I looked for the smallest thing on the menu - I ordered 5 chicken tenders.  Wow, I got 5 huge, almost the size of a small breast, chicken tenders.  I could only eat two and a half, and we took the rest on the road.  I ordered the Chipotle BBQ sauce which was amazing.  What I liked best was the chicken was very lightly breaded before frying, it was very flavorful with enough crunch and I didn't fill up on breading.  It also felt slightly healthier than fried chicken should be.  Best of all, the flavor was off the charts.    I got my food so quickly that I met my friend back at Jack in the Box just as he was sitting down to eat.  I let him sample my chicken first, then listened to him say \"I wish I ordered that\" while he ate his burger and tacos.  I would surely visit again next time I'm in the area.  If you're visiting Hoover Dam, you have to stop here to eat."}
{"text":"Some of the best chicken fingers in town . The dipping sauces are amazing . Mom and pop style fast food that is excellent."}
{"text":"Once again my fellow yelpers are spot on with this place, super friendly service and super good chicken.when you first go into a place you have never been to the one thing you most appreciated as a friendly welcome and a great smile. Put that together with some great food and you have the makings of a great restaurant, most definitely will return on my next trip down definitely five stars for me enjoy"}
{"text":"This place was so good! The fries were super skinny, fresh and delicious! I got a 5 piece and it was way to much for us to share! The chicken pieces were so big! It was nice sitting outside to eat. Come try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"We really liked this place. Order the sauce on the side. We tired the fingers, wings, fries, and potato salad, ranch, bbq and fry sauce  It was great and we had it to go which is so not the same as eating in!  Defiantly will go back!"}
{"text":"Okay....Friday night....After work...Hungry. I ordered the 5 piece tenders with chili cheese fries.  I'm disappointed. The mild sauce is kinda sweet, with a strange mustard taste, gross! And they drowned the tenders in sauce and don't separate the chicken and fries...Who does that?! The chicken is dipped, so separate it. The fries are those annoying little  shoestring fries. We didn't get any ranch with our order...Guess you have to ask for it. Hopefully they improve. I was excited to have a new chicken place in the area, they missed the mark."}
{"text":"Best chicken fingers in town, noisy always crowded at noon but food is good hot and plentiful!! I'm never disappointed plus they take good care of regulars!"}
{"text":"Great place.  Always consistent with food.  Sauces are great...be sure to try the 'Damn Hot'."}
{"text":"Based on my first experience I this place gets four stars. It could swing either way though. The chicken sandwich was very tasty. The fries are the second best I've had next to Sammie's LA pastrami. It is a little pricey $8.10 for my sandwich. The honey BBQ actually taste like it has honey in it. Once I've tried more I will probably change this review."}
{"text":"This place has really good food. We used to come here all the time when we lived down the street. We went there today after not going for a long time. We were super excited! We walked in there and the place was disgusting. Chicken bones, straw wrappers, utensils, fries, sticky floors, the soda machine was gross, the tables etc etc..it was so bad we walked out and went somewhere else. On top of all of this, their health card wasn't posted anywhere. I know it's a bunch of young high school kids working there, but come on."}
{"text":"We were on a road trip from California to Colorado. We tried the Chicken Shack in Boulder City. Wow. It was the most delicious chicken ever. They had a great variety of dipping sauces that I absolutely loved. They made their cole slaw just like my Mom. Fresh. Crisp. Couldn't get enough. *Very very clean place and especially nice people. We CRAVE their food. Love the place!"}
{"text":"I've gone here since high school, our volleyball team would come before or after games, especially after playing GV. Nice small town feel, and SO. Delicious. Skinny fries seasoned to perfection, wings, fingers, FRESH! Annnnnnd THE SAUCES I'm drooling thinking about it, they even have beer!! Happy to find out they have one near my new side of town!"}
{"text":"Stopped here while passing through based on the awesome reviews.  I'd give this place more stars if I could!  Great food and great service!"}
{"text":"I'm going to make this plain and simple. Don't get your wings tossed in sauce here. Keep the sauces on the side and dip your chicken rather than having it all over. They do not try to be like wing stop or BBW and we should all respect that. But they offer tossing you sauce for you anyway. Also another tip don't eat here it's small and busy so it's best to get in line order Togo and take it home. I love their chicken wings and dipping sauces Mild sauce and sweet chili and garlic Parmesan are my go to sauces but I will try more next time. The wings are a good size and cooked perfectly. They don't overcook it like BBW to the point where you get a mini wing. One of my fave spots to stop when I'm on this side for sure. They seem to be putting out a great product but I think they need more space to operate more smoothly."}
{"text":"Great service but the taste is lacking a little.   It's located in the huge galaxy theater plaza and can be very easy to miss. The vibe of the place is pretty cool. The cook and the cashier are on top of everything and they run it efficiently. It's a small place, and at peak hours you can expect to wait for a table. Prices are average.  I ended up getting the five piece chicken finger in the lemon pepper, tasted okay but nothing stellar. I think you'd be better off getting some of the more wet sauces such as honey bbq."}
{"text":"There was a lot of hype about this place but it wasn't that great. The only great thing about it is that the wings I brought home were hot (about a 15 min drive). They forgot the 2 ranches I paid for, the wings were 75% batter, and the \"hot\" sauce was supposed to be Frank's Hot sauce but instead I got mild. Also, if you go on Wednesday it's wing Wednesday but they don't have a sign with the 85 cent special."}
{"text":"I am just going to say that this is the Best Chicken wing spot i have ever ate at. We have had both the tenders and the Wings. I did have a burger here and I will say it was quite dry. But its not a burger place. I go to this spot a lot. It is on way to work, I order on way stop in and head back out to work. Once they get to know you it is like family when you go in here. (customer service is job one here. the parking lot has been under construction due to smith's new gas station so it has been a bit inconvenient getting in and out. They are always busy so that is a good sign. Chicken, Josie likes the Garlic Parmesan I am a fan of the regular wings. If you order in they have beer on tap as well. This Chicken is so crunchy and juicy. Big wings with a ton of meat. You can also order sauces to go with you. I like that they offer blue cheese as well as ranch.  I go back again and again. You need to try this place. I believe they have other locations, however I have only been here. They know me by name so what's not to like."}
{"text":"Awesome wings and fingers! Everyone was very nice. The garlic Parmesan wings are fantastic."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Wings were wonderful. Ask for the bathroom key for a good laugh. The staff was very friendly!"}
{"text":"Always good service during the day but always have troubles at night, online it says they close at 10 but they close at 9 actually as if business hours on here I was upset when I drove 15 mins to get here"}
{"text":"I am NOT a chicken finger fan but I wanted to try out a new place in town. It's been there for a while but is not the most convenient location. This just became a favorite.  I have the chicken fingers and my son had the wings. He wore the sauce from ear to ear. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Best hand breaded chicken ever!  The tenders are large and the fries are amazing!  Their ranch dip is creamy too. YUM"}
{"text":"Love this place, it's close to work so we are regulars. Chicken is awesome and they are big wings. Only warning is, if you want to dine in get there before 1130 the place gets packed"}
{"text":"Good food, friendly staff, nice atmosphere, if you're in the neighborhood of Valle Verde or Sunset stop in, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"So we had ordered 12 wings. It took them less than ten mins and there it was for us. Who would've known she would go home from work as she could not stop hurling and having diarrhea.  Will be in contact with the health department soon as they should look at proper techniques to cook safely."}
{"text":"Chicken fingers are AMAZING. Friendly staff. Great chili cheese fries! Try the spicy blue cheese!! Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I've tried fingers all over the place, and The Chicken Shack has the best. The breading is light and crunchy and the fingers are huge. Worth the drive for the best fingers and wings!"}
{"text":"Not from here but i can say that i will be making a stop at the Chicken Shack every time i visit here. Employees have great attitudes and the food was incredible. Overall good atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Great service, great chicken, great variety of sauces. Love pretty good French fries."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and great food! I do recommend this place to others. The fries are not too salty which is good. My bf took me to this place, my first time. I love the chicken fingers and the medium buffalo sauce on the side. :)"}
{"text":"Delicious, plump chicken fingers.  Tasty sauces.  The best I have ever had.  Chick fil a should take note of the size of these chicken fingers."}
{"text":"There food is great customer service is terrible went in there and the cashier didn't even bother to give us our change 20 dollars in change instead she felt the need to just put our change in the tip jar and we totally forgot about it then we went back and she had an attitude about giving me back my money so yeah watch out make sure to ask for your change because she'll try to finest you !!!!"}
{"text":"My friend Mike bragged about what great meaty wings they had and he wasn't lying. Wings were great and staff was warm and friendly."}
{"text":"Geez! I am pretty positive this is the right location. I stopped in to get a to go order while running errands...oil change etc. I don't remember the young pretty girl that helped me maybe she was wearing a name tag and I forgot or didn't pay attention but she was very nice and helpful. Thank you so much for great service. If I am around town I will have to check out other chicken shakes. I am almost certain this was the location on my side of town. Thank you."}
{"text":"Attention: Business Owner - special commendation for your employee Samantha. She was extremely patient even though I was very short with my questions. She explained your menu very patiently and I am impressed. A bit embarrassed with my behavior but really admire her calmness. She's an asset to your team!!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Chicken is great and had their burger for first time which was awesome. The thing I noticed most is how friendly the staff is, always a hi, how you doing?, and how was your meal?  EVERY TIME! Customer service is huge with me and I appreciate that the most."}
{"text":"Yum! Chicken is tasty and love the sauces, although two of the BBQ sauces tasted exactly the same. The honey habanero sauce was excellent; should be called honey habanero BBQ sauce though because that's more what it tasted like. Great for a chicken fix since I don't have Chick-Fil-A! Fries are good, too. Nothin to make a big fuss about, just a solid take on a staple. :)"}
{"text":"Holy macoroni! This place is delicious! My favorite wings are the honey bbq and lemon pepper. Their fries are absolutely delicious if you enjoy shoestring style! I will definitely be eating here again!"}
{"text":"Great fast friendly service.  The chicken is amazing. Super fresh and tasty.  I had the medium wings \"flats are the best\" with the Parmesan garlic sprinkled on them.  Absolutely delicious.  Also got to try the fingers with sweet and sour sauce and hot BBQ.  Also wonderful. I'm not usually a big fan of white meat. But these fingers were so juicy and tender I couldn't help but to devour them.  Fries. Don't get me started.  The shoestring fries are fantastic. I recommend having them with tons of pepper.  They were great."}
{"text":"One of our favorite joints! Had a slight hiccup with our last order and was disappointed cause we love them so much! But, they fixed it quickly! I'm a happy customer again... -Erica"}
{"text":"Make sure your order is prepared fresh. Ordered a 25 wing meal from the location on Sunset and Green Valley Pkwy. My order was over the phone and my first clue should have been when the person taking my order said that \"my order would be ready in 6 minutes\". The chicken was dry and obviously filled w/ old wings!! Chicken would have potentially been better if fresh??!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately my first visit, I had to get a takeout order but the order came out pretty fast!  Their wings are HUGE!!! And they hook it up! Well worth the money!  At first when I walked in, I didn't feel welcome. They didn't greet me so I had to greet them lol.  And I proceeded to order my wings awkwardly. But after I paid, they offered me a water cup while I wait, and told me I can get any fountain drink I wanted! How nice of them  If you order a side of ranch or any sauce their sauce cups are huge so it's easy to dip the wings and portion is a lot too.   I'll be back to dine in soon, especially they have cheap beer too :)"}
{"text":"Good wing place.  Small hole in the wall next to smiths.  It's always packed so we like to call in ahead of time.  Wings are huge and they are breaded then fried, very filling.  We normally get the extra hot wings, jerk, and the mango habanero.  Honestly the place could use a good scrubbing and cleaning.  It's a little run down and dirty... but service is always good and it's always tasty. Lol"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for over 10 years now! Boy, do I feel old. There chicken never disappoints, whether you want fingers, wings or even both. There is a ton of different sauces to choose from and they are continuously adding new ones to try. For my money, it's the best chicken place around. My orders here are very eclectic, but I'd say my favorite is the Hot BBQ with a side of Hot teriyaki and spicy bleu cheese. It might sound a little strange, but even if you're just dipping their delicious fires in the teriyaki, it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"Words can't explain how hyped I am to have a Chicken Shack down the street from my place. As an avid fried chicken lover (it's seriously my guilty pleasure), I was always willing to make the drive to the other locations except now it's literally three minutes away! Today my boyfriend (who has never had it before) and I went to try it and the quality is definitely the same as the other locations. The only difference is the customer service. The customer service was never bad at the other locations but it never stood out either. The customer service was 10/10 from every person working there. If you weren't a good mood about eating chicken before, you will be now after seeing all of their happy smiles! I got the 6 piece wings with hot sauce on the side and my boyfriend ordered the 10 piece fingers (boneless), half being lemon pepper and half being chilli lime. We also got a side of ranch with french fries. The portions are huge and neither of us could finish! It was a super satisfying meal and I'm so excited to have this establishment down the street!"}
{"text":"Khloe, Thank you for getting back to me.  To be clear,  I had Chipotle BBQ on the side, and 1 Blue cheese. When asked about the charge for the blue cheese, the cashier said we make it ourselves. I had nothing extra. When she presented the wings at my table in such a short time,  i asked if they were precooked, she offered to ask the kitchen,  but i declined as I already knew the answer"}
{"text":"Chicken shack is a great place to grab some wings. All the sauces are excellent and the chicken is phenomenal. The best in Vegas. If they could brake the habit of serving old fries (cause we know the difference) then they would be a 5 star spot. I'd rather wait a few more minutes for fresh fries rather than fast food with old fries.  Other than that we are 3 years loyal."}
{"text":"This is a small chicken place that I thought must be worth a try considering I still love a good chicken finger meal.  The shop itself is small but really cute.  I enjoyed the \"chicken\" sayings that were painted on the walls throughout the shop.  Definitely good for a laugh while waiting for your food.   The shop certainly wasn't clean as a whistle.  But the service was nothing to complain about.    I didn't enjoy my chicken fingers.  Breading was not as crispy as I prefer and the finger itself was just... eh.  I did enjoy the shoestring fries.    It's not exactly the same but while I was there I just kept thinking, \"If a Raising Cane's were closer I would have just gone there.\"    I'd go again and try more stuff but it probably won't come to mind over other lunch joints."}
{"text":"I decided to go here for lunch because my coworkers encouraged me to because they are familiar with the establishment. The owners do business with my company so my peers frequent there. HOWEVER, my experience was not good at all. The owner Melissa was very curt and  unengaging to say the least. I was not greeted at all, almost like I was disturbing the convo she was having with her husband.  I place my order and she asked what kind of sauce I wanted and I asked her what were my options she motioned with her head toward the menu....... the rest of the interaction was very rushed, mind you I was the only customer there until I finished placing my order and a 4 kids came in and were greeted almost immediately! Needless to say I will not patronize a business that doesn't respect and treat all customers the same. Customer service shouldn't be selective......"}
{"text":"I had to visit the Chicken Shack because I was craving their chicken fingers. I've been here a few times before, but I finally took the time to visit again and write a review.  Inside, the walls are decorated with license plates from different states. It has a pretty cool feel to the place, but it can get crowded given the fact that it is small.  Since I was buying food to feed 4 people, I ordered the shack pack (your choice of 25 wings OR 20 fingers, two large sides, and 4 drinks for $34.99). I opted for the chicken fingers and chose the macaroni salad, potato salad, and the coleslaw for my sides (I decided to get an extra side item instead of the 4 drinks).   The chicken is supposed to be their showcase item, but it ended up being more of a letdown. The fingers are a good size for what you pay for and they're juicy when you bite into them, but the fingers I got tasted like they had been cooking in old oil (it wasn't that pretty golden-brown color, but more on the darker brown side). The sides were alright. The macaroni salad and potato salad were the better of the sides. Unfortunately, the coleslaw looked like it was put in a blender before serving. It was more on the sweet side and really watery.  They didn't deliver on the wow factor, but I'm willing to give Chicken Shack another chance."}
{"text":"Best fingers you will find. Lots of meat, lightly breaded and full of flavor with plenty of sauces to choose from."}
{"text":"BEST CHICKEN EVER.  My family and I eat here at least twice a month. I'm addicted to the Damn hot sauce!! They are always very polite and also very quick. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The sauces are the best part and the chicken is amazing. I tried garlic Parmesan and sweet chili and I recommend both. I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Chicken shack is amazing! Our go to place for chicken and wings! Casual ambience. Quite the hole in the wall place.   Chicken shack is a great treat. They have an amazing variety of sauces and they all taste great!! This is the #1 wing place hands down. No question."}
{"text":"Great wings, fingers and FRIES!!! Cozy atmosphere.  You have a returning customer... Like mentioned... passed by many a times... and finally went in and yayyyyyyyy was satisfied....."}
{"text":"Wish I could give 3.5. I work right across the street from this little joint and had to try it on my lunch break. The service was good,  the woman hat took my order was very friendly and knew it was our first time. Prices are a bit high but no too bad. I got the fingers plain with fries, I like to try stuff like this without all the bells and sauces to really get a sense of the food. The fingers were big and hot (temperature), but they weren't very crispy and the actual chicken part was a tad dry. The fry portion was huge and tasty, nice crispy little fries.  I really want to try their wings, sauces sounded good and wings other patrons had looked pretty good. I'll try it again."}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way home from AZ! The food was pretty delicious and the chicken actually stayed pretty warm until we got to our home which was like 45 mins away from here!  Thank you."}
{"text":"I had the number Two, five Chicken Fingers and Fries and I got potato salad instead of the fries. Also got the fingers rolled in the buffalo sauce.     Not what I really expected, first of all the the chicken the star of the dish was way over cooked, like it was cooked yesterday and just flashed cooked today, the chicken was tough and chewy.  The buffalo sauce was good and potato salad was very flavorful.  The bottom line chicken was over cooked, chewy and tasted old, possibly freezer burned.  I have them three stars because the last time it was much more fresher then this body, so next time will decide if we ever come back."}
{"text":"My husband brought home some wings and tenders with hot honey garlic sauce and fries. It was so yummy! Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"SALT SALT SALT- Not the normal flavor of Chicken Shack  I have eaten at all the Chicken Shacks all over Vegas. FINALLY one opened next to my home. The first time I ate there, I thought the chicken was off. It was exactly the same issue the second time.   The chicken taste like someone is adding TONS of SALT to their chicken.  I have asked other friends who have tried it and they all say the same thing. Chicken and Fries are just overloaded with salt and they all refuse to go back to this location.  Some bites of the chicken are crispy and tasting. Other bites taste like a salt pellet has been inserted into the chicken.  This location DOES NOT follow the Chicken Shack standards. I am telling everyone I know to post here in hopes that the Owner sees what is going on.  Change your ways, or I will not ever go back to this location and will tell everyone I know to avoid this place.  I would rather go across the street to Canes and get a better value and not be overloaded with salt.  JUST GROSS! I guess its time to go back to the Valle Verde location."}
{"text":"Chicken shack is always fresh and i really enjoy coming here more than canes. The meat really tastes like fresh chicken and not processed and that's what i really love about it"}
{"text":"So this was my first time here ever. So of course I was confused on what to order and the cashier was of no assistance and just confused me more. The food was very bland unfortunately but the french fries were good and the food came out very fast. It was 11 bucks just for myself so I would not go back. It just wasn't worth it to me."}
{"text":"Really good fried chicken and fries! I wish they were open 24 hrs like the spot next door because they are MUCH better. The service is pretty quick and the staff is friendly. This is my go to spot for fried chicken when I don't feel like making it."}
{"text":"Today was our first time trying the CHICKEN SHACK and let me tell you it was sooo good better than Raisin Cane's. The cashier was so great with us told us all about the menu and had such an amazing upbeat personality made us feel like he was a long lost brother. We felt welcomed and enjoyed the atmosphere of this jewel. Thank you to the cashier for an awesome experience don't recall your name but I will never forget someone genuinely kind hearted! Thank you again"}
{"text":"Chicken Shack offers great chicken for an affordable price! They really give you your money's worth. I got the combo with 5 chicken strips and shoe string fries. You get one dipping sauce for free and each one after that is $0.35 more. I got Habanero Honey and Sweet Chili which were both pretty awesome. The chicken strips are large and filling - I couldn't even finish all of it. They are cooked perfectly to a crisp! The shoestring fries were tasty as well :) I definitely recommend this place for a quick dine-in or pickup!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a chicken place and came across this one so we wanted to try it out. Tried their wings with the suace on the side and man were they nice and crispy!  Got it with the chicken tenders that were just as good. I got the mild sauce so I wasn't too happy because it was kinda spicy for me but i'm a wimp so it's ok but still was good. I loved their shoe string fries too! My bf had the hamburger and he loved it as well. The prices were reasonable. Only downside is that the place is small but other than that I'll come back to try the different sauces!"}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for chicken of the fried variety and you want it in the form of wings or fingers, The Chicken Shack might be what you're looking for. This location is the most convenient for us and we always receive friendly, helpful service, but I wouldn't put the chicken on the top of my list.  You can either get fingers, wings, or both via combo. Unlike other proteins, chicken always needs a little help to boost the flavor and with over 20+ choices for sauces, the spectrum is broad enough to meet anyone's palate. Their hottest, damn hot and what I usually order, is tolerable and allows you to still function after consumed. Cajun is probably my favorite of the rest. I have yet to try the burgers, salads, and chicken sandwich also offered on the menu. My daughter especially prefers the shoestring fries and sometimes bypasses the chicken just to get the fries.  I've given the tenders a couple of tries and both times they've been overcooked leaving the meat dry with inedible, tough edges. To me, the wings, although they are plump and above average in size, are their biggest downfall because they commit the mortal sin of coating each wing with breading. A crispy chicken skin is a delicacy providing that unique crunch and holding the salty, fatty chicken flavor. I'm disappointed when I see a wing that conceals that flavorful skin with breading.  The fries and service are strong points. The fingers and wings aren't my top choice, but I wouldn't tell anyone not to give them a try because they might make them how you prefer."}
{"text":"I went here because my friend suggested it. I was not impressed by the food or customer service. When we walked up to the counter, the cashier didn't even greet us or ask if we had questions about the menu. She just stared until I told her I was ready to order. She wasn't wearing a name tag, but according to the receipt, her name was \"Cheri\". I ordered 12 wings - half lemon pepper and half garlic parmesan. It was overly breaded and it looked like they just dumped the garlic parmesan on top. The coating didn't stick. They charged 59 cents for a small container of ranch. I don't think I'll come back for a second time."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this place! We'd been staying in Phoenix visiting family, and decided to do a road trip to vegas for a few days. On the way back to Phoenix, we were all starving for lunch but SO sick of fast food.. The chicken shack is indeed just a little shack, and not much to look at, but after reading the good reviews we decided to give it a try.. So glad we did!!! The fresh crispy breaded chicken strips were DELICIOUS, as well as the shoestring fries! Nothing was greasy. The fry sauce (ketchup & mayo) was perfect for dipping. Great little stop, don't pass it up!!!"}
{"text":"Im a little conflicted Ive always walked in and ordered but the other night after being sock for a week I called an hour before close and someone picked up the phone and prqctically snarledinto the phone \"we are not taking any more orders tonight\" I've never had someone in food service be so rude to me. I will NOT be calling for take out again."}
{"text":"My favorite chicken in Vegas. Chicken is not overly seasoned yet still favorable. Given a little more time, they will be as good as Sunset location."}
{"text":"My friend insisted that we try this place and I am glad we did. Sure the line was out the door but that is because the food is amazing. Quick service and chicken that is second to none. Do not let the line discourage you from missing out on the best chicken ever."}
{"text":"Being a vegetarian, every time I came to Smith's just next door I couldn't help but become overwhelmed by the awesome smell that came from this place. So, I had to bring mom to taste it and give me a full review.  She said the wings were awesome and would love to come back, but they weren't as good as hers. ;)  I also learned they have chicken tenders and will have to come and try those for myself, considering I have jumped off the veggie train after ten years and dying to  see if the taste matches the aroma. Come and check this hidden gem out if you are a fan of good chicken. My nostrils and Mom's taste buds are saying you probably will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"It's arrived early n the food r so gud I like it n so as my kids, they njoy eating it especially the fries ,this is a gud resturant please  stop by sometimes to try out their food thank you"}
{"text":"We came here with some locals.  Seriously the best chicken fingers I'd ever had.  So fresh and juicy!  They only have chicken and fries.  Definitely a proponent of the do one thing and do it well philosophy.  So, if you have a hankering for chicken, this is the place!"}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of this place. The food is way salty which is good for some people at some times(the bf loves salty ass food), but my firm belief is if you sell food, don't nickel and dime for stuff that makes YOUR food better. For example, making me pay a side price for some (veggie sticks)celery and carrots, ridiculous. Celery is literally a dollar for a giant bunch. Charging for ranch? At a dedicated chicken wing place? Wha??? I mean, where is any logic there?? If you want more than one type of sauce, charge. I mean really...  I am a frequent craver of chicken wings, fingers, anything crunchy and salty with some hot sauce and celery. The celery is a must. I still think it is  a travesty that some fast food pizza places have the audacity to serve wings and yet do not carry celery. I frequented this place a lot at first, but after a while spending over ten bucks a pop for a single meal just so I can get some celery and ranch with my meal is ridiculous. Now I just head over across to (casino takeout)...which is good but I would rather support small business."}
{"text":"Sorry Colonel Sanders, but Chicken Shack does chicken right.  My family is so hooked on this place.  I love the chicken fingers, the wife loves the wings, and the kids are split down the middle.  And you gotta try the honey BBQ sauce.  Nothing better than drowning my chicken fingers in that deliciously sweet nectar from the gods.  They have very generous portions too, giving my late night cravings something to look forward too.  See you soon Chicken Shack.  =)"}
{"text":"Best chicken place in Vegas hands down , no one comes close they fast friendly staff, food is always fresh never had no problem , very good place to go , new location on rainbow and trop, go there try it out u won't be disappointed i guaranteed u that , if so then u are use to that face chicken u get from Mac Donald's lol"}
{"text":"Finally a Chicken Shack on the West side. Known as the best local chicken restaurant in Green Valley! After eating here and tasting the quality you won't want to go to a Raising Cane's or Popeye's. Huge difference in freshness and taste!"}
{"text":"Holy moly!  Chicken wing lovers pay attention - this little counter in a Choice gas station/car wash had some of the best wings I have had in town so far.    Here I was chilling while I was waiting for my car to be washed, and I wanted a snack so I decided to give them a try.  The wings were breaded, and although I usually consider that a sin, these were so moist and juicy and cooked perfectly, it really didn't matter.  My husband, who wasn't hungry, nor is a huge fan of wings, ended up fighting over these with me.  I got the hot sauce, which wasn't massively overpowering hot, but was really flavorful.  They have about 8 other sauces to choose from, similar to Buffalo Wild Wings but much better.  I'm happy there's a wing joint I can enjoy so close to home.  Next time you have an urge for Buffalo Wild Wings, Wing Stop, Chicken Bonz, and especially Hooters down the street, consider this place instead."}
{"text":"I've been going to this specific location since 2009, when it was known as Chicken Bonz. It's my fav chicken strips/fingers in town, just above Cane's. Then they ended up with 3 Bonz named locations before rebooting with The Chicken Shack. Plus a crap load more locations opened up here and other states.. Glad my patronage helped pay for the expansion. Haha  The fingers are great. I always get the Garlic Parmesan flavor. Their ranch dressing is excellent. Their shoe-string fries are a little too greasy, but very tasty.  The service here is excellent. The dude that takes your order is always super friendly. Food comes out fresh and hot EVERY time.   My only 2 issues is they used to have ayce wings and ayce fingers. Both are long gone. Also they raised prices by about 2 bucks per combo.. but still worth what you pay."}
{"text":"These are think pieces of chicken heaven. Let's call em chicken thumbs, cuz chicken fingers are too thin compared to these..  Service: Always great. Dudes at front counter are always super nice and courteous, making you feel welcome.  Food: By far, my favorite chicken fingers in town, edging out Cane's because of the flavor selection here and available ranch dressing, which I prefer over Cane's sauce.   *New location opening on South Boulder soon! In the Albertson's parking lot*  My only gripe is no more ayce fingers and wings they used to have when they were once \"Chicken Bonz\" back in the day.."}
{"text":"I was craving chicken wings while in town and found the chicken shack on Yelp, boy, this place didn't disappoint. My party ordered a 25 piece of chicken wings with 5 different sauces and blue cheese. Every sauce was good, you can tell it was made from scratch. The chicken was crispy and not over sauced. The blue cheese was thick and creamy and was made from scratch. Everything was delicious. I am extremely pleased. This place definitely gives Buffalo Wild Wings a run for their money. The staff is very friendly as well."}
{"text":"Great chicken fingers and good service.  Good value for the money spent. Plenty of sauces to choose from."}
{"text":"Borrowing the words of the owner, this \"oasis\"  in Boulder City a total Gem. My hubby and I were so pleased to have stopped by, completely satisfied. I had the very fresh and juicy double shack burger and my hubby had the #2 chicken fingers. Deeeelish!!! Friendliest people here."}
{"text":"I was skeptical that Chicken Shack could really be a 5 star place, but with such great reviews we had to take our chicken-strip-loving son to try it out.  It was delish!!!  Moist chicken with a thin breading that was perfectly seasoned!  Shoestring fries were piled high and perfectly seasoned as well.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"On a road trip to the Hoover Dam saw this cute little Chicken Shack & decided to stop in and check this place out based on yelp. OH MY GOODNESS!!! Talk about home cooking yes sir!  It was flavorful & delicious the chicken fingers were all white breast meat & the skinny fries were so yummy cooked & salted to perfection this place is a hidden Gem   A kids meal more like a adult meal comes with 2 huge chicken fingers & a basket full of skinny fries with a small i think 16oz drink for the low price of $5.99 with unlimited refills what a bargain this place has plenty of parking space & this place is kept clean that you could eat off the tables you can it outside/inside your choice Oh yeah if you ask for the bathroom key which is attached to a rubber chicken how cute is that cluck cluck!  The restrooms are also kept up & very clean.  So if your looking for a home cooked meal that's served quick than stop by this place its well worth it trust me you will not be disappointed oh yeah they take cash & credit cards"}
{"text":"We stopped here on our way from Vegas to the Hoover Dam. What a awesome little place! The food was amazing and very reasonably price with a large portion! The staff was welcoming, friendly, and even gave us a few suggestions of sites to see while we were in town. Keep up the great work guys!"}
{"text":"I have gone to the Chicken Shack for years even when they were called Bones. I used to compare them to Canes, but they are different. I love the fingers. I've never had the wings because I'm more of a finger guy. Their sauces are great. I love their fries and their beans. The portions are generous. The staff is GREAT. If you like fingers, don't miss out."}
{"text":"Food is great I've been going there since freshman year of high school back in 2008. Today I had the worst customer experience of my life. I asked the cashier \"When you have a moment could you please come wipe out table down its kind of sticky\" the place was dead and he wasn't occupied but he never came. Ok I thought no worries. Our food was delivered to us by another gentlemen by the name of Daniel. I asked Daniel \"Could you wipe the table down for us when you get a chance\" he replied \"sure\". As he walked away with his back turned to he says \"a please would be appreciated \" in a completely passive aggressive tone. He's right I should have said please but that doesn't change the fact that he was being completely unprofessional. When he came back I proceeded to address the situation as he comment made me feel really uncomfortable. I told him hey I don't appreciate being spoken to In such an aggressive manner. He then proceeded to argue and escalate the situation in a completely immature way. Cherry on top when our argument concluded he followed it up with \"cool story bro\" that really got my blood boiling. I'm not one to complain but I felt the need to get a manager involved at this point. Their employee had disrespected me and was being completely unprofessional. When I spoke to them they mocked and asked me what they should do \"sit him down and give him a stern talking to\" with a huge grin on their face. They essentially blew me off and expect me to believe that will address the situation with the runner? Yea, I don't think so. It wasn't until another runner came out from the kitchen and acknowledged the situation and explained that Daniel can be a bit of a dick. It isn't my fault that's he's a dick or is having a bad day. They shouldn't take it out on their customer and if he can't deal with customers then he shouldn't be working in the customer service industry. I can honestly say that I will not be returning to chicken shack not after the complete disregard they showed for customer satisfaction."}
{"text":"I'm so excited they opened one on this side of town! Now I can come here all the time for lunch during the work week. Everyone is really nice here and the place is super clean!"}
{"text":"I love this location. They are super friendly, fast and the food is good. The owner is always here putting in work and coming around to the tables to make sure everyone is doing okay and enjoying their experience."}
{"text":"This is the best place to go in the Las Vegas valley for chicken. They keep it simple, don't have an enormous menu, but they do it right. Way better than the competition and I've tried them all. I just wish they had more locations."}
{"text":"Back for dinner tonight. This place rocks it. The chicken is fresh and good. The fries are unreal. They have about 15 different sauces. This place does it right. Food fresh, service fast. Still not the cleanest place. But, you have to realize they never stop frying chicken and fries.  Bound to be a challenge to keep clean."}
{"text":"I was told to go to this place multiple times and never made it around to going. The service was extremely fast by the time I got my drink and sat down the food was on my table. The food was very good as well. I got the Cajun chicken wings and side macaroni salad. It was extremely good and the people working there were very nice! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for good chicken!"}
{"text":"I don't write many reviews but when I do I write it about great service and awesome food like here at da shack. The food here is awesome the coating on the chicken is delicious and the fingers are perfectly moist inside the shoestring fries taste great and there is plenty of sauce options. They have draft beer and it is dirt cheap. Now for the service I have to say Eddie was one of the best employees at a restaurant that I have ever had service from he greeted me helped with the menu options was helpful and courteous the whole time five star service."}
{"text":"Came here first time from moving from Hawaii and gotta say that this place is top notch! It has a chill environment music and Farely quiet and feels like a good chill spot to eat delicious wings fries and BEER!"}
{"text":"We came the the chicken shack and Juan Pérez greater us while giving good service. We got the best chicken fingers and fries I've ever came across living in Vegas my whole life. The sauce selection of 20 was interesting to choose. Also I'd like to suggest mixing it up for an interesting  Experience.9"}
{"text":"Just happened to be on this side of town and it was about dinner time. I remembered this place from a couple years ago when I met up with a friend here. I liked their hole-in-the-wall location and atmosphere. It seems very little has changed since my last visit. Their place is located in an older strip mall. When I got there it was about 7:00 pm and the place was busy but not crowded. I ordered the five piece chicken strips along with the creamy parmesan and I believe it was the hot honey garlic sauce, both on the side. One side of sauce was enough, actually, to handle all five strips. Shoestring fries and fountain drink completed my order. The chicken strips I received were cooked to a darker golden brown (which made the outside more crunchy) but the chicken itself was tender and juicy, and hot off the fryer. I needed to wait a couple minutes by eating the fries first. The staff was friendly and helpful enough. Although *I* have had no issues, I would side with a few other reviewers and recommend coming during their peak hours. Yes, it will be busier but I also believe this is when they cook and serve their best food. I would be cautious of coming in close to closing time because orders may be cooked inconsistently."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Great wing and fingers.  They can get busy but that is because this place is that good."}
{"text":"This place is awesome...!  We were passing by to Las Vegas when we got hungry. We were initially suppose to go to jack in the box but we were feeling spontaneous to try local food. So we crossed they street and went to Chicken Shack. I ordered the #3 combo which was 3 chicken fingers, fries, and a drink. You choose what flavor you want on your chicken fingers which I chose the lemon pepper. Presentation was key with them the fingers were crispy, moist, and gold brown and the fries were hot and crispy! Sooo mouth-watering! My sister order the sweet chili sauce and that sauce was boommbb! Pretty much the place was amazing we truly  enjoyed our food and the experience. We will definitely stop by again if we decide to go Vegas again!!"}
{"text":"Love their chicken fingers but they need to really work on service. Each time I call to place order the order taker never repeats order and then they feel annoyed that you expect them to...Sorry but I too worked in fast food establishment and was taught to repeat order with customer. Sometimes they are not clear with their own menu. But good enough to go back."}
{"text":"Shopping next door at Smith's for some time, we had seen the signs for Chicken Shack for some time. One day, our preshopping hunger was going to cost us way too much money in the grocery store, so, we decided to give the Chicken Shack a try.  We both got the chicken finger and fries, with a fountain drink for both of us. Looking at the menu, if I was a fan of wings (too much work, not enough food) I could see myself diving into their AYCE wings. With such a wide selection of sauces available, you could eat your fill and still not have tried all of their sauces (maybe).  Our food came out pretty quickly, and tasted quite good. My main complaint is that the fryer oil appeared to be very old, as our fingers were dark and a bit tough. The high level of grease soaked into the batter was bordering on being too greasy.  That won't be our last visit, I hope to give them a shot, and see if we can time it to be near when they change the fryer oil."}
{"text":"This is an awesome little chicken wing/strip joint. The decorations are clever and cute. The food came out very fast. I order the 5 piece chick strip combo with medium sauce on the chicken and blue cheese dressing on the side with fries and a drink for $7.95. Love this place. Definately coming back!"}
{"text":"I ordered the hot wings tender strips came with some fries and a soda the fries was very greasy!! I don't no if I will be back"}
{"text":"The staff inside is really cool and down to earth. The flavor to the wings are nice but I recommend eating there or not driving to far . The chicken because it's breaded will become very soggy and a mess all over your fries. I made a stop so the food set for about 15 mins. I will try again maybe next time I will get regular chicken or eat there."}
{"text":"I've been the the chicken shack on sunset and had good experiences there. At this location they had my fingers out to me right after I paid for them. When I got them home we found them so tough and dry we were unable to eat them."}
{"text":"*Military Discount*  This was one of my favorite jokes when I was growing up:   Q. Why did the chicken cross the road? A. To show the possums how it's done.  I don't know why but it cracked me up every time.  It seems pretty dumb now LOL   Went on Friday 3-11-16 at noon for lunch.  This restaurant is located on Mountain Vista & Sunset in the Smith's shopping center.  The place was totally packed!!  Seems to be a popular spot for lunch.   It's kinda small inside but they do have some outdoor seating.    $16.51 got us a 6-wing basket with a drink and a chicken sandwich basket with a drink. It came out super fast!    Their chicken is crunchy on the outside although a bit bland but they have some tasty sauces for dipping to make up for that.  The wings were full of raw, yellow, fat which I HATE but not so much that I wouldn't eat them again.    Their fries are the skinny shoe-string type and were hot and crunchy.  Their soft drink machine must be calibrated perfectly because their mountain dew is pretty much the best I've ever had.   Overall a solid place to have lunch and not too hard on the wallet.  Their ranch is out-of-this-world AMAZEBALLS."}
{"text":"Been a fan of the shack ever since the one on Sunset. Found out that this location opened up near my house,  I knew I had to try it out.  Let me tell you,  I was not dissapointed. I love getting the mix combo with wings and fingers. My favorite is the Jerk sauce for the fingers and Lemon pepper seasoning with my wings.  The staff here was super friendly and the manager even came out to greet us and make sure everything was good.  Very good experience I had and will be definitely be stopping by more often thanks to the new location."}
{"text":"The wings are awesome. Nice big meaty breaded wings just like Hooters!!!"}
{"text":"This place is always busy. Every time I drive by it the place is full, so I decided to go there for dinner with my girlfriend. My experience there was \"ehhhh.\"  Girlfriend ordered the fried chicken with fries. I got their triple patty burger and fries. We both got drinks with the meal.   First off, the Dr. Pepper machine was not working. Strike 1.   The guy taking my order asked how I wanted my burger cooked, I said medium rare. It came out well done and dryer than moses' nose in the desert. Strike 2.   There was no strike 3 from myself, but girlfriend did not like the chicken and was less than pleased with the meal. She said the chicken was dry and flavorless. With a simple meal like fried chicken, I imagine its hard to screw that up but it happened.   Perhaps I'll give them another chance in the future and maybe we caught them on a bad night. If that's the case, I'll update the review at a later date."}
{"text":"I love this place, always a friendly hello. Chicken is better than KFC and Kane's!!! Dipping sauces are wonderful, so many to chose from. My favorite is the garlic."}
{"text":"This place was a good little eatery that offered a variety of items from chicken fingers, chicken wings, burgers, chili, etc. Of course we came to try to chicken fingers since that's what all the hype was about. Tried it slathered in hot sauce, which was good flavor... but seemed to be just like Frank's Red Hot sauce just not as spicy. The chicken was  dry, but still okay covered in sauce. I was pleased to have shoestring fries! They also offer a variety of other sauces either on the side or on your chicken. Next time I think we'll opt for on the side. Of course they offer the usual fixings of ranch, blue cheese, etc for dipping as well. This place can get busy though! We beat the crowd, but shortly after many people were looking for  table to sit at. Decent place to check out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Awesome place for chicken, definitely recommended to all chicken lovers. Ordered #4 combo which comes with drink and fries. The fries are awesome."}
{"text":"I use to work near by so if I was getting lunch this was usually the 2nd place I would pick. When I would go I usually got the 3 piece finger meal, believe me it's enough to make you full without being over stuffed.   It comes with 3 large sized chicken fingers, shoestring fries, a sauce, and drink.    I don't know what seasoning they put on the  fries but the are the most scrumptious fries I've ever had, and I hate shoestring fries.   I always get the sauce on the side. I get the honey mustard sauce, which costs a bit more but I don't mind because its like crack!  I'm really not a fan of their buffalo sauces something is off putting about them.  What I love most is that it's quick, tasty, real chicken fingers, AND they have sweet tea (that alone pulls at my southern girl heart strings)"}
{"text":"Great service, wings crispy  but bland, tenders nothing like the well known food chain in Vegas, but very big. Customer service was great, food came fast. Free refills,  wish I had gotten all wings instead of tenders. .wouldn't go back but it was ok"}
{"text":"Everytime I drive by here, there are people. Roberto's next door might be empty,  but the Chicken Shack has people there.....why? What is it about this place?  Well, finally decided to go in an check it out on a Monday night around 8pm. A couple TV's with some sports on. They serve beer. OK, I'm beginning to understand the appeal. Wings, chicken strips, burgers, chicken sandwiches, fries, and a few other sides. Simple menu.  I got a 12 wing pack, creamy garlic parmesan and Damn Hot! split. $11.99 or a dollar a wing. Wings are big, so decent enough pricing. At a glance I thought the sides prices were a bit high, but I didn't see the quantity served.   I wasn't overwhelmed with the creamy garlic parmesan wings, I have had better at dive bars. Not bad, just not great. My friend said the Damn Hot! wings weren't that hot. I didn't try them so no comment.  Its an ok place, mostly frequented by younger people. I'll probably stop by again sometime but I wouldn't go out of my way. Usually I bbq my own wings. 3 stars fits the bill."}
{"text":"I don't entirely know why, but I'm kind of obsessed with Chicken Shack. I'm rarely on that side of town, but have noticed it on my way to Ross J's. It looked kinda ghetto so I stayed away till a couple weeks ago when Ross J's was closed early. I'm glad I tried it because I'm a little addicted now.  I'm probably kind of biased because their plain wings taste just like when my mom makes korean chicken before she dips it in the sauce. Nostalgia is a funny thing, but I do think they're also just really good wings.   Price is about $1/wing and many have mentioned that's overpriced, but that seems standard to me for restaurants - BWW is about the same. Chicken Shack also has huge drummies and wings, not broken or midget ones like a lot of other places. I'm a fatty, but I was full off of 6 wings because they're bigger and meatier.   For sides, we've tried the cole slaw, baked beans, and fries - only the fries were really good crispy shoestrings, I'd pass on the rest and just stick with wings. For sauce my fav is the habanero honey (not that spicy) and garlic parm. The bbq and sweet chili were pretty standard, but I also liked the wings just plain because they had seasoning already.   Service was great and the tables were clean the 2 times that I've been, with guys coming out to wipe down tables as soon as they're free. I hate nickel and diming - they charge for ranch/blue cheese and extra sauce, but what can you do.  I also agree with others who've said that their chicken fingers are dry - stick with the wings."}
{"text":"Their fries and chicken tenders are nice and crispy. The fries are thin and the chicken tenders are a good size, not too big and not too small.   They have a variety of sauces, I tried a few and those were good."}
{"text":"I am so glad this place opened up and it's close to my home.  Customer service is amazing(there's a real cool vibe), food was cooked up and ready to go before I could sit down to wait on it.  I will def be back for more and would recommend anyone to swing by for some great chicken and fries.  I'm super excited to try their chilli cheese fries next!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed Chicken Shack so much my second trip was only three days after my first! They have a sauce for everyone (try the jerk) & wings are the size they're SUPPOSED to be (big)!! They even have salad & burgers if wings aren't your thing.  They offer a really good ayce deal I'm not prepared to take advantage of...  yet.  Located in the same shopping center as Ross J's Aloha Grill  & a Roberto's this is a delicious food run adventure waiting to happen!"}
{"text":"Chicken Shack is the best! We've been eating here for years. Eddie helped us and was very polite, accommodating and friendly. Glad to see them opening new locations but  still keeping up customer service at   all of the older locations."}
{"text":"OMG  I can't get enough of this place. Forget Popeye's, forget Wing Stop... Chicken Shack is where it's at. From the Wings to STRIPS TO THE CHICKEN SALAD!! YUMMY I been there 3 visits and will be a regular as my Man and I work wacky schedules and don't always cook.  The fries are light,fresh and tasty and salads are fresh! Everything is made to order, even when you call in, you'll get HOT food at pick up. Amazing job Valle Verde Team!! Staff super nice, professional clean and ready."}
{"text":"Yes yes yes! Amazing! They seriously have the BEST chicken fingers I e ever had! The fries are great as well. They have a ton of different sauces and rubs to choose from, I've had a few of them and they have all been really good! Not to mention the customer service is incredible! The employees are so helpful and friendly! Keep up the great work chicken shack!"}
{"text":"They are friendly and the food is always amazing. This is by far the best chicken shack I've been too!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Love the HUGE selection of dipping sauces. The fry sauce is great and the habanero honey has just the perfect kick. The fries are thin cut which is my personal favorite! Definitely recommend it over other chain fast food places on your way to Vegas or wherever!"}
{"text":"Amazing chicken! Our favorite spot for chicken literially every Sunday after church! We bring everyone there! But recently the customer service hasn't been very pleasant. The 2 new cashiers that we encountered the past 2 months have been very rude & aggrivated with their job. The back of the house guys are always good to us and personable. We recently missed a Sunday there bc of their service. We hope that it'll change soon or they will lose us."}
{"text":"Great place. Friendly staff and great food. Multiple sauces that are really good. If they tell you the sauce is hot. They mean it. But all in all a great place to eat."}
{"text":"People don't waste your money we bought the $40 dollar order when we got it home the chicken and the fries were over cooked and the fries were so hard over crisped that you couldn't chew them I called and they were not very interested in what I had to say I asked for manager sounded like a young guy don't waste your money go to the one on sunset road very disappointed a waste of $40 and threw most of it out"}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way to grand canyon staff was great and the food wad fresh and not overly priced like everything else in vegas, i ate the wings and my wife ate the strips both were good"}
{"text":"I looove their fries! I'm a shoestring fry kinda girl. I got the garlic parmesan wings and they were pretty good. Not much to complain about.. good price, good food. Just the woman working the counter seemed a little bit too busy and didn't provide such great customer service. Everything else was good!"}
{"text":"Or ma gerd, this place is good!  Fresh, never frozen white meat chicken fingers.  Huge/tasty.  Their chili is great too. I've had their wings and fries and a burger once but the fingers are what it's all about for me.  I get the honey mustard and medium wing sauce.  The place is clean and always a few customers in there.  Someone told me it is under new management.  Good enough.  As long as they manage to keep making those fingers, I'll manage to buy them on my way home from work.  Oh, and its fast service!   I met the owner - they are very hands on and always there. You can tell."}
{"text":"So good!!  The chicken is incredibly moist. The only criticism I have is when I ordered, the gentleman asked what type of sauce would I like with the chicken. I requested blue cheese, but was surprised that he charged me for it. I got a 10 pack - I thought sauce would come with it. Had I known it was not included, I would have used my own blue cheese at home (to go order)."}
{"text":"My husband really likes Chicken Shack in comparison to Raising Cane's.  The quality, the taste, the size of the tenders are no comparison.   They are usually quick and it takes little to no time to whip up those tenders.  The girls behind the counters are super sweet, helpful and patient when I'm picking out the sauces.    The chef is really nice and we get an extra tender or two because I always order the 20 pack, so we can some leftovers for a snack.  Sounds like a lot for 2 people, but those suckers goes fast with heavy eaters like us.    If you're a lightweight, like me with hot sauce then don't mess with their habanero mixes- they will burn your mouth for HOURS.  The Yelp check-in discount helps me tip more =)"}
{"text":"I always love coming here because the food is so awesome. Today I had an extra special experience. Eddie was the cashier and he is great. He has such a fun and positive attitude. We all know no one likes to work but he seemed to be genuinely happy to be there & it made me want to come back. Way to go Chicken Shack and way to go Eddie!!"}
{"text":"Great service and nothing beats an air conditioned quaint place.   The bf and I had a \"half & half\" of 3 wings and 3 fingers with shoestring fries.  Tried : Honey bbq, hot teriyaki, garlic parmesean, and lemon pepper. Gotta say the lemon pepper was my favorite since there was this kick to it at the end.   Ended up eating just one of each because we were curing a hangover...  Their sweet tea is excellent!   Brought it home for dinner and dipped it into spinach dip which was surprisingly good.   Will definitely go back again"}
{"text":"Had stop in for the amazing sauce(s) and homemade chili.   Tried a few new sauces today. All where yummy and delicious."}
{"text":"Makes raising canes on lake mead and i95 on the run.  Then again it is good place to go since I work at SandHill and Patrick."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to order lunch at the office. Prices are good, food is always fresh, hot and delicious, and the staff is very friendly. The shack salad is second to none, I could eat it every day.  My kids love it too! Thanks for the great service and great food!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It's a small shack with air conditioning. Thank God! My boyfriend and I stopped by here after tour Hoover Dam and we were damn hungry. I found this place on yelp and decided to give it a try. I even convinced the boyfriend. I got the meal option with 3 chicken tenders with cajun sauce, fries, and a drink. They gave me four tenders!! Whoo!! They were crispy and crunchy even when doused in sauce.   My boyfriend had 12 wings with lemon pepper and creamy garlic parmesan. Those wings were crispy too!!! I hate when my wings just are sauced up with no flavor on the meat.  Their wings are full of flavor inside and out. I would definitely come here again. Also, their fries are sooooo good."}
{"text":"The name Chicken Shack accurately describes what this place is. The facility is extremely small and can barely hold the amount of customers coming in and out. It is super cramped and during lunch time, say goodbye to personal space. It's quite the struggle trying to maneuver yourself around the place.   Fortunately, the food here is delicious. The chicken fingers are some of the best in town, not because they're the highest of quality, but rather they're cooked just like southern chicken fingers. If you can get your mind away from how uncomfortable the facility is, you'll definitely appreciate what Chicken Shack has to offer."}
{"text":"Chicken Shack is under new ownership. YES! Well there goes my waist line. Lol Today I had a little bit of everything. Chili was amazing! You can totally tell that it's \"homemade\" everything about it screamed give me more. There's this great kick to it that makes it stand out for sure. The breaded strips were cooked to perfection. I'm a ranch dressing type of girl but there's plenty of specialty sauces to indulge in. The fries were, ahhh perfecto!  They have  revamped the shack and I'm down for the cause!  5 stars guys. Amazing turn around I really wish I had the strength not to return but crap I don't! Hahahah"}
{"text":"Best wings in town! They are crispy and still moist with a great sauce selection. The menu is extremely limited, but you really only go for one or two things. The inside doesn't have much in the way of atmosphere so I'd recommend ordering to go. The only downside of this place is if visiting right before they close, they run out of some options and it just never tastes as good - the rest of the day is spot on."}
{"text":"I was at Kohl's and saw that Chicken Shack was now open in their new location. Of course I had to stop in and check them out! There was no one line when we arrived so I had to time to browse the menu.   I decided on the #1 combo: 6 wings, fries and a drink. I ordered the garlic parmesan as they are my favorite. The Pepsi fountain drinks were limited, with two of the eight choices not used. A short time later I noticed our order sitting waiting to be delivered. No one brought them out so we walked up to get them ourselves.   The garlic parm wings were regular wings with a wet garlic sauce on top. Ive never had them served like this before anywhere, they are always coated in garlic and parmesan and then fried. I did not care for them served like this at all, I hate \"wet\" wings.   The actual wings themselves were large and juicy, cooked perfectly. The fries were shoestring style and also good. Being a new business you would think someone would come by and check on you, but no one did. This is try #3 for this location with East Coast eats and Buddha belly both going under. I will give them another try but will have to make sure they are served dry!"}
{"text":"Ordered the #1 and while the wings were cooked well and the fries were crisp (love them this way), their food is ruined by whoever is responsible for salting the food because my food was overly salted. I couldn't finish my food because all I can taste is salt. I hope next time, if here is a next time, the food won't be overly salty."}
{"text":"Why'd the chicken cross the road? To go to Chicken Shack...duh! ha ha  I've been to Chicken Shack a few times now, and it's been consistently good. For about $6.00, you can get fries, 3 chicken strips, and a soda - Combination #3 on the menu...they also have beer (on tap) for around a $1.00, but the selection is limited. Both times I've been, the place has been packed with people. It's a small space, but I've always been able to snag a table. I like when a restaurant has some personality, and this place is anything but boring! The staff is friendly, the patrons are lively, and the walls are covered in funny phrases that reference chickens...on top of that, the service is usually pretty quick.  Okay, now for the food. The star here is the chicken. It's crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside...it's surprising that with no bone they are able to keep the chicken so tender and juicy, but somehow they manage to do it. I should mention, too, that these are NOT little chicken strips...they are plump pieces of all white meat (their chicken is the antithesis to McDonald's ha ha). Every time, my friend thinks that he needs the 5 piece, and although he finishes them, he always says it was too much food! Everyone is different, but the 3 piece combo has always been plenty for me. I get the Habanero Honey BBQ sauce on the side, and also order a side of blue cheese. One of my pet peeves at restaurants is when they nickle and dime you, and here the blue cheese/ranch/extra sauce is an extra $0.49/$0.35...I'd rather them just factor that cost into my food. The fries are good, but after eating my chicken, I find that it is salt overload...  The reason I come here is for the chicken. They execute it well, and they're consistent. If you're craving some fried chicken, skip KFC and check this place out!"}
{"text":"There wings were ok. They just threw the rub on the wings ( more on plate then wings) the thin fries are good! The fingers weren't amazing. I've had better from carnes. They also just sprayed lightly  the fingers in sauces I could of did that's myself and better.  Best option order plain and dip urself in sauce.."}
{"text":"I'm in Boulder a couple times a month and usually eat at a different local dive. But, I've seen this place and the reviews and wanted to try it.  The woman that helped me was super nice and it's a nice, and seemingly cozy place to eat.  The three stars are because my chicken was leathery and chewy which was really unfortunate and may keep me from returning. I would have asked for a redo if I wasn't already on my way back across town. Also, as a first timer I didn't know the sauce situation. They give you a \"house\" sauce even if you don't want it and then charge you $.49 for others. Not a fan of that policy.  There's a lot of good reviews so I wouldn't say don't try it... I just hope your chicken is a lot fresher than mine. I've never been let down by my normal place in Boulder (TPS)."}
{"text":"You don't have to have a lot of money to enjoy some really good chicken here it's a great place for nice relaxed atmosphere with your family I also got brave enough to try the hamburger for the first time and it is really top-notch I was definitely surprised considering it's a chicken place"}
{"text":"Very delicious chicken, we got the chicken sandwich, grilled salad, and the big combo. The wings were more flavorful and popular with my family than the fingers. Sweet tea was great aswell. Would come again if stopping in the area!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Chicken Shack for 2 years and I love it. The chicken is so fresh and delicious. The workers are always kind. Go to Chicken Shack, it'll change your life"}
{"text":"This is a revision of my previous review, which was done several months earlier on the 2nd day of their opening.  They definitely had their glitches on the 2nd day, but things have improved quite a bit!  The service is fast and EXTREMELY friendly.  The food is pretty good for the fast food category.  Definitely worth a stop if you're heading down Nevada Highway."}
