{"text":"I'm not a student, I met someone for lunch here today and the Hub is a pretty good place to eat. I had the BBC Burger, it is the bacon cheddar burger but with BBQ sauce and the same price as the bacon cheddar burger, it was really good and the fries were great as well.The service was pretty good as well, our server was very friendly.  The ambiance was pretty good as well. The Hub seemed to be a very clean place. I'm not sure what the bathrooms were like for those of you who would like to know.  I would recommend the Hub to anyone, try it out for yourselves."}
{"text":"Very hit and miss. Some days the food and service is amazing,  others it leaves much to be desired. They have a full complement of booze and a fairly reasonable menu. Students tend to think it's a bit pricey but I average 10-15 bucks on food."}
{"text":"I have never had such a miserable restaurant experience. Keep in mind only half of the tables were full. It took us 50min to get our food and even then it was because I told them I had too leave with or without the food. At 35 min I told them we would need to take the food to go as we had to leave soon. After all that when I finally sat down to eat my meal in class they had gotten it wrong. I told the waitress I do not eat pork and wanted just onions and instead she gave me bacon no onions. The waitresses were nice and seemed completely stressed out, I can only assume they were understaffed"}
