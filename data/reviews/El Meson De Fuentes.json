{"text":"My family and I decided on this restaurant last Friday. Mostly because it was Friday and every other restaurant was super crowded. I don't know why i thought we should stop at the Mexican restaurant with the empty parking lot.      When we pulled in an employee walked out, my husband and i figured she was coming to tell us the restaurant was closed, but she was just taking a smoke break.. i mean lollipop break. it looked like a cig but my hubs told me it was a sucker...she just stared at us and didnt say anything so we assumed it was open and walked in.      the waitress who seated us was very nice.. the atmosphere seemed like a family restaurant. the chips and salsa were decent..i ordered the chicken and beef burritos with the side of rice and a strawberry Margarita .. when my drink came out it was huge but it was obviously a mix and it wasnt very cold so i could barely drink it.. my chicken burrito was okay..  the beef burrito was much worse than any taco meat that I've ever made at home.. much worse.. the rice was okay but then i noticed what seemed to be canned peas and carrots mixed in.. my husband got the enchiladas with mole sauce with steak on the side and rice.. he ate his. but said he would much rather spend less money and go to chipotle.. the steak was also just okay..        so we left the restaurant and i felt nauseous for the rest of the night.. this was the worst Mexican food that I've ever eaten.  its too bad because our server was so nice and i really wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"This is not just one of the worst Mexican restaurants I have ever eaten in, it is one of the worst restaurants I have ever eaten in. It doesn't have a liquor license, even though it has margaritas on the menu. I had shredded beef tacos and couldn't even finish them. We left as soon as we could to find something different. We were the only people in the restaurant, which should have tipped us off."}
{"text":"Yikes. DO NOT look in the kitchen. This place is disgusting. Something about this place just makes you feel dirty. The food is gross. Tried this place for .99 cent margaritas, Which were good. But I would never order any food from their menu. The outdoor patio would be awesome if they turned the tv's on. Order your drinks in bulk because you probably won't see your waitress for the rest of the night! Don't go here"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here and we both got terrible food poisoning. The margaritas were not good at all either. The place looks nice from the outside,but the food just did not taste good whatsoever. The service however was wonderful, but we will never go there again or recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"My friend and I tried this restaurant based off of a food critics recommendation from the News Herald. This man should be fired and forced to eat this food everyday as punishment until his final days. Not sure how this place is getting good reviews but i just attribute it to the lack of good Mexican food in the area people and have just lowered their expectations. The food was gross probably equivalent to Jalapeno Loco...i couldn't eat it...and i weigh 315 pounds.....so anytime a fat guy doesn't finish his plate we got a problem. The kicker was, we waited forever for our check so i had to hunt the waitress down and she brought my bill but never handed it to me. I caught a glimpse of the total was $30 and handed her my card. She brought me back the receipt without the check and rang me up for $32.  i asked why the discrepancy and she became frazzled. I considered it a tip and walked out. Listen, $2 isn't a lot of money and she was probably just trying to scrape some cash together for a decent meal so god bless her...it's just the point. Save yourself folks!! Get Taco Bell or let's start a grass roots to bring back Chi'Chis!! Adios!"}
{"text":"We love this place.  We have gone the past few weeks to take advantage of the specials they have on fajitas and margaritas on Wednesday nights.  The fajitas have a delicious flavor, and are served with all the usual fixings.  The special is on either chicken, steak, or mixed fajitas.  We always go with the mix.  The atmosphere is cozy, does not at all feel like some big chain place.  That's one of the things I like about it here, makes it more comfortable, more like a neighborhood restaurant than a chain restaurant plopped down somewhere.    The service is super fast, and the waitress recoginzed us (on only our second time there) and brought a sample strawberry margarita for us to try since she saw how much we were enjoying the lime one on the rocks with salt.  The side fixings are very flavorful refried beans, a good amount of rice, and of course lettuce, guacamole, pico de gallo and cheese.  Their guacamole is very good.    I love that I already feel like a regular there and the wait staff is friendly and very attentive.    Fajitas are served sizzling hot and margaritas are cool and thrist quenching.  Definitely give this a try!"}
{"text":"Oh my.   Please close this place.  Went there for .99 cent margaritas.  Left with food poisoning.  Remember the scene from bridesmaids?... The place is a mess...it looks just like the old bar Hobnobbers.  Can see right into the kitchen (mistake to look).  Margaritas were all mix.  I had the #32 chicken and beef burrito.  It was sitting in a pool of some sort of fluid.  I ate some rice and picked thruough the burrito... Waiter was busy...service was slow, food was awful.    Then came 0130 hrs..... I had barf in my mouth...and explosive diahrreah.  For the love of pete...listen to me.  Avoid like the plague."}
{"text":"This new Mexican restaurant just opened recently in Mentor.  My wife and I tried it last night.  Overall, I would say it was very good and would definitely go back.  We just had chips and salsa to start.  The chips were good, pretty standard corn chips, but the salsa was very good, about medium spicy and with significant garlic.  My wife had what they called Tostados Cerviche.  But she said it was not really like the traditional pickled seafood cerviche.  One of the toastados had shrimp, the other some type of spicy fish.  She said they were good, everything was very fresh and the portions nice, but not exactly what she was hoping for.  I had the Pollo con Rajas (or something like that).  It was a grilled boneless, pounded flat, chicken breast, covered with lovely roasted poblano peppers and cheese and served with grilled onions and green peppers in a fajitas style, along with a side of rice and refried beans, and a Guacamole salad.  The roasted poblanos were great, roasted till they had almost a creamy texture, and really made the dish.  It was excellent.  They don't have their liquor license yet (reportedly coming soon) so we just had water, but we got out of there under $25 for the two of us.  I will absolutely go back."}
{"text":"Not the worst Mexican restaurant in the area, but far from the best. Really, try someplace else. There's nothing here that stands out."}
