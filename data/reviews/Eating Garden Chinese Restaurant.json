{"text":"On the plus side, the food was piping hot and the service was quick.   Quite simply, this was one of the most tasteless meals of my life.  I had to salt my food and put some of the hot peppers from the jar on my food to get some flavour.    Hot and sour soup:  It was very bland and not spicy at all, although it did have a few shrimp.  Even the Mandarin, now when you go to a Chinese buffet, many of the items are compromised, their hot and sour soup was much better.    Sea bass: boring  Noodle dish:  boring  Sichuan chicken:  also boring.  Now, you would think that anything Sichuan would be hot and spicy.  This was not.    As another person on restaurantica put it perfectly, \"Overall though the dishes lacked a bit of flavour punch, as we found every dish to be somewhat bland overall in flavour.\""}
{"text":"Well, we love Eating Garden . We generally order double lobster special in onion ginger sauce and they make it fresh from their tanks. We order  a mixed vegetable dish and veggies are crisp, fresh and delicious. Our frequent trips to Toronto wouldn't be complete without a lobster dinner at Eating Garden."}
{"text":"I was so close to giving this place 1 star. Luckily I was able to eat most of the leftovers rather than throwing them all out once I applied enough hot sauce, so it couldn't be \"1 star bad\", but this place is still one of the worst meals I've had in some time.  We ordered delivery after finding this place as a recent addition to Just-Eat.ca which I like for the convenience of having food show up at my door without having to even pick up a phone.  Our order consisted of: vegetarian spring rolls crispy deep fried wontons deep fried chicken wings General Tao chicken w/ steamed rice stir fried vermicelli w/ shrimp, pork, and curry.  It seemed like everything was cooked in the same deep fryer. The problem being, that deep fryer also cooked fish at some point. Seriously, everything except the vermicelli dish (which was dry and bland) had a similar after taste with a slight fishyness to it.  I can't even say \"at least the delivery was fast\".  This place is a fail. Complete and utter fail."}
