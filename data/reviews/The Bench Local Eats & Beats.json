{"text":"If you can't cook food. Service is very poor. If you can not get it together. Stop digging a hole. The eggs were over hard. Bacon was deep fried dripping in grease and with Tatar tots. Not the potatoes. Marinara sauce was green. That's not Marinara."}
{"text":"New bar, same horrible service. This place is the old Lucky Break and we decided to give this place one more chance since it is under new management. They couldn't have hired worse bartenders/servers. The bartender, Alicia, never came and spoke to me and ask what I wanted to eat or drink. We had to wave her down from talking to all the various men at the bar. I ordered a half Baja salad; it was on a tiny dinner plate and was $7. $7 should be the size of a full salad. Not to mention it was drenched in dressing after I ordered it with dressing on the side. Unfortunately I was never able to tell Alicia this because she never came back to me to ask how it was. On top of all this, the manager refused to change the channel to a certain game. It is a real shame this bar can never get their act together because there are so many neighbors who can walk here and give them business."}
{"text":"Friday night with the Gouveia sisters is where it's at! I came here to watch them perform and had a great time! The food was good and the music was poppin, we paid a $5 cover and stayed until midnight. This place is great for a get-together and I will definitely be coming back again! They also have pool tables!"}
