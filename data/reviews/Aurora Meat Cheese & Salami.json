{"text":"Fresh meats and cheese and high quality. I Remember coming here as a child with my parents or Nonna and always loved it although it is a lot bigger now. Friendly staff here aswell and the food they sell is pretty good"}
{"text":"We have been shopping there for years and we live in downtown Toronto. The service is impeccable and the beef and the free range turkey is amazing. Thank you Tom especially for making our dinners successful.  Kemeel and Madge"}
{"text":"Highest quality meats  If you love meat this is the place. This is the best of the best. Family owned for over 52 years.."}
{"text":"How do they manage to make bland Italian food? The pizza is dry, flavourless and overpriced. The sandwiches are similar with overly salty meats and ketchup-like tomato sauce. At 5.95 a sandwich it's better that you get a subway footlong, fresher and tastier. Disappointingly mediocre."}
{"text":"Shopped there on June 16, 2010.  Very clean. They have all sorts of authentic Italian products. I was in there to grab some dinner from their deli. I had their Zesty Fried Eggplant Sandwich and a Brio cola. Would definately go back for lunch some time."}
{"text":"Great family owned shop.  Super friendly and amazing quality meats."}
{"text":"Excellent butcher! Fresh meat and a not so cheap price, but totally worth it for great meals!"}
{"text":"I like Aurora Meats, but one day recently I asked one of butchers there whether they had Kosher meat and was told 'yes', that their meats were Kosher.  Later, giving it a little thought and looking at their website (which doesn't mention this) I decided that it was unlikely.  I hope they will clarify this.  What-ever the certification I think it is important to be clear and accurate about it."}
{"text":"Fresh selection of meats, deli and cheese - but I find things to pricey here! With so much other choices, I'd much rather go to Starsky's which is just 5-10 min drive away."}
