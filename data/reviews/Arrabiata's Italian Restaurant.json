{"text":"The restaurant is quite small and seating is limited. We were there on a  Saturday evening and we had no problem being seated immediately. I'm assuming our waiter was new. If he wasn't he should consider a new occupation. Aside from giving us the wrong bill, we were never offered a 2nd cup of coffee, had to wait forever for the meal, for the the bill, then the correct bill, the change from the bill and of course he never asked how everything was.  Now that we've gone through the negative stuff let me say the food was really quite good. I ordered chicken marsala. It came with a side of spaghetti and I should say the sauce was really quite good along with the rest of the meal. My partner ordered a vegetable and pasta dish which was also very good. Needless to say we always do the taste test on each others meal. I would recommend the restaurant. The food was excellent. The prIce was reasonable, the portions were more then adequate and I'm sure that by now our waiter is either working somewhere else or he knows what to do."}
{"text":"I have no idea why I disliked the food so much, but it was honestly the worst eggplant parmesan I've had in my life. The eggplant is thin and tender (unbreaded, which is the way I make it at home) but with very little sauce and overall very bland aside from garlic. The bread was fine, but the salad was pretty boring, and the pasta we had wasn't much better. I know a lot of people who love this restaurant, and maybe we simply caught them on an off night, or didn't have one of their specialties, but no one in our group enjoyed their meal."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place for 4 or 5 years now and it always seems to be crowded just based on the number of cars in the parking lot.  We went last night and were really pleased with the experience.  Waitress was friendly and attentive but would leave right away.  Did not get that sense of schmoozing for tip at all which I hate, so she got a good one in the end.  We had the hot antipasto for two which was absolutely superb.  The best of that plate though was the clams casino which was really a great mix of herbs and tastes.  I had a veal entree (cacciatore) which was excellent.  My wife and Linguine Alfredo which was also excellent.  My son and lasagna with meatballs.    A couple other reviews mentioned it but they have have a big menu so it took us quite a while to figure out what we wanted.  Similarly the dining room is loud.  Couple of folks suggested that the dining room was \"small\".  Not sure what they mean given the location.  We went on  a Saturday night and go right in - to one of maybe two open tables."}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times and there are always lots of people eating here so keep that in mind because maybe it's just me that's not impressed. The staff is fine, the decor is a slightly strange mix of industrial and Tuscan but that's fine.   The real problem for me is the food. I've never been to an Italian restaurant that is so obsessed with fried food. Even though the menu doesn't specify, almost every entree I've had has been battered and fried; the only difference is they throw a sauce and a few vegetables on it. Also (or maybe because of this), it's really salty. Salads are just so-so. Not a lot of fresh ingredients here."}
{"text":"Surprised the avg. rating for this restaurant isn't higher. Very solid and consistently good/great food along with a menu that will please even the pickiest of diners."}
{"text":"Outstanding! I've lived in CA for 17 years and love seafood so we decided to check this place out since it is pretty close. We ate late, but were surprised at how few people were in the place when we got there. I was glad it wasn't too busy though because it was our anniversary so we were looking for something less busy. We both got Oysters, which was an appetizer special. Have to admit they were delicious. Wasn't expecting that being so far away from the ocean. I also ordered the Halibut special. I haven't had halibut that good ever! It was amazing! The dinner came with a salad and bread with this delicious garlic butter. Even the Italian salad dressing was great. They have a wonderful wine list and martinis. I got a nice Coppola Sauvignon Blanc. I also noticed they had Cakebread SB by the bottle. Next time I might have to go with that. I honestly can't believe there were so few people there, it was fantastic. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very good Italian food. Bread is fresh baked and salads were crisp. The house italian dressing is very good as is their veal dishes. Service is always good and the restaurant was clean. We eat here often and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"There are lots of Italian restaurants in the Cleveland Metropolitan area.  Not so where we live in NC, so each trip home demands exploring this cuisine which we can't get down south.  Arrabiata's is--hands down--the best Italian restaurant we have discovered on the East Side.  The dining room is small and noisy, it's true.  I'm sure there are many times you might have to wait for a table.  We dropped in at 6:30 on a Wednesday night, and were seated right away.  Although the joint was jumping, service was quick and attentive, and our server was friendly and professional.  The house salad had a great creamy Italian dressing. Two in our party had entrees with marsala sauce, which was wonderful, and all three dinners came with a side of pasta with marinara sauce, which had a wonderful home cooked depth of flavor.  This restaurant has been around for a long time, and there is a reason."}
{"text":"Was surprised to see the low ratings. This is one of my favorite restaurants. Great selection, food and service. Great place."}
{"text":"Serving yesterday's bread for lunch. Made a classic mistake, we were not ready for our server who only gave us 1 minute to look at the menu, then we had to wait too long for the server to return. Average food, pleasant but less than perfect service."}
{"text":"Don't believe the 4 & 5 start reviews! They fooled me and after eating herewith my daughter, we both surmised that the good reviews must come from staff, loyal customers,  or people that have only ever eaten Italian food from a jar, or Olive Garden (which is basically the same thing). The service was great, but the food was terrible.   The \"special\" lobster bisque tasted like tomato soup with a fishy additive,  it was bright orange just like tomato, not a creamy bisque at all! The pre dinner salad was bleh & My eggplant parmesan was really bland, the sauce was bottled, or canned marina.  My daughter picked at her chicken dish and was not impressed at all.  The worst part was the bill, and having to pay 40 for an absolutely terrible dinner. Don't be fooled by the reviews. This restaurant is cute on the inside, the staff was great, and maybe it was a good place to eat at some point in the past."}
{"text":"A bit disappointed, no Happy Hour, no ambiance and food quality is fair!! The wedding soup had no flavor and substance.  Piccalos soup, food Happy Hour and ambiance is Hands down much, much better!!!!"}
{"text":"I try to stop in here every time I am in the area. Fantastic Carbonara sauce. The menu says over linguine, but they will put it over any pasta you ask for. I like it best on the fettuccine.  Great veal dishes. The veal Sinatra is unique and my favorite."}
{"text":"You're probably the only other table in the place which I'm assuming it's from Cavs game tonight comma but the whole experience left me a little wanting more. Everything was just not quite great .  We ordered drinks  when we got there  I had a glass of zinfandel which was good , but my friend ordered a Ketel One vodka martini  which is his regular drink and he said it didn't taste like kettle one. We both ordered egg plant parmesan  which came with side salads  and bread . The salads were just basic greens with a little bit of pasta salad on top and two black olives from a can. Then we got our friend which was similarly okay, it was warm and soft in the middle and came with garlic butter. Kmart main course. It was a good size plate of breaded eggplant with red marinara sauce and mozzarella cheese but for all the amount of the eggplant on the plate there's only mozzarella cheese on top of the first layer what you left you wanting more for the rest of the dish. It was also a little bit underseasoned and had a little bit of flour taste to it. It came with a small side of linguine with marinara sauce. Get it was okay, but not great. We also witnessed one of the employees emptying out the trash in the bathroom and then picking up silverware off of the tables which was kind of gross since he handed us our silverware earlier."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Italian restaurants in the area. Always great food, good portions and reasonably priced. Try the pasta derosa it's a red/white mixed sauce. However, if you like calamari I don't suggest ordering it here."}
{"text":"Prepare for a long, long wait. Nearly 15 minutes passed after we were seated and still, no one approached our table - not even for a drink order. The restaurant was not terribly busy and there were plenty of staff. Too bad most were chatting among themselves behind the bar.   The food was below average and not just because it was served cold. The crab stuffed salmon was bland, the \"crab stuffing\" on top tasted like nothing more than Stove-Top. I actually sent it back and because of how long things took, I simply ate my side of pasta. My date ordered the chicken Oscar, which had a bit more flavor but needed to go back to the kitchen as it was served lukewarm.    While we were waiting for her chicken, another waitress came to take our side plates to be boxed up for leftovers.   The side salads weren't bad, but the extra side of bread took nearly 10 minutes to arrive at the table.   Even at the end of the night, after declining dessert, our waitress left us saying \"I know tonight was a disaster, but please come back. I promise it will be better next time\".   The salmon wasn't on the check, so I give points for that, but we will likely never return.   Spare yourself the unpleasant experience and just go to an Olive Garden. At least their bread is always ready!!"}
{"text":"Best Italian food in the area! We love their lunch menu because the prices are very reasonable. Eggplant parmigiana is the best I've ever had. Friendly staff and fast service. Restaurant looks small from the outside but ambiance is great for a business lunch or even a romantic dinner."}
{"text":"Arrabiata's is an Italian restaurant located in the heart of Beachwood - don't let the Strip Mall location scare you away.. the place is actually decent!  The place is fairly crowded (in terms of the number of tables they have pushed together), but they do a good job with Service nonetheless! We were seated immediately and our food was bought out quickly, promptly and hot. We had to try to get the attention of our waitress only once (I think a party of a couple of people had just walked in then), but other than that, the service was smooth.  The only reason this place doesn't get a 4 star rating was the food. The food was almost good, but just not quite. I ordered the Artichoke Hearts D'Agnese ($7), the Broiled Salmon Picatta ($19) that was recommended to me by the server and a Chocolate Cake ($6).  The Artichoke Hearts D'Agnese I really don't have any complaints about. They were pretty solid - not mind blowingly good, but a good dish.   The salmon came with a side salad and a side of pasta, which I had with Marinara sauce. The salad was decent and the pasta not too bad - the marinara was nothing special and could have been out of a jar. The real let down was the Salmon - really good sauce and side vegetable selection, but a massively overcooked salmon! You actually needed a knife to cut through it... it was the first time I have not finished a piece at a restaurant.   The chocolate cake was a triple layer cake with chocolate mousse as filling, and unfortunately seemed a wee bit dry. Good flavours though.  I'm willing to give Arrabiata's the benefit of the doubt and chalk the salmon down to a really busy night. I might try this place again, and if I do, will update.   Overall, as it stands, you can give this place a hit or a miss - was not terribly impressed or disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been here 2x so far & each time I've had a very good experience. The prices are fair & the service was good. I sat at the bar both times. Stuffed peppers were good, side salad was great, filet was good (cooked perfect) & the pasta w/ meat sauce was okay. The tiramisu was very good. Also the bread that was accompanied w/ the meal was very good. Il be back..."}
{"text":"Grab a cozy booth in the bar and try the lemony chicken d'agnese. Most entrees come with a salad. The bread is warm, crusty and comes with an herb butter - so good! Great place for happy hour and appetizers too."}
{"text":"Best Italian restaurant on the east side? Quite possibly. Arrabiata's has everything you could hope for in an Italian restaurant. The great decor makes the restaurant classier than it looks from the outside and makes it a destination location. We've never had a wait, since they are very accommodating with regards to reservations.  Once you've ordered your sure to be phenomenal meal, you're presented with some of the best bread I've ever had. The bread is similar to Vincinatos's....very crispy, but you get some delicious paprika butter that is seriously good. Most meals also come with a salad, which is always a nice touch.  The entrees are, simply put, amazing. The Chicken Arrabiata ranks in my top five favorites at ANY restaurant. This blend of perfectly spicy sauce, hot vegetables, and tender chicken is incredible. I've also tried the Eggplant Parm, which is not too shabby itself.  I honestly can't think of anything bad to say about this restaurant. If you find yourself driving down Mayfield Rd, trying to spot a good restaurant among all of the junk that currently populates Mayfield Rd, do yourself a favor and stop in to Arrabiatas. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Will not be back....oh wait didn't even get to really stay. So rude and snooty from the minute we walked in.. Seriously ?? Train your staff to be polite it's not that hard. I can't stress enough how terrible this was, that on top of the 20 $ pasta a dish. Not worth the visit I can promise you that."}
{"text":"I was not impressed here. My husband and I did not expect such a tiny dining room. We waited about 10 minutes to get seated. It was so loud in there! The busser just drops off bread and butter. He didn't say anything, just plopped it down and was gone.The butter was good. It was like they added marinera sauce to the butter and whipped it.  the hostess was doing a walk around, saw that our bread basket was empty and just picked it up. She didn't say anything or ask if we wanted more.  We both ordered the lasagna with a meatball. It came with a salad which consisted of lettuce, two black olives, a couple pieces of cold pasta, and a very boring house dressing.  The waitress was nice, but not attentive. She was giving other tables good service, but not us. She made sure their glasses were filled and offered to put black pepper on their salads, but not us. She just dropped them (literally) on the table.  The lasagna was served in a VERY hot dish. It had been in the oven. Now you'd think that the food would be as scolding hot as the plate. But noooooooooooooo. The lasagna and meatball wasn't as hot on the inside. The food actually heated up as we ate it the dish was so hot. We asked the manager about it because it was weird and he had no clue. All he could say was \"It's cooked in the oven\". BS, I smell a reheat job. To top it off, the lasagna was bad. there was too much riccotta cheese and the cheese wasn't even seasoned with herbs.  My husband and I figured out our bill and left the money at the table because we couldn't get our waitress's attention. I was very disappointed. I'll just go to Dino's next time I want lasagna."}
{"text":"Happy hour 5-7 PM everyday. Good martini selection. Tried the Summer Wind and the Flirtini. Both very good. The early bird has great options for $11. We had the veal Marsala and veal parmigiana. The Marsala was AMAZING! The sauce is so good. Sometimes you go places and it's too sweet or too bitter, this was just right. The large onions in the sauce threw me off, but they were very good as were the chunks of tomato in the sauce. The portion was just enough to make a satisfying meal.  Fresh bread with sesame seeds and a garlic butter spread. Another yummy treat. We split the tiramisu for dessert. It rivaled the one I make, though I like mine with a little more wet/espresso on my ladyfingers and use chocolate shavings instead of cocoa powder. I would definitely come here again and try some of the other options."}
{"text":"Went there on a date. We got the Seafood Combination Entree for 2. It was AMAZING! Mouthwatering! I think it was around 75 bucks,its for 2 people to split. Seafood lovers heaven! The bread & dipping oil is very good as well. The wait staff was friendly & fast. We will definitely be back to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"The food is average. Ordered the Alfreo and was just ok. My boyfriend ordered chicken Parmesan and wasn't impressed. Service was good though"}
{"text":"Might have been the worst meal I've ever had here. Normally, the good is stellar so I dont know if this was just a fluke, maybe new chef??  Started with the fried calamari....bland and over cooked. Salad with house was as normally expect. Main courses....veal parm with linguini.....veal and sauce were bland. Sauce was extra watery today. Also had the chicken parm with cavatelli. Chicken was ok at best, same runny sauce. Normally have a fantastic meal here.....pretty disappointed today."}
{"text":"Whats not to love; the homemade bread, the whipped garlic butter, the generous servings, and the prompt and friendly service! This place has been serving great Italian food for the last 18 years now, so that speaks for itself; however the standard of quality has not deviated despite the passing of time. Just remember to bring your appetite when you go!"}
{"text":"Service was perfect food was hot. The salad was Crisp the bread was served without asking and was refilled our drinks were served and refilled without asking I ordered the stuff salmon and was a large portion served very hot like right off the grill my friend ordered the veal and he raved about it as being perfect definitely would go back"}
{"text":"Let me say before I start my review that I LOVE GARLIC! The more the better! Having said that I would rate my overall experience as very good. I ordered the salmon Picatta , which came with side salad, side of pasta and bread. The bread was ok but the garlic butter was good. The side salad was different but good ; a combination of lettuce and a tri color rotini, the dressing on it was lite and tasty. The best part of my meal was the salmon. It was perfectly prepared! And very flavorful. The pasta and meatballs was a different thing. Pasta was al dente but the sauce was rather bland for my garlicky taste. The meatballs where just okay. A little heavy on the breadcrumbs and again not enough garlic! I also ordered a bottle of beer with my meal; it was not cold enough and almost room temperature which was disappointing. This was my first time here so I was pleased overall. The service was good. The server was pleasant and attentive. I definitely recommend it and would go back again."}
{"text":"Overall a good experience for an americanized Italian restaurant. Service was excellent, I mean excellent! The menu was great! the location perfect! Food was really good. We had a party of 6. I had the Linguini with white Clam Sauce, This is my goto dish to really evaluate a chef's or cook's skills in the kitchen. It's really easy to mess this dish up, its take a keen eye to get it right. They nailed it. I'm craving it but I'm back in Chicago so I'll have to make my own here at the house!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good.  Their portions are not huge, sometimes I leave a little hungry still definitely over a serving size.  I love their salad, it comes with great dressing, black olives and a little pasta. They have a good wine list and good service.  I feel like they offer healthier alternatives especially for an Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"I grew up in a Italian home in Brooklyn, NY. I have had Italian food in some of the best restaurants in the world and in my own kitchen, but Arrabiata's is my favorite Italian Restaurant hands down. While working for Philips Healthcare in Highland Heights I discovered this place by chance and from the first night there I was hooked. I brought friends and then they brought friends after experiencing this place for themselves. I get Texts from people \"hey guess where we are? Arrabiata's\" This place is a throw back to the old eateries I grew up with in Brooklyn.  I feel so at home that I feel I've been going here my whole life. Anyone who is put off by the ambiance doesn't get it. This is the kinda place Michael Corleone would shoot someone in the head while enjoying the \"Best Veal in town\".  The wine is good and inexpensive. The food is delicious and plentiful. I can't comment on Spaghetti and Meatballs, because Italians never order food they can make at home, but the Veal Sinatra, Veal Sicilian or the Chicken Sorrentino are unbelievable. The hot antipasto for 2 platter can't be beat. Mangia Tutti"}
{"text":"After hearing rave reviews my family and I decided to give it a try...all I can say is the bread was the best part of the meal. The calamari was very tough my son and I both ordered marsala wich tasted like it was poured straight from the marsala wine bottle onto our chicken, the fettuchini had no flavor and the salad was nothing to rave about. For the prices we were charged now that I sit and think about it I should have sent the food back but needless to say we left very dissatisfied and wont be going back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, huge portions, not so good at taking reservations.  The food here is wonderful. A little pricey, but delicious, and a huge menu. Maybe we could have ate more of our entrees if the bread hadn't been so delicious and warm. I got the pasta carbonara, and I still dream about the cheesy goodness with proscuitto added. Yum!! My friend had something with meat sauce, and it was equally good.  Service was good, it was nearly empty when we went and the decor makes it seem more upscale than what you would think from the outside.  The only downside - once we tried to make a reservation for 6 people, and the girl practically cried because she wasn't sure how to do it, however I was glad when we came back (with just two people) because it was well worth it. Maybe this is a better date place than somewhere for a large party, but the food will be wonderful either way!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for years! Every time I go, the service is excellent and the food is consistently good. They have a wonderful early bird special. Must be seated by 6:30. So many delicious choices all come with a very tasty salad with a wonderful dressing and warm minestrone soup. You can pay a tiny bit more for the wedding soup, which I highly recommend. Its very very good. The price for what you get is great, and warm bread with a delicious herb butter is served right away. The manager always says hello and is sweet to my kids. Looks like it could be a great place to sit at the bar for a cocktail as well. The only thing I would say could stand to be improved would be the bathrooms. They could use an overhaul."}
{"text":"Honestly never in my life have i met a waitress so rude. It was honestly laughable how Innapropriate the staff was. The food there wasnt good at all something went downhill from the last few times ive been there. The veal parmesan i ordered was honestly overpriced and honestly i aint even a good cook and i have done a better job making veal Parmesan at home which is what i should of done. the veal was extremely chewy. the pre breaded veal you buy at the store is way more tender and better tasting then what i was served. I would of not been harsh if i was at least treated a little better by the staff. Im actually very easy to please despite how i may seem in this harsh review but i will not be going back."}
{"text":"Was in the area, looking for a place for a late lunch and stopped in.  Hard to see location in a strip mall.  Nice, clean interior.  Menu fairly large for lunch.  Salads were nice, generous portions.  Caprese salad especially good.  Pasta and sauce was OK, portions generous.  Service was friendly and attentive.  They need to lose the music, which would be something my parents would like, and I am in my 50's.  Overall OK, but not great experience."}
{"text":"If you are looking for contemporary Italian food, this is not the place to go.  If you are looking for classic Italian/American food, you will love this place!  I really like family owned restaurants, and this place certainly has that vibe.  It feels like there are a lot of regulars, and a lot of families come here for dinner.  Menu is basic, and they have an early bird menu.  Side salads have anipasto mixed in, house dressing is good.  Portions are good sized for what you pay.  Food was well prepared and the sauces tastes home made.  Desserts were somewhat uninspiring.  Overall, a good experience."}
{"text":"This is some good eating.  The chicken parm with eggplant parm was wonderful.  The bread was excellent.  Very friendly service. It seems like the menu is a little heavy on the cream sauces.  We used a coupon and they were not snooty at all. Some of the best American/Italian food I have had. dishes about 15$ to 23$.  Nice salad dressing"}
{"text":"This was my wife and I first visit. So overall it was okay. So the bread with herb butter was okay to good. The dinner salad was good to very good. Their house dressing was tasty and the right size for a starter. I had the veal Sinatra in which the sauce  sauce was  tasty and unique but the consistency of the veal was a little less tender than I am used to. My wife had the chicken parm, which she and I have to say was not good. The chicken parm was loaded with chunks of garlic under the cheese so every bite was a hit in the face with garlic. The chicken itself with the breading was a little mushy. The side of pasta with marinara sauce was the complete opposite of the chicken sauce a it lacked any flavor. The tiramisu was okay to good but not the best I had. I therefore give it a solid 3. We will likely not return as there are better options near us but it was worth a shot as I like to try new places."}
{"text":"I just left Arrabiata. I had eggplant parmasean and meatballs. It was bland,( eggplant-no coating,frying,seasoning) with over-cooked pasta and so-so meatballs. The service was spotty and my waitress tried to short change me!!  Never again!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with a wedding party for the rehearsal dinner.  While I'm sure this restaurant has some great offerings, the limited main courses we were served left me unimpressed.  I believe we had the veal parmigiana, some sort of chicken with capers, and a pasta dish.  All were OK, but definitely not blow-me-out-of-the-water good like I'd expect from an independent Italian joint.  Wish I had a chance to  try the calamari someone else recommended, or the specials listed at the door.  Also, it seemed to be like pulling teeth getting them to bring us basic things like bread, water, etc.  If I ever find myself in Cleveland again, I'll try this place again and perhaps it'll be better."}
{"text":"We were part of a group of 40 and were seated in a separate room from the other restaurant diners.  The room was beautiful but they should have limited it to fewer people.  We were packed in like sardines and it was HOT!   That actually is an understatement.  It was like a sauna.   Putting that part aside, which is why I didn't give this place 5 stars, our meals were all great.   We had many servers and they were all very efficient.   I had the veal Parmesan which was 4 very tender medallions of veal with a good sauce and cheese.    I will say the salad was a bit disappointing.  It was greens with a half slice of cucumber, 2 black olives and 2 slices of pepperoni.  The side of linguini was very good also.  Their homemade Italian dressing was good.  They served hot bread first which was great, and gobbled up quickly by our table, but never replenished.   All in all, good food, but we couldn't wait to get out of there since it was so hot."}
{"text":"Have been here 3-4x over the past 5 years and have liked it less each time. Visited this past Friday and ordered rigatoni. They were out of rigatoni? and do not serve spaghetti? (There is a grocery store a block away - go buy some friggin' rigatoni, lol). The waitress offered me linguini or bow tie pasta instead, neither of which appealed to me so I ordered the cavatelli, arrabiata style. Fiancee also got the cavatelli but with regular marinara sauce. The cavatelli was supposed to come with meatballs but apparently the arrabiata sauce was considered an \"upgrade\" for me (even though they were out of the rigatoni I wanted) so she got meatballs with hers while I did not.  The bread and seasoned butter were enjoyable, as was the house salad although nothing special. The arrabiata sauce was way spicier than I remember. I generally like it pretty hot but this was a bit too much and it was really loaded with banana peppers. Meanwhile, fiancee's cavatelli was very bland but the meatball was pretty good. Neither of us ate even half of our meals despite being hungry after being on the road all day. Fortunately she had a coupon so it wasn't a total disappointment."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant. Delicious, creative meal. Courteous staff. Lovely location for a party."}
{"text":"Highlights: Plenty of seating and didn't have to wait, good happy hour martini prices ($5), cannolis were very good, fresh warm bread w/ garlic butter.  Cons: Boring pasta sauce!!! This is the primary staple in an Italian restaurant! There wasn't any hint of garlic or any seasoning. The veal was also boring with no flavor. We had ordered the veal parmasean and veal marsala. The marsala sauce was a bit too sweet, as compared to what you're usually used to.   The only reason we went there was because of a coupon. I wouldn't go back because there are plenty of other places to try when I get in the mood for Italian food."}
{"text":"Food is so-so. Service is 7 out of 10 (don't rush me), Wedding soup is great, but far less salt would be great. Not very authentic at all.  Filthy table cloths, it was disgusting, wash them.  The best part was definitely the bread and the amazing butter."}
{"text":"You have to try the Veal Sinatra... One of the most unique Dishes I've ever had!  Servers were great, lots of selection!"}
{"text":"3 Stars giving because of how long it took for our meal to arrive. Although the server was extremely attentive and apologetic.  This is small non decript building is alot bigger than it looks. Kinda on the pricey side for what's being served. I ordered the lasagna and it was good but small for the price. Plus the side of Italian Sausage tasted as if it was boiled. I enjoy authentic Italian and I might have to try them one more time because they have potential!! The Wine was Great!!"}
{"text":"Love going here! Nice little Italian place in bay village. I always request morgan as a Server she is amazing and on top of everything. The lunch is normally a good deal! Good food with a friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is the best Italian food I've ever had. The ambiance is great, the service was excellent and the food is incredible!"}
{"text":"We came into Arrabiata's last night after heading back to our side of town from Patterson's Fruit Farm. Some family members we were with stated that this was some of their favorite Italian food in the Cleveland area, so we decided to give it a try.   Arrabiata's is located in one of the little strip malls on Mayfield and inside you will find it to be your classic family-run Italian environment. The tables are nicely set, complete with your cloth napkin folded into a flower. Very cute touch. Other than that, it is pretty classic with no major decor frills and a standard look that seems to have been there since the restaurant opened 18 years ago.   We were greeted immediately and seated. We managed to beat the Saturday dinner rush which seemed to occur as we were leaving, around 6pm. (The restaurant was completely full when we left).   Let me just get this out of the way right now: our server was phenomenal. She had a great personality, did not mess up a single thing, remained attentive throughout the meal and she made sure to suggest every option available to us from dipping oils for the (wonderful) Italian bread, to what hidden menu items there are. She was wonderful and I wish I could remember her name!   Now to the food. I can boldly say you will not leave hungry. You start with the Italian bread (which was my favorite part about the evening) and a paprika butter. *Hidden menu item tip: they have a roasted red pepper dipping oil to go with bread, but only by request. You should request it-yes you!*  After the bread, which our waitress was attentive enough to give us time to consume before we moved on, out came our salads. Each speciality dinner entree comes with a salad, adding to my promise that you will not leave hungry. The house Italian dressing is delicious and there is even cold pasta salad mixed in with your greens. I enjoyed this salad! After completion of the salads our waitress ensured we were ready and then she brought the entrees out.   All four of us ordered something different, but I had my go-to Italian dish: eggplant parm. All speciality dishes also come with a side of pasta (which you can choose from linguini, rigatoni, cavatelli, penne, etc.) I stayed traditional with the linguini and the amount of food I received was enormous! **I did not ask if there are GF pasta options but I did not see any notations on the menu. Since last night I was going full-on cheat, I ate normal pasta. It would be a plus if they had GF options but unfortunately I cannot advise.**  Unfortunately, I have to get a little picky on the gravy (sauce, marina, whatever you identify with it as). Though I know all family recipes differ, the gravy was a little bitter to me and chunkier than I like. The pasta was cooked to perfection with just the right amount of al dente. The eggplant was decent but could have used a little more of a crunch to it and the breading had a slight grit to it. The distaste was minor, though, and I completed the meal. I just cannot rank it on the top of my eggplant parm experiences. The other dishes ordered: lasagna with meatballs, chicken marsala, and chicken cacciatore and all of these individuals also enjoyed their meals. Two felt was 5 star worthy and one felt 3.5-4 star worthy.  In closing, I was torn between a 3 or 4 stars on this review but honestly felt that with the service we received and the fact that there are definite high notes to the menu and food items, three just seemed too low. Come here and expect to find a low key environment with traditional Italian food. Just because my Italian food preference is one way does not mean you will find yours to be the same. Arrabiata's seems to have a solid following, with many diners seeming to be regulars. There is a bit of everything on the menu so hopefully there is something for everyone. If you come here knowing this is not a 5 star establishment, but a chill family Italian spot, you will enjoy it more.  As always, if I believe there is enough good to a restaurant I will leave you with this in my review: it is worth a try for you to form your own opinion! Happy dining!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for over 15 years... wow I feel old! I have always had delicious food. I'm vegan, and still find great options. The servers are always very helpful. My Italian husband approves too! He applauds their homemade pasta. Only caution, the Arrabiata is verrrry spicy, and I like it hot!"}
{"text":"It is always a good idea to go to Arrabiata's. A family run restaurant with  an extensive menu. Great veal and pasta and genuine service."}
{"text":"This is the best Italian restaurant in the Cleveland area.  My wife and I have been coming here forever and not once have we been disappointed.  Oh and the bread with the seasoned butter is simply awesome."}
{"text":"I was disappointed in Arrabiata's. The food was OK; the service was the really disappointing part. Our server said my daughter was \"too cute\" to need to order a drink. Um, what?! Then, we had to ask multiple times to receive bread, when the little one obviously needed something to snack on. On top of that start, our water wasn't refilled in a timely matter.  As I said, the food was OK, but there wasn't really anything to make me want to come back. I've heard good reviews before, so hopefully this was just an off night."}
