{"text":"Had a wonderful lunch sitting on the patio on a hot July day. The interior and patio decor are appropriate and fun. The patio has an out of this city feel. You do not know your sitting in a parking lot next to MEC. I had the tuna and it was served very quickly. The meal was very nice and for some maybe perfect but I am more picky and would give it an 8 out of 10. I would have use a bit more flavour in the side veggies. The tuna was very nice although I have had better. Maybe a little over cooked or not as fresh. Hey your in Calgary how fresh can it be. The service was top notch and our server was informed, happy and attentive. The price was as I would have expected for DT Calgary. I would come again and next time for dinner. I recommend you give it a try and bring a date. Even a first date would be nice."}
{"text":"Whaaat? I had no idea this place existed, or that this was inside the building that faces the street. My BF and I decided to try it after we saw it's glowing reviews on Yelp and were looking for a good Italian restaurant. It's very warm and inviting inside and the food was incredible. Once again - more vegetarian options would be nice and it was a bit too pricey to go often but we'll definitely come here on another special occasion."}
{"text":"Lovely dinner. Went here for a special meal. The service was great. The linguine carbonara was in my boyfriends top 3 (and he is a tough customer), my duck was excellent. Thoroughly enjoyed and would be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! From the street you would never know the gem contained inside. They really take the time to make sure you enjoy the experience from the moment you step in the door. Typically I would go into more details about the food, but it would almost ruin it to not allow you to experience it for yourself. The kitchen works so harmoniously, it is like watching a chef Ramsey show. The food has so many flavors, specialty items are put into dishes directly from Italy, and the veggies are all fresh and I dare say organic. You will enjoy yourself immensely."}
{"text":"In Calgary for a few days for work and I am using YELP to help me find great eats near my hotel.  I had dinner last night at Bonterra and it was AMAZING. I had the Insalata Cato which was romaine, capers, grapes, oranges, grana padano cheese, wild boar bacon to start and then I had the Ravioli al Manzo which was shortrib and prosciutto with grilled rapini, porcini cream, pecorino and it was all SUPER DELICIOUS. I thought the grapes and oranges in the salad would be meh, I typically do not like fruit in my salad but it was amazing and I ate up every bite!"}
{"text":"Stepping into Bonterra for the first time, I was initially struck by how different it was from my expectations.  I had walked past it many times, and from the outside, I was imagining a smaller, more confined space.   Maybe a \"mom and pop\" with a few tables.  Perhaps this is because of the dimensions of the storefront, or just its general location.    However, inside Bonterra is spacious yet warm; and inviting in general.    First impressions?    I like this place.   I like the look and feel, and I immediately wanted to spend time here . . .   Our group was larger, a collection of a dozen or so colleagues meeting for lunch.  Most in our group opted for the pasta dishes, or soups / salads.  In my case, I tried the braised lamb & proscuitto gnocchi.  But under the \"Secondi\" lunch menu items, there were a number of seafood, veal, and chicken items, that all looked very intriguing to me.   The lighter fare were chosen by us, as we didn't have a lot of time for lunch.  As it turns out, though, it took a little longer than expected for our food to arrive.     This may be because of our larger group, or maybe because we jumped the lunch prep a bit with our 11:30 reservation.  That being said, a slower pace wasn't necessarily a bad thing.  The ambience is worth enjoying, and in the right context--socializing with friends, or conducting business over a meal--it would be just fine.    Time would have been an issue for the more regimented, \"you get an hour for lunch\" types.   For us, not so much.  The meals were all enjoyed - no complaints by anyone in the group.   Only praise.  I did make a note of returning for dinner some time, though, to enjoy more courses than time allowed on this visit.  From appetizers, through mains, through desert, there was a lot to be explored.    And next summer is a must:  the photos of the patio I have seen online look amazing.      Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012 - 19/30"}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed dinner at  Bonterra while visiting Calgary from San Francisco.  The bright and spacious atmosphere, interesting menu, attentive service, and first-rate wine list combined to make for a tasty night out that I would recommend to anyone looking for a relatively upscale Italian dinner in Calgary.  We enjoyed a caprese sald with mozzarella di buffala, which hit the right notes using seasonal fresh tomatoes and the buffala mozzarella to savor.  I had the carbonara, which was rich and eggy as it should be; the pasta was housemade and appropriately al dente.  My wife had a risotto, which didn't quite meet expectations, but was enjoyable nonetheless.  We finished with panna cotta and vin santo that were truly wonderful together -- maybe the highlight of the meal.  As for the wine, there is a huge selection -- including plentiful wines by the glass.  The iPad guide to their wine list was fun to explore and is a great tool for navigating their wine cellar, though we relied upon our server for recommendations (we were happy with her suggestions).  Lastly, it bears mentioning that in response to our inquiry about taxi availability, our server called a taxi and had it waiting for us outside when we finished our meal.  It was a nice touch.  I have enjoyed first-rate Italian food in San Francisco, Chicago, and throughout Italy.  Given the price point and the atmosphere, and based on only one visit, I would recommend Bonterra to anyone looking for a well-executed Italian dinner that hits some high notes and demonstrates commitment to authentic Italian cuisine."}
{"text":"This is a situation I would expect to happen at Denny's... or not even.  The prices seem to reflect an attempt to be a high-class eatery but it completely misses the mark in my book. Our party was showered with shattered glass after a glass was broken while the waiter was attempting to deliver a glass of wine.  The server immediately (I mean the glass had not even settled) turned and walked away to get a napkin to clean it up instead of taking a brief moment to see if everyone was ok, or ask if everyone was alright, and say \"I'll be right back to clean this up\".  We all laughed it off so that it wouldn't cause a scene.   I found glass on myself later - in my hair and on my clothes.   I was covered in wine, and I believe the people behind us were as well.  The glass could have very easily ended up in my eye instead of in my hair.  He brusquely took away all of the dishes and delivered new ones and napkins.  Even though no one was at fault, it would have been nice to have been offered an apology and check on our well-being.  Maybe offer a free bottle of wine or no-charge for one of our entrees?  Some kind of gesture over the situation?  Again, even though no one was at fault, WE are the customers, and it is THEIR job to ensure we are happy, comfortable, and fed. When I called the manager to tell him our feelings about the situation, he indicated that he was right there when it happened and he was the person to help clean it up.  As the waiter left to get napkins to clean it up, the manager left to get another glass of wine.  So I'm thinking \"You were right there and you didn't check on us either?\".  The concern was to get it cleaned up, and replace the wine, not the fact that glass and wine was all over us.   He listened and sympathized, but it felt like lip service.  There is no incentive for me to return, so I won't.  Again, no apology, just an offer to talk to the server. Not to mention: I sat there for 10 minutes waiting for the rest of my party and I was not greeted or offered a drink at all.  I had to flag down the hostess (who WAS very apologetic). Oh, the food?  Average.  It was fine.   I wouldn't say that it was above the level of what one would get anywhere else.  The wine menu was great, however.  Atmosphere was welcoming and warm.  Just a little  side review for those who didn't come to read just venting, LOL!  Review #3 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012"}
{"text":"A perfect evening at Bonterra.   The waitress was wonderful, friendly and informative while allowing our table to enjoy the amazing food.   Started with a cinzano rosso. This is a very refreshing mix of fortified red wine and soda. Recommended by the waitress and both delicious and different.   We ordered the two person three course meal and changed up the pastas. The kitchen was busy and was still willing to cater this request. Thanks!   The salad had a good mix of flavor and crunch from the dressing and almonds, very good.   Both the linguine carbonara and the tagliatelle vongole were perfectly cooked and very flavorful.   The rack of pork entree was a very generous portion with a ton of side dishes. The spice rub on the outside was delicious and the meat was tender and moist.   Sat at the table for hours just enjoying the ambiance, sight and sounds of the restaurant. The waitress even brought an on-the house dessert wine. It was called Electra and was a perfect ending to a perfect meal.   Bravo Bonterra, I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This restaurant gets a 4+ star from me. Definitely a very solid place.   I went here twice this past week during a work trip. My first experience was a 5 star. Jeremy was an awesome waiter and the Arctic Char was really delicious.  My second experience was good, not great. The risotto was pretty good, but nowhere near as good as the Arctic Char. Overall this place gets a 4+ from me. Worth a visit."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of enjoying the 4 course meal for 2 last evening at Bonterra Trattoria. The restaurant was hopping when we arrived for our sitting, the atmosphere was incredible and the serving staff were on their game on this night.  Just an incredible experience from every angle.  The 4 or 5 or 6 course meal (I lost count) was unbelievable.   Every course was immaculately prepared and presented and paired with a glass of wine.  Some highlights included the Prosciutto, Capelletti, Artic Char (10/10), and Strip Loin.  The food just kept on coming and the service provided was excellent.  The wine pairings were spot on and the sommelier was super fun to talk to about the selections.  Our server was a really fun guy as well, just loved our evening.  An incredible dining experience we won't soon forget.  We'll be back soon to dine on the back deck!  Thank you Bonterra Trattoria!"}
{"text":"My second visit to Bonterra and no disappointment in terms of food quality and taste.    We sat up in the wine room which is a little more private for actually meeting.  I would recommend it as the open dining room has a seen and be seen type of feel, and naturally, it gets quite loud.    Ordered the Lamb Soup which was perfect for the chilly day which was executed well with a dollop of pureed beans added to the slightly spicy broth and the tender chunks of lamb.  For the main, I ordered a half order of the Risotto alla Barbabietola which was a delicious and well executed interpretation including cubes of beet and crushed pistachio. My dining companion ordered a half of the Spaghetti alla Puttanesca and he was impressed.  The wine list is expansive obviously slanting towards Italy however there are great choices from around the world. Pricing around these is typical restaurant.     Overall, the total with a San Pelegrino came to $50 pre tip which isn't a value lunch by any stretch.  That said, the environment is cool and food is delicious.  Recommended as a splurge or to impress."}
{"text":"Just came here last night for a birthday dinner for my fiance.   Great rustic atmosphere with brick walls, high ceilings, couches and candlelight. The veranda out back is even nicer in the summer time - really romantic. Really lovely place that you wouldn't expect from the exterior view.   The server was awfully rude. My fiance says it's just his style but i expect a smile with my service.   There were complimentary bread sticks and bread. I expected the bread to be piping hot fresh out of the oven but maybe i have too high of expectations. :P  We ordered: Appetizers: Veal meatballs and calamari.  Both were delicious, I don't eat squid but i ate a few of the calamari, they had a very distinctive taste and were really delicious.  For pastas we ordered 2 of each: the Seafood Spaghetti (there is another name for it but i forget) and the Linguine Carbonara. Both were delicious and everyone thought so.     Really delicious food, we could come back but maybe ask for a different waiter. :)  Few things to note: the dinner menu online is not the most up-to-date one.  There is parking spots in the back but not a lot , there is also an entrance in the back. I would make reservations before hand as it seems to be a very popular place."}
{"text":"Welcoming, elegant and rustic are the three words that sum up my first impressions of this restaurant.   In summary, I would definitely recommend this restaurant. The food is delicious and the servers are attentive, helpful and friendly.   I've been to this restaurant two times and I've been more than pleased on both visits. My first visit was about a year ago with my boyfriend and the second today, with my awesome ladies. Being that my visit a year ago was so wonderful, I wanted to try Bonterra's Big Taste Menu (2015). Although the portion sizes were small, I was definitely pleased with the delicious menu. On the menu for $25:  Course 1 Tortelloni - Shortrib tortelloni, brodo, white truffle oil  Course 2 Veal - Veal striploin, eggplant caponata  Course 3 Pavlova - Almond pavlova, vanilla bean meringue, almond cake, mascarpone mousse, chocolate  Impressions: The tortelloni was very delicate, savoury and melt in your mouth amazing. The truffle oil was a nice touch. It was enough to enhance the flavour of the brodo and complement the short rib tortelloni.   The veal was tender and cooked perfectly. It was pink on the inside and toasty brown on the outside. The flavours were light allowing you to taste the sweetness of the veal. The eggplant caponata was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. A rather unique texture contrast.   The pavlova was presented in a very fun and different manner. The almond cake was moist, the vanilla bean meringue had a nice crunch and the mascarpone added a nice creamy touch.  I will definitely go back to this place!"}
{"text":"This is a classic Italian restaurant with a unique menu, a great wine list, and a warm, homey atmosphere. The real fireplace adds to the ambiance. I do recommend it, if that's what you're in the mood for. We had a great appetizer of porcini mushrooms, and some decent grilled octopus. No complaints!  However, when the menu offers to top any salad with chorizo sausage, I expect it to come on top, or be integrated with the salad somehow. Instead, I get a rectangular plate with the salad on one end (an excellent Insalata Cato) a full, undressed sausage on the other (a delicious sausage), and a gulf of plain white plate in between. It's a bizarre presentation that does nothing to pull these flavours together.  How can I say this delicately? My salad had a big wiener on the side."}
{"text":"Dinner there tonight. Decided for a Tuesday to try to get onto the patio without a reservation but wait list too long. Seated inside, friendly hostess said they were very busy for a Tuesday. This was confirmed by very slow service. We were patient but really not impressed with our server. She was most unfriendly and did not seem interested in even attempting to at least pretend to be helpful. She was much friendlier to a large group, but I wonder if it was anticipatory tip behaviour. Caprese was delicious, but two halibut dishes less so as fish in both the  puttanesca and the main were too well done. We skipped dessert and coffee as we had been there far to long as it was. To be honest I wonder if the poor service and significant delays made us perceive the food as less desirable so may not write it off.....yet."}
{"text":"I'm gonna say Bonterra is up there for best Italian in the city!  A girlfriend and I decided to grab a bite to eat before heading to an event and we got seated in their beautiful garden patio. Sitting there, it didn't even feel like we were in the middle of downtown anymore!  Not wanting to be too full, we shared the linguine carbonara with a side of chicken and since we took a quick glance at the dessert menu (panna cotta!) we decided to skip on appetizers even though they almost lured me in!  The service on the patio is great, our server made it such a pleasant experience. Honestly, had we not had other arrangements we probably would have sat there all evening sipping wine and enjoying the tranquil ambiance.  Do yourself a favor and head to Bonterra sometime and hang out on their patio, it'll be the best thing you ever did!"}
{"text":"Very warm and comfortable atmosphere. Top notch service. Food was really good.  I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Okay Bonterra. You redeemed yourself. After the \"dancing worm incident\" of 2012, I vowed never to return. But then I met a new friend who absolutely loves it there. So one night I came back. I was hesitant about giving you a second chance. But the food was great and the service was too. But I still wasn't totally sold.  Then you opened Posto...I do really like it there and haven't had any problems. On a few more occasions I came back to Bonterra (usually when Posto was full) and continued to get wonderful food and attentive, much more genuine service than what I had a couple of years ago.  A couple of weeks ago, while eating some delicious risotto at your bar, my friend (the one who loves you) asked if I have finally forgiven you. Good question.  I thought about my earlier experience and Yelp review. And I've decided that I have. So here is the updated one.  Bonterra is a great spot for lunch or dinner. The servers are all friendly and knowledgeable and can make great suggestions. Whether you sit at the bar or at a table, the experience is good (they can be a bit different though).   I would offer a tip though that you maybe reno your washrooms. They don't reflect the calibre of restaurant I think you'd like to be and are often not as tidy/clean as they could be. Just a suggestion.  I'm glad we are friends again."}
{"text":"Bonterra Trattoria is amazing Italian cuisine in a relaxed funky atmosphere.   The interior is cozy in the best sense of the word and the staff make you feel right at home. Then the food arrived and nothing else mattered - succulent lamb, heavenly carbonara, soft, fresh mozzarella, and (by far) the best meal on the table was the gnocchi. It was melt-in-your-mouth delicious - just beyond superb and I will be back just for that dish.  If you are visiting Calgary this should be on your must try list of restaurants."}
{"text":"Bonterra is one of those places I always forget I love until I eat there again. Earlier this week, we had a goodbye dinner at Bonterra. We had a huge (loud) group but we had an amazing dinner. We started by telling our waiter to bring us a selection of appetizers. They were all great but the risotto balls were the stand out. I want to go back and eat ONLY risotto balls for dinner.  Since I ate so many starters, I couldn't eat a big meal. So I ate the fantabulous caprese salad.  YUM!   All in all, the service and the food were wonderful. The space is pretty echoey so it can get very loud if there's a big group."}
{"text":"I took my friend out for his birthday dinner to Bonterra yesterday (April 1, 2015) and we treated so well that it became a very memorable dinner. We tried the famous meatballs and I have to say they definitely lived up to all the expectations. I got the handmade sausage pasta for my main and my friend got rabbit meat pasta. He prefers spicy food so he didn't seem to like his food too much but guess what, the incredibly nice server realized that he didn't like it very much and replaced his pasta with a great recommendation of carbonara ( which was definitely very spicy and just right for my friend) FREE OF CHARGE!!!! we got cheesecake for dessert and again our server was so nice as to light the sparkler (that i brought for fun) and present it as a birthday dessert for my friend. I was really impressed by the service, the food was great and hell yes I AM COMING BACK HERE ALL THE TIME!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place because I know when I go that there'll be gluten free options (pasta, at that) to choose from.  Food is sometimes a little too salty for my liking - and service isn't always as good if you're not ordering wine BUT still a favorite of mine.  Patio is a hidden gem in the summer."}
{"text":"Bonterra has provided my (now) finance and I the most memorable restaurant experiences bar none. Every time we go, we end of having a blast, eating several courses through to dessert and coffee. Great ambiance, the patio is fantastic in the summer, and in 5 years, I've never seen it slow. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I love Bonterra! Go here all the time and the food has never been short of amazing! It's a tight packed busy little restaurant and can get quite noisy, so make sure you're up for that. If you're looking for something more quite/romantic they do have a couple private tables at the back which are nice."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable team lunch held at Bonterra, we started with a variety of appies including a plate of assorted slices meats and cheeses, calamari (the real thing) and a very nice coarse hummus with sliced toasted bread chips.    For the main I went with the Linguni Carbonara with wild boar bacon, the pasta was also authentic, the sauce rich, creamy and smoky from the bacon.  The portion size was the size of a small fist but was plenty given the richness.  Atmosphere was very comfortable, staff attentive and experienced...definitely a place I'd revisit with my wife."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, the atmosphere was warm and inviting, but I think the best thing about Bonterra was the service.  During our business dinner we were blessed with a waiter who took genuine pride in what he was doing and the food he was representing.  He described with great detail the restaurant's signature dishes and their reasons for being so.   He also described the chef's use of seasonal vegetables in the feature dishes in such a way that made it impossible not to order them.  I had the risotto with fresh corn and mushrooms.  I'm not always a risotto fan when there are pasta dishes around, but this was delicious!  Also amazing was the warm tomato and goat cheese salad, which was made with garden fresh tomatoes.  So fresh!  I'm not from Calgary, but whenever I visit I will be sure to return to Bonterra!"}
{"text":"DOUBLE THUMBS UP!  From services to decoration, there is nothing for me to complain about.   First off - Service is excellent @ Bonterra.  Everyone is so friendly and attentive.  It gives you this \"welcoming\" feeling when you are in the restaurant.   I went there for lunch the other day with a couple of my coworkers, and let me tell ya....at the end of our feast, we were more than satisfied.    We ordered two appetizers - Calamari and Polpette di Vitello (veal meatballs, tomato, basil, grana padano, extra virgin olive oil).   Mmmmm the Calamari was one of the best I have ever had.  It was tender and flavorful.  It was perfect.  The Polpette di Vitello was delicious.  I know it sounds really odd but I actually love the basil tomato sauce more than the meatballs.     For entree, I ordered the  Linguine Carbonara.  I like how you can order half size for the entree.  It was superb.....but what I am more fond of is their dessert.  If you dine at an Italian restaurant, it does NOT matter how full you are, you HAVE to have their dessert - tiramisu.  I am not even gonna try to use words to describe how delicious their tiramisu is.  You just have to go to Bonterra and try it yourself.  It is THAT good!!!!    Honestly, I think Bonterra is on the more expensive side but you do get what you paid for - good food, good service, good atmosphere.  What else do you ask for when you dine in a restaurant?"}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant I've come across in calgary, pure and simple.  The first time we went was right after the 2010 Olympic hockey finals (Yeah canada!) and we didn't want to make any decisions...so we asked our waiter to take care of picking things for us.  Best decision ever.  He took personal pride in making sure that every aspect of our meal was phenomenal, including convincing the chefs to make something that wasn't even on the menu for us...and then gave us a break on the bill.    We've been back several times and it's always the same, great food, great service and without that air of pomposity too that often comes with fine dining.  Excellent!"}
{"text":"Be prepared to read a completely bipolar review of this restaurant.   Recently heard great reviews of this italian gem so decides to check it out for dinner. The restaurant is esthetically very beautiful and has probably the nicest patio I have seen in Calgary. You must make a reservation to sit outside because it's definitely more desirable than an inside table. There are two entrances into the building. One entrance from 8th street, and one from the parking lot. This is important because if you come in from 8th street there is no hostess or anyone who will greet you to let you know this isn't the entrance where the hostess is available to seat you. After waiting 5 minutes I flagged down a waiter. Why I had to flag him down is confusing to me as he obviously saw us waiting at the front entrance. He was courteous enough to find the hostess and we then were seated inside. There are two places you can be seated at Bonterra, the patio and the twilight zone. Our seat placement was the latter. Where is the waiter? Looking around the place people are sitting with water, crossed arms, and a confused look on their face. Once our waiter approached our table, he never greeted us but instead stood there and stared at us.  We ordered an appetizer and a glass of wine (after my dinner companion took on the servers role and asked what I wanted to order! ). Filling water glasses across the restaurant was an obvious priority for our server. Also, the unhygienic method of wiping sweat from his brow with his hand then serve tables really stirred up our appetite. When someone finally returned 25 minutes later to take our entree order we asked for the bill. Without question he left and brought the bill... this should probably indicate something is wrong? Quickly paying and leaving wasn't an option as there was no one available to help us with this! So, having to once again find someone for assistance, we went up to the bar and paid as if this is some hot dog stand on stephen ave.  This is not an isolated event, no one around us even had meals by the time we left. This could easily been just a terrible sequence of events...but considering \"benefit of the doubt\" wasn't on the menu, I couldn't order it."}
{"text":"Pretty good Italian, with a fabulous outdoor dining area.  The gnocchi was well made and served with a fresh zingy sauce.  There is some hidden parking around the back."}
{"text":"Very good food with a fine-dining feel at a reasonable price. Really good location for a date.  Their pastas can also be done gluten-free."}
{"text":"Went here last night, I ordered the Arctic char thinking it would be like the one on the picture in their website but it wasn't.  I found my dish on the salty side, the proportion was just right. I also tried the linguine and it was OK, was not super thrilled.  I did not like the open kitchen concept, I felt nauseated the whole time from the smells of the kitchen and when we came home, we smelled like pasta.  Nothing too special for me about this restaurant."}
{"text":"My wife and I were gifted a date night out to this place for a wedding gift from a good friend of ours and we were blown away, service was AMAZING, food was to DIE FOR and they even sat us right next to a real fire place and kept us EXTRA cozy all night. Definitely recommend to any one and if you get the chance ask for JOHN he's the MAN"}
{"text":"2 Stars at best for the food and 4 stars for the service...  We came into Bonterra sans resos and it was quite busy... we were just in time to snag a table for 2 that was being vacated. They have a nice bar and we would have been totally fine being seated there as well.  Our server was great, he was knowledgeable about the menu and was open to discussing his fave dishes.  We started out with drinks and appies which included the meatballs (wow, you get a load of them so keep this in mind) and also the tomato and shrimp bisque which was on the Specials menu for $8. Both were very good and we should have stopped there.  Ordered for mains were the sausage pizza on Special ($17 - yikers!) and the gnocchi which was the waiters' fave dish.  The pizza was OK. Nowhere near mind-blowing. The gnocchi was horrrible and while I almost never send a dish back, it was inedible,- so I did return it. The texture of it for me I guess was what it was. The dumplings were huge and just kind of sogged in the mouth with a nothing ricotta-supposed-to-be there-ness. Yuck. This was of course taken off the bill and almost the entire pizza was packed up to go. I was offered another dish and I just could not choose anything. The menu itself was minimalistic which at times is great but in this case I found the pasta options to be few. EX no fettuccine, no alfredo, very little seafood.  The atmosphere was very classy and authentic Italian. It was worth the trip just to experience the restaurant, the great red wine and the service but the food was not up to par.  Would only return if invited."}
{"text":"Had a lovely time at Bonterra. My experience may be slightly different than  others, as we sat at the bar and got quite a bit of conversation in with the bartender and some of the staff. I've mentioned this in other reviews; when the staff is super into the food they create, it gets the patrons into it.  I was very lucky to have one of their signature one-off charcuterie boards explained to me by the head chef, who made the selections. I had never had swordfish gravlax but let me tell you.. spectacular. The bison carpaccio was a surprisingly large portion and exploding with flavour--it came with sunchoke chips which is something I've never had before but was absolutely killer (where can I buy a bag)?  Service was very good, though that could be because we were at the bar. I didn't go five seconds without bread being restocked on my plate. The food came out quickly despite the rush. Drinks were served with care, showcasing an excellent wine and gin selection.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Ate there on a whim while walking by. Without a doubt one of the best meals I've ever had.  The Fagiolo was superb... The risotto among the best I've tasted.  When in Calgary.... VISIT!"}
{"text":"Decided to check out Bonterra Trattoria for myself, and found out that, despite the plain front hunkered down on the 8th Street sidewalk, it's actually a fine dining venue, which is fine with me, as I've enjoyed some such in the past. And for those out-of-the-know, there's plenty of parking in the rear that Bonterra will gladly cover for you.  Fine dining.  The nicely-appointed indoor front section welcomes with a strong earth-toned decor, and the kitchen action in the dusky interior is somewhat visible. Not as open or breathy as Mercado, but welcome on a cold winter evening.  In the back is a large patio with aged slightly-rusting metal tables, lotsa dirt on an unswept brick floor, and many shrubs and hanging plants. Pleasant enough.  While waiting, I noticed a sparrow quietly fly in to drink from a metal ornament hanging on the back wall. Very natural; quite lovely. Upstairs is more dining area and private rooms best suited to large groups or select parties.  The meal. As my partner was working evenings, I was alone, and so ordered the Uovo Pollo comprised of a wee stack of linguine pasta crowned by the soft-poached egg, somewhat-charred but tasteless broccolini shoots, and milky drippings over a tender breast & thigh of chicken. Mildly delicious, the chicken was shrouded in partially-grilled somewhat fatty skin, and adorned by a small portion of under-grilled red meat near the bone. But...  Why no bread service?! The foccacia or ciabatta on other tables looked great, but without some to accompany my entree, it was like eating sans pantaloon. Really! Overall quite nice, nonetheless, but without a wow in flavours or in its stock presentation, was it worth the visit? Not really, even as I searched for some superlatives by which to praise this chef's 'creation.' Alas, my mind instead wandered to \"I wonder if Portofino in Cochrane will be better...?'  Service. It wasn't busy yet, but overall the service was sporadic at best. Instead of a steady flow of finessed attention, I sat and watched many staff clear away a large section put together for a party that decided instead to dine upstairs. Meanwhile, I wondered when they'd take my order and get to serving it...  Portions.  I don't get it.  Since when are fine-dining portions meant to be so small when the price is mostly big? Well, it's one way to keep the peasants out, cos they tend to be really hungry!  And how is it that this has became standard practice? Dunno...  But I get it that we are to mincingy sip our wine, daintily attend to etiquette as we masticate through the pickings, and not peer around too much at other patrons as they politely attend to somewhat-sheepish servers quietly explaining the complexity of the offerings as if to make up for what's obviously missing: that this bit of nourishment that could easily fit on a small saucer was to be taken as a filling meal is ludicrous! Not at all great food, the whole affair was decidedly boring. Call me a low-life bourgeois if you want, but guests aren't to be teased into spending $100+ a head to leave satisfied, are we?  Looking around, I was not among champions of haute-couture at all, but just average cow-town folk out for a special dining experience. What a charade...  Would I return? Ah, but I can get a better meal with more clout in a less ostentatious upper-middle class setting where the FOOD is what impresses, and where there's no need to dine on airs and appearances!   I want a meal when I go out to eat!  I want it to delightfully 'assault my palate' and not gently stroke it as if the overture to a romantic comedy.  And after all, I can see sparrows drinking still water anywhere in the world.  Likely steer clear of this place, because there are better, far better."}
{"text":"It's so rare to find a great Italian restaurant that is just that - Italian. They do it well here. A simple menu of tasty treats from Italy.   I recommend the Risotto Pesto with cherry tomato and feta. Not over powering and very satisfying. You will leave full! If you do appetizers, you may want the half portion.   My lunch partner had the linguine and really enjoyed his meal. The service was amazing and not pushy. The ambience is charming. I think this place at night would be a romantic hideaway, but this was a business lunch and while being on the other side of the tracks, it's worth the 5 minute walk from 8 ave."}
{"text":"Bonterra has a unique and interesting italian menu. I tried their Prosciutto con Pera and Polpetti Di Vitello to start. The pears were sweet and paired well with the salted pork, so well that it felt like a tango inside my mouth. The venison meatballs were packed with voracious flavour, so much that I had to eat it with the Bonterra's exquisite in house bread. For the main course I had too half orders of pasta: the Carbonarra and the Amatriciana. The Carbonarra was...ok enough with the fancy writing. I blacked out, I remember my maw whirring away like a motorboat, plates were flying, utensils were being thrown like darts into the wall, babies were crying.  Also I was a bit concerned with the service this night as our server seemed a little disorganized and slow. It seemed like she had to serve a room full of raucous suits har-harring away in the other room. And who do I see strolling out? Mayor Nenshi, along with his secret league of Mayors, riding off to god knows where Mayors go to on a thursday night.   Someday...someday..."}
{"text":"Oily pasta, oily focaccia ,   Orchietti was over cooked and split  Buratta was excellent  Staff seemed rushed? It was a blizzard and only 20 or so guests with 5 floor staff ?  Not really welcoming to single diners"}
{"text":"Went to Bonterra based on all the favourable Yelp reviews. I have to say that I'm impressed with the garden patio and the pastas. Depending on which side you face, you can see the city skyline, with some of Calgary's taller buildings peeking out. The patio is heated and covered - much appreciated given our recent weather.  I tried both the boar carbonara and a chicken arugula pasta. The carbonara was buttery and rich tasting from the bacon. Not overly saucy, which I appreciated. The chicken pasta was light and flavourful, again, without a heavy cream sauce.   Service was great - and not just from our server. Water was replenished often. Another service put on the heater when he saw that I was getting cold. Other staff checked on us while we waited for our seat and near the end of the meal.  Husband was happy with the food, which means we will be back for date night. Prices are reasonable. We got in and out for about $100 for one big appy platter, two large pastas and one glass of wine."}
{"text":"I went here for a business lunch; the service was great, and they made me a vegan entrée that was not on the menu and customized it to my preferences. The server was great at telling me what I could and could not eat for appetizers and dessert and was knowledgeable about ingredients in all of the menu items. I struggle with finding business lunch meeting places that will cater to my vegan dietary needs, but still provide my colleagues with omnivorous options; Bonterra met the mark!"}
{"text":"Went there last Thursday, my wife chose seafood past and I had pizza from POSTO pizzeria (Yes, you can order from the restaurant besides). Great atmosphere and service, very friendly waitress.  Great and fresh ingredients, soft but tasty flavours."}
{"text":"Love, love, love Bonterra!  I have been for both lunch and dinner, and have never been disappointed.  My last visit was for dinner, and was fortunate to sit on the patio on a lovely summer evening.  Great service, great menu, great wine and great company - we had a blast and I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I Made a 2 month prior reservation for my Mother's Birthday on-line. It was quick and painless. When we arrived I informed our server that we had reservations, she immediately seated us (this was around 11:30am). My plan was to beat the lunch rush and hopefully get our apps and entrée on time.   I ordered the Sweet pea & Asparagus soup topped with truffle oil 8.5/10. My mother had the meatballs with spicy/chunky tomato sauce 6.5/10. For our main coarse I ordered plate of Gluten Free fettuccine and sauce... they gave me the same chunky sauce for the meatballs as they did for my main coarse. It was just... OK.... 5/10.  My mother had Manzo * five hour braised SCR beef short rib, celery root puree, roasted beets, she likes it 9/10 (sounds as good as it taste). When I got the bill I was expecting over $100 but instead it was only $65. Not bad for a fancy restaurant. But for me it was once in a life time, considering the menu is limited to my dietary needs. I got through the meal and survived. My mother enjoyed her lunch surprise. When I checked my watch it was almost 2 pm when leaving the place. So much for getting in & out quickly..."}
{"text":"Bonterra features delicious Italian food at the upper end of the culinary spectrum.  I had a quick Twitter exchange that led me to believe that their Taste of Calgary 2014 menu would be available gluten free but when I arrived, I was informed that that information was incorrect. While I don't think that it is fair to include that in my evaluation of the experience, I hope they become a little more synced between social media and their actual menu.  I started off the night with the olive plate and enjoyed the many different varieties of olives, many of which I had never had the pleasure of trying before. I was expecting the olives to have very strong tastes, but they were softer than I expected and actually varied vastly in taste.  Next I had a soup that was a leek base with smoked salmon and other delicious ingredients (it appears their menu has changed since I last visited, so I can't look it up). I remember being very impressed by the soup overall.   The pasta I chose had lamb and was served on gluten free pasta. The whole dish was quite impressive and the gluten free pasta held up well without taking over the taste of the dish.   For dessert I had the gluten free almond cake. It was coated with chocolate and served with a red wine soaked pear. I found the cake to be very good and a huge portion (great for sharing). I would definitely order it again when I revisit.  If you love Italian and want to splurge on some delicious food, Bonterra's for you."}
{"text":"Had the Rib Eye steak here. Extremely good. The Cornish Hen my friend had was very small, actually too small. Left him hungry after the meal. Wine selection could be more extensive and outside of just Italian blends. Otherwise, still a very nice experience."}
{"text":"After working in the area off and on for 5 years I finally made a point to go for lunch and am glad that I did. When we finish a big project at work, my co-worker and I go out for a celebration and because it has been so cold we wanted to go somewhere fairly close to the office..... Enter Bonterra!  We made a reservation for 11:45 and arrived right on time. We went in through the door on 8th Street (which we though to be the entrance) and waited, and waited.....  Several employees made eye contact with us but it was a good 5 minutes before any of them greeted us. It appeared that other people were coming in through another door but it am not certain where. It was awkward standing at the door for so long but what can ya do?   Once we were seated our server came to tell us the specials and see what we wanted to drink. We both went with a glass of the house red and started reviewing the lunch menu. Our wine came quickly and I have to say it was wonderful! Often the \"house\" selection isn't great but in this case we were both happy.... Too bad neither of us remember what it was. For lunch I chose the Tagliatelle with Clams (Tagliatelle con Vongole) and my friend ordered the Pumpkin Ravioli. While we waited for our entrees we tried the fresh focaccia bread with their olive oil dip and it was great. The bread was so fluffy! Our meals were served quickly and were presented beautifully. My  friend enjoyed hers and it looked great. Mine had a lot of clams (in shells) and a light, broth-like sauce. It tasted wonderful with the exception of two clams that almost seemed undercooked. The shells were totally open but they were very strong and too soft or maybe slimy. Seafood in Alberta is less fresh than I am used to being from the coast so I won't dwell on those two clams. At the end of the meal we were both happy and full.  Overall it was delicious but pricy for lunch. I will go back at some point but will likely hit some of the other places on my wish list before returning."}
{"text":"Date night! Used some pull, but we managed to get a seat on the patio.  Service was slow. We sometimes had to flag down the server, but we were in no rush.   The food was beautiful. We nibbled on the bread 'sticks' and were offered some fresh focaccia. The olive tapenade was delicious. We ordered a tuna/sardine app. Delicious and fresh. I had the veal. Seasoning was perfect. My bf ordered the duck breast. I found it a bit bland, but he loved it. Of course some espresso and dessert to finish it off. We had the chocolate cake, but wished we'd had the tiramisu.  Be prepared to be there a while. 3 hours had passed while we nibbled, chatted and sipped wine. Date night success!!"}
{"text":"Everything is so Delicious! Try the Linguine Carbonara & Bruschetta here! ....Mmmm! The atmosphere is WONDERFUL, almost soft romantic! The PATIO is one of Calgary's best kept SECRETS! It will definitely take you away from the hustle and bustle! Relax and ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Great front desk people to greet us during our visit.  Nice surroundings but that's where the good points stop.  The waitress we had was indifferent bordering on rude---when we could find her.   Once we were in the door, staff seemed busy with everyone else.  Food is good but not great. There are some friends who swear by this place so I will return with them.  Will not return on my own."}
{"text":"Bonterra has one of the best patios in Calgary, so summer dining here is a treat if you can manage to get an outdoor table. On a Monday evening in late August, it was busy, always a good sign. We started with the Formaggi 5-cheese platter, an assortment of hard and soft cheeses including a not too pungent gorgonzola, paired with a half litre of Chiarlo Gavi, a very pleasant white that also nicely rounded out the crab risotto and a truly luscious fettucine gamberi (the pasta was perfectly al dente and the prawns were cooked just right). Desserts: a panna cotta and a tiramisu, both executed very well. Service was attentive and prompt without being intrusive. We love this place, and will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Dinner tonight with friends to catch up and Bonterra was a pretty good place to do so. Seemingly busy for a Sunday evening. We were seated promptly and our server was by quickly to offer drinks and update us on menu items added and ones that were unavailable.  The drinks menu at Bonterra is on an IPad which makes scrolling around simple and adds features such as a history on the winery as well as possible food pairings - unique.  Mains ordered include: ravioli, beef cheeks, carbonara and pasta. All arrived promptly and seemed as described on the menu. I had the calamari that was very good due to Bonterra's interpretation - not breaded nor deep fried but mixed with baby arugula, almonds and whole chillies - yum! Dessert was a blood orange sorbet that had a real punch to the flavour and was refreshing after various flavours in the apps and mains.  Overall, a good place to eat with a nice atmosphere to chat and have a few laughs. The server was attentive as was required and he made some good wine recommendations.  Parking behind Bonterra is free and well lit!"}
{"text":"NOM NOM NOM.   I love, love, love Bonaterra. I've been hearing wonderful things for years, but have not yet had the chance to pay a visit, so I was very happy when we paid a visit for dinner for a small holiday celebration. I was glad we made a reservation, because the place was packed!  Even though it looks tiny on the outside, the space opens up on the inside. It is beautifully designed, and even though the tables are quite close together it feels like there is so much space. It felt like being in an Italian Piazza, which was just thrilling.  The service was excellent - we were constantly being checked on. We ordered a bottle of wine to start, and then a couple appies, the standout of which was the chickpea fries which came with a mayo.  My entree was the Pizza con frutti di mare, with scallops and shrimps and peccorino cheese. It was deluxe: very delicious, the flavours complimented each other so well. The other standout was the fettucine a la vongole, which was rich and delicious. The ricotta ravioli was tasty but a bit lacking in flavour. You could taste the care and preparation of the dishes. I felt like I was going to explode. Like the fat man in the meaning of life, because I was so, so full. But then the dessert menu came.  We finished up with a earl grey panna cotta to share. It was like eating delicious, creamy heaven clouds. It was so good. I was not a fan of the accompanying polenta shortbread, but that panna cotta is seriously in my dreams. As I said before, I was ready to burst, but I still shoveled down more of my share of that panna cotta. We had some lovely conversation, but my first paragraph basically summarizes my thoughts on Bonterra."}
{"text":"HOW DID I NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS LITTLE GEM?!  My girlfriend and I were planning to head down to Beerfest on Saturday evening, but one too many glasses of wine later we opted to grab a bite instead. She suggested Bonterra, as it's right around the corner from her place. She called and got us a table, impressive seeing as how it was 8PM on Saturday night! Fast forward 5 minutes, and we're at the door.  This is one of those places that does not look like much on the outside, but inside is a whole other story! The place was bumpin. I love the decor and the high ceilings. It was perfect. We were lucky enough to snag a table on the GORGEOUS patio. My gawd, again - how did I not know about this place? It's absolutely beautiful. Hanging heat lamps ensure you're comfortable, even on a slightly chilly night. High walls, rustic wood fireplaces, and subtle lighting make you feel like you're in a whole other world. I truly felt like I was back in Italy and I loved it. Super romantic, it would make a great date night spot.  I wont comment on the prices, because we were 2 bottles of wine deep so I knew it wouldn't be a cheap night. I do know that the wine was on the expensive side, but that's typical for any nice restaurant in Calgary. I honestly don't even know if I looked at the bill so I couldn't tell you but everything we had was fabulous. The oysters = amazing. I loved the 3 different types of mignonette and the fresh horseradish. We also ordered the caprese salad and the risotto. Both were excellent, and with the fresh bread at the table, more than enough to fill us up. Our waiter was so attentive, never allowing our glasses to be empty, and it was lovely to sit and chat, drink wine, and never feel rushed. In fact, we were one of the last tables in the place at the end of the night.   I absolutely loved my experience here and I cannot wait to bring my boyfriend back!"}
{"text":"Bonterra is a charming Italian restaurant that I would definitely visit again. Make sure you make a reservation; it's busy!  We sat in the upper section which had great ambiance. The beet salad was phenomenal, and the potato soup was good, with a spicy twist to it. We ordered the pumpkin ravioli, which tasted like dinner and dessert all in one, and the lasagna which was chock full of meat and a really good size. Needless to say we were both stuffed after eating!"}
{"text":"my wife, myself and another couple had dinner at bonterra Saturday nite. what a disappointment . we ordered the penne frigate and found it mediocre at best. the pasta was dry and tough as if it had sat in the open air for too long. this restaurant is my favorite so it gets one more chance. I hope this was just an anomaly."}
{"text":"Good service, beautiful old building, but super loud, ask to go upstairs if you're looking for something quieter Had a nice Ripasso for 45,   Meals were extremely tasty, but portion size was definitely on the smaller side  Linguini vongole was delicious, lots of clams , but strangely little pasta.  Bread while waiting would have been nice to help with small portion size.  Gorgeous patio outside."}
{"text":"I have a dined at Bonterra several times and have never had a bad experience. The service is always top notch and the management team will go above and beyond to ensure you enjoy the experience. As for the food, not to sound repetitive, I often will try something different there as I have enjoyed all my meals. At most restaurants, I have a couple of favourites I stay with, not here. I typically try something new. However, I always order the Calamari. That is a must."}
{"text":"I love Bonterra it is one of my favourite Italian restaurants in town. And that is where my review stops! I take offence to an establishment PRE-setting the tip options on the card machine to 18%+ ( not that one can not change it ... but it basically says what you think of your clients ... push overs !) Once that is rectified ...I may reconsider revisiting and re-reviewing"}
{"text":"The food is excellent although it should be at the price.  The waiter, Jeremy I think was his name, was excellent. He was at the table enough for good service, but not so much as to be annoying.  The beef they served was hormone and steroid free which is important to me personally.   The meals were at a high end price, but perfectly cooked and plated. The wine is overpriced in my opinion. There were bottles I know I can buy for $20 at the store being sold for $60 on the wine list. That markup is too steep and that's the only reason I'm not giving 5 stars."}
{"text":"I find this restaurant to be quite deceiving when it comes to size. Just based on the exterior of the restaurant you wouldn't think it would be a big restaurant. You will be pleasantly surprised! Its ambiance is beautiful and you do feel a sense of culture upon entering. Not to mention the patio area, which is beautifully decorated and absolutely perfect for a private function. We attended a wedding there during the summer and it was beautiful.   The food was very tasty and overall very filling! The wine selection, along with the service was great! I will definitely be back and recommend this restaurant for family dinners along with dates."}
{"text":"Great place!!.. The service here is very very good!!.. The food is great too!!.. I had a risotto and it was delicious!!.. The wine was fine... The desserts were great too!!.. I had the white chocolate cheese cake, and I loved it... Definitely a place to go back!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food and good service @ Bonterra.  We had our office Christmas lunch here and there was lots of food!!  We had 4 platters of appetizers - cheese and olives, anitpasto, shrimp and pancetta and bruscetta.  Focacia bread was handed out as well.  Try it with that oil and garlic.   It was tasty!  Then our meal was a prixe fixe meal - one appy, one entree and one dessert.  I ordered the Spinach salad with the honeydew; it came with portabello mushroom.  For my entree, I had the special beef entree with gorgonzola.  For my dessert, the mocha chocolate cake with poached pear.  Scrumptious!  Ended my meal with a decaf cappucinno.  I tried some of my colleagues' food - calamari is really, really good!!"}
{"text":"The menu, wine list, and service are fantastic. I just moved to Calgary and I choose Bonterra's as my first fine dining experience. And what a great choice that was. My server Jeremy was very welcoming and he had a great sense of humour. Such a great place. Definitely going back.   My only suggestion would be for the restaurant to make the upstairs as atmospheric and as comfortable as the main level. And improve the acoustics upstairs.  p.s. Great cooks here."}
{"text":"Love the energy - ambiance - service - wine list - ... and then food! 2 of us went for lunch and enjoy a superb glass of wine (servers choice) to go with my salad and friends carbonara - SO good!"}
{"text":"What an adorable entryway..  Just like an Italian backyard, you enter through a magestic gate through a beautiful patio area.  We didn't make a reservation thinking that on a week night we'd have no issues getting a table!   False.   We ended up at the bar as there were no tables available.  The bar was a really unique eating experience, made better due to the fact the bartender was super friendly and showed a sincere passion for the drinks and food.  We had the Porto Platter which is a beautiful charcuterie plate with unique flavours.  For example there was a variety of salamis with buffalo mozzarella, and then prosciutto with pears, gorgonzola, and walnuts.   Beautiful taste combinations.  We also had the bison carpaccio which came with caper berries (yes, I had no idea such a thing existed until that point) and these crazy chips that were described to us as a hybrid potato artichoke chip.   What a fabulous combination of the soft meat, crunchy chip, arugula, and the saltiness from the caper berries.     For dessert we tried the pumpkin spice cake and it was just as amazing.  We had a wonderful experience and would highly rec commend you go."}
