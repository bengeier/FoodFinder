{"text":"Very tasty quick stop. Carne asada tacos were delicious. Portion sizes were huge, so go there hungry."}
{"text":"Not sure if this place is a hidden little secret- but it feels like one! With so many new restaurants popping up, don't overlook Julio's Too. It's tried and true authentic Mexican food. No frills just good quality food. I recommend that chicken taco bowls!"}
{"text":"mmmmmm, I love Julio's Too. Sometimes just the a la carte dishes are plenty for lunch, but the lunch and dinner specials are a great price and oh, so good."}
{"text":"I've been an on and off patron of this establishment for a few years now. It became a family tradition to order take-out for get togethers.

Never eaten at this location, just take-out. I usually stuck with a beef chimi and was pretty satisfied. It comes with rice and beans, plus you get the chips and salsa, so I feel that the price is a fairly decent value.

This past week we went on a Julio's kick so I tried something new. First, the green chili pork chimi. Yum! Instantly replaced the beef in my mind.

Tonight, I tried the pollo magnifico.... Wow. How did I never look at this section on the menu? Loved it. Basically a fundido chimi, lives up to its name! Also, the nachos supreme were quite yummy but got pretty soggy in the take-out container."}
{"text":"This place kills it the service is dope. The food is exactly what you when you're out looking for that drunchies fix or when just plan hungry."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a quick bite.  Friendly, affordable and perhaps my favorite enchilada sauce in town.   Great take out and quick service without sacrificing flavor or quality."}
{"text":"Last time I was in Scottsdale was December and I really didn't have a chance to try a good local spot. This time I made sure to do just that. 

Based solely on Yelp reviewers we decided to try this place. Even though its a mexican eatery, something about it seemed different. It was. 

I had the Lunch Pollo Magnifico that was recommended by the nice lady taking orders. I was hesitant because of the jalape√±o sour cream they put on it. I was wrong and that ended up being the piece that brought everything together. This fried burrito was amazing! I'm normally not a fan of chicken in burritos because it always seems dry to me. Not here. The chicken was seasoned and very tender. 

If you are in the area and you are able to find a parking spot in their tiny lot, I would recommend stopping here. 

One star removed due to the mild salsa tasting like it came from a jar (not from new york city...)"}
{"text":"I feel like this would be great...if I were drunk.  My tostada was buried under a mountain of shredded cheeze and lettuce. I could barely taste what I was eating.  I'll give it 3 stars for now and decide on a + or - rating when I come back next....maybe I'll be drunk by then, the W pool party IS next door.  Perhaps that is where most of these possitive reviews are coming from... Drunk people leaving the W."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place doesn't have 5 stars???!!!  

The Mini Chimis are wonderful with the cream cheese Jalapeno dip.  
Tacos are always right on. 
And who can resist the $2.50 Margaritas???
Staff is always helpful. 
Only thing I would change is the staff should check on you if you need more chips and salsa :)"}
{"text":"Everything else in Scottsdale is kinda douchey...this place is great! Good food, good beer, affordable, and most importantly...character."}
{"text":"Very average and generic food. Cheap and fast but honestly qdoba is better and right down the street. I was really looking forward to this place based on some friend's recommendations but at the end of the day it was not superclean cheap Mexican food. They also forgot half of my order for takeout. So I ended up with a couple of rolled tacos despite paying for a platter."}
{"text":"Great for a quickie lunch.  I've never been to the restaurant side, just the takeout one.  The flautas are delicious even though I avoid the beans and the rice is usually kind of dry.  The beef tacos are good and the little chip/salsa bar is a nice touch.  I have yet to try everything, but so far it's a good little place to hit in a pinch."}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes to get our food.  This is counter service and it was 7pm on a Thursday, so in my opinion, that's crazy.  It wasn't even busy, either.  Once we got our food (I got the chicken burrito with a side of beans) it was rather bland.  My hubby got a tamale, which was pretty much all masa and no beef.  Only good part of this restaurant was the salsa."}
{"text":"One of my favorites. The crispy chicken tacos are overstuffed with meat,lettuce,cheese and always filling. The prices are reasonable for what you get. Also like Julios g  too next door for quick take out  or \"no Tip\" casual meal. Self serve chips and mild chunky salsa  are terrific."}
{"text":"Gross. The spanish rice is gross - bland with what appears to be canned mixed vegetables in it. The ground beef in their beef taco salad is like finally ground cat meat = low quality. 

Just low quality food that most white people, who are none the wiser as to what comprises good Mexican/Tex Mex food,  will eat. 

Today I found bug legs in my salad lettuce...later after I had left the restaurant and was munching on leftovers. 

Prices are reasonable and food is served quickly. The tall dark stocky dude that is always in there when I come in on weekdays during is not personable and kind of a an ass."}
{"text":"Lunch specials are a good bang for your buck! The quality of food is very good for the price. A coworker recommended it and I am so happy they did.  Their machaca is very flavorful and delish! As mentioned before be prepared for a food coma."}
{"text":"My new all time favorite go-to Mexican food restaurant. This place is amazing, authentic and delicious, I have been raving about it to my friends constantly. You get exactly what you pay for and more. The prices are outstanding and they even throw in complimentary guac and chips & salsa (which is awesome)! I recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Ordered 2 flautas lunch special. Both the chicken and beef were great. Chips and salsa were stellar! Would Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"A family friend talked about this place all the time, so my friend and I finally went when we were in the area. It was great! Even though most places do this, I love that free chips come with your meal!! It was almost overwhelming because they have a very large menu, but I just got a bean and cheese burrito and I thought it was great! I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I have been to Julio's too multiple time as it is a very dependable, always tasty spot satisfy my cravings for Mexican food. However, last night my boyfriend ordered a carnitas big burrito enchilada style and it was hands down THE BEST Mexican food I have had in my 4 years in the valley. The carnitas meat was out of this world. I don't know how they did it but I hope they keep doing it again and again and again. I had the spinach and chicken enchiladas which were no doubt delicious, but after I tasted the carnitas nothing could compare."}
{"text":"How is it that I am the first to review this place? It is a classic, and it is always busy! Go figure? 

Julio's Too is the take-out version of it's big brother Julio G's, the menus are the same but the prices are sure not! Julio's Too is very reasonably priced, and offers the same quality of food as the main restaurant. The lunch specials are amazing, with most being around just $6.00!! They too have my beloved Jalapeno Cream Cheese, and I usually end up ordering a half-pint to take home with me. 

I love the flautas, green chile burritos, shredded beef tacos and the mini chimis. Their salsa is very addicting, I just wish that they gave you more with your take-out order. The only flaw I find with Julio's Too is the beans. I am a bean connoisseur, and their beans just do not quite stack up to the others out there. They are just lacking that special something. When I have a craving for Mexican food, I usually lean towards Julio's because it is close to home, fast and cheap, but sometimes when I am really in the mood for some good beans, I have to go somewhere else with better beans! 

But even with the questionable beans, I am still there quite frequently."}
{"text":"Went the first time and it was gross!! The server had a attitude. The only reason for 2 stars was for the nice lady who dropped off the chips and salsa. Salsa was bland and tasted bad/old. The ground beef and shredded beef tacos were a light brown color... Never seen meat look that color. Taste was even worse than it looked bad and texture was huge chunks.. Beans and rice tasted like they were cooked in old fat and sitting for days. Do not waste any money in going here!!!"}
{"text":"Mexican Restaurant. This is a hidden gem.  They have the best take out for Mexican Food.  A must try."}
{"text":"I eat here every weekend, I work right across  the street and go in about 15 or 20 minutes before they close. They are always nice to me and thank me for coming in. Much appreciated"}
{"text":"Tried the chicken tacos.  i have also ordered a combo of a cheese enchilada, relleno, and a beef taco.  All were delicious.  Best Mexican I have had in Old Town."}
{"text":"Went here for my lunch break and my experience was actually pretty good. I had a carne asada burrito and it was great...they didn't skimp on the meat like some chains do! The chips and salsa wasn't the best, but edible. Service was good...fast and friendly. It was packed and got even busier as we ate our food. One thing I did like...although not a big Pepsi fan, they had bottled Pepsi from Mexico, which is always tasty with Mexican food. Prices were about average. I'll be back for another burrito. I'd go here over their competitor down the street."}
{"text":"This was quick and convenient.  And..... it was quick and convenient.

I ordered their fish taco plate and ended up biting into what tasted like a salt taco!  Yuck!  I thought it was just one spot on the fish, but my second taco was just as salty.

My friend had a chicken quesadilla that was equally unpleasant.

Unfortunately, the \"serve yourself\" chips and salsa could not make up for our disappointing entrees.  :("}
{"text":"I've been going to Julio's since I was born. It's a family favorite. When Julio G's closed, I literally cried but Julio Too's keeps my cravings in line. The salsa is perfection. Hands down my favorite. The enchilada sauce I could drink. The mini chimis are addicting. I personally love their appetizer platter that has a little bit of everything because I can never decide on just one thing. The service is so genuine and kind. It's all around one of the best Mexican food restaurants in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a casual, but quality Mexican food restaurant to order takeout from that is as good as the Carambas I used to live by. And I think I found it!

The other night, we ordered dinner to go from here and I was pleasantly surprised.

The Mini Chimis with Jalapeno cream cheese were just what I was hoping for.

Can't wait to try more things here!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in my new neighborhood! The bar tenders are always smiling and upbeat and the serving staff is prompt and friendly! I love the food and the margaritas!!! I will always call that my get away!"}
{"text":"The food is GREAT, in my experience.

I'm sure, you'll agree, that FOUL MOUTHED ..... reviewer Collin S.
.......IS A WANNABE RAPER.

Checkout the Language in this review, and all of his reviews.

Glad your wheels were towed."}
{"text":"AWFUL! All I can say. HORRIBLE service for 1 and the food is nothing special and it's over priced!"}
{"text":"Love this place, a friend showed it to me one night and have fallen in love with it ever since.  Great salsa with there chips.  The place has been recently remodeled and it looks great.  Our waiter knew the menu well and was friendly.  Really refreshing open air place unlike other Mexican restaurants.  

Went with my family recently and they loved it, good, efficient service.  No waiting to be seated."}
{"text":"I have eaten at the sit down Julio G's on a number of occasions.  We have friends who really like their food, frankly it is good, but not top tier.  Decent, but nothing worth driving past other restaurants though the service has always been good.

Today my wife and I had the misfortune  of stopping  by Julio's Too.  We figured, only a wall separates them, likely the same food.  Not so much.  While the taco's were good, we made two mistakes, ordering the green chili pork chimichanga and engaging the young lady who was working the cash register.  

Let's say the chimichanga was not like any other chimichanga I have had before and not in a good way.  It did not have a nice crisp, golden exterior, largely it was a grey ball of tortilla was swimming in beans and rice.  When I asked the young lady working the cash register she said, \"oh that is what our Chimichanga's are like\".  Doughy balls of uncooked tortilla?  She grudgingly agreed to cook a new one for us.  

Amazingly, the next chimichanga she brought was a lovely golden color, like every other chimichanga I have eaten.  Though even after bringing it, she said the first one had been deep fried.   Let it go, bring my new chimichanga and go away.  Please.

Tip when ordering at Julio's Too,  the taco's are okay, but pass on the green chili chimichanga with a side of attitude from the employees."}
{"text":"I like that for a lunch special margarita, I got the extra \"boost\" I needed at the careful curation and handling of Julio's Too Employee Who Looks Like a Phoenix Musician But I'm Not Sure Which Band; however, I lost my head high about this place knowing that if you call in to order beforehand, you may just be placed on hold indefinitely by said Julio's Too Band Employee Dude. Anyway, food was cheap, margs were real, and I probably smell like enchilada sauce, but I Don't Care. The neon lights in the interior decor had me befuddled. Order the cheese enchis if you decide to go here despite my review."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Couldn't believe the amount of food for the price.  The green chili pork was amazing and the fajita burrito was bomb.  Wish I lived closer so I could come more often.  I will probably be back in the morning for a breakfast burrito!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in the country. You can bet they are cookin up some of the best green corn tamales a mouth can taste. There's nothing like the pollo magnifico, it's the best plate around. If you think you've had good food before... Think again. The mini chimi's are incredible. 

The staff is so good to their customers. Go in and just have a conversation with them. You'll see. They love their customers. Steve, the owners son is a total hottie. Have some free chips and salsa. I can sit there and eat them all day. 

Seriously go here if you're looking for good mex food. Prices are amazing and so is the food. I've never had anything I didn't like from their menu, and I've tried so many different things."}
{"text":"Wow! This place was great! I had 2 carne asada tacos. Plenty of food. I audio had chips and salsa. Couldn't finish it all. .....but it was hard to stop. I would definitely come back when I'm in town. The people working they day were super nice too! Nice to sit outside."}
{"text":"I work pretty close to this place and we order take out quite a bit. The food is always great and they always get our order right, which seems to be quite rare nowadays at a lot of other places. The lunch menu has good food for good prices and makes it very convenient to place to-go orders for my work (2-5 orders). Highly recommended if you are looking for great mexican food."}
{"text":"I'm only giving a 2 star because our waitress was great & helpful, very courteous. 

As for the food, I would eat Taco Bell before this place. Their \"white Baja sauce\", is whipped cream cheese with a tiny bit of jalape√±o. Tasted like butter. 

My husband got minis & more. They were COVERED in a terrible thick layer of cheese, which he took off, then come to find out they drenched it in the whipped cream cheese sauce. 
Their red chili beef was alright, but had hardly any favor. 

To each their own, I guess!! I will stick to Macayos."}
{"text":"Best green corn tamales in Arizona.  Combos are magnificent with many choices. Have been a customer for more than 25 years.  Gets better and better!"}
{"text":"Yummy, yummy, yummy!  I had crispy, greasy, packed with meat tacos just like I like `em.  The beans and rice were great and the chips are the thinnest, most crispy delights I've had in a long time!
The staff was super nice too.
This place is super casual and good."}
{"text":"I've driven past before. Finally tried it a couple weeks ago. Not your typical scottsdale joint. Good prices. The staff are so sweet. The food is amazing. I've gotten the tamales, chicken tacos, burrito, beans and rice. All were delicious! They are speedy when ordering to dine in or to go. Definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"Holy crapoli this place is good. I could eat here a couple times a week and be perfectly content! We went in yesterday and got the mini chimichangas and some queso/chips. Both were great portions, extremely well priced and delicious! The salsa is fresh and somewhat sweet- almost as sweet and helpful as the employees! I definitely had leftovers and they are delicious even the next day! Can't wait to come back and try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Found this place near Old Town!  Great food and service.  Will be back!  Had their enchiladas and tallas plate.  Not being from the area they gave good suggestions"}
{"text":"Julio's is great.  Maybe it's just the nostalgia from my college days at ASU, where I would eat at the Julio's near campus (now closed) on a weekly basis.  But I still go out of my way to come to the Scottsdale Julio's to eat, because I really like the food.

Their portions are huge.  I love their tacos, tamales, tostados, and enchiladas.  And their salsa is amazing,  So fresh and tasty! 

I hope this place stays open, because it's one of the few places where you can get good Mexican take out.  If only I lived closer."}
{"text":"4 stars so yes,  \"I'm a fan\"...but not necessarily because the entrees were anything great (they were just \"ok\").

No, I love this place because whenever my girls and I were picking up carryout, the staffers would let us (or at least they knew better than to try and stop us?) fill up 64oz Big Gulp cups with salsa.

MMMMmmmm good.  

Notice I said it was the girls and I.  Don't eat this much salsa if you're planning on kissing anyone in the following 48-72 hours...."}
{"text":"Juilo's is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Scottsdale. Does not have the best or largest dining area but we can usually find a place outside on the patio. Food is always delicious and portions are large and plentiful especially for the price. I would highly recommend for anyone looking for some good cheap Mexican."}
{"text":"I love the mini chimis here!  They are the best!  The food on its own gets five stars.  They could be a little more generous with their salsa, but other than that, this place is wonderful.  :)"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ate there last weekend around 8:45pm and around 9:15 or so, we walked next door to the W hotel to look at the car club lamborghinis that they had parked in front, we were gone for about 30 minutes or so and returned around 9:45 and my truck had been towed, I had to pay over $20 for a taxi to get home and then drive all the way across town to pick up my truck the next morning and had to pay another $75 to retrieve it! I was extra angry, however after speaking to the manager, Carlos, and having him investigate whether or not I actually ate there he was still reluctant to refund me the $75 dollars for the tow. Luckily, I recorded the entire conversation I had with the Julios workers on my cell phone and after explaining that if he would not refund me, I would be posting the discriminatory videos to YouTube right away, he finally gave me my $75 back. Needless to say, if you go here make sure not to park in their parking lot and also this place sucks even though they refunded me as it took over a week of dispute and too much effort for them to right their wrong!"}
{"text":"We love this cute little restaurant! Delicious and affordable Mexican food with plenty of options. They have all the deliciously fried and cheesy traditional Mexican fare and some tasty salads for when I want a healthier meal. The employees are also extremely accommodating and polite!"}
{"text":"Good, close to work, and cheap!

I'd recommend if you're in the area for a quick lunch. It's tight quarters inside the restaurant so I find takeout to be the best (work is close so it's easy to eat in the office).

Overall, I'd definitely recommend. I've only ordered lunch which is very reasonably priced and very, very filling!"}
{"text":"Who's Julio?
   Well, whoever he is, he does good, simple, Mexican food. They have a full menu of Mexican fare and the price can't be beat for lunch. Bottled beer as well as margaritas are available. It is a nice touch for a limited service restaurant. The decor is a little out dated but not distracting. There is also a nice dining patio out front.
  I stopped in for for lunch by myself (don't tell the Blonde) and ordered a taco salad. This came with a side of chips and salsa. The mild salsa was had well developed flavor with out being heavy on tomatoes. The house fried corn chips were light, crunchy and not greasy.
   The taco salad shell was slightly over cooked and there were a few carrots in the salad mix. I suspect they are using a prepackaged salad mix. I ordered my taco salad with shredded beef. It was lightly seasoned letting the flavor of the slow cooked beef shine through. The taco salad was topped with a generous amount of sour cream and guacamole. 
   The staff was very helpful and courteous. They are attentive to the dining room and quickly replaced the Dr. Pepper when it ran out, delivered meals quickly and accurately, and offered to refill chips and salsa. Overall, a nice place for an quick inexpensive meal. They have plenty of off street parking, too.

Warm Fuzzies (the good stuff)
-Clean inviting building.
-Pleasant attentive staff
-Generous portions.
-Beer and Margaritas.
-Off street parking (this is huge considering the location).

Cold Baldies (the not so good stuff)
-Dated decor.
-possibly too quiet (I don't remember any background music)."}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch as we wanted to try a new Mexican place since we are still desperately looking for our go to Mexican restaurant.

We decided beforehand if the food wasn't going to be good, we would have back up and eat at the W Hotel at Sushi Roku. If you didn't know this, the W Hotel is right across the way.

First and foremost the parking is tight here so whether you're eating inside or outside on the small patio know that you'll have to wait around until someone leaves the lot or park around the corner if you want to be walking distance to your car.

As soon as we walked in were greeted by a nice young girl. She was friendly and directed us towards the lunch menu which was decently priced. As usual, we're still looking for a Mexican restaurant to replace our fave and legendary taco place in Santa Fe, New Mexico called the El Parasol, so we ordered the shredded beef tacos.

The order came with free chips and salsa. The salsa was available in both hot and mild. The food came out on paper plates within 10 minutes of ordering. The food was lukewarm. Beans and rice not hot at all and the taco, while it looked robust, tasted like it was just microwaved. Surprisingly though the taco was filled nicely to the rim with lettuce, cheese, and the shredded beef.

As soon as we took a bite of the (hard shelled) taco we could taste that the taco meat was soft and seasoned nicely but the taco shell was very stiff almost sharp and remember no warmth. The texture and taste was unbalanced. You had soft meat that was enveloped by a shell which to the taste was lukewarm.

Hungry after a 30 minute drive to this restaurant, we both ate the tacos as they were edible and only took 2-3 bites of the rice and beans (since they both were lukewarm in temperature).

Since we were still hungry and on the other side of town there was no turning back...thinking maybe we ordered the wrong thing here and still hungry, we decided to give it another try and order one beef tamale. The tamale was over $5.00. Unlike our lunch combo plates our one tamale took awhile to serve. In fact it was almost 15 minutes before it came out.

When the tamale finally came to our table, we both forked it and each took a bite. We were surprised that the tamale came out hotter then any of the other food we got there. As soon as both swallowed we said the same thing...

The tamale was too salty to eat any further.

Then my husband suggests that maybe it's just the sauce. Or just the meat or just the tamale skin that is salty. Since it was my idea I guess I was going to be the guinea pig. After two bites, I realized that every part of the tamale was over salted and I stopped eating. My husband hates salty food so our meal was officially over. Luckily, Happy Hour was starting at Sushi Roku, our back up place.

While we got good service from the staff and the prices are decent, it's safe to say that we have yet found our go to Mexican place in Arizona."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican Food in the area. Great staff, fresh food and unlimited chips & salsa. A staple in our family! Hard to go wrong here"}
{"text":"Alllllways a good place for gringo Mexican food.  
$2.50 margs combined with cheese enchiladas and crispy shredded beef tacos!  Perfect combo for a Saturday."}
{"text":"Had a late lunch at Julio's Too the other day.  Food was absolutely fine, and washed itself down nicely with a Mexican beer I'd never heard of before from the fridge.

Nothing outstanding, but nothing to complain about.  If I was walking past hungry, I'd certainly go back; would I go far out of my way?  Probably not.  Would I take my wife?  Yes.  A hot date?  Probably not.  Does it do what it set out to do - decent Mexican food in a diner setting?  Certainly does."}
{"text":"This is our go to lunch spot when I visit my sister.  It is one of the best fast mexican food places around.  They have great salsa, queso, and chips.  

Try:
- Queso
- Spinach Enchiladas
- Tacos

The inside is kinda small but they have a good sized patio to sit outside."}
{"text":"I was waiting in a long line for a concert and was feeling antsy. I wandered into Julio's Too looking for a bathroom, but I was distracted by all the delicious smells. I couldn't resist so I ordered one soft beef taco. It was only $3 and they also gave me a free bag of fresh piping hot chips and asked me what type of salsa I wanted. They loaded my bag with 3 cups of mild salsa, chips, and the beef taco. I lived in San Diego for 4 years and found the quality to be pretty authentic. It also helped make the line go faster as I munched away on my feastings."}
{"text":"Came here as some friends wanted to bring me here as I've never been before. 

The staff was very nice and were always there if you needed them. They have a wide variety of food to chose from which is great! The chips and salsa are good as well as their guacamole is outta this world. 

The quality and quantity of food was excellent! I'll be visiting here more!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  The lunch specials cannot be beat and everything comes with free chips and salsa."}
{"text":"This is an amazing little place off is Scottsdale Road. Parking lot can be hard to navigate and you may have trouble finding a space. Parking on the street is usually easier. The staff is always friendly. Food is delicious. I often order the mini chimi, chicken enchiladas, spinach enchiladas or beef tacos. Salsa is very good!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places where you go by default.

It's late. Or it's lunch. Nothing is nearby. Very few things are open. Julio's is right there. It's cheap. Why the hell not?

This place is pretty damn solid. 

It's unhealthy. It's delicious. It's the perfect \"after party\" food. Catch my 
drift?

Service can be a little slow, but whatevs."}
{"text":"Best Mexican take out...its fast and delish. There prices are a little all over the place, but overall it's a good value, when you get the lunch specials or the 2 or 3 item combos. The fajita quesadilla with either chicken or Carne asada is to die for and comes with sour cream, pico de gallo and guacamole which is definitely my go to meal there! My husband loves the 3 item combo (which is always enough food to feed too grown men) with the green corn tamale and (he gets two) chili rellenos. Yum! You get chips and salsa with every order, even to go and they are generous with their salsa! Other then the fact that I am not crazy about eating inside and sometimes if you order no beans you get them anyway...Your food is at least stove hot and made to order. I have nothing bad to say about this place! only that I think we eat there or take home food from there way to often..."}
{"text":"Good, cheap, and fast!. This is a place to go when you're craving Mexican food but don't want to spend Scottsdale type of money. My understanding is that its owned by one of the members of the Garcia's family, but unlike the restaurants which were sold by the family to a franchise chain, this place is still a local operation, much like Garcia's de las Avenidas at 35th Avenue and Encanto. It's basic, traditional, Mexican food that is homemade and tastes great."}
{"text":"This place is great. The service was amazing - the guy behind the counter was super helpful and seemed genuinely interested in how my day was going. The food was some of the best I've had - the red beef tamale is worth it if you're a fan of tamales!"}
{"text":"My new favorite Mexican food place to eat cheese enchiladas!! Too bad they are all the way in Arizona...but the food here is so good! Thank you to the lady working at the Fiesta Bowl Museum for suggesting this place to eat lunch at! She said this is her and her grandson's favorite Mexican food place, that even while eating at another Mexican place he said that he liked this place better. The unlimited warm chips and salsa is just a bonus to what this place has to offer. We ordered cheese enchiladas, beef tacos, carne asade tacos, flautas, and a tamale. It was simply delicious!! This would be the first place I come to when I visit Arizona again."}
{"text":"The BEST! I considers myself a picky eater. Every item I've eaten at Julio's, the food has tasted wonderful. The service is top notch and the prices are great. If you're looking for good Mexican food and margaritas check out Julio's."}
{"text":"Whether I'm in a hurry on lunch hour, or want to take my time - this is consistently my go to place for Mexican food. I'm a creature of habit and cannot bring myself to venture away from the excellent chicken tacos and chicken enchiladas. This is also one of the few places that I look forward to the rice and beans, as opposed to eating them because the main course is all gone. I love their salsa and chips as well. Finally, the staff is great every time I come in here."}
{"text":"Not only is this place great for a quick and tasty Mexican dinner, but the employees here are FANTASTIC as well! My husband and I frequent J-Too a lot, I didn't realize how much until today. My husband was on his way home from work, and unfortunately was hit by a red light runner right in front of this restaurant. When I arrived to the scene, one of the employees came out and gave us some cold water bottles, and then said he remembers us from when we dine in, he said he was sorry to see the accident and hopes my husband recovers quickly, then he offered us a discount on dinner. His kindness was so appreciated during this stressful and scary time! Then, while we were eating our meal another customer's car battery died, and I think the manager offered to find jumper cables and help charge their battery. It was so cool to experience and see these guys go the extra step! We'll be back! Thanks again!!"}
{"text":"Super yummy crispy tacos and chicken fajitas.  My \"Go to\" for take out on the way home."}

{"text":"Everyone is aware that Scottsdale is an upscale town with money to burn. My wife and I love looking for places where the tourists don't  go to and the locals eat great food. Juilo's  Too fits the bill. I always check out Yelp reviews to see what people have to say about a place I might go to . I was in the mood for tamales. A fellow Yelper said he had been coming to Julio's for the past 25 years for the Green Chile Tamales. I order the 3 item combo getting 2 Green Chile Tamales and one Red Beef Tamale. With a container of black beans and some rice the huge plate of food was not what I expected. I The Red Beef Tamale was very good but like the fellow Yelper said the star of my dish was the Green Chile Tamale. All 3 tamales were huge. The Red Beef Tamale had a very nice  Ranchero sauce. All of the tamales were smothered with cheese. My wife had a 2 item combo with a Black Bean Burrito and the Spinach Enchilada. Both dish were packed with so much food we didn't even eat a quarter of the great chips and salsa that comes before the meal. They have all day $2.50 margaritas which were nice. We had leftover galore. For under $35 we ate like royalty. Service was informative and very friendly. We  definitely  found a gem of a Mexican restaurant that is not fancy but has great food. As Dark Vader says\" I'LL BE BACK\"."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant in Arizona. The food is so authentic and flavorful, it can't be beat! I always order the polo magn√≠fico  so juicy, flavorful, creamy, and full of love. Plus the beans and rice are to die for! 

Another great option is the spinach cheese carne asada burrito, carne asada fries, chimichangas, enchiladas and of course burritos enchilada style! Love their salsas and cream cheese sauce is so delicious. I wish they had more and need to reopen the one on Val Vista! LOVE THIS PLACE SO MUCH.

Also have a great selection of beer (:"}
{"text":"I have been here many times but last few trips I ordered a burro..it was filled with mostly rice and beans and very little meat. Very disappointed and will not go back."}
{"text":"What makes this just ok is the salsa... Can't say it enough it SUCKS!!! The premixed Margs are good a couple of the large ones and you're feelin it. Plenty of beer options if you prefer. Portions are large and tasty."}
{"text":"We wanted to try local place and Mexican was on our mind. Based on Yelp reviews we decided to give this restaurant a try. There was simply no parking space so we thought the food might be really good. We parked almost a block away and walked in hot sun to enjoy the lunch. The guy at the counter was really not much into taking our order and finally got my husband's order wrong but charged the bill correctly so we don't know if the cook or the server messed up. Thankfully cousin and I got our orders correctly. The service wasn't all that good. The food strictly tasted okay. I have better Mexican food around."}
{"text":"Only tried on beef taco, but not too great. The shredded beef didn't seem shredded, it seems more mushy and chopped. The taco shell was crispy, but outlandishly greasy at the bottom, which is typical, but this was too much grease. The taco was big and worth the $2.55, but the chicken option sadly is dark meat. The free chips and salsa (mild) were probably the best part of the this snack. Salsa was in small cups, but fresh and chips were hot and tasty. Big negative is not having horchata, even the counter girl questioned the manager on this big oversight. Decent lunch special - will give the place one more try for the tamale in the near future."}
{"text":"My search for a Mexican Restaurant in AZ that compares to Southern California Mexican food is now over. This place is fantastic! My five stars is not just for the food, the customer service is phenomenal as well. My wife and I were greeted with warm smiles and friendly demeanors.  I had the three item combo which consisted of a chile relleno, cheese enchilada,  and shredded beef taco. The chile relleno I could tell was freshly made with a perfect crunch, unlike many places that make them ahead of time resulting in a soggy unflavorful mess hidden by loads of crappy sauce and cheese on top. The taco was bursting with authentic Mexican flavor and freshly grated cheese. The enchilada sauce was probably the best I've ever had,  definitely not from a can. My wife had the two taco meal and opted for a chicken and beef taco.  She kept talking about how much they reminded her of the amazing Mexican food we left behind in Orange County,  California, where there is an excellent Mexican place on every corner.   Our meal came with a basket of perfectly fried tortilla chips and delicious salsa.  We had the option of mild or hot salsa and I asked for one of each,  both being yummy. Upon leaving,  we asked to buy a bag of chips to bring back home with us.  The nice young man kindly bagged it for us and said \"no charge,  have a great day\"...a perfect ending to a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Best chicken tacos I've ever had! I have craving for them!!! I've been coming here forever and it's one of my favorite places to eat ever! So many good things to say about this place! Can't say enough."}
{"text":"Flying makes me hungry. Actually life makes me hungry, but flying makes me extra hungry.  It's hard work sitting on that plane for 4 hours! So as soon as I landed in Phoenix last night I was ready for some grub. Gabi K picked me up from the airport and took me straight to Julio's Too to meet some of her friends for dinner. 

When we arrived there was a basket of chips and lots of salsa waiting for us...thanks Julio!  As I filled up on chips I checked out the menu and was torn between the shrimp fajitas and fish tacos.  I decided on the shrimp tacos (as did Gabi) and soon we were greeted with LOTS of food. We probably should have shared, but like I said before...flying makes me hungry.  I've had better fajitas in my life, but they were tasty and VERY filling.

Of course I managed to eat much more than one of Gabi's friends who's 4 months pregno, but I'll blame my piggyness on the flying."}
{"text":"Thanks, Yelpers, for reaquainting me with this establishment.!
This is really good TexMex, very inexpensive, and you get tons of food for very little money. 
I had the 2 item combo with a shredded beef taco (big, wonderful and filling) but didn't stop there, and ate the beef burrito too (oink, I am) ...and I managed to consume enough rice and beans and chips to blow myself into the next county (ok, I'll stop there)...
Good food, great prices, and it's casual and quick. 
Loved it!"}
{"text":"Julio's has pluses and minuses which equal out to about three stars in my book.  FIrst, let's outline the positive-Pollo Magnifico and the big star is actually the CHICKEN!!  I could actually do just fine with just a little less of the jalapeno cream cheese sauce/cheddar on top because the chicken really holds it's own. I must admit this is a dish that I cannot get past.  I order it every time I go, it's that good!
Minuses would be the mopes behind the counter (I am not a regular patron but every single time I go the counter help is dreadful-thank goodness it's a short encounter), their salsas are free and worth price charged (they have a sweet/fake taste to me), and yucky Pepsi products at the pop dispenser (a.k.a. Diet PineSol)."}
{"text":"Lately they have really been falling apart.
My office is around the corner, so I used to order from Julio's once a week.
The food was always tasty and fresh. But now there is a new manager, he is rude, never smiles, never looks you in the eye and the food has really gone down hill.
My last lunch actually gave me the runs.
Too bad, now I have to find another place for my Mexican lunches."}
{"text":"Yummmm amazing.... i you want good Mexican food and good margaritas. This is the place to go. It's always busy but you are in and out. Lunch specials are great. Love this place."}
{"text":"Love this place. My family has been going here for fresh and delicious mexican food since 2000. More important than the great food, is the customer service. David always provides great customer service and is so welcoming to every customer. They know my order as soon as they see me coming in the door. I love the chicken fajitas and the taco's can't be beat! If it was closer to where we lived I would be here every week chowing down on the great salsa and chips!"}
{"text":"This place is great for some decently priced Mexican food in this part of town. You can expect to pay about $10/person if you're getting a combination plate, and you can either take your food to go or eat in their little dining area inside or on their patio. I've had their bean and cheese burrito (which is only about $4), and I was not disappointed. The portions are pretty big, and everything tastes super fresh. 

This is definitely the spot to go to if you're wanting to grab some Mexican food to take home, but the ambience inside is a bit bleh."}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever had a bad experience at Julio's. I love the mini chimis (comes with jalape√±o cream cheese) and the queso dip - both are to die for! You get free chips and salsa (they have both mild and hot) with your order and the staff is super attentive and always asks if we need more. The service is quick and everyone is so nice, it really has a home-y feel to it. 

They have a good selection of beers, both local and name brands. They cater, and while I've never thrown a party fancy enough to need catering, when I've been to events catered by them the food is still superb. 

Parking can be tight in the lot, especially since people park there to go to old town (despite the fact you'll get towed), but there is street parking near by."}
{"text":"For quick service and always satisfying my taste for lazy comfort food, this place rocks. Do not come here for great service or ambiance, its a take-out place more than anything else.  I've tried several of their dishes but always resort back to my classic/no-frills order: two chicken tacos. These fill me up and have a respectable amount of chicken in them. The fried taco shells and shredded cheese is what I'm really craving but since the chicken actually provides nutrition it's a nice balance. 
I don't care for the albonginas soup - too oily. They do a very good job of keeping the salads healthy as long as you don't eat the shell it's a good healthy meal. The nachos are. .... nachos. Order those for your drunk friends.
Back to my point - in my experience stick with the tacos if that's what you're in the mood for. I'll choose these tacos over Best Little Taco shop or Blind Pig any day. ¬°Ol√©!"}
{"text":"Julio's Too is a great place to get your tex-mex fix quickly & satisfactorily. The menu is really big and there are a lot of vegetarian options. I give them a high rating because the veggie taco salad has to be one of the best I've ever had, and I've eaten a ton of taco salads. They put real romaine lettuce in it, a ton of freshly sauteed veggies, a light sprinkling of cheese, good black beans, and a nice healthy dollop of fresh & good guacamole. I also had a green corn tamale which was alright, but the sauce (which you have to pay extra for but is totally worth it) is amazing - it's flavorful, thick, comforting. The tamale itself seemed a little dry, mushy, and bland to me. I didn't really like the free chips (too thin) & their free salsa (boring flavor) didn't impress me much."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times to pick up lunch. Everything is really good and they have great prices! One thing I would remark on is the customer service isn't that great, also expect to wait awhile even if it's not that busy. The food is seriously so good though! Definitely a good place to go to to grab some lunch! I recommend the smothered burrito or the mini chimis!!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Julio's too for about 6 years. It is one of my favorite places in the valley to get Mexican food, especially if your just looking for something quick or something to take home with you! I have never tried anything that was not good. Some of my favorites are the tacos, red chili burro and the mini chimi's with jalape√±o cream cheese! I also love that they have Mexican sodas in the fridge. Nothing like a Mexican coke to go with your meal!"}
{"text":"Always have enjoyed my meals and service here. Nothing to rant or rave about but everything is pretty on point at this Mexican restaurant. 

Pros
- Decent food
- Quick service
- Good portions
- Free chips and salsa

Cons
- Not the greatest customer service
- Crowded inside seating"}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but I just love Julio's.  I've been to all of them.  The Pollo Magnifico is to die for.  I hate it because it tastes so good, but is so bad for you.  It's a guilty pleasure that I just have to indulge in every now and then!  But, when I'm not eating a dish worth every bite of it's cheesy, deep fried 3,000 calories, a fajita barrito is a nice choice.  The queso dip is great and in general I've never been disappointed. 

I've been going to Julio's since I was a kid and I will be going until I'm old and frail- I love you Julio's!!!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a nice hidden gem in the Old Town Scottsdale area. They have awesome Mexican food here and relatively inexpensive as well. So far I have ordered the enchiladas and tacos here and thought they were great. The chicken enchilada was one of the best that I've had so far. The ordering process is simple and I liked the casual atmosphere. I have gone back a few times and had a great experience each time."}
{"text":"You will never be disappointed here . It's got what you want the tacos are killer , rellenos classic , can't say enough . Try it you will be hooked . Parking is kind of pain sometimes"}
{"text":"Having had a few decent menu items in the past decided to give this local restaurant another try and explore more of the menu.  Last visits included the spinach enchilada and various tacos which earned 4 stars.  For today's visit I had the grilled chicken breast which was prepared by an undetermined method and from a unknown source, somewhere between a processed frozen chicken breast and pressed chicken mystery meat that you'd find in fast food restaurant, it had little flavor and an odd texture.  While I can't say for certain it wasn't 100% chicken breast and grilled in some manner in the end it the finished product tasted like neither.   I'd hesitate to try this place again except for the two items mentioned above which were on par for the restaurant category of fast casual Mexican."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. The staff is friendly and the food is always fresh and tasty as hell. Awesome Mexican food, and great location; it's close to everything in Old Town."}
{"text":"I went here with my grandparents and Dad the other day... 

My grandparents go here enough that they are recognized by the staff. :)

So you walk in and it looks very much like a mexican 5 and diner.  Very bright mexican restaurant colors (turquoise, red, yellow) and neon lights.  Modern-ish type decor... but not all the mexican decor like you would find in a normal mexican restaurant.

The full bar was a cool touch though.  I didn't get to try any drinks... didn't think I should get tipsy in front of my grandparents. lol

I had the Tiajuana Taco plate... it was good, but nothing to write home about.  My dad enjoyed his enchiladas and my grandpa got a veggie platter that was HUGE.  Veggie soup, grilled veggies and something else I wasn't able to recognize right away but he loved every single bit of it.

The chips and salsa... I could eat it for days.  Awesome.

The fast food side of Julio's is a nice touch, with menus you can take home to decide out of their large menu."}
{"text":"Dang...Julio's dishes out some pretty tasty Mexican food!  The chips and salsa were so tasty and I probably ate way too many before our meals came out.  The cheese enchiladas with rice and beans were so tasty...I am actually craving these again while writing this review.  Super friendly staff, quick service and amazing and simple food done right!"}
{"text":"The only reason I went is because my Dad wanted a taco.  The last few times I have eaten here it has been nothing but a greasy mess.  

I miss the days when Julio G's was down the street.  The quality control and level of care to the food has gone WAY down hill in the last few years, and it is really sad to see.  

With it being right next to the W, you'd think they would strive to be the best place ever.  If I was staying there, I'd walk to downtown and find something else."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! First and foremost the staff is awesome, and the place is clean. I eat there about every 2 weeks and the food is always good! Born & raised right here in Az with a wide variety of Mexican restaurants, I always come back to Julio's. 

This year for my family Christmas party we ordered platters from Julio's, everything was perfect, they even made sure I had enough chips & salsa. 

This place is a must try!!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend the sinful Pollo Magnifico. Great portion size, terrific flavor and fair cost. Anything at Julio's Too is going to be top notch so you really can't go wrong. Favorite Mexican eatery I've had in my 5+ years living in AZ."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times now since its close to my work, & have not been disappointed yet.  Today I got the pork green-chilli burrito served enchilada style, TOTAL MOUTHGASM!"}
{"text":"Great service and food. I ordered the chicken taco and chicken enchilada combo. It comes with rice and beans as well. The portions are generous and they also give you an order of chips. The hot salsa was flavorful. I was disappointed that they don't serve horchata or jamaica here hehe. If I'm in the area again, I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"I stepped out of my comfort zone of carby, cheesey grease and tried the fish taco (orange roughy) combo.  It was good.  The fish was not breaded and was cooked perfectly.  I could have done without the rice and beans to save calories, but those were good too.  They give a mayonaisey salsa mixture to put in your tacos.  It was pretty good, but I think fresh lemons or limes to squeeze over the tacos would have been better.  

If you are not a carb queen, this was a good choice and relatively healthy."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican restaurants I've ever been too. Prices are shockingly cheap. Food is delicious. The fried burrito was perfect and so was the Mexican pizza. I'd eat here all the time if I could. Great deals on margaritas too."}
{"text":"Love this place. Chicken Chimi is my go to!! Can't beat the margarita price! Only downside is that the parking lot is tiny."}
{"text":"Well I have come here for years at this location matter fact since it was built. Things continue to change and head down hill.  New owners, etc etc, Julio's Too,  I went to a lot, was always a great place a long time ago. Now the place year after year is falling apart piece by piece, same broken stool in front for almost 2 years, salsa bar discontinued, which is fine but take it out it collects trash, the stainless steel is stained everywhere, no one cleans anything here anymore.  The chip dumpster for fresh chips looks slightly cleaner than one for outside trash.  I have visted the place 4 times in 60 days and no one ever wipes tables down, sweeps the floor or wipes stainless steel down.  Has Broken drain cover below the dirty soda fountain, signs in paper taped up on equipment, but front cashier folks stand around board between customers and do no cleaning.  I see manager do nothing to motivate his staff at all on all the occasions I came to eat, which means it lies on the shoulders of the manager and the ownership, that you guys don't care anymore to clean it up, and or renew the place.  I cannot come by and spend one Dollar more of my money anymore."}
{"text":"Best place in Scottsdale to get casual Mexican food.  Our favorite Mexican take-out place by far, but dining in is nice too, very friendly staff and they have margaritas!   It's counter service, so be prepared to stand in line...it can get crowded, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"This place is great, it always has been!!!

I am going to start with service, It could not have been any better for the environment, fast friendly, accommodating, and just kind. Not gushy or desperate, just all around good especially from the cashier, who might be the manager or owner, and the guy with the FREE CHIPS and Salsa. \"if you would like more of either, just let me know\" Wow that alone makes me want to come back.

My lunch was exceptional, with 2 big stuffed shredded beef tacos with rice and beans with a Pepsi for less then 10 bucks. The tacos were as good as I remember and the rice and beans were just the right size, along with some shredded lettuce and diced tomatoes. 

The place itself was welcoming for me because every detail in the lobby was perfect from beer cooler to counters, the floors were spotless and the beverage station was well stocked and gleaming.

If you are wondering if this should be on your list, I say YES. its casual and you order at the counter but there is beer and Margaritas so enjoy a little casual done right!"}
{"text":"Been here more than a few times after finding them on Yelp a couple years back. 

The cashier's here are pretty slow in my opinion, it always takes a while for me to order. The one thing I like is that they give you chips and salsa while you wait for your food. Prepare to wait. This is not a taco shop, this is a fast casual Mexican restaurant.

The food here is okay, some options are better than others. My favorite are the tamales which are pretty good. I've also had just about every taco on the menu and the carnitas as well (which I would never order again). The beans and rice also aren't that good, they're not bad just not that good.

Overall it's not a bad option if you're looking for serviceable Mexican food in old town."}
{"text":"The food is decent for the price, and we eat here fairly often.  The chips are good, as is the salsa.  My family eats everything from burritos, tacos, to mini chimichangas, and all are flavorful.  My only real complaint is that the service isn't great.  The people who work the counter are monotone and border on rude half the time.  They are also stingy with chips when you order to go.  They give you a decent amount when you eat in, but with a to go order, they balk at giving you enough for the order.   Other than that - no real complaints and will continue to frequent for the food."}
{"text":"This is an excellent \"hole-in-the-wall, locals\" Mexican restaurant.  Food and service all outstanding -- if we ever return to Scottsdale, this is where we'll go for good Mexican food."}
{"text":"So I've driven by this place for years and finally stopped in. I got the green corn tamale and cheese enchilada combo plate with rice and bean and it was Too good! They also have free chips and salsa and the $2.50 margarita was on point for the price. Definitely not luxurious inside, but it was comfortable and busy! I'll be back to Julio's Too...but wondering where Julio's Juan is?"}
{"text":"2 may be too many stars.. had a chili that wasn't cooked, with greasy batter and unmelted cheese.  My dining partner had tacos that missed the mark... really soggy and dripping with grease, and not in a good way.  With so many great taco shops in a city that prides itself on Mexican food, drive right past Julio Too's..... save your money and your stomach for better food anywhere!"}
{"text":"I was mildly okay with Julios because it was cheap and it never made extravagant claims to being very good.  It's greasy, overly-cheesed \"Mexican\" food that's bad for you.  Sometimes that's what you want... the large, lousy portions for not much money with shredded bits of iceberg lettuce.  Make no mistake, it's not good, but sometimes we all have our guilty pleasures and sub-adequate Mexican food happens to be one of mine sometimes--usually when I'm hungover or something.

Last time I went there, I popped open a little salsa container for the chips and, Jesus Christ, it was a solidified gelatinous cube.  It wasn't frozen, either.  It was gelatin.  It was this... ugh.  It was denser than Jell-O, too, you could slice it with a plastic knife and it would continue standing on its own.

And that's when I realized that what I was eating wasn't just bad food that's fun to treat yourself too every couple of months or a few times a year, I was eating a pile of failure.  The novelty was gone.  It's all fun and games until you see that salsa.  It's like having fun drinking in a dirty dive bar, then you fall down on a pile of broken glass.  The fun's over... clean up the glass, guys.  Start making fucking salsa in a food processor and take some goddamn pride in what you do."}
{"text":"Was great food and atmosphere. It's a small charming place. Looks a little old from the curb appeal but when u eat the food it's awesome. Got chips & salsa. The chips are thin and crisp. We ordered cheese enchiladas, corn tamale, bean burrito & bean tostado. They were pretty heavy handed on the chz on the enchiladas & tostadas. Good news if you like chz. I do but it was too over powering. The service was EXCELLENT. Happy cashier and there was someone in the seating area making sure the customers were good and the place was clean."}
{"text":"This place fails. Just totally fails. I was forced to eat here one night even though all I wanted was a delicious burrito from one of the -erto's, Betos, or Fiesta Burrito. But no, I was coerced into coming here because they're \"open late\" and my friend swore up down and backwards that it was \"amazing\". I really should have known better because her favorite Mexican place is Arriba-really?! I feel bad for her, because there's so much great Mexican food in this town! 

OK, so they decided to extend their hours, but you know what? THEY CUT THEIR MENU TO FIVE ITEMS AFTER 1 AM! Not cool. 

Pro: The golf cart that drove us here from Dos Gringos...apparently it's a club shuttle, but has \"Julio's Too\" written all over it, and the guy driving it said he's work for them for 10 years and that the owner of the golf shuttle also owns Julio's Too. This driver claimed everything here was \"delicious\" but couldn't be specific about any item. Hmmmm, I wonder if that's because...

Con: THE FOOD SUCKED. It was just plain bad. I mean, I eat from some grimy burrito places, and their food is AMAZING compared to the stuff they're passing off as food here. Maybe it's because we went late, but either way I decided to play it safe and order a bean and cheese burrito that I could barely eat five bites of before completely giving up on it. Others in my party ordered the carne asada burrito (oh, I should mention that I was the only sober one here-everyone in my party was absolutely sloshed), and most of them ate all of it, but later told me how bad it was and what a bad idea it was to eat it. They said they would have much rather gone to a good place (which I agreed with!), and collectively we all agreed never to come here again. 

Next time you see the Julio's Too shuttle driver pass by, ask him for a ride to the nearest GOOD Mexican place! Or even the philly cheesesteak place near the bars which is decent. Just stay away from this place."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place.  One of the most important things for me in Mexican food is salsa and hot sauce.  I do enjoy their versions here. The rest of the food is not great though.  The only thing I will eat here is a taco, they are pretty good and if you do decide to venture in I would recommend them.  Everything else I've had is blah. Not bad but not good either.  My mom and I come here everyonce in a while when we are in the area and want tacos. So that's that."}
{"text":"Really friendly service. Quick and excellent food. Light, fluffy tamales- not heavy gutbombs. Green chili pork burrito was very good as well. Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour Margarita for $2.50 how can you beat that! Great food and great service love this place!"}
{"text":"Best shredded beef tacos in all of Scottsdale/ Phoenix!!! Thank you so much for having them. Being from Los Angeles I was so excited that an amazing tacos place was down the street from our favorite hotel in n old town Scottsdale! Also the chips are so thin and crispy, definitely very fresh. Everyone working looks super happy, so you know the service us gonna be good if the staff is happy! Thanks again, we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Classic texmex great for kids and the whole fam. Cervezas and margaritas served cold. Mini chimis are among my favorite items to get before work. Good to share or pig out on if your really hungry. Overall great place to go!"}
{"text":"this is a very family friendly restaurant. the employees are very welcoming and go out of their way to make sure you have a good time eating. AMAZING food, definitely would recommend the $2.50 margaritas. the nice blonde lady at the counter is always a joy to talk to and makes my experience that much better."}
{"text":"We self catered for around 40 people with a couple days notice and it was so good! All of our guests raves about the food. Highly recommend spinach enchiladas and chili rellanos."}
{"text":"Such a cute little place to have dinner with friends. Probably the best carne asada tacos I've ever had. The free chips and salsa are delicious and I love that they have different spice levels to choose from. Amazing place and has become my fianc√© and I's go to Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"I love Julios too!!!!!! The best mexican food around. Free chips and salsa and the Chicken Mini Chimis are to die for. Definitely a must if you haven't tried it.

P.s. writing a bad review about the restaurant for being a dumbass and parking in the parking lot to go out clubbing, resulting in getting towed, isn't the restaurants fault. Follow the parking rules!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. In town for a bachelorette party & after 24 hours, I've been here twice. The chicken quesadilla has stewed chicken that is super moist & very well balanced with the cheese. Also has the spinach enchilada - yummy as well. Massive portions with free chips & fresh tasting salsa. The $2 margs aren't great but they're $2 so I didn't expect much. Can I bring this place back to NYC with me?!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Julio's for 15 years. Recently I have noticed the quality of the food has gone way down. Mini chimis are always good (hard to mess up), but the things that take more time and effort have been lacking. I think they are not trying hard anymore and it shows by the shorter lines and no one in the restaurant when I go.

Now, I just go to order mini chimis for my kids and go some place else for me. Sad, this used to be a staple in my family."}
{"text":"A disappointment. Pollo magnifico was tasty although a bit weird and with massive amounts of jalape√±o sour cream. Carne asada tacos were tough and without good flavor. Sopapilla was bizarre, more like a deep fried pancake. On the plus side, it was clean, cheap, fast, with good service. But that didn't make up for the food. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Good food. Reasonable prices . Service was surprisingly speedy for a weekday lunch hour."}
{"text":"This is literally the best Mexican food in Scottsdale I'm in love with this place I've had at least half the menu. The shredded beef tacos, tostadas, chimichangas, burritos, all of it is to die for! But the salsa is so fresh and amazing you can order half pints because you won't be able to stop eating it."}
{"text":"Have been going here a lot recently - they never disappoint! And now we found out their patio is dog friendly - we love it even more! 

The food is always great, and the margaritas are tasty, and cheap. They are ALWAYS friendly! Love them!!"}
{"text":"Very good service ! The guys were awesome very patient & recommended a few of their fav items 
Free chips & salsa is always a bonus.  $2.50 all day happy hour margaritas is a nice touch.  The mild salsa is tasty but the hot is a little to hot and bland I mixed the two and it was just right.  I'll be back"}
{"text":"Surprised at 4 star rating. The place is constantly busy. Good food, free chips and salsa. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I am not the biggest fan of Mexican food but this location has become a regular lunch time delight. Julio's has great combos, the re-fried beans and rice are perfect and the burros enchilada style are just what  the doctor ordered.  I used to think that  Chipotle had some of  the best Mexican food around but this is my neighborhood spot now. The have a punch card where if you purchase 9 lunch combos you get the 10th free. They also offer free tortilla  chips and your choice of mild or spicy salsa. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is legit for a few reasons - their food is authentic and the service is always friendly and quick.  If you dine in their happy hour deal on margaritas is pretty good too!  Great salsa and all of their offerings are fresh and tasty.  There aren't a ton of great Mexican joints near old town but I think this is one of the better options so I'll probably visit every other month or so.  More often than not we get take out and they haven't ever gotten the order wrong which is a plus!"}
{"text":"Fish tacos were awesome and authentic. Cool spot to grab a quick bite. All ingredients were fresh and at a great price"}
{"text":"Pros: Good food
           Big place
           Good costumer service
Cons:
            Awful margarita"}
{"text":"Ew. Not the best Mexican food. The plates are too greasy and the guacamole tastes like it came from a can. Even the chips were meh. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"The food is awesome. This place used to be a sit down restaurant, but now it's mostly takeout. The people at the counter are nice and very efficient. 

Everything I have eaten here is authentic from old Arizona restaurants. It's like you would expect at a taco stand where all your old friends get their comida Mexicana."}
{"text":"Can't believe I have lived down the street from Julio's Too since 02/01/10 and I only tried them 11/03/12. They have great combos, the re-fried beans and rice are perfect and the burros enchilada style are just what I crave when I want Mexican food. My husband is not as keen on Mexican food he thinks Chipotle is the best Mexican in the world but he has picked up lunch here several times without any suggestions from me. So this is our neighborhood spot now, so sorry I never visited before. The have a punch card purchase 9 lunch combos get the 10th free and also they offer free chips and salsa."}
{"text":"The best. Grew up on Julios. My friends use this restaurant to get me out of my house when I don't want to go out"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed coming here for lunch the other day and plan on making Julio's Too my go to place for Mexican food in Scottsdale.

They have a large menu with all the classics and their prices are very reasonable.  Best of all, the meals come with free unlimited delicious chips and salsa.

I had a chicken burrito enchilada style for lunch.  It was $7.50 and came with rice and beans.  It was delicious and very filling.  

I noticed that some people got their food in a to go container even though they were eating in the restaurant.  I think this is a great idea so that you don't have to eat it all at once and can just pop the lid on the container and leave when you're done.

They also have a decent craft beer selection and not just Corona, Modelo, etc."}
{"text":"We love Julios !!!!!! We are never disappointed with takeout. Always delivers as the best Mexican restaurant  in town!!!"}
{"text":"Returned for another dinner with friends last night... 
While the food was still A-OK, the service was not.  Our waiter didn't check on us very often, and we waited several times for water refills, salsa refills, and to pay the bill.

I don't recommend Julio's if you are in a hurry, but it's still a decent place to fill the Mexican craving!"}
{"text":"Went here because of the \"shop small\" AmEx event. I love texmex food so I have been curious, but I don't think I will be back. Texmex is greasy, but when you eat part of your food and the one inch void in the container is filled with a clear liquid (oil) you lose your appetite.  Besides the food seemed like one step above Mexican day at school.

The snowbirds seem to love this place, but there are other options that involve less of a wait and less lubricant."}
{"text":"We love coming here for a quick dinner. Portions are big, and the quality is constant. It's usually pretty quiet, never had to wait for a table or been there with big crowds. They do a ton of catering and to-go business, but we like eating there. Free chips & salsa while you wait!"}
{"text":"i love this place! i love greasy mexican food and this place has the best! the tacos are so delicious and the chips are always fresh!"}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this place for a while now as it is just down the street and I've seen great reviews. We Postmate'd our order and at first glance I was very impressed. The Mini Chimichangas looked crispy on the outside and the portions were large. Unfortunately as I was eating the Chimichangas I noticed there was something else mixed into the meat. It was like this weird soft cartilage but in strips (similar to a sheet of beancurd if you know what that is lol) I lost my appetite after seeing it and went through each chimi only to find there was at least a couple strips in every one. I don't know what they are but definitely unappetizing. My friend chose the better route getting vegetarian food, but she said there was nothing special about her food."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, especially for the price. I definitely wasn't mad with the Pollo Con Queso!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. The food is good for a cheap Mexican restaurant (you get what you pay for). I would highly recommend calling ahead of time to place your order or  you will wait forever. The staff is always friendly. Overall not a bad place to eat."}
{"text":"Nice staff and the food is great. I love their chips and their hot sauce! Fantastic. We are regulars now - we're there or picking up a to go order at least once a week."}
{"text":"I'm from Texas, so I'm used to Tex-Mex, and this was a little different, mostly in a good way.

I had a combo to try some different things.
1) Beef taco - fantastic, the taco shell was fresh and the beef was delicious
2) Red beef tamale - the biggest tamale I have ever seen.  Maybe too big, as the beef flavor was lost
3) Bean burrito - fairly plain, beans and some cheese in a tortilla, no sauce or anything.

The rice and beans were good, and the side of guac I got tasted just like I make at home, so I was happy with it.  The margarita was also decent, nothing fancy but tasty and with a salted cup - not frozen junk out of a machine, but freshly made.

Unfortunately the salsa didn't impress me, but I think that is because I'm used to a thicker salsa.  It was runny with some chili seeds that gave a little kick, but not a lot of flavor.

I'd go back though, I think I'd try a chimi or more tacos next time."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today and was not disappointed. Got a lunch special and it was huge for the price, more than fair portions and prices! I ordered it in and the phone service was good so I imagine the staff being great. The enchilada style burrito was so good, I'm coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Walked in at 7:24 person taking order must be new as he struggled with the order. No big deal. It took 30 minutes to get food with only one other couple in front of us. Too long for this concept. They were busy filling salsa's and seemed not to be about the customers currently here. Food was great as always but a family came in at 7:45 as was suggested the go next door as we close at 8:30. The mom replied it's only 7:45?The manager replied I know but when have to be out of here at 8:30 I'm just telling you! Left at 8:10 they had not received their food yet. I was embarrassed for them. If you don't want business after 8 put up a sign saying take out only. This IS the Manager, worst customer service I have seen in a long time. If they got their food in 30 minutes like mine they had 15 to eat and get the hell out. Many other places to spend your hard earned  dollar. Will  think twice about going back. PS  I worked in the rest. biz for 25 yrs as an hourly employee  all the way to owning 2 myself."}
{"text":"This is the take-out version of Julio G's and is attached to is. There are some tables inside, but most people get it to go. Most of the time it is really good but it is not quite as consistent as the sit-down version."}
{"text":"Great food!! Will definitely be going again and again! My mom said it was the best Mexican food she's ever had and that says a lot given she's a world traveler from San Francisco. She had the seafood enchilada I had the chicken spinach enchilada and we shard the sinful spinach quest dip. Yummy yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Hard pressed to find an above avg. mexican food eatery in Scottsdale look no further than Julio's Too.  This place has quality food for your dollar.  Place your order then sit down at a clean table enjoy a cold one or a Margarita pick up your food take home or eat there.  Green Chile Corn Tamales very good , Beef Machaca Burrito excellent as well as the Spinach Enchiladas, the spicy salsa not over powering with hot and spicy ingredients ask for extra have some fun.  Parking is at a premium at this place that is the only challenge here as the food is pretty darn good."}
{"text":"One of the only restaurants that I actually CRAVE.  I am a forever fan.  The food is great, the service is great, the place is clean and the prices are low for the portion.  If you are looking for some great Mexican and you're in the area, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"We love this place.  Its our families go to for quick, good, Mexican food.  Prices are fair as well."}
{"text":"Amazing food and very generous portions. We were referred by the man working the desk at our hotel and he did not lead us astray. Incredible authentic experience in the heart of Scottsdale. Love it."}
{"text":"Really nice staff, totally impressed by the young gentleman who too our order. This is a regular spot for one of my good friends, I see why, great staff and good food is a great combination."}
{"text":"This place was right across the street from the hotel I was staying at and boy am I happy I stopped in! I had the beef tacos, rice and beans which was delicious! The free chips and salsa was a surprise too. The staff was friendly and speedy, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It looks like a \"where the locals go\" kind of place, which I love when visiting a new town. And it must be because While we waited for our order, the staff new several customers who came in- repeat customers, that's a good sign right?! We weren't disappointed, we had a large order and everything was Very tasty! We would definitely go back.."}
{"text":"really good authentic mexican food at a decent price. the staff is very good as well. i wasn't crazy about their salsa but everything else was simply delicious! recommend it and i know a lot of other ppl who have enjoyed it as well."}
{"text":"The waiters are great and friendly. The was was good. First time being here and i had not realized that they have their tables and then the small sections of per say fast food on the side. Would have liked to be given the notice that they had that section there. Otherwise, it was good."}
{"text":"Well. If you like greasy Mexican cuisine this is the place to dine. Certaunily not the same quality food that is served.at the original Julios. Save your money and go to Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Julio's is my go to place for Mexican when I'm Scottsdale. I've never had any issues but the past 2 times I've called in an order and told the time it would be ready it's been a horrible experience. The 1st we had to wait at least 30 minutes past the pick up time and was late getting back to work. Today we waited at least 15 minutes past the pick up time. When speaking to the staff we were degraded and told to call earlier next time. Thing is we did!! Our pick up time was WAY before any lunch rush. The staff didn't seem to give a $&/! that we waited for our food long after it was due. We don't think it was even started until after we showed up. Even tho their food is excellent, I'm not sure if I will come back."}
{"text":"Very basic. Food is food. Wish I had just went with my gut and got chipotle. They have unlimited chips but they are the flavorless kind. Spent 10 bucks on a glob of beans, meat(?) and rice. Only would come back if someone really wanted to try."}
{"text":"Yum Yum. I like Julios too. It doesn't look like it from the outside, but they have tables inside and they also have a patio so you have a lot of options of dining in or getting takeout. If you come for lunch the lunch specials are cheap but you are going to be lethargic when you go back to work. They also have drinks in here which seems kind of random. I've only gotten a margarita here once but it seemed pretty strong for the $3 or whatever it was. Also, you get free chips and salsa which is always a plus in my book. The carne asada tacos are my fave, but I like the taco salad and the green corn tamale is delish as well."}
{"text":"I always get the Pollo Magnifico and it never disappoints. The staff is very friendly and makes you feel welcome. The only issue is the parking. I drove around for 10 minutes today looking for a spot, but the food is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing but the service is lacking. Every time I place a lunch order to go, I have to wait beyond the quoted time. I usually am quoted 30-45 minutes from the time I call. I never arrive before the quoted time and still have to wait. I've had to wait 25 minutes past the quoted time totaling an hour from the time I placed my call. When it was brought to the employees attention, he apologized and called over a woman with blonde hair. She forced an apology that was completely insincere. She said they get orders called in starting at 9am which I'm not really sure how that affects my call. She obviously knows what orders are ahead of my call. To top it off, when I got back to the office, I realized they forgot a bag of chips."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. I've been visiting their Julio Too locations since the original Julio G's shut their doors. For fast and casual Mexican food, nothing beats it! I couldn't live life anymore if I didn't have my fix every week."}
{"text":"My wife and I were staying at the W Hotel next door and this little place was by far the cheapest place to eat and the best all in one!  The first thing was the excellent beer selection right when you walk in!   We stayed in Scottsdale for 3 days and ate there 3 days!  We just flew in from Texas to see a KISS concert, so we know Mexican food. 

We weren't expecting much, so the first day we just got a beer and a coke and they gave us free chips and salsa! We were amazed by the huge menu so the next day we got dinners and the food was pretty spectacular for under $20!  I had the pork chili and my wife had spinach enchiladas.  On our third day I had the chili relleno lunch and my wife had the taco salad.  We shared a margarita and still got 2 drinks for under $20!  Awesome. 

And then there's the service.  The guys at the counter noticed I was wearing a bacon shirt and we discussed bacon for a minute.  The second day we showed up, I was in a different bacon shirt and we talked bacon some more!   On the third day they were still amazed I had yet another bacon shirt (I have a LOT of bacon shirts).  They were great to have lunch and dinner with! 

I really liked the salsa too.  In Texas your salsa is always tomato, jalapeno, onion, and cilantro, but here they got the heat up with some other chiles and seasoning that made it special and good, though what they call hot was still pretty mild for us. 

Love,
Aaron

{"text":"Went to this place today for lunch and had the lunch special (D), Pollo Magnifico.  The plate comes with rice and beans as sides, and the entree is a deep fried chicken burrito with a jalape√±o cream cheese, and cheese topping.  I really enjoyed the Pollo Magnifico, but the rice was slightly over cooked and a little mushy, and the beans were over cooked and dry. You get free chips and salsa with your meal. The chips were fresh and the salsa was good. The place has a typical taco stand, cheesy atmosphere, but the service was friendly. Overall I would say this place deserves 3.5 stars, but that's not an option, so I will be kind and give it 4 stars."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a good mexican takeout place, and this one is great!
Had the chips and salsa and a chicken flauta, both were fantastic! :)"}
{"text":"Great price for the amount of food you get. Also, it taste great! Good location for all the nearby clubs and bars nearby."}
{"text":"This a local favourite and the food is pretty darn good.
We ate in this time - there was 5 of us and the restaurant wasn't busy.
The food servings are pretty decent and the service is always friendly.
It has a strong 'to go' service so it's pot luck on whether you get it on a busy or quiet period - but the service is fast and efficient.
Tastes are great, they have a super good menu with lots of choices and a variety of beers."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican food restaurant.  The cheese enchiladas are better than anywhere in the valley. Chinos, tacos and many good choices!"}
{"text":"Delicious and a great value!

Every time I crave Mexican food, I go here!  I typically share the 3 Item Combo for $9.95 and it's always perfect!  Whether we order the green corn tamale, chicken taco, bean tostada, enchilada, it's all great!  Chips and Salsa are tasty too!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We had lunch here not too long ago on recommendation. Though the servings were HUGE, I personally didn't like my quesadilla as it was a greasy, nasty mess. Also the chicken tasted as though it can out of a can.  Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food though....so maybe it was just me! :O)"}
{"text":"Just crappy Mexican food the best part was the Mexican flag in my food. But this a disgrace to Mexico in every way possible. Every single menu item taste the same.  The salsa is watery and nasty. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"YUMMMMM!   Very convenient little place. The food isn't like gourmet best Mexican food but it's still really good. I love the chicken flautas and chips and salsa. The rice and beans suck but who cares."}
{"text":"The big Julio's is closed and transformed into a breakfast place but I am so happy that Julio's Too has survived. Good, cheap, Mexican food. Two people could easily split a combo for a super-cheap lunch. Their take out is fast or there is a small seating area inside the restaurant. Or, to pick up dinner on the way home you can call ahead and have it waiting for you. I love that they serve beer bottles to go!"}
{"text":"When I entered this place I was confused if they were open or not. I had to walk around to find a server. I only stayed because I was meeting friends for brunch. The server was nice but messed up everyone's order. 
I won't even get started on the disappointment in the food."}
{"text":"Soooo good! Chicken tacos and cheese enchiladas are the best!  Their staff is so friendly and the chips and salsa (get the hot!) are yummy! When we ate here they were playing an 80's station too - perfect!"}
{"text":"Short and sweet....

-Close to work
-Lunch Specials
-Pollo Magnifico
-Mini Chimis w. jalapeno cream cheese

The end!  :D"}
{"text":"Great food, fast friendly service. If I'm area try for lunch and sit in beautiful outdoor seating area. Right outside Old Town so perfect place to relax with good food."}
{"text":"I had the Lunch Pollo Magnifico, yummy as always! Nice and crispy tortilla with delicious jalape√±o cream cheese. The absolute best hot sauce and guacamole with the chips. This is a huge portion so I'm lucky enough to have it again today!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for lunch with business associates for a number of years.  The staff is always friendly and courteous.  The prices are very reasonable with nice sized portions.  I usually get a two item combo for lunch and it's plenty of food.  It's not fast food, but your order comes out pretty quickly.  The food is authentic Mexican and I think it's a really good meal."}
{"text":"I went into Julio's yesterday for lunch.  Didn't start with a good impression at all.  When I ordered my margarita I was asked for my ID.  Understandable.  I've worked in the restaurant industry for 10+ years, I get it.  But I didn't even get a smile, or even eye contact.  I then stood there for about 5 minutes while the employees passed around my out-of-state license (I just moved here a few months ago, and I'm 24, btw).  I found this pretty unprofessional.  The older blonde was cashing me out and piled on the attitude.  If she had rolled her eyes one more time, I'm pretty sure they'd roll right out of her head.  The younger gentleman who brought out my burrito put the food down and walked away... that's it.  

My point is... if you like food, you miiiiiight like this place, it was mediocre.  If you like good service, don't waste your time.  If I was the owner of this restaurant, I would be embarrassed to employ these people.  They were rude, condescending, and pretenscious.  

I had the spinach and chicken burrito.  It was meh.  The margarita was great, but came in a plastic cup... pretty anticlimactic and non-environamentally friendly.  BOOOOOOO!"}
{"text":"I have nothing but great things to say. I first came here for lunch with work friends and was thrilled to have lots of vegetarian options. I am a vegetarian, but I LOVE Mexican food, cheese, loads of veggies and spicy food. They managed to meet all those needs and then some.

In addition, the people are so polite! I've had great customer service every time I've come and they even sent me away with some complimentary chips and salsa last time... and I didn't even buy an entree (Just chips and salsa for someone else). 

The quesadillas are the size of the moon, so there's that, too. We will be back again and again. So delicious.

Tip: It's a small place, so to-go is a great option!"}
{"text":"I've been to the majority of the big name taco shops in the valley  and man this place kills them all. Everything is very fresh, taco shells are magnificent, chips and salsa were perfect, and it's a very friendly place. 

They have a frozen take home selection which I think I'll take advantage of next time, because those frozen tamales were massive and looked delicious. 

I recommend this place to anyone looking for a quick lunch or just craving for a quick Mexican fix, it's amazing!"}
{"text":"First time here! To-go on a Sunday so I expected it wouldn't be quick and it wasn't. The food was excellent and that is what matters MOST for me. I have been searching for the chimi app that came with the cream cheese for a while. I wasn't disappointed! They were crispy and cooked perfect.  The jalape√±o cream cheese was what I was craving.  Since it was my first time, thought I'd play it safe with enchiladas. I ordered the 2 items with rice n beans. I chose the chicken enchi and beef enchi. I was impressed!  The sauce was what I was hoping for. I'm glad I found this place. I don't see myself eating here in the heat of Summer but I can definitely see myself getting it to-go. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE service. I've never had a Mexican food restaurant be sooooo stingy with salsa and so rude. Even the manager was terrible when it came to customer service. You are in the business of serving food and making it an enjoyable dining experience for your customers. When we purchase a pint of salsa because we know you are stingy with your salsa, that doesn't revoke the customers right to salsa with their large meal they just paid for. I can only assume you're being so stingy because your business is doing so poorly. Why don't you consider improving your customer service for starters."}
{"text":"Very good little take-out, diner specializing in Mexican fare.  The prices are reasonable and the food is delicious!  The serving sizes are also large so plan on leftovers.  They bring ample chips & salsa and while the salsa is not the best I've had, the chips are warm and I assume made in-house.  
I get the Carnitas (pork) which is about $12 for the dinner"}
{"text":"A great place to get some excellent Mexican food in a casual setting.  You order at the counter and the food is delivered to you table.  We had lunch there on a Saturday and the place was hopping.  Excellent food and service.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"After spending the day with my friend Austin, we were starving and came here for lunch.  I've never been here before, and or my first time, I have to say it was pretty darn good.

Upon entering, there's two Julios....we went to the smaller one that seems to be more of a fast casual type setting....self serve nachos, fountian pop, and you place your order at the counter.  The other julios is more of a sit down resturant with servers...we wanted a more casual dining experience, so we kept it to Julio toos.

I went with the Burro enchilada with shredded beef, rice and refried beans.  Prices here were awesome, and I got a ton of food.  Austin went with the mini chimi's, and I tried a few and they were tasty!!!  yummy.

I have enough leftovers for dinner, and was quite full after finishing my meal here at lunch time.   Place is small, well decorated, has an outdoor patio and a wide variety of menu items to choose from.

  Will be back in the future for more."}
{"text":"They are always tip notch. Great food and awesome service! They go above and beyond always with bringing food to your table, giving extra chips and salsa when you need. I love the pollo magnefico! It's amazing! Chicken chimichanga with jalape√±o cream cheese and shredded cheese on top. Also love that they have orange blossom beer. Come here! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"While I don't quite agree with everything Colin S has to say he essentially sums up Julio's Too. It's horrible. I ordered the veggie burrito, now you don't have to. It is disgusting. Don't bother with the salsa, It comes from a jar. You would have to be really wasted to actually eat here and think it is anything but hideous. Colin S is also correct on the parking. The lot was full but there was no one in the restaurant. One of the worst Mexican restaurants I have had the misfortune of dining at."}
{"text":"Fantastic take out Mexican food! 

Whenever we want quick and quality take out Mexican food we come here. They have delicious food, friendly service, reasonable prices, and healthy portion sizes. 

Everything on the menu is good, but my favorites are the mini chimis (cream cheese sauce is amazing), pork green chili, shredded beef tacos, flautas, and their chimichangas (oh...they are giant and glorious)!  They also have old fashioned sodas, beer, and margaritas to go along with your chips and salsa. Their salsas are excellent, and if you mix the hot with the mild the blend is magical. My only knock on them is that their chips are mediocre at best. Normally I judge a place based on their chips, but in this case the rest of the food makes up for the lack of chip flavor.

If you are in old town Scottsdale with a yen for mex or if you just want a quick take out check it Julios Too!"}
{"text":"Ok food but the service is horrific. Disinterested counter staff made for interesting watching during our meal. Watched staff at counter put customers on phone on hold to count his tip money. Ridiculous. Where is the manager?"}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat if you like Mexican. Food. Delicious free chips and salsa. My favorite is the jalape√±o cream cheese chicken chimmy conga and the cheese enchiladas are just the best"}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of Mexican food because I have dietary restrictions. However Julio's too has amazing food! The staff is so kind and very accompanying to my special orders. The food is always perfect, and I definitely think it is worth every penny!!"}
{"text":"The guy who answers the phone and runs the counter here is a complete jackass with absolutely no customer service skills whatsoever. He is rude, condescending and dismissive. Three times now in three separate occasions he has talked me out of ordering take out stating ridiculously  long wait times. I like the food here but this guy has talked me out of dining in or ordering take out for the last time. I will not go back. Try Valle Luna instead."}
{"text":"Literally just ordered a Togo bean burrito & rice for $6.50 and I come home to eat it and there are hairs... plural ....hairs in my burrito. I manage a restaurant. I know stuff happens. It does. And I constantly make sure when accidents happen customers are comp'd/made happy at THEIR convenience. The person who answered the phone when I called to let them know @ the disgusting hairs said I could \"come in for a refund \". Well I ordered to go because I'm out and about and busy today. Why not credit back my card right now because I did not eat one single bite of that hair laced burrito? I need to inconvenience myself because your cooks aren't clean and put hair in my food? DISGUSTING - Disappointed & honestly it is the easiest order ever and you put hairs.... multiple in it. Not my job to come all the way back so you can make my order right."}
{"text":"The food was great. The staff was happy and gracious. Out of all the places I ate in my trip to AZ this was in the top ten. Simple good food."}
{"text":"We went to Julio's last weekend for the first time. It was Saturday night, so it was pretty busy. We ended up getting a table in the bar. While our server was nice, we got basically no attention at all and had to flag down other servers and the manager to place our order, get refills, and pay our bill. Not impressed with that at all. 

Our food on the other hand, was very good. We had a very tasty selection of salsas, a stuffed chicken quesadilla, and beef fajitas. All of our selections were flavorful and exactly what we would have expected.

So despite some unimpressive service, I do believe we will go back to Julio's and give it a second chance."}
{"text":"I was bummed when they closed the original Julio's on Indian School. Anyway, I finally went in here recently to discover it's not just take out - they actually have tables and lower prices - awesome Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. Please know the Julio's on Tatum isn't owned by the same wonderful people as the one on camelback. There a difference in food and service. Don't waste time in going to the one on Tatum. We eat at least 2-3 times a week when we're in Arizona. Best Mexican food around!!! Great staff and wonderful owners!!"}
{"text":"I eat here just about every weekend before work. Everything i get is great, especially the beef mini chimis. And The people that work there are always super friendly!"}
{"text":"Good, fast and inexpensive Mexican food."}
{"text":"Awesome, local restaurant with solid food at a great time. The staff here is fantastic. Have been there for years and are very friendly. Julio's is a long time classic."}
{"text":"Horrible. The only reason for two stars is because the staff is nice and the food did not make me throw up (yet). Bland glop. Poor quality food. Sugary tomato sauce on the enchilada. Bland glop is the best I can say. Hubs had pork that was fatty and bland. I had enchilada that was weirdly sweet and gloppy and bland. Gross. Never again."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and get the Carne Asada dinner plate ($9). Here is what it includes:

-two carne Asada tacos the size of Texas
-a huge plate of beans and rice that could feed a family
-fresh tortilla chips with salsa fo freeee
-guac (not extra like chipotle!) and sour cream

*also they have $2 Margs if you want to turn up. 

The fajitas and chimichanga are also bomb.com. My dad actually was like why did u spend so much money on food and was shocked two entres cost less than $20. Gotta love AZ food prices"}
{"text":"Meh.  Not bad, just kind of bland.

We've been here a couple times. The portions a big but the quality is mediocre.  There are plenty of Mexican restaurants in the area where you can get just as much food but with more flavor."}
{"text":"I used to work near here and we got take out a lot. 

My favorites: spinach enchiladas, green corn tamale, chicken mini chimis ( they come with a green chile cream cheese dip, OMG). 

I loved their tex mex spin, not authentic Mexican, mind you, but tasty. 

I can't speak to the service, I rarely went in to pick up, even... I'm one of those crafty people who can get others to do that, lol. 

I liked it though."}
{"text":"Julio's Too is the take out counterpart to Julio G's, which is a very consistent 4 stars. This take out side has more of a concession stand vibe, but also has a few tables should you want to order something and eat it there without getting the full experience next door. 

I really love Julio G's Pollo Diablo, so I ordered that to go. We also got a cheese quesadilla and French fries... yes I know. Why would you ever get fries from a Mexican restaurant? Well as expected, they weren't so great. Not worth it even if you think it will cure your craving. The cheese quesadilla was fine and the pollo diablo was good, but just not quite as good as the version served next door. Of course, being takeout, some of the effect is lost once you finally get home and dig in, not to mention the warmth. This is not Julio Too's fault though, that's just take out 101. 

We got a bag to fill with chips and some salsa as well. Crispy but definitely not as warm or fresh like the sit down version of Julio's. Overall, if you are craving Julio's but need to get take out, this is a nice easy set up to get your food to go. Otherwise, I recommend just popping next door for the full experience!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! There is not one item that I did not like. 
We can here with the entire family. They set us up outside and constantly checked on us to make sure we were taken care of. Everyone was extremely nice and courteous. 
If you are in the area try this place out. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Today was our first experience at the Restaurant.
 We knew that it would be a home run when we were greeted by Ron the manager.  We told him that we were first time customers. He spent at least ten minutes at our table suggesting different dishes on the menu.  So we would be ready for Bill our server.
Who was spot on.

We also met Don an old timer at the restaurant.

Great dining experience, everyone is so friendly. It is like a neighborhood hangout. 
From the girl who delivered our chips and salsa. To the girl who delivered the shot of Tequila. 

We will definitely be back to see Bill and the gang.

Very surprised to see negative reviews."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food and drinks. The tortilla soup is amazing!  We really like tortilla soup and they have one of the best ones we've ever tasted. They rest of our food was delicious too."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service.  The manager lacks customer service skills and does not know how to speak to customers.  I've been a customer for 18yrs. I will not be"}
{"text":"Best green corn tamales around. Great for takeout - small indoor and patio seating for dining in. Super casual ambiance, fantastic lunch specials, extremely good food and beyond reasonable prices. Fresh hot chips are always included with your order and beer/margaritas are available here as well.
I understand they do a large amount of catering and have always wowed customers with exceptional service.
This location had been in the heart of Old Town for as long as I can recall and I've never been disappointed. A must for anyone in the area."}
{"text":"For local fast food style Mexican, Julio's is not bad. The chips and salsa were fresh, but a bit greasy. The fajita salad was good, with decent chicken, and a fried tortilla bowl. The tamale was huge, not the best I've had, but definitely edible. However the flan was horrible - very hard and spongey, but I wasn't expecting too much from fast food. I mean, it's certainly not healthy or authentic Mexican but it's a step up from Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Solid take out option in old town.   Salsa is great and the chips are really nice.  I generally do not go in for the hard shell tacos but at this joint it is worth the extra calories.  If planning to host a game or a party, this is a good option. 

The open at 11 so games that start on Sundays have a disconnect with timing food and football."}
{"text":"Ordered take out last night. I got chicken fajitas and a kids meal for my little one. They give you a bunch of chips and salsa to go and the food was amazing  can't wait to dine in sometime!"}
{"text":"I used to have this anorexic friend.  She would join us girls for dinner sometimes.  She would never order anything of course, and when the food would come she would squirm in her seat, roll her eyes and say, \"Are you seriously going to eat that?\". When I took the lid off my Julio's Too take out, I had a flash back of my anorexic friend and I thought, \"I'm not sure this time.\". 

I'm from Texas.  I know TexMex and I love it.  No offense, to the other Yelpers who have used the term, but this is not TexMex.  This is more like a Mexi-Mess!  I ordered the chili relleno and green chili corn tamale which was presented in a foil tin mixed with refried beans and rice.  I'll give them credit for the beans and rice.  That was good, but the rest...hmmmm.  The chili relleno was drowned in a glob of greasy cheese.  I'm not trying to say, that the chili relleno is the healthy choice.  It's breaded and sometimes fried.  It is never soggy or submerged in goo...unless you order from Julio's Too.  As for the green chili tamale.  In Texas, tamales are much smaller.  The corn (or maize as they say) is much more understated allowing the filling to really stand out.  This tamale was like a men's size 12 corn shoe with a little bit if cheese and green chili inside.  It was also, encased in a tomb of cheese that I had to dig through before I finally found the tamale.

I won't go in to the salsa.  The other Yelpers got it right.  

Now, I do like the location, the vibe and the service.  I would ride my bike over there for chips and guacamole with friends.  They have a convenience store selection of beverages and a nice patio, which merit an extra star.

I'm not trying to be a jerk with this review, but this is just what I think."}
{"text":"First time here--glad we came!  Free chips and salsa (always a great start to a Mexican meal!).  Hubby and I split the chicken fajitas, which were very tasty!  Good-sized portion with lots of red bell peppers, which we like. Served with side of rice and beans, guac, sour cream, and pico de gallo.  We each ate our fill and still had enough for a take-home 'fajita burrito' :D"}
{"text":"Pretty good Mexican food. It's nice that they provide free chips & salsa before your meal, even though it's a casual counter service taco shop. Spinach enchilada makes a nice vegetarian choice. Generous portions & affordable prices. Friendly, prompt service. Fine, fine place to grab a quick bite but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"Refused to serve family of 10 that drove 15 miles because of the stupid super bowl? You get one star, never coming back..."}
{"text":"Good Fresh authentic Mexican food....good prices, Great service....first time here and I will be coming back for sure.....and you get free fresh Chips with every order!!!! Great customer service also!!!"}
{"text":"I ask what there isn't to like about this particular Julio's Too? For my entire adolescence I searched and searched for a tex-mex style restaurant in my hometown area... but alas found nothing. It wasn't until aught nine that I discovered this magnificent shrine to tasteful eats. 

Family owned and operated, Julio's provides a warm and friendly environment for the casual diner. The menu is simple yet diverse with plate combinations and creations that are not so easy to find in the sonoran style valley. Looking for  recommendation? Try the Green Chile Relleno plate with a side of love from full timer Steve Rosa. Want  a burrito, well they come in size BIG at Julio's and full of all kinds of fresh ingredients. Need I mention how delicious the FREE chips and salsa are with every meal purchased? And with a handful of good friends the restaurant can quickly turn into a wonderfully amusing adventure into the land great food. All in all, I highly recommend stopping by and not just getting a meal, but maybe making a friend or two at the four stool bar section... I know I have!

xo,
Josie"}

{"text":"Eh, not bad, not great! Not a fan of Mexican food anyway unless it is authentic and I am at Gallo Blanco, Frank and Lupe's, or Barrio Cafe. However, that said, this place is not so bad. Cheap and lots of food. When in Scottsdale and you are desperate for a late dinner after visiting the bar scene check it out. I liked their sit down restaurant once upon a time but they closed their doors. This is what's left. It reminds me of a school lunch cafeteria in a way. lol! Hey I ate here last night with my guy and you know what? I actually really liked the Chili Rellenos and their sauces. I am very picky about salsas and sauces from all the Mexican restaurants I worked at over the years. Their hot sauce is really good."}
{"text":"Two words: Fat Mac. I get why Mac was eating Chimichangas so much. Before coming to Julio's I never had Chimichangas, and wow, I totes get why Mac had them all the time. They are delicious, along with every single thing on the Julio's menu.

The people there are the polite incarnate. They would probably have a funeral for a bird or something. Probably one they don't even know like a raven, or even a pigeon - the rats of the sky. More importantly, whenever I go to have Julio's I have such a good time with their food. The first time I went with a real homie and I got the \"Pollo Magnifico.\" Good doesn't quite capture it. My heart skipped so many beats I developed a heart murmur. 

It has a bit of a retro vibe too. It's like if Pulp Fiction was shot within a Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale flair. Except for the busier times, say the weekends, you can always get a seat and your food quite fast. 

Every other time after that was a bad experience, not because of Julio's, they were always perfect, but because I tried to introduce possible love interests to this place. I guess there were other things going on that made those relationships not work, but the fait accompli in my mind was that they didn't like Julio's. I mean just because we had dinner somewhere else before why can't you get another snack? You gotta always have room for Julio's.

Through breakups, the woes of relationships, and the bliss of love, Julio's is gonna have your back and always be delish. Stay up fam. Get in there and get a Chimichanga."}
