{"text":"I would give it a higher rating. However, their customer service is terrible. I go casually, usually dont get ID'D. But there has been times where I have been I'D'D, and unfortunately I only had a temporary licence as I renewed it. Additionally I had further confirmation  that I am \"of age\". I showed her my temporary licence along with my alberta health care and My visa card. She refused to even listen, and pertended to \"talk to the manager\". Completley terrible service considering this was the same waitress (the bigger brown girl) who didnt ID me the last few times I went there. I also told her that I wouldnt drink I just wanted to eat..she still turned me down. Sucks for the boss to have such negative employers! ... Otherwise, the food is great."}
{"text":"I've been to the Tudor Rose twice now.  First time with a group of friends redeeming groupons and once with a good friend. 

Both times the service was prompt and efficient and the food quite good. 

So far I've tried the Lamb Shank(at the serving staff's suggestion) and while it was flavourful and well presented, the overall dish was lukewarm. I didn't see the point in complaining about it as it was such a minor issue and I'd probably order it again.

On the other visit I tried their coconut battered fish and chips.  This dish impressed me.  The fish was a generous portion and the batter was amazing.  I had a hard time not ordering something else when I came back for another visit. 

Definitely a place I'll return to, good food, good service and their draught beers are well priced.

{"text":"I think the good is pretty good for the price and the service is decent. Pub style food but they do show on their menu the healthy options etc.
Nothing special but it does seem to get fairly busy as the night goes on so if your table picky-come earlier. 

I do hear the Beer Battered Chicken Fingers are the best."}
{"text":"I gotta say, normally week one in a new pub is a disaster but Tudor Rose has put it all together.  They had the local Big Rock on special, the hot wings were spiced right and meaty, the calamari was also tasty.  The strongbow hasn't made it in yet, but I'm sure that is a matter of days.  The bathroom fixtures could use a little hands free action for a new pub but that is minor.  The wait staff was friendly and very attentive, indicative that they hired some young professionals.  This is the local pub that Panorama Hills needed and it's design certainly fits the community."}
{"text":"Finally a decent pub around here. We make an effort to go as much as we can because we love everything about it... food, drinks, service, atmosphere."}
{"text":"OK.... so there was a Groupon coupon for this place and i thought i would give it one more try, it has been months since it opened  and it is sooo close to my house.

Well the staff has always been good, and now i can say the food is .. well dam good. I did not get a burger this time but the descriptions in the menu changed to a Kaiser bun.... that is a HUGE plus!! i saw a burger go buy and it looked very very good!!!!! 
 No I gout the Chicken club and my wife got the chicken wrap,
 First THE POP IS NOW FREE REFILLS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
that was the first thing  i asked!!!  

Ok the fries... WOW they are now the crispy type, they were cooked golden and just the right way, and sooo good.... my wife and i loved them!!

my chicken club was on a nice Kaiser bun the bacon was thick and good, the lettuce was crisp and the tomato was fresh and red, 
the chicken was grilled soo well it had nice charred edges and was  plump and juicy  , seasoned just right!   

My wife enjoyed the wrap and same her chicken was plump and jusy strips.. with crisp  lettuce and ripe tomato, the pita was fresh and warm.

 we both cleaned out plates,  every fries gone, and they did give a large amount of fries. All the way to the crisp Pickle on the side.

So i am happy that  they decided to use Groupon because i would not have considered going back.. and im glade i did!!!!! i is now a great neighbored pub that serves GREAT food, i will try the burgers again next time im there.

So everyone in the NW and in Panorama get over there!!!"}
{"text":"Decent, but nothing special. Nice decor and attempted feeling of a European style pub, but something falls short. Service has been fine and it was busy both times I was there. 

Overall, reliable yet unremarkable."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant! There is a tv in every booth which was something i had never seen before.
Our group was out on the patio, the patio is quite large with very comfy ratan chairs.
I had the fajita salad with steak. It was amazing! Very large portions. It came in an edible tortilla bowl with guacamole dressing. I would definitely recommend! 
The food came fast and the service was amazing especially considering the size of our group.
Also saturday is \"ladies night\" $5.25 mixed smirnoff drinks.
A great place, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Honestly never thought I would find myself this far north in Calgary, but here I was on a Thursday evening having beers and dinner with friends. The establishment has a nice modern pub look to it. I liked the fact that the booths had there own TVs. Clearly this is a sporty-type of place, so it isn't for everyone. And while there was nothing special about the food, Big Rock was on special for $4.95 a pint. Not bad. 

One of my friends had trouble with their burger. The grease was so heavy that it soaked the bun. They handled it immediately though. The service was good.  Lots of TVs here so if you want to catch the NBA/NHL finals somewhere the drinks are reasonably priced, this would be an ideal place."}
{"text":"We got here in time for a brunch special on a Saturday just after lunchtime. I think there were only about 3 other tables eating at the time. We both ordered BLT's with yam fries and it took foreverrr!  Why???  The restaurant was certainly not busy and our order was a simple one.  Well when our food arrived it was good, but the bread was a little stale, and the yam fries were a little over cooked (although I didn't really mind that). 
  I guess I'd suggest you maybe just come here for the drinks!"}
{"text":"I was visiting my friend in Panorama Hills and she suggested we go to 'the awesome pub next door'. And that is how I found myself at Tudor Rose. I have not been to many 'neighbourhood pubs' in the suburbs, or boonies, as I like to call them, so I wasnt sure what to expect. But it was fairly good, but did feel a bit suburb-ish. 

Very large place. Big doors, high ceilings, lots of space.. y'know, everything that suburbians love about the suburbs. Okay okay, I'll stop. The service was quite good. But it could have been because I was with a friend who demanded attention, who would not let a waitress pass by without making her turn around and listen to her request before moving on to other customers. Anyway, the pizza we ordered was good too! It was large and delicious. I took some home. 

So yeah, if you're in Panorama Hills or somewhere equally far-removed north of the core, check out Tudor Rose. Pretty decent place to catch a game or eat pizza or drink a beer... or whatever else suburbians like to do.

{"text":"A group of friends & I came out here on a Saturday night to celebrate our birthdays. The place got really busy over the course of the night. We had a fairly large table and our waitress was always there with fresh drinks. This was some of the best service I've had anywhere in town. 

We all ordered food and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised at how good it is, considering the menu is rather English pub fare, which I'm not terribly fond of. I had the southwest chicken salad which came in a homemade fried tortilla bowl. It was really good. I also tried some of my friend's sweet potato fries. Those were really good too. Some of the other food choices were the nacho platter (it was BIG) and the cobb salad (also big and had fresh bacon on it - who doesn't love bacon???) Everyone said they enjoyed their food. 

Tudor Rose is pretty cool inside. I'd say it's more geared toward the sports fan as they have flat screen tv's everywhere including one per table (on the wall in each booth). That's something I've never seen before. The place is bigger than I expected and has an inviting feel to it. Not intimidating for those of us who aren't sports obsessed men. When I went to bathroom, I passed by a couple of guys playing some kind of interactive golf game. Guess they have a few of those things here too. 

Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone who's up in that neighborhood. Good food and outstanding service. Can't beat it!"}
{"text":"We had wanted to try this place out and it happened to be a Thursday, a jolly good pub night one may say...!
Walked in and it was quite loud, as expected. It was moderately busy but we were able to find a booth and planted ourselves down after a long day. The flat screens built into the ends of the booth were a nice touch. I also liked that the Specials were on the table in small menu form and every single day of the week has something going on. Grasshopper pints were on sale for the Man and we noted that Thurs was also pizza night! Perfect. A 2 topping pizza for $6.99. The late night menu comes out after 10pm which still has a lot on it to choose from. We were also given a regular menu to look at just to see the variety of dishes they have for lunch and dinner. Note - no curry dishes - they had tried that and that did not fly but you will find all the other typical English pub dishes.
We were offered to try Fruili which I believe is a German style sweet beer that is made with a ton of real strawberries. It even came pink in the glass! That was neat even for me to try as I am not a beer drinker, I did stick with my Vodka/Crans! For sure a gal's beer or the guys I am told mix it with Strong Bow or Guinness and that has become a House fave!
The pizza came out Artisan style with that less than perfect round crust (loved that!) and we dove right into our bacon and mushroom Za. Not bad at all. The bacon was real, wish there had been more on there but for $6.99, a great deal. Even the cheese was good and stringy, it for sure passed my cheese test! The dough was good and it was cooked perfectly.
We had told our server Ashley that it was our first time at Tudor and she gave me a tour of the patio which was really nice looking with the beams and fireplace, very classy. She explained that there was a big private room in the back beyond the curtains saved for special events. She was a great waitress and it was a nice change to have found great service in someone who took a lot of pride in her job!
I liked the fact that the pub was large and airy, had a lot of wood going on and had a new, clean feeling to it. It has been open maybe for 2 years. Music was good, Top 40, not too loud. 
Back to the food...
The pizza was not enough for us so we dove into an order of 3 mini-sliders which miniaturizes the 3 burgers they have on the reg. menu so you can choose your fave - British burger (mmm that warm homemade BBQ sauce! And bacon!), the Tudor burger (basic) and then the Mexi burger (covered in jalapenos). All deelish! Mexi won out for both of us but just by a teeny bit over the Brit burger. The meat was sooo tender! Almost everything on the menu is homemade, all the desserts are too!
We will for sure be back, Sundays have the Fish and Chip Special, apparently very popular days for eating. Friday and Saturday nights I am told are very busy for drinking! But of course!"}
{"text":"Food: 3.5/5
Atmosphere: 3.5/5
Service: 3/5
Overall experience: 3.5/5

(1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)

I've been here a few times and the experiences have been fairly well. I've only had one really bad experience where the service was extremely slow and the dish I ordered was terrible. However, all in all Tudor is a nice pub to hang out with friends. It has a relaxed, rustic British pub feel to it with a beautiful decor of hardwoods and cushy booths with their own tvs. It's a fairly large pub that isn't too overcrowded. 

Alcohol selection is a little limited but decently priced at round $6 pint for beer. The House lager is cheap with a light crisp flavour. Unlike half the pubs I've been to, the food here is pretty good. It consists of your usual pub fair along with sandwiches/burgers, pizza, steak, pasta, traditional British dishes all for a decent price (from $10-20). I highly suggest you try their traditional poutine. At only $8, it's one of the best poutines I've had in Calgary. The fries are extra crispy, but not overcooked, the gravy is not overly salty, and there is plenty of cheese curds oozing throughout the poutine.

Their wing nights are on Wednesday for $0.35 and they came out piping hot and fresh from my last two experiences. I enjoy their sandwiches as they are fresh and flavourful! I've had the Hot Italian Meatloaf Sandwich ($10.95) with homemade meatloaf served over fresh bread with a rich red wine gravy. If you like meatloaf this is a pretty hearty dish. I especially enjoyed their Hot Italian Sausage Sub ($10.95) with home made spiced sausage nestled in a perfectly toasted baguette with a light tangy sauce, onions and peppers.

I suggest you avoid their ribs and bbq chicken (about $17). Although their ribs are huge, they are really fatty and bland and the chicken was dry. The BBQ sauce is nothing special.

The service is up and down. It's nothing extraordinary and if you're unlucky sometimes the service can be extremely bad and slow on the weekends or during a 'specials' night.

Overall this is a great pub to visit for warm comforting food and drinks in a relaxed atmosphere. I suggest a visit if you live in the area!"}
{"text":"Take everything you know about a suburban pub and... well, it's exactly that...
That said there are a few things that make Tudor Rose special. If you feel like hanging out with friends, there's plenty of room. Come play a game of pool and chances are there will be enough seating for everyone.

They've got a sunny, south facing patio to put back some pints on. For beer, they've got your basic domestic big boys, but are also carrying Goose Island, Molson's response to craft beer. 

Try the chicken burger - it's a solid, juicy chicken breast that comes in three different spices. I went with the blackened chicken and loved it. The greek salad is also well worth paying a little more for."}
{"text":"So several of us took advantage of the Tuesday all you can eat beef ribs special ($13.99).  It comes with 3 ribs and fries to start, and you can have refills on the ribs thereafter.  The ribs have some meat on them, although a bit less than the beef ribs on the regular menu (which I love).  The ayce ribs were on the dry side and is covered with way too much sauce.  I had a refill of ribs after finishing the first plate and the quality is about the same (maybe a little less visually appealing) as the ribs that came initially.  Overall, I am a bit disappointed in the ayce ribs... it just didn't taste good.  My friends all said that we will find a better place next time... sad."}
{"text":"I liked the interior of the Pub. Its comforting and not overly loud. Has pool tables and video golf game on the side for their customers.  Service was ok. came to table to take order and to give the bill, otherwise we  had to look for her to give us drinks.   I was not happy with my sliders. Patties were so hard that even knives werent cutting them properly. Enjoyed their potato chips and Basa fish and chips."}
{"text":"It took a hour to get our food because the waitress forgot to put in the order, her excuse was she is usually bartending not waitressing. It took awhile to get drinks to, I'd finish a drink and it would sit there empty for a good 15 minutes. When the food finally arrived my friends eggs, over easy, were undercooked, way to runny. I'm celiac which I told them but I ended up getting very ill and the food tasted like garbage anyways I didn't have very much of it. 

They ended giving us our meals for free and just charged us for drinks."}
{"text":"When this place first opened, the food was great and service was awesome.  Since then, it's consistently gone down hill.  Gradually getting worse and worse every time we go.  I don't remember the last time we really enjoyed the food.  

Our last visit was for Mother's Day brunch. We booked a reservation and arrived on time.  They sat us at a partially clean table and the drinks and service was extremely slow.  The brunch didn't have many options and i had to chase or ask many servers for cutlery...and when it arrived, they only gave us 2 napkins for 8 people.  Very unorganized."}
{"text":"First time here with some coworkers celebrating a birthday.  Service was good...no complaints there.  Our group had several different items throughout the evening...chicken wings, calamari, french fries, quesadillas, and a chicken caesar salad to name a few.  The food arrived hot and was really good.

We loved that they have 21 different beers on tap - yum!!  The atmosphere was nice and the music was not so loud you couldn't hear your friends chat.

We really enjoyed our evening here...a nice little neighbourhood pub that is not too far out of the way.  We will return!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try Tudor Rose again, as I haven't been here since it first opened (and even then, only for drinks). It was Thursday and girls night with Raissa R., which ended up working out perfectly as Smirnoff Flavoured vodka was on for $4.50. We're off to a great start!!

Because I was really looking forward to our meal here, I had already checked out the menu online beforehand. It's HUGE, tons of options and a wide variety of things to eat. We started with the baked brie. Heavenly! It came baked inside a puff pastry, with crackers, grilled apples, and grapes on the side. I love apples with my cheese and it was so nice to have something other than JUST cheese and crackers to nibble (which is the case for a lot of restaurants).  

Unfortunately, that was the highlight of our meal. I decided on the coconut fish and chips and my girlfriend had the burger. Everything came out really quickly and hot, I was so excited but honestly the dish fell flat - the batter was not light and crispy as I expected, but tasted as if it had been cooked from frozen. I could hardly detect coconut, and the pineapple sauce served on the side was inedible. Not to mention the actual piece of fish tasted off - not bad - but just different. Again, it was as if it was cooked from frozen and I have actually cooked frozen fish that tasted better than this. The fries were delicious though. I did have a few bites of my friends burger, and while it was tasty (hard to screw up a burger!), she did comment that it lacked flavor and was somewhat bland.

Because of the awesome drink specials and the overall atmosphere of this place (love the TV's in the booths), I will come back and give it another try. Our server was excellent and the prices were decent. Here's hoping next time is better & I can update this review."}
{"text":"Lots of TVs even in the booths!
Food is ok. They have Fruili (which I liked).
Service was good."}
{"text":"Steak ordered medium. Blood rare. Took server 10 mins to check to send it back...
Now still waiting...
Oh well I'll have one more expensive beer..."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try since we where looking for a pub to have a drink after a long week and some dinner.
The décor is very well done and I like the dark wood and atmosphere.  The place was pretty busy and we decided to sit by the pool tables so my husband could watch the pool game.  
Our server was prompt and polite, she took our drink order right away.  However the food I have to say was just ok.  Now I was comparing to a few other \"Irish\" style pups that I've been to in the area.  It was a typical menu with ribs, wings, nachos, waffle nachos, burgers and the stews and fish and chips.  
Unlike our drinks the food took a little longer than I had expected to show up at our table.  
I had the BBQ pork ribs with baked potato.  They were tasty and well flavored, they fell off the bone and was a decent portion.  My husband had the liver and onions, which was a huge portion of liver.  Now the food tasted good but it just didn't have that wow factor is all.  All I had on my plate was ribs and potato...kind of blah looking  presentation.  My husbands plate was similar with liver covered in so much gravy, well let just say I hate liver, and I could eat it with that much gravy.  He had a few veggies but again it was just kind of missing some flair.   
That all being said, I'd go back and give this place another go to see if maybe it was just an off night."}
{"text":"The food is decent but every time I seem to go there they are understaffed and unorganized. Went for wings and there was only one person on running around the place. I understand sometimes it gets busy and takes a bit longer to get service but in this case it was not even that busy in there. She did apologize which was appreciated but they should really schedule better or get more staff."}
{"text":"This place is a mere few minutes from my place and me and one of my girls decided to try it out for lunch the other day.

It is your typical pub, lotsa wood, lotsa tv's, lotsa blue collar guys...you get the picture.  

The menu is extensive and offers your typical pub fare; salads, burgers, sandwiches, steak, pizza and pasta.  It was nice to have such a large selection but I didn't think it was necessary, really.  Not ravenous, I decided on the tropical pizza.  It was good, not the best I've ever had, the sauce was a bit on the bitter side but the pizza itself was very fresh and crispy.  

My friend had a salad with grilled chicken.  She thoroughly enjoyed it.  Large portion with a nicely grilled garlic baguette on the side.

Waitress was friendly and the restaurant itself was immaculately clean, which is why I give them a solid 3.5.  

Not a big drinker myself, I can't comment on their booze selections but their bar was huge.

Great neighbourhood pub that I will probably hit up again with the man.  Prices are reasonable too.

Enjoy."}
