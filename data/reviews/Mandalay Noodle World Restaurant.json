{"text":"Small place, former fast food joint. Service is good, food is amazing, It's cheap and fast and really tasty. Don't go here if you are looking for something fancy but if you want good food and good prices, it's perfect."}
{"text":"I love this place. Love the pad thai too... I ask for it spicy hot, then add the chili oil w crushed red pepper. Sooo delicious."}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant we had a coupon for so we went for it. It was fairly empty inside but after reading great reviews on Yelp, felt confident we'd have a good experience. I can't stress enough that the service here was incredible. We felt like they went out of their way to give us the best experience and made us feel very welcome. Since some of the menu was a little unfamiliar to us, the waiter jumped at the opportunity to help us make some selections. We had some type of spring roll/egg roll appetizer...wow! These were soooo fresh! I guess I never realized what a fresh spring roll was until I ate here. It was steaming hot, extremely crispy, and STUFFED with fresh vegetables! OMG! Out of this world! I would go back just for these. We also tried their won ton soup. This broth wasn't clear like we expected...it was a brown broth and was more flavorful than any other won ton soup. It was huge and very delicious! Fresh veggies and yummy won tons (so I'm told by my boyfriend, the won tons had meat in them so I had to skip past those). Both of our noodle dishes were very fresh, the waiter actually came out before they started cooking to check to see how I would like my tofu prepared. We weren't in line with these flavors...the noodle dishes were a little less flavorful than we were expecting after our earlier courses. They were good, just seemed like they were lacking a little something. We will probably go back, for soup and rolls...and maybe to try different entrees. Overall, pretty good."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to checking this place out, but I (we) were left severely disappointed.

I ordered the nangyi, which is supposed to be a cold dish per the menu.  Only a few bites into it did I come to the realization that my dish was actually very warm/hot.  I asked the waitress if they had brought me the wrong dish, and she said that the chicken was cold, but that the noodles warmed up the dish.  Since there were only a few tiny strands of chicken in the dish (more on the chicken later...), I guess that makes sense - but why state on the menu that its a cold dish when it comes out *almost* piping hot?  I was also dismayed, while my mom laughed, that the noodles were spaghetti noodles.  The cherry on top was the generous amount of fried wonton skins scattered throughout the dish.  I hypothesized that my very warm cold dish of spaghetti rice noodles, chicken strands, and Fritos would taste better after being microwaved, so I packed it up.  I hope I'm right.

My friends ordered a pho-type dish and a beef chow fun-type dish.  The pho was ordered non-spicy, but it still came out spicy.  I think it was an unanimous decision that the beef chow fun-y dish was the best, but then I'd rather just go to a Chinese restaurant and get the real thing.

My mom ordered the burmese curry with chicken, and although the taste was alright to me, the chicken was not alright to anyone.  You see, the chicken was overcooked in both chicken dishes.  Like overcooked and left out for a long period of time.  When we mentioned it to the waitress, she at first said sorry and walked off without another word.  She came back a few moments later and asked if they could make a new curry for her free of charge.  It usually comes across in a better light if you do that before you walk off rather than after.  My mom opted to get another beef chow fun-y dish instead.

We also got hot tea, but both times the tea pot was refilled, the water was lukewarm at best.  Lukewarm, flavorless tea is no way to drink tea, dawg.

Another friend came in when we were done and asked how it was, since it was his first time there also.  I hope his dinner was much better than ours."}
{"text":"we can't stay away from this place!

just got home from a delightful lunch. again, i ordered the beef noodle soup, just as delicious as the first time! Matthew got the chicken fried rice (fanTASTIC) with an eggroll. i hate eggrolls generally and i would order 3 of them! so good, you can tell fresh ingredients are used and we were actually told by our server that they don't even make it until it's ordered. i like that. i like that A LOT.

we had the same server as before, i need to get his name because he is just awesome. he remembered us AND what we ordered, and seemed much more confident today, that made us happy too.

there were 5 tables seated when we got there, so at least people are going in and trying this place.  i hope they tell all of their friends, because this restaurant NEEDS to stick around!

oh, and both times our bill with drinks was under $25.00 WITH tip (a good tip, not a stingy one), another thing that's awesome about this place."}
{"text":"In this world where everyone's experiences end up on the net, this place needs to get with the program. We love good AUTHENTIC Asian food, so their \"Favorite Chinese\" dish section did not appeal to us. Orange chicken is not Chinese food, seriously. The Burmese/Thai section of the menu, however, really interested us. We chose 4 items from this section of the menu. When we ordered, we were informed that 2 of the items we had ordered were not available as they were out of both kinds of rice noodle. We substituted for the tom ka soup and a papaya salad. We also had pad Thai with shrimp (for the kids) and a Burmese chicken curry. 

The soup came out first and I knew immediately that it didn't have coconut milk. I mentioned it to the server when he asked how the soup was. He said, \"Yeah, I know, our chef is new.\" Uhhhhm okay, then why serve it that way? The soup tasted unfinished and lacked many of the flavors (i.e. lemon grass) I'm used to in a good tom ka gai. 

The pad Thai came out next. It was admittedly pretty darn good. The curry followed, but it took awhile for us to get to it, as the rice didn't accompany it. I asked about the papaya salad about 10 minutes after the other dishes had been served, but the server seemed annoyed and told me it was coming. The curry was on the yummy side. If you like white meat, this isn't for you. I can take an occasional foray into the dark side, so I liked it. 

When the long anticipated papaya salad came it was missing a few of its promised ingredients. I was unfamiliar with green papaya, so I had expected something a little sweet. A green papaya tastes a bit like zucchini. The tomato was on the pink side, never an excuse for that. If tomatoes are pink, they shouldn't be served. I was already full by the time this starter dish arrived. 

Water refills were promised, but not delivered until the end. The place was nearly empty on a Friday night. The server took 10 percent off for serving sub par soup. The proprietors should ask themselves why. Let me tell you why. 

1. Your server was a bit distracted. One customer was even getting his own drinks. I know he's your son, which makes it an easy fix! 

2. You weren't able to provide simple menu items and ingredients that could be purchased at Fry's. Seriously, you don't have to go to Lee Lee Market for rice vermicelli. 

3. The place still feels like a Jack in the Box. Renovate! 

4. Do what you do well and focus on the Burmese/Thai end of your business. You're the only Burmese game in town as far as I know. Lots of places have \"Chinese Favorites\" 

5. Don't make excuses 

6. Try to make people want to come back! Coupons and to go menus help."}
{"text":"i went to this \"Restaurant\" twice to many.its across the street from my work and thought id support a new business,i wished i hadnt.first the place is an old jack n box with Little renovation done.the dish portions were small.the prices were high,the service was slow.the first time i order a basil leave salad.and it came out.and what i saw was 2 spears of romaine lettuce with basically coos coos in the middle and oil on the bottom.,DISGUSTING.then i the next visit i paid 7 dollars for side coconut \"jumbo\"shrimp .BAD.i got 4 small super oily pieces that had no flavor and the beef lo mien was a whole other bad choice,DONT EVER GO THERE."}
{"text":"This place needs a lil work still.  After days of wanting noodles, my roomie and I stopped in to check-out their fare.  We ate in but kinda regretted that as the service, though polite, was slow and disorganized.  Maybe it's because we got there just as the dinner hour was starting but it seemed more like the server had no experience.  Normally, I don't expect service quality from an Asian joint but normally it's rude and fast. lol

So I ordered the Mandalay noodles and my roomie had a curry noodle something.  My noodles had good flavor and the shrimp was fresh and crisp... but there were only like 3 of them.  Really?  My roomies dish had good flavor.  

All-in-all, it was a disappointing experience.  I know it's new so I might try it again in a few months.  Hopefully at that time, the rating will go up thru the roof!

Might see ya there!"}
{"text":"Food was a bit greasy and the kid serving us was like 12 years old and bit forgetful.  I love the Asian noodle concept but they aren't able to pull it off that well since there food is just average.  I will try again just to be sure that this place is justified having 3 stars instead of 2."}
{"text":"Closed for good."}
{"text":"We visited again the other day. The service was the same--not unfriendly, but also not very attentive. The food, however, was not quite as good. Like many small restaurants, I assume that a lot depends on who the chef is that particular day. Still not bad though."}
{"text":"I got two lunch specials: Sweet & Sour Chicken and Beef Curry. At $6.95/special which includes rice and a spring roll. Pretty good! The pork was nice and moist and the beef curry was wonderfully tender. 

They forgot to include the spring roll, but I stopped back a few days later and picked them up."}
