{"text":"Buccis brick oven pizza is my favorite pizza, period. I have been to Italy and the pizza here is as good as any I had in Italy. Everything I have had from here reminds me of my trip to Italy. This is real Italian food..if Olive Garden is your favorite restaurant, I recommend you don't go here, because you will NEVER go back to Olive Garden."}
{"text":"When we pulled into the parking lot we had second thoughts. So happy we decided to go in. Our food and service were fantastic."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza. Hand tossed (open kitchen where you can see them tossing dough up in the air). Large size pizza are truly large. Fresh ingredients. Very good service. Our server offered to add fresh tomatoes and basil to mozzarella pizza. Very good! The owner recommended canolli which were good. Place was busy and prices were affordable. Had a feel of Italian eatery and American style family restaurant."}
{"text":"Double check your items on your bill please. Bucci's Brick Oven in Middleburg Hts. add their gratuity and to your bill don't mention it to you.  Great food and great service. But, as a courtesy to customers, wish they would mention that they already added the 20% gratuity to your bill. Almost didn't notice that. I double checked the bill because the total seemed a bit high priced for just 2 dinners with water and no appetizers, no cocktails and no dessert.  We're retired seniors and would not have been happy paying a double tip of 40% and would not ever return if that were the case. What if the service was not good? Don't we have a choice to tip accordingly? That's just not good business and not fair to customers. If that's your policy, please let the customer know."}
{"text":"Perfect pizza at a very reasonable price. Every ingredient was carefully selected  by the culinary geniuses in their kitchen, and then cooked in a wood fired stone oven. This is what pizza should always be like, but so rarely is. Thin crust with a nice chew, and only slightly kissed with the char that comes from cooking in a stone oven. Simple yet delicious tomato sauce with san marzanos, olive oil, and garlic. And a generous amount of lightly browned bubbling flavorful mozzarella. We also got sausage on top and it was perfect mild Italian sausage. My wife and I could only finish six of the eight large slices, so we brought the rest to my parents, and they agreed that it was some of the best pizza they have ever eaten. We have eaten the top rated pizzas from all over the Cleveland area, but had never been to Bucci's. We will be making the trip from the East Side of Cleveland again for the dine-in experience VERY SOON. We are so happy to have discovered this little gem, and will be recommending it to all of our friends and family."}
{"text":"Wait staff is a little clueless. Good pizza!  Customizing was no problem. House made Cavatelli pasta is outstanding. Bathrooms needed attention."}
{"text":"The food is always good here. Today was no different. The wait staff is always courteous and friendly, and today we got Britney. She is really a great waitress. I will ask for her from now on. She was really attentive to our needs, and observing her I noticed she was that way to all of her tables. She had about 6 tables. Kudos!"}
{"text":"Bucci's is an overall great restaurant. The food is always delicious, flavorful and a great portion. The specials are always a nice added touch. All of the food is authentic Italian food! It doesn't matter if you want take out or dine in, it is worth the money. Simple menu too."}
{"text":"Recently had lunch here with a friend to sample their brick oven pizza...glad we did!  We decided to split both a pizza and a salad.  We started off with the strawberry salad topped with a celery seed dressing.  I'm not usually a fan of this style of salad, but this version was quite good, an unexpected surprise!  The meal also came with fresh Italian bread on the side.  The margherita style brick oven pizza was just as you'd expect...simple but flavorful, with a perfectly browned crispy thin crust underneath.  The meal was priced a little on the high side (for lunch fare), but very filling and full of excellent flavors.  Glad we gave this place a try!"}
{"text":"The little strip mall Bucci's is set in almost scared us off, but man am I glad it didn't. The inside of the restaurant is warm and homey. The portions are more than generous and the pricing is good. Service has been awesome every time too.  The meatballs here cannot be beat. Get the Wedding soup and the meatball appetizer and then expect to take your entree home!"}
{"text":"Had dinner at Bucci's on Saturday night. It was pretty good.   We ordered some calamari to start. it was good but the marinara sauce that came with it wasn't my favorite. It was very thick and chunky - which isn't my thing - but the taste was fine.   Danielle's Chicken Parm looked really good and she offered me a taste but i declined. I'd slopped some sauce on my shirt (repeatedly) and I was in a foul mood.   I had the Chicken Marsala. The sauce was really good. Earlier reviews mentioned lots of mushrooms but i didn't feel there were a lot and I could have gone for more. The chicken was pretty good also. My dinner came with a cup of Italian Wedding Soup. It was really good but was not very hot.   Can't say whether I'll be back or not but I wouldn't be opposed."}
{"text":"Laid back atmosphere, minimal decor, attentive (usually) waitstaff, fresh food and, per my daughter, the best bread EVER.   Pizza is brick oven baked, so the crust is crisp and chewy. The sauce is light and tangy and they are generous with cheese and toppings.   My favorite items on the menu are the chicken marsala and the sausage stuffed peppers with cheese. The chicken marsala has tons of mushrooms and the best marsala sauce I've ever had. It's perfectly buttery and you can still taste the wine with hints of garlic and a beef broth base. The chicken is always tender too! The peppers are amazing too: tender sausage stuffing, hot banana peppers and cheese and sauce on top (you'll have to request the cheese-- it completes the dish!). Both items are just to die for.   Another favorite of my family is the wedding soup. It's got homemade meatballs, tiny pasta pearls and this amazing chicken broth that's super tasty all by itself.   The only complaint I have is the location. I wish they'd move into a nicer strip mall because this one is so run down. It's a nice restaurant and they'd do really well in a better strip! :)"}
{"text":"The food here is terrible. I went expecting a finer Italian dining experience. The parmigiana is $19. This is not low class. When I drink red wines, I like big, bold reds from Italy, Spain or South America. They had exactly five red wines on the menu, all terrible ones, for $5.50-6.50/glass. I had a rotten Ruffino Chianti. That was the Italian option. The only other possible option was a Shiraz. I got a dinner salad and crab cakes. The crab cakes are all filler/stuffing. I had trouble finding the crab. The sauce was so spicy it bit the back of your throat. The salad was lettuce out of a bag. The waitress told me the dressing options. I picked blue cheese. It was tasteless, and I was charged $1 extra for blue cheese dressing. What? The waitress didn't mention it. I would have gotten it anyway, but really? This was a declasse place that made me walk out thinking, \"Americans will eat anything.\""}
{"text":"I can't thank Bucci's enough.  It's a great place for a group to gather....they are ALWAYS accommodating.  The owner treats everyone special and obviously trains her staff to do likewise.  I originally booked a reservation for 12 but had to change it to 20 the day of, and no one batted an eye! Half our group were under 16 so we ordered three pizzas (MUST try the white), and almost  all the appetizers. wings- FAB, mozzarella fritta, hot peppers, chicken tenders  ALL GREAT. If you are looking for a family owned business with good Italian food, and GREAT service, look no further....."}
{"text":"We come to visit family for the thanksgiving holiday and have made a tradition out of eating at Bucci's Brick oven restaurant the night before the holiday. We are never disappointed. The staff couldn't be more accommodating and the food is spectacular. Traditional Italian favorites lasagna,ravioli, and eggplant parm are our families favorites. The ribeye steak really melts in your mouth and if soup is your favorite try the homemade soups. Creamy chicken and dumpling and Italian wedding soup are meals unto themselves. We highly recommend if you happen to be in the area to check it out."}
{"text":"I have to say Bucci's did come through and sent me the gift card which    was appreciated."}
{"text":"I come here all the time. One of my favs.  A little loud in here and the bathrooms are hideous dirty.  But the food and service is excellent."}
{"text":"The first time the experience was wonderful, so today we went out of our way to go back.  Disappointing to say the least!  Our waitress was the most uncaring, no personality person we have ever came across.  She didn't tell us the specials, she never cleared our dishes, she was oblivious to the fact that I did not get my correct meal.  As I sat there watching my husband and daughter eat, the manager asks \"What can she do to fix the problem\"  I ordered baked rigatoni, which came as penne with meat sauce.  She took my plate back, melted some cheese on half, just half of my entree and brought this back!!  (This was not a baked meal)  This was the manager.  Our waitress asked what she could do to fix this.  Maybe the pasta was cooked fine, but after taking it back to melt cheese on half it was overcooked and mushy, yuck!  The manager said she was making a new one, seriously, my family was done eating!  I asked the waitress to just mark my meal down to rigatoni with meat sauce, a 4 dollar down charge, and she couldn't do it,  the manager was sent back.  Seriously I was far too generous, I should have just asked her to take my meal off the bill., I didn't even eat 1/4!  The manager should go back to school and learn some customer service.  We also ordered too pizzas to go (their only redeeming quality)  I ate that instead.  We will not be back.  Apparently all Bucci's are not created equal."}
{"text":"Located in a strip mall in Middleburg Heights, this place may be a bit hard to find at first, but once you eat here you will surely not forget it.  I have eaten here on at least 4 occasions and have yet to be dissappointed.  The pizza is among the best in the Cleveland area and is accompanied by the taste from a real brick oven.  The food is also very good, and comes with bread and salad. The service was quick and prompt, and the server explained the different entrees.  I would reccomend this place to anybody who has not tried real brick oven pizza, or who simply wants great Italian food at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Nice space tucked back off the road but the gps took us right there. Started off with a strawberry salad which was excellent. The calamari was decent and it was a huge bowl full, definitely worthwhile. The garlic toast was a little bland, not much garlic flavor. Now the pizza. We got two, one with prosciutto (which was really standard lunch meat) and the other with kalamata olives and artichokes.  The sauce was a little tangy but the toppings were plenteous. Over all the food was decent. The bathroom was quite gross, either go before or wait til you get home."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza bar none in the Cleveland area. At first you see the area and you want to keep driving because it is in an old shopping strip that looks blah but the brick oven baked pizza, calamari and the wings are 'da bomb! I can't speak to the other items on menu but I'm telling you that you'll be hooked on the pizza for sure !"}
{"text":"Like everyone had said, I worry about the location and the sustainability long-term. That aside, the food here is always consistently good, which is really what counts. And, this isn't part of a corporate chain conglomerate trying to pass their food off as \"Italian.\" Support the small businesses owners.  My favorite is their eggplant parmigiana. Unlike some places that serve a few discs of eggplant covered with sauce and cheese, here you'll get a lasagna-style serving of layered eggplant nestled with layers of cheese and sauce. Delicious. I don't think of the calories, but it's worth it and honestly the best I've ever had at a restaurant. To up your protein, add a side of meatballs to compliment the meal. The calamari and Italian wedding soup are both also great choices. And, entrees come with a basket of warm slices bread and either garlic or plain butter. Olive oil available on request.    You'll leave stuffed and possibly with a doggy-bag for what you can't finish."}
{"text":"I tried Bucci's Brick Oven earlier this week. I called in a simple order, a large shredded mozzarella pizza. I was told it would be ready in 20 minutes & when I got there in 15 minutes, I was greeted with a warm large cheese pizza. So far, so good! I got home and couldn't wait to tear into it, as the anticipation was building all the way home as the smell of wood fired goodness permeated the car. I love love love their pizza sauce! There was the perfect amount of shredded mozzarella on each slice and the crust is so good! My only complaint is the bottom of the pizza had a thick layer of flour. Every first bite I took ended with a mouth full of flour. I ended up spitting most of them out (You know the first bite I'm talking about, right? The pointy end of each piece!! That's the best part.) But once you got past that, everything else was fantastic. I will definitely go back and try some of the other dishes, as their pasta menu looked pretty good! Plus, everyone's raving about their salads - will have to give them a try, too!!!"}
{"text":"Where does one head when they're in the mood for some wood-fired oven-baked pizza goodness? Actually, in the Cleveland area that's a damn good question. It seems that this traditional method of cooking is all but being phased out in the pizza world. Unless you're talking about Bucci's. Yup, they have actual brick ovens burning actual wood baking actual pizzas. OK, so that last one wasn't really necessary. Anyway, the wife and I were experiencing one of our all-too-regular pizza cravings and we wanted more than delivery.  Others have already belabored the whole strip mall location thing, so I won't bother. Our visit was sometime around 5pm (yeah, we eat with the gray hairs, so what) on a Friday. We walked in to a nearly empty restaurant. Pretty standard layout - hostess station up front, booths, tables, yadda yadda. It's pretty dimly lit, too. Ambiance maybe? The kitchen is at the back and you can entertain yourself (and annoy the employees) by staring at them through the glass while they make the food. It's sort of like a pizza maker aquarium.   Overall, our service was really good. We were greeted as soon as we walked in and the pace of the meal was on the fast side. Our server kept our iced teas filled and our table was cleared promptly of empty dishes. No complaints on this front at all.  The menu features pretty much what you'd expect from an Italian join like Bucci's. Meatballs calamari, salads, and the gamut of Picattas, Milaneses, Bolognaises, and Marsalas. Oh yeah, and plenty of real estate devoted to pizza. So let's start on the food, shall we?  We were there for the pizza so we ordered a small (plenty for two people, about 8 small slices) traditional red sauce variety with pepperoni, mushroom, banana peppers and green bell peppers. We ordered a house salad and calamari to keep our mouths busy while we waited for our pizza.  I honestly don't remember the house salad. Not that I'm saying it was bad or anything, just that it was a salad and I'm not all that turned on by leafy greens. I'm sure it was fresh, crispy, cold, and all that a salad should be. The tasty, well-seasoned calamari was fried a crispy, golden brown and the generous portion came with a few lemon wedges and a small bowl of warm marinara sauce for dipping.   When one goes out for wood-fired pizza, one has certain expectations, especially when it comes to the crust. It should be crispy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside and it simply must have that characteristic char that makes it taste so damn good. The crust at Bucci's doesn't disappoint. It ticks all of the right boxes. I thought it was on the thin side, though, flopping flaccidly as it was being served. So why only three stars. It was the toppings. For starters, canned mushroom. Seriously? Why would any pizza joint choose to use canned mushrooms. Fresh mushrooms just add so much to a pizza. Next, the green bell peppers appeared to have been placed on the pizza after it was cooked. They were barely warm and pretty much raw. I like the toppings on my pizzas, vegetables included, to be cooked. It's not all bad, though. It was tasty and the addition of the fresh chiffonade of basil is a nice touch."}
{"text":"Were not sure where to eat for Mother's Day and was in the area and by chance we found Bucci's.  Was here years ago & it was good. I ordered the pasta marsala with shrimp & crab and my god was it delicious!  Husband had pizza & really liked it.  Will be back again"}
{"text":"This IS truly the best pizza in Middleburgh Hts. and Cleveland.  We are regular guests of this restaurant when we want pizza. It is in a strip mall across from Southland shopping area and probably the best business in the strip.  Their pizza is hand tossed and this BUCCI's restaurant is the only Bucci's in the area with the brick oven. We stopped going to the Stronsgville Bucci'since it does not have the brick oven. The Middleburgh Hts. restaurant really provides the best baked crust, sauce, and margaritta toppings. The sauce is not sweetened like, Santos in Berea, or Angelo's in Olmsted Falls, Ohio which we cannot tolerate. Bucci's margaretta can even be ordered with fresh mozzarella and basil. Other specialty toppings like greek olives and prosciutto area also available. As a recommendation for the Margeritta Pizza, ask for fresh basil to be added. It really brings out the flavor.          Additionally, we cannot stop ourselves from also getting a Strawberry Salad that we share while waiting for the pizza, The salad comes in a beautiful large bowl that can be shared. It can easily serve 2-4 people. It is phenomenal in taste and texture and includes lettuce, mandarin oranges, glazed pecans cranberries, strawberries and goat cheese along with a poppy seed dressing that is best ordered on the side.  The staff is always friendly and serve very well. Take out is also available."}
{"text":"I don't hand out too many 5-star ratings, but I think Bucci's Brick Oven has the best pizza in the southern suburbs. The cheese they use is phenomenal, and makes the difference when coupled with the brick oven cooking.   I've eaten an entree there as well, but it wasn't memorable one way or the other; good or bad. As for pizza, however, Bucci's Brick Oven is a MUST."}
{"text":"This is the first time we were here. The food was super and had a verity off the menu. The cavettteli was well presented. The dinner strawberry salad was shared by all due to the wonderful taste. Two of us split the lasagne and it was tasteful. The wine only compliments the meal. Price was right!  Can back a year later to visit family and tried again. Serving staff remembered us and everything's was super.  We tried shrimp and angel hair pasta.    Wonderful.  Wine was great!"}
{"text":"Me and my wife tried this place it was 40 minutes before closing and I don't know if they got angry at us for showing up late but we got the worst case of food poisoning after eating there however the food was good some of the best I would say in Cleveland but after our food came to the table the chef gave us a funny look and we got severe food poisoning that night I'll never go here again unfortunately"}
{"text":"I have seen this restaurant for years and I guess I judged a book by its cover, bc I have never been here due to not being impressed with the location and the outside.   I was wrong   It was a good dinner! I ordered the chicken parm, bc of something I read about it and it was delicious. My husband couldn't decide between pizza and the chic parm so he was excited to see that they had a chicken parm pizza. He was happy! It was all good  We will return"}
{"text":"I just used Bucci's for a large catering order and it was fantastic.  They went above and beyond to make it a nice event - special thanks to Jennifer Gentile for being so easy to work with, and so helpful when choosing the food.  She was great!!  Her food suggestions worked out very well.  The food is always great at the restaurant, but it's a different animal to make and deliver 8 different dishes to an outdoor party, and they did it flawlessly."}
{"text":"We ordered a pizza from here and we thought it was going to be good because of their brick oven. I picked the pizza up and got it home and I immediately smelled fishy odor coming from the mushrooms. The mushrooms were old. On top of that the dough was raw. So I took the pizza back and they gave me a refund. That's it! They didn't do anything special for me for my inconvenience! Bad food, bad customer service! We'll never order from there again. Not even worth the 1 star!"}
{"text":"Fantastic, authentic Italian pizza, great service.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"I have been here many times but the last couple were not good. Tonight when we came in we were told there was a 15 minute wait  and I counted 8 empty tables. What was the wait for? Seems that since they got the new hostess the service has gone down hill. They also stopped serving lunch. I love the food but the service makes me not want to return."}
{"text":"Last night I found an authentic Italian restaurant on the west side! Finally! The food was delicious and the waitress was friendly and attentive. This place is a hidden gem.   I had read some reviews that claimed the sauce was flavorless and/or tart. Ok people, this isn't Prego or Ragu brand sauce. This is how real Italian sauce should taste. If you want a cup of sugar with your pasta, stick with your Buca di Beppo or Olive Garden. The sauce is anything but flavorless... But, if you think the above pseudo-Italian options are how true Italian sauce should taste, I can understand the disconnect.    The short: Come here if you always say to your friends when they suggest Italian, \"No restaurant even comes close to my mom's pasta sauce.\""}
{"text":"The food was good, but I gave this place a poor rating because I went last night (on a thursday) for dinner with two friends. We started dinner at 7 pm. By 9 pm, they had turned off all of the lights but those on our table and were staring at us trying to get us to leave. I tried to use the restroom but the lights were off in the hall and restroom. I had to ask them to turn them back on. I proceeded to use the facilities only to find that they had also shut off the water (in their rapid close down routine) leaving me unable to flush and wash my hands (which I discovered only after I'd thoroughly coated my hands with soap).   They were unapologetic when I told them what happened and made no attempt to rush to help me clean my soap coated hands. Again, food would have gotten a 3.5 maybe 4 but this left a lasting impression with me and my friends who frequently dine in the area for our salsa classes. Never again."}
{"text":"From the moment my husband and I walked in we were ready to go. Weird atmosphere. Unfriendly Waitress made us feel like we were not wanted. She also had no knowledge of the wine selection or menu didn't seem like she wanted to talk at all. It was almost like we were bothering her. I did notice a large group was getting catered to. I looked at my husband and said lets get out of here. We ended up at Antonio's at Parmatown and had a fabulous evening."}
{"text":"On a quest for good pizza, Bucci's is about as good as it gets in Cleveland.  The Brick oven makes all the difference and replicates old world Italian pizza.  I have enjoyed many of their pasta dishes and it is refreshing to see an Italian restaurant that doesn't over cook their pasta and actually uses decent quality pasta.  Service has always been friendly and attentive.  Portions are large enough to satisfy our great Midwestern appetites. The only reason I didn't give it a five star was that many of the dishes are more \"American Italian\" dishes than true Italian recipes that you would find in Italy.  So it you want greasy and heavy pizza, soggy and poor quality noodles and cheap parmesan cheese, this isn't the place for you."}
{"text":"Tried to order dinner tonight from these guys and they said they're kitchen is closed early.... no explanation, no apology, just kept telling me they're closing early.   Unacceptable in my opinion"}
{"text":"Their pizza definitely gets 4 or 5 stars from me.  However the rest of my experience here scaled back my general rating to 3. My friend and I arrived here, and walked in and saw the generally unimpressive interior of this place - kinda looked like it was decorated a decade or two ago and hasn't been updated since.  We saw no sign indicating whether we should seat ourselves or not, so we waited.  And waited.  And then sat in a bench, and waited some more.  About 10-15 minutes later we actually had to grab a waitress as she was taking someone else's order, and asked if we are supposed to seat ourselves.  She apologized for not seeing us and sat us down.  This fashion of slow if not complete lack of service continued for the rest of the night.  But as I said, the pizza was delicious.  Ingredients tasted fresh, and the menu had a nice Italian selection beyond just the pizzas that they are so known for - all for reasonable prices. It's just not quite as enjoyable when you're annoyed by the service."}
{"text":"excellent we went there during the week we had drinks and pizza and then dinner was a great experience and will definitely come back. I work around the corner but we live in Willoughby and have to say this place is worth the drive! fresh ingredients and a very friendly staff. must try it to see for yourself!"}
{"text":"Good pizza. Service needs some work though. It took 15 minutes for us to receive a bottle of Bud Light when everyone else had their drinks."}
{"text":"Came in Saturday evening at 7:45, SEVERAL empty tables, get 15 min wait!   Got a table, waited another 7 minutes for a person to ask if we wanted drinks! It was the hostess!   Ordered with her, food came out rather quickly, food was good! Pizzas need to be left in longer! Too floppy! Great taste though! When our food was on the table our server showed up! WHAT?!   For a Saturday night, organization should be on point with service!   Would have been a 5 star if service was at should have been! Hopefully the hostess gets a cut of the tip! She did it all!"}
{"text":"The best food in the greater Cleveland area.  As soon as I get to  town I head right to Bucci's Brick Oven.  The Chicken Marsala is the best!  Never had a bad meal at this place.  Love it!"}
{"text":"Besides the sketch of the strip mall, the food is the tastiest around. I ordered two pizzas, a caeser salad, and wings and they were honestly top notch. I would feel confident bringing their food home to serve a party. The price couldn't be beat either! Their obviously passing down the savings from the low rent strip mall to the customers which I commend them for. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This strip mall gem is the perfect place the go for a quick bite! We started with a small  brick oven white pizza with portobello mushrooms and it was the perfect start to our meal because it was light and crispy. I had the buffalo chicken salad (I'm salvaging thinking about it) while the other half had the meatball sub. We both had no complaints!  Then we ordered takeout here a few days ago and I was a little less satisfied than the first visit. Portions seemed smaller and the biggest turn off was that they didn't clean the seeds out of our stuffed peppers and all three of us were choking....they were so spicy because of the seeds. Everything else was still good!   My favorite thing from here are the wings, they are a must have!   I am sure there are better places to grab a bite but I would much rather come here than a dime a dozen chain restaurant."}
{"text":"I sold my brother on getting out of the house for lunch today. He seemed all hell bent on Denny's of all places, but I suggested a local place, preferably of the Italian variety.  I ordered a large pizza, half with sauce, cheese, & basil, and the other half including tasty sausage - $10.00.  Toss in an excellent Caesar salad, and two cold beers for me and I was fat & happy - figuratively speaking.  My brother was craving pork chops, so he ordered the dinner entree of Pork Chops Milanese. I sampled a bite and can confirm it was moist, generously-sized, & tasty - $19.00.  A house salad and a soft drink satisfied his cravings nicely.  All in all, we exited full & happy for the sum of $42.00 plus tip.     Photos:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fLpzBjIoQrCYaA7svKiJ9Q?select=P4SPmTnjwCpikJILJ8W0PQ"}
{"text":"What a find!  Besides being located in the weirdest of strip malls, Buccis is amazing in every way. Casual enough to not be pretentious yet upscale enough to make you feel like you're dining somewhere special. The menu was on spot for Italian favorites. Start with very fresh and soft bread with a little olive oil/parm dipper, nice! House salad was solid and all veggies crisp and fresh too! No short cuts here. For main course I had cavatelli, a first for me. Amazing!  My other half had traditional spaghetti and meatballs. Meatballs were huge and full of Italian flavors. The sauce was probably the best I've ever had.  The service: Katie was incredible!  Helpful! Friendly! Knowledgeable! Unobtrusive yet always right there if we needed something. She knew what we wanted before we did!  Katie, are you clairvoyant?   I am so glad we discovered this local spot and that I don't have to drive up to the shore for a fantastic classy meal. Buccis, don't change a thing. I'll be back very soon to try one of those brick oven pizzas. Until then, keep the fire burning. This is definitely a hot spot in the SW corner of the county!"}
{"text":"I don't know why I was so crabby back in 2012. Stopped in tonight and had the awesome strawberry salad and spaghetti with blush sauce and both blew me away...again."}
{"text":"Disappointed in my Bucci's experience today. The bathrooms are beyond disgusting. I contemplated not even using them.  Our service was mediocre, she barely deserved the 20% tip. Also we were charged for bread. What???!!! It's really good bread and we'd be fine to pay for it, but they should tell you that either in the menu or when you ask for another basket.  My food was also just okay. Caesar salad was slightly wilted and dressing oily. Bianco pizza had a very good flavor but crust was a little flimsy, soggy and thin.   I've had some wonderful meals here and am generally a fan of all the Bucci's restaurants  I wouldn't rule it out, just hoping for a better experience next time."}
{"text":"The sauce is good with plenty of basil, oregano and fresh tomato. The crust was decent, very similar to that of Geraci's. A little on the soft side, not as crispy as I prefer my crust to be. Maybe it is because of the Lake Erie water used to make it, not NYC water. Who knows if that is true. Anyways the cheese is alright, but I have had better. Overall, this is one of the best places within a few hours drive that has an alright brick oven pizza. Better than Vincenzas."}
{"text":"I've been to Buccis many times and have taken many people with me, I've never heard anything but praise for their food after dinner by those I've taken and of course mine is always perfect, or I wouldn't keep going back. The grilled STEAK SALAD is hands down the most amazing salad I've ever had! The staff is always on point and gracious and the prices are fair and portions are good! Oh...be sure to ASK for the garlic butter with your bread...yummmy Top Notch, I need to go back soon...it's been a minute...Cmon Cmon, lets go to BUCCIS"}
