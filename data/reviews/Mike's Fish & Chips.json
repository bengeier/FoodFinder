{"text":"Great fish, the rest of the menu is worth passing on. The owners are super friendly and what's really cool is you get to see tine cut of fresh fish, and see them make it right in front of your eyes. Unless you live in the area I couldn't not see you walking through their doors."}
{"text":"Fish was very small, about 4\" long. Total was $13 with tax, too much for such a tiny piece of fish. Too bad because it tasted good and they seem nice, but it was kind of a rip off."}
{"text":"I have walked by this place several times but never happened to be in the mood for fish and chips. I Finally popped in with the family. We ordered to go; cod with chips and a coleslaw, shrimp, the scallops with chips and gravy. I have to say that we were all very happy. The cod had a nice thin crispy batter and had a wonderful soft flakey texture that was moist. The shrimp was perfectly breaded and had a nice fresh flavour. I didn't try the scallops but my wife said they were meaty and very enjoyable. The chips were thick cut with some skin on which I like. I will be going back."}
{"text":"I've been living in the area for a year now, and I've always walked by and wanted to try it out. I finally went, and was very disappointed.   The atmosphere was warm and welcoming. The owners (I'm assuming), were very nice people and deserve two thumbs up for their service.   Now for the food. I ordered the 'haddock fish and chips combo' for $10. First off, the batter on the fish was not flavourful. It wasn't seasoned nor tasted good. Every bite was pure oil from the deep fryer. Alongside with this complaint, the fries were the same way. No salt or seasoning was added to them. I myself did add salt and a little bit of pepper to it after, to give it some taste, but that didn't even work. The fries were either old, frozen (which isn't a big deal, but you have to do it right), or no love was going into them. And finally, the haddock. The single piece of haddock I got was really thin and I felt like I got ripped off. It was 30% fish and 70% batter. Every bite was little fish and a lot of batter. But the haddock was cooked perfectly, so their's a thumbs up.    Overall, I wouldn't come back here due to the lack of seasoning and bland food. I would rather take a subway to Jack Astor's or some pub to get fish and chips. The distance would be well worth it."}
{"text":"I think Mike's has the best fish and chips in the city..and at the best price..the place is small.. I mean small and nothing to look at but maybe that is the charm? I have to say Mike and his wife are the nicest people ever who make you feel like family.. plus you know they offer a good business when you are sitting there and a steady stream of people are coming in and out for take away. I have gone to them all in the pursuit of great fish and chips and I will travel to Mikes.. I love their stuff.. I like this place the best.. I will be honest I do take away so I am not there for the ambiance"}
{"text":"I've been eating at Mike's for over 15 years; this place is a neighbourhood institution! Mike and Maria are the sweetest, kindest, most wonderful folks who truly take pride in what they serve. Whether you order fish and chips, or a souvlaki dinner, the food is always on point. Also, I'm not sure what hey put in their gravy put I'm 99% sure it's crack - it's just that good.   I can't stress how important it is to support local businesses like this! Mike and Maria are shining examples of what makes our community and neighbourhood such a great place to live."}
{"text":"Mike's is a tiny fish & chips joint on the desolate stretch of Danforth near Woodbine. The owner, Mike I assume, is a friendly guy and his small restaurant does take-away and has half a dozen seats.  I was lured in by a sign for $3.25 poutine. It turned out to be not so great. The frozen fries were nothing special but they were at least cooked up nice and crispy. The gravy was really salty and didn't have much else in the way of flavour. The cheese was grated mozzarella. Not exactly the most traditional or tasty poutine but it was at least large and cheap.  My friend got a piece of deep fried cod for $4.70. He seemed to think it was okay but not great.  Considering how few good food options there are on this stretch of the Danforth, Mike's is probably about as good as your going to get in the area."}
{"text":"Going go give them a very generous 3 for the fish and chips.  Fish was of decent quality, the batter was a little overdone, and the fries were not the best, but if you're craving fish and chips in this area, it will get the job done."}
