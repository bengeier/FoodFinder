{"text":"Wow, where to begin?  We just moved to Anthem from Dallas Texas and were looking for a great pizza/Italian place to eat at, but this is NOT the place.  We entered and there were only two other  dinners in the place, one was a family of 5 and the other was a family of 3, we were a party of 2.  We were seated and told that are waitress would be with us in just a minute.  Well, that minute turned out to be about 10 minutes.  Having had time to read the menu about a dozen times while we waited, when our waitress finally did show up we were ready to order but she ask us if we wanted to put in a drink order?  Really???  So we did put in an order for 2 glasses of wine and asked for water as well.  About 10 minutes later we received our wine (very small pour indeed) and no water?  As we were waiting for our food order (I'll get to that train wreck in just a minute) we noticed that the other two occupied tables were having issues with their orders and all we could hear was the waitress consistently apologizing, we also watch as the other tables food was delivered, ONE freaken plate at a time, first one child got some breadsticks, then about 4 minutes later the other child got a salad, then about 10 minutes later the father got his order, then they apparently asked for water and it was delivered ONE glass at a time by the same server (not waiter???) then we experienced the same absolutely mind numbing food delivery, with the exception that I had ordered the 10\" pizza (which was pretty good after a 20 minuet wait) but my wife had ordered a chicken pasta dish, which we never received.  The waitress brought the pizza and two plates and started to walk away and I ask where my wife's meal was and she looked stunned, walked away and came back and told us that she had turned in the order but the \"kitchen\" must have misread it, but she would re-enter the order, well that was about 2 glasses of wine each and one very small pizza later, which had already taken about 55 minutes....duh!  So we simply told her to cancel the order and we would just pay for the pizza and wine and be happy to leave.  It was one of the worst dinning experiences we have ever had.  The \"manager\" was there, tending a small bar, at which NO ONE was sitting, but he did manage to go and clean the back door glass while all of his customers were waiting for service.  It was a totally dysfunctional, totally unacceptable experience and I doubt that we will ever return, unless my wife bets me that it couldn't possible be that bad on a second visit and I might be willing to accept that \"sure bet\"!!!  Unfortunately in Anthem the dinning options are very limited and even the Legend Sports Bar (well, sort of a sports bar) is failing as it changes management???  I ordered a pizza there last  week and was told after a 15 minute wait that they had no cheese for the pizza because the whole kitchen/management team just weren't ordering any food?  Wow, what a way to make a transition in business ownership!!! Someone please help these clueless owners/managers!!"}
{"text":"Recently had pizza and wings plus two drinks. The food was decent but once the bill arrived the thrill was gone. With a good tip our bill hit $60. A bit ridiculous for pizza n wings"}
{"text":"We dined here after receiving a coupon mailer. Having eaten pizza from the time I was a kid back east, good pizza, then suffering once in a while from that cardboard crap from the major take out joints which advertise on TV, I was pleasantly surprised and then thrilled with our experience here. The store is located in a neat strip mall on Fort Apache near Russell Road. The inside was spotless and it was clear that someone takes a great deal of pride in the appearance. Our server came promptly, answered questions, and took our order. She brought some rolls and marinara sauce as we waited, which was great. Our pizza arrived and it not only looked great but tasted great as well, hot and delicious. We took two slices home and even after resting for a day, the taste and texture of the crust and toppings was superb. We opted for the New York Combo and it's one of the best pizzas I've ever eaten and we will certainly return. Thanks very much for proving that a traditional pizza restaurant can still exist and more than successfully compete with the best."}
{"text":"I gave 2 stars because the artichoke spinach dip was pretty darn good. Aside from that the service was lousy, the pizza was soggy and the wine? I've had better wine out of a box lol. Sorry guys but for the prices you charge you should really step your game up just a little bit. = /"}
{"text":"Great Sub's and Friendly Atmosphere

Stopped in to Streets of New York on Union Hills in Sun City for carry out (first time visit) and was immediately greeted and made to feel like a regular by John Collins.  John explained the menu and daily sub special and I ordered 3 Little Italy Beef sub's...John provided the estimated waiting time for my take out and when I said I would wait he offered up a seat at the bar and suggested a good local beer.  As I waited, John checked on me and actually brought out a couple of tasty breadsticks and dipping sauce on-the-house.  Great service that made it feel like a local hang out instead of a chain.  Everyone back home loved the sub's...sure wish I could have stayed for another beer to enjoy the friendly atmosphere there."}
{"text":"Very good french fries and my sub was pretty delicious."}
{"text":"If there was ever a way to describe how food tastes and/or where the chef gets their food Streets of New York is not shy about it. After all they did name the restaurant Streets of New York which is what their food tastes like because I'm sure that's where they scraped it from. If they read this review maybe they'll change the restaurant name to Streaks of My Pants.

I'd give less stars is possible. We've ordered from Streets a few times and each time the delivery was a little longer than expected. Each time we ordered we just thought \"maybe they're really busy or they're having an off night.\" No.. they just suck. The first time we called in an order they told us to call a different Streets because they don't send drivers to our neighborhood. I explained that we were actually closer to their location than the one they recommended and the girl hung up. Found out that we can order online and just figured how can they f*ck that up? Well don't know how, but they did. Pizza was under cooked. Things were on the pizza that we specifically marked to not be on the pizza.
 - On a side note, I've seen their delivery drivers in our neighborhood while out walking the dog and they drive like goddamn maniacs. Small neighborhood with short winding streets and sidewalks with cars parked tightly on them and children running about and here comes the Streets delivery driver at 60 mph careening around a corner almost killing a child and still doesn't hit the breaks. So if you decide to order some Streets after reading this, tell the driver to slow down a bit. Killing someone's dog isn't worth your sh*tty food.

Ok so my wife and I agreed to never deal with Streets ever again. Her sister calls and says hey you wanna meet at Streets for dinner. I'm not paying so we agree to go. First bad sign, the parking lot is completely vacant apart from her sister's car. Second bad sign, we walk in and the whole place smells like a sewer line burst. The smell was so bad my wife almost vomited on our way to the table. The waitress brought us our drinks and took our orders. Three sandwiches and a salad took all of 35 minutes to cook. I choked down my sandwich and immediately felt sick. Similar to having broken bottles in my gut. My wife's sister paid with her credit card. The waitress took the card and was gone for about 15 minutes. Mind you there are only three other tables in the whole place. I eventually left the table to evacuate my bowls. Funny thing about the bathroom is that the door to the toilet stall doesn't really close and the toilet isn't bolted down. We sped home where my wife promptly locked herself away in a bathroom and I in another. It's 10:00 pm. This all happened at 6 pm. I'm still wishing I were dead and I may miss work tomorrow. I still have the smell of the sewer flavored restaurant in my nose.

Papa Johns' and Dominos' have never messed up an order for me, are always fast, friendly, fairly priced and have never made me sick."}
{"text":"I noticed the prices on the menu on this application is not posted accurately.  Large X-cheese pizza was $20, unless extra cheese cost $5?  It would be nice to have accurate prices before you call."}
{"text":"Excellent breasted chicken, delicious!  Bread sticks are unparalleled, a meal onto themself.  Prices fair, atmosphere family friendly."}
{"text":"This place is great, the food and the atmosphere are awesome. The biggest downfall are the prices...this place is waaaaaaaay overpriced. If it were a few bucks a pie cheaper I would go there more often, but paying $60 for and antipasto and two 16\" pizzas is just insane."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery and it was a mistake. My soup came in a sandwich like to go container, luckily I had something I could transfer it into to eat. The sandwich i ordered was supposed to come with bacon instead I got ham. The pesto was non existent, instead all I tasted was mayo. The raviolis were cold and looked like they had been sitting out for awhile and the sauce was undesirable."}
{"text":"The pizza was ok, a bit too much cheese. The combo appetizer was horrible. The onion rings were over fried, the mozzarella sticks were soggy from sitting and the fried zucchini wasn't even cooked. The beer batter was raw!!!! Probably won't go back here as this isn't the first time our order has been less than stellar"}
{"text":"Do NOT eat here! The food is okay, but the customer service and delivery are HORRIBLE! I ordered at 7:00 P.M. and got my dinner at 8:49 P.M. and then was lied to that they \"tried\" to call me. There was no apology, no service, just excuses! On a Tuesday? seriously! The food went in the trash, as I had already eaten at that point! BUYER BEWARE! These people need customer service training! I hope they read \"Knock your socks off service!\""}
{"text":"Ordered wings for delivery and they were terrible. No meat on the wings, and way over cooked.  I love streets of New York pizza but VERY disappointed in their wings"}
{"text":"This is one of my families favorite places to go! The chicken parm is amazing and my kids LOVE the broaster chicken. It has a wonderful family atmosphere and the service is great. Make sure you save room for desert because you don't want to miss out on the passion cookie!!!! AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"Every time we went in there weren't many people; which was fine for us. You seat yourself and your server will usually come quickly. Nice and clean from what we could see. Friendly staff. Some of the bread was a little hard, but it wasn't the end of the world. We still ate it. We liked the environment so we will likely be back."}
{"text":"Average food and inattentive servers. I would not return without a groupon. It's not worth paying full price for bad service"}
{"text":"Very unsatisfied. After several comments and notes given- they failed to deliver my roommates and my food at the same time. Both orders of food were room temperature and therefore soggy. No napkins or utensils were given to us. Waste of $40- completely."}
{"text":"My husband  and i have been to this restaurant several times along with our family , will NEVER GO BACK the food is very good the service is the worst !!!!!!  The last 3 times it has gotten worst , the first time we let it go the second time I called talked with the owner and told her how bad the service  was , my husband and I went there for dinner it was 8:30 pm we did not know they closed at 9 pm so the server was RUDE when she took our order I asked for some of the garlic bread and she said we may have some but they are old and we have had them all day ... REALLY like we want garlic bread that everyone has touched. When the food comes out, i ordered chicken parm, what a joke it was a bunch of old spaghetti with a piece of chicken on top it looked so bad that i did not even eat it. Although my husband's pizza was good . While we were eating they started cleaning the floors around us putting chairs up on table's while we were eating,  right next to us .The sever never checked on us gave us our check while we were still eating , we asked if we could have coffee and dersert she had attuide was SO RUDE!! So I called and talked to the owner the next day and told her what had happened and she was so nice and gave us credit and wanted us to come back so we did , should have never went back food was good the service was good Sterling was our server. With that said, it was my step daughters birthday and we had told him ,  wanted him to bring a cake with a candle which he never did .Had to ask in front of her for a dessert brought but  NO CANDLE charge us for the dersert which that's fine but no candle and did not ofter coffee , think he forgot took so long went and found him and said can we have check we were going to the movies . NEVER AGAIN. Oh and he had the check in his hand when I said for a third time it is her birthday can we get desert ? He was very nice and a great server but with that incident it was disappointing.  Really ??? Terrible......"}
{"text":"The service was fast. The little bread appetizers was a plus. I liked their ranch and marinara sauce. I did not like the soup. The pizza was good. The people there are friendly."}
{"text":"Thank you, Debbin and owner Mr Robert, the food was great and Excellent service all the way around, #TheGooieLouie"}
{"text":"Disclosure: I have never eaten in the restaurant, I have always ordered for pickup since it's no more than 400 feet from my house.

Streets of NY is among my favorite places for take-out pizza - it's delicious! I love the pizza - it's definitely more of a NY pie (a little greasy, thin, floppy) - but it's SOOO good. I've had both the supreme and pepperoni. I recently ordered the artichoke dip, which I'd skip in the future (a lot of calories for not a lot of taste)... I'll just be sure to make up the calories in an extra slice.  MMmm."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever but again everything in the menu is amazing. Robin the owner is great she makes you feel like you are part of the family. This is the only place I buy my pizza from and obviously because it can't compare to anything else."}
{"text":"Last straw.  Sat done ordered and waited.  No one came back, watched lots of other people get their stuff and we waited.  Maybe if the owner didn't cater to his friends who happened to be a party of 20 plus maybe we would have been attended to. I don't know but I will say it. Yes we were the only ones of color.  Yes I said it. But I don't like to think that. I forgave the waitress that walks blindly around me and asks the other numerous tables can I help you. I wish this disgusting place would close or get a new owner. Yes he was there catering to his friends.  It must have been him since he was running around for them. I'm ok now. I will tell everyone I know."}
{"text":"Our experience tonight wasn't the best. We ordered a Sausage and Peppa's but our pizza was delivered Peppa's and Onions. Cooks mistake they forgot to put the sausage on the pie.  When we brought it our servers attention I was kind of shocked when she said \"when i was bringing the pizza out I noticed it was missing sausage\".  Really and you still served it??.. I too have been a mediocre server, however I can say if I felt something was not prepared correctly I was having the cooks correct it stat. As quick as our pizza came out the server and cooks could have corrected it and another 5mins would not have been missed. 
Overall the now veggie pizza was good. I might try this location again."}
{"text":"Service at this place is horrible! Decided to try the pizza here, and called about 4:15pm on a Thursday to place an order for delivery. It took forever for someone to answer the phone, and when they did, I was placed on hold 3-4 times and waited nearly 5 minutes for someone to take what I considered a simple order, a large cheese pizza. The girl told me it would be 45 min to 1 hr. Over an hour had gone by and our pizza still had not been delivered, so I called to see what was going on. Initially they couldn't even figure out what my order was because hey didn't take my name when I initially placed the order. I again was placed on hold at least 3 times and a guy finally told me it would be there soon. After complaining that it had been well over an hour, I expected at least an apology and maybe a discount in a future order...something. But was left even more disappointed. He pizza was finally delivered at 5:45, it took an hour and a half to get 1 pizza. To top it all off, the pizza taste was mediocre. Definitely will never go to, or order from this place again."}
{"text":"I really like the pizza here, but the prices are just ridiculous. I thought they were a bit pricey before but today I went to order pizza to be delivered at home and it was $63 for 2 small pizza's and 2 orders of wings. They told me on the phone that they recently increased their prices. Their food is good, but not that good. I cancelled my order."}
{"text":"Came with a party of 5. Very cozy seating area. The server was super attentive and helpful, and they stock Angry Orchard which we love. The fries weren't done all the way. I could swear they are either Walmart Great Value brand frozen fries or taste just like them. We got a specialty pizza, and I'd call it a step above Papa Johns. I kind of think that for $25 a pizza should be amazing, and it was just good... but overall it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Great food here and a good neighborhood place out of the craziness of the Norterra roundabout area!!"}
{"text":"Don't order online, doesn't work, company lied about placing my order. Received emails confirming  order. After hour & half, texted to see where my order was & was told it's about to leave rest. Called rest. & they told me they never received it from online company. Took 2 hours to get pizza. Call your order in."}
{"text":"Love to visit this place....they never disappoint me from the nicest people staffed like Samantha to the fabulous people who do the cooking! They always seem to hook me up nicely! Good times, good food & good place! :)"}
{"text":"Hot pastrami sandwich rocked. Beers aren't horribly expensive, serves most domestic brand. 
Good prices, good service, will come back again."}
{"text":"I LOVE streets! I've been coming to this location ever since I was a wee boy. I've never left hungry nor dissatisfied. The staff is great, the food is great, and they always have a good game on one of their TVs. 

I pretty much always get the Italian stallion. For two reasons: it's delicious and I get to yell Adrian with a mouth full of ice whenever the server brings it. I'm not sure if it a pity laugh or they are fans of Rocky. Either way, someone always laughs. 

They also serve passion cookies (pazookies) which are half baked cookies with a scoop of ice cream to boot. It's a ballin' peice of culinary work. You need to get one when you go. 

Seriously, give it a try and you'll be a huge fan in no time."}
{"text":"They should be sued for defaming New York!! 

If these people are from New York tor Italian, they should go out back and shoot themselves!! If not, then any good New Yorker or Italian should do it for them!

I ordered the Baked Ziti, My Sister in Law ordered Penne, and My Wife Ordered Macaroni and Cheese, First, we all were given Mosticcolli for every order. I would consider this false advertising as it is not what is stated in their menu. The Sauce was the same for the Penne and Ziti Dish, Bland, No flavor, just mushed tomatoes.

After looking at the menus, who the hell puts ham in a lasagne?? food doesn't just suck, it swallows!!"}
{"text":"They have a great location, great food but the worst service every time. Will continue to go to the Ft. Apache location."}
{"text":"This place has awesome food and great customer service! Dine in or delivery we have never been disappointed. The servers and managers are always friendly and my family always looks forward to the delicious food."}
{"text":"My boyfriend brought meatball subs home from Rays last night. So darn good. Meatballs and sauce had such great flavor. Toasted roll. And huge. Could have split one but was sure glad we didn't when I had the left overs for lunch. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I wish their was a no star. My wife and I typically carry out from Oregano's down the street(5 stars), but we gave this delivery a shot. Complete disappointment and rip off!! We should have stuck to our typical routine. We ordered a medium pizza and wings and the price was ridiculous for the quality and the portions. We paid the same amount for the delivery that we would at Oreganos and that includes beers. The cheese was rubbery and to be honest it taste the same as any other pizza place throughout the valley. Do yourself a favor and consider something else. I'm assuming that it's called Streets of NY because it's prices are up to par with NYC's cost of living. Complete let down. They must still owe Gonzo for the awful radio commercial I heard the other day. I apologize for the rant, but if it's one thing I can't stand it's flushing money down the toilet. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Took the family to dinner tonight thought we would give this business a try based on a mailing we had received. My son and girlfriend both ordered 12 piece boneless wings they were over cooked and crunchy with a burnt taste smothered in sauce. I ordered a calzone it had no flavor very bland and very runny. The only thing we did enjoy was the appetizer of meatballs, our server was very polite (Kristin) but for $60.00 would definitely take them somewhere else in the future."}
{"text":"I realize that it is a pizza place. But it's not the pizza I,m crazy about. They have a little known throw back called Broaster Chicken. It's sooo much crispier than regular fried chicken.Weather you pick up or stay for a cold beer, and the delivery service is fast and efficient, it's always hot and juicy"}
{"text":"Ever since finding this restaurant, I've had everything from pizza to chicken to calzones. They are all good! If you're eating in, the dining room is really nice. Delivery is good but can sometimes take a minute due to the high demand. Always have gotten my food hot though. Easy to get into and out of right off fort Apache."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at this restaurant at least 2 to 4 timea a month. Haven't been back there in three months. We always enjoyed the food especially the New York combo pizza, pear salad, chicken parmigiana & hot pastrami sub. But when we were left standing waiting for a table with our daughter and grandchildren because a waitress moved THREE people from a table for FOUR who were already seated  to a booth that would have fit the FIVE of us that was ridiculous. Therefore we had to wait for 15  minutes or more for them to clean another booth which they were in no hurry to get to. I guess our patronage over the year or more we dined there was not appreciated at all !!! There are many other restaurants in town that appreciate your business, obviously the
y don't give a damn."}
{"text":"Only reason I am giving 2 stars is because the servers were so nice. We live right down the street and have tried this place twice now, first for happy hour and then again for dinner. Happy hour food was just gross and the pizza was not much better. It was more like pizza bread. The salad which was actually pretty good, was ruined with canned pears. It's a pear salad and they give you canned pears?! New York eateries would be embarrassed."}
{"text":"Service is a little slow. Food is pretty good."}
{"text":"Pizza is great - steaming hot when it was brought to the table.  Manager goes above & beyond to ensure great customer service."}
{"text":"I live in Scottsdale, I was visiting a friend who lives by the stadium and she always talks about how good the pizza is here (she's from new York city)we Came here on a Saturday night, not very busy. A very small comfortable atmosphere though. service was great! Our server was really friendly and polite. The bruschetta was delicious and the pizza came out nice and hot. I topped this off with a nice glass of cold wine and it was a great dinner overall. Definitely will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"I've read some of the reviews and was really surprised.  We are here from Oregon and came here one night close to closing and the staff was polite, didn't rush us and the pizza was the best we can remember ever having.  The restaurant was very clean - the sticky feel of the tables is because they need to be revarnished.  If this is what you call bad food, dirty and bad service you must have been having a hard day.   Love this and wish it were closer. It's the best."}
{"text":"Three stars for the food and an extra for the excellent service.  We ordered chicken parm with spaghetti, kids spaghetti, and baked ziti. The chicken parm was not parmigiana-just one plain piece of naked white mediocre chicken with marinara sauce over it. The sauce was excellent though. The spaghetti was broken in half before served-you can't even roll it up properly, so annoying but it tasted good. The baked ziti was ok, too much ricotta mixed into the sauce. Our server was great, I wish I caught his name. I'll think twice before going there again-sorry to say."}
{"text":"Terrible service! We tried to order a pizza from this location, was on hold for 10 minutes. Called back again to only be put on hold. Lost our business. We will never be ordering from there again. We get better service at dominos pizza than this"}
{"text":"I love Streets of New York! It is a great spot for lunch, great service and food.  The salads are excellent."}
{"text":"Food was Good. Service was horrible.  When we asked to speak with the manager to confirm something he proceeded to shout from where he was. Didn't even bother to come to the table. Incredibly rude.  

Will not be a returning customer."}
{"text":"Poor Customer Service!!!!
I found a piece of plastic wrap in my pizza crust. I called to speak to a manager and was told they would put me on hold until one became available.  I hung up at minute number 3. I called back and got a young man on the phone. He said he was the manager. Twice! He offered a replacement pizza or a credit for a new one later. I told him I wanted a refund. He put me on hold to ask the actual manager. 
This was my last bad experience with them. Management doesn't seem to care."}
{"text":"I placed an online order worth almost $100. The order was supposed to take an hour and my order arrived 15 late. I asked the driver if there was crushed red peppers or packets of parmesan cheese included and the driver said she was actually a waiter since they were too busy. Isn't it common practice to just provide those things regardless of who's delivering!?  Anywho, my order was incorrect and an item was missing. I called and let them know about the mistake. I spoke to a female manager and she, at first, said she would deliver the item missing and fix my order and provide 20% of for next delivery. I was ok with this. About 10 minutes later the manager calls back and says that they have never in their history of business existence have they had an online error. I told the Manager that I paid a hefty amount for my food and just wanted it to be fixed. She said it was my error and they have never made an online mistake. This is just craziness that a buisness has never made an error before!!!! This totally ruined my football and UFC night with friends. I will never order from this pizza place AGAIN. Horrible customer service, calling their customers liars!!! Please take a screen shot of your online order if ordering from this place!!!"}
{"text":"We get food delivered from streets of New York frequently.  The chicken is moist and tasty.  The New York sub is great.  My wife likes the cheese ravioli.  We got our order 3/11/16 and two items were wrong/ missing.  After a short talk with the manager, on the phone, the correct items were delivered.  Good going Streets of New York.  The correct items were to us in 30 minutes."}
{"text":"If your looking for a great sandwich shop and more, try this. I was pleasantly surprised, very good food, delivery was accurate and quick. I will definitely order from here again when I come back to town."}
{"text":"I am not one to leave negative reviews, but the service was extremely poor. Food took forever to come out. Taste was just fair. The server was understanding and apologized a few times and acknowledged that the kitchen staff has been extremely slow. Wings were cold. Definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"It's what you would expect of a chain restaurant: salads with ranch, burgers, and chicken sandwiches.  It gets crowded around dinner, so plan to wait a few minutes for a table.  The bar area fills up fast and no one under 21 is allowed.  Thus, do not try to nab a table when you're toting tots and/or teens.  You will be asked to sit elsewhere. 

I come here to have a drink with a light meal.  I have heard that this place serves great wings and I plan to try them soon.  The service is good, but you will find better food and good service almost anywhere."}
{"text":"Be extremely careful if you order an Antipasto Salad. If it is not very cold them it is possible that it has been stored warm after the meat and cheese has been prepared with bare hands. This combination of factors can cause Staph to grow. When you eat this food nausea starts followed by severe vomiting and reaching. It lasts for an hour. You can tell it is staph by how quickly you start with the vomiting. It was hard not to choke. In the end I was on the bathroom floor with towels I pulled down because I could not sit up because of the violent reaching had me flat. I called the health department and asked that he teach this establishment how to avoid this problem."}
{"text":"Slow service - we waited 15 minutes and no one came over to acknowledge us and take our drink order. We  were ready to walk out when a female server came over and asked us if we needed help - she says \"it is never this busy\" - although the place was only about 2/3 full. 
You can order pizza by the slice - but only the mushy \"New York style\", not the thin and crispy.
The ziti was okay but the complimentary \"passion bread\" was mushy garlic sticks.
The server did take the price of the pizza slice off our bill."}
{"text":"Broasters chicken...wow. Crispy, juicy and tender -
Fried chicken craving satisfied! Fries were just as crunchy. Yum"}
{"text":"I ordered a neatball sub, fries, and drink from their website.  Delivery was fast.  Instead of fries they brought chips and their sub roll was a little hard.  Still a great experience."}
{"text":"Every few weeks us girls at European wax center(Tropicana) order here for our Thursday team meetings and we are all obsessed with this pizza!!! They also have some amazing breadsticks with a little bit of cheese melted on top and some other magical ingredients. I can literally eat those breadsticks eveeerrrrrryday. Mmmmmm. Not only is their food amazing but their service is top notch! We are convinced that our delivery man is spider man (we saw his red webbed suit peaking underneath his t-shirt!). They are so nice and the food is soooo yummy. Thanks streets of New York pizza for making our Thursday team meeting full if deliciousness !!!! (:"}
{"text":"Food is great, service is fast and friendly, and atmosphere is nice. Great for family, friends, or work. Small tables, booths and large tables. Will be back again for sure"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!  How this business is the \"Official pizza of the Arizona Diamondbacks\" is beyond me.

Ordered twice, take out & delivery, the same thing: New York combo. The flavor was good, however, both times my pizza was not even cooked through. The dough was gummy and just nasty. The restaurant was dead on a Sunday evening...I was the only one there. Delivery on a Friday night was way too fast. I also had the Gorgonzola Pear salad. It was all dressing, not much lettuce at all. The pear dressing had an odd flavor. I think this salad is so \"popular\" because of the walnuts. Oh, and the sliced pears are canned, not fresh. 

For the $35 I spent both times it would have been nice to have a pizza that was cooked. I won't address my actual sit down experience inside the EMPTY Happy Valley location during lunch, but lets just say if I wanted cold bread & marinara I would have stayed home."}
{"text":"Ask anyone from downstate New York what one of their pet peeves are with respect to pizza, and they will tell you any place outside of New York that has the audacity to claim to serve New York style pizza--and then fails to live up to that expectation. Well, Streets of New York is one of those places. Born and raised in New York, and happened to live in Italy for several years, so, my family takes our pizza seriously. 

We decided to take a chance and order a pie from Streets of New York, hoping that an establishment which is boasting cuisine from our home state would live up to its name. The pizza arrived in under 30 minutes, which was about the only positive. We ordered an 18\" pie, and when we opened the box, it was a bit on the smallish side. The actual slices were so skinny. If you have ever had the opportunity to eat pizza from an authentic New York pizzeria, you would most definitely have felt cheated by this 'knock-off'. The crust was rubbery and a little thicker than New York pizza, the sauce was overly spiced, and the cheese was extremely salty for mozzarella. Unfortunately, what we received was a pizza that looked like it came from one of those franchise establishments that runs ads on television, or from the frozen section of a grocery store. It was a misrepresentation of pizza that would come from the real streets of New York. 

Needless to say, this New York family will not be ordering from Streets of New York again."}
{"text":"ordered here last night + was v impressed. the chicken parm + complimentary bread was delicious, delivery was quick + the worker on the phone/delivery lady were both very nice! will definitely order here from now on"}
{"text":"Excellent friday dinner . relaxing atmosphere - pizza was steaming hot & tasted great!!  The manager Laura rocks"}
{"text":"We've been coming here since they've opened and normally get pizza but today we had spaghetti and the pear salad with grilled chicken.  Very good!  And the service was great!  They have good lunch specials, and the funnel cake is a must have!"}
{"text":"We were the only ones here at 8:00pm and our service was slow!!  #frustrating After the delay in having the waitress even come take our order, she immediately pressured us about ordering an artichoke appetizer. How about not standing around talking to the cook and coming over in a reasonable time to take our order?   Ordered a pizza and a New York cheese steak sandwich which came at different times, about 8 minutes difference.... Not fun and poor service considering we really were the only ones there! Pizza sauce had no flavor. Surprised this place is even open,will not be back."}
{"text":"Almost cried. Other locations can be okay, but the delivery I got from this one was horrible. It will be a while before I go to any location after the experience I had here."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery from here last night seeing as I didn't feel like cooking dinner ;) The prices seemed a bit steep for a pizza place but seeing as I had a $5 off coupon, we decided to give it a try.

I ordered a large pepperoni, garden salad and a side of garlic cheese bread. The delivery man was super nice and polite. The pizza was good, piping hot and the perfect amount of toppings. The cheese was stringy and melty which I love. The crust was the perfect combination of chewy with just enough crispness so that it was not doughy. The garden salad was super fresh and delicious. The veggies were crunchy and tasted like the had just been picked. The only downfall was that they forgot the salad dressing ;( Luckily, I was able to find some at home. The garlic cheese bread was kind of bland, I didn't taste any garlic at all so I don't think we will be ordering that again.

Overall I think we will try this place again....hopefully next time they remember the salad dressing!"}
{"text":"I received contact back from the General Manager of the store Shi the following day after posting my original complaint. He had a completely separate version of the events than I was given by his driver and by Grubhub previously, but he did apologize for the way my order and subsequent complaints were handled, acknowledging that he should have taken a more personally involved role by contacting me directly  and offered to replace the order or provide a new lunch order if i would be willing to give them another try. 

I am skeptical, but since this is the only bad experience I have had with this chain I am planning to take him up on his offer of lunch today to see what can be repaired of a long time customer relationship. Wish us luck!"}
{"text":"We have been coming to Streets of New York for over 10 years, between various locations and where we went today, 59th Ave. & Thunderbird location and it was by far the worst experience we have ever had. We sat down at 12:35 pm and ordered within 2 minutes of sitting down, we ordered the same #3 Hot Roast beef sandwich. We always order it the same way with provolone cheese. It arrived at the table 45 minutes later, and it was cold. I don't understand what took so long since it wasn't cooked and there were only 4 other tables of 2 there.  We had to send it back to the kitchen and then it took another 10 minutes to get our food. Cheese was melted but the meat was still cold...NOT HAPPY AT ALL!!!! 

Told the waitress and after she talked to her manager, they took 25% off. WOW, I guess that's all it was worth to them to keep a customer happy. Won't go back to that location again!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is right down the middle, but the meatballs (pasta or sandwich) are to die for.  Officially addicted."}
{"text":"Great service! I just went here with my family and we arrived just before they closed. Instead of being annoyed that we were coming in so late, the waiter, Oskar, kindly made us feel very welcome, and then provided excellent service!"}
{"text":"Always great service!  Thin crust pizza is great as well.  Try a side salad and add some bruschetta on top!  Can't beat it.  The happy hour is a good deal too!"}
{"text":"Ordered wings to go...they said it would be 15 minutes...still waiting and its coming on 30 minutes.
I won't do this again."}
{"text":"If this gave me the option to do negative stars I would! I placed an order at 8:00 pm and was told it would be delivered by 9:00 pm. It's now 9:58... I have No pizza and the assistant manger had no glue how to cancel my transaction without the manger which was not answering his phone.  They had no actually way of resolving the problem Nd I'm left with a credit card charge and no food! 
Do not order from this place the service sucks and the staff was clueless!"}
{"text":"I enjoy streets of New York pizza a lot but I do lie stumps wings just a bit more but streets has great wings to"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible customer service!
When the smug girl on the phone took my order she failed to take my address for delivery. Assuming that they had it on file, I didnt even ask.

Failure one was not checking the address or even bothering to take one. 
After an hour and a half I called to see where my pizza was, and was told that she didn't have the right number or the right address. I could hear a guy in the background telling her to tell me she tried calling but had the wrong number.

Failure 2 and 3
Even if I wasn't lied to about them trying to call, its hard for me to believe that the caller ID couldn't have been matched to the order time to get a correct number.

The food has never been much more than convenient. But mediocre food and craptastic employees just lost me for good.
Don't give them your business."}
{"text":"Completely disappointed....ordered to go....spinach salad. It had no spinach in it....was all bitter greens. I called to let them know and was told I was wrong and it wasn't possible because the manager made my salad. Well.....it wasn't spinach,  yes it was green but not spinach.  They did offer to remake it but to late. So a credit was applied to my phone number. Just annoyed that they didn't believe me!"}
{"text":"On way home from downtown and wife had a taste for one of their shrimp pizzas. Called and got put on hold for 5 1/2 mins then got hung up on. Called back and put on hold again even after I told him I had just been on hold. Another 3 Mins and then they need all my info for computer.  By the the time got my order in I was there. On top of that they don't even have the pizza my wife wanted on menu any more.  
Then when I arrived and asked to pay he said he had no orders for me. Took another look and there was my order. 
Tables empty and people waiting at door for seat 15 minutes. I wont go back. Pizza was expensive and not that good."}
{"text":"Earlier this evening, I placed an order through grub hub for an 18 inch pepperoni pizza, And the beer batter combo. Online, with grub hub, It gave me the option to have the combo be only cheese sticks, which I selected. I placed the order, and proceeded to wait for my order to arrive. After nearly an hour, my food did arrive. 

I paid for my order in cash, took it inside, and set it down. I had to finish a phone call, about 5 minutes or so. Once I finished, I opened my food. ALL of it was cold. The pizza, and the beer battered combo. AND my combo was the actual combo, and not just cheese sticks. I was rather upset at this point. 

So after contacting grub hub, I was told by them to call and speak to the manager Patrick. They told me he would be willing to compensate me for the issue. I thanked them, and called immediately. 

Patrick proceeded to make me feel like I was a moron for placing my order how I did. He kept interrupting me, and telling me that I shouldn't have ordered the combo, and that there were other ways to order, not listening when I told him my reason for doing so was because it gave me the option to only do one item instead of three. He then proceeded to blame grub hub, for not updating their menu on their end, saying they had sent it in to them repeatedly. 

THEN he asked what time I placed my order, and proceeded to tell me it wasn't their fault my food was cold, because he only had two drivers working and it was football night, and i should have expected it to be cold essentially. At this point, I was greatly insulted and upset, and he proceeded to say all he was willing to do was offer a 10 dollar credit to my account. 

All he was WILLING to do. Then he threw out all the last remaining good will I had, by explaining multiple times as if I was a child or mentally challenged, that I can't order online if I want to use the credit. That I have to call the store. Do I understand him? Call the store. Don't order online. About 3 times he said this. 

This is NOT what I would call a good customer service experience. I'd go so far as to say this is one of the rudest/worst customer service experiences I've had to date."}
{"text":"This place works for me, always friendly, pizza is great, folks behind counter are always polite, and they have local beer on tap!!"}
{"text":"Ordered over $50 of delivery and it arrived 1 hr 45 min. Later. The delivery driver said They sent a slice of chocolate cake & cheese cake as an apology. I was so happy and apprecited this jesture, since i order several times a month and this time was an exceptionally long wait.    Then he came back 5 minutes later banging on our door and demanded the cakes back, we had already opened them, but he wanted them stating they were for someone else. What a joke. I'm so disappointed in this location. :("}
{"text":"I ordered through door dash. Usually great service from both sides. However, this time was horrid. My girlfriend and I ordered three dozen wings for some fun with some friends of ours, and they were cold when they arrived! On top of that they were hard and the breading was soggy."}
{"text":"This place has an awesome lunch deal: six wings and a slice of pizza for around $8. I've been here a few times and very satisfied every time. The other prices can seem a bit steep at first, but the taste makes it worth while.

The customer service is impressive too. The employees were quick with my orders and made me feel welcomed. The only complaint I'd have to say are the hours. I wish they'd be open until midnight; I usually get back from work around 10 p.m. Either way, I like to go on my days off."}
{"text":"Excellent service, superb food! We had an excellent time on our first visit - this will be our new local for pizza!"}
{"text":"We felt like Italian tonight.. really wish we'd gone elsewhere though..

Our party numbered three tonight so we each ordered somethin different.
 1: calzone with 3 toppings =$12.00
 2: Italian beef sandwich with pasta salad=$9.95
 3: antipasto=$10.95
 1 water, 1 ice tea & 1 rootbeer $2.70 per drink..
Total bill was just over $40.00
Not really bad for three people.. as long as the food and service are good..

We had the short ,dark haired waitress(avoid her if possible).

The first round of drinks was fine. But we had to be rather obvious to get refills. The second ice tea made us all choke(yes we all tried it).

The menu stated that eat in customers received complimentary cheese bread.. we never did.. we sat watching as the other waitress brought out basket after basket of bread to her tables.. our waitress stood eating and drinking and chatting..the other waitress actually took care of her customers.

As for the food.. a waste of money for the most part..
We all tried everything we ordered and agreed that the only things we liked were the calzone and pasta salad.
The antipasto was okay but not worth the cost.
The Italian beef sandwich was awful. It tasted of blood but the meat was over cooked. It lacked any other flavor..

We saw no reason to complain as we doubted anything would have been done.

I actually hated leaving the $5.00 tip for our waitress but I didn't have any smaller bills.. I wouldn't have left a tip at all but I feared a scene with the waitress.. She seemed the type to complain about the lack and chase after you when you left..

All in all.. we won't be back.. and I'll be sure to warn my friends.."}
{"text":"This place has awesome food! They have really good pizza, but they have other great options too. My favorite is the passion cookie dessert. You also get free bread, which is always a perk. My family and I come here all the time and we always have a good experience!"}
{"text":"This is such a great family place.  Super kid friendly and sports on TV for the hubby.  The pizzas are great and the staff are friendly.  My son helped me write this review."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon. Place was nice and clean, not crowded at all. Loved the 90's music they played. 
We got a chopped antipasta salad & the New Yorker combo pizza. The pizza was pretty dang good. 
The salad however was disappointing. Especially when it costs $10.75! It was like they took two bags of different salads threw in some meat & chopped up bell peppers & dressing. If you want a good antipasta salad go to Grimaldi's in Summerline....their salad is WAY better. 
For the pizza (we got a large, salad & 2 drinks it was $40.12). I was surprised it was $5.00 for just two damn diet cokes! 
When we left we asked for drinks to go and only my man got one. Lol ok 
Overall the food was good."}
{"text":"Blah Blah..Where do I begin?? Well lets start off with the basics. This used to be a Bravi Pizza joint on the Northwest corner of Germann & Gilbert just off the SanTan 202 loop... 

AS for the food.. My wife and I ordered the \"combo\" app.. It had Zukes, Mozz Cheese sticks and Onion Rings.. Not bad, interesting flavors of batter. Served with ranch. Oh they served some sort of bread thing with a little garlic or something.. Stale and cold. The only thing that was warm was the marinara.. 

We ordered a 14\" pizza with pepperoni.. The umm pizza showed up GREASY.. Above and below.. Sauce or crust or cheese or roni's were salty, or all the above. The crust had a flavor of garlic butter, at least we think it did.

I hate to give 1 star for my first time ever at a SNY, but next time we will go to Patsy Grimaldi's instead and stick with REAL pizza! 

We won't be going back anytime ever!"}
{"text":"Love Streets but this location is struggling. The waitress could care less, the wings tasted like rubber and the pizza wasn't good. Add in the fact that they were renovating the place, this was one of the worst experiences we had eating out as a family. THIS LOCATION - PASS"}
{"text":"My friend found the place and asked me to meet him there for dinner.  What is interesting about this pizza place is they also offer Broaster chicken.  Now if you are from the mid-west you know what this is, if not you need to order this chicken.  The pizza is great and so are their salads.  I met the owner and she is a really good person and everything from the eating areas to the bathroom are sparkling clean.  The menu is friendly to any persons taste and accommodations."}
{"text":"Food here is usually pretty good. The three stars are for the service.   We have stopped going there because of this. It always seems as if the customer is an inconvenience.  Too bad because we used to like this place."}
{"text":"Great food and outstanding service. The NY combo and cheese pizza were our choices and they were delicious. Would definitely go back. Not to mention, they have great prices for happy hour."}
{"text":"I love streets turkey sub best in the game defiantly need to come and try there food they have some really good food I like this place and they have the greatest servers too"}
{"text":"Worst place ever. Ordered once and got really old chicken and fries. Plus half of the order was missing. Driv4er came back with some very old fries. Decided to try them again one more time. Got my delivery and the order was completely wrong ( the chicken was dried out and very old AGAIN!). Tried contacting restaurant and corporate office regarding my experiences and they refuse to get back with me. Dont waste your money here. Their food is old and disgusting!!!!!"}
{"text":"My gf was not in the mood for pizza so we decided to get carryout for Leticia's across the street...I told her I'd meet her inside wanting a salad and to at least try something as I've been wanting to try out the food since we moved on this side of town. I ordered a chopped Greek with no olives. I met her and we ordered our Mexican food...after our food came out I went back here to pick up the salad, it wasn't ready so as I waited another carryout came up missing a slice I felt terrible for the girl at the counter she apologized went back to the kitchen where the younger kid with headphones in seemed irritated that she even came back there...she politely came back and apologized to the guy and explained it would take a few more minutes...she then apologized to me and said she would check on the salad..again he seemed bothered she even came back....I decided to go pick my car up and pull it to a closer spot that had opened...when I came back and grabbed my salad and got it home I got the most half assed salad with olives on it..obviously he just wanted it out of the kitchen and for her to stop checking on it...so irritated by the experience and having no desire to pick olives out of this 13 dollar with tip, salad I just pitched it after taking the picture and enjoyed our Mexican food.. delicious btw...I gave 2 stars because alot of the food looked good at the tables and because of how great the girl was despite the trials she has to deal with from the kitchen....that being said I doubt I'd order this salad even made to a high standard, to describe a chopped Greek with generic lettuce un chopped and this size seems like a fetch when many places offer a larger higher quality of a salad for a few bucks cheaper...I don't care about the few bucks but it Insulting at that price for a salad"}
{"text":"Been coming here for a while. I really like there pizzas and sandwiches. I always order the everything sandwich which is delicious. Now the reason for 3 stars is not because of there food but there service. It has gone down a bit lately. Now I usually just order for pick up or delivery. If you eat there expect below average service."}
{"text":"Fresh hot breadsticks dipped in marinara....DELICIOUS !!  Everyone was friendly and courteous. Our waitress, Meagan, was efficient and attentive. She wasn't afraid to tell us her menu favorites, which is always appreciated. We will be coming here more often."}
{"text":"Whatever you do, do NOT order delivery from this location. They will show up 45 minutes late with congealed Alfredo sauce(wrong by the way) and the refuse to fix the order because they are closed. This was after calling twice to be told it should be there any minute for it to show up 20 minutes later. The manager was useless. At least grubhub customer service is amazing and processed the refund right away and gave me a credit. Definitely won't be order here again."}
{"text":"Ordered one thing- a pizza. Got there to pick it up. They got the order wrong. Then they overcharged me. Offered to give me a credit for the next time. Won't go back."}
{"text":"I had dinner at Streets of New York on Fort Apache Sat. night. Stacy who was friendly and attentive, waited on us. My husband ordered the chicken parmesan and was pleasantly surprised. He was very happy with his choice. I had a salad and wings and was also impressed. The restaurant was clean and located on the corner of a fairly new strip mall. Its roomy, casual and family oriented. We were in no hurry to leave, as the place has a nice atmosphere, so we stayed and had a couple of beers. It was very enjoyable. I thought the service was excellent, the food was great, and the restaurant itself is very nice. I recommend Streets of New York. We had dinner, but Im sure lunch is probably equally good."}
{"text":"Went to this establishment this weekend and had an interesting experience. Such a great greeting when I first walked on by a tall blonde girl who was extremely nice and personable. I had a pleasant conversation with her when I got in and was very pleased with the kindness. My service by Presley was a perfect experience. She was one of, if not the best server I've had in my history of dining experiences. She brought me the food immediately after it was put on the counter and we never had an empty cup on the table! She was super kind to me and my family and she overall made my dining experience one of the best. Unfortunately the food wasn't very good, but the service made it so much better by both ladies. As I was leaving I went to compliment my service to a worker and I was informed that she will be switching jobs soon. I guess we'll have to follow her to her new job so we can continue with only the best customer service."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, SAVE YOUR MONEY! We ordered the garlic chicken calzone and have never been more disappointed. I'm not really a picky eater and it's rare that I complain about food but this was disgusting. This is an Italian restaurant so you'd think they would have at least the dough down, WRONG. This was a disgusting excuse for a calzone. Soggy dough, zip loc Oscar Meyer pepperoni, Ragu Alfredo sauce over loaded with garlic. I've never seen a more sad calzone. I will NEVER recommend this place to anyone I know. It sucks because it's so close to our house (within walking distance) but we will never return. This dinner made my boyfriend and I sick for two days. Thank you Streets of New York for living up to your standard, we thought you'd prove us wrong."}
{"text":"Pros: WE DO LOVE their delivery service (Always on time) and online ordering service.  We love their standard pizza with extra ingredients.  

The salads are great especially the Cobb Salad.

The calzones are very good also.


Cons: We do not go to the dinning room because of the small size.  Their subs on takeout do not rate very highly."}
{"text":"Wow just wow! I ordered 24 wings and LG fries and got  18 wings and very small amount of fries. Wasn't even enough to feed me and my 12 year old! Complete waste of my hard earned money. Absolutely ridiculous!!!"}
{"text":"Good Lunch specials, pretty standard fare. Pizza was good, crisp crust, savory sauce, a bit too greasy for my preference but a pretty above-par slice. Caesar salad wasn't anything to write about. Wings were baked and the sauce isn't really 'sauce' but some strange vinegar baked on spice blend. 
Had worse, but definitely not anything I'd order again. 

Every table gets some parmesan cheese breadstick bits with dipping sauce, greasy stuff, but tasty. Lots of parmesan, salty, with a cup of marinara which was savory and made with tomato chunks instead of a puree, same as the pizza sauce. 

Beers on tap, but no Peroni, draft or bottle. Sacrilege for an italian restaurant. Great service, fast and friendly. Worth noting at least."}
{"text":"They bring out bread and marinara sauce. The marinara has clearly had water added to make it go further. I ordered the lasagna, and it was the worst think I have ever been served at a restaurant. The lasagna comes out in a bowl and its a continuation of the runny marinara, tons of cheese, a bit of sausage (seemed like from the pizza toppings), and about four small noodles. The waitress never asked how it was, and I am sure I know why. she would probably not serve this dish to her dog. To add insult to stomach injury, the dish is $12! Way too expensive and I feel ripped off."}
{"text":"The Pizza is usually good, however, quite overpriced.  In my experience, the service has been very poor.  A large group of ladies from our church meet for an annual Mom's lunch during the first week of school - where everyone buys their own and about 20 people or so eat and chat.  We met at this location two years in a row and it was ok.  The third year when we showed up the waitress was very put out.  She rudely told us that she was the only person there (why would a restaurant staff only one person for lunch?)  and that if we were going to stay that she would only do one bill and that it would take quite a bit of time to serve all of us.  Because we had communicated to meet at this location quite broadly, we stayed and ended up ordering a couple of pizzas and soda, paying around $75 plus the 20% tip for a large group.  The sad thing is, when everyone paid on their own, the orders were generally around $10 each and then they all left a good tip.  The waitress would have fared much much better financially.  Needless to say, we have moved our annual Mom's lunch to another local pizza place who is very accommodating.
Additionally, my family has attempted to order online several times - something we do regularly with Dominos, Pizza Hut and others without any issue.  Every time we have tried at Streets of New York, we go to pick it up at the time given us online, and the staff is like, \"oh, we missed this. Do you want to wait while we make it?\"  We would have already have waited 30 mins for them to process the online order - no I don't want to wait another 30 mins. I will NOT try again here.  It's just not worth it when I can easily do it somewhere else for much cheaper and never have an issue."}
{"text":"NEW MANAGEMENT, FINALLY!!!  The food has always been better than average.  I actually like their pizza when it's hot out of the oven.  New managers and servers have recently helped this place revive their image.  If you have good food, but a poor manager that treats their employees without respect, it's not a place you want to go back to.  Things are different now.  Prices and food has always been good.  Now you can also have a pleasant experience either eating there, or getting it delivered.  I've been in Anthem for 10 years.  We stopped going here for a while, but still got good delivery.  Reasonable prices for the area, and local owners who are there all the time.  Congrats on changing management.  Will eat at the restaurant again."}
{"text":"Very little value.  We had been customers for the past 15 years.  Under it's current management it's a complete ripoff."}
{"text":"This place used to be so good, ordered 2 half orders of sandwiches with 6 wings. Both orders of wings were burnt. Last time we eat wings there, same scenario the last time. Just thought we would give it another try. Prices keep going up, but quality going down."}
{"text":"Decided to try a new place. Ordered a Cesar salad and a cheese pizza. Pretty simple order. It was delivered within 25 minutes which is good. Unfortunately the salad was pretty sad. Warm romaine lettuce with bottles dressing, whoopie. The cheese pizza was for some reason cut into 16 squares (14 inch round pizza) and was cold. So I'm guessing it's been sitting around for a bit. Way more sauce than cheese, crust was like hardened cardboard. Looks like a Red Baron frozen pizza that's been sitting on the counter for an hour. Total bummer. Gotta eat it because I paid for it but really? So many better places within the same distance. Disappointed I gave it a try. 14 bucks for a crappy medium pizza is pretty bad. This is nothing like the pizza from the \"streets of New York\". Maybe it was a bad batch but I'm really disappointed. Guess I'll stick to the other joints."}
{"text":"Terrible online order experience. Food was late, missing and overdone to the point of tasting bad. Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Greek salad is too wet but the pizza was good.  The waitress had to add more salad to compensate for the drenched salad.  The pizza was good and wings were ok."}
{"text":"Uh, don't order a slice of pizza at lunch, they have no problem serving you some old crusty pizza they had laying around. Thats my impression of what i got the last and only time i ate there. I hope they do a better job when you throw down a big order for your baseball team."}
{"text":"Sports games on every T.V., ice cold beer on tap, spicy wings and a steaming 18in Dback; I couldn't ask for a better night. The atmosphere was perfect for my family of four, the staff acted like we were family, and the food hit the spot! I know this is an Arizona chain but it is locally owned. The owner was our waitress and I could tell she puts her heart into her business. Streets made me feel as if I lived in a small town and  was a regular that came to eat every week! Go and enjoy the game, food, and beer, but most of all enjoy yourself!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on a whim while we were driving by.  Everything we tried was quite good.  In particular, the beer cheese soup with the passion bread stood out.  

I found out later that this is a small chain, but I don't think you would suspect that when you visit - at least I didn't.  The restaurant has a nice ambiance, but there are things that aren't corporate polished, which I liked.  

Prices are moderate to slightly above what you might expect to pay.  This restaurant should be on everyone's radar to try out.  I look forward to making a return visit."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!!!!!  This place has THE WORST service I have ever experienced in my life. We go in and sit down it takes 20 min for the waitress to finally come by and ask for our drinks. We say no and she leaves and comes back 5 mins later with a bus person to take the drink order. WTF???  We orders our drinks they came out right away. We place our order. 20 mins later no food. 10 more minutes still no food. How long does it take to make a pizza and a ham sandwich? A total of 55 minutes goes by and we still don't have our food. This after we have asked 4 times \" do you know when our order is going to be up\"? \" meanwhile I see customers that were seated at least 10 to 15 minutes after is getting their meals. Finally the food is here and they mess up the sandwich. The pizza  is horrible. So is the sandwich. I have had better meals off of a construction lunch truck. We ask for the check. We ask forte check 2 more times. The  check comes and it is over charged by $33. The waitress has the nerves to tell us that we ordered all of this. I want to point out that at this point a manager has never come over. After 10 mins of arguing with the waitress about the chargesy wife also notices  there is a %15 gratuity charged on top of this. I am not a cheap person and I tip very well. But I will not tip for the a job or a service that does not deserve it. Any ways we ask to have that removed from the bill also . She says she can't because the system will not allow it. Still no manager. Finally we demand to see a manager and are told that they are too busy to come and speak to us. I ask to see the owner who I know is in the building( our kids played baseball together) and was told that she doesn't care and that she does not have it time to come over and speak with us because she is off. A manger finally comes over and hands us back the bill minus the gratuity and the 33$ over charges and then asks us to never come back again. Wow you treat us badly and you ask us never to return. Don't you worry we will never come back to your establishment and I will forever bad mouth you to who ever will listen. YOUR FOOD SUCKS!  YOUR SERVICE SUCKS!! YOUR ATTITUDES SUCK!!! Basically you suck!!"}
{"text":"Terrible. 2 pizzas, and one order of wings $69! The pizza was dry-no sauce and just plain bland. The wings were old and tasted worse than frozen wings heated in the microwave. I am a previous owner of two restaurants and I know what old chicken wings look and taste like. This experience was shockingly bad. The delivery was quite fast--less than 20 minutes, which tells me we got old wings and pizza most likely. I will spend my hard earned money on better pizza elsewhere with better prices. The worst pizza experience I have had in Phoenix to date There are too many good pizza joints out there, so please try others before you order from this place."}

My girlfriend and I Live in manhattan and have been stuck here for the past 4 days due to hurricane sandy.  We decided we wanted Italian tonight and were pleased to see a \"new York\" themed place that actually offered calzones all the way out here in Arizona.  Upon calling we were asked the usual: name, adress, phone number, and once I explained that we were staying at the Marriott and gave the exact physical address of \"200 centennial way\" I was asked by the employee on the phone \"which Marriott are you at\" and he went on to explain there were several.  I repeated myself, \"the one that is located at 200 centennial way\".  He then asked me \"is that the big one or the small one\". Dumbfounded I explained calmly that I had no idea the size of my hotel in comparison to another one nor should he expect that I would have that knowledge as I am obviously from out of town since I am staying at a hotel!  He then had the audacity to suggest that I ask someone.... YEA SURE MAN, LEMME RUN DOWN TO THE LOBBY REAL QUICK EVENTHOUGH I JUST GAVE YOU THE EXACT ADDRESS 3 TIMES!  I became so frustrated that I just said forget it and hung up.
Upon reviewing our other Italian choices in the area we decided that we were dead set on calzones and i decided to have my girflriend call back from a different number, place our order for pick-up and then hire a driver to bring me there and back.  I must admit I was driven to go this far out of my way to explain the stupidity of the person I talked to on the phone to their manager, after I had paid for and accepted my food.
Once my food was paid for I asked to speak to the manager and I explained how I was treated on the phone.  He went on to explain to me that there were several marriotts in the area and that they would need the exact address of the hotel.  And for a second time I repeated to him, 200 centennial way.  He followed with \"yes but that is near main street and there are 2 different Marriott near main street\". And again, I repeated, \"THAT IS NICE BUT I AM AT THE ONE THAT IS LOCATED AT THE EXACT ADDRESS OF 200 CENTENIAL WAY\"..... I Seriously felt like I was talking to someone who hadn't graduated a kindergarten.  I was in disbelief.  I then asked him if it was common practice for their delivery men to use GPS and he responded yes, to which I followed \"WELL THEN WHY WOULDN'T THAT ADDRESS WORK??\". He then asked me to leave the store... Didn't offer me a dime back towards the driver I had to hire because of his establishments incompetence, just asked me to leave because as far as I could tell I stumped him with the common sense of an 8 year old.  Unreal..... Not to mention I wasn't given any takeaway utensils to eat our food with,  and as far as the food goes, it was awful and anyone from new York would challenge a pizza place that had the boldness to reference the region in its name..... Awful awful awful.
.. Don't give this place your business. Hey mr manager you see this review and have a problem?  feel free to email me at joeletz@hotmail.com"}
{"text":"Ordered a couple of calzones for delivery. They were fantastic. We had been lounging in the backyard when driver showed up so didn't hear him knock. He had to call. Nice guy, great food."}
{"text":"We have been enjoying this Streets of NY Location for years and it never disappoints.  Jimmy, the manager has the place running like a watch and he is usually there and quite attentive, greeting and visiting with regulars.  Today I stopped in for a quick lunch. Was immediately greeted by Jimmy.  Our server (and I am sorry I do no remember her name) come right up and says \"iced tea as usual\"? followed by are you going to have your usual slice of pepperoni with a caesar side salad?\"  I hadn't been in a quite a while, yet she remembered what I normally order.  The salad was cold and crisp.  The pizza was hot and tasty.  Excellent as usual.  Today's experience reminded me why i have been coming here for so long & why I will continue to do so.  Kudos to Jimmy for having a fun and warm place with great food. Sure there are restaurants which are newer and more trendy, but this is a truly a place that feels a lot more like \"Cheers\" than a national chain."}
{"text":"I went here 3 times within the last few weeks and it was the same story every time. A waiter or waitress who was bitching they had been alone on the floor all day, yet even though they only had a couple tables were more inclined to talk to other employees than help us/serve us in a timely manner. All times drinks went dry and we waited forever for our check till I finally got up and stood up front. Pizza was good but wings were horrible, reheated sauce dumped on top cold on the plate. Waste of money and time which is too bad because we used to love this place and go there a lot. The place was a total mess too. Smelled and dirty tables floors etc everywhere yuck!"}
{"text":"Tried this place the other night. The table was sticky (ew!) and they were out of wings. The atmosphere needs a serious update. Bummer because other locations close by are way nicer."}
{"text":"I'm always in search of a good pizza place and unfortunately this isn't it. I ordered 2 pizza's to go. One was their combo and the other a thin crust cheese pizza with black olives. Their thin crust was like a cracker and had no taste, the sauce was very dark and had the consistency of tomato paste and a flavor I didn't like. Plus they cut a round pizza into squares. Is this a NY thing? I've been to NY numerous times in the past and loved getting a big slice of cheese pizza while walking down Time's square, I don't recall the crust being like a cracker or being cut into squares. I remember having to fold the slice to eat it and having gooey good cheese dripping off. The combo wasn't any better, it had a thicker flavorless crust and the same sauce that was a bit too sweet and hardly any cheese. Very sad, because this place is within minutes of where I live but I won't be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"Good food, but don't go there for Happy Hour! All of the prices online are NOT the actual prices.  They have ALL gone up and they didn't honor the price.  We went there for a good deal but left paying almost the same price as a regular meal that wasn't happy hour!"}
{"text":"Well I'm going to jump right in to it. If a restaurant is 100% empty at 12:00 pm get out, if LITERALLY THE SAME FOUR SONGS ARE PLAYING ON REPEAT... ZERO EXAGGERATION, get out, if you thought it would be a good idea (like I did) and you use the restroom and it's not very clean get out... or stay like I did like an absolute idiot. Two slices of pizza and six wings took 25+ min... WE WERE THE ONLY ONES IN THE EXTREMELY SMALL ESTABLISHMENT! Food came... pizza was complete crap, lets be honest, it was soooo bland... you could get better at a Peter Piper. Did I mention that I found the most \"delicious\" piece of hair on my wings... I genuinely can't continue the review.... done, screw off Streets of New York. *ZERO STARS*"}
{"text":"Great service, happy hour prices are good (Metro is cheaper though), pizza is good, and the wife really likes the chicken. 

The only real con is they don't deliver.
Update: they do deliver, but the experience wasn't exactly satisfactory, will try once more then update the review."}
{"text":"Side salad had lots of real cut veggies, not just iceberg lettuce like some other places. I will return just for this. Kids liked what they got. I liked the veggie marinara spaghetti I got. Not so keen on the pizza though. Service was slow, but kind."}
{"text":"I love their food from the pizza to the dinners, its is always yummy, tastes fresh like a pizzeria should be.  The service is always spot on and very friendly."}
{"text":"Just had the Broasted Chicken 4 piece lunch.  Quick service.  Clean atmosphere.  easy access.  try this place....had great server and gave her a call out as well."}
{"text":"Good pizza tasty crust very good I called in to order a pizza to go they tell me it will be ready in ten minutes I arrive in about ten minutes I didn't expect my order to be ready ten minutes is too fast I paid my bill and was told pizza was not quite ready yet iwaited another twenty minutes for my order waitress didn't check once while I was waiting they shouldn't tell you ten minutes when it was closer to thirty."}
{"text":"LOVE the pizza... staff is amazing, friendly and courteous!!  Can't wait to come back :-) :-) :-)"}
{"text":"We have come to the restaurant a couple of time and have had delivery and I am sick and tired of every single time something being wrong. Tonight was the breaking point. We decided to order for delivery because we had 4 kids and dint want to drag them to a busy restaurant on a Saturday night. Every single thing was wrong with out order besides the 2 philly sandwiches. I order a #1 with no tomatoes. Well I got tomatoes and no dressing. We did not receive any of our ranch dressing for our 3 orders of chicken strips or our kids drinks. I decided I should call and get my sandwich fixed. Yeah bad idea! The manger (or whoever) decided to tell me that the delivery guy was \"pissing him off\" (real professional). Then told me it would be another 20 min before I would get my dressing, drinks and new sandwich. Finally the delivery guy shows up, pissed off at me, and delivers me a ICE COLD sandwich. SERIOUSLY??? I will never ever eat at this place again."}
{"text":"Picked up my last pizza Oder today from Streets of NY.  They told me the order would take 25 minutes.  I was there in 20.  What I got was a cold over cooked pizza with very well done wings.  I asked for an extra blue cheese for the wings and was told it would be an extra 50 cents.  Never had to pay before.  Not a good sign when only about four tables with people for dinner at 7pm.  They need to go back to New York to see how it's done.  Too bad, it used to be a good place."}
{"text":"Worst delivery ever. Order 2 simple things was told 30-45 min which is find. Don't here anything for an hour an a half so I call them back to see if it was on it way or what is going on. The lady that answered was extremely rude and didn't care one dam bit.  Said o well it's on it's way and said she didn't care one dam bit. Really over an hour behind and nothing.  She said she could cancel it if I wanted to but after and hour and half my family and I were just hungry. The lady that answered the phone needs to learn some manners and customers service. Got off the phone another 15 min later the driver got to our house.  Still had to pay full price. Well we started eating we'll not worth the 30 bucks we paid. It was a shit load of noddles a bit of sauce and one tiny piece of chicken. On top of it all it was cold and the chicken was so dry it was like eating sand from the desert.  Do not order from this worthless hole that can't deliver anything even close to on time or even warm."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever.   This is the third time messing up a delivery order and the girl answering the phone could care less.  The first time it took an hour and a half and the sandwiches were soaked through with dressing.  The second time they forgot the dressing completely, and now the wings are undercooked.  I will never order takeout from this location again."}
{"text":"I loved it! I love food :) would come back again but find one in my area. Brought the boyfriend out for date night. When is it a good time to have free pizza. Anytime!!! Lmao but yes the coupon was worth the trip and the food. Just wish I wasn't too full. Wanted to try the cheesecake. Boo! 

Need time I'm \"here\" definitely want to try the salad."}
{"text":"We ordered take out tonight and when I called in the order, they said it would be ready in 15 minutes. Unfortunately that was 40 minutes ago and my husband is still there waiting for our food. I won't write a negative review on the first time this happens, but this is the second time it has happened. The first time we dined in and ordered wings and pizza. We got and finished eating pizza before the wings were even ready. We reminded the server multiple times and she kept saying \"they will be up shortly.\" Over promising and under delivering seems to be the name of the game here. Bummer."}
{"text":"Streets of NY never let's me down. If you are in the mood for some mouth watering pizza then you won't be disappointed. Best part about Streets of New York is leftover Streets of New York. A large pizza is enough to share and still take some home. Its a great feeling knowing that I have a delicious pizza to go home to when I get off work."}
{"text":"My friend from Arizona suggested I try out the wings, he had heard there was a location in Vegas. I went to the Streets of New York website to check out the menu and saw that they have Happy Hour, clicked on the link for the Happy Hour Menu. The website states, \"Enjoy food and drink specials from 2:30 pm to 6 pm, Monday through Friday at all Streets of New York locations!\" Cool!!! I had even preselected my order in my mind.

I arrived at the restaurant around 3:40 pm on Friday. I walked in and the waitress was on the phone and saw the sign to seat yourself. After awhile the waitress greets me and I ask about the Happy Hour menu (there are no signs mentioning a happy hour anywhere). She said, \"There is no Happy Hour on Friday.\" Since, this was my first time here and thought to myself maybe I misread the website. I was still able to order from the lunch specials (10:30 am to 4:00 pm). Ordered the 6 wings and a slice, soda, and a slice of the pumpkin cheesecake.

I loved the wings! They were meaty, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, just the right amount of sauce, and great buffalo flavor. I liked the crust of the pizza but it didn't seem like there was any sauce and it tasted dry. The pumpkin cheesecake was dreamy! It was light, creamy and the pumpkin flavor was subtle.

I will be back for more wings and cheesecake for sure! I would also like to try more items during Happy Hour, apparently not on a Friday though. Like previous reviewers the wait staff seemed to be going through the motions and not especially welcoming. I would given a rating of 4 stars for the food only but downgraded based on service and false advertisement of Monday through Friday Happy Hour."}
{"text":"Was not to happy after ordering from here. Waited over an hour and got cold pizza and burnt wings. For a large pizza 12 wings and a salad was $52! Wasn't worth it especially for burnt and cold food"}
{"text":"Very disappointing!!  The food is good but too expensive and not good enough to wait and hour and 45 minutes for a cold pizza to arrive.  When I called to let them know it was cold I was put on hold for almost 5 minutes because they were on another call.  I was offered a whopping 20% off my next order.  No thank you, there will not be another order ever.  Very poor customer service!"}

{"text":"The service was pretty good, however, I came in at a slow time of the day. Yay they have WiFi. Ordered an Italian beef sandwich and the meat tasted slightly burned and dry even after soaking in the juice."}
{"text":"When you spend $40 on two pizzas they better be good. Wellllll, don't bother with the Margherita. All it consists of is soggy tomatoes and cheese. Basically no basil to speak of and no \"splash of balsamic\". How can you charge these prices for such a pitiful product?! Boo."}
{"text":"Wow, amazing service and the most delicious pizza and pasta I've had in a long time! Pizza was picture-perfect and the regular crust had a nice crisp bottom. Smelled amazing and tasted even better. Our waiter was so attentive and genuinely nice, he got a 20%+ tip. Will come here again soon. This is the East Shea location."}
{"text":"Not great on many levels...we have been a couple times before and it was good but this time it was bad enough that I won't bother to go again.
It was very warm inside it felt like the a/c was almost off but maybe we should have sat under a ceiling fan. I ordered the chicken Parmesan, the pasta was ok but the chicken was so terribly dried out it really ruined the dish.  The free bread used to be a highlight but that was aweful as well, again it was dry.  The Service was horrible too, the waitress was pleasant but she had way too much to take care of so we were left waiting for drinks, to place our order, the food and the bill.
Really disappointed overall and won't be back."}
{"text":"What an awful place. I am a vegetarian and they kept making a pizza with pepperoni.  After 2 attempts, the waiter told me \"there was a language barrier with the cooks\"

So very, very sad"}
{"text":"I love this place Super friendly staff and amazing food The owners Stacey and Robin treat you like family
This place ROCKS"}
{"text":"This place has the best Chicken Parmegian and Meat Sauce in all of Las Vegas.  Fast Delivery, savory food, and the best, sweetest, most personable owner and servers ever!  Robin and her sister, Stacy, is what this city needs.  Anyone watch D'backs Baseball?  They're the best pizza place in AZ too!  This is a HUGE chain of restaurants from Arizona!!  We're blessed to have them here in Vegas now!!  Great crust on the pizza too!  And saucy!"}
{"text":"If you want pizza, go anywhere else, anywhere! This was some of the greasiest salty unsatisfying pizza I've ever had. There are much better pizza joints around.  I've only had there pizza but that was enough for me to never go back. The patio outside is pretty cool thats why it got 2 stars instead of one."}
{"text":"For good Italian food, DO NOT go here!  The food is very greasy, under seasoned and sometimes even cold.  Yuck!  Service was so/so, price was OK I guess considering we didn't like anything we got.  And to top it all off my husband got sick to his stomach for 2 days after we ate there."}
{"text":"The food is great, but the Ambiance is not working for the holiday season. The decor has not change since I moved here 4 years ago. The sun beats in on the side. It would be nice if there were blinds or canopy over the outdoor area."}
{"text":"Live Guitar Music: Friday & Saturday nights from 6:00 pm to 9:00 pm. 60's and 70's music.  It's just fabulous.  Come see for yourself.  In the Fry's Shopping Center in Anthem, Arizona.  Contact the owner at an time.  He would be pleased to meet with you over dinner during the week.  And thank you"}
{"text":"this place at first seemed like it wasn't going to interest me but since i was short of time to eat before getting back to work i decided to give it a shot. Considering im from chicago a new york style pizza i figured couldn't impress me any more than the prices that target has to offer now a days. when i stepped in the door i was immediately greeted by a young man w/ a sincere smile, he brought me to my table and before you new it my drink was ready & order being giving to the kitchen. the server was very attentive i found out because i guess he saw me looking at my watch and new i had a time limit to get back to work do to when the food came quickly so did my check. He politely said it was for my conveinance incase i was on a lunch break. I was amazed!! he also asked me for my name since he had never seen me there before and made me feel very welcome. I ended up going back to work very satisfied and planned on returning to the streets again on my next lunch break to enjoy another exsperience with that server named Jon"}
{"text":"I was hungry and in an unfamiliar part of town.  Decided to stop by Streets of New York since I've never eaten at any of their locations in town.  Not in the mood for pizza, I instead ordered \"The Best of Everything\" sub with a side of fries.

I'm giving them 3 stars.  The saving grace was the sub, which was tasty (okay, it didn't make my toes curl but it was decent). But, unfortunately, the fries were very limp and greasy.  I'm sure I'll have stomach pains later due to the grease consumption.

Next time, I'll try something else (if I ever find myself there again)."}
{"text":"I wanted the all American \"slice and a coke.\" I have been wanting to try Streets of New York and pulled into one for a quick lunch. It was a sit down restaurant and not a regular pizza joint. I requested the bar and the hostess sat me down and explained the menu. She was nice enough.

The waitress was not. Just like the prior review, I felt like I was bothering her. I ordered a combo slice and a coke. She put the plate down and went to take an order from the couple next to me. NO NAPKIN, NO FORK, NO KNIFE! Nothing. She could see that I was looking around but it did not phase her. I grabbed some naps and ate the pizza with my hands which normally is ok. This was a sloppy pizza and wanted the fork to pick up the topping that fell off.

I finished my pizza and coke but was still drinking my water. She proceeded to stack my empty coke glass into my unfinished water glass. I took it off and finished my water. She placed the check on the counter, I paid and NO THANK-YOU!!! WTF!

Will not go there again.

Management of Streets of New York: GIVE YOUR WAIT STAFF PROPER CUSTOMER TRAINING! In this, or any economy, how will you survive with that kind of service. The pizza was OK, but not so much that I will go back with this attitude. On top of it for a slice and a coke it was $8.00 with tip. Their attitude said they do not need my business and I do not need them."}
{"text":"This place has great food and I have gone there probably 6 times since I've moved here 5 weeks ago. With that said the servers have been great. But the owner is never welcoming and for now on I will order my food to go. Maybe I'm  old school but I don't want to be a regular in any place that your not appreciated for being loyal. This place would be great for big sporting games, it would be full of people and now I know why it is not! So I also go across the street to Laticias and they welcome you with open arms. So if you really want some good Italian food I would recommend this place. But I won't bring my family or out of town guest here for a good time. Really sad for pasta and pizza lovers."}
{"text":"We were sick and tired of ordering Pizza from Pizza Hut when friends came over. I've had my fair share of NY pizza so we decided to try Streets Of New York. It had to be better then Pizza Hut! LOL The thin crust pizza was delightful, the flavor of the crust was good and fresh. Impressed with huge selection of unique toppings - toppings you cant get from national chains like roasted garlic and fresh basil. The toppings all had own flavor, not that salty preserved taste. I wasn't puffy from eating it the next day."}
{"text":"We have previously eaten at this Streets of New York in the evenings or on weekends and found the food and service to be good; however, today we went for lunch with a different result. The waiter took the drink order, but did not bring it to the table for another 10 minutes and had the order wrong. Took another 8 minutes to correct the order. Next he took the food order without writing it down and he was uninformed about menu options. He came back to the table twice to get the order correct never actually writing it down. The salads were brought to the table about 13 minutes after his second order clarification. When he brought the pizza slice orders some 15 minutes after ordering, he indicated that the wings were not done yet. Then he came to the table again telling us the wing order got mixed up with a catering order and he had to have them to remake our order. We cancelled them since we had already been there for a long time and were done eating what had already been served. The service was poor and slow except for the gentleman serving the bread baskets who was prompt and kind. There seemed to be major communication challenges from the table to the kitchen. Writing down the order would have helped the situation! Members of our party entered the restaurant at 11:00 am and we finally paid around 12:15."}
{"text":"I ordered boneless wings, a slice a pizza, and a salad. It took them 1 hour and 40 minutes to get delivered. The food was cold and the fat had settled into a jello layer. This was an extremely unpleasant experience. I will never, and i emphasize, never, order from this place again. The manager i spoke to was Carlos, who was rude and unwilling to help. Such a waste of 37 dollars."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars, I would. Walk in to place an order at 8pm. Restaurant completely empty. Order cheese ravioli and a slice of pizza (listed as Extra Large Slice for $3) We are told it will be 10 to 15 mins. We return 10 mins later to be told 'we are out of ravioli.' So my son orders ziti. I ask for my slice of pizza while we wait. Server brings out a box that couldnt be large than 6 inch , 6 inch. I open the box and there is a tiny, dry, over-cooked piece of food that I wont compkiment by calling pizza. Easily this slice came from a 12 inch pie. This slice wouldnt be considered 'extra large' by even the smallest hands. I asked the server... so, this is an extra large slice? She replied, very flippantly, 'yeah, sorry.'  This place is great if you dont want to get what you pay for and if you have no idea what a slice of pizza from NY is like. I have seen better pizza laying on the streets of ny waiting for the street sweeper. Absolutely THE worst."}
{"text":"Sorry to say this place has been better in the past.  It is in need of a really deep cleaning, there is a funky odor of natural gas when you walk in the door.  The gluten free pizza we had was very good, next time I will just order carry out-not eat in.  If you do eat in and order wings, make sure you tell them if you want them to come out BEFORE your pizza, otherwise everything comes out at the same time."}
{"text":"Incompetence at its finest! After the last delivery when they sent the grossest brown celery and carrots I don't know why I went back, this time I ordered a pizza online, paid online, said 20-30 minutes to pick up. So I show up and should have known they were having issues after the gentleman picking up in front of me was given the wrong pizza and they had to remake it, then when they got to me and asked my name I could see the confusion starting, after about 5 minutes the manger came out and informed me they're out of pepperoni and hadn't bothered to call me and let me know they weren't making my order, beware this place!!"}
{"text":"With little options working in a hospital for food, it's wonderful to have such a great place to deliver. The food is great! Service amazing. Our driver brought plates, forks, the works and we forgot to ask. Thank you for providing great food and service! We will order again...and soon!"}
{"text":"Got say not happy i was staying at the holiday inn here and Mesa and was in the mood  for something italian so I thought I would try it here......wrong place. The price was ok the delivery time was ok but the food completely miss the mark! I got lasagna, garlic bread, and minestrone soup. 
The soup had no noodles or beans and was very spice. The garlic bread was the only thing that was kinda ok but still left much to be desired. And when it comes to the lasagna.....idk what it was but it wasn't lasagna I had two bites and through it away worst ever! 
So  with all that said if your looking for good Italian look somewhere else."}
{"text":"I wouldn't come here for NY pizza. It's ok pizza but there's a lot of competition in this area. I haven't had their wings in years. I don't remember being impressed, the standard wings that are fried then have sauce poured on them. Most any place does it this way. 

So why even review this place? two words

BROASTER CHICKEN!!!!!!

Where have you been all my life? It's basically pressure cooker chicken, so it has a fried texture to it, but it's not as greasy as fried chicken. I wouldn't call it healthy, but it certainly could be healthier than fried chicken

It was kinda pricey, I remember paying 8 bucks for a 4 piece (2 white 2 dark) with XL potato wedges, plus two other sides. I had fries, they were parmesan and herb sprinkled, and good. Macaroni salad was fine, nothing special, but I always hope for mac and cheese. The wedges were also excellent, and as I said, three of them were almost an entire half potato.

But the chicken was the star. The outer coating was crispy, not as puffy as KFC or other fried chicken, and somewhat reminiscent of home cooked chicken. The inside had more of that roasted taste with very little if any grease. It's like getting rotisserie chicken with a fried coating.

Just writing this review has me considering going to get some broasted tastiness later today.

Oh ya, service, etc. It was fine. Not slow, but not speedy. Again, no reason for praise or punishment for anything Streets of New York does. But that chicken? Worth it."}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch here for the first time yesterday and found it to be a nice little coffee-shop type of eatery.  He ate the Italian sub sandwich and I had chicken parmesan, which was very good with so much pasta I took home a lot of leftovers.  The seasoned fries that came with the sub were delicious and crisp. Service was excellent.  We would eat here again."}
{"text":"What a great place and service. The food was great. Also DAVE has a big heart and helped sponsor our dart tournament for the Pat Tillman American Legion Post 117 dart tournament. 2 weeks from today. At the dubliner at 40th street and thunderbird"}
{"text":"Maybe we caught them on an off night. The staff was friendly and helpful, but the food was over cooked.  The Caesar salad dressing was good, but the salad was lacking everything except lettuce."}
{"text":"Very below par pizza.  There are several in the valley that kill this place.  Having been to New York several times I can tell you this isn't New York pizza.  Go somewhere else and do yourself a favor."}
{"text":"There isn't a pizza place with a pizza or a crust in Vegas  I've found that has beaten streets. The owner works hard to make sure the restaurant is top quality for most everything. I've love this place."}
{"text":"Great lunch place- I've been to this location a few times for lunch and it's always slow enough to get in and out of but not so slow you are skeeved out to eat there. 

The lunch specials are the right size, the right price and they are fast. If you want to hang out for a while they keep filling up your tea (the best way to get in good with me) or if you gotta run, they hook it up. 

I think most everyone already knows the Streets of NY menu and the food here lives up. Good stuff, consistent, fresh and yummy. 

That is all!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza/pasta place.  They always make my salad just the way I want it, without complaint."}
{"text":"Bought a Groupon for this place. Walked in, we got a look from the waitress was all. Read sign, found out it's a seat yourself atmosphere. Never had broasted chicken before. It was good, but salty. The potato wedges were thick and extra crispy. Pizza and bread was good too. The place was clean. Not busy at all for lunch time on a Sunday. They gave our little kids adult size drinks for $3 each instead of the kids cup at $.75. No personality from the waitress at all which is the only staff member we saw the whole time. May go back."}
{"text":"I am glad to have this place in our neighborhood the food is always great the service is good. The pizza, sandwiches, pasta, chicken and fries never dissapoint. This place is way better than Native."}
{"text":"Paid 26 dollars for terrible customer service and hardly any meat on my three subs. I had to ask for extra and it still wasn't sub worthy. This place is not all that good and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"pizza is a disapointment.  havent been here for about a year.  9 empty tables at 7 pm should explain why.

great service,  sauce is poor, crust is under cooked.  just a blob of cheese and meat . heading back to metro."}
{"text":"Absolutely BEST chicken...ever.  So moist and juicy.  If you like thin crust pizza...this is the best I've had in a very long while.  I will be back sooner than later."}
{"text":"There is nothing New York about this place other than the tacky decor. The food was mediocre at best though we didn't try the pizza. Service was less than stellar. With only 4 tables filled, it took over a half hour to get our food which consisted of a salad, spaghetti w meatballs and a cheese steak.  And once it did arrive it looked like it had sat a bit. It's also over priced, especially for kids. $4.95 for just spaghetti w sauce then extra $.50 for each meatball. You get way better quality food, for less $$ at Humble Pie. It's worth driving the extra distance. At least you know the food is good!"}
{"text":"Best lunch date ever! What a surprise 2 try something new and I found the best place ever!!!!most delicious place especially 4 my birthday countdown Day#1 's!
This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"horrible on so many levels.  super slow to deliver - took an hour and half tonight.  once food arrived it had clearly been sitting for a while.  driver seemed under the influence which likely explains slow delivery.  

we ordered for the gluten free crusts which aren't bad except when cold.  sadly I wish we had picked dominos and that's pretty bad."}
{"text":"I have visited Streets a few times and after the last visit i have come to a conclusion.  The food makes up for the service.  The pizzas, hot sanswiches, apps are all tasty.  The service waitress/hostess(no wait not a hostess, she pointed to the seating area and walked away from us) really brought us down as thats what we talked about until we got our food.  If all u care about is a good pizza, less service, then this place will satisfy you."}
{"text":"Their Antipasto is good but pizza is expensive and tastes like its frozen. Definitely not worth the price.The service is not real friendly either."}
{"text":"Apparently I had a different experience here than Jason L.  But I suppose they had a few months to clean up their act.  

I met up with a few friends, and S of N were having a two for one special on all menu pizzas.  We got two larges, and they were fantastic.  Yes, it was a tad greasy...but its New York pizza and that is how it is suppose to be.   We also got the BBQ wings, which were great. 

My only negative is that it took a bit long.  But, with two-for-one pizza I imagine they were getting pretty slammed in the kitchen.  I will be back, even with the new Native NewYorker down the street opening soon."}
{"text":"Dont bother ordering from these guys, just look at all the poor reviews. Made a delivery order, after waiting hour and half, called only to be told they were busy and that pizza would go out as soon as poissible. Asked to talk to manager and manager does not work weekends. Stay away from this place or you'll regret it."}
{"text":"Its been almost two years since I have eaten at any of the Street's of New York restaurants, and I guess I expected it to be better than it was. And less expensive. 

We wanted pizza for dinner one night but I was tired of all the regular delivery places so we decided to get some Street's. They don't deliver to our area so we picked up. We ordered the pear gorgonzola dinner salad and a medium thin crust margarita pizza. While the salad was good, there were hardly enough toppings to account for the $8 price tag. Maybe 1/8 of a cup of combined cheese, nuts and cranberries, along with four quarters of a pear which were canned on top of maybe half a bag of field greens. This is a tasty salad, and maybe enough for one small person to eat but not enough for any normal person to feel satisfied on. The pizza was also good, but again not worth the $16 it cost. Thin crust, no sauce, tomatoes, basil that I could smell but found no leaves (weird), topped with cheese. My husband could have polished this off on his own if I had let him. It was hardly filling. You think that going thin crust getting less calories should be less expensive as well since the amount of dough used is way less. But I guess I was wrong in that logic. 

I was really disappointed. I used to really love Street's and would order from them all of the time but now its just become too expensive. I have been to many places where I can order way more for the $28 in total (with a small tip) that we spent here. It makes me sad but I probably wont be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"We hit this place while vacationing in Phoenix over the New Years week.

First, the pizza was really good - we had a margharita pizza that was really flavorful.

But it almost doesn't matter because the counter girls gave the impression that you were an annoyance to their conversation.  I showed up to pick up the pizza, and they were chatting away.  The one girl took my card and charged it, while the other girl slid my pizza to me across the counter.  No \"thank you's\", just back to discussion.

I don't need this kind of crap, and would go to another pizza place just to avoid the counter staff."}
{"text":"Streets of New York? More like Gutter Of The Slum. Avoid like the plague unless you like your pasta so overcooked it shreds from your fork. If I could rate a -1 I would."}
{"text":"It's almost insane how good the service is here vs, the Anthem location. Excellent pizza decent prices on draft beer. Unique in how many employees are working at the same time !   Very rare that I would give 5 Stars to a pizza chain."}
{"text":"This place is the best. I am allergic to gluten, and it has been very stressful, because most gluten free pizzas taste like cardboard.  But Streets of New York has the BEST gluten free pizza I have ever had. The staff is friendly as well."}
{"text":"Once they reopened, this place was never the same. They killed the buy 1 get 1 free deal on Wednesday and Sunday as well as the quality of pizza. There lunch pizza was old with some new cheese and toppings thrown on top of old pizza. Northern and 101 location is waayyyy better."}
{"text":"Streets of New York has a few things going for it.. First, great service even on a packed Friday night. Second, great food. My wife and I have been here a few times and each time we are blown away by the quality of the food. Finally, great prices. Two can easily eat and drink for 35 or less."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of broasted chicken and this is the only place that I know of that serves it. It is delicious, always moist and tender. The staff is friendly. I only gave it three stars even though I have been here multiple times because they messed up my last order."}
{"text":"Tried the pizza for the first time today, I was expecting NY style pizza which it was not. Was with some co-workers, one of the girls asked for the soup of the day as mentioned on the menu, they didn't have one, asked for the free passion bread when dinning in, as mentioned on the menu, they didn't have any because the manager wasn't there and the cooks don't listen to the waiters/waitresses we were told. Overall it was ok."}
{"text":"Way overpriced for their product, just drive by and find a much better pie for half the price."}
{"text":"Food was ok but cannoli were a total rip off. One squirt of filling on each side, whole inside was hollow!"}
{"text":"I've been here many time the steaks are always amazing the American waygu the best. The Mac and cheese is my favorite I could eat it all day,  appetizers aren't the greatest and the banana cream pie is to die for. The only thing that bothered me when I got there was the head hostess was snobby and rude and didn't want to take my reservation for a guest who stays there and is a gold member and always spends an easy $600 at your restaurant I felt I should of been taken more seriously other than that the meal made up for her attitude."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place one star because even though it says \"seat yourself\" I waited a good 15 mins and nobody greeted/took my order even though there were two waitresses just walking around talking to each other and the cooks, not to mention there was only ONE other couple there in the whole place. Yeah definitely not gonna spend my money plus a tip on a place with service like that. I ended up leaving and still nobody noticed my party of three."}
{"text":"Hubs & I have ordered from Streets probably more than 20 times since we moved into our house in the summer of 08. So this review is based on delivery only, since we have yet to actually eat inside the place. I can comment on the girl who takes orders though, such a sweetheart! 

Any way, here are a few of our fav items on the menu. For apps we love the potato skins w/extra sour cream or the artichoke spinach dip w/extra bread. My hubby loves their garden salad w/oil & vinegar dressing or if he's really craving salad their greek w/no olives. For entrees my hubby loves their meatball sub on white w/fries, the cheese calzone w/pepperoni, or the chicken parm. I too love the calzones, special baked ziti w/sausage, or garlic pasta substituted w/shrimp. Their desserts are pretty bomb too, the passion cookie or chocolate surprise are both yum, w/extra ice cream of course. 

Oh & they got some new, nifty plastic to go containers, I heart anything I can recycle!"}
{"text":"My name is Matthew and i Ordered 2 cheese pizzas w/extra sauce. Was excited I received an email couponcoupon for a $10 pizza. Went to pick it up on way from work...and after I had a discussion with some of the employees about the coupon and number of pizzas I was  allowed by the manager James to have it honored. The staff before him said I could only have one pizza. So James settles it which was cool of him. Then I get home find out I have 2 pizzas w/o pizza sauce and only cheese. So I guess the lady that took down my order over the phone was confused. Why would anyone want only xtra cheese and  no pizza sauce?So I call James back to let him know what happen and he agreed to credit my ATM card. So least to say dinner was ruined for my kids/family. Now we are off to my son's baseball game starving. I now will wait patiently for my refund to post on my bank account. Oh what fun!"}
{"text":"Last Friday we ordered a thin crust cheese pizza. We live one block from the Glendale location so we picked it up. We actually picked up the pizza about 5 min. early. When we got it home it was almost warm. The crust was tasteless and dry. I would say cardboard, but that does have a flavor. The cheese was dried out. Hardly any sauce. If we weren't so hungry, I would have tossed it in the trash. We need to do some banking in that center today. I will bring the receipt to the store and explain what happened. We will see how they respond. I'll get back to you on that."}
{"text":"My wife and I eat here at least once a month and have always gotten great pizza and service. This location (1959 S Signal Butte Rd. Mesa, AZ 85209) is quite a drive from our home but we gladly pass up the other pizza places along the route to enjoy our favorite pizzas here. Owner is friendly and makes us feel welcome on every visit. Love it!"}
{"text":"I don't really know where to start. I ordered delivery tonight and the online process was fine. My delivery driver was late, which is fine because he was only late by about 15 minutes and I understand that weekends are busy. However, I was called because he couldn't find my apartment but there is only one of my apartment number in the whole complex. They asked if I could open the door and they weren't there...so I'm not sure where they went instead. He eventually found me.
The driver was friendly, but the presentation wasn't great. It was all stuffed into a bag and sideways so the dip I had was all on one side and then the marinara sauce fell out of the bag because it was at the top uncovered, which fell onto my carpet and could've stained it. 
Onto the food. The artichoke dip was awful. I understand there is sour cream in it, but it was so so sour and no balance between that and the cheese and artichoke. I didn't even eat it. The garlic bread was okay. It could've definitely had more garlic and I ordered the cheese bread, and one of the pieces didn't even have cheese on it at all. As for the pasta, it was pretty low quality. The chicken I added to it was good at least. I told them I do not like heavy sauce and if they were worried to put too much they could put it on the side for me. It had a lot of sauce in my opinion, so I'm not sure if they didn't read my request or if that was \"light\" sauce in their opinion. They must drown it then for usual orders. 
One of the delivery boxes was actually ripped too. They could've included utensils an parmesan cheese for the pasta. Nothing I ordered here was better than anything I could make by myself, and I'm not a gourmet chef or anything. Overall just a bad, low quality experience for several reasons. I would much rather go with Rosati's or some other local place I trust. It was worth a try, but definitely not worth the over $30 I spent for it at all."}
{"text":"So my husband an I ordered a Classic  Margherita  Pizza with a Garden Salad, which consist a bag of Ice burg lettuce, couple a hand full of mixed spring lettuce, 1 sliced green pepper, one slice of red pepper, one slice of yellow pepper with 10 huge cucumber chucks 4 tomatoes. when the menu on the internet reads totally different. When I called back to question of the ingredients in the salad. I was told the salad changed. they took away items and charged me more. My Pizza was cold. over cooked and disgusting. we have ordered from there in the past and was never satisfied, but still gave a chance never again will we/ him/nor me order from there again. I find it hard to believe that you would associate the name of this company with New York.  I was born and raised there and this mess you people serve is not representation of anything in New YORK.  I rather drve to Uncle Tonys Pizza, at least he is from NY
GET A LIFE , WORSE PIZZA IN TOWN! .  Also  the food is very  overpriced"}
{"text":"I have seen several cheesy coupons from this place.  These didn't really atract me , they kind of sent me away.  I live right by this place.  I have now for 6 months.  I have looked at it as I drive past but I always think of the coupons.

I had an errand to run during lunch in the shopping center where this place is at.

My friend sugested we eat there.  

Long story short.  

I had 2 slices for lunch that were great.  I dripped the grease and folded it up and ate it like I was on a street in NYC

They gave us garlic knots to much on too that were addictive.

I will go back"}
{"text":"Been going here for years. Good food. Try the soup or any of the salads. Meatballs are excellent too!"}
{"text":"I read some reviews and was a little leary, but tried it anyway. Well I always say there is no such thing as bad pizza, some pizza is just better. There is way better pizza then this place. Don't be fooled with ny in the name, and the price is way to high, $18.84 for a 16\" large pepperoni pizza, are you kidding me!"}
{"text":"Based on all the bad reviews I was very leery of trying this place but hubby wanted broasted chicken so.....here we are.  He was happy with his chicken although cole slaw and macaroni salad leave a lot to be desired.  I ordered a 10\" pizza with tomatoes and mushrooms.  I must have low standards because I liked it and DID NOT think it was overpriced.  To each his own, I guess.  Some people are snobs and some people are low rent.  Service was good and our orders arrived within a reasonable amount of time.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Pizza. Wings. Happy hour. Three things that, alone, bring a smile to the face of millions daily, and when combined, can leave even the most stoic of men in a state of euphoria. 

This is what I experienced my first time at Streets of New York; a scintillating meal, a very tall glass of beer, and a price range that begged me to come back for more. 

The pizza is thin, crispy, and that perfect amount of salt to let you know they're not slacking on the pepperoni. The wings were boneless and while the sauce wasn't as hot as I would like it was tasty---this is a place where I'd ask for sauce on the side instead of tossed, the sauce man is a bit too generous. 

While I was initially disappointed that their happy hour beer was only Bud Light--even though the menu says domestic, insinuating that you have options---their large size is gargantuan and they have sam Adams so things worked out. 

I'm someone who doesn't get caught up on service unless the restaurant is built around such things, but the waitresses seemed a tad apathetic. I never felt ignored seeing as I was the only person dining at the time, but the place held all the enthusiasm of a nursing home on xanax day. 

While this was fantastic for me, seeing as how I enjoy a peaceful dining experience, I know alot of people enjoy a more lively and gregarious experience."}
{"text":"Went here with some coworkers for lunch. Was not impressed with the pizza at all. The garlic bread tasted store bought. Will not return."}
{"text":"This place is questionable at best. My order took over an hour for not even a mile away. My food was barely over room temp at best. And the manager Tony and his staff had an attitude with the fact that they messed up. Even to the point of raising their voice..."}
{"text":"Since moving to Vegas from New Jersey 4 years ago I searched for good Italian and when I found streets of New York I finally found a fantastic pizza and wonderful antipasta salad. I tried to keep giving this restaurant chances with the service but the same grumpy indifferent waitress would ruin our experience. Sad to say I no longer go here because we finally had enough with our last visit. The waitress was so rude and unfriendly I couldn't bare to spend my money somewhere I felt that unwelcome. She greeted our table by asking for a drink order, no hello, no smile, no welcome, nada.. She must be working there for a long time because she's always there unfortunately and makes us feel like cattle, trying to herd us through as quickly as possible. She didn't clear any dirty plates that should have been taken away after our appetizers to make room for our dinners and we had to call her over to the table from  where she was sitting watching the football game to ask for silverware. Every time she would come to the table she would turn away so quickly I had to say excuse me to get her to turn back around so I could ask for something. She made us feel like we were bothering her and that we were just getting in the way of her watching football. I've been a server for over ten years and I would never dream of treating my guests as such. Huge THUMBS DOWN! She takes the hospitality out of the hospitality industry."}
{"text":"Decided to try this location as it is near where my 88 year old mother and 92 year old mother-in-law live. We wanted to take them out for a quick dinner. Well, it was anything but quick. First of all, it was so dark in the restaurant, we couldn't even see the menu. We asked if they could turn up the light above our table which was off. At first we were told no because it is off for the atmosphere. Really? I pulled out a mini flashlight I have on my keychain for everyone to use so we could order. Then they decided to turn on the light. I thought,  this is great, we'll even be able to see our food. As soon as we were done with our menus, they shut the light.

My dad ordered a calzone with peppers, onions and sausage. He also ordered an appetizer of zucchini. My husband ordered pasta as did the rest of us. My husband also ordered a cup of wedding soup. After about 15 minutes, we finally got the attention of our waiter who was just too busy. We asked, where is the appetizer? Where is the cup of soup? He replied it will be right out. How long rise it take to ladle a cup of soup? Another 15 minutes go by, and all of a sudden servers are bringing our meals. We asked for our waiter and again asked where is the appetizer and soup? He finally admitted he thought my dad wanted fried zucchini in his calzone which had just been served to my dad. I immediately sent that back. We explained to the waiter that the whole point of an appetizer is to have something to eat before the meal arrives. He wanted to continue to serve the dinners and bring the zucchini later. We insisted that he take our food back and bring the appetizer first. So he did. Then when he brought our good out it was cold. Not just a little, but barely lukewarm. We asked if they could micro all the plates. Meanwhile my dad is still waiting for  a new calzone to bake. They reheated our food, didn't charge us for the soup or appetizer. 2 hours after we got there, we were finally done. The bread was good, though. Too bad we had to eat 2 baskets of it before we got our food.

I will never go back here again. The food was so so, the service was bad and stupid, and they certainly don't care about making the elderly comfortable. I guess it's not a restaurant for my  people who are 88, 92, and 93."}
{"text":"I love the location, it is very \"little main street\" feeling. The food is good and priced very well. The service is slow, so i would not come here if you are in a rush."}
{"text":"Such good food and kind people. I highly recommend giving them a try...especially the Pizza and Passion Cookie!"}
{"text":"So I frequently order Broaster chicken as take out.  I am always told that it will be 20 minutes.
Never has it been 20 mins. I will tell you more like 40minutes. And inconstancy with the chicken. Once too salty, once too underdone, once overdone. Not impressed! Dont waste your money.  When ordering I usually just get the chicken. They alway serve with a take out of garlic knots. I simply ask the hostess and she said \"NO, you just ordered chicken\"! When I stated we always get them, she just repeated herself.  Terrible customer service."}
{"text":"Horrible service place. Our waitress walked right past us. No word.    We watched as she asked other people what they wanted.  Really.  No silverware. No napkins."}
{"text":"The thin crust pizza is awesome. The service was spectacular! Entire staff was friendly. The waiter was very attentive. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is on the top end of dirty ol pizza joints. I come from Seattle and most of the pizza joints are all gourmet and fancy, which is good, but from time to time it's good to have just dirty ol pizza. This place does it and does it well. It has an extensive menu and cheap beer. I mean cheap GOOD beer. While Blue Moon isn't the bees knees, it's many notches above crizzap like budweiser and such. I got a huge 25 oz glass for $5.50!! That's unheard of in Seattle. That made my day. :)"}
{"text":"We've been going to SONY for probably ten to twelve years,  and i don't think i've had a bad pizza at this place. We get the lunch special sometimes or go there for a full pizza at dinner. I've never tried the sammiches or other pasta, although they look tasty when they pass by our table enroute to some other customer. I like that they all have patios that you can enjoy when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"This location is really is poor! If you enjoy your car being dinged because of narrow parking spaces, please visit this store, happened twice to me and my family.
Very rude staff, always feel they are hung over from the previous night and hate being there and waiting on their customers. I have always loved their pizzas since 1984, but I strongly suggest you visit another location. This one deserves to crash and burn. Bottom line poor management!"}
{"text":"As a lover of Italian food and an even bigger lover of not leaving my house, I decided to give this place a try! As a first impression, I think it went pretty well, and I'm looking forward to my next experience with this place. I ordered the Lasagna and an order of mozzarella sticks. My review:

Menu/Ease of Ordering: 5/5 Used GrubHub and everything went pretty well. They have a pretty large variety of options here also, which is always appreciated.

Delivery: 4/5 I ordered at around 7:40PM and I had an estimated time of 8:40-8:50, which is pretty standard for a delivery place. I received my order at around 8:30PM, so a little ahead of schedule. The food was nice and warm still, which is sometimes hard to do with pasta dishes. The lasagna came in a nice foil container, helping retain the heat, the stix in the standard styrofoam container. My only complaint was that some of the sauce from the lasagna leaked out onto the plastic bag and then the styrofoam from the sticks and the napkins they included. Mildly annoying, but forgivable. 

Lasagna: 4/5 Pretty decent lasagna. I've had better, I've had worse. This lasagna has quite the variety of meats: sausage, beef meatballs, and ham. I've never had ham in lasagna before, but I honestly couldn't taste it in particular in this dish. I'm not a fan of sausage, and it was quite flavorful here. Which, if you're a fan of, I'm sure you'd love. The meatballs tasted nice. Quite cheesy with a decent amount of extra sauce. I don't know if I'd order this again, but it quelled my craving for lasagna.

Mozzarella Sticks: 3/5 Eh, these were just okay. They gave you an ample amount of them, but they just weren't all that great. 7 or 8 sticks and some marinara. They clearly tasted frozen and didn't have too much flavor to them. I will not order these again. 

All in all, a pretty decent experience."}
{"text":"Service was terrible and the restaurant had very few customers. Our chicken wings came out cold so we sent them back. Salad that I ordered was missing some of the ingredients on the menu . Would not return to this location."}
{"text":"My kids wanted pizza for dinner so I googled the closest pizza place near me!!! I called and asked for a Lrg Peperoni pizza and a side of Garlic Bread!!! I went to pick it up and the cashier said $25 dollars???? What??? The pizza tasted just like the pizza at Little Caesars!!! Could of gotten 5 lg pizzas there!!! Not going back there for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"In the past I have had great service, and great delivery. But Weds, we ordered a 100 dollar order delivered, and only half of it was delivered which took almost 2 hours. And half of what was delivered was wrong. 2 pastas were specifically told to not include onions because of sever allergies. Well, the 1 pasta that was delivered had onions. 
Over half of our party  could not eat due to not being delivered or not being able to eat what was delivered.  Javier as a manger was difficult to get hold of. it took 3 days to get in contact with him, and no other person was willing to help me. Javier seems to be the only driver. Now I can not figure out why a store manager would be their only driver. Hopefully they figure out a better way to run their restaurant."}
{"text":"So I have been here once prior to this last visit and I remember not being impressed by the service but the pizza was okay, not great but okay, and it is in close proximity to me so that is a draw. We went back the other night, mainly again because it was close and we had a coupon for two for one. Even with a coupon I don't think I would go back. I had baked ziti. It was rather bland and there wasn't anything special about it, not bad, but not good either. I switched with my dining partner who had the eggplant rollitini, this was horrible, the underlying bed of spaghetti was fine. It tasted like the make their own sauce, but the eggplant was mushy and again bland. Definitely not recently cooked, more like microwaved, and possibly bought from Sysco instead of being made in house. It was a $2.50 or so up charge for a dinner salad and bread sticks. The bread was hard and cold. The dinner salads were okay. One biggie though - no fresh brewed iced tea. Service started out slow but once the waitress came over everything was fast. I was teetering before a one star, as I said I will never go back there, but gave them a two as the sauce on the spaghetti was decent and the service was good when we finally got service. If there were halfsies in yelp I would probably do one and a half. Although I will note if I didn't have the coupon I would have definitely felt that it was not worth $30+ for two people."}
{"text":"Yuck, yuck yuck. I've been wanting chicken fingers all day. I finally placed my order & not only were the fried soggy the chicken fingers looked yuck & were tasteless. I also asked for hot sauce, guess what I got instead?? Cherry sauce. Like wtf am I going to do with cherry sauce?? I can't do this place & will never recommend it to anyone. Save ur money. $19 wasted on this place."}
{"text":"Being a native New Yorker I like to think I recognize good pizza. This place has good pizza. Salads are fresh. Meatball hero ( called \"subs\" out here) are excellent. The bread they use is like back East, real Italian bread. Crusty on the outside, not mushy. Delicious. Exceptionally good service at today's visit. Thank you, Robert."}
{"text":"This review is only in reference to the Broaster's Chicken.  Amazing chicken, however, not much flavor.   Dip in some honey, ketchup or BBQ sauce and it goes from decent to awesome.  You can also mix with your favorite wing sauce and create absolute amazingness! Wish they had a couple more sides to choose from.  The potato wedges that come with the chicken are also great."}
{"text":"We ordered while staying at the Squaw Peak Hilton. Fortunately, everything we ordered came and was good. The receptionist was friendly and accommodating. However, we didn't receive any plates, napkins, or forks. I asked numerous times to make sure they were included. Our driver also got lost and had no idea we were at a hotel. I also think for the price it wasn't a great value. I don't think this is a bad establishment it just think they didn't have it together today."}
{"text":"Terrible service. I called in an order 30 minutes before I needed it. I had a coupon but it was for dine in only. No big deal right. I get there and there is no record of my order and the shift just changed. OK well since you lost my order and I have to wait another 30 minutes, can I use my coupon? Nope! They just shrugged and said sorry. Well if you are really sorry you would do something! And this was the manager. No wonder the place was empty."}
{"text":"Tried Streets of NY for the first time.  We had the New York Combo Pizza and wings.    The staff was great!  I felt like family by the end of the meal. It was a great lunch experience.  Traci greeted us warmly when we walked in.  The bread while waiting for Pizza was the perfect appetizer. As busy as the restaurant was - the manager, Caroline still found time to come out introduce herself and ask us how our first time experience was.  The food was great and I know we will be returning in the near future. The 10\" pizza was perfect for two people and the wings were outstanding!"}

{"text":"The pizza was not good at all.  When a place says New York on it you except to have New York pizza.  It was very pricey and I'm glad my husband wasn't home to taste it.  He's from Brooklyn New York and he would of had a heartache after he tasted it.  Find another place to go and save your money.  It sucked.  I live in Vegas again.

{"text":"Used to be a good place. Has gone downhill the last few years. I already know their pizza is not good anymore, it was when they first opened, but I was in the mood for pasta and decided to give them a chance to redeem themselves . 

I ordered to go and when I got their at 8 pm on a Saturday night and there was only one two person table and no other people in the restaurant, I had a feeling something wasn't right. 
Spent $23.17 on two pastas to go. One the was spaghetti with meat sauce, I would compare it to a can of Chef Boyardee. The other was a pesto pasta with chicken, not very good either. 

Threw them both in the trash

After this meal, I also threw my Streets of New York takeout menu in the trash"}
{"text":"Zero stars should really be an option. I have been eating here for over 15 yrs and today we went in with my 4 yr old son. He was hungry and we asked if they sold pizza by the slice, they said yes and told us to take a seat and someone would be over to take our order. Five minutes went by and my husband went to ask for the bathroom key, he returned from the bathroom and we waited for more minutes. After being told to take a seat you think they would know we were there. An associate and what we can only guess was the manager on duty made eye contact with us and never came over. After 15 yrs I cannot support this kind of company. I won't be returning. We left, with a hungry child and went elsewhere."}
{"text":"I got a bowl of Alfredo today for lunch with penne pasta, it was by far the best Alfredo I have ever had. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent! But it was the service that made the experience much more satisfying. Our waitress Ashley was attentive, kind, and extremely helpful.  My son forgot his retainers in a napkin, and we didn't realize until we got home. I frantically called and asked if we could go through the trash, but Ashley had already gone through it and found them by the time we got there. Way over and above her job description. Amazing woman! Thank you."}
{"text":"Update.   Husband spoke to actual manager today and she took care of us.  She is a great example of good customer service.  Because of that we will definitely continue to choose this restaurant as the food is delicious."}
{"text":"I only gave 1 star because I couldn't give 0. I placed an online order at 5pm tonight and the order said it would be delivered by 6pm.  I called at 615 and 640 to find out where it was and was told it would be there soon.  I asked if it would be cold since it had taken so long but was told they have 'magic bags' that keep the food hot.  Finally delivered at 645, guy told me he's the only one delivering.  The magic bags don't work, shocking! My onion rings and calzone were soggy and cold and inedible... Disgusting... 
Will not order from this location again, who wants disgusting food? The calzone wasn't even closed all the way on top because it was so greasy... Oh wait but it's ok, because their first thought is to offer me a credit for my next order? No thank you, there will not be a 'next order'. 
I like food I can actually eat, and maybe even enjoy!"}
{"text":"This was my first time in here and right away we got a warm welcome. We sat down and were greeted by Alexis and she got our drink quickly. Our food was wonderful. It was the best service I've had in awhile Alexis was friendly and funny and didn't seem too busy for us while still being able to take of everyone else as well. Never did we have to wait on anything. This will not be my last time coming in here. I loved the environment. I will be back."}
{"text":"First time eating here and was pleased with the wings but not the pizza. The whole middle was so thing and uncooked there was nothing to the pizza. Sad because I probably won't go back now."}
{"text":"I had heard such great things about this place, but neither my husband or I left happy. The service was pretty bad despite the place being practically empty. The real issue was the food. Disgusting. My husband had a sub and it was fine. Nothing special, but fine. I got the ravioli and it was freezing cold and disgusting. I wasn't expecting some fine Italian food, but I expected far more than six measly frozen ravioli pieces in canned sauce. I mean seriously, charging ten dollars for that absolutely disgusting crap is just robbery. Not coming back. :/"}
{"text":"The only reason why four stars and not five because we didn't try the pizza yet.

The items we did try were; garlic bread knots, minestrone soup, cheese ravioli in alfredo sauce, spaghetti and meatballs, and cheese cake.
All was fabulous and the service was very good too!"}
{"text":"Not normally a pizza guy but I was feeling like cheese and bread so I headed to the closest place on Yelp. I read the bad reviews but I just didn't feel like driving. The place was pretty slow so maybe that's why I got great service. I enjoyed myself, the food was good for what it is and the service was prompt."}
{"text":"Yelp menu is old, prices have increased on dinner by 25%, quality has decreased 50%. Portion size of lasagna was petite, salad OK, price on soup resembles printer ink. Tasty, but 6$!!!!! At least other restaurant that charge 26$ for dinner w soup & salad would drop the delivery charge."}
{"text":"Great pizza for take out. The dinners in the restaurant are also good. Bar service was good. They offer military discount of 15%, I thank you and will be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited this location (one of the few in the SW valley) to munch on some pizza and wings and watch the football game. It was our first visit.

The interior was cozy and clean and smelled great. There were 5 TVs in various locations for a good view. We were seated immediately. Our friendly server was quickly upon us and our pitcher of Fat Tire was soon to follow along with 2 frosted glasses. Nice touch.

We were given a basket of garlic breadsticks while we waited. An unexpected surprise. We got the 16 inch pepperoni pie which arrived piping hot. I know pizza is a very personal thing to many so you can't please everyone. But we liked it. The traditional crust wasn't too thin or thick. Just right. A bit chewy but not offensively so. The sauce was good and rich. I would have preferred a little more cheese but thats me.

The wings were outstanding. We're from Buffalo and are picky about our wings. I got traditional medium and my better half got BBQ. We thought we'd try baked. (They offer fried or baked) But were careful to specify \"well done\". You want your wings crispy not soggy. They came out just right. The BBQ wings were cooked after coating so the sauce crisped up nice. And get this... They offer blue cheese dressing for dipping! Unheard of down here.

Overall a good time was had by all. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I placed an order to go and was given an expected time to pick it up. I showed up 5 min earlier than that time however it looked like my pizza had been done for quite some time. The pizza was somewhat warm, not hot like a fresh pizza is."}
{"text":"First time eating here and I ordered through delivery . Figures it has decent reviews and looked yummy I got a Greek salad and the pasta pesto after emptying one of my dressing containers I noticed a black hair in the bottom very gross I couldn't finish my food what a waste of $30 ."}
{"text":"Food is really good but the service we got from our server tonight was awful we needed refills and had dirty plates on the table. At first we thought she was just slow because she's pregnant but it was because she was more interested in her cell phone."}
{"text":"This is my first and last visit to this location. Our waitress was nonexistent, our food took a really long time and was cold when it got to the table. The order was completely wrong. We figured our waitress was probably new or was having a rough day so we gave her the benefit of the doubt. She said she would fix it and we again waited another 45 minutes. We found that our waitress had disappeared. By this time, we were done.
We kept asking other wait staff for our waitress and we had to get up and ask for napkins, utensils and our drinks.  The other waitress that helped us was incredibly sweet and apologetic but the damage was done.
I can't even tell you if the food was good because we never got to eat... We picked it up at the front and it sat in the car while we went shopping.
While we were paying our bill we noticed that we were charged for the wrong order, it was never corrected.
I hope that everything is okay with our waitress but at this point, we can't imagine putting ourselves through that again."}
{"text":"UPDATEEE- manager contacted me and made it right !!!! Pizza was amazingggggggggggggggggggggggg def will try again!!!!!!!!!


Worst experience ever!!!!! And I'm from the east coast!!! I would never treat anyone how the 2 people the young lady and guy working treated me . I wanted to like this place sooo bad I walk in I got totally ignored! Not only did the hostess young lady ignore me she didn't even say hello welcome to such and such nor did the other guy . Did ask if I had any questions she found tons of stuff to do while I  waited for just her to notice me . Extremely rude I'm the kind of person that when I find a good east coast place I tell my east coast friends but that will never happen extremely rude and I WILL NEVER RETURN and tell everyone to not go to your establishment !!!! Find better staff that don't mind being social."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza on-line and it was delivered promptly and it was great. Well worth the money. I called and talked to the owner to tell him \"Thanks\" and he was very nice."}
{"text":"Sandwiches were pretty good and the chicken was great but the  pizza dough was horrible. To soggy. Definitely not New York style pizza."}
{"text":"We are new to the area and wanted a pizza delivery to quench our hunger after a long move. We found this restaurant on Yelp and we were not disappointed. Its a little more than we are accustomed to but the Vegetable pizza was absolutely incredible."}
{"text":"Good pizza, fresh garlic knots, good lunch specials, and nice servers. This is what I get every time I come here. 

The patio is nice although I would love to see some better seats and tables.  The restaurant is always clean and inviting. 

Only oddity is when I ordered the Cesar salad it came with tomatoes and red onion slices on it. I order a Cesar salad for a reason that is all I'm saying. 

I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. Took a pizza home. Was delicious. My daughter loves the bread sticks."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and had Greek salad (not lunch special) as told lunch special was size of dinner side salad,  the one I got was a little bigger than dinner side salad. but had diced tomatoes, olives and cucumber,  chopped  romaine lettuce and only, 1 slice of onion.  Pretty pathetic considering they pictured it as a featured lunch special on a nice plate with sliced of cucumber and tomato wedges to say the Kat. I had to pay  the dinner  price to get half of what was pictured for lunch. 
No wonder this place was empty."}
{"text":"Overpriced and not the best quality. Thin crust pizza like cardboard. Need to make post longer so it can be posted"}
{"text":"I dont leave a complaint unless there are multiple problems. I now have 3 complaints about this place, all in under 2 months.

The first problem was a bit of racism towards people of color. My wife and i have been in for a pick up order a couple of different times. My wife brings my bank card in and she has no problems paying for the order with my card, and vice versa. However, we sent my cousin in (with my card) who also happens to have a skin tone and a look that resembles a mexican american, to pick up my order the employee required identification to match the name on the card. My cousin returned to my house and i went back to pick up my order... the same employee took my card and ran payment without requiring identification. Yes, my wife and i are white... and have yet to be carded for any purchases in this location, including alcohol purchases.

The second problem. Placed an order for pick up. Ordered thin crust. Got home to find the pizza was cut into triangles. YOU DONT CUT THIN CRUST INTO TRIANGLES, you cut it into squares. The pizza will limp over like a wet noodle if cut into triangles. Also, it was almost fully dry, like no sauce at all.

The third problem. Placed an order for delivery at 7:30pm. At 9pm, no pizza. i call in to ask where my pizza is at and the staff dont have any info on me and cant find my order. While im on hold, i check my bank account and i was already charged the $40 for my order. They finally find my order and said the pizza went out on delivery 20 minutes ago. I wait until 9:30pm until my pizza finally arrives. I inspect the pizza first, its cold and looks like it has been sitting on a counter for over an hour. I refuse the pizza from the driver and call in to get a refund. Employee on the phone was less than apologetic.

Needless to say, im scratching this place off my list. Who ever manages this place needs to be fired. Who ever owns it needs to sell the business to someone who wants to provide actual customer service and actual restaurant skills."}
{"text":"The cheese pizza is so good here. I really want to try other options but always end up getting the cheese pizza. Fried Chicken is great also. Really crispy skin. Staff is friendly. Text STREETS30 to 86677 to get specials via text msg."}
{"text":"What is up with the rave over this pizza? I had one yesterday and it was mediocre at best. The crust was like the cardboard box it came in, the toppings were virtually non existent (may have been a quarter of an onion cut over a large pizza), about 3 tablespoons of sauce, and way undercooked. Of course, I am spoiled when it comes to pizza - I am just in from Chicago and this was my first pizza in Arizona."}
{"text":"Pizza is great! Had the philly cheese steak pizza with traditional crust. Family loved the fried chicken. Service was great. Definitely will come again!"}
{"text":"I was hungry for pizza and decided to stop at this little pizza place, since I was in the area. The menu is extensive, and of course, since I wanted to get a pizza to go, I didn't get a chance to try any of the menu items.  However my waitress went over several of the items with me, and she was very pleasant and easy going.  I wanted the pizza in a box, but also wanted to have a slice at the restaurant, since I was starving, and she readily agreed.

The pizza comes in thin crust and \"traditional\" - and the crust was baked just right.  The topping were skimpy, and the sauce was bland, to my taste.  But overall, a good pizza."}
{"text":"Service here was fine, ordered for pick up got to try a little of everything the pizza,pasta,fries,wings, & chocolate cake. the food was just not good as simple as that,for the price of there food I was expecting a lot more & this was just way below average. Would not recommend wasting your money here."}
{"text":"Got us right to a table but the service was awful and they ran out of complementary breadsticks? We ordered 3 large pizzas and I assume you make you're breadsticks from pizza dough. Pizza took forever even if it did taste good. Not good as Ny but ok. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Stopped here for some Italian food and we were hesitant but hopeful. What a sweet surprise!! Service was great and the food was wonderful!  Asked for a well done pizza and it was perfectly prepared my husband had Lasagna and it was just as good as my meal. A must repeat for us."}
{"text":"Horrible service /experience.  Went to pick up my takeout order and some bozo had a nasty out of control dog that tried to bark and attack me.. needless to say I barked back and scared the shit out of that dog. Equally bizarre and disturbing, I witnessed the server repeatedly keep petting the dog. Food service employee petting dogs and serving you wine and pizza?? Ummm Disgusting... my advice,  choose a different pizza restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband's grandfather has a very set routine. He goes to Streets of New York every Thursday for lunch without exception. So during our weeklong stay with him over the Christmas holiday, we got the chance to tag along (and then loved it so much we decided to go back again on Friday!)

The service was excellent and food consistently good. One of the best cobb salads I've ever had and the wings were delicious.

As I've never been to any of the other locations I can't vouch for this one being any better than the rest, but I will say it was really great in its own right."}
{"text":"I love this little pizza place and I've never had a bad meal.  I usually get take-out and the pizza is at my place usually within 30-40 minutes even though they say 45.  

I'm very, very picky about tomato sauce and marinara sauce in that I don't like them at most pizza places (especially the marinara).  But here, however, the tomato sauce is excellent.  The crust isn't doughy and the cheese and toppings taste fresh.  I've had their caesar salad, also, and have never been disappointed.  I usually order the formaggio pizza, and it's my absolute favorite.  It's not on the menu anymore, but they will still make it.  

I know people like to compare pizzas (to New York ones, for instance), but really people should judge the pizza on its own merit, regardless of the name of the place.  I don't know whether this pizza is like a NY pizza or not...some say it isn't, and it's always New Yorkers who complain about out-of-state pizza (sorry New Yorkers, it's true!)    

I don't understand some of these reviews.  When I've gone in to pick up a pizza, have one delivered, or dined in, the staff has been nothing but friendly and I've had nothing but good service.  I took a friend from out of town there and she loved it, too.  

They always seem busy, especially on weekends, but fairly steady during the week as well when I've stopped in.  That's a good sign.  This is the only place I order pizza from now."}
{"text":"1st, they were out of what I ordered. On a Friday. At lunch time. Next, they didn't do anything to make it better. They just switched my ravioli for plain pasta and charged me the same amount, even though plain pasta is almost 4 dollars cheaper, they still charged me the ravioli price. When my updated order got to me, they put the wrong sauce on my pasta too. The delivery itself was great, really fast and the guy was nice. Hence the two stars."}
{"text":"Quoted 40 minutes for delivery of food. Gave them one hour before calling to check on the status. They replied \"on its way\". Fine. Waited another 15 minutes and called again. Same answer. Needless to say, food arrived 90 minutes after ordering and of course it was ice cold. Instead of calling to complain, figured the best way to handle situation is to let them have the $30 and make sure they never get another penny from me. Too many quality restaurants out there that appreciate the business."}
{"text":"6/14/14 3 stars for the Pizza because it's the only place that offers artichokes as a topping. The appetizer was not so impressive, we got seated near the kitchen we got stuck listening to the waitresses and one of the cooks discuss rides at Disneyland and the pleasure of listening to Mexican polka music compete with the dining room music. I have been a shift manager at a food establishment..music coming from the kitchen is a big no no. Just make sure to get seated somewhere other than next to the kitchen."}
{"text":"I wrote a review about 6 months ago and wasn't happy with the food. I just went back to give it another try since it's so close to home and WOW I must of been there on a bad night before because the food was great! They must of made some changes or something. I be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty decent. It is definitely worth it to try any of the pastas. I had their pizza recently and was probably one of the better pizzas I've had in town. A little pricy though. The service is what brings the rating down for me. Sometimes the servers will mistaken something you said and mess up your meal. It doesn't happen very often but I would be careful. The place is dead in the early evenings so it's nice and quiet. It is one of the better Italian restaurants in town so it's definitely worth trying out."}
{"text":"Never disappoints! Great food, fun atmosphere and wonderful service. Each time we have eaten at this particular site we have had the same server. He is always calm, polite, social, and very good at what he does. The food is always wonderfully prepared! Just so you know, you can order lunch sizes at dinner, which is always nice for people with smaller appetites. We were not aware of that until our last visit, so this is good to know. If you are ever at this location hope that Jason is your server."}
{"text":"Great cracker crust! Nice large salads...great to split! Karla is wonderful, great service! Nice date night location...for mom & son!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a pizza that's not from little ceasars or dominoes, this is a good alternative. Only wine and beer. Not a full bar. The Greek chopped salad was not chopped but still good. The calzone was good but had a lot of sauce. Seems to be really great for families. The staff is awesome. Very friendly."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time. Ordered the ultimate cheese steak. Delicious! I got it delivered. Only complaint is it was quite soggy. Whatever sauce on it that made it this way should be served on the side especially for delivery. I'd definitely eat here again though. One of the stars for the fact they brought napkins forks and condiments . Rare nowadays without requesting it."}
{"text":"Very unimpressed. Salad was stale and drenched with dressing, wings were gross. Not going back."}
{"text":"The only reason for 3 stars, our server Erin was great. If they want to use a name like streets of New York, they should come to New York and see how real Pizza is made. I could suggest a few places they could take lessons from."}
{"text":"I took a client yesterday here. We ordered two salads, 1 med pizza meatball and onion. I was stunned it was amazing, I meaning simply outstanding.

 I don't always eat pizza but when I do it will be here!!

Great job guys!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The Pizza is the best I have had anywhere in the Phoenix Metro area and certainly the best I've had in Mesa/Chandler.  Price is reasonable for the food quality and authenticity.  They always seem to have a special everyday.  I highly recommend this pizza restaurant..."}
{"text":"We came to your restaurant tonight and was treated the worst ever. Very rude staff. Trying to be sat at a table not a booth and they were upset we didn't want a booth. Employee's were arguing on where to seat us.Then a lady came out and told us they couldnt seat us at all in the whole restaurant due to a big party that was coming in. Nobody should be treated that poorly by every single employee. Shame on you guys!! Will never return back!!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in years. Came for a quick bite. Had the Minestrone it was the BEST I've ever had. Got a free cannoli. It was so good. I'll be back"}
{"text":"Once in a lifetime.
You don't ever see me giving 5 stars. If I have to deduct a star, it would only be because it is over 25 miles from my cave.
I've seen the other reviews, and I do concur with a few of the statements:
Yes, the pizza doesn't remind me of any pie back east, especially New York. But I tell you this: They should call it the Streets of Phoenix. Being the official pizza of the Phoenix Suns, it only makes sense. It's the best pizza on the west coast, especially better than that California Kitchen place.
Some people don't like the service, some do. At this point of the game, this is the most consistent. Of course, I could be distracted by the important games, but that's just another service they offer me and i DON'T EVEN HAVE TO ASK. 
I come to eat, hang out, and watch sports, and no one has ever bothered me and there wasn't an occasion where I had to depart from my R/R status.
Where does the 5 stars come in? I'm getting to it.
After work, I come for a light meal. Turkey has always been my favorite sandwich. Even though they have my favorite turkey sandwich, I, now, can't make up my mind about the chicken pesto sandwich or their tuna. They are that good.
The wedding soup and the tortilla are necessities with my sammies, unless I am in a mood for a salad. In that case, I encounter another fork in the road between the pear-gorgonzola, chicken caesar or  antipasto. 
The chicken wings they serve, is their own. I don't know what they do to them but it's close to genius in my books. I can replicate anything at Metro. But this place has the goods, they put love back in the kitchen.
So, easy 4 stars right there. The fifth star is for getting me to eat soup or salad, and liking it. For me, losing 30+ lbs after eating their 3 nights a week is the money maker.It has never been so easy and I didn't even have to try. With their menu, I could rule this planet.
I can't wait to make it to their new store on Ft. Apache and Tropicana."}
{"text":"Like the mighty USS Essex LHD-2, 2 on the hull but second to none. The 2nd store of its kind to serve the valley and the residents of Spring Valley now has gold in them hills. 
I came in to get my chicken wing fix because they closed the Hooters at Sunset station, and at risk of confusing you, the naked wings brushed with the honey hot sauce is only rivaled by B-dub's mango habañero and more manageable for the mild pallets out there. 
The fresh passion bread tossed in their garlicky butter and Parmesan cheese is the best rendition in the valley. 
I also had a slice of pizza with mushrooms but there is something else besides mushrooms and it the zing I experienced makes me think that what they have is better than any New York style.
The service is top notch. I saw 4 people grace my table of one as I enjoyed some NBA action. Loud enough to here commentating but not so much as to have to yell over surrounding clatter. 
For now, 5 stars until I revisit to try the rest of the menu. Since the stuff I had was surprisingly original and not like the hole-in-the-walls who serve the same bowling alley grease troughs.
Lastly, Jared, my server, made me feel right at home. Well, not really- I don't have servers at home, but welcomed I was. And between 3rd and 4th quarter, I saw the delivery driver in and out a couple of times. He must be really fast. Nowadays, when I call any of those other places they tell me an hour and they fill it pretty well. I kinda wished I lived nearby, because Alec or Alex seemed very professional and friendly, too."}
{"text":"The food here is great. We always call and order to go and the phone staff is usually prompt and polite with minor hiccups. This is definitely one of my families favorite places to get pizza from."}
{"text":"Visited streets again with friends.. their choice. :) Streets did much better. Prompt service, food was correct and cooked properly. Everything went well and the food was good."}
{"text":"Been there twice, wait staff is nice and \"real\" ( I love a place that has people working who have tattoos).  But that's not the point.  Food was quick, fresh and delicious!  The price was awesome for what we got on a Tuesday before 6pm, a 16oz bud lite, cheese garlic bread, and two big slices of pizza with add. toppings fed the both of us happily.  Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and salads that are fairly priced  We really enjoyed it.  Service was prompt and friendly. Great location and you can dine outside, if you choose. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just got put on hold for seven minutes before being hung up on while trying to place an order. We'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love the place because its close to home and the food is delicious. I love the Italian sausage appetizer with fresh marinara and melted mozzarella... Yum! The spinach and artichoke dip is made with fresh artichokes, fresh Parmesan cheese and sautéed spinach served with flat bread. Delicious!  The staff is super friendly and I am a big fan of local businesses. They have patio seating which is a bonus and great seating options throughout. I like to belly up to the bar, which is small but adequate as this isn't a watering hole! Cheers"}
{"text":"Great home style pizzas & wings. I recommend skipping the corporate pizza giants & trying this place for great Italian comfort. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"It got 4 stars but you have to know exactly what to get--and that is the #7 \"Best of Everything\" sandwich. Literally this is the only thing you should get here--everything else is pretty average, surprisingly."}
{"text":"The pizza was good but the wait time for pick up was far too long since we had called it in WAY ahead of time. We even hit Wal Mart before going to pick it up and we still had to wait for our pizza..."}
{"text":"We ordered wings, boneless, Buffalo. Just a little bit before happy hour ended. We decided not to get pizza and do pasta and a sub.  We got our \"wings\" which were black, round little crispy balls of dry chicken with Italian dressing g with some hotsauce mixed in drizzled on top. I couldn't chew them so I sent them back. When we got our new wings they looked a million times better. They were golden and smothered in some of the same weird sauce. These were still partially frozen. I didn't bother sending them back for fear they'd spit in my raviolis. My boyfriend ordered a Philly I ordered raviolis.  His sandwich was sub par. He said it was just some beef, melted processed provolone cheese on a dry sesame bun. Bummer, then my raviolis were big and round, the filling was nearly flavorless, obviously frozen and processed swimming in some sauce that was as tick as ketchup with a taste to match. We waited a long time between refilled and when they asked how my food was I told them it was gross. She left it at the table and brought the check about ten minutes later. With the wings and ravioli included! We wont be going back...to any of this chain and I dont recommend it. If you want a NY slice and some yummy wings go to pats pizza plus. Its a dive half the price and twice as good."}
{"text":"$25 for a pizza. and it's really not all that great. 

The owner chimed in, so after further thought, I upgraded Streets of NY because their food is good, just not my fav, and in MY OPINION, over priced.

I did keep noticing some pretty bland sauces in the calzones, so I quit ordering them.. and then I noticed the same thing on the pizza. Kinda waters it down, for lack of a better term. If you take issue with some sauces, the only pizza I would recommend is their Pesto, which I have had, and it is delicious. 

It looks like on paper they have a good lunch menu, which I have not tried. I'm more apt to get a sub for lunch than do a sit down, which the average bill goes from $8 to $15-$20 with tip. and last time I ate there, which was last week for dinner with a buddy, I was annoyed that while I was eating the server asked me if I wanted a beer after I already ordered coke. This was after I had already been served and was drinking it. I just felt like it was kinda tacky, maybe even pushy. You see, I had a DUI last year and i'm more sensitive to drinking and driving these days. I drove that night and did not want to drink alcohol, hence ordering the coke. So, why would a server be asking me if \"i want a beer or something??\" To boost the bill maybe? Yeah, I think so for sure. 

As far as the pizza, I'm not here to advertise another restaurant, I just know that there are better deals on pizza. For that kind of money, I'd rather just get something from the grocery store and cook it at home OR get a Happy Hour Deal at a restaurant in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery to our hotel. Food was wonderful. Great sandwich and parm fries. Driver was a nice lady. Quality, fam."}
{"text":"Absolutely flavorless 1/2 pepperoni, 1/2 cheese pizza.  The sauce is tasteless.  Also ordered bruschetta that wasn't good.  The garlic bread was dry and tasted stale with little flavor.  The tomatoes were boring.  Mind you, I like bland food.  Can't believe I spent $30+ for this.  Never again!"}
{"text":"We ordered 4 sandwiches, Meatball, Chicken Parmasean and 2 of the pesto chicken hoagies.  The sandwiches were delivered, they were supposed to be hot, but were luke warm at best when they arrived, very bland, no flavor, and to make things worse we paid $45 for the 4 sandwiches to be delivered, but that isn't the worst part!!!  The next morning my son was violently ill, puking all over the place, and I will spare you the details of everything else, but he had food poisoning.  I called Streets of New York to tell them about it, and was met with a rude manager that questioned me to death, and didn't think that it was their food that made my son sick! Maybe if I didn't work as a chef, then I may have had it wrong, but I told the manager that I worked with food on a daily basis, and she still seemed to think that either I was making it up, or I was jsut wrong. Very, very , very disappointed, will never order thru them again, and I would advise that you check your food if you order with them, make sure you don't get sick too!"}
{"text":"Broasted chicken was excellent.  In the past I have had pizza and cheesesteak subs....also both excellent.  I left off a star only because I keep an eye on the chair before I sit down.  They tend to clean the tables well but don't pay attention to what spills onto the seat.......but only sometimes."}
{"text":"With area options like Spinatos and Stumpys, the only reason to get pizza from this over-priced vendor is that they are open on Sunday until 9pm. You wont hate the food, but the value is lacking."}
{"text":"i have been looking for a new york style pie since i relocated to scottsdale a few months ago. ordered a large cheese pie thin crust and a large new york style crust.
just terrible is all i can say. no taste no flavor a basic chain style pie with no soul.

never again."}
{"text":"We came for Sunday lunch. No one here but thats fine with us. Service was great. Ordered pizza and 8pc chicken combo. 4 of us enjoyed and had leftovers for the week. Food is amazing. Best chicken ever. Kfc who?"}
{"text":"Live in vegas and love the streets of New York on Durango. Came to Arizona for a football game and my buddy told me they ave one close by so I was happy. Walked in and greeted and sat by our waitress RJ. She was awesome. She was fun and full of smiles. She said she's a cardinals fan we are not so she gave us a hard time for being 49ers fans but still wished us a good time at the game later that weekend. Her personality defiantly makes the place what it is. Food was great just like the one back home. Next time we come to town for a game we will make sure to stop by and say hello and have a few beers and a bite to eat !"}
{"text":"I go here almost every week for lunch. Their lunch specials are really cheap and the service has always been exceptional.  Mary is awesome!  I recommend trying some of their specialty sandwiches."}
{"text":"Placed a order for delivery tonight, I had guest over. I ordered the specialty chicken pizza with the breaded chicken, order of street fries, passion bread, and ordered twenty four honey hot wings. All the food was cold- I live on the same street blocks away. The chicken on the pizza was very dry, passion bread was hard/cold. The Street fries were the worst, rubbery and stale. The twenty four wings I ordered, only came with 11 wings in the box. I was charged for twelve. My order came up to $50.61 and I tipped the driver $5.00
I was fine with dominoes, but my guest wanted something of better quality. As hungry as we were, Now the food still sits cold on my kitchen counter- minus the eleven wings for my refund in the morning."}
{"text":"Ordered for the first time today. Food was great! I asked for a sandwich without an ingredient, they made it correctly. The fries were amazing, crispy and delicious. The delivery took longer than  promised but I would definitely order again. Good job guys!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great pizza and great service. It's like the perfect storm."}
{"text":"I like their dough-the least \"chainy\" tasting chain in AZ. Pricey by comparison to other places I go, and delivery is always slow. You insist on extra cheese though, and they make it so you can't barely hold up the box. Good sandwiches too, particularly the pastrami. Pastas not as good but hey, can't hit everything out of the park."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. Chopped antipasto salad and a simple pizza. Asked for plates/utensils. Food arrived in time promised. No plates/forks. Hmmm. Food was fine but eating was adventure."}
{"text":"Worst customer service, I walk in and no one greeted me I sat myself as the sign said. Waited for almost 10 minutes and no one approached the table while 2 employees are sitting at the bar and watching tv. Then I sit at the bar and felt completely invisible. I walked out and nothing was said to me. Simply disrespectful staff."}
{"text":"Just can't say enough about what amazing service we receive at this Streets Of New York location.  The food is always amazing!  Best thin crust pizza in the valley ... hands down.  Salads are delicious and the chicken is always juicy and tasty!!  Great food is why we come, but the service is just incredible.  Caroline the General Manager is running a top notch place, and clearly sets the example for her team ... and blows it out of the water with an amazing experience EVERYTIME!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible! It wasn't even busy and it took the waitress 15 minutes to come to our table when we arrived. Meanwhile, she was standing at the counter playing on her iPhone. The food was the worst and we have eaten at different streets of ny before and loved their food. Bread was stale, salad wasn't fresh, pizza was just ok. The manager stood next to the bar the entire time playing on his phone. I never plan to visit this location again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to Streets of New York for over 10 years. We seated ourselves and was greeted shortly afterwards. We ordered some water which was good and didn't taste bad. We split a sub, STILL THE #1 black forest ham, cotto salami, provolone cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, streets italian dressing w/ fries. The waitress brought us two plates and already cut the sub in half for both us plus fries on both plates. The sub and fries were really good! The service stared out good and than the waitress stopped coming around until the end. We would still return to Streets of NY."}
{"text":"My husband and I just had the best experience a couple days ago at Streets of New York in Mesa.. We ordered the specialty pizza and absolutely loved it! But even better - our server, Craig, was outstanding. We can't say enough about his professionalism and ability to make our meal one to remember. We came back another day and the experience wasn't the same - different meal (Broaster Chicken) and different server.

There was some mix-up in our order which involved a long delay. Craig happened to spot us and came to our rescue. He immediately took charge and rectified the situation. 

Bottom line - Pizza was great; chicken was so-so; Craig was outstanding. Ask for Craig when you go. You will never be disappointed!"}
{"text":"While calling in a order the cashier was repeating my credit card number I asked her not to do that, if it is entered wrong I'll repeat it she made a sigh disregarded what I said. I went on to finish my cc number and then told her I have had several thousands dollars stollen and she should at least acknowledged she heard me. She disregarded that too. I asked to speak with her supervisor she said she was it for the night. I again told her she should have been more sensitive to what I was telling her instead of acting like I never asked her anything.  Buyer beware they just lost a customer."}
{"text":"We just left here before we had a chance to even sit down.  

We came here because it was 2 blocks from home.  It was not crowded.  The man who greeted us seemed annoyed we were there, 3 adults and  3 preteens.  We were told it would be 30 minutes before we could even order due to backed up kitchen and deliveries.  Okay, so we will have a couple drinks and conversation to kill some time, no problem.  He had walked away.  We started to sit at a table and he came over again and rudely repeated himself.  We got up and walked out and went to the 59th and Thunderbird location where we had originally visited once before, that was so good.  We just wanted to be closer to home.  
I will be calling their Corporate office."}
{"text":"This place is okay, but service seems to be hit or miss. One time I had to wait almost an hour just to get the check so I could pay and leave. When I finally got the check, it was for the table next to me. It took quite awhile for me to flag her down to tell her she gave me the wrong one. They weren't even busy so I don't know why it took so long. 

Recently I was served a sub on the wrong type of bread, but it was hard to get the waiter's attention and I was too hungry to have it sent back. I also needed napkins because the sub was dripping in dressing, but my waiter was messing around with the TV. I think the staff needs to be more available if the customer needs something or has a problem with their order."}
{"text":"I come here at least every couple of months because it's close to me and has great subs. It's usually not very busy which is a plus, and my food usually comes out pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Always friendly, orders always come quick. Love the cheese steak sandwich! The cheesy beer bread is so good too.
The actual location is on the small side but still lots of seating. We order from here often, really love it!!"}
{"text":"Walked in to grab a couple of slices of pepperoni pizza before getting to work (I was a tad bit early) I myself was not going to put down a whole pie so after being greeted almost immediately after walking in, I inquired with the gentleman at the counter. He went so far as to open up a menu and walk me through different lunch specials including a two slices with one topping for around six bucks. That's the one I replied. He offered a large drink in which I was inclined to request a mr pibb. Haven't been served yet but so far customer service is enjoyable, fast, friendly and efficient. So far so good
After getting my order I walked nearby to my workplace. Everything was awesome. From walking into the place- ordering- receiving order-enjoying- smiley face. All good"}
{"text":"Stuck in the hotel, so I placed an order for delivery after 90 minutes (estimated 45-60) food finally arrived cold and missing items and the driver copped an attitude because I didn't tip.  No napkins, No silverware and cold mediocre food, would not order from here again.  Tried to reach the manager but was placed on terminal hold,"}
{"text":"We planned a family dinner at this location and when we got to the door there was a sign that stated no firearms allowed. We do not feel safe in gun free zones so we turned around and went somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza, got sick didn't think much about it except it was a weird feeling in my stomach I never had before. I thought it cant be the pizza so I ate the left overs the next day and got that same weird stomach ache again. YES, it was the pizza. Ive got sick before from eating out, we all have but my concern is what caused that type of pain. I feel like somebody put something on it, I don't know, I hope I'm wrong but I just want to share my experience so if somebody gets that weird gut feeling they never had before......well, you have been warned. BTW, I have never ever had that feeling again and Im 52 yrs old and that was my first and only order from there."}
{"text":"Streets of New York failed us miserably.

My wife and I moved from Michigan to Chandler about two months ago. We had been occasionally ordering pizzas from Hungry Howie's or Papa John's, but after John Schnatter made some ridiculous comments about having to raise prices a whopping 14-30 cents because of the Affordable Care Act, we decided we should be ordering from local restaurants, preferably those that take care of the employees that helped build their businesses. For some inexplicable reason, Streets of New York decided not to do business with us.

On a Sunday evening, I placed a very simple order using their web site, which is obviously handled by a third party. I ordered a 14\" pizza with mixed bell peppers and pepperoni from the Ray & Kyrene location. The price was $21.50 plus tip. This is at least twice what I would have paid from one of the national pizza chains, but I didn't care because I was happy to support a local business. I received a confirmation email at exactly 5:30 pm that stated my dinner would arrive between 45 and 60 minutes later.

At 6:40 pm (70 minutes later), I called the restaurant to inquire as to the whereabouts of my pizza. My wife and I were quite hungry at this point. The woman I talked to told me, without ever ascertaining my identity, that the driver was running behind but was on his way.

At 6:49 pm (79 minutes in, now), the restaurant called me and I was advised again that the driver was running behind and due to the delay, I could not expect my dinner for approximately thirty more minutes. My patience, already stretched, was beginning to thin.

At 7:21 pm (111 minutes after ordering), I again called the restaurant, this time to simply cancel the order. The woman who answered the phone asked me if I was sure that's what I wanted to do (I was) because the driver had just left with my pizza and would arrive soon. I told her I had been told that before and simply wanted to cancel, and she stated she knew the status of my order and again said that it was already on the way. Amused by this, I asked her to tell me my name, since I hadn't introduced myself earlier and she hadn't asked. She stammered a bit about looking through her orders and then put me on hold for approximately a minute. Another woman then picked up the line and introduced herself as Amber, claiming to be the manager, and asked how she could help me. Again, I told her that I simply wanted to cancel my order. Again, she claimed that the driver had just left with three or four pizzas and was on his way. What she apparently didn't grasp was that this had been claimed much earlier and Streets of New York had already lost all credibility, and furthermore I just didn't care. She offered to give me 20% off my next order; again, I explained to her that I didn't want 20% off another order and that price wasn't the issue, I just wanted to cancel. She asked me what she could do for me and again I told her to cancel the order and reverse the authorization on my credit card. She finally obliged me, releasing my wife and me from a nearly two-hour wait for dinner. We went to Five Guys for burgers instead.

What should have been an enjoyable evening spent watching Netflix and enjoying a pizza from a local establishment was ruined by the staff's inability to make and deliver a pizza, or to provide basic customer service in the event of their failure. It is unlikely that we will ever again attempt to do business with Streets of New York given that we were ignored and repeatedly lied to by their staff."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and great salads! I have had pizza delivered twice now.  The first time the pizza arrived on time and the second time it arrived very early.  I have dined in once now and had good service.  They have several italian dishes on their menu but I go for the pizza."}
{"text":"Well Courtney is gone from here and apparently so is service. Tonight they have one server and she is doing everything she can to take care of customers 

Food is good however it is not good enough to get this type of service. Time to find a new pizza place in Surprise."}
{"text":"I went to streets earlier and have to say the food was amazingly delicious and the staff was so nice to me and got my food exactly the way I asked and I plan on coming back because it was so good there."}
{"text":"Got a great pizza deal I couldn't pass up. ...However sometimes you get what you pay for.  Although the price was right, the pizza was not.  Crust was a bit heavy and reminded of Bisquick.  The cheese was tasty, however the sauce was so sparse, they should have just left it off completely.

This \"pizza snob\" will not be returning for these pies..."}
{"text":"We ordered pizza (for delivery) from Streets on Sunday evening when the parents were over for Mother's Day.  I ordered 2 large 2 topping pizzas.  Total $46.00 - \"excuse me?\" I said.  *that was WITH a $5 off coupon. LOL  He explained that it was for 18 inch pizzas and asked if I wanted to do the 16 inch ones.  So yes 16 inches sounded much better where the total was $40.  Still a bit pricey for pizza I think but hey it fed 5 people so I guess you can't argue if you look at it that way.  They tacked on a hefty $3.00 delivery charge to that price by the way.  Pizza took a little over an hour to be delivered.  I guess there were a lot of Mothers not cooking on Mother's Day. hehe

The pizza was good... a little on the greasy side.  The crust was fresh and the toppings were good.  We ordered pepperoni with ricotta extra sauce and it was great.  I'm not a real fan of the taste of their ricotta-I have had better.  Their ricotta doesn't really melt so it seems a little dry. The other pizza was Hawaiian.  Nothing to complain about. My BF and I both agreed that their pizza has been better...not sure what it was.  Maybe we just weren't in the mood.

We have visited this place on several occasions.  The service is top notch.  They are on top of it and very organized.  The restaurant is located in this amazing little San Francisco style plaza.  The plaza itself is worth the visit.  We have also been to catered parties here with salad, pasta and pizza buffet style.  Great place to do a little get-together - say for 10 to 15 people.  The place isn't that big.  BTW the place is always packed on the weekends.  I believe they have outdoor seating but I have never seen anyone using it.  Probably because of the weather.  I think I like visiting the restaurant more than having the pizza delivered just for the New Yorker ambiance....but either experience is always a successful one.."}
{"text":"Love the sauce!  Here every week because it's like eating at grandmas house again!  Things got even better when they added the broasted chicken  all the restaurants in my native Upper Michigan serve it.  Way to go Stacey keep it up."}
{"text":"The restaurant is clean and the service was prompt.  The food was beyond unacceptable.  It takes work to serve pizza as inedible as the pizza served as this establishment.  Absolutely a total disappointment."}
{"text":"Streets of New York - not quite.  Don't get me wrong, this is perfectly decent pizza in the broad spectrum of the word pizza.  Always fresh and hot - a nice saucy pie with a generous amount of cheese and a huge amount of toppings to choose from.  Spinach dip was actually pretty tasty too.  The salads are nice, good selection and always fresh - they should offer their pizzas topped with your choice of salad.  The crust is the weakest link with these pies, they need to be crispy and slightly charred or thick and buttery - I'm happy either way but the pies seem to split the difference and not scratch either itch.

Service has always been good dining in and their slices to go hold up well on the trip home no matter how many toppings you get.  It's truly a 2.5 but I'll give them the +.5 for their honest effort to make every dining experience a good one."}
{"text":"5-Stars FANTASTIC service!!! 3-Stars for the pizza: GREAT sauce, and toppings, but the crust needs help. Nice, and thin, but dry and a bit crumbly (not sure why so many pizza places in AZ have this 'problem' - especially when claiming to be \"New York\" pizza). Of the places I've had pizza in Manhattan (mostly the Original Ray's, and Lombardi's) - those crusts are fantastic . . . no one in AZ (that I've had) has been able to come close. I'm still on the hunt for the perfect Arizona pizza."}
{"text":"Great place with great food. I have tried most of the menu and have yet to find something I don't like.  Robin, my waitress,  is always friendly and attentive to our needs."}
{"text":"I'm always excited to try new places, especially those close to home. We were headed elsewhere, but popped into Streets when we noticed they were open. The space is nicely decorated,  it offers a warm and welcoming atmosphere, with a large dining room and bar with a few taps. The sign suggested seating yourself so we grabbed a table in the center of the dining room.

We sat a little too long before someone came over. Our drink order was taken but we weren't certain what we wanted, a menu would be nice. He realized and brought two over. We had questions about slices that he couldn't answer. He walked off and I thought he was going to ask, but ended up on another task. Our waitress came over. Fortunately, she was able to help. Slices are pre-baked as cheese pizza and they add whatever toppings you like. 

She further explained they've been open two weeks in this location and the original location is up north. We mentioned this was our first visit and we'd like to know what's best to order. She suggested the slices, chicken parm, eggplant rollatini and a couple subs. I went with two slices: sausage and pepperoni. My husband chose the eggplant with penne.

Breadsticks were brought over with marinara sauce. The sauce was more of a paste which I don't care for, but my husband didn't mind it. The breadsticks were ok. Rosati's does these too and theirs are warmer, crisper and more chewy. They were too similar not to compare them. 

While we waited we noticed the restaurant had a lot of bodies, few customers (us and another table) and waits were longer than expected. I've never seen so many people moving about but doing absolutely nothing. Our waitress and the other checked on us periodically so service wasn't bad it just was up to par.

Finally our food was served. The pizza didn't look particularly appetizing, but I dug in. The sausage was terrible. I took two bites to confirm. It tasted like frozen pizza. My husband wouldn't even eat it and he eats most everything. He thought it tasted like microwavable pizza. The pepperoni was a bit better when loaded with chili flake. It was cooked more evenly  too. 

The pasta and eggplant rollatini were a bit better, but the eggplant wasn't heated all the way through. It was still cold in the center. We waited way too long and paid too much for what seemed to be microwaved eats. The bill was $23, usually I'd consider that pretty affordable, but in this case?  It was too much.

They have a lot of work to do. There are several solid pizza joints nearby, they will have to seriously step up their game to even begin to compete."}
{"text":"We have been going here since it opened and really loved the food, the people, the service, and the atmosphere.  We still love everything about it, but have found the service had been very slow the past few times we've been there.  I have had friends tell me the same.  We won't stop going by any means, but worth mentioning -- just make sure you're prepared for a little wait --  it is worth it.  :)   My favorite is their Spinach Salad, and my kids love their pizza and chicken fingers. Their passion cookie dessert is delish too. :)"}
{"text":"Its always hit or miss. Theres one woman who works here that just always has something more important she needs to do. Normally we try to sit with a different server but it always seems to be our luck that she's there. The foods great but that blonde lady needs to go."}
{"text":"Amazing food & service! Drop everything and get here! 
You won't regret! 
 
ANDDDD 15% off for police, fire & military peeps!"}
{"text":"On a Friday evening, we wanted to have pizza. We wanted something different from what we usually have and didn't want to wait to be seated. So, we went to Streets of New York. It's a decent place. We ordered fries and wow, that basket of fries was huge for two! The pizza was good but 10 inch wasn't enough for both of us. (They don't have an 11 inch; the next option is 14inch.) One small thing surprised me thought was that they have a bar but not a separate drinks menu. I believe they should have a drinks menu rather than drinks in the last part of  the main menu. Apart from that, good food and efficient service. Overall, a nice experience."}
{"text":"First, I'm only rating 1 star because they don't have a negative 5 trillion.
The fact that they use \" New York\" in the title is a down right insult!! New Yorkers would spit on this pizza, actually it tastes like they did! I would serve this to some ny rats but I would be scared for their health! 

Now for the specifics. Who do you think you are charging that much for a horrible eating experience! If you are going to charge 2 bux a topping it better not taste like bacon bits! We ordered wings and asked for extra crispy. They came burnt, over cooked and floating in oil! Just not edible! 

The pizza crust is rubber and just strange tasting! The sauce is filled with sugar, and it was runny! Watery and not filled with goodness. Toppings were not fresh at all. 

The location is ify,when you walk in its dark and filled with sadness. It took 5 mins at the counter for someone to even say hi 

In closing I can not believe this place is still open let alone a chain that people keep pouring money into! 

Seriously though I had better pizza at a gas station for 2 bux! You should be ashamed of yourself"}
{"text":"Not impressed. The fries were not very crisp & lacked a lot of the flavor I had expected. Also medium heat on wings seemed incredibly mild so I missed out on the spiciness factor I hoped for."}
{"text":"We are visiting from out of town and came across this place on Yelp.  Really good service, amazing fresh food (thin crust pizza and very yummy wings).  Nice find!"}
{"text":"First of all, I want to say our waitress Adyene was kind and attentive.  Today I took my mom out for lunch at Streets of NY at the 7st & Greenway location. The food was good. The problem I would like to bring to your attention is your kitchen staff. After eating my mother wanted some ice cream, we waited for 15+ minutes for your kitchen staff to get the ice cream for Adyene. I watched them chitchatting with a husky short man (he may have been a manager). After my mom finished her ice cream and she wanted some more. I ordered another two scoops. We waited and waited, after 20 minutes I canceled the order paid the bill & we left. If Adyene wasn't kind and attentive I would of given you 1 star that is how upset I was waiting to get my mother some ice cream."}
{"text":"I ordered from this store this evening while General Manager Jimmy was on duty and my order was incorrect.  The french fries were not fresh and they neglected to send my 2nd order of macaroni salad.  I called to advise them of their error and was passed off to Jimmy who did not offer to compensate me for my trouble. He would be glad to send me what I paid for but would have to pay for my antipasto salad which i requested in place of my error in ordering the gluten free salad. This is the second time i have had a problem at this store.  This will be the last time i place an order with any Streets of New York."}
{"text":"Love this location!!! All the servers and managers are amazing. They are super friendly and always quick with the service. Food is tasty and the prices are great. This is my spot and has become my go to spot to kick back and relax!!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I went to this restaurant for the first time and found it to be very good.  One of us had pizza, 2 that had whole wheat linguine pasta with marinara sauce and 1 had broccoli cheese soup and a half turkey sandwich.  All was very good tasting, and hot when delivered.  The service was very good, friendly wait staff.  We would recommend this place for casual dining and we will return! Lunch prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"This is our go to place for pizza, fried zucchini, hot wings, chocolate cake, and more.   Ginger and her staff are welcoming and do a wonderful job. We have been going here for over 3 years and will continue."}
{"text":"I would first like to say that streets of New York has great food. That being said their customer service is terrible. We have a joke in our family that we say the motto should be \"Streets of New York, hope you have time to eat here.\"

They then take 5 to 10 minutes to get a drink order and then they finally get your food order food usually takes about 45 minutes to an hour. It not uncommon for your food to be incorrect. For example, this week we ate pizza and hot chicken wings with flats only. They gave us pizza with chicken wings that we're not Flats only and they were mild. The server did not come again for another 15 minutes for me to actually say this is not what I ordered by then we have already eaten and decided that we would just pay. 

If they ever change their customer service I would change my star rating to a much higher one. Also, when we eating it's very common to see the waitresses and bussers standing around talking to each other or sitting at the round table near the kitchen."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for years! Very friendly staff, place seems to be managed well as it is very clean and everyone here greats you with a smile. The food is great. Love the #7 Best Of Everything!"}
{"text":"Awful.  Ordered 16\" pizza and chopped anti-pasto salad.  The Pizza was doughy and the topping just slid off the soggy crust.  Maybe I'm a snob, but in Chicago, pizza restaurants know how to make a good pie.  This was just a waste of $27.00.  2 bites was all that was required to banish this pizza to the streets of New York.  Thats where the garbage is picked up."}
{"text":"I had sandwiches delivered and they were both soggy and not so great. Maybe they would be better if I had eaten in."}
{"text":"My niece ordered two Cob Salads to go.  The order got messed up and they thought it was supposed to be in house.  So instead of making new salads they threw the salads into to go boxes that looked like crap.  Cob Salads are supposed to be nice and neat these looked like a complete mess.  I think they took advantage of her because she is only 17.  Wont be returning."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this Streets location.  Fantastic pizza and the antipasto salad is really incredible with all of the best ingredients."}
{"text":"Streets of New York is a cute pizza joint with pretty good food. I love the location, decor, and overall feel of the place. The server/hostess was accommodating but never cracked a smile. Then again, she earned brownie points for getting our order right (no small feat in Vegas).   

My husband is from New York and this is by no means New York pizza. I have to say though that It was pretty darn good pizza anyway. I also tried their pasta and it was very good as well. 

We will have to go back and try out this place again. We may also get delivery next time (they deliver within a 5 mile radius). Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone who wants a pretty good meal all the way out in Centennial Hills."}
{"text":"Solid new York style Italian. Definitely recommend ordering to go as the ambiance leaves a lot to be desires."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a quick lunch or dinner, very good at getting you in and out if you are in a hurry!  We love all the servers and managers they have working there, really make you feel special and that you are top priority!  Reccomend the pizza, cheesestake, and chicken tenders!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I ordered online for pick up. Only took 15 minutes. The food was just bad.  The dozen boneless wings (honey bbq) tasted like they were leftovers that were reheated in a microwave, and were saturated in the sauce.  Garlic cheesy bread was burnt and soggy.  There was a HAIR in the meatballs. And my greek salad with chicken was nothing to write home about for the $13 price.  Total bill was $35. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Love love love their wings. I love that I can walk to such a great little neighborhood hangout and even sit outside and have a glass of wine with pizza and wings. Love!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm from the East Coast (an hour from \"the city\"), been here for 4 years and just now found the authentic taste and atmosphere at Streets of New York on Norman Rockwell Lane (also my favorite artist growing up).  I've been looking for.  The food is fantastic, but the atmosphere created by the owner, Robin, was what I miss most about back home.  Awesome food, best service!"}
{"text":"LOVE THE HAPPY HOUR!
I've read some good reviews and some horrible reviews about this Streets. I have reviewed this location before, but felt that I should update my review after reading about the filthy tables and poor customer service.  We usually visit during happy hour (4 - 6 PM).  I know the quality of service depends on the server but our service has always been excellent. I have never seen a dirty table while I have been there.  The wait staff is quick to clean up.  The cheesy bread is great; and their pizza by the slice is an excellent price.  I highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best \"Happy Hour\" menus I have found.  Great food and good prices on wine and appetizers.  Try the garlic toast and the artichoke dip...Both are great!"}
{"text":"It was all right... ordered a Cesar salad and it came w/onions and tomatoes? Pizza wasn't all that great either..."}
{"text":"The pizza was very decent. The wings were gross. The sauce was weird and definitely not traditional hot wing sauce.  The wings were dry and overlooked.  Good service, good price.  Ick food."}
{"text":"FRIDAY@2:pm
I ordered carry out brosted chicken
&  potato wedges $22+ was 
the worst meal I ever had potatoes were half-rotten we have eaten there before Dine-in and  carryout but never again VINCENT M."}
{"text":"AMAZING pizza, friendly staff, fair prices."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to this place twice now and the pizza and the service were excellent both times!  We have gotten the pesto and veggies pizza and added chicken breast and artichokes. The waiter was the same both times and was excellent..."}
{"text":"Will not orderfrom this place again. After an hour and a half (90 minutes), our order finally arrived, only to becold and incomplete. The mangement has no care or any type of customer service and acts as if she is entitled to our business. 

HORRIBLE, INCOMPITENT MANGEMENT!!!!"}
{"text":"Where's the sauce? I guess since this is Phoenix, they gotta make the pizza dry like the desert. Or maybe there's a shortage of marinara, either way if I want dry bread with cheese I can make it myself for under $10. Seriously get your sauce together!"}
{"text":"I'm from NY and they're was nothing NY about this place.  I ordered the chicken pram and got tomato sauce over cubed chicken lol.  What the what?  I really feel bad leaving 3 stars but there is no way I can add another, the 3rd star goes to the server she saved the day on this one"}
{"text":"Ew. I've eaten at another streets location and this one did not compare in the slightest. The pasta was clearly reheated, the bread was stale and the salad was sub-par at the most. If you want REAL italian, go to rocco's."}
{"text":"Have been there many times over the years.  the wait staff have always been friendly if sometimes overworked.  The pasta is quite good as are the pizzas and sandwiches.  My only complaint is the broasted chicken which was recently added to the menu.  I have tried it twice now and it was rubbery both times.  It is a good place to eat but, unless your tastes are far different from mine, avoid the chicken"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza place in Centennial as far as I'm concerned. The food was good, the beer even better and the ambiance could not have been better! It'll b a great place to come and watch sports..."}
{"text":"Great Margarita pizza and chicken wings we had it delivered and it was fast and great service"}
{"text":"Thank you Streets...  we had a fun night with great tasting food.  Excellent service, too!  Karaoke night was a blast!"}
{"text":"These guys are taking it pretty rough on some of these reviews but I used to go there when I was in high school so thought I'd see if they were still any good. My pizza delivery has been nothing but positive and much tastier than any of the chains that deliver in my area. New York combo is damn delicious. This will be my go-to pizza delivery going forward."}
{"text":"had the pastrami sandwich most excellent. could have used a few more fries. staff was Friendly and poured a cold brew."}
{"text":"We had a medium pizza, half New Yorker and half veggie.  It was average at best. You could tell our server wanted to be anywhere but working here, no smile, no small talk, no personality.  The pizza came to a little over $21 for a medium, with tax. If you're looking for average at best, this is it."}
{"text":"The young girl whom I spoke to would not let me speak to the Manager about our burnt pizza. I've ordered from this place for the past 12 months and had great pizza, but a bit slow on delivery. She would only give me the owner's email. To this day I don't understand why owner's are afraid to talk to their customers. Doesn't make sense to me at all and the customer service has gone down hill. Time to start shopping for a new pizza joint."}
{"text":"We stopped by last night for some pizza and dessert, and to watch some of the closing ceremonies of the Olympics, since we knew they would have a TV nearby.   The pizza was pretty good, and our dessert was delicious. Really can't go wrong when you have a gooey cookie with ice cream melting on top, and we enjoyed every bite.

Probably the best thing about our meal though was our server, Jason.  He was very friendly, and the service was consistently great. He might even be the best server we've had in a restaurant in years. And that's saying a lot, as we dine out frequently.

The only advice I have for this restaurant mgt. is that you should probably dust, and just in general clean up the place. I know this location has been around for many years, and it looks very dated. Something as simple as dusting the wood blinds on the front windows would go a long way. As we sat at our booth near the bar, we could not help but notice all of the dust and other debris on the window blinds and window sill.  Obviously this isn't very appetizing to customers."}
{"text":"Not impressed. The offer lunch specials at a great cost. I ordered a slice of pizza and 6 medium wings. Was disappointed with the pizza being super thin and hardly had any taste, the wings weren't any better they had no taste and they were super dry. I don't plan on coming back."}
{"text":"I come here about once a week and it's really good 

Try the baked minestrone soup! The service is some time slow, but it's worth the wait.  They also have really good baked chicken."}
{"text":"Do not go here for pizza!! The pizza arrived late for delivery by 40 minutes, was cold and like cardboard.. hardly any sauce and tasteless crust. YUCK! Definitely not like NYC pizza..."}
{"text":"Food is good, but crust can be a little more done. It's that bread type of dough so, you'll want to eat it as soon as you get home while it's still hot, otherwise it can get kinda tough and chewy. I came here Sunday night and waited 40 minutes for one 16 inch chicken garlic pizza and 2 pieces of dark meat broaster's chicken (as you might of guessed, I like chicken :P). The other lady waited almost as long. She came back in to ask my opinion on her cheese pizza and I told her that yes it is overdone and that I wouldn't eat it. They were good about giving her a refund, but they can't give back her time loss. I think they might have given her some broasted chicken, because she didn't stick around too long after. Their excuse was that they were overwhelmed, but I thought to myself, \"self don't they have a time oven?\" If they don't, they might want to hire more people, or tend to the oven better and also think about cheese pizza being cooked to long vs my chicken pizza not cooked enough, because more stuff needs more time than something less like a plain chesse."}
{"text":"Bought a groupon so we decided to give this place a try, went on a Friday night 5:30pm and it was pretty slow so we walked right in and grabbed a table (seat yourself). Staff was nice and prompt, we ordered an appetizer spinach artichoke dip and it was just ok, kind of tasted mayo-ey my wife liked it though.  We got Mac n cheese for my son and we shared a pizza 1/2 white pizza and 1/2 G'no salami somn or other.. Pizza was very good and was cooked just right, the highlight of the night was the gooey cookie and vanilla ice cream dessert, well worth the $6. We'll def come here again, location is kind of cool as well."}
{"text":"my huband and i went in for dinner tonight and it was pretty slow. 2 guys were at the bar and just one other couple having dinner. I was initially shocked at how dirty everything was. lots of dirty tables and the floors were filthy. Service was not great. Needless to say I just wasnt empressed. The cooks were good though food was hot and yummy!"}
{"text":"Streets of New York serves a decent pie.  Contrary to what some people say it's even better than some NYC pie.  I've had plenty of mediocre slices in the city that allegedly has the best in the world.  The 2 slice & a drink lunch special for $5 is hard to top in the area.  You can spend more of a lackluster value meal at McDonald's across the lot.  I've also had the lasagna.  Decent meal but the portion is too small.  Yeah, you'll find better around but Streets of New York isn't bad.

The service is always good.  One nice touch is that they will show you the pie before you walk out the door with it.  I've never been anywhere else that does that.  They make sure you're satisfied before you leave."}
{"text":"Awful damn service, sat down and no one served us. Watched other people get in after us and get served. Never again, this place can suck it!!!!!"}
{"text":"We came in for carryout and decided to eat in ... Blake was great,he didn't charge us for the sodas. First time here , Pizza was amazing!"}
{"text":"Way too much grease for our entrees.  My son had the chicken tenders ( while yes deep fried, the amount and clear moist saturation was very distasteful).  I ordered the Tuscan pesto chicken which I had to drain ( pour ) excessive amount of olive oil / pesto.  This has definitely turned my opinion.  Sorry Streets, we will no longer be ordering.  I am not sure if it was because we did grubhub versus in house dining?  Either way , my stomach and coated tongue are against further purchase. My son says he still likes the pizza by the slice."}
{"text":"Came to Phoenix for KC Royals! spring training.   In the mood for pizza Sunday night.  Great service, great pizza.  Simple as that. I read a lot of over the top poor reviews.  I don't think good pizza will make unhappy people happy.  Place does get pretty busy and could probably use another worker.  Guy out front was stretched pretty thin answering phones, and waiting tables.  Definitely worth it, but owner should definitely have 1 more person to float up to the front."}
{"text":"Well, the chocolate cake was the best thing about my order tonight that's why i gave it two stars instead of one. The fettuccine Alfredo tasted like the plastic container it came in and the pizza was overcooked."}
{"text":"I just ate a large thin crust pizza from here and it wasnt very good at all. The crust was extremely hard and the pizza wasnt hot at all. It almost had a cardboard taste, not to mention we just got cheese on the pizza and it cost $18. Very disappointed we spent that much money on this sub par product, and we wont be returning customers."}
{"text":"Sadly, and much to the chagrin of my kids, we're done with Streets.

We've eaten there an average of 2 times per month since arriving in the valley in 2010, and their cheese slices are one of my kids' favorite meal.  The \"Still the #1\" hoagie is amazing, and the Broaster chicken was a great addition to their menu.  Unfortunately, the quality control and customer service at this location have taken a nose dive over the past few months.

Our last order was the straw that broke the camel's back.  When we got the food inside, I noticed that they had left two appetizers out of the delivery (which the driver had claimed were in the bag, but weren't).

Hey look, I understand that things happen.  I called to let them know, and was put on hold for about 5 minutes right off the bat.  No problem, it's a busy weekend night.  Finally, a young woman answered, and I tell her about the mix-up.  Sounding irate, she asked me to hold again... this time for well over 10 minutes.  When she got back on the line, she barked \"SO DO YOU WANT US TO DRIVE THEM ALL THE WAY BACK OUT THERE, OR WHAT?\" in just about the most snotty and condescending voice you can imagine.  I said, \"Uh... no.  How about a credit transaction on my card?\"

\"FINE.  WE'LL PUT THE MONEY BACK ON YOUR CARD.\"   click.

Naturally, the credit never hit my account.  It was around 10 bucks, no big deal... but what I can't tolerate is being made to feel like I'M the jerk for even bringing it up, and especially when the derision is coming from a snotty, gum-chomping teenage girl.  

It's her job to make sure the orders are correct, not mine.  All she had to do was say, \"Oh, I'm sorry!  We'll get that put back on your card right away.  Please forgive us.\"  and they would still have a continued loyal customer.  Instead, little miss Veruca Salt here treats me like a war criminal.

So farewell for now, Streets.  I hope you can work out your staffing challenges.  I'll check back in a couple of years.

4 stars = Food / 1 star = Service"}
{"text":"Worst customer service. Don't know the mans name but he worked during lunch time. They should really have a server because it's obviously too much for him to handle. In all my years in hospitality I've never heard someone be so rude about asking for garlic. It also took 35 minutes to get 4 slices. Definitely won't be going back to this location."}
{"text":"The pizza was delicious.  Came in, sat at the bar, and ordered a pizza.  The problem was that they put my pizza in the wrong place and forgot about me...  attentive bar service, but pizza was left to sit.  45 minutes later they brought me a room temperature pizza, which was really good for room temp pizza.  I'd have given 5 stars had the pizza been served to me in less than 45min and hot."}
{"text":"We went out of our norm to have your pizza tonight and pasta salad because we really like it and were hungry.  Unfortunately it was the worst we have ever had.  We were told to pick up in 30 minutes - my husband was there 10 minutes early and the pizza was cold and the taste was not fresh...very bland and very disappointing.  I ordered a side of pasta salad because it usually is my favorite.  That was extremely disappointing.  The salad had a flavor that was so aweful I think it had been sitting in the frig for at least a week and had taken on all of the other flavors in the frig....so not good that I prayed I wouldn't get sick from the few bites that I ate.  Seriously it tasted soured and spoiled.  It is unfortunate that we spent $25 for a dinner that wasn't edible.  We won't be driving the extra to order any time soon.  Barros or Orgegano's will be getting our business.
Sincerely,  Disappointed customers"}
{"text":"We have tried Streets of New York off of Camelback a few times before we went here.
The quality of food is much better at the other location.
The Tatum location started our meal by serving stale bread knots. Now, they are free, but they were inedible.  
We ordered a large cheese pizza and large Greek salad to share.
The pizza was dry and disappointing.  Our Greek salad was decent and the best part of the meal.
There was only one other group of diners while we were there and we still had to get up and go find our server to bring our bill."}
{"text":"Our server was excellent, always checked on us to make sure our drinks were filled and to check up on how the food was, even though she was the only server there while waiting on 5 other tables. 5 stars for her! 

On to the food, it wasnt that great. I ordered a create your own pasta with fetta Alfredo. It was flavorless. My girlfriend ordered a chicken parm pasta which wasn't too bad. The chicken tasted alright, and the marinara sauce on her penne was good. My mother ordered a 10 inch pizza, and it was pretty average. Nothing extravagant. I most likely won't be returning."}
{"text":"I ordered a gluten-free pizza and a slice of chocolate cake over the phone. The hostess said it would be about 30 mins before I got my order delivered to my front door. 18 mins later, the driver arrived with my hot pizza and cake. I was very happy with my order and looooooved the chocolate cake. It was probably the BEST chocolate cake I've ever had: moist, rich, and real-chocolate tasting. In fact, I should have split the slice with a friend because it was too good. In my experience, the food was good; dessert superb; the driver fast and polite; and the hostess polite and accurate. I can't complain."}
{"text":"First, I NEVER give a restaurant five stars. But the food here is pretty darned good.  I recommend the thin crust pizza.  It beats the heck out of the \"big name\" delivery pizza places.  I ALMOST gave them five stars because they have anchovies!  Almost no pizza stores offer them anymore.

The pasta and subs are also quite good.

You won't go wrong here"}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic New York style pizza, this is not it.  However, having said that, the food was quite decent and the service was really friendly.  We had the regular \"New York\"  style pizza, cheese ravioli, gf pizza and beer cheese dip with garlic bread.  Everything was tasty and came piping hot.  I want to come back and try their fried chicken so I'll be back.  This is a solid neighborhood place with good food, clean establishment and friendly service."}
{"text":"A little expensive, but they've got a pretty decent pizza. Booths are a little small and uncomfortable. Wait staff is always friendly and competent, and I'd say about 70% of the female staff is hot. It makes the food taste that much better!"}
{"text":"We love this place, we go there a lot since we live just minutes away,  the servers are very friendly and we love the food and desserts there, there's nothing we haven't liked from there yet.  
I didn't give them the full 5 stars because sometimes there's not enough servers working at busy times and we have noticed only one server for all tables."}
{"text":"Terrible service. All the workers were gabbing in the back. They forgot parts of my to go order. Sandwiches are skimpy and cold. Told a 10 minute wait, was more like 25-30 minute wait. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"I use to love this place, after a while menu items and quality have changed. I was give 3 tiny meatballs for almost $10.00 a total waste of money! These meatballs were so small I honestly laughed! for that cost I really could have made them 3 itty bitty things myself."}
{"text":"Seriously surprised at the overall low-ish rating for this joint.

 Let me start by saying I am pregnant.  I am picky, hungry, and have something to say about just about everything (poor husband).

Hub and I decided at the very last second to try this place instead of KFC.  More options.  3PM on a Sunday is totally dead, and there is one server for the entire place, but seemingly handled well.  We chose to order our food to go.  
12 Piece White Meat Broaster Chicken family meal
Make your own 14\" PIzza with chicken, spinach, and provolone. Half Cheese

Took about 35 minutes for everything to come out, by then I was falling apart being so hungry.  One look at the pizza and was pleasantly surprised at how tasty it looked.  Eyes of pregnancy can be deceiving...however, not this time!!  Every bite of all this food was way more delicious than I was anticipating.  The broaster chicken is done to perfection; juicy, crispy, hot.  The pizza was nicely browned on top, with plenty of the toppings we requested.  Taste was phenom.

I literally just finished eating and had to rave about how good this was.  Husband and I were equally impressed, and will return to try more goodies.  

Not sure on service...girl taking orders was pleasant and got everything right."}
{"text":"Ordered our dinner next one thing I do say is the delivery ...was good and fast! Food itself was bit tasteless. Pizza was too bland and wings needed more flavor. We also got a Passion Cookie, we'll that did not go so well.....it was burnt! Overall our first experience trying this place was not so great, most likely won't order again."}
{"text":"The broaster chicken was very good... The thin crust new york combo pizza was awesome too... I'm not from Vegas but I'm glad I stopped (by accident) here cuz the food and service were GREAT..."}
{"text":"People are right when they say Streets of New York is slow, but it is fresh, so what can you expect. I found this gem on a lunch break one day (don't go on an hour lunch, you may run out of time). The wings are delicious. Since I moved to Scottsdale, they have to be the best wings I have had. The pizza is good as well, I haven't found a favorite yet."}
{"text":"This place is new.  It's nice inside and I like the person that served us.  The pizza was great!  The breadsticks came out first and unfortunately they were cold but the marina sauce was good.  We came for the pizza not the breadsticks so it's not a problem.  The only real problem is the price.  It was pretty expensive.  We used a $4 coupon from LiveDeal and for one 16 inch pizza it was still $18 just for the one pizza alone, not including tip.  I love pizza and if you love pizza you will like this place too regardless of the price being high or not."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed with how this restaurant has gone downhill. This weekend my husband and I stopped by to grab a quick pizza before running errands and when we walked in there was not a single customer in the place. On a weekend!!! The garlic knots brought to our table were cold and tough; they were free so we couldn't complain but I would have never paid for those.  The pizza was alright, but definitely not worth the price. My family used to love coming here for the amazing food, what the heck happened?????"}
{"text":"We stopped by at 2:30 in the afternoon for a slice of pizza which was good but the dining tables and floor were really messy and there was no one else there eating! Someone rung us up for 2 slices and disappeared and in a couple minutes a server appears asking if we were ready to order??? I  would try the food again but not sure of the service."}
{"text":"Mmmm mmm mmmmmm. Great pizza, friendly delivery people, love this place! I'd eat it more, but I know pizza everyday isn't good for the wasteline! Yum!"}
{"text":"First time here and I will definitely be back! Got a slice of pepperoni pizza and a drink for $7, pizza was fresh and so delicious!! (So good I wish I got two slices!). The girl working the register was super friendly as well!"}
{"text":"If I hadn't tried the pizza this place would have gotten 5 stars...  Don't get me wrong, their pizza isn't bad, however their other food is INCREDIBLE!!!  

We have ordered from here a couple times and I haven't tasted one thing I dint like!  I asked to try the Bolognese sauce thinking it would be as easy as putting some in a bowl, however I later found out they prepared a small portion just for me to taste...  It was very good...  My husband ended up ordering the lasagna with meat sauce and I ordered the fettuccine Alfredo with garlic chicken...  Both were incredible!!

Definitely looking forward to trying more dishes on the menu!"}
{"text":"Been on the hunt recently for good pizza joints close to home. Drove by this place, but looked more like a sit down place, so I called to see if the sell pizza by the slice. They do! I had to wait like 6 minutes, but no biggy. It was so good too, especially because it was really fresh. It's a chill place, but I totally recommend this place for pizza."}
{"text":"As far as chain pizza restaurants go, this one takes the cake.  My husband and I dine at this location at least twice a month and we order the same thing every time, 14 \" thin crust pizza with cheese, pepperoni and mushroom (which I crave), 2 side salads with ranch and our beers of choice.  The night waiter there now recognizes us and seats us at \"our table,\" and always remembers our drinks.  Their new menu is AWESOME, the new thin crust pizza is some of the best we've eaten anywhere!  It's super thin and cracker crispy, lots of toppings and flavor.  We can always count on Streets to be a quick in/out, tasty dinner option at the end of the day. Yum!"}
{"text":"I, along with a couple of friends visited this place last Friday night. Normally we go the 59th and Thunderbird location, but our server Kristin wasn't there so we left. (A tip to anyone going there, turn around and leave if Kristin is not working. We've had gone there a couple times and the service was horrendous.) Anyway, the service lacked in every way. We waited forever for our food and when it arrived, it was sadly not worth the wait. I know that part the server could not control, but she could've had a better attitude about it. When we asked another server for a refill, we couldn't have been more uncomfortable due to the whole attitude issue. I'm sorry Streets Of New York, but I can't seem to be willing to understand the wait time if the server is treating us like a nuisance. I guess it takes a special kind of server to keep the good paying customers around... What a shame."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my most personal reviews: A few days ago I wrote a review for another Streets of New York that I visited. The service was slacking and the food was bland. In that review, I mentioned a young woman by the name of Kristin. She has been MY waitress for the past few months (yes I'm that selfish). Anyway, I met Kristin when she came to my business and handed out some menus. She was very persuasive ;) so a few colleagues and I visited that evening. The food was fantastic, the restaurant was dimly lit but clean, and the service was phenomenal! We asked for a manager and was told he would be right out, but never showed. So since we didn't get a chance to tell management, here is a review for everyone to see.
* I would not recommend this place for delivery. We ordered from the catering menu to be brought to our shop and the order was incorrect. The manager took our order so I would've thought she would've done a better job. Although, her English was rough so I'll hand that to her. 
* Also, my girlfriends and I stopped in a couple other times when Kristin was not serving. The service was slacking and we had to ask twice for everything! If you want good service, you know who to ask for. ;)
* Don't get your hopes up if the manager says he will come to your table to meet you. Seeing the manager is like seeing Bigfoot. 
* Last but not least, check your dishes! Sometimes the dishes aren't as clean as you would like them to be...

I hope I was helpful! :)"}
{"text":"Worst Experience Ever!

The Owner/Manager at this location is the poorest excuse of a manager at a customer-oriented business. He is a JERK. 

I used to order delivery from this location all the time.

One night, about 25 min. before the location closed, I called and asked if it were too late to order for delivery. The woman said No, that placing an order was completely fine. So I ordered online for delivery and put it on my debit card. They charged my card nearly $70, however no one showed up after 60 minutes, I waited another 20 minutes before calling the location only to get constant ringing, they were obviously closed at that time and no one called me or emailed about my order.

The next day, I waited for them to open and called. The manager got on the phone and I explained what had happened and told him I wanted a refund because we never got the delivery, to which he rudely replied - we were there, you didn't answer. And he said \"you're not getting a refund\", laughed, and hung up on me!

First, saying that they came? Complete lie. Not only do I have a dog (chihuahua) that barks like crazy at the slightest knock or noise by the front door, but also, our front door was open with the screen door closed. We not only would have heard the person, but we would have seem them and my dog would have been barking like the world was ending. 

Second, HE HUNG UP ON ME! Total pet peeve of mine. My teenage daughter doesn't even hang up on me and this \"grown\" man who is supposed to work in customer service does?!

I tried calling back and was hung up on for a second time!

I wasn't getting anywhere with him, so I went online and sent a message to corporate. Within 2 hours, a lady from the corporate office contacted me, apologized, and told me that they spoke with the location and informed them to process the refund, and that all I needed to do was follow up with the location. The woman at the corporate office was so polite and friendly :)

I didnt want to follow up with the manager who had been so rude and hung up on me, so I decided that I would go to the location and hopefully be able to deal with another employee.

So myself, my 16 year old daughter, and her 17 year-old friend (I wanted a couple witnesses) drove to the location. 

We went inside and I explained my situation to the lady at the counter, she was rude as well, but not nearly as bad as the male manager. She said that only the manager,  the one with whom I DID NOT want to deal with, could help me.  

The manager was outside, so the lady called him in. As soon as he flung open the front doors, he started literally yelling at me in front of the other restaurant guests and employees! He swore at me and berated me and barely let me get in a word. He was furious that I contacted corporate. I kept my cool, again asked for my refund and he was so mean and began processing my refund in such an angry manner that he nearly broke my debit card.

I will never order from this location again, that man should not be able to manage a cage of lab rats let alone a restaurant. He was an angry man with the charisma of a brick. 

I encourage everyone to steer clear of this location. I would hate for anyone else to go through the humiliation of being yelled at and belittled in front of complete strangers."}

{"text":"Wow, tough crowd of reviewers 4 this place which I don't understand as all my experiences here have always been 1derful whether Dine~in, drive~up window (yes' they have 1 4 pick~up orders) or Delivery! 

   I've been going 2 this place since a dear friend of mine introduced me 2 their lunch special back in my art~school days. (LONG time ago) I remember being surprised by the unique option of zucchini 4 a topping & it's still an absolute fave 4 me 2 this day! Hope they don't remove it from their menu as I'd certainly miss it.

    My most recent visit was dining in the restaurant w/ a dear girlfriend early evening & we were catered 2 by a young man who gave several options 2 customize our pie according 2 my dietary restrictions. We started w/ their Artichoke Spinach dip & Bruschetta ~ Both were AHhmazing & the Gorgonzola Pear Salad was Delectable w/ it's candied walnuts, cranberries, pears, gorgonzola cheese & sweet pear dressing on spring mix greens. MMMmm!

   So we both ordered a large pie w/ the intention of bringing home the rest 2 our households... well, guess it's rather self~explanatory that not very much was left & we were restraining ourselves as it was, Oops... kinda. Tee~hee! Not even much crust was left from the slices we 8 & I 'ususally' don't eat that,.. but theirs is good!

   She had a Mediterranean which she Luved & they made me a KILLER Gluten~Free White Pizza w/ Zucchini & Alfredo sauce instead of tomato. I've also had their Vegetarian's Delight Cold Sub, Eggplant Rollatini Pasta, Classic Margherita Pizza & Pesto Veggie & Cheese Pizza which r all personal favor8s. I can also attest 2 the Baked Ziti, Cheese Ravioli & their Greek salad being pretty great when I've been in the mood 4 those. Nothing has ever been lacking in flavor & freshness of food or service so my experiences have been 5* in every way, now & even way back in the day. (Time machine not included)! ;-)"}
{"text":"Streets is the best quick, casual dinner place to get a quality slice of pizza. I've been coming here since I was a kid and I've never had a bad experience!"}
{"text":"Service was great and place was very clean. However, we ordered two lunch plates of penne (alfredo & the pink sauce with chicken) the pasta was gross. Stuck together and gummy. The chicken has to be frozen, prepackaged stuff. And it was $10 per plate for a lunch portion? Will not go back. My son was like \"we should have gone to Chili's\" and that's saying something."}
{"text":"Got to taste Gus's food for the first time. Having it delivered to my home. The delivery guy was ok. The only thing I did not care for is he drove up with full on base coming from his car. I don't even do that in my own neighborhood. Not very respectful. The food on the other hand was delicious delicious. 
We ordered the supreme pizza, a veggie sub, and a calzone. Super tasty food. By far the best pizza my family and I have had here in Az. Hope they stay the same every time we visit or get it delivered."}
{"text":"Not sure what is wrong with this place now days. Used to be decent but has gone drastically downhill and is extremely expensive compared to other comparable pizza places. Ordered pepperoni with roasted garlic. Got thin crust with ham on it. Didn't order a salad. Got a salad. Didn't order garlic bread. Got garlic bread. Got charged for all of it and the help said. Well that's what you ordered. Never again."}
{"text":"A great first impression can really set the tone. I had called in to place an order for delivery. The young man who answered the phone had me at hello. Sterling your enthusiasm came right through. 
We wanted to try the broasted chicken, and I have to say it was delicious. It was seasoned perfectly, crunchy with every bite. It was one of the best pieces of chicken I have had in a while. My DH said the wedges that came with had good flavor.
We enjoyed the cole slaw which had a slight vinegar tang. The macaroni salad,
was also a good side choice. 
The delivery was right on time. The prices reasonable. 
We look forward to trying other menu items and going to dine in."}
{"text":"A place that does not care if there is soap to wash your hands in the bathroom....same bathroom they use....just don't even go there.  They have purell in the front, so I thought I was saved.  Empty!  And the tables were filthy. Not just sticky but layers of crud built up like on the floor of a brawling barroom.  Oh my oh my.  Don't don't don't go here."}
{"text":"Ive ordered twice from this location, twice they have gotten my order wrong. We tried their artichoke spinach dip and it's the worse we've ever had, greasy bland and burnt. The bread was hard and broke my fiancee tooth. 

The pasta was over cooked. Ordered two meatballs per kids meal for our two kids they only got one each and never received their sprites. 

Their Hawaiian pizza was bland and pineapples were not sweet.

For amount of money we spent, ($120 w/tip) not ordering from here again when I can order from Dominos and get better food and cheaper."}
{"text":"Ordered a family pack of their broasted chicken and sides. The chicken was so over cooked it was try and hard. Not even tasty at all. In addition the sides were terrible."}
{"text":"The tea was just brownish water...my husband ordered 2 dozen bone in wings in hot. They were DISGUSTING. We have eaten here for years and he always went there for the wings and said they were THE BEST. Not sure where they get their wings from now but to be honest,  theu tasted lile the frozen tyson ones that we sampled at Costco.  Just more hot wing sauce. There was no meat on them. Just this weird jelly like fat substance. They were greasy and gooey. Disgusting.  We will kever be back. We frequented this place for the wings and baked minestrone soup (which used to also be good). Now it is just brown gravy and stale bread. I saw a half a noodle. Thats it. We tipped our waiter because it is not his fault that the food has gone down hill...SEVERELY.  45 Dollars and an hour of our life we will never get back. You have lost very loyal customers with the shortcuts you guys are taking. Never never EVER AGAIN. If you want fatty weird jelly on a chicken bone though, this is the place for you to go"}
{"text":"Streets of New York has really good food! My fiance and I love everything from the appetizers to the desserts.

I think the service could use a little improvement though. The staff is friendly, but could check in on the tables a little more. It was hard to track down our waiter to get a refill even though it wasn't very busy on the last two occasions we visited."}
{"text":"O.M.G!! Visiting from California and we ate here on our last day and it was uuuuuumaaaaaaaazing!! Hands down best food we had in awhile...and we don't review too often, but this place was worth taking the time to write a review !!"}
{"text":"Found the best soups here!   We have also tried the Spaghetti and meatballs and the flavors were good.  Prices are fair, the menu has many more items we want to try.  For pizza, Giordano's has spoiled us but SONY has great soup and cheesy bread."}
{"text":"Always have a good meal here. Any chance you could publish nutritional information? Most every chain has nutritional info out there, but I'd love it for this place!  My teens love their pizza, I love their eggplant Parmesan and spaghetti with marinara. Salads are great and I love the emailed coupons to defray the cost of our meals!  Good for beers, relaxing with family and a good place to eat with the out of towners."}
{"text":"We visited Streets of New York while on vacation in Phoenix.  It is a casual place.  Their menu is quite interesting and I was pleasantly surprised at their pizza.  Although not true \"New York\" style, it is a very thin, crisp crust. They also have a hand-tossed option, but that has no place in a \"New York\" pizza joint in my opinion.

The meatball appetizer was very good and the pizza was great. Their menu seemed to have plenty of other options as well - like I said, great food, great pizza...just not true \"New York\" style.

The reason for only two stars is because their service was awful.  We went on a Sunday night.  They were not busy at all.  In fact, while we were waiting 10 minutes for someone to even acknowledge us, two waitresses were busy rolling silverware into napkins and chatting.  When we were finally able to get someone to wait on us, it was clear this girl had no idea what \"New York style pizza\" even meant.  You'd think if that was the name of your restaurant, you might want to educate your wait staff what, in fact, that meant.  Finally, it took forever to get the check of which she had to be reminded twice.  Remember that they weren't busy.  Had they been, I might be a little more forgiving.

It's a shame that they receive only two stars solely because of poor service.  But in today's world, even with great pizza, good customer service should be the norm, not the exception."}
{"text":"Why would it take 40 minutes to prepare 2 sub sandwiches?  A hot pastrami and a chicken parm were the only two things I ordered and I sat and waited for 40 minutes for these items. If I had not paid upon ordering them I would have not waited around for them. There was a man sitting at the bar that was patiently waiting for about 10 minutes before someone told him they would send someone over to get his order. About 5 minutes later no one had even come by to give him a menu. Really slow service and for just a mediocre sandwich. Probably won't be going back anytime in the foreseeable future."}
{"text":"I understand it's Friday night to start. O.K my kids wanted pizza and I live 5 minutes away ( why didn't you just pick it up? You say ) well I'm tired that's why. I ordered the fingers, 2 pizzas , fries and \" cheesy garlic bread \". First off it took an hour and twenty minutes and cost me 50 bucks! It was late, all the food was like warm and meh. I wish I would have ordered dominoes. It would have been cheaper,faster and warmer. I will never go back. I know I ordered delivery but that shouldn't mean I get lower quality because of it. I ate it cause I paid for it. But all left overs are going in the trash."}
{"text":"I lived in the area when SNY first opened, and was a fan of the pizza.  I have since moved away for a spell and then just recently back to the neighborhood.  I stopped in with my son for a slice of pizza, some cheesy garlic bread, a Greek salad, and a pint of Peroni on draft.  I immediately though, \"Thank goodness this place is just as good, if not better, than I remember!\"  Our waitress, looking familiar from years past, was super nice, and was quick to assess my culinary desires by making a recommendation which was far from regrettable.  That's A+ service!

Nothing better than a nice little neighborhood joint where you can take the family for a pizza night, or just stop in for a slice and a beer to catch a game.

I shall become a regular....again."}
{"text":"Ordered food for my babysitter and kids. Babysitter got pear Gorgonzola salad. She is pretty sure she got food poisoning from the salad. We came home early and I felt terrible. 
Said would take an hour and got food in about an hour."}
{"text":"Great staff. Quality food for the price you pay. We always love the variety that we can get. Pizza is always good!"}
{"text":"Their food is fantastic! I had their meatball sandwich, Cobb salad and the bread with cheese sauce and I was in heaven with everything! Delivery time was about the same for delivery but the guy was super nice."}
{"text":"Our server was great- quick, friendly service; our food was to our table within 10 minutes of ordering. But the food itself I wasn't a huge fan of- the alfredo lacked flavor and the boneless wings were just okay. Will most likely try the pizza next time!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and great service, as always.  Plus, free garlic knots. You can't go wrong here. New menu items and great happy hour prices as well."}
{"text":"The food from here is always good. The reason for two stars is that I had called for a '14 pizza at 5:50pm and they let me know that it would be delivered in 45 min. At 6:55pm, I had to call to find out the status and when the gentleman answered the phone I had told him that I'd called over an hour ago for our order and he let me know that it was on the way. I said \"ok...\", and he just hung up on me. Our doorbell rang another five min later and our pizza was finally here. 

Again, the food is good however there are plenty of other pizza places in town that have much better customer service."}
{"text":"I rarely say this about pizza but the New Yorker is outstanding!! I also had the pleasure of eating a very well crafted Greek salad from this establishment. For starters, everything on this pizza was fresh and filling. Even the crust was hand made. I haven't had a pizza like this in years!! The salad had greens that were \"green\" unlike most where you get the nasty \"core\" pieces. Delicious!! Fresh, fresh, fresh!!! And, wait for it...they deliver!! Only downside is they're a bit pricey but the quality will keep me a customer"}
{"text":"We were not seated immediately, which wasn't great. We were in a hurry. The pizza, as well, literally took 25+ minutes to cook. The waiters had no idea if we had been serviced and the drinks were frequently empty with no one attending the table. By the time we received the pizza, we only had the chance to eat a slice or two each before we boxed it up and got on our way. As for the pizza, it was absolutely delicious. Unfortunately I have to give it a 3 star overall due to the lack of attention we received from our waiters during our visit."}
{"text":"I love this place, the pizza rocks, the best baked Ziti n pizza n town, not to mention the friendliest, coolest employees anywhere. 
Hands down the best Pizza in town. The ppl who work there are awesome!!"}
{"text":"The pizza was delicious, but for pizza, it's overpriced. Also, the cigar smoke from the place next-door makes it unbearable to eat in."}
{"text":"Honestly, I would only leave zero stars if I could. I just had a horrible experience with this location. I first called and while on hold was hung up on. I figured it was an accident so I ordered online to make it easier for delivery. Then an hour goes by no food. I call and they say oh it'll be a few minutes they are on their way. Another 45 minutes goes by. Another phone call where we mention the previous phone call and same story. Finally driver comes. No apologies, nothing. And food is cold, soggy, not edible by any means. We call and get a rude lady on the phone saying they'll give us store credit and refusing to do a refund because they don't have proof I paid with a visa. So I drove down there and suddenly she found the visa in the system however she still can't do a refund until tomorrow? Seriously!???? This was a waste of time. Worst food and customer service ever."}
{"text":"Had an 18\" pizza, which was really good, however, the crust on the base of the pizza was kinda flimsy, so slices are hard to hold. My family had to eat slices with a fork and knife. Service was nice and it wasn't busy for a Friday night, and they always have a game on here. Good place to hang out for groups."}
{"text":"One word. Gross. I am not the pickiest of eaters and even this was way to disgusting for me. The sauce was absolutely horrible. Tasted like it had been in a can for years as it had a tinny taste to it. The toppings are of remarkably poor quality. We waited for delivery for over an hour and a half on a Sunday afternoon. I will never ever order from them again. Do not waste your money. You would do far better even ordering from a chain."}
{"text":"My family was in town for a visit and came to eat here.  We were NOT disappointed!  The garlic bread/rolls were amazing and so was the pizza!  We are pretty picky about pizza and all 4 of us (kids and adults) loved it!  

Someone in our group ordered the broasted chicken and I tried that and loved it, too!  

I live in Southern California and wish you were out here, too!  :-)"}
{"text":"First and last experience with this place. Put a delivery order in and it never showed. After 45 minutes, we call and the guys says, \"the driver just left.\" 45 minutes later we call again and they say, \"oh, you put the order as pick up!\" Are you kidding me? We looked and of couse the confirmation email shows otherwise. We asked,\" why would you tell us it was already in the car?\" No response. Not only that, they state they can't give us a refund because it was through Grub hub. We called Grub hub and they gave us the money back (plus $15) and also confirmed the order was for delivery. Streets of New York obviously serves food with a side of lies."}
{"text":"Very good, crust and sauce just right, closest to a home town San Francisco pizza..  We had the antipasto salad for the Ist time recently and I was sadly disappointed especially based on other reviews.  It is a good salad but a poor antipasto salad, 80-90% lettuce, it should be labeled Italian Salad."}
{"text":"Worth the extra drive on lunch break verse NYPD. Service is friendly and fast. Pizza is so good."}
{"text":"Our waiters name was Orlando. Not only is a credit to himself, but he's a gift to this establishment. I've been eating at the restaurant around 35th ave &Northern for almost 30 years. The food has always been great, the Surprise location is no different. As an Army veteran, it's always a pleasure to find locations that offer a military discount. Although I didn't ask, I was talking to my boys about the service. I was asked if I had a military ID. I displayed it, and received a discount on our meal. 
Take away..  This is a solid restaurant. The food is good and the staff, especially Orlando, is always top knotch."}
{"text":"I brought a group of friends from across town to come try this place because I told them how good the white pizza was, sadly the place wasn't open when there hours said. Oh well Metro Pizza was open."}
{"text":"We've been going her for awhile. Good food and atmosphere.  The owners are very personable and friendly as well...they definitely appreciate their customers."}
{"text":"W O W.... Okay so i have been to this establishment a handful of times, and yesterday was my last time. My wife  had some dental work done earlier in the day and couldn't eat until we got  there. SO THIS WAS THE ONLY FOOD SHE ATE the whole day!! (Just to explain our situation) So not only did the \"manager/waitress\" spill my drink all over my pizza as well as my self WITHOUT an effort to comp ANYTHING or even offer us desert or drinks, which we kind of just laughed of and where disappointed, But then WE BOTH woke up this morning with SEVERE FOOD POISONING!!! We have a 9 month old daughter that had to be picked up because we where in NO condition to take care of her so grandma had to pick her up as well as us TAKING WORK FOR THE DAY OFF with body aches and chills and their food coming out of both ends (please excuse the details)  We had the appetizer combo ad well as just 2 slices of pizza... we still tipped 20% and the response from the same \"manager\" (a young female) when i called was \"we had no other complaints about the food\" ... This is actually the first time i am using YELP because i dont agree with how this \"manager\" handled this situation and think that customers should know what kind of establishment this place is and how they handle such a severe situation. They should be ashamed of themselves!!

By Husband."}
{"text":"Wow, we had some pizza, chicken, potato wedges and I am filled.  It was so good.  The pizza crust was sweet, potatoes were MOJO type.  Reminded me of shakeys.  The chicken was great and not greasy.  Loving it."}
{"text":"Ordered two pizzas for my birthday party last month and both were yummy! One was the white pizza (forget the exact name) and the other was a meat lover's. I personally didn't try the meat one but my friends all liked it quite a bit. Ordered through Yelp; fast delivery."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. The food was decent but the service was exceptionally poor. When we arrived the restaurant was empty but got busier after we were seated. Even though we arrived when they were empty it took almost 10 minutes just for someone to take drink orders. Then another 20 minutes after that before our food order was taken. By the time we got our food we had been there for an hour. We actually watched people who arrived well after us eat, pay and leave before we got any of our food...very frustrating. I don't foresee myself returning..."}
{"text":"I love the pizza here. I guess I am supposed to comment more. However, I will just stick with my original statement that the pizza is great and deserves a four star review based only on the quality/taste of the pizza."}
{"text":"I enjoy their New York combo pizza with a thin crust very much. It is easy to order ahead and pick it up.
They offer a very large menu and have wonderful salads. Haven't tried their pasta dishes yet."}
{"text":"i've only had it as take out...no dine in.

but the cheese pizza is good. The Greek salad is off-the-hook-delicious.

:)"}
{"text":"Good not great! I had high expectations bring a New Yorker and was let down. The restaurant atmosphere was cool but the food was mediocre. The waitress was friendly! The subs are decently sized but nothing special at all. The tomato sauce is terrible (and too sweet) tastes like that Pizza Hut straight from the can stuff. 

The ONLY saving grace was that they serves us HOT garlicky butter rolls before the meal. But I won't be back ... Too many other places that actually put care into the food. The prices are also on the high side for what I would consider basic ideal fair."}
{"text":"Well this is not new york pizza and obviously no one here has ever had NY pizza.  Sauce bland, crust was wrong and cheese had an odd flavor.  Don't say its new york pizza if its not.  Just another sub-standard pizza place trying to make a buck off the new york name."}
{"text":"I got two slice and I was disappointed in the sizes and the taste. They shouldn't call this Streets of NY, cause it's def not. Those two small slices, just cost me $6.50! I'm from NY and that's a lot, usually I got two big slices n large drink and a garlic knot with that price."}
{"text":"I apologize, my previous comment should have been for Streets of New York at 19th ave and Happy Valley."}
{"text":"This place has a super cool name and nice pizza parlor vibe. The service is also great. However, the pizza is not worth the price or calories. It's not very flavorful and does not remind me of New York pizza. We ordered spinach and artichoke dip, pesto mozzarella crostini, and a pizza. The spinach artichoke is not the usual. It's got actual whole pieces of artichoke, which would be great except the artichoke is drenched in oil and completely flavorless. No bueno. The server immediately got us something different when she realized we weren't digging the spinach dip. She recommended pesto mozzarella crostini. That was very good. Really cheesy and fresh. Saved by the server! 

On to the pizza....the reason we are all here. We ordered one half BBQ chicken pizza and one half mediterranean. Both sides were mediocre at best. The pizza was hot and the ingredients fresh-but no flavor and a lot of grease. I would not recommend this place overall for pizza."}
{"text":"I ordered a Caesar salad that was not a Caesar salad. Didn't even have croutons or Caesar dressing. The pizza was awful crust soggy. The service was awful. We witnessed other ppl sending their food back. I order appetizer that never came after 30mins. I just cancelled. I will not eve be back. This place sucks."}
{"text":"I have marked this place as my favorite  south of Grand Ave, North of Bell and east of Litchfield Rd Pizza place.  With all the competition from other Pizzerias, the staff and cooks stand out of the crowd. You can also get Broasted Chicken!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I have been going for years. Could stand to be cleaner. But the food is amazing. Yum!"}
{"text":"Love this place! A group of us (8-10 guys) have tried 3 different SoNY stores. This one really works thanks to Danni. She really knows how to be attentive. We come in every other Thursday and are THRILLED when we see her waiting our table. Hard to believe, but Danni actually remembers our names. Manager is cool/fun too. Great patio when weather permits."}
{"text":"Subpar for the price. The thin crust was super tough and chewy and bbq chicken pizza was pretty sloppy. Wings were okay but not good enough to go back. Pretty bummed after reading the other reviews."}
{"text":"We waited 45 minutes for our food.  The soup was cold and ham and cheese sub just ok.  Should of just left when we walked in and had to wait to be seated...the guy at door to busy on computer to seat us.  Server apologetic but she should of passed it on to kitchen.  Will never return...to many other good restaurants to chose from."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have ordered from this place.  The first time wasn't great... Pizza came barely warm and had way too much cheese, my cookie dessert was slightly burned but the ice cream was still cold and intact.  We also got the Carmel crunch cake, which came freezing cold, hence it was probably frozen to begin with but decent.  Since it was a first time order, I gave them a break.  I ordered the exact same thing tonight and was MAJORLY DISAPPOINTED... My pizza came so cold and had so much cheese on it that when I tried to pull a slice off, the mound of cheese stuck to the other piece and fell completely off... It looked like a congealed cold mess.  The crust is NOT New York style, it's just regular hand tossed.  You can't fold it like New York style pizza should... I thought for sure after the pizza drama that I could count on the cookie... Nope!  The ice cream was completely melted, it was just milky liquid.:(. And again a cold piece of Carmel crunch cake.  This place sucks.  Don't waste your money.  I couldn't even eat the pizza it was so cold and gross... Maybe if my boyfriend was here he could heat it up for breakfast because he will eat anything... More like \"Streets of Domino's Cheap Nasty Pizza\".... Actually I bet Domino's or Pizza Hut would at least deliver a hot pizza.... Get it together folks."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  I wanted bread w my pasta. Was told no. Even when menu says you get w dinner. I would have even paid. Server was just plain bad. Made me feel bad for wanting to look at menu. I almost got up to leave before I got food.  That bad."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Great service. Great food. Salads out of this world. The chicken was delicious. Cannolis pumpkin spice was great. The linguini with pesto fantastic. We will e heading back with the family. Great selection of things on menu. If you love pizza, chicken, salads, soups etc. this is the place."}
{"text":"I would do a 5 stars just for the wings. But the pizza is just ok. The medium wings have a nice sweet zesty flavor with a classic spicy kick that's amazing. Best wings I've had in phoenix."}
{"text":"Ordered from them tonight and while it wasn't the best, it wasn't the worst either. The salad was okay but the chicken was over cooked. The fries were soft and squishy instead of crisp. Dessert was yummy though."}
{"text":"I have ordered from here a few times now and the first two times everything was great and I didn't understand why the reviews were so bad. Well today I now can say they lost a couple stars due to their employee that delivered my food. I get a call saying she's been knocking on my door and \"almost left cause she has other deliveries\", which I totally understand except my tv was extremely low knowing food would be here soon, I have a dog that barks at the slightest noise and there's a doorbell that works right next to the door. So with all these things put together I concluded that she's lying, for what reason I don't know but my food did show up cold. Probably won't bother with this place anymore."}
{"text":"This location has seriously deteriorated since Russ left a month ago.  I overheard three other tables asking why he wasn't helping them.   Hope that the owners reevaluate their service staff, incorporate some changes, and bring Russell back."}
{"text":"The food was ok, I was most impressed with my coleslaw. Very crisp and tasty, possibly the best slaw I have ever had... But that was about it, my cheese steak sandwich was not good at all, the sauce overpowered any other taste that should have been in there. Our server, Cheyenne, was friendly and attentive to our table. Very good service. We might go back, but will definitely stay away from the cheesesteak."}
{"text":"Try the Toscana. I ordered it with pesto (no cream) & it was one of the best pesto dishes I've ever had."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, service was friendly, great little pizza place. Will happily return next time we are in town visiting! 

Really recommend the cheesy passion bread and the white pizza!"}
{"text":"This location is always great. They know what we want to drink when we walk in and for some reason the food is always better at this location. Love the pizza (well done, please), the salads, pasta, everything!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! I'm from out of town and was staying at an RV at Westworld show park. I called about ten minutes before closing praying that they would take pity and manage some last minute food. They totally came through! My mom had a tasty baked ziti while I had the cheese ravioli with marinara sauce. The sause was really flavorful and the ravioli had a good 1/4 inch of fresh, tasty cheese. Best of all was the customer service! Not only could they accommodate us but the delivery guy was friendly and patient! For someone delivering food so late after closing I was really impressed by the customer service and the quality of the food! I will definitely be eating here again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I moved from the East Coast 8 months ago, we had yet to find a good pizza place. Until tonight! We ordered the BBQ chicken pizza with the standard crust and the bone in wings with the hot sauce.  I was pleasantly surprised when the pizza was perfectly cooked and seasoned! The crust was unbelievably buttery and delicious! The wings were different than anything I've ever encountered, and they were to die for! The customer service was great, and the girl I spoke to on the phone was very nice. We will definitely be going here again!"}
{"text":"We've ordered from streets of New York two different times. Once we got a large pepperoni pizza with wings. Pizza was good but the wings were not what we wanted. They seem to be under cooked to where that plays rolls on your mind. Other time we came here was just for cheesecake which was good"}
{"text":"I have eaten in, and done delivery now. So...eating in, pretty darn good. Passion bread is a perk, and the pizzas are great. Wings, not bad. Delivery...something bad happens on the way to the drop site. I think, well my boyfriend and I hypothesize, that since they bake their wings/boneless wings, they aren't as crispy. But maybe, during the drive over, they get even more soggy.  I predict there are better places to get delivery wings on a Sunday Funday football game dinner. But make up your own mind..."}
{"text":"SO I have eaten in here, as well as gotten delivery. When we dine in, the passion bread is a nice complimentary touch, pizza is pretty good, and wings are yummy too. However, something bad happens between the restaurant and delivery. My boyfriend and I hypothesize it has something to do with the fact that they bake their wings, but upon arrival (earlier than predicted even!) the wings/boneless wings are mushy and vinegary...bummer. We ordered delivery out of necessity since it was a Sunday night football kind of day (drinking), and we were a little disappointed. Oh well...make up your mind for yourself."}
{"text":"Terrible pizza, ordered margarita pizza & the toppings slid right off the crust, and the crust was soggy.  Breadsticks tasted like icky too. Won't be coming back!!!

Stay away from this restaurant!!!!!  Wondering if the same owner owns the Street of New York in Ocotillo area, their food is really good, not sure what happened to this one????"}
{"text":"First and last time ordering from this establishment. 
Salad was good, the pizza was horrible. 
We ordered a white pizza thin crust. We usally order from Gus pizza. We just got used to great quality pizza from Gus.
The only reason we tried this establishment is because my wife wanted a salad. 
Hello and goodbye."}
{"text":"Great food and service. My husband and I are regulars,  and we always enjoy our Papago beer on tap!"}
{"text":"Love the food, quality, and cleanliness. The staff Jimmy and Austin were both friendly and helpful and customer oriented. The few times I've been in though the female servers were standing around chatting about their personal things loudly and not tending to tables as quickly as they should, that is what kept me from giving a five star. Otherwise, awesome place to eat."}
{"text":"My husband and I popped in and were blown away. We ordered an appetizer and a pizza and both were amazing with generous portions."}
{"text":"Streets of New York pizza is the freshest slice of pie around, you definitely get what you pay for. My girlfriend and I frequent this establisment at least once a week because of the quality of service they provide, they are always freindly and willing to accommodate any food allergies such as gluten sensitivities. A must go to place for food in the East Valley."}
{"text":"Got carry-out tonight. My pasta dish was dry - not enough sauce. No bread. The dish tasted great - but so dry. The salad was pretty good."}
{"text":"Love Streets of New York! They've got great pizza and great subs and this location has great service. Very cozy, casual, just a great place to grab a bite, a drink and unwind. They have lots of different pizza options, including gluten-free! I happen to enjoy thin crust, which they do offer.

Their wings are pretty good too, and they bring out some delicious galric knots to munch on. Often I'll place an order for a veggie sub, which is toasted, and it's very large and filling.

You can't go wrong :)"}
{"text":"I WAS STARVING! Lucky for me my delivery arrived early, plus the delivery driver had a good personality as he had to wait a couple minute for me to open the door...thank you Streets of New York!"}
{"text":"We are staying a a nearby hotel and have ordered delivery on a three occasions.  We have tried the pizza, cheese steak sandwich and the Italian sandwich.  Each was excellent and the delivery person was prompt, friendly and appreciative of the tip."}
{"text":"I was really in the mood for some wings with my Sam Adams Summer Ale, so I decided to try their hot boneless wings. A full plate of boneless chicken wings came properly sauced, crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside, with red pepper flakes added to the sauce for heat. Quite good with the side of blue cheese dressing and celery strips.

I also decided to try (of all things) the Tuna Salad sub with Pasta Salad as a side. Wow! I've never had tuna salad with dried cranberry in it, but this was very good, especially with an added slice of provolone. It tasted fresh, with a little crunch from celery and red onion, and just a little bit of mayonnaise. The Pasta Salad side was large, creamy, and delicious...penne pasta with bits of bell pepper, olives, provolone, etc. I was impressed with the sub and side, and will definitely order that combination again.

The service was attentive, as usual with this location...tea refilled regularly, and frequent table checks. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Made an order for a large pizza and wings. They said it would be delivered in 45 minutes or less. After an hour I called to make sure I gave the right address. He confirmed and said the delivery girl should be here any second. It's now been over an hour and a half later and I'm still here waiting with 3 very hungry little boys. Hopefully the pizza is really good."}
{"text":"Streets of New York pizza is awful.  Pizza is undercooked.  They are more worried about marking Broasted chicken than a decent pizza. They over charge and their ingredients are sub par. Save your money and don't bother to get food there. Go somewhere else for pizza."}
{"text":"Although my husband and I usually enjoy Streets of New York and we have been to several different locations, this location is not one we will be back to. We tried it a few years ago, and had a bad experience but thought we would check them out again. The cooking is very inconsistent. About a month ago, we had no complaints but this past weekend, our pizza was horrible. IT was under cooked and so was very doughy and limp. The wings were just ok but I did enjoy the antioasto salad. However, my beverage tasted like the lines needed to be cleaned or something. Our waitress was sweet and attentive. As this is the location closest to our house, I would love to support them but instead we will travel to Union Hills and 91 Avenue as we always get delicious pizza there."}
{"text":"I know the food is delicious...who doesn't love a wonderful pizza pie? But the reason they get a five from me is because these guys care about each and every customer...Ted is the most attentive server, making sure we felt welcomed from the first moment we walked in. And the manager, Chris, seems to have all of the employees best interest at heart. Great experience, fast, efficient...check it out!"}
{"text":"You know, I was disappointed with my recent experience.  I ordered delivery so I know there always runs a little risk w freshness, but this was just all kind of \"meh\".  It wasn't BAD, it just wasn't something to rave about.  There were three of us and we wanted to share plates, so we got: spaghetti w meat sauce, an order of meatballs, an antipasto salad, and an order of the golden baked wings, extra crispy. 

The delivery was fast and the food was hot, but it was all just so bland.  My least favorite was the wings; they were VERY fatty and chewy, not extra crispy at all.  We each ate one and threw the rest away, seriously could not eat them.  The spaghetti and salad were okay, both bland but not bad.  I did like the cheesy bread that came w it and I thought the meatballs were good.  

Sorry I didn't get pics; next time.  Overall, perhaps stick w ordering a pizza from this place?"}
{"text":"This Streets of NY location has been in our semi-regular dining rotation for years and has made so many recent improvements that last night we were actually swooning over our dinner.  And we weren't even drinking!  Usually we pay a lot more to swoon over a dinner, and decided at the table that they deserve some serious props.  

This Streets has always been reliable in that we've never, I repeat: Never had to wait for a table, which is gold in a \"winter visitor\" town like Mesa.  (They seem to do a lot of delivery and takeout orders.)  The food has always been reliably good, except for last night when it was outstanding.   This location has an ambiance that feels modern without being cold, comfortably casual, and pleasant to be in.  There are a few t.v.s, in case you're wanting to keep an eye on a game score, but it's not noisy.  
Our servers have been good to great.  (Last night Rachel W. served us and she was awesome.)  

The food:  We usually come in for their thin crust pizza because it's a good tasting crust that gets a bit cracker-ish at the edges and we love the selection of veggies they have.  The artichoke hearts are quartered so you can taste them.  Sun-dried tomatoes aren't dried out or burned.  Plenty of pineapple.  Good cheeses... many meats and sauce choices too.  So we got the pizza... AND the beer cheese because it's maybe my fave beer cheese anywhere.  A little bit zippy, not too salty, just the right consistency, and tons of flavor.  It comes with parmesan bread sticks.  We impulsively also tried two things from their \"Fall Flavors Menu\" which you've really got to check out before it changes.  One item was the Butternut Squash and Pumpkin Ravioli with Sage Cream Sauce and Parsley.  Oh My (Deity)!!    We love squash ravioli and usually find it at Wildflower Bread Co., but frankly this one at Streets was way better!  The squash filling is a little bit sweet and deliciously pumpkiny, and the ravioli was cooked al dente.  The sage cream sauce was delicate and just perfect.  I'm going back very soon for this again.  Lastly, we got the Autumn Harvest Cobb Salad.  It was a beautiful twist on a Cobb salad with sweet potatoes, apples, dried cranberries, chopped candied walnuts, cheddar, celery, and lots of other usual Cobb toppings.  The lettuces were mixed with some iceberg in there, and I'm usually a lettuce snob but you know that it actually was refreshing to not just eat romaine for a change.  We got the maple cider vinaigrette on the side and loved it.

We ate the leftovers today and I'm sad it's all gone."}
{"text":"I had a great experience with the online ordering app.  The pizza margarita was amazing as was the Italian wedding soup!! Fresh ingredients perfectly cooked!! Thanks so much!!"}
{"text":"Pizza tastes and looks just like Little Caesars except it is $17 more.  We kept giving this place a chance because my wife loves the pasta but everything tastes like garbage.  I've ordered the philly, the roast beef and meatball subs and of which were subpar. So I figured I'd try the pizza, after all it should be New York style and how could they screw that up? Well they did and now I'm officially done."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim, without reading reviews. It was pretty dead for a Sunday @ 5pm. Our server was nice, but service was pretty slow. They have fried appetizers, pizzas and subs. We got fries & a 16\" 2 topping pizza. I read some reviews that you got complimentary garlic knots, but we definitely did not. The fries were good... the pizza was OK - the crust was tasteless and reminded me of frozen pizza. I ended up paying near $40 - not worth that price for sure."}
{"text":"It pains me to have to update my review from 2 years ago to a lesser rating. We have visited this place frequently since the review and this last visit had to be shared. The food and service we received this last time we were there was sub-par. I had a slice of pizza and an iced tea. Husband had chicken parm that he asked for without the pasta. My slice was good. Hot and crispy. Everything else was bad. Tea was watered down and tasted like water. Tap, not filtered water which is the nastiest water in America. The chicken parm was cold and came with more pasta than chicken. A little piece of over-breadded chicken that was sitting on a cold pile of pasta (that my husband asked to do without). Waitress seemed new and was trying her best, but it was a disaster.

So I guess if you order a pizza to go you will be safe. As for sitting down, I would avoid it until they fix some issues."}
{"text":"Visited 5/25/12...

I really do like this place for a chain pizza restaurant!!

We were in late night on a pizza and wing craving.Given that we were in 30 minutes before closing, I was really expecting the cooks heart would not be in our order!!  I was wrong!!

Their baked wings were very good. Cooked right and smoothered in Honey Hot.  Pizza was their special with all the toppings.  Fresh and good. 

Wait staff was great. They did not make us feel rushed even whle we sat there 15 minutes after the doors closed. 

5 Stars for this night simply for job well done 30 minutes before closing!!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this spot for years. If not for the great food, for the witty banter. It's like eating at home but without the dog nagging for scraps. 
When they started trivia, our nights got better. Haven't won anything yet- I take that back. I ordered the spaghetti calzone, buffalo wings and a pear salad.
The thing is I always order spaghetti and the other stuff. And they're just as good as the first time I sat down here in 2012. 
The spaghetti inside a calzone- holy edible clam shells, batman! The only thing wrong with this is now I can't make up my mind between this and their bolognese.
The pear salad always fresh, but they must've forgotten I don't care for the blue cheese crumbles. But now I do. They say your taste buds mutate every 7 years and it must be that time, because I love it.
Just not too much, I took the excess and put it in my wings and let's just say I don't think I'm gonna need ranch anymore.
Pasta, wings, trivia. I forgot it was even Monday. 
Thanks streets. Thanks vegas pub quiz. 
Looks like I win again."}
{"text":"As a seasoned cook, and one of a few pizza parlors, I have to say, this place gots the goods.
Although I do wonder why they hide behind a New York subtitle, because it's better than any pie from back east. 
But all I got was a cheese pie. Mainly because the marriage between their pizza sauce and their mozzarella is a heavenly combination. And then when they jump onto  that pizza crust- the devil has to be jealous of that hotness. 
I do notice some subtleties of the dough make up. I do miss the New York-ish like thinness you get from a rolling pin. I can totally tell they're handling it completely by hand to tossing it. You can tell because it has a flaky like crispness reminiscent of Sicilian pies. It looks thicker but it's airy; no way like the travesty Chicago pies end up being. 
Either way, and whoever ends up making my pie, the sauce is delicious, the cheese is delicious, and these are the only slices where the crust disappears too."}
{"text":"I have dined at Streets of New York for years with a whole spectrum of experiences. Today was exceptional in the area of delivery & food quality! I ordered a \"Cold' # 7 - The Best of Everything (and it is) and some fries. It came as fresh as it gets and the fries were still crispy upon arrival! The delivery driver was pleasant, well dressed and professional! A great representative for the company! Keep up the good work over there on Carefree Highway!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing pizza and the shock top that they have on tap is sooooooo much better than what you'd get in a bottle. We got their house special new york combo pizza and a side of fries. Everything was perfect."}
{"text":"Pizza was disgusting. I stopped in for a take out order on my way home (I literally live 3 mins away) when I got home and lifted my slices out of the box they were a soggy mess of cheese, sauce and wet dough!  A well done slice of pizza should stand firm when folded in half and be easily eaten one handed.  NOT a soggy mess that limps over like a sad ice cream cone.  Needled to say I will not be back."}
{"text":"Ugh AMAZING!!! No words can describe how delicious this place is! I order hot wings and pizza and they never fail :) my server is always nice too! I need to get her name next time! (Black hair a little older) she was great! Thanks SNY!"}
{"text":"Not genuine NY pizza but still tasty. I'm from NY and the crust and style of the pizza was certainly not authentic NY style; however, it was still tasty and I'd go there again. The Broasters chicken is excellent, possibly the best fried chicken I've had. Service was very friendly and prices are fair. The chocolate cake dessert was very rich with strong dark chocolate flavor, which I loved. The appetizers we had (deep fried onion rings, cheese sticks, zucchini spears, and French fries) were ok but nothing special. The passion bread is tasty. The chicken Parmesan is average. The marinara sauce is too heavy on the oregano and you can tell when having it with the chicken parm and pasta but on the pizza you can't tell."}
{"text":"Buy at your own risk!!! I paid for my food in the amount of $57 last night. I showed up to pick up my food at 7:15. I was told to park and come on in. When I came in, I thought it was only going to take a few minutes because my food was expected to be done at 7:15. At 7:30, they asked if I wanted a drink. I said no thank you and continued to wait. At 7:45 I requested to speak to a manager. The staff told the manager that I want to speak to her, and she just looked at me and ignored me for another five minutes. When she finally approached me she asks what is going on? I told her that I would like my food. She said that it is taking some time. When I asked for my money back she agreed and went in the back. She then comes back and tells me that she couldn't give me my money back because I paid online. I explained that I had three hungry kids at home and I need to go somewhere else. She gave me attitude. I cussed once and she yells at me over speaking that way to her. I finally left the restaurant with COLD food at 8:00. I will never buy food there again!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in across the street but was told in would be 25-30 minute wait.  Out!  We had been a SONY, a while back and could not remember anything negative about the experience.  So the GF and I bounced across the street.  I love the layout and location of the area!

Seat yourself on a busy early night on a Saturday.  Possibly formidable but not a problem on this particular evening.  Some crumbs on the table selected but easily whipped away, we sat.

Our server was happy. happy, joy, joy despite (appearing) being up to her ears in customers.  She was all smiles and so was the other younger dudes who came in to assist.

My Coke was never empty and neither was the GF's Iced Tea.  We started with carbs..Passion Bread.  Bits of dough slavered with buttery garlic and parmesan.  Carbolishes!

The GF ordered up the \"make you own pasta.\"  The sauce was tasty and she added pepperoni to the mix.  I believe the call it \"Angles with dirty faces.\"  There were no issues with her requests.

I settled on Ultimate New York Cheese Steak. The roast bead was thin and awesome.  The onions and mushroom made it pop!  The Alfredo/Provolone sauce was awesome.

After consuming we could not eat another bite and SONY was added to list of returns."}
{"text":"Will do take out next time.  Their servers are very rude, and on top of that expect a tip.  Millenials, I swear.... or in this case 'Adriana'"}
{"text":"The antipasto salad was delicious and the cheesy bread with the marina dipping sauce was a nice addition which more than filled me."}
{"text":"This is one of the only places I've ever been to that sells boasted Chicken and you need this in your life so good you will Crave it once a week if not more lol some of the best fried chicken you will ever eat.

{"text":"The baked ziti was possibly the biggest waste of caloric intake ever... Boo, this place is a waste of time"}
{"text":"Great pizza that is very affordable and they deliver!

Being from Chicago I was hesitant to try New York style pizza again. When I visited the Big Apple all the pizza I had was complete garbage, but Streets of New York has the right stuff. They have a great variety of menu options that could please any pizza lover. Streets of New York just jumped up to the top of my go-to list of places I will order in for pizza. I have been riding the pizza struggle bus ever since I moved out to Phoenix a year and half ago. Until now I had only found solace in very high end pizza restaurants. 

This evening we ordered a thin crust pepperoni pizza and the \"Flagship Pizza\". Both pizzas were great! Streets of New York uses really fresh ingredients to make their pizzas that are quality and it is reflected in the taste of the pizza.

I will definitely be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Ok first of all, 
Taking the first bite of my artichoke dip.. Crunch.. There was a large piece of hard plastic wrap in my dip! 
Secondly, 
My waitress couldn't even read her own handwriting and had to make us reorder!  
Thirds the charm, 
The pizza was all dough, no sauce, no flavor & the salad was the meaning of mediocracy due to lack of properly chopping the lettuce. Everybody in my family received their orders at different times. The  last meal arrived a little over an hour after being there. And we were the only ones there.  This place puts pizza to shame!

P.s. Waitress, you shouldn't throw the help under the bus because you didn't know you had a table.   I was debating on leaving you a tip your bus boy did ALL the work"}
{"text":"I ordered my food through \"Eat\" at 8:00 pm and the food wasn't delivered until 9:10 pm.  I left 2 instructions in the notes section when I placed my order 1. Please deliver to the front door, not the garage and 2. Please bring us extra ranch dressing for the wings, fingers, fries and other fried food. At 9:10, my 6 year old came screaming across the house that someone was trying to break in through the garage because someone was pounding on the garage door. Yes...the delivery driver was too lazy to walk to the front door. And instead of extra ranch dressing, they gave us no ranch dressing. To make matters worse, all of our food was cold. Not warm...but cold!! And my daughter's chicken fingers are burnt. I never give bad reviews but the only thing edible is the cheesecake. I am extremely disappointed, am hungry and out $44.00."}
{"text":"Alright - because the pizza was good I'll bump the rating.  But please train people to ask about the desired cut of the pizza regardless of the thickness of the crust.  Getting the pizza home only find that it's been purposely demolished was a real let down.  

The person taking the order could issue a warning something like \"we can cut this normally like you'd get on the streets of NY, or we can destroy it into unmanageable squares with hot cheese and sauce oozing off of it on all four sides\" would be perfect.  

All parties -- aware and in the loop."}

Came on a Sunday afternoon and it was pretty empty.  Waiters were very friendly and everything was so delicious!"}

Good food at very reasonable prices.
The pizza was very good!
The owner was on site and very involved in all aspects.
Overall a very nice unexpected experience."}

{"text":"Food isn't good. Service isn't good. Really wanted to like it, but it's just a waste of money and time.

Edit: Hi Rick, I appreciate your desire for a resolution. Not sure what to do there, I've had bad food multiple times there, and haven't been happy once. 

At other locations for Streets of New York I've had a significantly better experience."}
{"text":"Not exactly a NY slice...

Pizza tastes great, all herbs and spices are there, its a solid slice, especially in the area where good pizza is hard to come by.

Im from the tri state so I would like to think my opinion is a valued one.

Only clear dislike is the crust on the bottom of the pie is quite soft."}
{"text":"This place was great! We came in on a monday and it was trivia night! 6 rounds of fun with the fam. We got a pizza and a salad, it was all delicious. Great service and fast too!"}
{"text":"Really good pizza with good pricing. Wish their delivery started a little earlier in the day, though."}
{"text":"Streets is our pizza place. Hands down it's the best pizza in the area. Search no further this is an all around winner. Service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see."}
{"text":"We love Streets of New York. They have great pizza and their fries are amazing. Always have great service."}
{"text":"So...been to SONY many times for dine-in...they get an F on the whole delivery concept. My first delivery was bad, chewy raw pizza...they gave me a $10 credit for that. The 2nd (and, last) time the pizza was more well done, but cold because it took the driver an hour and 20min to get here. The minestrone soup tastes like it comes from a can...disappointing because  we don't have too many spots that deliver in N. Phx beyond Dominos etc....no more SONY for me."}
{"text":"Rude, worst experience ever.

Similar to another reviewers experience, we ordered and waited 1.5 hours after the promised delivery time before we saw our food.  The manager promised that he wouldn't charge us for our food, but my card was still charged.  Rude, and a liar.

When the food arrived, the driver was upset when I decided not to tip him.  The food was cold, and inedible. 

This location will never get our business again."}
{"text":"Sat down and immediately got service. Food and staff never missed a beat. Fresh fantastic food. A must go"}
{"text":"We love their thin crust pizza and are sad the location on Gilbert and Germann closed!"}
{"text":"Customer service was good and I was well attended to BUT...
This food is highly disappointing...the boneless chicken wings were undercooked and soggy from sauce, the fries were still frozen tasting and the celery and carrots were super old. Pizza was ok..nothing special and not worth price charged. We spent over $75 for a family meal and threw over half of it away. I should have paid attention to the fact that the resturant was empty. Unfortunately didn't feel comfortable going back for a refund. Hopefully they'll work on quality over quantity."}
{"text":"The food wasn't very good. We used a groupon. If we wouldn't have had that it would have been way too overpriced. If you're looking for good pizza head over to mr Jims down the street. This pizza didn't have much flavor and was very expensive!"}
{"text":"Came in at lunch time and place was pretty busy.  Seated right away, service was good, pizza and salad we ordered were tasty.  Good place to go for an inexpensive and quick  meal."}
{"text":"The flagship pizza is delicious! It was loaded with meat and didn't bend when you picked it up. We got it with a traditional crust and it was crispy on the outside and not dry in the middle. Food was fast and great service. The artichoke dip had big chunks of artichoke and was tasty on the little toasted bread that came with it. the pastrami sandwich is delicious and the sesame roll they use is the best part if  you ask me..I would definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"We had good service for a small joint and on a busy night I liked it. With the nice weather it's a great time to sit outside too!"}
{"text":"Vegas is the worst place to find pizza if your really looking. I can only name two place in all of Vegas who actually have good NEW York tasting pizza and this was one place that has amazing pizza!!! I wish it were more servers for the amount of ppl that was in there though our waiter was really nice. But that's the only bad thing I have to say."}
{"text":"Poor service waitress didn't know what it was when I asked for the complimentary pizza bread bites. They call it passion bread now and she still never brought it out once she figured it out. She didn't say the plate was extremely got and I almost dropped it all over me when I picked it up to move it. She didn't even ask if we needed anything and we are right across from the counter. It was as if she hated waiting on people and was in a bad mood."}
{"text":"I am always befuddled and perplexed when my review of a certain establishment is so much better or so much worse than the other reviews that my fellow Yelpers have posted, but in regards to Streets of New York I am compelled to tell all of my fellow Yelpers who posted reviews with anything less than four or five stars that with all due respect, you need to lay off of whatever type of intoxicant you are drinking and / or smoking because your judgement has been seriously impaired!!!!! 

Now having said that, I will say that there have been times during one of my many visits when the service has been, how shall I say it, less than stellar. No worries, anybody who has read one of my reviews before knows that I could care less about the service at a food establishment if the food is good, and at the Streets of New York, the food is EXQUISITE!!!

Streets of New York is the real deal, everything is fresh with such a unique taste. 

This is not one of those, \"insert generic pizza / pasta place name here\" type of places, no this is the real deal, if you are looking for a pizza place where everybody will be really, really nice to you, and fill your drink thirty six times, and draw a smiley face on your check go to pizza hut, if you want damn good food this is the place for you.

When you arrive you will notice the line, I guess that everybody who goes out to eat does not post reviews on Yelp, who knew, or should I say, how weird!?!?!? Some people, and based on the line or wait time at Streets of New York, I would have to say many people, just vote with their wallets.

When you get seated greet your server, I have always found not being a jerk helps improve the service, than order either the Baked Chicken Wings or the Chopped Antipasto Salad, NO WAIT, order both, you will regret it later if you don't.

I love chicken wings and these are great chicken wings, they will dress them in a sauce if you so request but in my ever so humble opinion the sauce just takes away from the taste of what may be one of the top ten best chicken wings in the United States.

Now the antipasto salad, I am a meat guy, I am all about the meat, so when I fell head over heals in love with this salad I thought we would have to rush my wife and best friend of twenty seven years to the hospital, thank God, false alarm. I do not have an adequate vocabulary to properly describe this salad so let me just say that it may be one of the tastiest, most mouth watering things I have ever ordered at a restaurant ............................. the antipasto salad is to die for!!!!!

So after you have completed savoring the delectable wings and the tantalizing antipasto salad as your appetizers, what can I say, I am a big eater, time to move on to the main course.

My wife is a fan of the Old World Meatball sub on the wheat bread, just a warning, this is a popular item and they often run out of the wheat bread.

Me, I am all about the pizza and the pizza here is very good, it is not my favorite pizza in the world, but as pizza goes, it is pretty damn good.

I could go on and on as I really enjoy this place if you have not already picked up on that but I have typed all that I care to type and it is time to close.

Go to Streets of New York and enjoy the food, if the service is less than awesome, shake it off like a big boy (or big girl) and remind yourself that you came for the food, not for counseling!!!!!!

Until next time my fellow Yelpers ............... Be Local, Live Local, and whenever you can ................. Buy Local!!!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible! Paid 26 dollars for their New York combo(flagship pizza). This is nothing short of a high price frozen pizza. The crust was too thick and doughy and the meat was tasteless. This pizza couldn't compare to the worst pizza in New York! If you want excellent New York style pizza go to New York Pasta and Pizza 2400 South Jones Blvd. 702 871 1159. Call and ask if Anthony is making the pizza he is simply the best pizza chef in Las Vegas. Take it from this Native New Yorker who eats a lot of pizza daily. The Streets of New York tastes like the \"Streets of New York\" pure crap!"}
{"text":"Average pizza. Wayyyyyyyy over priced.  17 bucks for cheese pizza.  Give me a break.  And the taste. AVERAGE.  Save your money go some place else.

I would take a Costco pizza over this place.  LOL"}
{"text":"Eating in is a decent experience, but for delivery, I have yet to meet their match.  When I order delivery I always get a 16\" chicken pizza with alfredo sauce on top, and for the last 6 years I have received it in 30 minutes or less all but 2 times.  Its always tasty, fresh, and is my preeminent food for delivery, ever, period."}
{"text":"I consider this to be average pizza. Crust ok. Didn't have enough sauce or it wasn't that flavorful. We got mushroom, sausage, and pepperoni pizza which was pretty greasy. Extra large for $23. Not the best I've had, but not the worst either."}
{"text":"Subpar food. The waitress was aggravated every time we asked for anything. I will not come here again. Frozen pizzas have better flavor than this food."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery at 515 on Monday during Monday Night Football so I figured it would be a while. They said it would be 1 hr, 615 delivery. That's fair- MNF and all. I called at 640 and they said it would be delivered in 5 minutes. At 700 they finally show. 45 minutes late. Not even a call from management to apologize. Really? Next time I'll order from Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"As a chain pizzeria, the quality you expect at this Streets of New York should be the same as every other location. However, from my experiences, I hope that isn't the case.

There's a decent selection of food here - appetizers, pizza, pasta, wings, sandwiches, desserts, and a beer and wine menu. Prices are alright, and there are lunch specials for those wanting to save a little money.

Service here is VERY inconsistent. I've only been served bread two out of five times. Of the three, we asked for bread as every other table got it. Our waitress said yes, and she asked us if we still wanted our bread, AFTER our pizza appetizers, OVER AN HOUR later.

Another instance, service was great on a busy weekday lunch. Bread was brought without asking, and she constantly came back to for refills (we didn't get any last time!). Interestingly enough, this is the same server.

Perhaps the place is understaffed, but it doesn't seem that big to me. Because this place cannot even give me a consistent view of its quality, I haven't come back in almost a year."}
{"text":"Great new York style pizza!!! Quality ingredients, fast delivery. We will definitely be eating here again"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service, awesome happy hour beer specials. Had the calzone, huge portion. Definitely suggest giving them a shot :)"}
{"text":"I ate here many times, but today I discovered GLASS, yes GLASS shards in my drink. I notified the staff immediately to which they responded they will cover my drink and my kids. I stated I am not paying for this meal, eventually the manager had to call to make sure it was ok to cover the cost of the meal. I cannot believe this... my main point for writing this is to document the fact that I was dismissed and looked at simply as a dollar sign and not a human being. My fear is that I did swallow a shard of glass and could be seriously hurt. I'm never eating here again, if you do check your food and drinks for your own safety. I know I will check every time from now on, I cannot believe this actually happened. No, I'm not a disgruntled customer. Please be careful.

5/26/18
Rick,
No one contacted me other than your post. There is no ticket, I did not pay for the meal. I'm not sure what could be done to fix it other than to check your equipment and properly train your staff. As for me as a customer, you have done nothing to rectify the situation."}
{"text":"Honestly, this is the the most disappointment choice for dinner I have ever made. 

This is NOT NY pizza.  You can't even fold it! 

It is 1/2 the size but thick. There is no characteristic of NY pizza with this company. 

- No folding
- thick mushy dough
- no grease dripping
- small

And corporate knows it! 

The staff recognized that the east coast corporate  is psyching out the west coast gullibles..... but when an east coaster tries what they think is NY pizza, it is not worth the money."}
{"text":"The broasted chicken is amazing, delicious and habit forming.  Went there on Wednesday night and had to return on Saturday for this chicken.  Sterling was very friendly and served out food hot and quick.  The chicken is a must have for people who like crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  You will not be disappointed.  I would like to try their pizza but I just can't get past the chicken."}
{"text":"Bland, bland, bland. Did I mention that the pizza was bland? It's also overpriced for what you get in my opinion. I've had pizza on the actual streets of New York, it was more affordable & much better tasting for sure.

With so much good pizza in the phoenix area, there is just no excuse for going to streets of New York. If you insist on bland pizza, go for the cheap stuff & call one of the big chains.

I love to support local businesses, but they have to come through on product & price. Sadly, I don't feel that Streets of New York does that at all."}
{"text":"Staff is welcoming. New thin and crispy pizza is really good. Reasonably priced wine.  Great value for the money."}
{"text":"Service: Daniel and the servers and are short staffed. Service was good but pretty slow night for them. They work hard and they care. Could be cleaner.

Food: Disappointed in the pizza tasted good but very greasy. The salad was fresh, no problem there. 

I think they need to improve food standards and they can do well from there.."}
{"text":"I placed a phone in delivery order and was told 45 minutes!  After an hour and fifteen minutes I called and the guy said oh yours is the first ticket, I'm just waiting on my driver to return!  By this time I was really pissed and told myself there's no way in hell I'm paying for what is going to arrive!  When the driver did finally arrive I said that needs to be complimentary since it took an hour and 45 minutes and there's no way it's close to being fresh! I gave the kid a big tip which i now regret because my hard rock sandwich and pizza that had sat for no telling how long wasn't even remotely edible and ended up in the trash!  That's three times now that this particular location has screwed up in a big way!  Never Again!!!  The problem is not Streets of NY per se, it's this particular location!  If you're short a driver, send someone else or hey Mister Mgr deliver yourself.  Learn to under promise and over delivery instead of doing the exact opposite of that!"}
{"text":"We went to have a little snack for lunch yesterday and ordered the boneless chicken wings.  They were absolutely horrible... More breading than meat,  the meat... If there was any.... Was dry,  the nuggets were hard and overall bad.  It was a complete waste of money.  However, the service was great,  very friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Awful!!! Do yourself a favor and avoid this location at all cost. Since I've not had a bad experience at SONY and this was my first time ordering from this location, I thought the star rating was an anomaly. NOPE!! Didn't get everything I asked for and it was Luke warm at best. No wonder only 2.5 stars. $38 for 
A small pizza (loaded with zucchini which I asked to be removed), a beef sub which was dry and flavorless and the garlic cheese bread without the marinara sauce I asked for. It's not rocket science folks...just read the customers direction. Simply disgusting!! AVOID!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have rarely met a pizza that I didn't like. And after reading reviews on AZCentral, and this being close to home, I figured this would be the place. 

I was seriously disappointed. I don't know if I just ordered the wrong thing, but this was pretty unimpressive. So much so that, even with it being one of the closest to home, we will never eat there again. 

Sorry guys!"}
{"text":"The pizza wasn't really New York style but it wasn't terrible either. The house salad was pretty good. The service wasn't anything spectacular. This place was pretty average."}
{"text":"If you are craving pizza that tastes like it as actually from New York forget this place. Not even close. It should be considered false advertising to include \"New York\" in your name. It implies the food is similar to food you would find there. This place would not last a week if it was in New York. That should tell you something!"}
{"text":"Worst services.  Sat for 15 minutes before we received our menus. Waited 10 minutes still didn't have our drinks and never took our order. We left told them it was because of their lack of service.   They acted like they could careless."}
{"text":"This SNY seems smaller than most to me, and maybe that's what seems to make it better. The service here is always top notch. I honestly don't know how they do it, because it consistently only looks like 2 people are working! The guys at the front serve, answer the phone, do takeout and cashiering! They are super high energy and always seem to be in a positive mood. The cook(s) do seem to take pride in the food they put out. It can be a little slow at times, but I find it well worth it! It's not some lukewarm, been sitting around slice of pizza.
The food here is really good. They have huge side salads, awesome pizza (giant slices), and free breadsticks when you dine in. It can be a bit costly if you don't order from the list of specials. Keep an eye out for those and they often have coupons as well. If you call for delivery, be forewarned it's usually at least an hour until arrival, but again, worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Super yummy & the staff is great! I definitely recommend this place. Service was fast & the food looks absolutely delicious. I'll be ordering the cookie with ice cream for dessert. The place is not too busy so my server is super attentive & my meal got out in good time."}
{"text":"You frickin' guys... uggh. I was disappointed to say the least. Delivery times made me so hungry that I had to eat it. It got here in just enough time to make sure it was almost lukewarm.  Had the Napolitana with penne. Tasted like it was straight from a can, also had minestrone, and it was the saltiest thing since the dead sea... Not getting my vote for a second chance, maybe for pizza because that's sorta hard to screw up. I think their hearts are in the wrong place in this business..."}
{"text":"I was excited to see they opened one up right by my house.   My favorite spot for Pizza.   Prices are great and the service staff is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Amazing Pizza!  Even Better is the Chicken!   We love Stacey and Crew!  We are regulars during the week for lunch, and it is seemless, timely and fun!"}
{"text":"As someone on a gluten-free diet, I was very excited to hear that Streets of New York is offering gluten-free pizza crust. If you have ever had Amy's or any other common g/f rice crust pizza, I would say stick with that.

The gluten free pizza was upwards of $12 before toppings, and each additional topping was a ridiculous $2+. I'm sorry, but toppings don't cost that much even in Vegas and Disney World (two expensive places I've been to recently).

I do not recommend this restaurant one iota if you are going for the g/f pizza. The frozen pizza from Fry's natural food section is just as good if not better, because it's considerably cheaper and you can buy your own toppings for the cost of just one at this restaurant."}
{"text":"We ordered a thin crust pizza however they delivered a regular crust pizza. The pizza cost $33. We called to complain, they said they would deliver a new pizza but were still going to charge us for it! Their thin crust pizza tastes so much better than their regular one. It's much more expensive than other pizza but would have been worth it if they would have gotten our order right or be  willing to replace it. Who does that?! Terrible customer service. So disappointed."}
{"text":"Their broasted chicken is yumm!! My husband loves fried chicken but I always find it to be too greasy. This is our compromise. I love Pizza, and this place sells it. Ive eaten here once and the customer service is good. Ive carried out the rest of the times and service varies. One time they forgot to make my order and I had to wait for that, that was not a good day. Their pizza is okay. Their cannoli are crazy sweet. Too sweet for me and I like me a good cannoli. I recommend this place. I always have the chicken and pizza meal. I enjoy it, my kids enjoy it, and my husband enjoys it. Good family place. Its never too busy so I enjoy that too."}
{"text":"They added broasted chicken to their menu... I love me some broasted chicken, so in I went to investigate.

I do not love me THEIR broasted chicken.

To me it tasted rubbery and had a strange odor, and it was so salty that an hour later I could still taste it. I ordered a few pieces and I ate part of one and then bolted.

I can't speak to anything else on the menu. Their garlic knots, for what it's worth, were fine."}
{"text":"We love this Streets Of New York however I feel the need to warn all customers to be careful coming in from the West entrance.  Our family was almost run over by one of the delivery drivers in a Silver Jeep who came flying into the parking lot to quickly and with no regard for others.  I had to stop my husband from confronting him. 

Come dine here, food is great, staff is great just watch out for the delivery driver in the Silver Jeep."}
{"text":"Walked in at 6pm, 5 of 20 tables had clients, including us. One of the 5 tables had food. Got our drinks then waited 55 minutes for our food. At the 45 minute mark a second waitress came over and asked if we wanted refills. Five minutes later bread sticks came. Pizza was good, service and cook staff very poor."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Best new York style pizza I've had in az. Definitely will be coming back and the wings are baked so their healthier then most places. Definitely suggest going there. Great food and service."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would.  No problem with ordering. Delivery guy was within 45 min.  Two large pizzas, an appetizer, & the tip = $70! Outrageous for the quality of food. One pizza was burnt in the bottom. The other literally had a can of cold diced tomatoes on top (they called that a margarita pizza!).  Super greasy.  Made us sick for DAYS after.  You couldn't pay me to eat anything from this place again. Hands down the WORST pizza we've ever had."}
{"text":"I had one of the best Philly Cheesecake sands I've ever had. Delivery was right on time, courteous. Love this place. Would order again."}
{"text":"This place is a disappointment!! We have continually tried to order from this place and have given them chance after chance. Today was the straw that broke the camels back. My husband and I ordered two pizza's for delivery.  A four cheese and a make your own pizza with a couple veggie toppings. When the pizza's arrived the cheese pizza looked like they stored the box on its side on the way here. We decided lets make the best of it and tried to redistribute the cheese. When we went to pull a slice on both pizza's the cheese was 1/2 inch thick and was like a brick. Underneath the pizza dough was BARELY cooked and was unable to withstand the weight of itself let alone the heaping amount of cheese they haphazardly thrown on. When we bit into it we confirmed that the pizza was under-cooked. We have to wait for 45-55 minutes for delivery which to me means they are taking the time to cook the pizza but apparently not. We have experienced these same issues before with streets and put up with it due to the limited restaurants that deliver in our area. My husband is currently returning the remaining pizza to the restaurant, I should have pulled the slices we couldn't stomach out of the trash and send that back with it. For their higher prices this should be the best dang pizza in the area. Unfortunately, Domino's puts out a way better $5 pizza, which isn't saying much. These folks need to get there act together and stop treating there food with no care. It makes me wonder, do they not care due to the lack of options in our area so they feel they can do whatever they want? Well we will not be taken advantage of any longer. Adios Streets of New York, I will now happily suit up and drive the 12 miles and spend our hard earned money at Oregano's or Barro's, where they will provide us with a fully cooked pizza.

*Update..... my husband has come home and told me they stated \"We have been having problems in the kitchen all day\". WHAT!?!? How is that acceptable? If you have been having issues ALL day then, as any good business management would do, it should be fixed by now. If you cant fix it stop selling that product. If its your staff, give them the training and hold them accountable. If they cant do the job get someone who can in place.This should be a business dedicated to its customer satisfaction,  and being a supervisor myself, i wouldn't expect anything less than the best of my product and my team. As i said earlier in my review that this has happened before (more times than not) and per other reviews I see its a consistent message. Don't give a line of bull, own your problems and fix them. Also when they refunded the $47 dollars we spent on two medium pizza's (CRAZY PRICE, I KNOW), she I feel didn't know how to properly refund. She as a manager advised my husband that she doesn't use that machine much so doesn't know how to operate it. So, there multiple subtractions and additions on a receipt of 4,700.00 (WHAT!?!?!) then multiple subtractions and additions of other amounts. Now i have to watch my bank account like a hawk to ensure its not screwed up. WHAT A HASSLE!!"}
{"text":"Mehhhh.

I wanted to like this place more. 

I came in for lunch with a Groupon. Started with the artichoke spinach dip and it wasn't great. The dip was flavourless until I dumped a boat load of pepper on it. The bread they brought to dip in it was so hard it almost broke my teeth.

The house salad was good but I can make a salad at home.

The pizza was New York style think crust. Could've used more sauce and cheese but it was decent for what I paid.

My favourite thing was the pasta dish I got. It had sundried tomatoes, fresh mozerella, and garlic chicken. It was bomb!!!

Server was decent. She seemed a little peeved when I said I had a coupon. Oh well, still tipped on the full amount. 

Probably won't be back unless it's to try their happy hour which was really cheap!"}
{"text":"My first time experiencing this place.... I called in a order for pick up. The girl on the phone sounded pleasant, took my order and told me it would be ready for pick-up in 15 min. I arrived 10 min later to see what the place looked like. Has a nice atmosphere. Unfortunately this is where it goes down hill. I ordered the garlic cheese bread and the baked ziti. I ended up waiting over 40 min for the food to be ready. I watched as the lady who I assume was a manager went back and yelled at the cook for 10 min, who apparently forgot to cook my order. The cook apologized but was met with a resounding amount of scorn, \"you better be sorry.\" 

So, now to the food. I have to say that I wouldn't be so upset if it was worth the wait. The baked ziti was bland and disappointing. It didn't have much italian sausage in it at all and the garlic cheese bread should just be called mozzarella cheese bread. The garlic was non-existent. 

Overall I wont be going back to this place and dont r"}
{"text":"I loved this place and miss it greatly since I moved back to Nebraska. The Clockwork Pizza, spicy chicken wrap, the wings, I have not found anything here to match the quality other service."}
{"text":"The Streets Of New York on Camelback is fantastic! So we decided to order online with delivery. Our pizza was delivered, the delivery driver was funny, chatty. We go to eat our pizza and it is cold. Not warm, not cooling off, COLD. I call an the manager Corey tells me that our Pizza sat in the back for awhile before the delivery driver (who turned out to Ron the owner) delivered it to us. I paid $38.00 after tip for a cold pizza........."}
{"text":"New manager has done a pretty good job at this location. Used to have issues with our order almost every time so we stopped going for awhile. However over the last couple of months they have been great."}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots.  They have some of the best subs in the area.  The \"Italian Stallion\" is easily the best Italian sausage sandwich in town.  Their hot wings are also very good.  I'm not sure what flavoring their \"hot\" uses, but it doesn't seem to be traditional Buffalo-style (which seems a little weird for a place with \"New York\" in its name), but still tasty.  (I'd love to see Buffalo-style as an option, though!).  Their broaster chicken beats any fried chicken as well."}
{"text":"They served me bad wine and didn't offer any compensation - even after my request to the server. -2 stars for that blunder (it happens, but there's always some 'I'm sorry' gesture).  Pleasant casual venue; pizza, chicken Parmesan, and calzone were all good, and pricey for a 'pizza joint' in my opinion. Service was as expected but nothing more. -1 star. I expect to wait a bit for a good restaurant on a Saturday night, but there was no wait. 

Note to restaurant - Your ad monitor requests Yelp reviews, so you got it."}
{"text":"If you are in the Centennial Hills area you cannot go wrong eating at the Streets of New York. They are located right off the 95N & Durango exit and a right turn on Farm and then the 2nd right turn and you have arrived to one of the Best Pizza's in the Hills.
Again we were taken care of by the Great Staff with Margie who served us tonite and Brittany. All of the staff are so good that no-matter who waits on you things will go well. We are there about every 2 weeks or so & they take such good care of us that we keep going back. You will be delighted at the Great Food that is served there. Along with the Super Pizza they serve they have the Best Antipasto for two and that is served with Garlic knots and they are fantastic too. Really anything that you order you will be happy with it. Robin does a fine job running this restaurant and making sure everything is good for the customers.
If your in the area and you are hungry do yourself a favor and stop in for a great meal no matter if its pizza or a sangwich or just a salad you will make it a point to go back again. If Margie or Brittany take care of you tell them Robbie said Hi. lol"}
{"text":"Nooo. Was so excited to recieve our order and it was well below average.  The pizza has no flavor to it and the sandwiches are ok but ehh still. Lastly the beer battered combination was what I was looking forward to and yeah again no flavor and the batter came off very easily. Disappointed.."}
{"text":"Long story short not impressed with this location manager/owner. Tried to put in large takeout order ($80 bucks worth) looking to get a couple of pizza & wings specials and another GF pizza. Was told by mgr that only one special per takeout order, huh? Not using multiple coupons, I just wanted to order 2 of the pizza & wings specials - nope not allowed!

So, do I place one order & call back for a second? They were willing to let $80 go for some unwritten policy? I've ordered a lot of pizza over a lifetime and never had this issue.

Now, in their defense I was given a discount on the wings and overall it probably cost me an extra 3-4 bucks but, the whole conversation, on-hold, get a mgr, are you looking at our website, it doesn't say you can't order multiples, back n forth was ridiculous.

Yes pizza was pretty good - wings too! Gal taking my order was great. Another employee brings my food - very nice and helpful. But...it was more a pain then it was worth. I'll take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"It's a little pricey for neighborhood pizza, but I like the food.  The wings are better than average and the pizza dough is great as bread and crust.  The service is not rushed, ask for the check early if you are in a hurry.  The menu is fairly extensive so you can satisfy a  group with different tastes."}
{"text":"Not only did it take an hour and twenty minutes to receive a pasta order but the food came cold. Normally I wouldn't be concerned with the long delivery time if the food was good but overall completely dissatisfied."}
{"text":"Well, ordered pizza with black olives and pineapple. Came with black olives and pepperoni. Since I am a vegetarian that won't work. The salad was OK and cheesecake ok. Nothing special. Very sad excuse for a Streets of NY."}
{"text":"The rating would have been higher except for the mediocre service.  I went during lunch and ordered the $6.25 slice of pizza and bowl of soup combo.   Instead I got charged separately for pizza and soup at more than $9.  The soup was OK, kind of thin but tasty.  The pizza was very good and was a large slice.   It took a long time for the pizza to show up, but the soup was brought quickly.  They kept my soda glass filled and did give me some more mini rolls since the pizza was taking so long."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. While on duty on the ambulance with my partner, we decided to stop into Streets of New York in order to grab a salad to-go. We arrived approximately 15 minutes before their posted closing time, in uniform, and they refused to serve us when we said we would like to order a salad to-go. They still has patrons in the restaurant. I may have understood if we were trying to order a full pizza 5 minutes prior to closing. However, being refused a salad request 15 minutes before they close, while on duty... is quite disappointing. I will not be returning to this location, or possibly any location for that matter."}
{"text":"If you like your pizza to be cold, tasteless and all crust and no pie, you'll love this place.

If you like your salad to be warm and tasteless (how do you make romaine lettuce have no taste?), this this place is for you.

The best thing about the order was the butter that came with the dinner rolls."}
{"text":"The pizza and chicken are very good. The the crust on the pizza is perfectly baked, and the flavor overall is delicious. The chicken is seriously some of the best fried chicken I've had! It's extra crispy yet juicy and tender on the inside. The food itself deserves 5 stars. The service though was strange... Now to make it clear, I'm not one of those people that discount stars because someone didn't greet me or I noticed my plate had a smear. No, this service was kinda odd. It's a \"seat yourself\" type of place. We walked in, stood up front and looked around for seats. Nobody really acknowledged that we seemed a little lost but no big deal, it's a casual place. It wasn't till we sat down and had different people come around that we noticed that there wasn't really any order or organization between the staff. No assigned stations, or sections to know who serves who. Nobody really knew who came in first, what food went to who or anything like that. Almost as if they hired a bunch of random people and said, \"ok, start working\" and didn't provide any company training or service expectations. Just to be nice and do the best that they could. People that came in after us received their food before we even got our appetizer. We actually never received our appetizer because it was given to another table. After a while our food finally came out but we had no napkins or utensils. Everything was just kinda disorganized. The food was very good so we might give it another try but hopefully the service was just off that day since it was so busy and it gets better."}
{"text":"I order from this place often but on 2 separate occasions now I have found hair in my food. How do I know it's not mine? It was baked into the food. Once in the cheese of the pizza and the other in the  sauce on the wing. Not sure if cooks are wearing nets but they should!"}
{"text":"We came here off and on over the years and the food was waaayy better than what we had tonight! It was so poor we will not be back. The server was good however. 

Tonight's experience can be summed up as lousy and horrible value for the money. The 14 inch pizza we had was a disgrace.
There was BARELY any cheese on it and the sauce and crust were generic quality. I've had many better frozen pizzas out of a box. The cost was ridiculous for the quality of the product . A 14 inch pizza original with cheese only is 15 dollars. Literally, a rip off given the three thimble fulls of cheese on it.That pizza in no way resembled the pizza you see on their website laden with cheese and appealing. 
The dinner salad wasn't bad except had to pick out large pieces of lettuce core out of it which should've gone into the garbage can. 
A friend had the gluten free pizza and it too was meh at best in terms of flavor. Add
Two sodas. Bill 49 dollars. What a rip for that quality, or lack of quality which is more appropriate.
Disappointing. This place has really gone down. Take the time to drive to Grimaldi's instead or Giordanos. Much better quality at both places for the money you spend. 
Now if only we could get one of these places to come to Centennial we'd have it made!"}
{"text":"How difficult is it to make a decent pizza? Not too tough. Alas, this joint has gone downhill and we won't be returning. They used to have a deal where you'd get the antipasta salad with a medium pizza for about 20 bucks, drinks not included. They changed their menu, and we went ahead and ordered that same thing... with drinks, 36 bucks total! Not worth the 20 it was before. The pizza was very dry, not enough sauce, and we even ordered it with extra cheeses, and it was pretty lame. Salad was OK, service was great, but, to me, a 36 dollar lunch should be a gourmet experience!"}
{"text":"We had a bunch of family members in town for our wedding, and ordered a big to-go order of chicken, salad, potatoes, wedding soup, etc. for dinner. It was fresh, tasty and not very expensive. It was ready in less than 20 minutes and easy to pay/pick up. The establishment was clean and friendly. We typically dine organic, which it wasn't. But we felt good after we ate it, so I'm giving it thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Went to this resturant last night. Service was great, food was fresh and delicious! Had pizza & cheese cake. Wine was sooooo good too. 5 stars for sure !!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and wings too. A new favorite for us."}
{"text":"This is our first time at this restaurant we were greeted by Brittany and Kera who were very nice and welcomed us and explained the menu. We were told that their chicken was delicious so thats why we visited.  The chicken is not fried it's cooked \"broasted\" style, it was delicious.  We ordered the two piece white, breast, wing, fried potatoe wedges and a side.  We dined in, the place is very clean.  We ate at the bar and what was amazing was all the people that were coming in for carry out orders they had phoned it, there take out was busy.  while there we were able to see customers being served their meals and what we saw were good sized portions of everything, the salads were big, the pasta servings were good size too.  While we waited for our order we were served garlic bread knots, 4 to plate good size and tasty.  I would have never guessed this Italian pizza place would have such great chicken...but it does and we had a slice of cheese pizza...great.  Bottom line we loved it and will be back real soon."}
{"text":"If I had to describe service at this location in one word, one comes to mind immediately: SLOW. Took several minutes for staff to notice my entry (the \"seat yourself\" sign was out). Took several more minutes to get menus and drink orders in. Took over 10 minutes to get the server's attention to place the order for appetizers and main course. Took another 15 minutes for appetizers and FIRST drink refills. Main course another 15 minutes later SANS ONE ENTRE, which was a further 10 minutes. During the course of packing up leftovers, the server committed, in my mind, the ultimate faux paux by misgendering my girlfriend in spite of how well she presents on a daily basis, and today was no exception. I was displeased to the point of not leaving a tip, and I am seriously debating on whether I shall attempt a return trip in the future. Decent food quality throughout with a few minor annoyances: the honey barbecue sauce for the wings could use some more bottom to balance the sweet and the meat sauce for my pasta was watery and lacked a full-bodied flavor profile. I also heard a microwave door close several times, and that fails to inspire confidence in the freshness of the ingredients. My advice: better eats are to be had for less time, money, and annoyance."}
{"text":"We love, love, love their broasted chicken. Even if they call it broaster chicken. We lived in Chicago for 50 years and ate \"broasted' chicken every week. This chicken is a doppleganger! Even my son-in-law who grew up in Vegas said it was the best chicken he ever ate. Just the right amount of seasonings. Try this place for chicken now. You won't regret it. And a sinner gets you two sides. The wedges are crispy on the outside and fluffy inside, delicious !"}
{"text":"Every time I come here the place is dead and the wait for service is horrible. I love the broasted chicken, or I wouldn't set foot in this place again. But the chicken is very good, and tastie, and there aren't many choices in surprise , or surrounding area ,so I guess I just kinda go with it."}
{"text":"Worst customer experience I have ever experienced with delivery service! After waiting an hour for delivery, called and was informed that they would not be delivering and didn't call to inform me because Eat24 was supposed to do that and it was not her responsibility! Very rude and unprofessional! 

The photo below is how the manager responded to my review so you can see the horrible customer service offered. Yes, I provided the wrong address but was called by the staff and was told they could still deliver and then never showed up or called. Again, poor customer service all round."}
{"text":"So, I had this about three weeks ago. It was fresh, hot and delicious! I ordered a create your own and customized it to have Pesto sauce, mozzarella, basil, sun dried tomatoes, ricotta, and regular tomatoes. It was a huge hit. My boyfriend ordered the buffalo chicken pizza and he liked it but said even for him who enjoys spicy, it was a bit too much heat for him. But all the same, he ate it anyway but LOVED my pizza more haha. 

Unfortunately, I had put my address in wrong the first time for my old condo down the street and they had to come to my new address which is about 3 streets down. But when I went to order it tonight, it said that my current address was not within their delivery distance so I have to go pick it up now. Ehh, it's still worth it though! Should be ready soon, then I'll post my picture! :)"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice now. The pizza is really great the second time I ordered the antipasto salad and was not impressed. The lettuce leaves were too big and there was barely any meat to call it an antipasto. Definitely not worth the price. But I would come back for the pizza."}
{"text":"They have a good deal on yelp for a pizza with one topping. Much more affordable now. It costs $12 for a 1 topping pizza. The pizza does not look like it came from the streets of New York, but it rises above all the chain pizza in the area. It falls in the mid range of pizza, but at this price, it is way better than normal, which is four bucks higher."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my several hours here watching an NBA playoff game. They have one big TV at the bar for viewing, but the other giant TV has turned into a BIllboard for the restaurant showing a loop of the same specials. Time to revert that TV to other programming. Bar staff was great here - one guy was preactically watching the game with me and the female cashier did a great job.
   Tried my ole favorite to go which was the $10.95 Chicken Parmesan dinner. It was pretty good, but the chicken itself could have been a thinner cutlet. Angel Hair and the marinara sauce had some moments. The side salad and bread deal for $2.50 is a good upgrade as well. salad had a variety of veggies, but dressings are not homemade. Bread is a tasty garlic cheese variety. Good draft beer prices too at the bar."}
{"text":"This is the only sit down place within walking distance so we eat here often. We love their pepperoni pizza, hot wings, meatballs, and turkey sandwich (order a side of Italian dressing---you won't be sorry!). The staff is always attentive and friendly, and the beers are always cold!"}
{"text":"This place definitely doesn't disappoint. Everything that I've ordered here, from the spaghetti and lasagna to the wings or the cheesesteak has tasted amazing! I can literally taste the authenticity in the food. This location is the best Streets of NY in the valley. Plus, their staff is very polite."}
{"text":"Amazing NY cheese steak pizza!  Really the best specialty pizza! Great flavor and they have good daily specials."}
{"text":"in the interest of full disclosure: to be fair, I never eat *at* this location, I always get it delivered.

I LOVE the pizza here! One of the only local pizza places I know that offers Green Olives as a topping option (although once, when I had it delivered, I think they subbed Kalamata Olives and it was definitely not great - I would have appreciated some sort of warning). My only problem is the coupon codes rarely go through when I order online, and it's not exactly inexpensive food! Great quality though, and the delivery drivers are always super nice."}
{"text":"The wings and pizza are great the service is a bit slow but the food makes up for it. Never come when you're in a hurry! Decent happy hour but not worth driving out of our way for."}
{"text":"Love this place! Pizza is ALWAYS on point, so far the very best I've had in Phoenix/Scottsdale area"}
{"text":"This is my fourth time eating here and last !!!
I ordered a slice , the Italian sub , and a salad. 
The pizza slice was dry and not enough sauce and it was not hot enough either. 
The sandwich was horrible, I told them to give me provolone cheese instead of Swiss cheese, and they brought me a sandwich with Swiss cheese .
As I was waiting for our food , I looked at how dirty this restaurant is. If you look up at the ceiling and see the black ductwork you will see how dirt is all over the place. Also the vent on the wall , you can see how dirty it is. 
I wouldn't eat here for free"}
{"text":"We really LOVE the Food here. We hate the service!!!!!!

But, I try to rate mostly on the tayste, quality and price of food. They definately get my vote there!

I think the waitresses are either over worked, under worked or under paid or maybe they've been working there so long they don't have the passion for it anymore. They are rude and when they get something wrong, they act like it was your fault, don't offer to fix it and don't even offer to comp anything or make up for it in any way!

We always get the cheese pizza, the italian pizza with everything on it and cheese cake with cherry toping!

My Experience here Saturday Night:

I tried to buy a bottle of wine for take out and the girl had no clue about the wine list. We were going over the different wines (she didn't give me a wine menue) verbally and I asked if they had a wine called \"Layer Cake\" She said, \"No but we have Chocolate Cake.\" Then she pointed to the chocolate cake in the fridg. This was \"After\" I had completely placed my order & paid for it and it already included the Cheese Cake in the prioe order.

LMAO!!!! Is all I can say about that!

I also asked her to NOT put my cheese cake on top of the pizza under the heat. I asked her to get ready for me when I come back to pick it up. Guess what? Right! When I got there the cheese cake was sitting on top of the Hot Pizza under the heat! Exactly what I asked her NOT to do!  I don't like Hot Cheese Cake, SORRY!  

I asked her to give me a new one, reminded her of what I told her 15 minutes ago and she thought I wanted to \"Buy\" another slice! I said no, I want you to replace it. She said, \"but we already put the cherry topping on top.\" 
I was like, never mind and as I walked out the two girls (waitresses) were giving me an ugly look."}
{"text":"Darn!  I been missing out on some great food for 30+ years.   30 years go, a guy friend of mine owned two franchises of Streets of NY, and he kept inviting me to come eat at his restaurants, but never took him up in his invitations.  Yesterday, we had gone into two nearby restaurants where regularly eat, but, walked out do to a foul odor at & insufficient A/C at the other.  So, as we were heading to our car in the heat, & very hungry, we decided to try Streets of NY at 92nd & Northern.  We were greeted by a fun & cheerful gentlemen.  The cup of Italian Wedding soup was pentiful as"}
{"text":"Always order delivery from here.  Nice variety of options.  My favorite is the spaghetti calzone, pizza pasta and broasted chicken.   Service is wonderful."}
{"text":"The lunch specials are awesome at this place! The lunch salads are amazing and filling, yet they are perfect complements to half a sandwich or slice of pizza. The environment is friendly and welcoming. The owner, Stacy, is ever present and a delightful hostess. 
I have dined here at least 2 years, so it's time for a review. I will come back again and again."}
{"text":"Ive ordered from here on 3 different occasions.  Ive had some issues regarding the service but the owner, Scott contacted me and made good on his pledge to make it right.  On the next order, the food arrived in 38 minutes and was hot.  Much better job this time around!   If this service keeps up I will ordering more from here."}
{"text":"Pizza was great! Took my two grandchildren and placed an order before I got there.  Pizza was ready when we got there and the kids were happy they didn't have to wait   Thanks for the great service and great tasting pizza"}
{"text":"The pizza isn't bad here- it's just so over priced- it has you scratching your head. 

Tonight I had the pizza and wings special, which was around $22, so not bad. I added the garlic rolls, which for some god forsaken reason they call \"Passion rolls\"? It's perplexing to me, but there you go. I also ordered a slice of chocolate cake $6.00 which ended up being so dry and chalky-it tasted how I imagine space food would taste. Bland, and completely devoid of flavor. 

Lastly I ordered my stuff online and selected it to be ready in one hour. I arrived at the appointed time and was told the \"passion\" rolls were just starting to cook. Again- this isn't life and death- but it's weird that even with an hours notice my food couldn't be on time 

In summary- the pizza is respectable, but the price point and other issues here make it hard to place this spot in your regular rotation.  I am happy to pay good money for top tier pizza- but this isn't special pizza- just regular so I don't see how they justify the higher than reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Been eating here off and on when I am on leave and visiting the family!
Their pizza and pasta is great! The service and staff are great also!! Anything you order off the menu you cannot go wrong!"}
{"text":"The staff including Jaime, the manager, were absolutely fabulous and professional.
A diamond in the rough. Food is, as always, consistent and deliciousEnjoyed everything"}
{"text":"The pizza's great but good luck getting any, or getting it right, if you order online. They can't get toppings on halves right. They don't know where they deliver to. They ignore later delivery requests.  Order from somewhere else and save yourself some hassle."}
{"text":"We love this place! Great for kids! Great service.. the pizza is good! The Broaster's chicken is amazing!!!!! Also house wine for $5.00 can't
Go wrong!"}
{"text":"I ordered the fries with Parmesan, parsley, garlic, salt. I asked for them to go light on the salt and they didn't put anything at all! It was literally just fries... no parmesan or anything. They also forgot my cheesy garlic bread! They offered me a free fry on my next visit but honestly I don't think I will be ordering from again."}
{"text":"Good food and quick.  The hot pastrami sub was VERY good.  Service was a bit slow to come back and fill drinks but was ok.  Would go back."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices for good food. We always get soup and then my wife gets the broaster chicken. I usually get wings and a sandwhich. I always leave full and satisfied. I am not a big fan of the pizza here but everything else is good. 

The service is hit and miss depending on whos working. Ita been awhile since I have been back because last time I had a billing issue they said would be taken care of it wasent but it wasent anything serious. 

I really love this location. Very chamring and the out door seating is awesome when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"The wings though.... ugh soooo good!! They aren't fried I think they are grilled or baked. I got the honey hot & they were amazing!! Wish I had a pic to share but ate them all you should too!"}
{"text":"I went to Streets of New York last night and in general was underwhelmed.  In regards to the food, we had the 16\" Pizza with cheese and a medium order of wings, (medium heat).  The wings were passable, although I'm not going to be overly critical as it's a pizza place and I try not to use non-Italian American food to review a place like this. The pizza was fresh and they obviously good quality ingredients but the taste was not in the style of an authentic Pizzeria. The dough just wasn't right for an advertised authentic NY style, (or Neopolitan), pizza.    I was born in Queens and lived on Long Island for 32 years so I think I'm qualified to know what New York style pizza is at this point, and this place is not the real deal. The pizza was okay, but I wasn't bowled over either.  
I will say the service was excellent for a busy Friday night and everyone employee I saw there was in good spirits.  The food came out in a timely fashion as well. 
The ambiance of the restaurant was nice, although it can get real cramped in a hurry on a busy night.  They do have outdoor seating when the weather warrants as well.
All in all this is the kind of place that is good in a pinch or just to change up the routine, but there are better places in the area."}
{"text":"I am in disbelief at the outrageously priced food here. Two medium pizzas, 18 wings and two domestic beers for $75! For mediocre pizza and wings. I have had pizza and wings with craft beer that are much higher quality for half the price. Never again. I don't understand why people are willing to spend so much money and keep returning to give them business!"}
{"text":"Im just going to make this quick. This place is bomb! I had a great sandwich and the service was amazing. Recommend 10/10!"}
{"text":"Decided to try a new place for pizza delivery ... And sorry I made that choice. Ordered a margarita pizza and kids mac and cheese. Dry - both the pizza and Mac and cheese. I might give it a try again and order something else but first, I need to drink some water."}
{"text":"Good gluten free pizza. We really liked the buffalo wing pizza. Gluten free crust was a little sweeter than I like it, but it was still really good."}
{"text":"This is NOT NY PIZZA!

I came here only once for lunch, and tried the pizza here for the first time. 2 slices of sausage, and a dinner salad. Both slices were thicker than your basic delivery chain pizza. The pizza was very thick crust, puffy and chewy, and the sausage was little balls of meat that tasted like it was from a frozen pizza. 

Overall the pizza was NOT very good!

This place should never call itself a NY Pizza joint. Thick crust IS NOT NY PIZZA!!!!!!!!!!! 

Wow it's truly is a crime to call this NY Pizza!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised to see some negative comments here as I've always had good experiences at this Streets location. I've dined in & also ordered delivery on multiple occasions and the pizza has almost always been fantastic. Most of the time, my deliveries are well before the scheduled time. I had one experience where the delivery driver accidentally dropped my pizza so he had to run back and get a new one and was therefore delayed. The manager, Julio, apologized and offered to pay for half of the cost of the pizza. The delivery driver was also very apologetic and nice. I own a business and I appreciate good customer service - that's what I've gotten here in addition to great food!"}
{"text":"I ordered the hot pastrami sandwich and fries to go. Decent price. Food came fast. Both items were delicious. It's not easy to find good pastrami. First time customer. Will go back."}
{"text":"One of our favorite winter places(snow birds). Great food. Pizza it great , yummy subs   Anti-pasta salad is my husbands favorite .  We like happy hour specials. And it's less than a mile from our house.  What more could you want!"}
{"text":"Long overdue rating. Love their chicken Parmesan sandwich and their beer cheese is delicious with unlimited passion bread. Happy hour beer for 2$ was a nice plus as well. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Just ate THEE best pizza! Pepperoni mushroom onion and black olive hand tossed thin (which is not on the menu) so ask for it!! Can't wait to be hungry again! Great Atmosphere AND BEER are a bonus."}
{"text":"Streets of New York is a chain restaurant that doesn't feel like a chain restaurant.  They have them all over town, but every time I walk into my local SoNY, I feel like I'm at an independent \"Mom & Pop\" restaurant.

My boyfriend and I have a tradition of heading to SoNY the day after a big night out.  It's the perfect hangover cure!  We recently headed over around 3:00 p.m. the day after my boyfriend's birthday.  The hostess invited us to choose our own booth, and we selected our favorite - the big round corner booth.  After placing our order, we got our drinks and a big basket of  (complimentary) \"passion bread\".  

Passion bread is what all breadsticks should aspire to be.  It's cut into small bite-sized pieces, seasoned with a light sprinkle of garlic parmesan flavor, and served with a bowl of marinara sauce.  Yum!  The pizza takes a while to bake, so we like to take our time drinking and munching on this delicious bread, while chatting and cuddling.

Once the pizza arrives (we love the four-cheese on thin crust with extra sauce), we are usually already pretty full from the bread.  We generally manage to eat a couple of slices each, and then the rest goes home for leftovers.  

Streets of New York serves a lot more than pizza, too, but I doubt we'll ever order anything different.  Old habits die hard, I guess."}
{"text":"If I could I'd give zero stars! I ordered 2.5 hours ago and the food just barely got here. The pizza had been sitting out for so long it was barely Luke warm and the cheese had gotten a hard like plasticity feel and taste to it. With all the time they took to get here you'd think they could at least give me more then 1 packet of ketchup for my fries (asked for xtra). To top things off the driver was extremely rude and tried to step in my house to grab the food when I called his work to discuss his behavior. Very disappointed and will NEVER ORDER AGAIN! Oh and to top if off they gave me 79cent soda from frys for my coke that I paid 2.50 for. This place sucks and had I known I could post pics on here I would posted a picture of it. My good friend was with me who just happens to be a cook at a fine dining restaurant in the area and choose toaster strudels over the crap presented so rudely at my door!"}
{"text":"Had the New York combo pizza and a spaghetti and marinara sauce. 

Both extremely average dishes. 

We also were served bread and marinara sauce while we were waiting, which was pretty good. 

Good service. Average cleanliness."}
{"text":"I order a pizza and side salad to go for dinner.  One couple in the restaurant and it was 6:30 pm.  I have had better frozen pizza and the Italian dress was lackluster."}
{"text":"Pizza was very good !!  My son who live local recommended ! I would have rated higher but parking lot had no lights so when 2 women pickup pizza not totally comfortable . Plus all workers were dressed Goth and we really did not feel comfortable . But pizza was good ."}
{"text":"Really good garlic knots and pizza. Had the lasagna a few years ago and it was great! This year pizza seems to be my \"thing...\", and this is one of the best Streets around!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a mixed review. I showed up for Monday night trivia, which made for a completely packed restaurant as there just isn't a lot of space inside and they didn't have outdoor seating when we showed up. Trivia was fun, but because it was packed, service was pretty slow (it took almost 10 minutes for us to find a seat - it was \"seat yourself\" and none of the staff were willing to help, 10 minutes to take a drink order, and 15 minutes to take a food order after the drinks, and my friend actually didn't get her Coke until right before the food showed up, almost an hour after we walked in the place). It was busy, and I get that, but they didn't seem to have a good system in place to begin with - there seemed to be 1 waitress for the whole place and a guy who would just refill drinks. The servers were nice despite the stress, but it just didn't seem to be working out well. When you're hosting an event, put more servers on the schedule! 

The menu is pretty big and my whole group had a tough time deciding what to get. As I have Celiac's, I was excited to see that you could make your own gluten free pizza. I ordered one. I was a little hesitant - I figured that in the rush, more mistakes would get made and the risk for cross contamination would be higher - but I was craving pizza and got it against my better judgment. I should have avoided this place altogether. I had a horrible reaction before we even left the restaurant. 

That being said, my friends really enjoyed their meals. If you have a food allergy, I would steer clear of this place, but otherwise, it seems like an alright place to grab a bite (though I might avoid trivia night until the crowds die down)."}
{"text":"Came here 12/14/13 for lunch with my wife Carol. There was only one other couple dining. Our waitress Cassidy took our drink order and gave us ample time to look over the menu. We both decided on the broaster Chicken. I haven't had broaster Chicken in years. It was delicious.

The chicken was marinated and coated in a golden brown, crispy-crunchy coating. The  chicken was heavenly.  I am salivating now, just by trying to remember its taste.
Both combo's came with braoster potato wedges. The potatoes were extremely hot, crispy,  


Second of all, PRICING wise, they are CHEAP. Or should I say budget-friendly.

FOOD: Chicken was fabulous.  It was crispy, hot fresh, and tasty. SERVICE: Was spot on. Attentive and professional. PRICE: The price IS very reasonable. CONCLUSION:  RETURN FACTOR 100%. 
  
    ******************* What does my OVERALL rating mean? ********************

5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well! 
4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business. 
3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again. 
2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family. 
1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISH"}
{"text":"They should have some kind of taste testing before a restaurant is allowed to put New York in its name. None of the pies resemble anything that would come out of real NY oven. The thin crust I spotted at another table looked ulta thin, ala oregeno's style and the hand tossed was overloaded with cheese and i was barely able to fold the slice. We ordered some combo pie with everything so it might have been impossible either way, but still lacking in quality and true NY style. The happy hour beers and free average garlic knots were a nice touch and the waitress was great. If your feeling romantic, ask for the booth in back cause it only has one side for people to sit on and your kind of forced to sit close. THey ran out of room and that booth is what ended up chopped."}
{"text":"We ordered....told 45 minutes....was over an hour.

Wrong pizza....wrong wings....driver (not his fault) rang the doorbell again.... said maybe the wrong pizza... well... yes...it was. He said he'd be right back.

So I called... spoke to a nice young lady.... then this incompetent guy named Chip...who claimed to be the manager came on the line.

He was a complete jerk. He offered me a discount on my next order! What about this one???

I admit I went off on him...but his customer service skills are severely lacking. He told me to call corporate.... then hung up on me!! What a jerk!! All I asked for.... what can you do for me on THIS order.....NOTHING!!

$43 bucks for a pizza and wings.... gave the driver a $10 tip.... again... not his fault....

$53 bucks.... and this jerk Chip.... I will NEVER order from this location again. He was a complete idiot!"}
{"text":"I had recalled this place during my brief time in Scottsdale and was excited to see there were locations here in town.  

Location:  This spot is located in the far Northwest in an area that has continued to grow over the past few years.  It is situated in a cute little mall similar to the district in Henderson, but considerably smaller.   I get the sense the mall was to be larger but construction stopped midway.  Still it is a very cute area.

Ambiance:  The inside is nice  It is a bit small but had a nice little bar and plenty of tables with MLB and ESPN on the tvs.  I also noticed a patio for when it isnnt in the 100s lol.  I think it would be a cool place to stop at on the way home to catch a game.  I have read they have happy hour specials, but not positive about that or what they might be.

Food:  We order just a couple slices of pepperoni.  As we waited we were served complimentary Passion bread.  The bread was pretty good.  I definitely would want to have it again.  The pizza overall was solid.  The crust was quite soft when bitten into.  I could not recall if this was what I had, had experienced previously, but I might ask for it to be cooked a bit longer next time.  It was still quite tasty.  The cheese and pepperoni both tasted great.

Service: We were the only folks in the place.  I imagine the extreme heat and time of day contributed to that.  The waitress was attentive and we had no complaints.

Price:  We went during their lunch time (10:30-4pm) and slices, beverages. and bread all came in at about $15.  Definitely a great price.

All in all had a great experience and look forward to hitting up this area again.  I was shocked to hear they had been in business for over five years in that location.  I hope for the area to continue to build to further the foot traffic."}
{"text":"I love Streets of New York. The crust is perfect--it's crispy and airy at the same time. I also the mozzarella cheese they use for their pizza here. They cook the pizza perfectly, so the cheese on top is brown in places and the sauce is great too. 

The service is usually excellent at this location in particular. They keep the refills coming on drinks. If you go after five in the evening they even have these great bread balls they give you for free as an appetizer type thing. 

Other than just great pizza, Streets of New York also has other great food, including, toasted sub sandwiches I have never tried them, but both my mom and boyfriend really love them, so they must be good. (especially since my boyfriend can be quite critical and picky when it comes to food) 

This place is wonderful and definitely keeps me coming back!"}
{"text":"Yip, see the two reviews below...
My boyfriend and I walked in 20-minutes to close and received a very nice eye-roll and sigh from a lady waitstaff who didn't even bother to get up from her seat to greet us.   We walked in, and walked right out out.  There are two other pizza places within a reach; Barros and Pullanos.  If this restaurant wants to stay in business, they may not want to chase off the locals and our EMT crews that had often frequented this place.  Word-of-mouth referrals go such a long way."}
{"text":"I normally like Streets of New York however the staff at this location seemed to be in a hurry to get home. Even before closing time. All I wanted was a salad 15 minutes before closing. But that seemed to be too much of a task. Don't be fooled by there so called closing time. They stop serving people at a quarter till. Not even a salad."}
{"text":"Fantastic thin crust pizza! 

Streets of New York has quality food in a comfortable environment with friendly service. 

That is why they will be around long after the trendy PIzza places that surround them go out of business."}
{"text":"The food is a bit average the broasted chicken was bland and not seasoned.. I ordered the sausage and Pepas pizza it was tasty once I picked off the hard the chew onions... I won't be returning it's not worth price"}
{"text":"Maybe times have changed since I frequented this place while living in Phoenix in 2006.   I always had great fresh pizza, served by friendly folks.  Sad to see the reviews are showing an apparant slide downhill.  Yes it is never really packed, and considering the size, this is one of the benefits."}
{"text":"Very good overall. The order was correct, service was expedient and polite. Food was downright tasty.

Made the mistake of trying another location, thinking they'd all be the same. 

Sticking with Union Hills in the future."}
{"text":"I've frequented four other SoNY locations. This one is the worst quality by far. The quality/taste of the food lingered between stale and passable. The order was incorrect. However, it was carry out and I didn't want to wait another 10-15 minutes for them to prepare the food properly. 

Not sure why this chain isn't up to snuff. If you *must* order SoNY, try to find another location close by.

I'd read the other reviews and thought, \"It couldn't be that bad. It's a chain, they're all the same.\"

Lesson learned."}
{"text":"Bomb pizza and wings along with beer specials almost all the time.  Although it's not hard to please me in the food department, I am confident that even picky eaters will like Streets of New York.  If you go to this location, ask for Crystal.  She is the coolest, by far their best server. Get the wings with medium sauce, extra crispy, with extra sauce on the side, the New York combo pizza, and a Bud Light; then proceed to slip into an unhealthy, sweaty, yet satisfying slumber.  If you commit to working out the day after you eat the pizza, wings, and beer, you shouldn't blow up too much... if you do, it's worth it.  They only lose a star for their delivery... expensive delivery and the food comes to you cold even though I live only about 3 miles away."}
{"text":"Streets of New York was awesome to hold accommodate our very large group. On Monday, we gathered our orders for the event to give Streets of New York our orders. The next day, our horde descended on the restaurant. A group of us straggled in after the main group, and we sat to the side in a booth. The \"two sisters\" took care of us. We gave them our first names and shortly, our order arrived. I enjoyed my Caesar Salad. It was a little under-dressed for my taste, but I appreciated the delicious Parmesan sprinkled over the salad. I noticed the lovely shaved Parm on the garden salads. I ordered the turkey half sandwich with chips. The chips were fresh and crisp. The turkey was non-descript, but the bread was nicely toasted. I noticed another person ordered the meatball sub with melted cheese which looked amazing. The service was friendly, and our servers were pretty attentive especially considering we had a large crowd. I will be back to try the meatball sub."}
{"text":"Used to order from this restaurant regularly but will not do so any longer. Delivery driver showed up with food with the person ordering being my wife who was not at home. I assumed that she had ordered something for herself for when she got home so I paid. I called my wife to tell her that her food arrived and she said that she didn't order anything. I called the restaurant to clear it up and their answer was you paid so you got food. I asked for a credit or gift card and they said they wouldn't do anything. It's a shame because we're regular customers but will not be any longer."}
{"text":"It's streets of New York. It's good, not bad,  not great.  
Does this help? Lol"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here on 6/29 for a quick little date night. Our server, Ashley was very rude and very snappy. Our food took forever to get there and then when we finally received our pizza it was horrible!! We mentioned it to our waitress and all she said \" want me to box it up for you?\"- took the food boxed it up and brought us our check. She did not offer to make it right once. When we received our check she even charged us $1 for ranch that we asked for but were never told we were going to be charged for it. Horrible service- Horrible food!!!"}
{"text":"I picked up two pizzas for a carry out order.They refused to honor my Entertainment coupon, so I was forced to order their horrible pizzas. I used my Entertainment coupon before to order their two subs. But I could not order subs, I HAD TO, HAD TO ORDER THEIR HORRIBLE PIZZA which gave me a belly ache. Terrible customer service, the WORST PIZZA ON THE PLANET,
A TOTAL RIP OFF OF ALMOST $40 BUCKS. I TOOK A BITE OUT OF MY PIZZA AND I HAD TO THROW IT AWAY. Do not waste your time and money here, GO TO METRO PIZZA. METRO PIZZA HAS GREAT PIZZA AND GREAT FRIENDLY SERVICE. You disgust me, Streets of New York."}
{"text":"This place sucks.  One cook, one server and the place was empty.  Not sure why it took 30 minutes to get lunch.  Nothing special and you would have thought they were out chasing the chickens down Deer Valley Rd for my 'broaster' chicken.  Dressing for a sub sandwich is supposed to be italian but its more like water with red wine vinegar. This place sucks. Never going there again."}
{"text":"The Sandwiches and othe dishes looked great, but we had Pizza and Wings. The WINGS are AWESOMEand the wing sauces! I had a thing rust pizza, and the table also ordered 2 18\" pizzas. The Toppings were great, and complimentary garlic bread sticks were great. I love thin crust, but according the rest of the table the best thing about the NY pizza are the toppings and that the dough and tomato sauce were good, but not great. In the end our expeience resulted in WINGS outweighted Pizza... but totally worth going to, and the visit... next time we're in town I hope to try the sandwhiches and pasta."}
{"text":"Girlfriend took me here for my birthday. Awesome pizza. A little pricey but well worth it."}
{"text":"This is the first time at this location (usually I frequent the  91st/Northern location) and between both places I've never been let down.  Fantastic food, excellent service (had Sabrina today) & a great atmosphere.  I can't say enough about both places, I'll definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"The worst service ever! We sat at the bar ( only 2 tables in the restaurant had people at them) took 2 min to even get a beer. After 30 min and an empty beers we had to ask for menus took another 20 for someone to take our order.  Don't come if your hungry! Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was disgusting, raw chicken, cold and soggy.
We literally couldn't eat our dinner. I tried for two weeks to get a hold of the manager only to be turned down every time.  I was told repeatedly that the manager was in an \" all day\" meeting or had just stepped out. 
I find it funny that during dinner and lunch rush you have no manager on site for two weeks? No wonder the food was so bad. This was a very expensive mistake, please don't order from here unless of course you want salmonella."}
{"text":"We have been going to Streets since the 80's, and it used to be our go to place for pizza and Italian food. Not any more.

Yesterday' we went at Happy Hour to take advantage of the specials. The place was almost empty at dinnertime. We took a seat, and our server took good care of us during our stay. 

Well, they changed the menu again, and some of our favorite happy hour items were missing. We ordered the meatballs anyway. They were good but barely warm, and they reduced the amount from 5 to 3 for the same price. 

We both decided on pasta for our main course. My wife had angel hair with marinara.  It was an over sauced gummy dried out mess.  I had baked penne with a side salad. The salad was good, but the penne was also a gummy pasty mess, and the sausage tasted off. We both ate part of it and took the rest to go.  We decided today to toss them because we couldn't face them again.

Streets has always been on the pricey side, but I felt that the quality was worth it. It is still pricey, but quality has slipped to where I can no l recommend it and I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I am definitely torn writing this review. I will say that the pizza cold the next day was much better than it was fresh and hot. 

We ordered an antipasto salad which did not have enough dressing. The portion was small. Four of us maybe got 1/2 cup each of salad. For $12 you would expect to get a larger portion. The sausage and peppa pizza sounded good. Sausage, green peppers, ricotta, onion and garlic. Honestly it was probably the worst pizza I've ever had. Ranch is from a bottle - yuck. I was beginning to regret having chose this place for dinner. 

But my friends there is a saving grace, and it's name is broasted chicken. Broasted is broiled and roasted. It's crunchy like fried chicken but not greasy. It's seriously sooo good. The 8 piece meal is $20 and it comes with two sides and some potato wedges. We got the coleslaw which was really good, and fries which were just whatever. We all wished we would have ordered more chicken and not pizza, but you live and you learn."}
{"text":"Came with a group of friends and was very impressed. We got a bit of everything. We got a cheese pizza which was very cheesey, soft, and the bottom wasn't toasted. It was cooked but, not tpasted. We also got traditional wings with buffalo sauce and they were good and all but not as spicy as we'd expect. We got a sub with many meats and it was delicious. The outside of the bread was toasted but not to where the bread breaks as soon as you bite into it. The sun came with fries and they were some of the best fries I've had. They were crunchy and had lots of flavor. We got boneless wings and they were the best. Fresh, juicy, cooked to the right coction. While waiting for our food we got mini garlic breads and they were so golden and toasted we didn't want to eat them but we did. As an appetizer we got spinach and artichoke dip which was very creamy and flavorful and the pieces of bread were so toasted that it made a bit of a mess but it was all very good.
Over all, we really enjoyed our time. And prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"Had lunch at the restaurant, so cannot speak to delivery issues other reviewers have had.  Had the steakhouse sub, which was pretty good. A little on the greasy side, but overall a solid sandwich. Fries weren't bad, but nothing to rave over. I will eat here again."}
{"text":"This has got to be the worst Streets of NY in town. I ordered mozzarella sticks and they not only looked disgusting, but they tasted just as bad. They were either extremely freezer burnt or the breading was not supposed to be on a mozzarella stick. The pizza was jusok but not great. The cheese ravioli with meat sauce looked like it had dog food for meat sauce. I feel sick just thinking about what I just ate. I think they just ruined Streets of NY for me for life, thanks a lot."}
{"text":"Poor service! Even if your the only people in the place the service stinks! Food is ok but doesn't out way the service!"}
{"text":"Always great service, delivery doesn't take forever & food is great quality. Real food and hearty."}
{"text":"We love their food!! The staff is always friendly. We like to also order delivery, which takes over an hour (even when they say 45 mins when you order online, FYI). I think they just have limited delivery staff. It's still hot and fresh when it gets here, though, we just NOW plan for well over an hour wait..."}
{"text":"We are new to the area and were in need of great pizza been to many sony in the past so figured we couldn't go wrong here. haven't even got into the food and I'm so glad we came! Our server Ashley was fantastic,so fun!! Great place to chill and have a beer on the patio especially in weather like this. And duh the pizza is amazing! Do yourself a favor and come here!!!....ask for Ashley!"}
{"text":"I would give it a ZERO if I could absolutely horrible! Service was sub par once we were seated in an empty dining room on a Saturday night at 7 PM it took forever for the waiter to come took our drink order, never brought them, took our food order 45 minutes later with two small children the appetizer came! my six-year-old manage to get his ravioli dinner and ate it while we all waited on our food! so basically I had a young child that completed his meal and we didn't even start yet! When the food and come the calzone was so bright it was an edible but I was not about to re-order at salad course came with the meal. Three other table sat after us and had similar problems I saw one complain to the manager one it took them 20 minutes to get there water to their table and then their food with no utensils. The waiter seemed oblivious to what was going on and with two of them in the dining room with three tables you think it would be manageable. I used a Groupon to pay so the manage had to handle the transaction, I Took the opportunity to complain she was at my table side. No apology no correction on the items she told me they got busy I let her know that I come there frequently both dining room and take out it's always fairly slow especially the takeout but never like this it's completely unacceptable! If is 3 tables is busy, she needed better wait staff & a manger to watch what's going on. We used to take out quite frequently from here and my kids loved going on Saturday night to listen to the guitar player but won't be going again that's for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a 16-inch New York Combo pizza over the phone. When I got there, they brought me out a different pizza from what I ordered and expected me to take it. When I refused, they went into the back and found the pizza that I did order and brought it out to me. When we started to eat the pizza, we discovered that there was no dough/crust in the center of the pizza. It was so thin in the middle that the tomato sauce and ingredients ate away all of the dough. Really horrible experience, and I have had several from this restaurant. I will not be back."}
{"text":"I love streets of New York! And this one is the best right next to the one on Happy valley road!! Not sure why anyone would have a bad review about this place it's great! Some people are just born haters!!"}
{"text":"Ok so I said I probably wouldn't go back because of service. I lied. I've been back and I'll admit it seems like things may have gotten better. Who cares though, I really like this pizza. 

I've gotten delivery as well which was super-fast. I just can't stay away from this place and their damn thin crust Italiano pizza. It's addicting."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I have been here; but, I'm a fan...I had the NY combo pizza; delicious sauce, and really enjoyed it.  My friend had the Chicken Parm sandwich; she is from Long Island; and really loved the sandwich...My other friend tried the fried chicken; \"Broaster Chicken\"; it was extremely good - I have a new fried chicken take out place."}
{"text":"Good finger food as well as dinners and excellent salads. Serves beer on tap too. Ask for Jamie...she's a sweetie."}
{"text":"I ordered lasagna, dinner salad and soup.  The Italian wedding soup tasted just like Italian dressing.  It used to be so good. I was so disappointed in it that I saved it for a week to get a refund since I only took two bites but never found the time to take it in and deal with the manager I spoke to that seemed hesitant to provide a refund vs. a replacement product. All the herby delicious flavor was gone and sweet, sweet, sweet took over. Don't they know not to mess with a good thing. Either they changed the recipe or they have a lazy cook.

The lasagna was good but also really sweet. The portion for the price was disappointing. For that much money, I will just make a pan at home and freeze some portions.  

The dinner salad was fantastic. Full of yummy, crispy veggies. If the lettuce had been drained and the dressing didn't come out of a bottle with so much sugar it could gag you, I would get that salad twice a week. 

I won't be returning for anything BUT the salad, and only if I have my own dressing.

Bummer update."}
{"text":"We think this is among the best pizza, at least in our area if not the valley. 

But service definitely leaves a lot to be desired. The restaurant was busy but still no excuse. We had to ask for plates and silverware, more than once. Then they didn't bring enough silverware. Had to ask for refills on drinks. When we asked for a box for leftovers the waitress gave us a styrofoam thing that wouldn't work for pizza so I had to ask for a pizza box. 

I think we will stick to delivery to enjoy the pizza and not have to endure the poor service."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience I ever had with delivery , this shouldn't even get a one star rating . Uber eats goes to pick up my order which is paid for and the employees said they just forgot to make it . He admitted to it on the phone ! I couldn't believe it, I obviously ordered uber eats for a reason I couldn't drive to get it . The person on the phone didn't even try to help to make it better . How is this Business open when the employees don't even care? This was around 8:13pm , if I wouldn't have called I probably would have paid for nothing . DONT GO HERE , waste of time !"}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza and salad for delivery from GrubHub. While my delivery showed up on time, my order was wrong. The pizza was missing 2 of the toppings I was charged for and was under-cooked. Additionally my salad came with the wrong dressing. The experience was disappointing. It's the small things that make a difference and Streets of New York dropped the ball tonight."}
{"text":"July 15 2017
Fast and Friendly service. Very relaxed and mellow atmosphere. Baked wings are great and thin crust pizza was good just need more flavor in the sauce."}
{"text":"This restaurant is normally very pleasant to visit.  However tonight was a different story.  I walked in and there were only 5 or 6 tables occupied and it was open seating.  There appeared to be 3 servers.  Two of them looked at me when I walked in but never greeted me.  I sat down towards the Northern wall.  The servers walked by me several time as I waited to be helped for about 15 minutes and still never offered a greeting.

Finally I approached one of the servers that was clearing a booth and asked for a menu and took the empty booth.

I proceeded to order their cheesy bread which was to be brought out first.  It was but only by about 3 minutes.  It was supposed to come with marinara, it did, but I had to ask for it.  It was such a tiny little cup I also asked for another and some napkins as well since no one brought those.

He returned with my pizza, the extra marinara, and napkins.  As he took the napkins off the plate you could see big as day that it was filthy with a big ole dried tomato smack dab in the center.  I will try to upload a picture.

I went to take a bite of the sorry excuse of the cheesy bread that the brought out.  Nothing like the ones I received 2 weekends ago and countless times before and they were still frozen in the middle.

At this point I asked for a to go box for my untouched pizza and my check.

Very, very disappointing to drive across town to receive this kinda of service!



**Updated 1/3/18**  I have recently revisited this location on 3 separate occasions and it appears that the issues that I had have been corrected.  Everything was great, food and service!  I have also updated my star rating that I had left prior to this update."}
{"text":"**** UPDATE**** 

I previously uploaded a bad review, I went on and on about how this isn't NY style etc.... however they made it right, after my review I was given a gift card to try again and let me tell you it was MUCH better the second time.  But this time I got carry out and I went during the day.  So maybe that was the difference.  I still don't think it warrants five stars but much better than the first time around.  Will I go back? Possibly but not often.  Still too pricey for what it's supposed to be.  But at least I wasn't angry at the world this time around.  So Thank You Debra Deasy for making things right.  I appreciate you and your time and consideration to make it right.  I do appreciate the extreme effort you went through to make your customer happy.  Thank you."}
{"text":"My family and I LOVE this place! The employees are always awesome and the food great. :)"}
{"text":"After my party arrived, we were told that bread was in the oven, and it should be out shortly.  Thirty minutes later, another couple walked in, was seated, and they were eating bread while our table was still bare.  Very disappointing service.

Our waitress was absent-minded, and absent in general.  We had to ask the manager a few times to bring her over to take our order or bring us a drink we had ordered ten minutes prior.  The place was nearly empty when we arrived.

Our appetizer order was put in after sitting for 20 minutes.  We waited probably another 15 minutes waiting to make a pizza order.  We had two small children with us, so we really didn't want to sit and wait for hours and hours.  We still wanted to order a pizza, and our waitress is nowhere to be found.  People are coming in, making to-go orders, getting them and leaving.  The manager walked by, and we asked if he could get our waitress since we were ready to order.  Finally, about 5-10 minutes later, she arrives and take the pizza order.  We wait 10 more minutes for any food to arrive.  By this time, we had been there 40 minutes with no bread or appetizers. Finally, a batch of cold garlic bread sticks arrived with steaming marinara.  It seems that the kitchen DID make the bread as our waitress promised so long ago, but the order sat out for quite awhile before it made it to us.

A few moments later, the appetizers arrived.  Then the pizza came, but we still hadn't received dinner plates.

I'm giving 5 stars for the food.  The pizza, wings, and spinach artichoke dip were excellent.  I'm giving negative 3 stars for the service.  Absolutely terrible experience.  When we left the restaurant was empty.  Several other tables came and went while we dined.  Feeling ignored doesn't sit well.

We will not return to Streets of New York on 90th & Shea."}
{"text":"Very easy in and out take out, super fast, even during
Lunch hour. Delicious pizza, very good prices!"}
{"text":"This place is known for their pizza, but personally, I find the pizza mediocre and overpriced. So why 4 stars?  The best hot subs I've ever had! The other italian dishes I've tried have been good as well, but the subs set Streets of New York apart from the rest. At dinner time, everone gets a complimetnary bowl of bread and marinara sauce."}
{"text":"Ramon and Emily have always been great in their customer service. That alone would be five stars!  Four stars for bathroom size/cleanliness and three stars for not having a place to change a baby. I understand that it is no always feasible, which is why I still throw three stars out. 

Wings are above average, pizza pretty darn good. One out of three pizzas were soggy, but we enjoy the atmosphere and service enough to get a better sampling of the food in the future."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service from the day manager. 

My wife ordered 3 large pizzas for my son's birthday. I went to pick them up. When I got there, I was informed that their credit card machine was having issues with some cards. She tried it twice, and it gave her an error. She didn't offer to take another payment method, she turned her back to me and started walking away. 

I then stated that it was pretty screwed up that they didn't inform us of the issue when we ordered. She then said, \"I'll give you the pizzas for free\". GREAT! I wasn't trying to get one over on them, I simply wanted the pizza for the birthday party. If she wouldn't have offered, I would've went down the street and ordered from Barro's. 

Later that day, the day manager called my wife to settle the balance. This came as a bit of a shock, as she stated that they were free. If she would've said \"can I call you once it's fixed?\", I would've happily taken that option. She also stated that I threatened her and intimidated her, which was certainly not the case. I was upset, but I never yelled, cursed, or said anything that could be perceived as intimidating or even rude. 

When I asked for the owners phone number, she refused to provide it. She also refused to identify herself. The night manager got on the line, and provided her name and the owners name and phone number. I do plan on calling him directly. 

This location was much better when the previous management was in place. I didn't ask to get the pizzas free, she clearly offered. But to call me 4 hours later with false accusations and demanding payment is ridiculous. 

Hopefully the owner realizes that employees like the day manager are cancerous. She needs to get out of customer service before she runs the place into the ground."}
{"text":"We really love the food here. I think it's the best pizza in town. The bad service makes it really hard to come here. We eat here at least every other month and every time the servers seem miserable and unhappy."}
{"text":"Streets of New York is an awesome place for lunch (and I would guess it's also great for dinner but more pricey). They have great lunch specials, yummy satisfying food, and quick friendly service. 

- Pizza: Very satisfying. The crust is thicker than normal new york style pizza (which I like because it makes it more substantial) yet it's still nice and light. I guess I woudn't technically call it \"New York\" style pizza BUT it is really good pizza regardless. The sauce is flavorful and well balanced and there's lost of cheese that doesn't slip and slide all over like most new york style slices. 
- Salads: Great! Usually pizza places have lame salads, but Streets of New York has fresh ingredients and a lot of different salad options (like pear blue cheese, spinach, greek, cobb, etc.). The dinner size is sizable enough for an entree (if you can sneak some bites of someone else's hot food to round it out)."}
{"text":"Pizza was delicious, but pricy! Delivery time was as expected.  We were in The Pointe Squaw Peak so the driver brought us plenty of plates and napkins.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"What happened to this place?
You used to have to wait to get in. I see now why it's slow. We asked for a booth and they got upset even tho booths were available. We never got bread we had to ask for it. Pasta was terrible, a clump of sauce thrown on cold pasta, not fresh. $11 Antipasto salad was small w/ no extra dressing. Server disappeared to ask for more. Nobody took our dirty plates. Definitely won't be going back."}
{"text":"Really, really good pizza.  Can I say it I again?   The pizza is awesome. Cute little place near home and yet somehow we haven't tried before.  Garden salads were huge...you can split. Hubs and I both ordered personal thin crust. They have Broaster chicken which looked amazing and everyone raves about.  We will order next time.  Service is cordial if not overly friendly.  This is a seat yourself kind of place and very busy. The staff are running like crazy to keep up. We will be back and often."}
{"text":"Great choice for a large group.  We had a party for 25 adults and 6 kids come together quickly last weekend.  I wanted o get pizza (easy) but it needed to taste good and I wanted a place that could make 6 pizzas at once - giving them the best chance to be good and be warm.  Streets was the right choice."}
{"text":"My second time coming here, both times I just came to get to-go orders. Both times I've been greeted immediately and the staff has been super nice. She even remembered me from last time. Busy place but the service is worth the bit of a wait. Our new regular spot. Can't pass up on good service and good food."}
{"text":"Extremely upset as well as disappointed in this restaurant tonight!  We have been coming here on and off for almost five years and have ALWAYS had good service. Tonight we came in and although we were seated right away, we waited 10 minutes and were not acknowledged at all even tho one blond waitress looked straight at us and completely ignored us!  The place was almost empty so we were hard to miss.  No excuse for such BAD service. We left telling the host that we had not had ANY service.  He said sorry about that and went right in with what he was doing.  Complete ignorance of a very young staff.  Too bad, so sad.  Probably will not return to this location again.  An aside....in the midst of their renovation of the place they should probably look to renovate the staff!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. Couldn't find a place that match NY pizza out here and now I found it! Must go to spot for pizza"}
{"text":"I ordered the chocolate cake and let me tell you, it was the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake that you've ever seen."}
{"text":"I ordered a thin crust margherita pizza to go while I was at an event in the surrounding plaza. Not only did it come out quickly but it was super tasty! Crust was nice and thin and evenly cooked, the toppings weren't overwhelming. Overall a very tasty pizza, I will visit here again when i'm in the centennial village area to try something else."}
{"text":"Pizza, bread and service were very good. The server was very attentive without being annoying. The pizza was pretty oily but very tasty. The bread pieces and dipping sauce were good."}
{"text":"Bread for the sandwiches taste terrible, the pizza is awful, service sucks. If you see this place keep driving as a matter of fact try not to even look at it. It just ruins my appetite every time I do."}
{"text":"We will never be back. Too many episodes of poor hostess service, out of control customers (children specifically and lazy parents) and ridiculously OVER priced food. We had a medium GF pizza-pepperoni, sausage, black olives and mushrooms, a small Greek salad, 1 tiny glass of cheap wine and 2 small beers. Grand total....OVER $60.  And the restaurant and bathrooms were filthy. #overit"}
{"text":"I have been to this place now a few times and each time , I've had great service and when something wasn't great, they fixed it immediately. I know folks make mistakes but as long as you make it better then I am cool :) The food is excellent and I will go back :) Thank you :)"}
{"text":"I came here on a Wednesday and the server was kind. Also the food was on point so i don't see a reason not to give them 5 stars"}
{"text":"We ordered take-out from here. I always have great things to say about their customer service. They are the nicest, most accommodating people, but I don't have such great things to say about their food. Here are the things I've had from there in the past month and how I feel:

Chicken Parm - Don't do it. You're better off making it at home. The sauce is bland and the chicken is dry.

Margherita Pizza - It's doesn't taste bad! It definitely doesn't taste like a margherita pizza though. 

Wings - Their honey hot sauce is a favorite among my friends. I enjoy their suicide sauce. It's called \"suicide\" sauce for a reason, so if you're not a spicy food eater, don't do it. Order boneless because their bone-in wings are soggy.

Garlic cheese bread - Again, you can literally through cheese and garlic on toast and make this at home. 

Overall, their pizza does its job! I guess I don't really discriminate when it comes to pizzas. All sizes, toppings and types work for me."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Right next-door to my favorite cigar place. Super friendly staff.  Always stop in for fast and good food."}
{"text":"I love some street of New York pizza  they have never let me down. I like the frank Lloyd Wright and 101 and greenway and Tatum location are the best ones thank you for your years of fulfilling my family And Friends pizza needs"}
{"text":"We don't have many options in Anthem... So   Us being pizza lovers we get delivery here a lot. They always forget our dressings for salad or ranch for the wings. When I spoke to the delivery boy about this he really could not give two shats and made that very obvious. Going into the restaurant is not much more pleasant. Kids are running it and it's filthy! They are standing around talking and we had to ask for dinner bread, they didn't offer because they were to busy doing nothing. Food takes forever and it's just ok... They need adults who give a crap to run this place, not high school children who don't care."}
{"text":"We used to like streets but this location is very inconsistent sometimes good but most times they miss the mark so we just don't go there anymore."}
{"text":"BEWARE!!!!  I just got off the phone with the 7th Street restaurant and the gal on the phone said their salads are a mix of iceberg and ROMAINE!!!!  It comes already mixed so they can't separate the two kinds. There is a huge WARNING out by the Center for Disease Control this past week and currently for everyone to toss out their ROMAINE due to an E-COLI contamination.  Many people in many states have gotten very sick and some have died!  It's linked to lettuce from Yuma,AZ!  After finding out they are still serving it, I cancelled the salad part of our order and asked to speak with the manager to see if she knew where theirs came from.  When the gal taking the order (who had no clue about this) came back to the phone, she said the manager had just left. I said \"You know people are dying from this, right?\"  She replies \"I don't know. I just work here.\"  Not playing Russian Roulette with my life and health!!!!    Can't believe the risk this restaurant is taking!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza was good here. The servers were nice. Don't love it! But definitely don't hate it!"}
{"text":"I usually just order there food for lunch. I LOVE their white pizza with garlic shrimp and the white garlic chicken. I order their wings suicide hot, and while they are not \"suicide\" by the mere definition, they are very delicious. They put fresh jalapenos in there as an added bonus. Me likey. I also really, really like their turkey sandwich and their philly cheese steak is the bomb! I am eating their antipasto salad right at this very moment and am very pleased. YUM! Their delivery is super quick and the drivers are ALWAYS SUPER NICE! I have ordered from quite a few different locations around the valley and they have all been very consistent and down right tasty! Kudos Street of New York! I am a fan. Oh yeah, I also like the fact that they are a local company and do a lot of sponsorships for local kids teams... that is always super refreshing to see!"}
{"text":"I wish they would cook their pizzas correctly.  They are typically under-cooked with barely heated toppings, slightly melted cheese and crust that is saturated with moisture and occasionally bordering on being raw."}
{"text":"Great! For what it is it's perfect. Nice environment, friendly staff, awesome food, family friendly. Had the passion bread and a cheese pizza with two of us and was very satisfied!"}
{"text":"Love the pizza! Service needs to be improved. I had a large order for a party and asked for a few ranch dressings on the side. They told me it would be $.50 per dressing (I only wanted 4!!!) I can't believe they would nickel and dime a long time customer! I will rethink my options next time. If I was not ordering for a party, I would have cancelled right then!"}
{"text":"I was craving a pizza and I ordered by phone and this one satisfied my cravings,  thin crust and delicious,  the person that took my order Julio was super friendly."}
{"text":"I have been to several Streets of New York locations around the valley and haven't had a bad experience at any of them,  and this one was no different.  They have one of the best cold roast beef sandwiches, they are super liberal with the portion of meat and the bread is always very fresh. The wings are meaty enough to order as an entree themselves or great to share. Once you are finished with all of the food you can order up some cheesecake for dessert! Overall this is my go to place when people are looking for a variety of food that all tastes good but still friendly on the wallet."}
{"text":"Had lunch delivered to the office today.  It was a half-hour late.  The meatball sub was decent but squished. The $5 cookie was blackened and burnt.  I'm embarrassed for them."}
{"text":"Decent pizza, a glass of Amber Bock, and a garden salad. I'm in early, so the lady is happy to have something to do. Because I made it in before 4 pm, the lunch specials are still good. Yay!"}
{"text":"Saw this place while I was driving home and decided to just stop by and give it a try. I'm ALWAYS on the lookout for great pizza places and was pretty excited to try it out. I arrived about an hour before closing. The staff were in the process of greeting and the hostess was sitting at the bar, reading a book but gave me a warm greeting when she saw me. I asked her a few questions about when they opened and how they prepared their food and she was very helpful in answering all my questions. 

After browsing I just ordered a small Cheese Pizza topped with onion and peppers and a Caesar salad to go. The restaurant seemed very spacious and clean and she offered me a drink while I waited for my food. 

The service was nice but the food was just okay...The crust was made nicely but there wasn't enough marinara on the pizza (it seemed bland anyway). And I just wish there were more toppings on the pizza too. The salad didn't seem that fresh and they hardly gave me any dressing for it. The food wasn't terrible by any means but it was just whatever. I probably wouldn't go back for their pizza but I'd like to try a few other things on the menu and see how they fair."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch had the two slice pizza special, yummy and filling couldn't finish second slice. The room is very inviting and seems like a good place for football viewing. friendly service from start to finish. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My girlfriend two other groups and i waited to be seated for 10 min.  Only to find that it was self seating.  

The tables were wet.  Asked two people to dry them.  They ended up song them selves.  

Sat waiting and waiting we no service.  

  The 2 two other groups we walked in with, one stayed and was served before us and the others walked out. The table that walked out got a new customer and they got their drinks and place their orders before we even met our waiter. =/ no bueno

15-20 min went by before before or waiting came to the table.

Of course I asked to speak to a manager but she is out doing deliveries. 

My girlfriend I have eaten here before have had decent service. I don't know if they've changed managers or what. This pretty much ruined my evening and I'm contemplating walking out. The restaurant looks pretty busy and I believe it's overwhelming. Our waiter is the assistant manager. And I understand that he's busy. But I believe its poor management that has the restaurant understaffed."}

The menu was jammed packed with items that sounded so good it took me forever to decide on something. I haven't been so happy about a dinner in a long time. I HAD to yelp about it. I will be telling everyone to come here and try the beef sandwich. Delizioso!!! Cannot wait to go back and try the pizza!!"}

I always order the Baked wings and gluten free pizza.  Very good.
Most of the time I order take out so I am not sure how the staff is.
When I do pick up food the staff is very pleasant and friendly.
I recommend"}
{"text":"Let me start off saying I'm Italian raised in nj, I kno good Italian food. I should have read the reviews first :( Delivery time took about 1 hour 25 min and considering what I ordered was a bit long.. I ordered two cheesesteaks.. They should have it on their menu as grilled or warmed roast beef.. Sorry excuse for a cheese steak. Wings were supposed to be \"honey hot\" all they were was hot wings with red pepper flakes. And last but not least the hot dog buns with cheese they call garlic bread ew. Don't waste your money order Pizza Hut. Don't kno how place has been in business lol"}
{"text":"Positives: Excellent wait staff. Spagehtti n meat balls were great.

Negatives: We ordered chicken wings dry, but they came out with too much seasoning. We thought dry meant nothing on the wings. Waitress told us that they season the wings before cooking them and bake them twice before serving.

Ate here before and had great meal m service. But today was only worth 3 stars because of the wings."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and amazing food. Honey hot wings are the best, cheesy passion bread is a must! Create your own New York pizza is my favorite! Gotta get dessert! Double chocolate cake or passion cookie, or both!"}
{"text":"Native of long island NY this place makes a great Margarita their regular is so so. Overall 4 star. Pricey. They call their garlic knots passion bread or some shit. Didn't try them."}
{"text":"Im incredibly surprised to read all of the poor reviews this location has received because I've experienced nothing of the sort. This location is one of their newest & is therefore not as busy as the rest. Because of that, I feel that I always receive prompt service and never wait for a table. Over my several visits I've gotten to know the staff a bit & they recognize us whenever we come in. 
I love that they offer some \"fancy\" salads on their menu. In the summer, the summer berry salad is the bee's knees. The rest of the year the gorgonzola pear salad is delicious! Their lunch plates are good sized & reasonably priced. And they are nice enough to let me order off the lunch menu during dinner. 
Beers are cold, dessert is good, wings are delicious (i ask for mine extra cruelt), they don't get all crazy if you ask for extra ranch, and the bread basket is great to nosh on while you wait for your meal. 
Good place, family atmosphere, give it a try!"}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER FOR DELIVERY! It took an hour for my food, which was understood since it was a Friday night at dinner time. We ordered 2 sandwhiches a #7 and a chicken Parmesan , 2 salads, and canolis. $50
When we finally had the food delivered, we only were given the salads and canoli. We were so excited and so hungry I was so irritated that we had to call and wait another 20 minutes for my food to come back. When i opened my sandwich, the chicken Parmesan, the chicken was obviously old, and was too hard to enjoy. The bread was hard as a rock, and it was literally inedible. The #7 was ok. The bread was super hard as well. I barely touched my salad. There was too much brown lettuce and it was soggy before I even put dressing on it. 

The canoli was not good either. It was just covered in nasty hershey syrup. My 8 year old who eats anything wold not eat more than a bite. I would NOT recommend ordering from this place. It was a huge waste of $50. I could have paid less, and had better food from dominos (which I don't enjoy ordering from) If you live in this area and want a good sandwich or pizza, go to rosattis. Its around the same price range, but I have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I have ordered twice from Streets of New York - once for pickup, once for delivery. Their pizza is AMAZING. We get the largest size plain cheese pizza and both times have been so impressed. It's cooked perfectly and just tastes delicious. 
The Greek salad and tossed salad are both big and have a good variety of veggies. If they added a few more veggies it would improve the salads- there could be a few more toppings compared to the ample amount of lettuce. 
Our delivery order was super fast and accurate. 
This place should def be on your go-to list for pizza in the southwest area."}
{"text":"returned for lunch again but this time with yelp on the mind-i took pics :) those free garlic knots? SO GOOD, the marinara is YUMMY! ordered a ten inch THIN CRUST supreme this time and it did not disappoint. That's two different types of pizza now, both really good. Will be returning for sure."}
{"text":"The pizza is ight. Not my favorite. Came in for $1 slice day. It's $1.75 per topping. The slices are huge. Rays pizza is better."}
{"text":"Visiting Scottsdale, ordered two pizzas that cost $48... Worst friggin pizza my family and I have had. It took them an hour and a half to deliver. My mother in law called and they only took off $8 as an apology, the guy on the phone didn't even know where the delivery guy was. Poor service, poor food. Waste of money."}
{"text":"We only go for pizza about twice a year and this is the only place we go.  We have always had great food and great service.  Most people seem to take drive thru pickup or delivery so the inside is usually quiet and clean with great service.  (We have never done delivery service from this location)"}
{"text":"I like this particular location of this restaurant.  The parking is a little odd but there is enough.  It is just east of See's Candies.

It is a fairly large restaurant.  The serving staff are all quite young.   They have always been friendly and attentive since the first time I went there. Their food is pretty good and plenty of it for reasonable prices. It is a larger restaurant than you'd expect.  Maybe that is why we went there and were seated right away there on a Friday night after finding a forty five minute wait at five other places.  It may not be a gourmet place but I can't complain.  It fills me up. Their pizza is good if you heat it up the next day.  it has an upbeat atmosphere and I have never had to wait for a table at this location.."}
{"text":"By far, Hands down, the BEST pizza we have ever had! We LOVE this place, fantastic food, amazing service, atmosphere is awesome, especially now with MLB on every TV. We love their pie, beer, and now funnel cake - What's that you say funnel cake? Yes I did say funnel cake, and it is glorious! 

I am not sure why all the bad reviews, because this place is the BOMB- Diggity! We have NEVER had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"We were there with a big party.  I think just poor organization and poor management.  It should not be too difficult.  Management should recognize guests.  Just a very poor experience.  Food came out at various times.  The appetizer came out last.  A single piece of cheese pizza took 90 mins.  Just sad."}
{"text":"I felt like pizza so this was closest stop. Haven't been here in a really long time so decided to give it a whirl. The board outside said 2 slices and a coke for 4.50. Sign said seat yourself. Ordered a water to drink, was a toss up between a sandwich or pizza/wings. Decided to go with special. Server comes over I ordered she said the special is actually 4.95 not 4.50, well then change it. Anyways not a big deal, she didn't ask if I wanted a
Coke I'm assuming because she seen my water. Food came out and it looked good. I was disappointed that the crust was too doughy and may have ruined the extra cheese experience. Meh...not rushing back.."}
{"text":"I had two slices of cheese pizza. It was so gross. Extremely greasy and the cheese was completely burnt. There was barely any sauce and it just didn't taste good. I'm wondering if whoever cooks the pizza has ever tried it because it's the worst pizza I've ever had. Our server was extremely sweet and nice though."}
{"text":"So Delicious! We ordered in and gorged ourselves on crunchy yet chewy crust, golden brown cheese, and spicy pepperoni slices. Definitely will call them again; looking forward to dining in too! The place is adorably traditional from the outside. More? Yes please!!!!"}
{"text":"I can definitely say that I have never been so anxious to write a review (positive or negative). The experience hubby and I just had was one of the most ridiculous ones we have had in awhile. So hubby got there first and placed order for us at 6pm (we were in time crunch so made note of the time to be sure we had enough time to order a pizza). I arrived at 6:15 & he had still not received the drink he ordered and said that the servers and manager (which turned out to be the owner and makes this experience even worse!), had walked past his table many times and never brought his drink or offered bread like they did to all other tables. When I sat down at the table, no one ever came up or asked to get me a drink etc. This place has about 7 tables with our table being next to cash register so clearly we weren't unnoticed. I asked the owner if he could get his drink and expressed that it had been 17 minutes. The owner doesn't offer to get the drink or apologize, but makes an irritating situation worse by saying sarcasticly \"oh it wasn't 16 or 18 minutes?!\" & begins to laugh at me. I could not believe it. I asked if he was the manager which is when he arrogantly said he was the owner and I said well, that's worse. I am a business owner and first of all would never speak to a customer in a condesending or sarcastic way and certainly not because a patient customer politely asked for the drink they ordered almost 20 min prior. He literally walked away rolling his eyes and laughing at me when I was speaking to him. I hope that this review saves other pizza lovers from a dinner that is ruined by poor service and an owner who treats his customers so poorly. It literally ruined my night. I don't know what the reason was why my husband was totally dismissed or treated different from the other customers. Nor do I know why the staff also did not want to greet me or get me a drink, but at the end of the day, those things were just small annoyances we would have totally let slide if it weren't for the owner's comments and actions which are completely inexcusable. There are too many other restaurants with hard working business owners who have integrity, for us to have to support a place that doesn't treat their customers with respect."}
{"text":"I was there approximately a month and a half ago, stopped by to grab two slices of pizza with my daughter first of all I paid $9.75 for two slices of crappy Pizza, that had broken pieces of plastic fork in it, that was inedible and it tasted like sand unfortunately I had taken it to go, and couldn't return it. I called the manager and indicated that the pizza was inedible, fortunately the sliced my daughter ate was fine. I will never go there again $9.75 for two slices of pizza and a drink? In Phoenix the going rate is $5 or less, how do these guys charge so much for crappy product? Worst service ever Rude Girls too busy to take your order ignored me, and took a take out order in front of me before taking my order, as well. Very unprofessional very inattentive staff, and rude people serving horrible food.
There was literally pieces of plastic fork in the pizza under the cheese. Disgusting, if I could give it zero Stars I would"}
{"text":"I was really sad to see such bad reviews for this place after our visit because we had an excellent experience. Denise is an amazing server, our daughters just loved her, and she went above and beyond for us. There were only two servers on and she was rocking it. Food was great, no complaints here. Will be back on our next visit to Fountain Hills!"}
{"text":"Will never eat here again. Had dinner there and found a little roach cooked into our pizza. Absolutely disgusting. They refunded the cost of the pizza. But this pizza place left a bad taste in my mouth (no pun intended)"}
{"text":"My Fiancé and I went here for dinner one night we had no clue whether we seat our selves because we were ignored finally we were seated and giving one menu instead of two. We place our drink order and food order. When our food came we asked if we can get water. 20 min later still no water. I would have understood he was busy but he came to the table next to us twice and ignored us. I called him over asking him where our water he said it on the counter and it'll be right out. In the 10 min it took to \"bring it right out\" I saw him texting on his phone and stand behind the counter doing nothing. My fiancé like his food thought mine was ok. But for real 30min for water, dude get off the phone."}
{"text":"Went in today for a quick lunch.  My wife ordered a pizza slice and I had the pastrami sub.  Our food arrived in good time and was delicious. Our server was excellent and very friendly.  I only ate half of my sandwich, and requested a container to take the other half home with me.  And then left the restaurant without my leftovers.  After we got home and I realized my mistake I went back to see if I could still get my sammich.  As I walked in the server recognized me and remembered I had forgotten my food.  But, alas, it had been discarded before I got there.  No worries, they said, and they made me another half sandwich to take home, and gave me a soft drink to have while I waited.  This is excellent customer service, and Streets of New York has my business. Thanks!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in Fountain Hills.  That's all you need to know.  Ok, that and they have a few local beers from SanTan which is awesome, too."}
{"text":"Just wanted to update my last review.  Since then, Streets of NY contacted me and offered my a gift card which I accepted and used towards a new order.  I have to say, I am very happy with the way they handled my situation and the food and service have been great since then.  Thanks Streets!"}
{"text":"Great spot for a salad, wings, and pizza. The staff is very friendly! Jason the GM will really attend to you dine in needs. I really recommend this place if your looking for good food with a home type environment.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"All in all, I'd say this was pretty darn good visit. Our server was super friendly and patient with my \"elderly\" father-in-law who is quite needy when it comes to his pizza and drinks. 

My son and I shared the DBacks Triple Play which is sausage with carmelized onion and sweet red pepper. It was delish--though I will dare say that it's better when you have it at Chase Field with a beer and watching the Dbacks live..but I digress. My husband had the #1 which is a sandwich called Still The One. Father-in-law had super thin crust sausage pizza and mother-in-law had some sort of chicken dish. We were all pleasantly pleased with our choices and as mentioned, our server was excellent. 

I am definitely thinking another visit to SONY will need to take place soon! Thanks for the great visit!"}
{"text":"So last minute pizza ! Fried chicken ! Are u kidding ! Get your munch on' I wanted chicken he wanted pizza ! Well ! Go to streets !"}
{"text":"Another visit but better results. Different server this time and he gave a good amount of attention, the lunch order was perfect, he explained the optional bread and I left with a full belly. 

Slow on the out-going process but by that time it was 12:15 and he was getting busy. Good lunch overall."}
{"text":"We enjoy eating here, but lately have discovered the broasted chicken, which makes for a tasty take home meal for those nights we don't want to cook.  The chicken is crunchy and juicy and the potato wedges are also good"}
{"text":"Aubrey was not the first time I had a date at Streets of New York.  (See Aubrey date at SNY on 6730 E Thomas Rd in Scottsdale.)  In May 2007, I had a date with Sara.  Normally, I love Streets of New York, but this location was not very good.  Go to any of the other locations.  The pizza tasted like cardboard.  Just kidding, it was better than Domino's!  I told her that the pizza is normally better, but this location isn't very good.  She reassured me saying it was good, which was the right thing for her to say since it was our first date.

Like Aubrey, Sara was a great date as well, but she was kind of weird.  I didn't try that hard to pursue a second date."}
{"text":"Love Streets of New York.  It's one of my favorite pizza places in the Valley.  I had an awesome first date here on 2/1, which led to four more dates with Aubrey.

'And Aubrey was her name.  A not so very ordinary girl or name.'  Like the Bread song, I met Aubrey two weeks before Valentine's Day.  Ironically, our conversation online was mediocre.  Like an idiot, I told her, 'I don't think we'd be a good match.'  Talking more, I suggested a date going to a Haiti fundraiser dinner at Streets of New York.  My attitude was nothing to lose, probably an average date and great pizza.  Our date well exceeded expectations.  We clicked on everything and stayed over two hours.

I'll always associate this location of Streets of New York with this date."}
{"text":"Great pizza, salads, and subs. I would come here at least once a month to enjoy the food. The only reason I haven't is because I no longer have transportation and money is tight. Everyone was really friendly too."}
{"text":"I order 2 pizzas and the beer batter apitizer today. The pizza wasn't that great and the beer batter apitizer was soggy. I can't believe I paid 40$ for this pizza."}
{"text":"They got 5 stars. Kind people help you from start to finish. The place is extra clean. The food is great. The management invited me back to dine & unwind.  And I'm so happy that I took time to revisit this location. The waiter is kind a like forgetful jones...but the over all visit was great. Did I add the food is great! You have to have this pizza."}
{"text":"Baked wings and thin and crispy crust for your pizza... if ya gotta have it and you're on a diet, go here.

For the wings having been baked, I was surprised at how tasty they were.  I expected them to be a little soft and chewy, but nope.  I would have never known they didn't fry them.

Service was pretty good, pretty dead in there tho.  I guess that's what happens when you are way too far north from Phoenix."}
{"text":"My first time here and I am a fan! The service was really good. It must be if I am mentioning the service before I mention how tasty the pizza is.

I came here during a non peak time. Had ample places to choose to sit. Including inside or outside.

I wasnt extremely hungry but wanted something to eat. I ordered the Italian Wedding Soup. Cup sized portion. And the New York Combo pizza since they boasted that this was their original and what they were known for. 

The cup of soup arrives in a large bowl. I mention to the server that I ordered a cup of soup. She tells me this IS the cup and that you should see the bowl it is a lot larger. Uh oh! I still have some pizza coming. 

The soup was excellent. With the right amount of flavor and little meatballs.

The pizza arrives. It looks amazing. I ordered in with thin crust. Because I like to taste the toppings and not the dough. The New York comvo has a variety of toppings, sausage, salami, veggies, cheese and a sweet tomato sauce. I managed to eat some of the pizza. Boxed up the rest. When I was ready to leave, my server went a step above in the customer service area and asked if I wanted my drink to go. It was only water but she brought me a large take out drink. Normally at restaurants you have to ask for your drink to go. Not here! 

She had done this same thing for other tables too. So not only was the food delicious and memorable so was this type of service.

I probably would have given this 5 stars..but the restaurant's decor was on the older comfortable side. The parking was ok. And there was a drive up window that I am not sure that they use. And I when I arrived and left there was a homeless man hanging out. He had even come inside the restaurant while I was there. He was really harmless, I gave him my leftover pizza. Which he was greatful for."}
{"text":"Best staff, manager, service and food.  We came here for a soccer dinner to host our team of 35.  They were very hospitable with our orders, drinks and took care of everything.  Food was fantastic!  Kudos to the manager and her team for a great experience!!! Thank you and we'll see you again!"}
{"text":"I decided to give them a try even though there are a lot of bad reviews for them here. 
I have yet to find the perfect Pizza in my area of Glendale, AZ so I wanted to try them out.
I thought the pizza tasted great but my family wasn't really impressed. But they think Pizza Hut is good so what do they know? (wife + kids). 
The delivery was on time or even a little earlier than the website predicted.
I think the pizza tasted better than Luna Pizza etc.
I'll probably order from them again."}
{"text":"figured i'd try something new and ordered pizza and a philly cheesesteak from ubereats.  my delivery person was great!!  food not to much.  the philly cheesesteak was very tough.  i noticed there was a lot of tendon in my sandwich, very off-putting to eat.  the pizza was okay, there are better pizza joints out there.  wouldn't recommend this place to friends and family."}
{"text":"Good pizza, pleasant staff, cold beer--everything you could want in a good pizza joint. Nice to get seated right away and although the restaurant was busy, the staff wasn't frazzled or indifferent at all like they get at Grimaldi's. We are definitely going back and I'm looking forward to it."}
{"text":"Haven't tried the pizza but ordered pasta. It was so good taking my family to the location to see how good it is in person.."}
{"text":"Heard a lot about this place, glad I finally know what I need to. Great pizza (good crust, good chew, toppings that stay on the pizza, well seasoned), good apps (antipasto salad), and complimentary garlic Parmesan bread.
Side note: tastes great the next morning too, which is a good test of great pizza."}
{"text":"The thin crust pizza is your typical New York thin style, and was pretty tasty.  The crust has a garlic-buttery taste to it, which was a nice surprise.

The pizza is good, but it's NOT what I come back for time and time again.  Their \"New York Cheesesteak\" is FANTASTIC!  I'm a big fan of all forms of meat/cheese subs from various places, and this one is pretty unique.  A french rolled filled with very tasty meat, onions, mushrooms, and an alfredo/gravy sauce...all sealed in the bread by some provolone baked on top.

The place is big and clean, and the location is easy to get to(only a block off the 202).  I've only been there during lunch hours, so I can't comment on the dinner experience."}
{"text":"Really good pizza! I ordered the \"combo\" on recommendation from a friend, and it has a whole lotta stuff on it and is very good. We tried the \"thin crust\" version of their pizza, and we found that a bit too thin. The regular thicker dough is awesome. Also great wings, we ordered them \"hot\". They were quite good, the wings themselves are more seasoned than hot, but the hot sauce finishes them nicely. On a separate day I ordered delivery versus pick-up on a Friday night, and delivery was pretty quick. Also, they offer a 15% discount for military (thank you!). Very good pizza! I'll go back again!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of their pizza pasta and omg the bread so good! Definitely great place to get some dinner or lunch!! I wish they delivered though!!"}
{"text":"We loved their artichoke dip, it was creamy and delicious. I didn't try the pizza...which is a bit odd of my since this is a pizza place, but I filled up on garlic bread and spinach dip....my boyfriend liked it though. Their salads are good also. Will definitely come back, or even better, get delivery :)"}
{"text":"Ate there today. Not only was the food good but they had Shiner Bock on tap and the manager, as I perceived him, was great. Definitely will return"}
{"text":"The baked hot wings and bread the bring out were really good. The Hubs said the meatballs were also good but the pizza was lacking. We got separate slices instead of a whole pizza; plain cheese for him and mushroom for me. The pizza itself didn't have much flavor and the mushrooms, while fresh, had a kind of dirt aftertaste. Won't be back for the pizza but the wings were great."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and our waitress, Lacey was outstanding. Store 21 is the best SoNY by far. Thank you."}
{"text":"We have been somewhat of regulars here for the past 2.5 years. We usually go about once a month. However, this time was horrible and might keep us away for awhile. They seem to be sliding and getting worse over time. Our order consisted of nothing special...one 10\" pizza, one 14\" pizza, order of chicken, order of chicken basket, side salad, and garlic bread. It took awhile to get our order taken, and then it took an extremely long time to get the food. Only bright side was the food was good. They forgot to bring any of the appetizers until after the regular food came. We asked for a split bill and they gave us one. We hardly ever saw our waiter and had to ask for silverware."}
{"text":"I am staying in an hotel waiting for my new house to be inspected so I can move in. I've always loved streets of new York (for years now) so I am somewhat biased. the pizza is the best in az &the salads are pretty good as well! their also reasonably priced. I WILL ORDER AGAIN!!!         the second part of this is I have 2 service dogs and yesterday I went to an dr. apt and while I was gone someone let my dogs out. yesterday evening my large dog came back, but my small dog is still missing. so I asked if the delivery driver could look on the access road (when coming to me) for my dog scooter and was told sure. five minutes later the delivery driver called me to get more info on scooter because he wanted to look around for me. he then told me his wifes dog got lose not to long ago and was found by a stranger and brought home. this delivery driver Ned said he would drive around after work and look for scooter. I just started crying, you don't come across people like this everyday!! scooter is still missing but it warms my heart knowing Ned is looking for scooter! thank you Ned & streets of new York!!"}
{"text":"I guess I should've read the reviews before ordering online. I only get 30 minutes for lunch and I know this area can be a traffic nightmare, so I placed my online order almost 2 hours in advance. IT WAS STILL LATE! I finally called them and instead of an apology, they just blamed it on Barrett Jackson traffic. No $hit! That's why I ordered it 2 hours early. Now my food sits in the break room getting cold and gross because I didn't have time to eat it. Never again! There's several places in the area that have no problem getting here on time with traffic."}
{"text":"I always get cheese pizza.   I've tried toppings but they're always worse!  Just get the cheese pizza like a true new yorker and you'll be way more happy with your pizza. 

Also if you get it carry out after you order online,  be early!   They just want to be safe than sorry,  but nothing beats a pizza fresh out of the oven."}
{"text":"I tried this pizza place because it is one of the few that will deliver to my neighborhood. It arrived 10 mins earlier than expected. So much for the positive. It was a New York cheesteak pizza. The toppings did not come  close to covering the crust! It was like someone used the toppings for a much smaller pie. A whole lot of dry crust with nothing on it. The toppings that were there were clumped together, sauce in one spot and onions in another etc. Being on limited fixed budget makes blowing 30 bucks on a crummy dinner more than disappointing experience. Worst pizza I've ever had. My wife agrees."}
{"text":"It was our first time going and the service and people where wonderful. Food was fresh and wonderful. Will be going back soon."}
{"text":"Saturday was my first time trying streets of New York.  Just moved down the street from this location so we decided to try it after a long day of moving in the rain (THE ONE DAY OF THE YR IT RAINS IN PHOENIX)  We got a large pizza (spinach, artichoke and feta with alfredo sauce)  and 2 small salads. 
My salad was just ok ....  But that might just be because the pizza was SOOOO AMAZING!   The boyfriend said his Cesar salad was really greatIt is now in my top 3 favorite pizza places.  The guy who took our order was very patient with us as we took forever to decide what to get.
 I want to try their wings now after Alex P.s reviews.

The ONLY reason I didn't give 5 starts is because it is a little pricey.  But I will be back"}
{"text":"I was hoping for decent, New York style pizza. I should have known that with the exception of the New York Deli News in Denver, you should never trust a place with \"New York\" in its named to actually have New York style food (how many times did I just type New York?).

The sodas? Great, served in giant chilled glasses. The menu? Looked promising (although I was heart broken they didn't have an eggplant parm sandwich). The salad? Mediocre -- bring on the slices!

Sigh. Not even close. Not even good. On par with Papa John's I'd say. I mean, wow. It was CHEWY. Pizza is supposed to be crisp with sauce and cheese, NOT chewy, by any means.

Our server was nice. The place was cute. Perhaps we'd go back in a pinch and try the eggplant rollatini...but never again shall I eat the pizza. Oy."}
{"text":"I ate at this Streets of New York location tonight with two other people. We thoroughly enjoyed our 16\" pizza, along with the free garlic bites and marinara sauce. The pizza was perfectly cooked, with a generous amount of toppings. The pizza sauce had a great flavor, with just the right amount of garlic. Our server was friendly and outgoing. She made us feel welcome and provided excellent service throughout the meal. I would definitely return to this Streets of New York location. Their plant-lined patio is a nice bonus as well."}
{"text":"I have been back several times since my first (less that stellar) experience and am glad I did. I have had their \"Number 1\" sandwich, which is wonderful. I enjoy their \"new recipe\" lasagna VERY much. And I have tried their pizza which is also very good. I'm really glad that I gave this place another try. The shift managers Lori Beth and Kelly are SO nice!! I guess this just goes to show that any place can have an off night. I'll be back again!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, good service, easy to park."}
{"text":"Great food, family friendly atmosphere, exceptional service as well. Priced very reasonable. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Good pizza. big ass slices. music is kinda crappy. Wings are baked, never fried. military discount. Worth a visit, They also do a good job on takeout orders."}
{"text":"Love the food! Especially the pasta. Service could be a little bit better. The best part though is the pub trivia on Monday nights. It's always a blast."}
{"text":"The food here is decent. The bread sticks are really yummy! It is good for large groups. They deliver for $2.50. The pizza is big which is always a plus."}
{"text":"The only reason I didn't rate it five stars was because of the screwed up delivery. The food is delicious and they took care of me for messing up our order. 

#7 (the best of everything) is about the best sandwich ever."}
{"text":"I have had food delivered a few times and each time it has been perfect.  I like that you have the option to get garlic bread and salad with your pasta entrée.  The pasta dishes are delicious as are the salads and garlic bread.  Everything is very fresh.  Also the delivery person is very polite and personable.  It is a bit pricey, but an enjoyable once-in-a-while treat and is so much better than the big national chains."}
{"text":"I've been going to this restaurant (several locations) for over 25 years. It is reliable and has some great meals. I especially like the #7 Best of Everything sandwich.  I often order it for delivery but usually my order is incorrect. Usually I just go with it because it is too complicated to call and have them correct it every time   I leave notes every single time about the errors and asking that they double check order. It never matters --it is always wrong. I called a few times ago because even the pizza was wrong. (Wrong size and toppings). They corrected it because the other house got my order-- never adjusted price.  If I were running the restaurant I would want to make sure that the customer got the order they made.  I hope that they get their delivery system improved because I really enjoy the restaurant.  I actually do delivery orders weekly from the restaurant (probably about 20 times). The order has been correct about 4 times so there is a strong likelihood for a problem. Missing dressing, sides, or the wrong entree are common problems. I like the food and sometimes I just need delivery and the choices for restaurants that deliver are limited. The delivery people are VERY nice and I appreciate their good service."}
{"text":"Service was fast and friendly. Food not so great.  Ordered a Caesar salad it was terrible lettuce tasted like it was a day old and there was hardly any dressing.  Ordered wings they were ok but the vegetables were old and wilted. Bill was expensive at 12 for wings and 10 for terrible salad."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Streets for over 30 years, and the food usually doesn't dissappoint, however it has gotten quite expensive.  Especially considering the reduced portions. 

It seems like they have lost a step. Not sure where they got the idea for the \"Classic Caesar salad\" as it came with tomatoes and onions. 

$54 for two salads, one sub and an order of cheese bread, along with two iced teas seems a little high. For that I can do better elsewhere.  Makes me sad to say, but I won't  be returning."}
{"text":"This is our favorite pizza stop in the valley. Although we are fairly regular here now it's still a great place to just sit and relax with a slice. One of the things I liked most when we first came here was how quaint it was. Yes, it is small inside however the staff is always friendly and our orders are always out in a reasonable amount of time. 

  Parking is in back of the building and one of the downsides is the restrooms are accessed via the outside of the building instead of in the restaurant. 

  Our family will always call this location \"our Streets\" as our children have grown up coming here for a special slice of pizza."}
{"text":"I am beyond dissatisfied with the service at this location. I have spent average $35 a week plus $5 in tips every delivery.\" They got my order all wrong and is insulting for someone who has been loyal, consistent and nice to experience. I went off on the manager Amber today because she lacks listening skills and takes feedback personal. Bottom line is you screwed up....Own it and fix by customer expectations. I will never order from them again and this is easy as I have been on this Earth for 43 years and know how to walk away and not look back. Horrible customer service!"}
{"text":"We order regularly through Uber Eats. We love the meatball sandwich and antipasto salad. Some of the best in Vegas! Quality food and great prices. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Last night I ordered a large pizza with half cheese and half sausage plus a dozen wings, paid $41.00. Ridiculous!  The pizza was tasteless and the wings were basically free of any sauce (we ordered mild).  So very disappointed and will never return, way too expensive for the quality of what we got, I'd rather order from Dominos over this place. I didn't even want to give it one star."}
{"text":"I've been going here for lunches regularly for the last year in a half. The food is delicious! They don't make a fuss if you need a meal customized, and all the staff members treat guests to the best customer service! Good for both takeout and dining in."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner at Streets of New York with my family, this is a small neighborhood restaurant that pleasantly surprised all of us. Everything that we ordered was fantastic.  It made me wish that I had one in CA.  Our waitress \"Ginger\" was the best she took care of us from beginning to end. She went out of her way to make a fresh pot of coffee for our desserts.  I'll be back again and again"}
{"text":"Great pizza. Even better wings!!  Only downfall was 75 minute delivery and pizza was lukewarm. Delivery guy was great and so nice!"}
{"text":"Pizza & wings are delicious! We have ordered from here a few times and it is always good! Delivery is pretty quick too!"}
{"text":"Wonderful N.Y. style pies! We had them deliver 6 for a business lunch and each one was fabulous.  Meat lovers pie was a hit as was the mergherita pie. Thin crust and rich sauce just like you would find in NY or Boston. I definitely overindulged!  

We also order a salad tray I did not go near it but others did and and they said was good as well."}
{"text":"This is my first experience with streets of New York. Gotta say I love the Mediterranean pizza and the workers were EXTREMELY personable and helpful."}
{"text":"Thanks to Elissa we had great service & awesome meal! Yummy Italian food all the way around!!"}
{"text":"5 stars with ONE bad experience. We frequent S.O.N.Y. often and ONLY this location. We live near 2 closer locations but favor this one. To start my review I will tell of the bad experience.
 We went on a Friday before valentines day and it wasn't to packed. Our waitress was not concerned with us at all. We had to repeatedly ask her for refills. Repeatedly ask for dressing. She brought our food out at different times. My food, \"hot pastrami\", was so cold it turned into one big ball of a gross mess. A party of 2 came in after us and she spent the entire time SITTING at their table chatting. She must have knew them because she greeted them both with kisses. Thank God the other waitress was helpful or I would have left. If I went back and she was there I would ask for another section (wish I got her name, but I know her face) dreaded giving her a tip too. We tip well, not that night. 
We went back today for lunch. One waitress around 12pm and she was awesome!!!! 1 large pizza, suicide wings, hot pastrami, order of fries and 3 drinks. $55! Say what! GREAT DEAL! she was great and we tipped accordingly. Like I said we frequently visit this location and will continue too. 
I need to remember to give a review every single time we go. Of all the times, that one time was literally our only bad experience."}

Streets of New York 
9301 E Shea Blvd, Scottsdale, AZ 85260
(480)391-1900

Last night, November 1, 2016, my mother and I went shopping in North Scottsdale. After checking out at our last stop, we decided to get some food before heading our separate ways. Pizza and wings sounded great after a shopping extravaganza and we headed for Streets of New York that was located in the shopping plaza. Neither of us had been there before and we were delighted by the somewhat quiet atmosphere. With only two or three other tables in the restaurant, we were able to catch up and gossip in peace - stopping every now and then to enjoy our food and watch the Cubs game. We were both impressed by the cleanliness and style of the restaurant and how it wasn't your traditional, dirty and grubby pizza and wings sports bar. 
Our server, Denise, was knowledgeable, friendly and accommodating. She recommended different menu items and gave us plenty of time to make up our minds; Denise was very good at checking in without being overly annoying and obtrusive. We did end up ordering one of her suggestions - the White Pizza. The description alone made our mouths water and we decided to give it a try: garlic butter, mozzarella, ricotta, roasted garlic, Tuscan extra virgin olive oil and spices on a traditional hand tossed New York crust. We also ordered a small order of medium boneless wings to add a little bit of protein and spice; it also didn't hurt that they were on happy hour and they were only $3.75! Not long after we ordered, the wings were already done and at our table. They were presented in a white dish and had a little leaf garnish on the side - much different than we were expecting, but it was cute. The wings were absolutely delicious; real, fresh chicken and delicious, not too spicy, sauce. As fast as the wings got there, they were gone. When the pizza arrived, we both agreed that listening to Denise was the best decision we've ever made. It was cooked to perfection and looked and smelled incredible. It tasted even better - the mix of mozzarella and ricotta cheeses with the garlic and olive oil was a heavenly combination and was incredibly flavorful. 
Even though we chose Streets of New York because it was convenient, we both agreed that next time it would be intentional. Not only did we have exceptional service and excellent food, we received a pleasant surprise when our bill came. It was much less than we had expected; for wings, a medium specialty pizza and a glass of wine our bill was only $30 and some change! At similar restaurants in the Phoenix or Scottsdale area, you would pay much more than that, sometimes even twice that amount. After such good food and great service, we could not believe how inexpensive it was. We will most definitely be back. 
If you are in the north Scottsdale area and looking for an inexpensive meal without compromising the quality - stop in at Streets of New York!"}
{"text":"There is not much I can say about this place except that every time we've went it has been a pleasant experience. Their pizza is quite good, perhaps not the best in the world but still quite tasty. The one time I had an issue they promptly addressed it and even gave me a gift card.

What really sets this place apart in my mind is their wonderful broasted chicken. It is easily among the best fried chicken in Phoenix, they also have a great all you can eat deal on Wednesdays. The chicken is crispy and flavorful right until the last bite due to the marinade. If it has an issue it is that it may be too salty for the more salt sensitive people out there, but IMO, it is far from overwhelming, and each bite has a combination of flavors. We will be moving to a different state next year and will definitely miss this franchise, specifically this particular location. 

I've yet to have anything at this place I'd consider sub-par or average. Not to mention the fact that the atmosphere is very soothing and quiet every time we've went."}
{"text":"Great food! Thanks for the prompt service. The pasta and sausage were excellent. Is that enough?? Need i say more? Do you have a single Italian daughter? Does she like Harleys?"}
{"text":"My Logic tells me I should not like this pizza. 

I'm typically a New York slice snob.. and sometimes, I sacrilegiously enjoy a Chicago deep dish. And who could not worship an artisean Pizzeria Bianco? I've had really good pizza in Italy too.... 

This pizza is nothing like those.

It's heavy on the bread, it's got a chunky tomato sauce.. The cheese is definately American- more Midwestern without any attempt to make it taste Italian.

My DNA is more than half Italian, and my tastebuds should be offended at this bastardization. But.........

It's good. Really good. It is NOT New York pizza. Maybe I'm forgetting how truly good a new york slice is, but I really liked it. 

This pizza makes me wonder... If I were to move to New York.. and there were no good Sonoran Mexican restaurants.... After 3 years, would I think Taco Bell was divine?

(Their ingredients are better than Taco Bell, and it's obvious someone cares about how the product tastes. If the owner reads this- thumbs up.)"}
{"text":"Great food.  My kids love it.  Been coming here for over 30 years.   They have grown  but not lost their individual feel for food or customers.  Good neighborhood restaurant wherever you go in town.  Love Streets of New York!!!!"}
{"text":"We visited Streets of NY Pizza tonight for the first time. Atmosphere is a little confusing. You would think a NY pizza place would promote NY sports teams but there's Arizona gear hanging on the walls. Server was very nice but service was a little slow, even though there were only maybe 3 other tables in the restaurant. However, her kind attitude really made up for it. 
The pizza itself was really really good. Not quite the same as a pizza from NY but it was legit good pizza, and I don't even like pizza that much.  
About $50 for 2 pizzas and 2 drinks."}
{"text":"Quite tasty. I was impressed by the amount of toppings on the pizza, as it seems the more toppings listed the less toppings total end up on a pizza... but not here! They had a big menu, but we can for the pizza. I would go back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Today was a great reminder that the dine in and pick up great food industry still has the ability to deliver  both amazing food and service. Everyone makes boo boo's sometimes (customer end) and when ordering my favorite can I say delicious Mediterranean pizza (I'm a foodie and If you know about this GEM special \"your know the Mediterranean\" from the streets of the New York you are coming back and you may even do it in your sleep as you crave it in your dreams) I made the mistake online and ordered the margarita 

I called to cancel and modify my order and I just got the upmost service and stand out accommodations  I haven't encountered in years. I spoke to i recall her name, Amanda and told her the mix up; she immediately helped change my mistake order as I heard her in the kitchen have the cooks alter the order and coming back to me with a ease of \"no problem at all\" (alongside letting me know she is happy to help me and said my name). I honestly was taken away by good service like that, it's not often you get that anymore and getting something as simple as someone speaking to you and referring your own name. 

STREETS OF NEW YORK TATUM AMD GREENWAY IS ON MY 100 BEST LIST"}
{"text":"I came into the restaurant at 8:15pm on 1/28/2018. to place a to go order for 2 of the 10\" pizzas. The girl who took my order was very rude and didn't explain the different pizzas at all. She seemed more concerned about the Grammys on the TV rather than helping me as the customer. Furthermore, when I asked about the pizza specials, she didn't seem to care about telling me what they were. So after I placed my order, I noticed the monitor behind the bar show a Sunday pizza special for buy one get the second 1/2 off.  When I asked to have that special, she said \"the order has already been placed.\" The other girl took $6 off my order to reflect the special. Overall just rude college or high schoolers working there who didn't seem to care about the customers."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I have been at this venue several times but somehow a change of staff has taken place recently.  With this change, we had the worst service ever.  First, the server took forever to take our order.  Finally she took our drink order and after she brought it over, we asked for straws and artificial sweetener.  She never came back and finally one of us got up to get it and she was clueless and didn't care.  Then she took our order, made recommendations but she served this first.  They were wings, and it was cold and not as tasty as expected.  Our food took 45 minutes to arrive, (pizza and green salad), she messed up on the pizza.  Prior to serving, she forgot our orders, had to ask again what we ordered (perhaps if she wrote the orders down??).  She had an attitude and had this \"I Don't Care\" look.  Needless to say, we have not been back to Streets of New York because the service was awful, server was rude rude rude..."}
{"text":"Sat right away, drinks are large an made perfectly \"Arnold Palmer\" is the best! 
We ordered the fries appetizers sooo good! Breadsticks were fresh & soft. 
Garlic Chicken pizza was a nice change. Sundried tomatoes & crust make it great! I'd come back for that pizza alone! Service was friendly, fast & atmosphere was quiet enough."}
{"text":"As pizza is one of my favorite, I was excited to see that a new pizza joint opened close to me that offered gluten free. Well, that is the only gf option offered. The waitress knew little to nothing about the contents of each item and its ingredients. She ran back to the \"chef\" three times while taking our order to confirm whether or not certain items on the  menu were safe for me, like the salad dressings. To be safe, I ordered a salad with no dressing and made my own of oil, vinegar, and lemon.

We ordered the pear and gorgonzola salad that was NOT easy on the eye. The greens were old and wilted with brown edges. When tasting the salad, it wasnt any better. The pears literally came out of a can! The best thing was the candied pecans. 

Now for the pizza. My gluten free pizza came to the table way over done, as I had to scrape off the burnt around the edges. The crust is my favorite part but couldnt eat it because it was burnt.The pizza sauce was extremely bland and may have come straight out of a can. The best thing about their operation is they have candle-lit pizza stands that help to keep the pizza warm on your table.

Another plus was the cleaniless and spaciousness of the dining room, after all it is a brand new restaurant. Their happy hour consisted of $1.00 off all beers, draught or bottle. Although the waitress did not know much about the menu, she was nice and apologized for my burnt pizza with a smile. Sorry, we will not go back, even if they run a groupon. There is just much better competition out there that I would rather spend my money on."}
{"text":"The new pesto crostini is very good.

The thin crust pizza was good, only if it had less cheese and more flavorful marinara."}
{"text":"This is such a great place to grab a quick bite to eat! My boyfriend and I come at least 2-3 times a month and share a small white pizza, and best of everything sandwich. The service is always very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"It took them 2 1/2 hours literally to deliver my food! By the time I got my food it was cold, hard, and even when I went to reheat it, it was stale. When I called in both ladies I spoke to you were completely rude. So, I took my food back and the manager rolled her eyes and was smacking her lips as if I did something wrong. This completely ruined my first experience for streets of New York I will never ever ever order from this place again. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I just wrote a really negative review of how I was treated as a solo business traveller at a totally different restaurant, and that made me think I needed to balance that by actually writing a positive review - can't go through life dwelling on the negative, and I had a such a positive experience here that I should counter balance with this great review.

I came in here for lunch by myself - my server seated me and she was fantastic - excellent and personable and efficient with an infectious smile!  She was definitely a bright spot on a long day.

My pizza came in the right amount of time for a whole pizza to be cooked and it was perfect - extra cheesy and delicious.

I will definitely be back the next time I'm in this area!"}
{"text":"#7 Sub was really good. Wife had a salad. Service was good although there wasn't that many patrons at the time we went."}
{"text":"Eat here for lunch every now and again.  Was there recently and seemed like something changed.  Had 45 minutes before my next appointment down the street, figured I had time for a slice and salad.  Usually they knock out their lunch orders. The servers tend to be on the mature side, like it aint their first rodeo, take care of business. But now it's overstaffed, 3 servers, buss-boy? and a manager.  And even though it wasn't very busy the service was slow as a snail. Ordered Pepsi, got diet. Asked for no onions on salad. Server says, \"There are no onions on salad.\" Came with onions. \"Did you not want onions?\" Took full 45 minutes to get salad and slice of pizza. Then had to go up and ask for my check.  Oh yeah, and it's kind of pricey for lunch. See ya!"}
{"text":"I ordred a pastrami sandwich and it was excellent!  Delivery was quick and sandwich was top notch."}
{"text":"This is a great place for some pizza and wings. My most recent visit, I ordered a lunch special - a slice with garlic chicken, black olives, and roasted red peppers. The pizza was good, and the toppings were solid. It also included a half dozen wings, and I went with honey hot. The wings are pretty tasty as well, and just a little bit different from most places - maybe a little crispier. The breadsticks that came out early were also good.

This is definitely on my list for pizza, and with it being in delivery range, will be an option for days when I just don't feel like cooking or leaving the house."}
{"text":"Do not order from here, your order will ALWAYS be wrong and they will give you any number of outrageous excuses including disclosing an employee's medical information!!!!
I have ordered from this location multiple times and each time my order was wrong! On this particular occasion, I ordered over the phone to be sure (or so I thought) that my order would be correct... I repeated my order three separate times to the man on the phone... He read it back to me the first time and it was wrong so I repeated it again and he said okay... Got all of my info written down then repeated my order back to me wrong so I corrected him, then he told me my total, took my phone number and I hung up. My boyfriend gets to the restaurant for pick up and the bone-in wings I ordered are boneless and soggy. Instead of offering us those wings for FREE, the man at the counter says he can wake another 15-20 minutes for bone-in wings or take the boneless (yes as I said pay for them). My boyfriend gets to my place and tells me what happened, I'm outraged so I call and the man first gives the excuse that they are training new people... I ask why that would mean I repeated my order three times and it was still wrong then HE charged us for it? Then I got, \"Well we have delivery people filling orders and answering phones.\" So I ask why THAT would make a difference, especially when HE offered absolutely no fix for our problem except waiting longer for the food we actually ordered. Next thing I know the guy is telling me that the reason my order is wrong, is that they hired someone with a disability?!?! Seriously? Get out of here with all of your excuses! Don't blame someone's supposed disability for the fact that my order was wrong and you offered horrible customer service. That's completely outrageous and insulting to your customers AND the person working for you who supposedly has something going on? I'm not even sure I believe that excuse, it honestly just sounded like a reason he though I would take and drop he whole complaint?! If someone you are employing has special needs that make it harder for them to do certain jobs, either work with them on it or don't force them to use the phones. I cannot believe I actually had one of your employees trying to GUILT TRIP ME after my order was wrong, telling me about someone with a disability. That shouldn't even come up PERIOD and guess what! It is in direct violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, not just strictly my own opinion! I am completely disgusted with the service and your staff at this location."}
{"text":"We came here after a motorcycle ride to mountain Charleston and the service was amazing. We got the garlic fries for an appetizer and they were so good! The pizza itself, not so good. It's called streets of New York but the pizza was nothing like New York pizza. Growing up in Manhattan you learn what pizza is. It was good but not what I expected. If you're going to say you're like New York pizza, make it like New York's pizza."}
{"text":"Two things this place has no one in Vegas can beat... the wedding soup and the fried chicken! I truly mean this statement and no its not and exageration. I've literally never had better of either. The pizza is sub par, the free garlic knots are amazing and the beer is cold but that fried chicken!!!!  The atmosphere is awesome. Great place to view sports with and abundance of TVs but if you're looking for fine dining service don't be an idiot and know what you're getting into. It's not bad but it's not white linen either. Overall a great experience and I'll definitely be returning.... that chicken DOE!!!!"}
{"text":"Just okay nothing great I would expect more since they have been in Arizona so long you can find better"}
{"text":"This is just a bad place to eat period. I ordered a pizza and was told it would be ready in 20 mins, I showed up on time and asked for my order two of the employees huddled up really.quick and one went to the back the other said it would be a few mins. The other girl never came back up and the other girl was making a huge excuse about the register being locked. I know they never put my order in as the girl trying to unlock the register was playing with her phone more than trying to fix the problem. After waiting 10 mins I walked out and when I said I was she made no last ditch effort to save the sale other than \"are u sure?\" I would give this place a zero star and would never visit this site again."}
{"text":"Once a week we order Wings and pizza for delivery. I have to say their Honey Hot wings are one of the best!!! We always ask for extra crispy and they always make them just right. The delivery driver is always very kind and courteous. Their Tuna sub and side pasta salad is not bad at all=)"}
{"text":"I got a Groupon for this place and saw so many lackluster reviews I almost let it expire. Glad I didn't! Honestly I don't know what all the negative Yelp is about, food was good and the server, although a little inexperienced, was very friendly. If you're a gluten free person, the pizza was surprisingly good. I actually thought they may have made a mistake and gave me regular thin crust. I will be back."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken tenders, medium wings, Phily cheesesteak sub & chicken parm sub... everything was delicious! Definitely will order again! Delivery took about 40 mins and the delivery man was nice."}
{"text":"Welcome to the restaurant that does NOT value customers!
So i previously had a few bad experiences with this place including one in which they wouldnt honor their own free delivery coupons. :)

The last one just really did it for me. 
Ordered delivery pizza and wings totaling 27.00 and it was delivered within 45 minutes. But the pizza was wrong. I called the store and explained the situation. The manager said he couldnt send another pizza because he was not allowed to send a driver out for less than 15.00 minimum order. Really don't understand because my original order was 27.00 and the store made a mistake with my pizza. In the end i had no choice but to eat the wrong pizza since they would not correct their mistake. 

They finally lost a 4 times a week customer for life. Barros is down the street, they deliver, they care and its a lot cheaper."}
{"text":"I had not been here for a few years but glad that I decided to come back.  I had their penne pasta with meat sauce and it was a huge portion with great flavor.  I really like their red sauce, it had a lot of flavor and was rich.  My bf had their meatball sub which again was a huge portion and he liked it a lot.  Next time we come back we will have to try their pizza!  Great job and keeping up with the times Streets of NY!"}
{"text":"This place is totally fuck-witable!! (AND THATS A GREAT THING).

Before actually ordering delivery I checked out the menu first. Their menu was very easy to look a everything at a glance. I had to look over a lot of things considering I'm a vegetarian but even the meat lovers titles were intriguing. I give this place a four because The menu versus the actual check out they didn't have that egg plant pasta and I really wanted it but I settle for something else which was just as great when It finally came. 

Delivery fit the ETA time listed, and the delivery guy came all the way to my doorstep which made everything else perfect & found my apt without calling (I stay in like a 10 building apartment complex). I would've appreciated a confirmation of order to my email, (I mean the system did ask for my email) but i'm definitely going to spread the word about this place since I'll be attending GCU in the fall."}
{"text":"First time in and the Girls at the counter were nice and tool my order right away. Made sure it was what I wanted.  Did not take long had a beer. The Pizza was best I have had yet in the area.  Will be going back often and will tell my friends to do the same."}
{"text":"This place sucks completely unprofessional I ordered a certain type of food when I got my food an hour latter it was wrong I called to let them know and the girl that answered Jesenia was very rude and was not helpful offered no type of compensation I was told my food would be there within Im an hour a hour past I called back to find out a new order was never placed and I was told I would get a refund and I did not this was on the 12th it's now the 17th I've called and spoke with a assistant manager and she claimed she couldn't do anything and would pass them message on to the gm I still haven't revived a refund and no one has tried to contact me"}
{"text":"I've never had the pizza from SNY and probably won't, i'm just not that interested. Their spinach salads are pretty good. They did mess my order up by giving me greek salad dressing, instead of warm bacon salad dressing. I ordered the salad primarily for the WARM BACON salad dressing. We ordered pick up and didn't find out about the mistake until it was too late. The salad was still fresh.  Hmm, maybe I should've gotten the pizza. Today the staff was friendly, but I have experienced the rudeness some of the other reviewers mentioned."}
{"text":"It's unfortunate that the staff isn't more professional because the product is pretty darn good. Never friendly.....always just chatting it up behind counter while dirty dishes pile up.......more time on phones then talking with guests. Expressed my concerns before but nothing changes. Oh well lots of options."}
{"text":"Worst ambience and very rude people. I was in a hurry and forgot my pizzas togo after paying the bill. I was called in by a old lady who shouts across the street, not for forgetting the pizzas but for not writing a tip of 25%. She goes by saying \"why didn't you give me a good tip! I want to improve my service and for future references you have to give 25% of your bill as tip\". Why the hell should i tip her for a togo order. And on top of which i was in so much hurry that i forgot my pizzas even after i paid the bill. She didn't have that minimum common sense and she was shouting across the street. Terrible experience. And the food smells stale. 
Never will go there again. I recommend people not to go there and have bad experiences."}
{"text":"We have tried this place a couple times, always for take out partially because the dining hall is a bit dismal. But the food has been pretty good in a reliable way.

The ravioli is cooked nicely. Nice balance of sauce, meat and dough. Pizza ingredients are fresh. Try the full salad. So filling and crisp."}
{"text":"I usually don't enjoy streets of New York because of how greasy the pizzas usually are but at this location the pizza was actually great.  
I was visiting my parents when I went here and they eat here every Sunday after church..  I would eat here again when, not like other Streets of New Yorks when I only go when i have too.

The service is a little slow...
The building is nice and clean..."}
{"text":"Yummy!! Ordered a Number 13( cheese steak sandwich ) . So good , we also had the spinach artichoke dip.. It was awesome as well.

Not t the best atmosphere,  I suggest getting it to go."}
{"text":"Their pizza makes Papa Johns or Dominos taste like a 10/10. Boneless wings looked liked cubed chicken just sitting in a pool of some buffalo dressing. The fries looked and tasted like they were fried in a pan, one side was crispy other side was soggy. The name of this place couldn't be more wrong or Arizona just doesn't know east coast pizza. Consider a name change."}
{"text":"I've tried ordering 3 times now and the pizza never comes out good. I also payed extra for condiments never received by delivery driver on 2 occasions now. . 
I'm done with this place. Sorry."}
{"text":"Horrible service and bread was served old and stale. 
They have a lack of concern for customers."}
{"text":"My husband and I moved here from Ohio two years ago. He's originally from New Jersey and has been looking for that \"New York\" pizza. He said this is the closest he's tasted in Vegas and we've tried A LOT of pizza. It's in a great area with lots of parking and the staff was great."}
{"text":"So the food at this place is good. Well the sliced turkey sud. But when it came to delivery and internet ordering. Oh my god the incompetence of these people. After and hour, 15 mins after the food was suppose to be delivered (the order was 2 turkey subs and garlic cheese bread.) I called and was told that there was no delivery guy and if i can come pick it up that they would knock off 25%. But the foods not ready yet, how long does it take to make 2 subs. So i pick up the goods and damned if i didn't check the bag they didn't give me the 2nd sub. Ugh they never checked the order. If you have online ordering  you need to follow though. So with a second phone call and a second trip to the place and 2 hrs after the original order i FINALLY get home and eat. The only good thing i got was a free lunch.  For that I give them a 1"}
{"text":"I ordered a pepperoni and mushroom 10\" pizza - the size is perfect for two people or two meals. The traditional crust was not too bready and didn't overpower the pie. The mushrooms were fresh and the sauce was just right. My order was ready in less than 15 minutes as promised and the price was fair. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been going to this location for about 6 months and have always had great service. The food is good and the servers make a point to remember my name when I come in. We've even ordered lunch delivery to work and it comes as ordered and it's pretty quick. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I redeemed my pizza voucher from donating blood the weekend before, at this location which I hadn't been to before. Compared to other locations I've gone to, this was locker room-sized. If you're with a group and are claustrophobic, you might want to try another location. However, size aside, this was a nice location. Staff were very hard at work the time I was waiting, and cheerful as well, even with the tables filling up on a Friday night. Pizza was good, even after taking it to go, can recommend Streets of New York if looking for a local pizza chain!"}
{"text":"The pizza and wings here are amazingly delicious. Probably my favorite pizza in the Valley -- over Oreganos, Barros, Mellow Mushroom, and NYPD. I think it's the crust that I like the best here at Streets of New York. 

However, the pasta is not good at all here. I went last night and had the spaghetti, it tasted really plain, like a 6/10. Our service was great, though. The inside of the restaurant is decorated like the outside with street lamps and stuff along with a couple of flat panel televisions. 

So, no pasta for me but I will continue to order yummy pepperoni pizza and 16 honey bbq wings. Delivery drivers are fast and super friendly."}
{"text":"Went back for a second visit during lunch the other day. Husband and I both had the two piece light meat broasted chicken combo and a slice! The macaroni salad was awesome...close to my favorite in town. Food was excellent and server was very attentive! Will be returning and glad to have had a better experience this time! Bravo!"}
{"text":"DON'T ORDER DELIVERY FROM THEM! I've ordered from this place a couple times in the past year. Their food is tasty and something I crave every now and then. But after my most recent experience I don't think I will be ordering from them again. 

I placed a simple order of fries, spinach and artichoke dip, and kid's mac and cheese through GrubHub around 6:50 pm. I was quoted a prep and delivery time of 1 hour. Almost an hour and a half rolls by and no sight of the delivery. Called their sister store by accident, but they were nice enough to call the correct store and find out what was going on. The store stated that the delivery driver had already left and it would be there any minute. Mind you the store closes at 9:00 pm and I first called around 8:10-8:15 pm to check the status. 8:30 pm rolls by and still no delivery. I called the correct store this time and the guy on the other line apologizes and tells me the same thing. It wouldn't have been a problem if it weren't for the fact that they're located right down the street from my home! It's literally only a 7-8 minute drive from there to my place WITH traffic. 

Unfortunately for me, because I ordered through a third party and not directly through them, they couldn't refund me what I paid and what I tipped ahead of time. I didn't want a full refund anyways. Just wanted to remove the tip amount since I didn't feel like giving them extra money for a poor delivery service. The only option I had was store credit which I accepted for the heck of it. The delivery guy finally arrived just ten minutes before the 2 hour mark. There were no apologies from the driver for arriving so late. He just handed me the GrubHub paperwork to sign and off he went.

As expected, the food quality arrived slightly above room temperature. The spinach and artichoke dip tasted super sour and the bread it came with tasted stale. The mac and cheese looked and tasted as though they had left it sitting for awhile and then nuked it in the microwave before delivering it. It didn't even taste like mac and cheese. It was just penne pasta with a small amount of cheese drizzled on it. The oil from the cold soggy fries had seeped through the wrapper and immediately tore when I tried to take it out of the bag. Plus the drink that came with the mac and cheese wasn't even the correct drink and it was watered down by melted ice. It just seemed like they had made my food quite some time before the delivery was made and was just left to sit for awhile.

I've had better delivery experiences from Pizza Hut, and that says a lot with how crummy their deliveries are. Looks like that store credit is going to go to waste because I won't be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"AJ  was my awesome server when I came in for lunch around 1:30. He was attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. I'll come back just because I received such great service from him. 

Wings and slice lunch special was on point too. Love their pizza"}
{"text":"I've been ordering from this location for about a year. The food is consistently good. I've had a few mishaps along the way with things missing from my order but overall it's good."}
{"text":"Great slice with wings deal. Delicious pizza. Friendly staff. I work close to them so they give me a neighbor discount. 

I ordered the six wings slice combo. They bring an unlimited amount of delicious bread. I always leave full and happy."}
{"text":"I've been to other ones and the food is decent I went in here and it took them 15 min to even say hello after I sat at a table. I left and don't want to ever come back."}
{"text":"Do not order delivery from here. They are horrible. Told me my order was coming then said 2 hours later that they never got it . I bartend right around the corner and will be telling everyone not to go there"}
{"text":"We ordered Lunch at 10:40 am to be delivered at 11:45 am.  The Food finally arrived at 1:30 pm ice cold.  We were very upset.  They didn't make us pay for it, but it still ruined our day.  We will never order from them again."}
{"text":"The food was AMAZING (per usual). Best pizza and sandwiches on the North side of Vegas. 

One thing that was NOT amazing...that would be our waiter. I believe his name was Stirling.

 Everything started off okay as he took our order.... but apparently right after that his parents came in to dine as well.(as we heard him mention it to someone). That being said, he spent most of the time sitting in the booth with them. Our appetizer came out and we watched it sit on the counter as I could see his leg and shoe from around the corner at the booth with his mom and dad. 15 mins later, another employee checked the food and the ticket and graciously brought us out our food. Not once did he come over and check on us, although i would have loved some ranch and also a glass of wine. The same other employee came back and retrieved our empty appetizer plate....still no attention from our waiter. I saw him go over and speak to another table, which was conveniently in front of his parents booth, as he did so he had his phone out and was texting as his spoke to the table. (really?!) If he would have done that while speaking to our table I would have send something...but oh wait....he never really came back to our table AT ALL..There was another waitress walking by who graciously asked if we needed a refill of our drinks..since clearly we did and it wasn't going to get done by ''our'' waiter. Shortly after our food was brought out by yet another employee. Still.....not once did our ''waiter'' check in on us. Although he did make sure his parents were getting his full attention. And i get it, it's family and you want them to feel welcomed and enjoy the place you work at but not at the expense of your actual customers.  He did ask if my boyfriend needed to ''top off'' on his beverage, but that was also right before he brought us our check. We were there for over an hour and he only stopped by our table twice. 

I'm a Client Impact Manager for a 5 star company and I train customer service to my employees daily. I have never experienced such bad service from a waiter and I was appalled at the lack of engagement and attentiveness  he showed. 

If the food wasn't as good as it is, i'd highly consider never coming back."}
{"text":"We keep giving this place another chance and I don't know why. Our first experience was cranky service and burned pizza. The next one was subpar service and mediocre pizza. Pizza never got better, chicken fingers were awful and service was never really great with two more visits. I do have to say, the two times we've had the veggie pizza, it was really good. Other than that, not with recommending."}
{"text":"had the pizza a while back... not impressed.  spinach salad awesome as are the sandwiches.   was craving lasagne and ordered it last nite.   blah!!   flavor was very blan... added my own parm & spices to mke it edible.  stick with the sandwiches and salads id you order from here"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery on Sunday night was told it would be 45 minutes to an hour. It took an hour and half to get here. When it did arrive both my pizza and calazon were cold. Pizza was to behalf pepperoni with extra cheese pizza did not have extra cheese. Very disappointed tried calling but it rang a number if timed no answer. $38.00 on cold food and not made right. That's a lot of money for me.  Wish I could have talked to someone to fix this issue."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and almost everything was correct except for that we were given boneless wings instead of regular wings. I thought maybe I might've ordered the wrong thing by accident and checked my online receipt but nope. I ordered 3 pizzas and 36 wings in total and asked for 10 sets of utensils but only got 1. I would give 2.5 stars cause they got to my house in 25 mins after putting in my order but I wouldn't have minded an hour waiting time if they got it all correct."}
{"text":"Best tomato basil soup ever! Philly cheesesteak sandwich was great too. Had lunch there several times. Fast , friendly service"}
{"text":"I've seen quite a few people here rate this place on the lower end of service, but I, fortunately did not have that experience.  The service was great and the food was good.

There were very few people in the establishment so I can't speaking on noise level.  It was pretty mellow during our visit.  It has an open space layout so I would assume when the place is filled it can get a little noisy.

Our server brought out fresh baked cheese bread and marina sauce while we waited for our food.  The bread was crisp on the outside but very soft on the inside.  Tasty! :)  

As far as our order goes, my family and I were pleased with our choices.  My hubby said he had a great tasting turkey sub sandwich.

My son had a 10in pizza - I don't know what kind, but he loved it. 

I had a lunch special - garlic parm wings and a slice of pizza.

The garlic parm wings were great.  They were crispy (MY FAVE!) and real garlic bits on it.  The pizza was as expected and was not disappointing.  Personally it tasted like any other decent pizza in Cali, but there wasn't anything distinct about it.

The service was good.  Our drinks stayed filled and our food came out fast.  Although it's not on my list of places I'll make an exception to repeat, I had a good experience and would recommend this place for lunch stop. :)"}
{"text":"Some of the best Italian food I've had.  I enjoyed the outdoor seating, and the staff was very kind and patient with our party of 8 (4 of which were kids). Love the sweet potato pizza. That crust! Yum."}
{"text":"Came here have not eaten here for years. Now I know why food sucked. Got a Philly cheese steak meat tuff and a pepperoni  pizza with extra cheese it had no flavor. Beer is not as cold as it should be. Will not be back"}
{"text":"Came in today for chicken and the lunch combo was reasonably priced and very good. I Have eaten dinner here before and had pizza and salad. Pizza was good, salad was less then appealing in terms of quality and cost. Just wanted a side dinner salad and didn't expect it to cost $5 +. Will probably come back for lunch specials."}
{"text":"For the love of pizza that My coworkers & I share we decided to try this place  we haven't been to near our office. A nice marketing lady came by and dropped off a few flyers of their menu. On the menu it stated if you dine in you'll get complimentary cheesy bread with your meal. When we got there and mentioned it the waiter told us that his boss wasn't in so he can't honor that. That's confusing. Than I asked him what your soup of the day was and he Unconfidently stated there isn't a soup of the day. Mm.. No bread & no soup of the day. ¯\_(?)_/¯ 

The Caesar salad my coworkers ordered was just lettuce & one wedge tomato. There was no croutons, onions or any type of cheese which usually comes with a Caesar salad. 

My Italian Wedding soup came out warm. If I don't have to blow on the spoon before I put it in my mouth than it's not hot enough. The pizza was pretty ok, nothing that really made it special. I'd rather go a parking lot over to East West pizza for lunch and get 2 slices of pizza that comes with a drink for $5."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great staff.  I absolutely love the atmosphere of this resturant. I would recommend  trying the new york cheese steak pizza, one of my personal favorites. I will most definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Ok we stopped in at 830pm Thursday but it took about 15 minutes to place our order. Apparently, the take out orders are really more interesting than us sitting 20 feet away. 

It was tough choice between beer cheese with breadsticks or meatballs covered mozzarella and sauce.  The beer cheese do is really nice with smoky paprika coating on top & little bite of hot sauce on garlic knots that aren't twisted. But puffier than normal pizza dough chunks.

We ordered thin crust which was razor thin.   They use a hint of sauce more painted on than spread out.  I would prefer a bit more but hard to load up thin crust. I tried Genoa salami & pepperoni with extra cheese. It wasn't loaded with cheese either. The pizza was good.  Two people will eat a 14\" pizza fairly easily.

I rounded up to 3 stars from about 2 1/2 stars. The service was awfully slow for a dead time.  If you still beer get the 25 oz because you could run out and have a decent wait"}
{"text":"I am more then impressed I am lost for words. It has been a couple years since I been to my neighborhood spot and boy have I been missing out. 

I made it just in time for happy hour. After immediately being greeted I was given a nice warm basket of now my new favorite garlic knots with marinara sauce. Those babies were finger licking good. I took advantage of the 10inch pizza and fresh fries. Killed my diet but it was well worth cheating because everything was mighty tasty. So good you best believe I packed up my leftovers.


Quick notes:
The Resturant was clean
Service with a major smile 
Immediate refills on the soda
Quick service an checkup from waitress
Good fast and fresh
Happy Hour Specials Daily

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"Food was bland and overpriced. Child and teen were behind the bar the entire time I was eating there. Would not return."}
{"text":"Our first experience was via delivery on a Friday night. We used Grubhub. but it looks like they also have the delivery option on their own website. I was pretty impressed by the options for vegetarian salads. That sounds silly, but sometimes restaurants only offer one choice. We placed our order for a dinner salad, a small white pizza and a pound (!!!) of fries. 

Grubhub told us it would be an hour. I was pleasantly surprised when the delivery arrived about 40 minutes later. The delivery person was very friendly, and our order was packaged perfectly. 

The dinner salad was huge! Veggies were nice and fresh. We opted for the thin crust pizza. Not sure how \"New York\" that is, I'm guessing that's more for the West Coast crowd. But it was delicious nonetheless! We kept biting into yummy bits of garlic. 

And they're serious about the description on the fries. Definitely enough to share! They're seasoned with parmesan and garlic. 

It was a great first experience. Looking forward to dining in and trying those fries right out of the fryer."}
{"text":"Great local spot for Italian food. Pasta tasted great and was service was fairly quick. Great special on spaghetti on Wednesday and even offered a military discount. My son enjoys the fettuccini Alfredo and the garlic fries."}
{"text":"Chicken is to die for! On a recommendation from a friend we came here. Wasn't expecting anything special. Boy was I wrong. Pizza was very good, we got the New York Combo, thin & crispy crust. Waiter was on his game & very friendly. Wish there was one of these places in So Cal."}
{"text":"My husband love the food and the servers but one thing that is constant is incorrect order or not including something in our order. Last night I ordered through grub hub and after driving almost 10 miles I get home to missing sides. We took a hiatus for a bit from here but we truly like the food. Unfortunately this is something that has been consistent with our experience at Streets of NY. So if we decide to return for a take out order we will disect it on the spot to ensure we get what we ordered and paid for. Attention to detail is important!"}
{"text":"It's Labor Day ... everyone else is sitting in their backyard pools throwing back cold ones.  I needed carbs.  The carbs of choice was pizza.  The pizza of the night was Streets; it was the closest.  I didn't think the food was bad.  I actually liked the wings because it was a little different - kind of fried crispy without the heavy breading.  The server was attentive but had the personality of a pile of sand - so it just canceled each other out.  My husband's joke was ... it's New York.  Whaddyaspect?  I'd probably go back if I had a coupon."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday night with my step dad and step brother and my son. We waited at the sign where it says \"please wait to be seated\" we waited and the guy asked if we were dining in and he said we could seat ourselves. 

The waiter came and handed out menues. I glanced around to other booths it was a lil empty. But at the same time several tables were dirty. 

Our food came out right away. The server came to our table once to see if we needed any thing.  We ordered pizza and 12 wings. The wings were okay a little under cooked. But the pizza was great. 

The also do military discount.  Great for family and big crowds.  There are several televisions that show sporting events as well as outdoor eating."}
{"text":"Awesome service and always super yummy food! I love this place. Great job!
The wings are the best in town and they have a great variety of pizza to choose from. 
I'll be visiting them frequently!
Kid friendly too! They even put high chair covers over the high chairs for sanitary purpose! So cool!"}
{"text":"I've not eaten at this place but a couple times.  The first time was at a different location but given they are the same style, I would say that it's fair to say their pizza style is the same.  For me, it's not that good.  If you love pizza, and have experienced many types, styles and from many places, I'm not sure you will like this.  However, their BAKED wings are awesome.  I don't like their deep fried one's (we forgot to specify the second time we ordered them :(    but baked are really good.   Service was good at both stores."}
{"text":"I have not eaten at a Streets of New York in years. We went last night to get some dinner. We arrived at 9 and they close at 10. We were the only ones there eating. The staff was very friendly. The pizza was way better than I remembered it being. Their wings are very good, we got medium but they were more on the mild side compared to other places. We will definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"Really delicious!!  We had grown disenchanted with local pizza places but decided to give this place a try after receiving the flyer on our door and reading the other reviews.  The pizza was great!  We got the New York Combo on crispy crust and we ate every morsel.  Really great pizza and we are hooked!"}
{"text":"Restaurant is pretty VEGAN friendly. I end up eating here quite frequently given it's close proximity to my house. I appreciate that the staff ALWAYS listens to special requests (no cheese, no dressing...). I have never had a slip up here with added unwanted ingredients! I usually stick with a salad and soup or the bruschetta appetizer sans butter. My boyfriend really likes their veggie sandwich and their fries are yummy!"}
{"text":"They do not follow through with delivery orders. Many times I have asked for extra marinara sauce, I've asked for just minor additional items and they never come through. 
Fortunately their pizza and  food is really good but the service is Unsatisfactory. When they find a way to combine much better service with the food quality provided they will get their4-5  stars."}
{"text":"Have ordered take out from here and both times it was awful. First, they said pizza would be ready in 30 minutes. I arrived in 40 and it still wasn't ready. I honestly think they forgot to start it cuz I had to wait 20 minutes. Then I had also ordered fries with it and by the time my pizza was ready, the fries were cold. For the expensive price of their pizzas, I would hope for better service. Huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Meh. I feel like the pizza at streets of new york is pretty plain jane.

I came here for lunch with my boyfriend, the restaurant was clean and not too busy. Actually,  it wasn't busy at all.

Our server was nice, but we didn't see much of her so when we needed something,  she was nowhere to be found. 

We were pretty hungry so we started off with the garlic bread sticks. When they came out, it looked like melted cheese on hot dog buns. The bread was frozen previously,  you could tell by the way the bread reheated and tasted. The marinara dipping sauce was also very watery and tasteless. 

When our pizza came out, there was so much grease on it, I was surprised.  The pizza was also pretty plain. Nothing special. 

Overall,  I'd say that streets of new york is an over priced pizza place fir those who also enjoy pizza hut & dominoes."}
{"text":"Good Cheese and Pepperoni Pizza (7 out of 10) but don't try to get too fancy anything beyond basic hasn't been very good. Service is hit and miss, our family has been to eat at this location at least 6 times and it has declined in the last 6 months."}
{"text":"Had the spinach salad and Italian wedding soup. Food was good. Service was very good. They have several televisions and it looks like a pretty good place to grab a drink and watch the game with friends."}
{"text":"Bad. With a capital \"B\"

Based on the pizza we got, I have a hard time believing the person that cooked it ever set foot in a pizza place anywhere in the NY/NJ area, ever.

We ordered a half meatball, half pepperoni pizza. We expected for the pizza to look at least a little like the pizza on the menu.  What we got would barely pass for Dominos, but for twice the price. Thick, doughy crust, sauce that was more like tomato paste than anything resembling sauce, and way overcooked cheese.  And \"meatball\" as a topping should be just that-sliced meatballs. Ground beef  spread over the cheese is not meatball.

Just really bad. I was hoping for another of a handful of NY style pizza places here in town. This establishment just doesn't cut it. We'll stick to our regular places.

FYI-we only had the pizza. For all we know the sandwiches or other dishes could be just fine. But for a place to call itself \"Streets of NY\" would imply a good pizza pie.  Which this wasn't."}
{"text":"Food was decent, they seemed a bit understaffed with one poor woman serving the entire restaurant. She was busting her ass. 

Admittedly the outside temperature is above normal, but this restaurant is not kept cool enough for my taste. The ice in the ice teas was melted by the time it arrived at the table. SONY would have gotten more stars at a lower temperature."}
{"text":"Average food, great service, average prices. Ive had better pasta at olive garden."}
{"text":"Health Department will be notified of this place.  Under no circumstance should bloody raw chicken be served!!  Never will I return to this place!  So glad my kids didn't touch any of the chicken.  I let the acting manager/ server know about it.  All she said was : \"yeah that's disgusting and she will let her manager know\". No REAL manager on duty and there was only a couple people in entire restaurant!  Not a good place!  I will never return here !  Disgusting!"}
{"text":"I had an unfortunate first impression tonight.  I arrived for takeout, the place was packed, which I figured was a good sign.  The manager asked a young woman to help me with my order and she must have been new; I waited and waited while she asked questions from others and finally put together my order.  She asked if I had paid online, I had, and we were done, no \"Thanks\" or \"Come again,\" she just turned away.

Fortunately I hadn't driven too far when it occurred to me that my order seemed a little light--it was--two items were missing.  I drove back and waited while this young woman took an order on the phone, she looked at me but with no apparent recognition.  I grabbed the manager who had someone else to get the rest of my order.  As I was leaving I was asked again if I had paid online, when I told him I had and he asked if I had signed the receipt.  \"No, what receipt?\" At that point he had me sign the receipt.  I had left the first time without my full order and without signing the receipt!

By the time I arrived home the food was cold; I was the only thing heated up.  The food was marginal, but honestly, had had the food been hot, I think it would have been better.  There are too many good reviews about the food, in fact, that's the reason we chose Streets of New York.  

Bad service happens sometimes and it's a shame that the food was cold.  My only regret is that I thought I would save time and include the tip in my online payment--shame on me, the tip should always come after the service."}
{"text":"In my option, this the best for pizza and wings hands down. The happy hour is really good deal Monday-Thursday. Also they have a good lunch deals."}
{"text":"It's better than the big chain pizza guys but far from New York pizza.  I heard a friend rave about it so got it delivered.  The pizza was cool enough that the cheese was almost solidified and I live a mile away.  The pepperoni they use is a really good brand.  The sauce was OK.  A little heavy on the spices and too acidic and the crust didn't even taste like it belonged with the pizza, it just didn't bring anything to the party.  We also got the artichoke dip which was spot on, served with tasty, toasted Italian bread. The dip was a creamy, cheesy sauce filled with artichoke that was firm and had a lot of flavor.   The only real problem I have with it was that the pizza was not cooked on a stone, it was cooked in a convection-conveyor oven.  I could tell because of not only the flavor, but when I flipped a piece over, I could see the screen imprinted on it.  If you're going to be as bold to have the words \"New York\" in the title of your brand, at least cook pizza in a stone oven to achieve that lovely dark brown char on the bottom that is a staple of New York pizza which not only makes for a better crust, but overall flavor.  I'm willing to give it another shot.  Next time I'll eat in and try some pasta."}
{"text":"I tried this place several years ago when I first moved to Arizona. It was never strong enough to make my regular rotation. So I decided to revisit Streets of New York several times over last few months.

First of all, my favorite has to be the Garlic Knots, which are sent to your table free of charge. They are made with pizza dough and perfectly complimented with the right amount of butter and garlic. Marinara sauce is served with this dish. Quickly grab some or else someone at your table will devour your piece for you.

The Hot Pastrami Sandwich with cheese is packed with a lot of meat and perfectly cooked with the cheese melted on it. I would say that this dish will fill you up and is probably my favorite from the menu. The Chicken Parmesan Meal comes with your choice of type of pasta and easily is two meals. It's good, but not in my top 5. They also serve a Chicken Parmesan Sandwich. The Penne Pasta is average, enough said. The soft drinks are a tad expensive, What,  do they think we are actually in NY, NY? $2.90 for a soda, the mixture seems off to me. But it's a better alternative than the water, which does not taste good.

I went in there looking for the Eggplant dish on their menu and was told they don't serve it. The Eggplant Rollatini was on the online menu. They need to synchronize their menus.

The service by the wait staff has been courteous and flawless every time we've been there."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Perfect for Date Night or lunch or whenever!!! The food was Fantastic!!! And the Price was affordable!!! Awesome staff and Clean place!! Thx so much Streets!!!"}
{"text":"Love the Passion Bread with every order! Yummy Chicken Parmigiana! Danya is always cheerful and awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Delivery took 55 minutes for one pizza, which was within the 45 minutes - 1 hour time frame I was quoted. But the pizza wasn't even warm when it was delivered and the restaurant is less than a mile from my house. I ordered a cheese pizza and added pepperoni to half of it. The pizza I got wasn't half and half, every slice had pepperoni on it. 

Definitely not worth the $26.47 (not including tip) I paid for it."}
{"text":"I found this place about 6 months ago. I have been here at least 20 times since. I only have ordered two things on the menu, Lasagna and anti pasta salad. They both are super yummy. This is a great place to eat. The staff is wonderful."}
{"text":"Wings were burnt. Pizza was lackluster, overpriced, and layered in too much cheese. We ordered to pick up on a very slow Friday, but they didn't bother to recook the obviously burnt wings but send them home with us instead."}
{"text":"I got the 24 Med wings bone in and a 16\" pepperoni pizza. The food arrived hot, the wings were tasteful and the pizza was perfect."}
{"text":"Love Streets pizza. We walk from our house, which is a big plus and have not been disappointed. Keep up the good cooking."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch during my wife lunch break last week.  She had been before, but it was my first time.  From the outside this place looks pretty small, but when you go in it extends fairly deeply and has mirrored walls, so it's actually quite roomy.  There is a bar up front, and a fair amount of booths and regular tables.  The place is clean, and everything from the decor down to most of the people eating there makes you feel as if you may actually be in NYC.

My wife ordered the spaghetti with meat sauce, and I tried the baked ziti since it was on the lunch special.  They brought us out some breadsticks and marinara dipping sauce.  The bread was hot out of the oven, fresh, and soft.  The marinara was warmed as well.  Very good.

The ziti is gargantuan.  It comes out heaping on the plate, loaded with sauce, italian sausage, and mushrooms, and is topped with a layer of melted mozzarella cheese.  I'm not generally a fan of mushrooms, but most of them were diced small enough not to matter, and the others were easy enough to pick out or around.  The ziti noodles were prepared well and not hard like you sometimes get with baked pasta dishes.  In all, one of the best ziti dishes I've had.  I would definitely recommend it.  

I also tried a bit of my wife's spaghetti and meat sauce.  They use the larger traditional spaghetti rather than the spaghettini most places use.  It was cooked well, and the meat sauce was flavorful.  It was good, but not the best I've had.

Overall, it was a good experience and I'd like to go back and try more of their menu items."}
{"text":"We loved their pizza. And the artichoke dip is amazing. Rodolfo is our favorite server. Enjoy every visit."}
{"text":"This place is a random find. My husband noticed it when we were getting our taxes done next door. 
I'm a fan of new york style pizza, though I've never been to new york. I'm Italian so I say the taste for it is in my DNA. He's from Chicago, enough said. Besides that though, we both love good food and can usually appreciate the other's tastes. Pizza is one of our biggest compromises. He really does come over to the dark side quite often, and tonight was no exception. We went for a 14\" thin crust with pep, salami, ham and feta all over, with Kalamata olives on half. We were given complimentary garlic rolls and ordered cheesy garlic toast. I was actually impressed. It was a great blend of flavors and was well cooked through and through. Our pizza was tasty and crisp, though not the best I've ever had. It definitely is up at the top though and being so close with a delivery option, it earns the extra star.

Service tonight was exceptional. This is what set this place apart for me. I have places I like the taste of better, but will come here for the service. The waiter was the only one on duty for the whole place, and there were about 10 tables of 2 or more. Our glasses were never below 1/2 way before he refilled them. He had a welcoming and friendly attitude. All in all, a great experience. We look forward to trying their sandwiches and soups, but maybe not all the appetizers, as their pics on the website aren't excessively appetizing."}
{"text":"When I come to this side of town I make it a point to eat here or get it to go! The staff is always kind, efficient & the food is scrumptious! I enjoy the casual atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"So, these guys just got a new GF Pizza, so of course I had to try it out and add it to my list! The pizza was just okay... Also had a pear and walnut salad that was good... but there was definitely something in there that contained gluten; Celiac's eat with caution haha.

It has an interesting atmosphere... a lot of little knick-knacks, a fake tree and \"patio\" in the middle of the restaurant. Decent service, though!"}
{"text":"Wife and I was on our second stop of trying a couple of local pizza joints. We really enjoyed the ambiance inside. Needed to be cleaned a little better. And need to put the broom up instead of behind the cashier? Both of us agreed that the pizza was just OK. But we brought a slice home for our daughter, and she loved it? I felt the pizza was not cooked enough, the sauce was awesome, but the crust was like a bread type of crust. Service needs to be better, Our slice was ready for about ten minutes until we finally received it. Over all this place is alright, but there are better places to go."}
{"text":"Just wanted a pizza for delivery! The hotel recommended them, and I was quite happy. We ordered a garlic chicken calzone, chicken tenders, potato skins, and minestrone soup. We were very happy with the delivery time and food. Would buy from again!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time here if you want any quality food items. Soggy 10\" thin crust pizza bottom. Wings come in an extra small size. Specialty drinks are less than ho-hum. The fish used to be a very large sized chunk of haddock. No more, it is now just \"fish\", whatever that means. The coffee is good, but who goes there for coffee. Since they serve mostly older people, they don't seem to be concerned with quality or fast service. The new game system was a no winner for me. The one I was given didn't work. Their draft beers have always been lackluster often devoid of CO2. Make you decision based on facts."}
{"text":"Good pizza.  Other stuff on the menu (salad, dessert).  Online ordering & pickup works well. Not sure what else is to be said."}
{"text":"So....ordered delivery and it came within 45 minutes as they mentioned. Ordered a cheese calzone and as I was eating I was chewing on the cheese a little too long...I pulled out a big piece of plastic! Disappointed bc it was good. Had a cookie and it was amazing! I called and they offered to send a new calzone but it was too late and I was over it, second option was to give a credit but I don't think I'll be eating again. Oh well."}
{"text":"So disappointed! I had been wanting to try their broaster chicken for a while, but I could never justify spending that much on chicken. Since I was by myself this week, I decided to splurge on an 8 piece, figuring it would last a couple of meals. Sadly, I was wrong. To begin, their chicken pieces are very, very small. Have you ever gotten a breast that you thought was a thigh because it was tiny? Yeah, they were all like that. Bigger than a Cornish game hen, but not much. Now, if the chicken had been super tasty, I could have overlooked that issue. However, though there is the perfect amount of breading, it is totally bland. It's like they dredged it in plain flour. After salting it myself, it was pretty good though. For the final issue, we go back to the breasts. I understand that white meat can be a little dry, but the breasts were so dry, they were almost powdery. I had to gulp down some juice with the chicken still in my mouth so that I didn't choke. 
But hey, my dog was happy. So if spending $20 on 8 pieces of bland chicken that you can really only eat 6 of and the rest have the bulk of half as much chicken anywhere else is your thing, go for it."}
{"text":"Grew up on east coast and miss NY style pizza after years in Minnesota. Crust doughy, sauce bland. Reminded me of Dominos. A crime to call this NY style pizza.  Never going back."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had in Las Vegas! This place delivers too. Far above everyone else. Nice restaurant with wonderful food."}
{"text":"Ok! Finally decided to place an order for two Pizzas and the Broaster chicken. Michael who took the order is Very Pleasant and took his time taking my order. I was told it will take 45 mins. to an hour but to my surprise it arrived early. And also to my Big Surprise, the quality of the Pizzas that I ordered and the Broaster Chicken, To die for! Good Job you Guys over there at Streets of New York Pizza! You are my family's favorite Pizza joint from now on! Only regret is I did not try you out sooner! I'll Be Back for more! Keep up with the Excellent Quality of your Pizza!"}
{"text":"This place is non-updated, dismal lighting and seating...dank restroom, good service, but fighting a loosing battle with all the good food choices in the area. Especially when prices are a lousy value. We got a cheapy, frozen-like quality, 10' pizza and one glass of cabernet for $ 23. Never go back."}
{"text":"Seeking a dine in place for slice of pizza for kiddos and I to kill 2 hours for last client of the  night: 7pm. To our surprise it's Tuesday's $1.00 cheese pizza slice day! Ended up with street  fries, chessy passion bread and chicken parmigiana. Portions were just right for a party of 4. So tasty and yummy."}
{"text":"Pizzas were cut in squares, not wedges, so only a few pieces in the center had most of the toppings. Peperroni was bland, tasted like turkey pepperoni, no flavor.

Chose the thin crust, texture was like unleavened crackers. Dry, tastless. Skimpy sauce and skimpy cheese. Sausage was ok. In general, a very dry pizza.

The pizzas were not reminiscent of NY. Will continue to search for an authentic version."}
{"text":"This pizza is the REAL reason I come back to Arizona.  When I travel for work the first thing I do when I get to my hotel is call and get my favorite pizza delivered.  This location is so nice and very customer focused.  I can't get this stuff where I live so it's awesome that these guys even remember me when I call in.  If you are looking for a place that acts like a mom and pop but is really a successful chain, look no further!"}
{"text":"I plan to visit New York one day, but if this is an example of their food I'll skip it. We ordered a pizza and wings. The pizza tasted like deep fried cardboard with Chef Boy R De De sauce on it. Bland does not come close. Imagine if you took three day old dried bread and put a dusting of ketchup as a topping. 

Wings! Oh my sweet goodness, the Wings!! Take a plain wing. Cook it in its own fat, then drench it in vinegar. Serve. Run before anyone tastes it. There you go. 

Worth skipping. I'm not a Dominos fan, but I'll take one of their industrial pre-fab pies over this place any day of the week. 

Off to go brush this experience off my taste buds with a turpentine/Lysol mixture. Argh!!!"}
{"text":"They should change the name to Streets of Bejing because their pizza, wings, and sandwiches are about as far from New York as anything I've ever experienced!

Even the worst New York pizza is better than what this place is serving up.
The wings tasted like they were dipped in vinegar.  No flavor.
I've eaten at this location several times, each time thinking how maybe I just got a bad dish, or they were off their game that day. Not the case. 

Good thing for the owners how most people in Arizona who enjoy S.O.N.Y. have never tasted real New York Pizza and wings, otherwise they'd have been out of business long ago.
I will never grace their doorstep again, even if they were giving it away!"}
{"text":"Pizza and wings lunch special was delicious! They have a four peaks cheese dip on the appetizer menu that is fantastic and their server Saul made the experience that much better!"}
{"text":"This place has really great food. Had the meatball sub and it was on point the service from Joey was great as well. Wanna try the pizza next."}
{"text":"Went in. 2 employees ignored us so we sat ourselves. I asked for a menu and the \"gentleman\" who works there rudely told me he would bring one to me \"in a minute\". No thanks. We left and went up the street to KOdonnels who has delicious pizza and fantastic service."}
{"text":"The waitress we had snubbed us for not ordering enough food and acted rude towards us. This place has poor servers with overpriced food."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Rich red sauce.  There's a few TVs but it's pretty peaceful. The pricing is good too. My lasagna was $12.50. Parking was ample and it's in a nice, newer strip mall. Service was good. I definitely will be back."}
{"text":"This may be the worst Pizza I have ever had. The salads look like they are the same quality as Mc Donald's pre packed in plastic in a refrigerator case. Service is SLOW and this is really just another junky pizza place with marketing that is far better than the place it's self. 
Go to Grimaldi's or Humble Pie instead. Even papa Johns is better."}
{"text":"Zero stars. Wife and I went one evening (around 6 pm weekday) to try out the pizza. Arrived to find people dining outside and inside. Reached for the door and it was locked. Looked inside and saw servers look at me and then quickly avert their gaze. Looked around to try to make eye contact with anyone resembling a manager or host and got the distinct impression I was being avoided. They win. We won't be trying again."}
{"text":"Because you can't eat Pomo every night and you don't want to deal with the crowds at Oreganos or Spinatos.  A solid pizza for the price point, a good weekday family option."}
{"text":"We really like this place; great to bring the kids, have good pizza and maybe a beer. They play sports so my husband likes it. The pizza is delish. They randomly serve a whole menu of fried chicken which is unique. It is a little pricey but the pizza is for sure a step above Pizza Hut etc."}
{"text":"We ordered an order to pick up for the first time! The order was done and the estimated time. The meal was really pretty good! My pasta that I customized was delicious served with a super fresh nicely portioned salad (more than 1 dressing would have been nice). My fiancé had a pizza which had delicious toppings but it was a bit under cooked towards the center making it kinda soggy & doughy. The garlic toast was crisp & flavorful. A nice meal for pick up!"}
{"text":"BEST PIZZA I HAVE EVER HAD!!!! Hands down!
The fact that google maps hasn't updated where I live off Grand Teton and the fact these guys can get here every time without having to call and ask me how to get to my house is great - Several other delivery places have done this to me and its beyond frustrating to have to stop and give directions multiple times within 20 minutes... Their delivery drivers are amazing and friendly and don't pull up to the door in a hooptie with the music blasting which is really nice!"}
{"text":"Service was not good, place felt dirty. Pepper and parmesan shakers were slick with grease or something.  Pizza was great though. Recommend making a takeout order and NOT dining in."}
{"text":"sorry folks this place is over priced for the quality I ordered two slices and a salad the pizza was not good quality the peperoni was not good quality for the price I don't mind paying for good food but 20 bucks for poor quality no thanks wont be back."}
{"text":"I'll be shocked if this place is open much longer. The garlic bread was either stale or freezer burned - probably why it was free. The bacon in my cobb salad was so fatty and chewy that I ended up spitting out more than a few pieces into my napkin. Waitress had two other tables in the entire restaurant and was hardly around. No wonder the place is always deserted - even after being recently remodeled."}
{"text":"they have the best gluten free pizza if u have trouble with gluten, amazing customer service and friendly atmosphere recommend going here if u love pizza and wings :-)"}
{"text":"i went to streets of new york last week with a friend of mine, looking to try a new place for chicken wings.
but the first thing i noticed when we stepped in was that the place was filthy (the bathroom looked like it hadnt been cleaned for a month)
when i sat back down my friend told me to look at the \"clean\" plates that they had given us. i picked one up and it was covered with old salad, crutons and dressing. it looked like they just took it off some other dirty table and given it to us. the wings were terrible, they were pretty much just frozen chicken nuggets drenched in 5 pounds of sauce, and the \"water\" they gave us tasted like a half old soda, half water mixture. i was disgusted  at this place and recomend that anyone looking for pizza or wings take their business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and our server, Brittney. They have multiple TV screens so that you can watch your sports, serve beer and wine and just a really cute atmosphere. Salad was perfectly dressed fresh fresh veggies, we were served garlicky bread when we came. And also they have patio dining."}
{"text":"So disappointed!! I have ordered online from them many times. I am the kind of person who is willing to pay more for good quality and I don't mind a wait either. In fact I am an ideal customer, who rarely complains. Tonight was terrible!! I ordered my dinner through the website a little early, because I know it usually takes an hour or so for the food to arrive, though I am only 2 blocks away. My order was supposed to arrive at 6:30. At 7:15 I decided to give them a call to make sure there were no issues. The girl who answered the phone assured me that my order had just left. So we waited. At 8:10 I had my significant other call, and he was informed not only did they have no order for me, but that in fact their computer had just happened to break today. So the 60.00 I was charged through their personal website was not even on record. On asking to speak with a manager we were informed that only she and a cook were there, no manager on site. So there was no way to get my money back until I spoke with this higher up? Don't get me wrong I have a decent amount of money in my account, but 60.00 is nothing to scoff at. It's too late now to order pizza anywhere else, since we waited all night for this order that didn't go through. I am not even upset really about the order messing up, I mean things happen. I am super mad about the fact that I was blatantly lied to, when I could have made different accommodations for my evening other than waiting for food that never came.. Someone can use some training on customer service- NEVER LIE, especially if you aren't going to come through for the person!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in while running errands. I had the lasagna with a garden salad. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality versus the cost, which was 1.75 extra. It had a decent mixed greens with generous helpings of tomato, cucumber and black olives. The lasagna was served nice and hot and the sausage in it was flavorful. It might have been a wee bit salty but otherwise very good. Service at the bar was good as I was never without a drink, and the food came out in a timely manner. 

Overall I was pretty happy. I don't get over here very often but I'll definitely keep this place in mind."}
{"text":"I've lived right around the corner from this place for 3 years now, and this is the first time I've ever been.

My parents, visiting from Upstate NY had a groupon, so I figured we'd give it a shot. 

The pizza was very good, the Four Peaks beer cheese was tremendous with the garlic bread.

But honestly what compelled me to write a review was our server, Amanda. She was spectacular. 

She recommended the Neapolitan pizza to my mom and sister, and they loved it. She kept our drinks coming, my 2 year old entertained...and genuinely treated us like we were the only ones in the place. 

Again, the food was delicious - worthy of a 2nd visit for sure. But Amanda pretty much guaranteed we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Streets of New York teamed up with UBS and provided vouchers for a free cheese pizza as a thank you for donating blood through the United Blood Services. I went ahead and ventured out to this location to redeem my reward and was very pleasantly surprised with my experience. I was greeted promptly, the atmosphere was welcoming and clean and my server was attentive. I ordered a raspberry ice tea, a Greek salad and the the 14'' Pizza, although I decided to add chicken, sun dried tomatoes and mushrooms to it. Not only was the salad and pizza delicious, I was also impressed with the presentation. All the ingredients tasted fresh, the crust was buttery and perfectly golden, and the sauce added a nice robust flavor to the pizza. To say the least, I will certainly return for seconds."}
{"text":"If you're thinking about going here, think about Buca di Beppo, Olive Garden, Mark Rich's New York Pizza and Pasta, Metro Pizza, Rosati's Pizza, ANYWHERE else.  With the amount of choice we have here in Las Vegas, I cannot stress enough that FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DO NOT waste your time at this place.  Like many others have said, they cannot get an order right (or a check, for that matter).  

We came here every Monday for 10 weeks to play trivia.  We returned each week because we wanted to play trivia, despite the fact that the service was atrocious (orders incorrect, forgotten beverages, cold food, charging regular price instead of happy hour prices, etc.).  

This has all come to an end because of the final experience we had last night.  We came to play Vegas Pub Quiz Trivia in a group of ten.  We all ordered dinner and alcohol, purposely spending a little extra to give business to the establishment hosting trivia.  The house music was playing.  As you can imagine, it is next to impossible to concentrate on a DJ-led trivia game with extraneous background noise.  When we asked to have the music turned down (not off) the owner not only didn't make an effort to placate the ten tables of trivia players, but she deliberately turned the music louder. Then she approached the Trivia DJ and let him now that she didn't care what the people wanted. 

I will never subject myself, my family, or my friends (and I wouldn't subject my enemies either) to this blatant disregard for customers.  If she is willing to treat loyal customers this way, I shudder to think about how she would treat you.  

This would be a great location for a good family-friendly Italian restaurant.  I'm anxiously awaiting a change of ownership!"}
{"text":"Not the greatest as far as atmosphere and service, but it is the only place we've found in Scottsdale that has gluten-free pizza for my wife. This is the only reason I give SoNY three stars. Without the gf pizza, it would get maybe two at most.

The regular pizza is ok at best. Nothing special. The gluten free pizza however, is actually pretty good. I don't know how they make the crust, but I like it. The next time we go, that's what I'll be ordering. 

Their menu promises complimentary garlic knots (or something similar... can't remember exactly what they're called) but the three times we've been there, I haven't ever actually seen them. I even asked the waitress about them a few times, and she promised to bring them out but never did. I'm not the kind of customer to constantly nag a waitress. I'll ask once, maybe twice, and after that it comes out of the tip. Twice now I've not left any tip."}
{"text":"Being new to Phoenix we sought out this restaurant
and have eaten there 15 times easily. The quality is
good, service very friendly, my issue is price, its simply
too expensive to eat there anymore, 2 pizza's with a
small salad  $57, its just  too much for what you get and
no coupons or discounts or rewards for regular customers.
Everyone knows what pizza costs to produce and people
just want to feel good and not taken advantage of.
We are moving on."}
{"text":"This place is surrounded by pizza, beer and wing joints so until recently, we never cut through the noise and bright lights to take a chance here. Although the restaurant's location is a little obscure, it has turned out to be a pretty great place. The employees/kids do a good job and are friendly. We have never had bad service here and the atmosphere is pleasant. Its not Gianfranco by Darcy Ristorante but that's kind of the point. At least here, the food is tasty and you get what you paid for."}
{"text":"Hubby and I were starving tonight! So we called to the \"Streets\" to deliver a large pizza and some BBQ chicken.  Amy answered the phone and delivered our pizza within an hour.  Best meal ever due to our empty stomachs and true because it was truly good.  I will be ordering again! However, the price was a bit high for us so it'll be awhile before I do that."}
{"text":"Food was solid. Service was poor, at least the one waitress that helped us. She struggled even understanding her own menu."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Streets of New York for a while now.  I prefer their pizza to popular chain stores such as Pizza Hut or Domino's.  I always get their combination pizza and wings or pizza and antipasto salad.  I LOVE THEIR ANTIPASTO SALAD.  Only beef with them of late is that they no longer provide coupons for their pizza in their sign up e-mail club.  In current economic times, $30+ for delivery of 1 pizza and either 12 or 24 wings or a salad is a bit extreme.  Also, their pizza is inconsistent.  Sometimes it's overcooked, rarely is it perfect.  I think this location just isn't up to par with other ones, say North Phoenix.  It's a gamble, but I would recommend trying them out.  When they get it right, pizza is delicious."}
{"text":"I'm always greeted with a warm smile, no matter who's hosting that day.  I like Street's consistent menu, no matter which location I choose, and I really enjoy their pizza..."}
{"text":"If you are expecting a pizza place to understand how to do pizza delivery, do not order from Streets of New York.  When I placed orders via the website, often the information about toppings would get lost in translation.  We have had orders arrive well over an hour past the expected delivery time.  Finally, we recently had a pizza order that never arrived, and when we called for status we were repeatedly told \"the driver is on his way\" even though they are only located a couple of blocks down the street.  This was the final straw which caused my wife and I to vow to never order from Streets of New York again."}
{"text":"Ordered the Diamondback triple pizza, which was delicious. However, the awesome service was the thing that really stood out. Our server (Brandon) had a ton of tables, but somehow managed to provide better service than I've seen in a long time."}
{"text":"As my wife says, \"They are always a 5 star visit\". We tried the white pizza with mozzarella, ricotta and bacon and I have to say it was AMAZING!! So much so that my wife had 3 pieces! The kids enjoyed the spaghetti and pizza slice from the kids menu as well. Will visit again when in town next year for sure!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Phoenix!  I usually get one every week.  Love the Christmas gift cards."}
{"text":"Usually we go to the location nearest us, but somehow decided to visit this one instead.  It's quite a big larger, but I'm happy to report it was pretty dead on a Monday night.  Just the way I like it.  

Pizza was hot with no soggy middle.  I prefer a little spicier sauce, but have no real complaints otherwise.  We were served some complimentary bread balls...I'm sure that's not what they're called, but it's what I remember.  Some were fresh, some were obviously not.  Must have been a mix of freshly baked and what was leftover from an hour ago.  Of course I ate them anyway.  They were free after all!"}
{"text":"Not one of the nicer of the chain-kind of dumpy actually.  Maybe that's why it's never been very crowded the few times I have been there.  Nice place when you just want to relax without a lot of noise and chaos.  My husband and I were the only ones in there tonight for most of our dinner.  Pizza is okay, not great, and service has been good so far.  We ordered garlic cheese bread before dinner.  It was made on a sesame roll-probably their sub rolls.  Kind of weird I thought.  I would probably skip that next time."}
{"text":"Horrible service!  Walked in and waited 25 minutes for someone to even take a drink order. Nothing.  Train your wait staff!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for lunch while doing our Sunday errands. I was surprised by how good our lunch was! We both got hit subs and were not disappointed. The food was great! When you first come in the seating is self serve so our server didn't see us for a little bit, and she seemed kind of busy with other things, but overall we will check it out again. We also had trouble getting a box at the end since she seemed to just want to get us out of there.

Food is very good!"}
{"text":"This is a nice neighborhood eatery. The menu is an interesting mix of pizza, pasta, sub sandwiches and fried chicken. I had the lunch special with spaghetti, lemonade and a dinner salad. Total cost including tax was $13.08. The spaghetti was nicely prepared, tasty and came with two slices of garlic bread. The garden salad was your typical dinner salad with olives, cucumbers and tomatoes. They offer a good variety of salad dressings to suit your taste. 

I didn't have dessert as my entree filled me up but I noted they offered a variety of cheesecakes for dessert."}
{"text":"I don't eat here, normally, but i was in the mood for so buffalo wings. I stopped to get two different kinds of wings. I wanted honey bbq and mild wings. This was  Disappointing. I realize they offer a gluten free pizza, but from what i understand its from Gluten Creations and i really don't like that crust, so that is out. 
The two stars was for the customer service. They gave me a drink and offered free bread sticks while i waited. Thought that was nice. 
Although they were really friendly here, i can't see why we needed to make a second attempt.


Dear Rick P. 
I didn't eat the breadsticks because of my allergies, did have some water while I waited. 
I wasn't planning on getting a pizza that night, just the wings, but I was told previously that your crust was gluten creations, my mistake. 
The 2 stars are for the disappointing wings. 
They were really bad.  And your third comment, \"we, as in me and my family\" don't feel we need to try Streets of New York"}
{"text":"2 stars from the vegan perspective. Why? Because they don't have much of any vegan food.

1) The pizza sauce contains cheese
2) The marinara sauce contains cheese
3) Their margarine contains whey
4) Their pasta contains egg or milk

So PLEASE start offering a vegan entrée and some vegan marinara sauce SoNY! Maybe some whole wheat pasta too?

I would like to take this opportunity to complement and praise our amazing server Andrea. She is so awesome! She happily took the time to check on all of the items and dish ingredients for us to find out if they were vegan (or most often, not). Amazing customer service!

We wound up eating the following:
Custom made passion bread with no garlic butter or cheese. We had it brushed with olive oil and added some oregano. We then made an olive oil + balsamic + oregano dip.
A salad with their Italian dressing.
A small pizza with no cheese, no sauce, veggies + pineapple & olive oil added as a base.

Their passion bread (made from pizza crust) is super delicious but it really sucked that we couldn't dip in some marinara."}
{"text":"Worst wings I have ever had in my life. 
They were gooey! I asked for them to be well done. Would hate to see what cooked regularly looks like! 
Medium buffalo sauce might as well have been nothing. No flavor and weird disgusting texture. 
There was a puddle of grease under them.. and they are baked! How does that happen? 
Totally unacceptable to be sold as food. Barely edible. I threw most of them away. 
Pizza was just okay. At least it was edible. 
Hard to find places to deliver out to where I am so this is one of maybe 2-3 choices. Will not order from here again!"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good. I really enjoyed it very comfortable environment and friendly servers, I  have to give Ryan a good word he was very good and on point every step of the way...Thanks everyone.  I will return."}
{"text":"Called to order a large cheese pizza a week ago. Was told that there was special that night for getting pizza by the slice that it would save me money. However, the per slice order did not meat the minimum delivery charge so in the end I got hoodwinked into getting a salad as well and ended up spending more than I wanted to had I just gotten what I originally ordered. Although, I can appreciate the art of an upsell, this is a business that needs returning customers and referrals and neither will be happening in this case. The pizza was mediocre at best as well and I'd return to other local spots before going back here just based on the pizza alone. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Good delivery when we don't want to make pizza and wings ourselves. Wings are different for sure. Pizza is good. No bad experiences so far."}
{"text":"My husband goes from naught to hangry in about 3 minutes, so when he said he was feeling peckish as we investigated the kitten situation across the parking lot, I knew it was go time. 
We popped in and were invited to seat ourselves. We chose a back booth for privacy so I could nurse our daughter if need be. Roberta greeted us promptly and we instantly took a liking to her warm demeanor. When hearing we were newbies, she immediately explained the ins and outs of the menu, how to get the most hang for our buck, etc.
The pizza slices were massive. The price was fabs (I love being able to fill up on $3!).
We will be back!"}
{"text":"I would choose ANY other pizza place over this one!  The chicken tenders were delivered in a pool of BBQ sauce, so much so that they are soggy.  The cheese steak is not much more than a roll with a very few thinly sliced pieces of steak and some cheese, no peppers or onions, mostly bread!!  Although the name sounds great, trust me that any other NY pizza place in Vegas will be better than this.  So disappointing, especially for the price!"}
{"text":"This was some of the best pizza I've had. The crust was perfect. We will be ordering takeout again from here. Delicious pizza and calzone."}
{"text":"The service sucks really really bad! We had to go in to ask for more bread and again to get our check. We sat on the patio. We watched 4 employees stand around and do nothing but talk to each other.....food was good!! Service sucked"}
{"text":"ITSY BITSY TINY CHICKEN

INCONSISTENT PIZZA QUALITY

Inconsistent pizza quality --- hit and miss. The broasted chicken is overpriced for the size of chicken (very small) that they are using --- buyer beware. 

And warm, none refrigerated Cole slaw? Forget trying this potential bacterial nightmare."}
{"text":"Great good and even better service. I wish I would've got the mans name that delivered because he deserves all the credit! He made my day."}
{"text":"Delivery for one GF pizza and two orders of wings took 1 hours, 20 minutes. Pizza arrived cold and without sauce. Long waits for less than average, cold food. I'll think we'll order elsewhere next time. Have eaten in and food was okay. Maybe not a great delivery option."}
{"text":"Pizza?  Still just as great as I remember it.  Sausage and pepperoni.... mmmm.  

The staff is always friendly, even when I have my 2 little monsters with me.

This time, when I went in, it seemed they had a house full of parents with their kids in tow.  We all sat close to one another as well.

The service really shines here, the server acknowledged both of my kids, asking them directly what they wanted to drink.  My 4 year old pretended to read the menu, as did my little mimic 2 year old, and he confidently ordered Sprite, with a smile.

I love it when servers know how to treat children.  I will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"We are on vacation and were staying at the Hilton and wanted some above average pizza take out.  Multiple people mentioned this place, so we gave it a shot even though they only get 3 stars.  Dumb.  Trust the stars people.  The pizza was above average priced.  The crust was chewy and hard.  There was not enough sauce, so the whole pizza experience was dry.  The greek salad was ok.  Overall, definitely a 3 star pizza place in my opinion."}
{"text":"Pizza - such a good choice when you have a group of friends over...or is it?
We were having a night out with some friends! Had drinks at home, called uber, hit the bars and had a great time and then came home and we crashed! As we woke up we were obviously starving, hadn't tried Streets of New York so we thought hey this is perfect we can order food stay in and watch Netflix! (No \"chilling\" LOL) 
When I called the girl who answered the phone didn't appear ready to take my order or really know what she was doing. I could tell she was young but hats no excuse. As I asked her a few basic questions I didn't get the the most speediest of replies that I would like. She needed to place me on hold as she was taking my order...my perception was that I was on hold longer than necessary but that was perhaps due to the fact that I was already upset by the way she was handling my order...now at this point I should not have placed my order because I could just feel it was not going to be right however, I proceeded on! So at the end of the ordering process I asked her to repeat my order and she did and I felt OK. At the beginning I asked if there were specials and she told me but when it came time to pay the price was significantly different, she had to get a manager because \"she did not know what was going on?\" Ok whatever I thought lets just get this done I have a house full of hungry friends LOL! So it was done and they deliver- 30-45 minutes that's pretty reasonable I thought. An hour and 25 minutes later there was a knock on the door...FINALLY FOOD!!!! The delivery guy was on point he was funny and really made it a great time and his service was AWESOME. I had to tell him about the girl in the phone and I let him know how I felt he gets 10 stars out of 5 stars!  he was great even though I was complaint about his fellow co worker he was great at not throwing her under the bus and never \" agreed \" with with what i was saying but you could tell in his face this was not the first time he had heard this. He pulled out the receipt and asked is this your address I replied no and he says oh ok that explains why I was driving around and couldn't find it. Really? The girl who took the order totally go it wrong! I tipped very well and he was great! Now the food , pizza was ok not warm obviously but taste was good we ordered 2 pepperoni and it was good - ok but not great- at this point we were just starving! Now we get to the 2nd box and to our surprise it's a whole different type of pizza and I'm like really? Man....we couldn't even eat it it was completely not ours.. I didn't have the energy to call and complain so we just sucked it up and made pb and j's. The girl on the telephone had us starving. Because of that I have to give one star maybe take your time on the phone next time and hit the right button and then it will be right... The delivery guy made up for this!! Streets of New York=streets of hungry."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery.  Delivery was quick.  Delivery guy was nice and friendly.  Food was hot.

Unfortunately the white pizza I ordered was mostly dry and the cheese was mostly burned.  Not even close to a New York pizza by any standard.

I thought this place was rated for pizza??? Don't understand. 

The artichoke dip was decent as was the toscana."}

Isn't it crazy how management comments on positive reviews and doesn't say anything of complaints, obviously a franchise with a terrible franchisee, no customer service skills or common sense."}
{"text":"Love this place . When I get to get something good and salty . They pasta , Pizza and Cheese stick Sub . Are the Best. Don't forget to order Garlic Bread"}
{"text":"I came here because I got a coupon when I first moved to the area. I ordered 1 large and 1 small pizza. The price was outrageous. I ordered thin crust. It tasted like a cardboard box and I swear there was barely if any cheese. All you can taste was the sauce. My daughter who loves pizza told me never to order from here again. Go to Broadway pizza. Way better."}
{"text":"This is probably the best pizza I've ever had so don't skip it for your own good!!!! The staff was kind, the service was quick and we were treated very well! I would totally recomend this place for a famlies night out, or a date, or an anniversary dinner! Don't miss out. 10/10"}
{"text":"Had a taste for pizza, and after just coming home from NYC I have been on the quest to find authentic NYC pizza. 
A few people told me thier pizza was good, and after falling in love Spinato's pizza, and finding out they were closed on Monday's I decided to give Streets of New York pizza a try.
I should have waited until Tuesday when Spinato's was open.
Streets of NY Pizza was mediocre. Nothing like NY Pizza but better than Pizza Hut (I stay away from major chains).
I was disappointed.
Ordered my pizza to go, the server at the bar was only 18 and talking about all her \"personal\" boyfriend business with another customer.
Felt like it was very unprofessional, but then again--she was only 18.

It was $2 per topping. My pizza was over $20. I think it was overpriced for the quality.
I probably would have been better off waiting until Tuesday to visit Spinato's (which TRULY is good pizza) or went to the Groceries and bought a Digiorno pizza."}
{"text":"Came across this place by accident. Tried the pizza - it was great.  As well, the staff were super friendly.  They have \"thin\" crust and gluten free.  I will go back !!"}
{"text":"I don't understand all the bad reviews! We went there for an early Sat night dinner, and the service was excellent, even tho the place was more than half full. I wish I had gotten our servers name; male, dark hair, 20-ish. Food was great as usual. They have the best meatballs in town!"}
{"text":"Went to the restaurant tonight.  Stood at the hostess station for 5 mins until finally asking if we seat ourselves.  It seemed like we bothered the girl behind the counter and she said \"yeah, you can sit at the tables over there\" and pointed.  We pulled up a chair from another table  (as there was only one).  We sat down and waited...and waited...and after 10 mins with no one even seeing us, we got up and left.  What a complete fail of a restaurant.  Not sure what the manager was doing but customer service was the least of his/her priorities."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I live far from any pizza delivery places but Streets of New York so our room mates have delivered from the Signal Butte location a few times and everytime I have had a slice of the pizza its been very very soggy! I decided maybe we need to go into a location and maybe itll be more fresh but I was soooooo wrong we ordered a Dinner garden salad by far the worse salad ever mostly ice berg lettuce and none cut up veges that were old, then a slice of pizza and the worse wings ever. So soggy were not hot at all. Dont ever go there I suggest to go to Venezias!"}
{"text":"When I want pizza  I go here  great place. They use to send out flyers in mail with discount coupons, but haven't seen one in long time. Need to do that again"}
{"text":"How happy I have been with the new Streets of New York team. My fiance and I had banned this restaraunt, vowing never to return again after the HORRIBLE service we had gotten numerous times!  We would order a pizza for pick up then arrive and have to wait an extra 45min, the employees would be eating and not giving us service, one time my fiance asked for his money back and they didn't even question him or apoligize!! Ya, that was fun. But I am happy to report those days are in the past!

A new manager took over, fired all the old staff and put some awesome people in. After almost 2 years of banning , I can proudly say it is  one of my favorite pizza places again. Everytime we order to go it is always ready for us and perfect!

So, for those of you who banned this Streets, know that they are back on point."}
{"text":"This pizza used to be the best pizza hands down in the valley. Over the past 4-5 years, quality has plummeted. Pizza was dry, little sauce, crust was horrible. Wings were mediocre but definite the best thing about the meal. They used to serve decent size bread sticks that were to die for, now they are scrawny little hard pieces of dough. PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR BILL...we ordered a 16\" pizza and 24 wings and we're told it would be $35. After receiving the boll, I quietly said to the manager that their TV monitor clearly said $29 all day, every day . The manager got defensive and said \"what do you want me to watch the tv\"? I said sure. She viewed it while standing at our table and finally said \"I guess I need to adjust.\" She claimed to have called corporate but she wasn't on the phone long enough.  :-)  I'm calling b.s. on that one. Whose pocketing the $6 at the end of the night?  BEWARE!!"}
{"text":"I picked up the pizza slice lunch special and I got a huge drink and a huge slice of pizza ! It was so good !!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Awesome service that's friendly and fast. I got 2 slices of cheese pizza which were big and tasty. The side garden salad with ranch was awesome. I love the peppers they add."}
{"text":"Just spent over 15 minutes trying to place an order for delivery. I understand the person taking my info may very well be new, although this wasn't specified. Gave my delivery info 3 times, put on hold, cross streets 2 times put on hold once. First item ordered was asked to hold on, came back so you want blah,blah? Yes, still took an additional 2 times to get right. Second item two #3's on wheat, toasted, put in hold again ,asked for sides 1 chip, 1 fries. Third item a number 7, on white, toasted put on hold. She came back said subs are buy one get one free recommend get another sub, so I got another #7 exactly the same. Order complete,  repeats back so 2 number 2's ham and cheese? No, I ordered 2 number 3's oh you want 6 subs and add the number 3's ? No, that is what I ordered the number 3's. No ham and cheese. This confusion was repeated two more times put on hold, someone else gets on the line. I repeated the entire order gave my card info. I asked if this total reflected the buy one get one. oops no I forgot,  didn't get put on hold ,he yelled out what should I do? Came back on line gave me the corrected total about $ 22 dollars less. Great, so you're only charging my card the new total? No, I had already processed it for the first amount, you should see it on your card in about 5 or 6 days. No apologies, I asked they didn't inform me this is what happened, oh and it will be over an hour before it can be delivered. This  entire experience was beyond frustrating. Strike 2 Streets the first one the location at 59th and Thunderbird served our table spoiled pasta salad before it had been closed, been going to Streets since high school so disappointed."}
{"text":"Streets of New York is on our side of town and we come here or order take out from here once a month.  They make a great, high-quality pizza that we always enjoy."}
{"text":"Service is slow.....very very slow. And there were only three other tables of customers. Food is fair at best. We have been here a few times and it never improves. We try and support our local Anthem businesses but doubt we will be back."}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty bomb here. Barro's if you want the real thing."}
{"text":"Fried chicken was very moist and super crispy, just delicious.  We also had the Margarita /Neapolitin pizza which was fantastic.  Service was very friendly, fast and attentive.  I would certainly make a return visit. Oh and they have 6 tvs to watch just about any sports event."}
{"text":"Omgosh if you love  chicken hands down the best place to get it yes chicken at Italian place omg this chicken is the best ever.,,.......... they have us for life customers now"}
{"text":"Another great experience and delicious pizza. We were able to seat ourselves and that is ALWAYS, ALWAYS a plus. Excellent service and they bring out bite sized bread sticks while you wait! Great idea cuz the smell of cooking pizza will absolutely stir one's hunger. They too were delicious. Had a Kilt Lifter for $4 which is unheard of. It was a great visit and we are going to give delivery a try next time."}
{"text":"we had this pizza delivered to our friends hotel room whilst visiting one evening. although the wait time was 45 minutes, we were drinking so it was no worries. after clarifying the location, the delivery went to the wrong hotel. well, no worries there because we all get lost at times. 

but the pizza, i thought, was subpar. a margarita pizza with no sauce. i thought all margarita pizza's came with red sauce. that's why we get those because in my previous pizza experience, they load them with red sauce. anyway, i was disappointed and with so many options that we do love, doubtful we'll hit up SONY again."}
{"text":"Definitely not bad; not really good either. It's nice that the garlic knots are complementary and pretty good. Nice discounts offered. Will not be back."}
{"text":"I came back again with my friends tonight for trivia night.  I ordered a Cobb salad and it was the best salad I have had in a long time!  It filled the bowl it was served in.  It was loaded with sliced eggs, lots of bacon, cheese and delicious chicken!  What an improvement over my last visit.  Now, when I am craving a salad, I have a new favorite place to visit.  Thanks for exceeding my expectations tonight!"}
{"text":"Worst pizza tonight!Toppings were sparse on Margherita pizza and Mediterranean that I took out. Not happy with this place at all."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Mesa the Canadian bacon and pineapple the best and don't forget the lasagna it's excellent. The staff is friendly and the restaurant very clean recommend it to others"}
{"text":"We've been to streets of New York before at the centennial hills location and it was good.  Our experience here was poor.   Easy location to get to.  We walked in and the place was empty maybe it was the warrior cavalier game but empty nonetheless.   I ordered Caesar salad and pasta.   When the salad came, the lettuce had started to rot (turning red and black).  So we sent it back for another.  One would assume that the next when would come back in excellent shape but it came back worse than the 1st.   So I nixed the salad and had my pasta which was ok.   Don't know if we would give this location a 2nd chance.  The only reason we would consider is bc we had a much better experience at the other location."}

{"text":"Best Pizza Pie in the Valley!

My new fav is the thin crust with pepperoni...Canadian Bacon....sausage!!  Try it you will become a fan also......that is unless your dating a Vegen!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very quick and delicious delivery!! Pizza and wings were super hot with plenty of sauce. Salad was fresh and delicious as well. Definitely will be ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"Its a small joint but oohhh is it ever sentimental.  The pizza is delicious and the subs are equally divine!   I had not been back to this location since High School days at Shadow Mtn.   

I have never had a bad pie at Streets of NY!"}
{"text":"First time eating here about a week ago, we have a toddler and 2 kids , were starving so stopped in to try some of their pizza. It has good atmosphere to it. It took a long time to get drinks ordered. We were told crayons and paper would be brought, it never came, we tried to ask but there was only 1 server on duty and at least 6 other tables besides ours. By the time we got our pizza the kids and us were starving. Must've been at least 45 minutes - because I was able to attend a 35 minute conference on my phone which was over long before pizza came. We asked the server why she was only one on duty and she said there is only ever 1 person during the day. The only reason I give 3 stars is because the pizza was delicious! Hubby got philly steak, I got Margarita, and the kids got cheese. The server was very nice but it should not take 2 hours to eat pizza. With 1-1/2!total waiting time. If there were more servers I'm sure it wouldn't have taken so long."}
{"text":"There pizza is ok, Nooot New York style the slice is too thick."}
{"text":"We planned a casual wedding rehearsal dinner at Streets of New York, near the site of the wedding. We live 600 miles away, so I had to make all plans by phone/email. The restaurant and its manager were great! The tables were set up and we were ready to go as soon as the wedding party arrived. All I did was embellish the tables a bit with some sparkly confetti, and it looked festive and inviting. The presentation was great, and so was the food! We had  crisp, fresh green salads and wonderful breadsticks. We ate a delicious baked ziti pasta, along with a number of outstanding regular-crust pizzas. We loved the Mediterranean pizza! We also had the New York, meat-eaters, vegetarian, Hawaiian, and a special one with pesto, feta, and sliced tomatoes. Each one was great! We ate our fill and had plenty left to save and munch on later. The service was superlative. I highly recommend Streets of New York on East Germann Rd. as a great place to get together with friends to enjoy some terrific food!"}
{"text":"I gotta say, I had a less than desirable experience tonight. Hubby and I were craving spaghetti, and our favorite place is closed weds nights. We live down the street, so figured we would order spaghetti to go and eat it at home. 

We called and asked if we should split an entree of spaghetti, or should we order 2. We were told that we would definitely want 2. So we ordered 2 bolognese with spaghetti noodles, and a side of garlic bread. The portion was HUGE. not sure if whomever we spoke with is used to feeding Giants or what, but we easily could have split the entree. That's really not a big deal, just a difference of opinion I guess. 

The spaghetti was BEYOND overcooked. It was so mushy, that when you chewed it, you couldn't even tell the different noodles in your mouth. It just turned to mush. The noodles fell apart as you were twirling them on your fork. The sauce, left a LOT to be desired. I personally would take prego or ragu over that sauce. It was watery and bland and had very little meat. They advertise Italian sausage pieces in it. I received one in my entire entree.  the garlic bread wasn't even toasted, and was soggy and terrible tasting. 

I've had streets of new yorks pizza before (different location) and it wasn't bad. I'm not sure if this particular location sucks, or if all the SONY's have awful pasta, but I will never go here again, and would be hesitant to even send an enemy there. 

Worst $25 I've spent in a long time."}
{"text":"My husband and I have gone here multiple times so I figured it was time for a review. Yesterday I was thinking about ravioli all day and I knew they could satisfy my craving. We arrived around 6PM, and I was surprised to see how busy they were on a Tuesday night. There was only one waitress and while we got our drinks pretty quickly, it took her quite a while to get around to take our order. No big deal, it was just her hustlin' all those tables. I got the cheese ravioli and the streets fries and my husband got wings. I really like the ravioli, despite the marinara being a bit bland. It's okay because I smother it in more parmesan anyway! We always have good food here and the service is usually not too bad. I recommend the passion cookie-I skipped out on getting one last night and now I'm regretting it! I think they're better than pizookies."}
{"text":"NO CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!

I called in to order delivery today, after ordering from there a couple of weeks ago. I placed my order and the person on the other side of the call was very nice and helpful, and quoted me a delivery time between 45-55 minutes. I called back 1 hour and 15 minutes later, asking for the status on my order. After about 10 minutes on hold the person came back on the phone and said \" uh I guess we don't deliver to you, and our delivery guy tried to call you twice 30 minutes ago or so ago and you didn't answer\" I then checked my records and saw that there was no missed calls at all, and after asking her to repeat my number on file back to me and verifying that it was correct I asked to speak with a manager. She said not a problem and hung up on me. I called right back and she answered again and as soon as I started talking she hung up again..

NO CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!
This totally ruined this place and the whole chain for me. I guess now I know."}
{"text":"I loved the whole shopping center this restaurant was placed in. It's so cute and gives me the California beach shop or New York store front vibes.  It's a perfect spot for a date, so cute.

The restaurant is pretty cute inside. Feels true to a New York pizzeria.

We came here to participate in the trivia night that they have every Monday night at 7pm. It's very fun!

We ordered pepperoni & ricotta cheese pizza with Caesar salad and both were very tasty! No complaints about the food. I thought it was a little overpriced for pizza ( we spent about $50 for 4 people no drinks) but it was okay. 

The waiter comes by often to make sure we're okay so service was good and they were nice as well."}
{"text":"Got a recommendation for the Streets of New York from someone above my pay grade at work, so I kind of felt obligated to go and report back. Great recommendation. I loved the atmosphere and location. The 80's music playing in the background was a nice touch. This place puts off a great \"hang out\" vibe. Our party of four left satisfied with plenty left over for a cold pizza breakfast. Yummy! The combination pizza was loaded with the traditional faire and the sausage was bursting with flavor. We got both pies with a traditional crust. The prices were comparable with other pizza places. Don't forget to check-in on Yelp first and get your free basket of delicious french fries. I can see this becoming a regular pizza joint for this Yelper in the future."}
{"text":"The pizza was okay, not the best I've had. Tasted like cafeteria pizza. It was pretty basic. I also got bone in baked wings and asked for hot. But the ones I got weren't hot At all. They had some kind of sauce on it that tasted like teriyaki sauce and had chili peppers in it. Not sure if that is what their \"hot\" is. Was looking for something more traditional."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza and wings for delivery tonight and was really disappointed.  It is Friday and I expected it to take some time. We ordered on line and they said it would take 55 min. The delivery order to 85 min to arrive and when it did the pizza and wings were cold. I called the store and spoke to the manager who did promptly refund the price of the delivery. The thing is that this was my second time trying then out--last time was about a year ago, and I had the EXACT same experience! 
I appreciated the refund, but will never try Streets of New York again."}
{"text":"Great place to enjoy pizza night with family! Good service and decent food. We will be back."}
{"text":"Me and my wife were staying at the hotel across the street and we were starving so we stopped by for a quick dinner. It was like 45 mins till close and I hate to walk into sit down restaurants that closely to close. But I forgot our servers name but she was amazing! She was in the middle of closing when we walked in and she immediately stopped what she was doing and came and helped us. She was also one of the best servers EVER! She was helpful but not overly helpful and talkative like alot of servers. Now the food! The food came out in under 20 mins and it's was pipping hot and delicious :)"}
{"text":"Food was good, as you would expect at SoNY, but what was exceptional was Sam, our server.  He was attentive, friendly and very patient with my son."}
{"text":"My name is Ian. I am 7 years old and my mom is teaching me how to use yelp. I would like to say Streets of New York on Norman Rockwell has the best pizza in the world. They also have a great patio, a happy hour and the people are really nice."}
{"text":"New York Combo.  Decent use of $20. Also the pizza warmed up and tasted okay next couple days (necessary for a bachelor :)"}
{"text":"Thank you krista for giving us great service you were awesome! Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Great service and pizza. This is a tiny restaurant, so small the bathrooms are outside. Our waiter was very friendly and gave us free garlic bread - which is always a bonus. Our pizza and wings came out fast and were very tasty. 
They definitely do more take out business than sit down.  I would highly recommend Streets of NY for take out. Also, this would be fun place to try when the weather is nicer because the patio looks cute."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here and the food was delicious especially the chicken wings!!!  Some of the best wings I have ever had... Pizza was excellent as well, and I love the family atmosphere here...  I'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"Couldn't get to my normal Streets tonight because I was on the other side of the valley so I decided to try this one..... I came in expecting the same delicious food and the same family owned atmosphere... I was not disappointed.... I got the lasagna with cheese bread and an adult beverage. It was perfect. The server, I forgot to get his name, was friendly and helpful. Overall it was a great dinner. Now I know I can get my streets of New York fix on either side of the valley and that is a good think...   Thanks for yet another delicious dinner Streets.."}
{"text":"My friend had been raving about this place for months before I gave it a try. 
I had been craving potato Skins for weeks and they just happened to be on special so I ordered that and a slice. Way too much food but totally worth it. The pizza has great flavor. The crust was seasoned with a garlic butter sauce that is absolutely amazing. 
Service is very friendly and I can't wait to try the location closer to me.
This specific Streets of New York is located in the cutest little area. Norman Rockwell lane,  I mean does it get cuter? 
 It was a little too cold when we went, but the patio looked nice."}
{"text":"I am going to say that this place restored my failth in S.O.N.Y. pizza. My last visit in the far N valley was gross. 

This pizza was great, good flavor, good crust, good service."}
{"text":"I was never a huge fan anyway. 

Lunch here was, simple, quick and pretty good. The crust was thin yet thick and crispy. The toppings were fresh and plentyful. The sauce was a little lacking but I like sauce. 

The dining room was very nice, the patio looked nice, the servers were very attentive. In fact he asked 2 times if everything was good and refilled the H20 1 time. 

I would go back and try some pasta next time."}
{"text":"Hands down some of the best pizza on this side of town. The wings are good and the service is fast. I have been to other SNYs before and they oddly enough do not compare to this one."}
{"text":"I called this location to order a pizza for delivery. I was staying at the La Quinta down the street. I received a message stating this location had been closed. They did provide two other locations and numbers for their other locations that could assist me. I did call one of their other stores, I am writing a review for that store separately. 

I am only giving it 1 star due to it being closed (why rate my past experiences at this location now)."}
{"text":"Came here with my husband to check out the pizza.  We're from New York always looking for great pizza to try in Vegas.  The assistant manager waited on us and had a great personality.  We got a slice with meatball and onion with a side salad.  Both were fresh and delicious.  We can't wait to come back and try other menu selections."}
{"text":"Four stars only because I want to come back and eat here again in the restaurant and not just do pick up.

The pizza was good- we got thin crust. I'm not a massive sauce person, but I did feel they need a bit more sauce on the pizza. Next time we'll order extra sauce and see how that goes. 

There was a pick up coupon on the Yelp so that they wouldn't honor. It's not a big deal- we were just told they aren't honoring coupons anymore.

Tried the cannoli- very yum.

While we waited for our pick up order I flipped through the menu which looked really nice.

We will be back to eat here Again."}
{"text":"I'm also a bit torn on this place. I've been here a few times and the food is relatively good. The chicken wings are phenomenal while the pizza is actually better at Hungry Howie's. The service for the most part has been quite good except for my encounter on Friday.  We decided to do a take-out order.  When we arrived, there was a guy at the register who was nice and friendly. However, he was chewing gum like there will be no tomorrow. I believe that this is a health code violation since he handled food.  I let his gum chomping be and a few minutes after I placed the order, I noticed that I had a text coupon on my phone. At this point, the manager was at the front counter and I asked her if she can take a look at the my order so I can possibly get the discount.  The manager swiftly asked if I had already paid for the order which I said that I did. She said, \"well there is nothing I can do because you already paid for the order!\"  What do you mean there is nothing you can do?! Cancel the order, refund my money, and place a new order. Just tell the cook in the back not to make the duplicate.  The manager should have expressed more empathy and said, \"Oh I'm sorry about that, let me see what I can do. What pizza did you order? Oh, I am sorry but you ordered the 16\" pizza but the coupon is good for the 14\".  For your trouble, I'll deduct a buck or two from your order, or give you some breadsticks but next time we would appreciate if you can let us know ahead of time if you will use a coupon.\"  I'm not really sure if I'll be back to this place anytime soon solely based on my last experience."}
{"text":"Great tasting pizza! Not bad prices either. Just sometimes get confused about how to order when I come in (usually not during a meal rush). But overall great experience!"}
{"text":"Pretty average food here, not all that good, but tolerable. I wouldn't claim that it is authentic New York pizza, it's just the name to get people to come in. Pizza is mediocre, atmosphere seems loud all the time, but service is usually good. Did my 13th birthday party here years ago when I thought it was better, but there's better pizza places out there"}
{"text":"I'm surprised there is not a review already about this Street of New York in Anthem.  But then again, most people won't complain about there experiences and just not go back. Hense ~ the purpose of this review. 

The good~ after all there is always some \"good\" in just about everything.  This is an awesome location in Anthem.  They are located in the Frys center.  They are reasonably priced compared to other places with similar food.  They never have a wait to be seated.  Te food is not great but it's not too bad either. 

The bad~ the service in this place is soooooo slow.  Whether you're dinning solo, with two or as a family the wait is the same ~ slow-ville X2. The staff is not very accommodating and heaven forbid if someone comes in they know while they are serving you.  They will make more time for their friends than you.  

So why give them 2 stars and not 1 star?  Because the dinning options in Anthem are pathetic and I am not a pessimist but rather a critical optimist in hopes they will get their act together some day..."}
{"text":"I guess I forgot to review this place... so here goes.

Whole household came here for dinner on a Friday night.  Had to wait to be seated even though I saw a few tables open...  but I guess the wait wasn't too bad.

Ordered wings, they were okay.  Overcooked though.  I guess everyone else liked them fine cuz they scarfed em down!

Pizza was okay... but I wouldn't come back for it.

Service was decent.

I would go somewhere else for pizzeria food... (my fav place that I keep mentioning), but if everywhere else was closed I would come here.  LOL..."}
{"text":"I rarely ever give a bad review, but the pizza at this place is WAY over priced and NOT good. I paid $22 for a 14\" pizza thinking that it should be the best ever. (you get what you pay for). I thought I was eating a frozen pizza from Walmart. I should have known when the place was empty at noon. When I asked about a senior discount, they said that you have to ask for it before you order. Anyway, if you want a pizza with perfect crust that will melt in your mouth. Go across the street to Native Wings. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!"}
{"text":"Their quality has gone REALLY down hill. The (owner? manager?) is very quick to try and make things right, but I swear I cannot tell the difference between theirs and Dominos. In fact, I thought they had run out of pizza, and stopped by Dominos and sold me that for S. of NY price. I have had 3 bad experiences there with the bad pizzas. Service is nice, food less than acceptable. I coulda figured that out as I never see any cars in their parking lot (no customers)"}
{"text":"Their pizza is fantastic. My sister and I make a habit of going there every Friday for pizza and beer - but they stopped stocking Peroni!!! I like the fact that you can sit outdoors on the patio and smoke and have your beer and pizza.

There's a new server at the Glendale location that thinks she is working at the Four Seasons Resort. A laid back beer and pizza day with family turned into a big production with her constant coming to the table and then went on some long drawn out \"dessert list\" (?!) at a pizza joint? Give me a break. We just wanted to sit down and enjoy our beers. 

On the BIG plus side, they now have online ordering!! The site FAILS to mention how late they deliver."}
{"text":"Kitchen was \"backed up\" so we had pasta with no bread. Took over an hour to get food so I am pretty certain bread can be cooked in an hour. Waitress was inattentive, the only reason we knew of the delay was because we asked."}
{"text":"This was the second time eating their food. First time we dined in. The broaster chicken was great.
This time we had it delivered. Called the restaurant directly. Ordered a 12 piece broaster meal. It came with 2 small sides,
6 potato wedges and bread. The chicken itself was very good, however, because delivery took 70 minutes, by the time I got it, it was no longer crispy. The chicken pieces were so small, they must have their own stock of midget chickens. I have never seen thighs so small. The salads were tasty, however not enough to feed he amount necessary for  12 pieces of chicken. All in all, I might eat in their restaurant again if I happen to be in the area, but will NEVER have it delivered. For $36 it was pretty expensive for what we got."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try Streets of NY. We were craving for pizza. We usually order our favorites(Lou's or Federals) but decided to try something different. Ordered a large pizza (half and half of pepperoni and Mediterranean) and a chicken salad for delivery. It was pricier than what I usually would pay but told myself it probably is worth it. Pizza came on time. I had my first slice.
Then tried the salad. Chicken was raw. Totally ruined my appetite. Could no longer eat another slice of pizza after taking a bite of the raw chicken. Tried calling them but they were already closed."}
{"text":"Happy to finally get to try Streets of New York! The cheesesteak was phenomenal! Steak is so tender and they add Alfredo- never would have thought to add Alfredo to a cheesesteak. It was spot on!

My husband had their \"Broasted Chicken\" hands down the best fried chicken I have ever tasted. So tender, juicy and flavorful. 

The Passion Cookie is to die for! Served straight from the oven. Big enough to share!

We live on the complete opposite side of town and will absolutely be making the drive back out for dinner!"}
{"text":"Last night I had ordered the $20 special which is a16\" pizza and 24wings with one pitcher of beer I had split the tab but our bartenderAJ had charged us double after he \"fixed\" it once it came out to $58.92 look at receipt in picture reviews."}
{"text":"This is a small, quiet and comfortable pizza place that channels old New York with city decor. The seating consist of square tables and chairs-very simple and straight to the point. I must say that this location is hard to find because it is tucked away in the corner of the plaza. The menu had excellent choices for pasta, subs and pizza at reasonable prices. The time it took to make our 10\" pepperoni-pineapple pizza was sensible. I truly enjoyed every bite!!!"}
{"text":"At the Suns game and for the first time in 40 years of games we are in the section that wins something and we get free pizza from Streets. Hooray but wait. The coupon says it's only good tonight at the game. No worries we are off to get our pizza. Stand in line and get to the front but no pizza. Apparently you have to have the box even though it doesn't say you need the box on the coupon. Manager says she needs it for inventory. Really?  I have done inventory my entire life and a three year old could figure this out. Back to get the box and back in line but oh no they are out of pizza. Of course you can go to the other side of the stadium where they might have some.  What a joke and worse the manager was a total witch. Way to kill it.   Long time Streets customer who is now DONE with them for a long time. Losers!!!"}
{"text":"The food is decent, but not wow--and for the price it should be wow.

I'm also unhappy with their delivery--over multiple experiences, delivery times have been much longer than indicated, ordered items have been missing, and when I've called, the promised correction was not made."}
{"text":"All my friends love this place because they like the beer and the snacks, but i 'm not a fan. At times they take long , short staff and food is not the best. all in all i go to this place because my friends and i found a good hang out spot."}
{"text":"Working in Downtown Phoenix, I have many options for lunch but I usually end up finding myself at Streets of New York.  The manager - Jimmy is an extremely friendly gentleman who always greets us with a smile and a handshake.  Our server Lupe takes care of us like no other.  We never wait for refills or food, we're always in and out quickly.  All of the food here is good from the wings to the sandwiches and broaster chicken.  We've been coming here for years and it's never been bad.

If you're in the area and wanting good quality food, definitely stop in and have lunch at this Streets location.  I've been to a few other locations throughout the valley but none of them measure up to the consistency, quality and friendly staff that exists at the Camelback location."}
{"text":"A very nice establishment that I like to frequent for lunch. The customer service is great and the food taste good. They definitely have some of the best wings in the area!"}
{"text":"It has been about 6 years since we dined at streets of New York. This time we ordered a thin and crispy pizza, a Caesar salad and bread knots. From my memory the pizza was better than I remember but not great.   However, the salad was not edible in fact we took it back.  The romain was brown and at least 4 or five days past it's prime.   They took it back without any Question and comped us a piece cheesecake in good faith.  Who ever prepared our meal should be totally embarrassed....        I don't think we will go back.."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Took almost 2 hours to get food after they told me 45-60 minutes. And pizza was nasty at this location."}
{"text":"Placed an online order for pickup and the order was incorrect. I sent my daughter to pick it up, so when she arrived with the pizza we noticed that one of the pizzas was small not large, and another pizza didn't have the added ingredient I requested. Decent tasting pizza though."}
{"text":"i tried this place for mother's day and was disappointed unfortunately, immediately when i seen our menus they were dirty and sticky and needed to wiped down. The menu didn't have anything exciting on it, very boring. Wish i hadn't eaten here since when i looked around the whole place was pretty filthy :(

Service was mediocre, look guys if you see the table could use some pre-bussing DO IT! i shouldn't have to ask for you to clear out the dirty dishes from our table.. nobody likes to have piles of used plates around while your eating your entrees.

bottom line, drive 3 minutes away to Rosati's"}
{"text":"They were convenient to where we were and the food was great not the fastest service but very friendly and nice and again great food it's also Black Friday conference knock too hard but my kids and wife also were there me was a great experience for lol I us well worth it we'd recommend this location for sure !!! Great spot!"}
{"text":"What nice folks ! They sent me a birthday e-mail for a wonderful desert my wife & I will share.....had the usual swell lunch of a side salad ( that required a fork lift to pick up...it was so big & delicious ), and a side of meatballs...perfect sauce , too !  Tanya always  makes us feel welcome and knocks it outta the park w / heads-up service ! Needless to say we'll be back !"}
{"text":"This was an order to go review. 

I ordered a plain pep pizza was hot and yummy upon arrival. Their chicken... YUM! Juice, hot just good!!!!! Seasoned perfectly. Just yummy, their potatoes are crispy and moist. 

Their chocolate cake! OMG for chocolate lovers please get this! Moist and just so good!!!! Amazing with cold milk! 



I ordered from Grub Hub which I will just order any other way. I will definitely be ordering again from here."}
{"text":"Ordered an 18 inch pizza with pepperoni, black olives, mushrooms on the pizza and bacon on one half with a side of ranch with $5 tip it came to $39 and some change.  We ordered it at 10:42 am on a Sunday morning and it took over an hour and we on 7th Street and Indian school. I was very disappointed in the pizza for the price I thought it was really flavorless. Won't be coming here again."}
{"text":"Our team ordered a pizza while we were in a business meeting and the guys were great in delivering it on time. As a bonus the pizza was great. I'm usually a stickler when it comes to crust, and this stuff was great. The only thing I didn't like was that the margarita had tomatoes on it and not tomato sauce. Just a personal preference. Also wish they added the basil leaves at the end to keep it from fully cooking/charing.

We'll be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat pizza in Mesa! The other food here is okay. I've had the Italian beef a few times and sometimes it is good and other times just edible.

We usually have good service and the prices aren't too bad."}
{"text":"For a great pizza joint across the street, this can't be beat. The atmosphere is always relaxed. Not loud or boisterous. If you're not satisfied they'll make it right. Beer and wine available and a few good desserts too. The pizza crust is superb!"}
{"text":"Best veggie pizza ever. Gotta say the best location is 44th/Camelback based on my experience."}
{"text":"Always a solid spot to go for lunch or happy hour great deals, service and good food for a local company run store. Also a great go to if you have a last minute group of people coming over for a game with there broasted. Chicken"}
{"text":"Normally I outline the ups and downs on my reviews. No ups here. Service was non existent. 12 minutes from butt in seat to greet, 37 minutes for the food. Half the food blazing hot, other half barely room temp. Once the food had arrived they forgot a pizza. Then we hear the server and kitchen directly behind us argue about who's fault it is and that it's needed on the fly. 15 minutes later pizza arrived. Service was gone. Had to get up and grab our own to go containers and flag some random worker down for a check. The forgotten pizza was still on the bill. Nothing discounted, no manager visit or sever apology(any one would make it seem like they somewhat cared) Meanwhile the staff there including managers stood in the bar area chatting and watching the tv's. Never again will I visit this location and likely any other one. 18 years working in food/beverage/hospitality and this cracked the top 5 in worst restaurant experiences. Avoid it"}
{"text":"NO NO AND MORE NO. Ugh. Not happy. With any of the experience. & that's a shame, because lord knows im always looking forward to pizza!

First off, the seating area in this place is literally the size of my bedroom. Even fully seated one server could handle that place. I think they have more room for seating outside on the patio, not that anyone can use that when its 100 in October! We came here for dinner last night at 530, and only one other table was seated. That alone should have been a red flag. However, I of course had a groupon that was about to expire, so we had to use it! The waitress had to have been new, that or just was terrible at her job. She had to walk away from the table to get an answer to every question I asked.

We ordered the spinach artichoke dip, not that great. It was just okay. My son got the single extra large slice, which fyi, is NOT extra large. Its a normal size slice. My mom and I got the white pizza and added chicken. Literally the most flavorless pizza ever. All I could taste was garlic. Not impressed. I also had to chase the girl down twice for a water refill, even though we were her only table. Luckily the groupon cut the bill down, but even at a discount was not worth the money. Also, unless the girl was wrong, they only have Coors on tap? Who the heck drinks that crap, and why would a place have 1 beer on tap? ODD. 

I would NOT come back to this location, nor recommend it. When there are SO many good pizza places to choose from in Phoenix (especially downtown where I live) places like this aren't going to make it. I would consider trying the Camelback location, which I know is much larger (and closer to me) but will not be coming back to the Cactus one."}
{"text":"Definitely could have been better but I've had far worse, so 3 stars it is. Saw the reviews online so wasn't expecting to be wowed but was silently hoping I would be. I really gave an effort too. I ordered a slice first. Regular slice. Unusual to get just 1 slice, so I was happy. $2.50 for a slice, not to bad. So far, I'm so happy!
The cheese should have been melted more, and it was just OK. The sauce was eh. I like a sauce that's kinda sweet and compliments the cheese and dough. They serve Coke products instead of Pepsi, so I'll definitely try it again, for that alone. I got a personal pie thin crust to go, topped with pineapple, onion and mushroom. It was more like a cracker than a thin crust, so I was disappointed. And the way they sliced it, ew. I did NOT like that. I dont like when regular pizza has slices that dont have crust. They try to make it like 9 \"slices\" but some a teeny tiny, some have no crust. If I wanted then I would have ordered Sicilian, where that's more acceptable. 
Service was great. Owner seemed really nice. Place was a little busy when I was there.I'll come back or have a delivery and try it one more time."}
{"text":"My family loves streets for the pizza! Our favorite is the Margarita pizza, my son always goes with the calzone!!"}
{"text":"Love coming here! Lots of stuff on the pizza and soooo good. The sausage and beef are big chunks.  The crust is buttery and crunchy.  Yumminess is yours with streets"}
{"text":"Small spot but very cool... Food was delicious but the coke slaw... WOW!!!!! 
So awesome.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Streets of New York is very popular in the Phoenix, AZ area and the official pizza of the Arizona Diamond Backs, Phoenix Suns and the Arizona State Sun Devil Stadium. Locations around the Phoenix area are in abundance, but we have a couple locations here in Vegas so I decided to finally give them a try. I stopped in to grab some lunch to-go. I noticed the sign saying \"wait to be seated\" so I stood there and waited, looking around for an employee and didn't see one. I noticed only 1 table with customers inside, so they weren't busy and it was odd that no employees were visibly present at first. After about 5 minutes a girl came out from the back and asked if I was picking up or ordering. I asked if they had any lunch specials or a menu to look at and she gave me a menu and said she'd be back in a few to take my order. After I placed my order it took 25 minutes for the food to finally be ready. It was just 2 cheese slices and that's it, so I can't figure out why it took so long and it would have been nice if the girl who took my order could have communicated with me by letting me know that it was coming out soon, later, something! I felt like she forgot I was there honestly. I must say that when she did take my order and bring it to me she was nice, but there just could have been better acknowledgment so I knew I wasn't forgotten and wondering what was going on. 

Lunch specials are daily from 10:30 am - 2:30 pm. 

Drinks didn't come with any of the lunch specials and cost $2.90 each.

2 slices with one topping ($6.50) - I didn't want any toppings, just cheese and it still cost me the same price. Most places have a special for cheese slices with drink at a certain price and then they offer slices with one topping and a drink for just a little more. No price difference here they charged me the same regardless. If you want additional toppings it's $.60 each. No drinks come with any of the lunch specials which makes the $6.50 price tag a bit high for this area. It's not a combo or special if it doesn't come with a drink in my opinion and by the time the cost of a drink is tacked on, I might as well go down the street to Metro Pizza instead. The pizza was below average. It's absolutely beyond me why this place is called Streets of New York when the pizza is far from any traditional slice you will find in NY. The slices were not thin, but thick and they weren't shy with the cheese and it was tasty with the seasonings they added on top. The crust was a whole other story and it actually reminded me of frozen Freschetta pizza. I love a nice crispy crust however mine here was hard and dry. Not even the piled and delicious cheese on the top could save the rock hard crust. Maybe it was an off day, but I can't see hurrying back. 

Inside they have booths and tables. Aside from pizza they also have subs and pasta. If you are a fan of Broaster chicken they have that also and you can get just chicken, baskets or family meals."}
{"text":"Happy Hour is an awesome deal, especially if you have Tabetha serving you, she's the best!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. We ordered food for delivery and two hours later, still no food. We called Streets of New York  45 min ago and were told \"the food was out for delivery\" and it would be 10 min. Well, that was a lie. We called back and then were told \"the order just went out\". Again, 45 min after being told it was already out for delivery. We would have canceled the order the first time we called if we knew it was not in fact out for delivery. Very disapointed.  I would prefer no stars for this review. 
We will be challenging this charge as we still never got our food now after over two hours"}
{"text":"There pizza is delicious. It's a little pricey but worth it. When I order pizza I choose Streets Of New York."}
{"text":"Service okay, not great. The server never returned to check how our food was. Cheesesteak and Tuna were outstanding. Server was slow to recognize when we were done. Had to ask for check and box for our food. Coleslaw very good."}
{"text":"This is a much older streets of New York but for some reason it has a little more character for me that I like, and it's more of a  quiet atmosphere then the store on 44th and camelback they also have outdoor seating at this location which is nice and the food is always great my favorite of course is the \"best of everything\" sandwich but great pizza too."}
{"text":"We've given this location a few chances, despite the wings being very dry each time. Regrettably, tonight was the last time. In addition to the wings being dry for the 3rd time, one of the staff happened to be using the ladies room at the same time I was. I don't think she knew there was anyone else in there and she flushed, left the stall and exited the bathroom without washing her hands! After I returned to my seat, I saw her handling menus and getting drink refills and ice. Gross."}
{"text":"Our server Britney was very friendly and the food was great. The Ravioli alfredo is something I will order again, and can't go wrng with the chicken parmagianna. Will dine again."}
{"text":"Top notch Calzone! Can't be beat! Keep it up Streets! Thanks for the awesome service!"}
{"text":"I originally found this place about three years ago although I don't remember how because I don't go in pizza place places much. It's highly possible I was Googling fried chicken and this place popped up so I decided to give it a try. I am so glad I did. 

I came here several times on that trip and was looking forward to coming back here when I got to town recently. I come in for the broasted chicken not the pizza. There's nothing wrong with their Pizza, it's perfectly good, I just don't eat pizza much. But I do love a good crispy juicy broasted chicken and this is the only place I have found that serves the chicken this way, which I call Midwest style because there are so many places in the Midwest that serve broasted chicken. 

They have some specials that are excellent deals and include your choice of a number of pieces of chicken, white or dark, either by itself or with salad, soup, Pizza etc. My favorite has always been the two piece dark meat plate that includes either pasta salad, soup or green salad. Their pasta salad is really good and their soups taste homemade. I haven't asked if they are or not. They used to only carry Italian soups like minestrone and meatball soup but when I went in two days ago they had a butternut squash soup that was wonderful. I'm not a big french fries fan either but I do love them when they're fixed right. They used to serve really good french fries but they have changed them and now they're even better! They are much more like Mojo potatoes if you know what those are. I think they might use the same coating as they use on the chicken and the potatoes come out perfect, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. They don't give you a lot which is fine with me because I don't really want the excess calories. Therefore I can enjoy what I do eat. 

As reasonably priced as they are I almost always take home leftovers, especially if I order soup or pizza with the chicken because that fills me up. The chicken is just as good the next day cold or reheated, though not as crispy. The soup was a little salty to suit me but otherwise delicious. This last time I decided to splurge and get a beer with my dinner which I don't often do. I was really glad I took the waitress's recommendation of the Lifted Kilt beer on tap because it was one of the best beers I've ever had.

The service was excellent--cheerful and responsive. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Not bad for a low $ happy hour.  For the most part, the staff was attentive and was aware of what the patrons needed.  However, it appeared that the manager was not in control of the staff."}
{"text":"Today we ordered in lunch for the office & the birthday girl wanted pizza, wings & salad, so we chose Streets! Yummy yummy pizza! We ordered three 18' pizzas (which were great), 3 antipasto salads, and mild wings! The wings could have had more sauce on it... but other than that, everything was excellent. We got the order delivered to our office & showed up 30 min early, which was okay!"}
{"text":"I thought that the pizza was fine, but not great. Probably somewhere between Pizza Hut and Round Table in terms of quality.

Delivery was on time. No service issues. I wouldn't avoid them in the future."}
{"text":"First time at Streets of New York and I was very pleased. Service was great and our waitress was attentive. This place said they just added a separate lunch menu and it was fairly priced for the quality of food. 
Only thing I can say is that our pizza took a little longer than expected seeing how there was only 4 other tables."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been living in Scottsdale for only 6 weeks, but Streets of NY has quickly become our favorite GoTo spot for pizza. And I can't forget to mention the delicious chocolate chip cookie and ice cream desert. And added plus is the great staff."}
{"text":"Delicious as always! The gluten free pizza was as good as the regular version. More expensive than most places so it is not an everyday choice but worth it. Never disappoints"}
{"text":"I made the wrong choice for dinner tonight.  Ordered and asked that they call before leaving so I can meet them at the hotel lobby.  Did this happen, NO.  Ordered pizza and salad.  Do you think they gave me a fork to eat my salad with, or cheese and peppers for the pizza.  I would think this is basic customer service.  Uhh, failed again.  When I eat my pizza it taste like I could have baked this myself out of a frozen pizza box.  Glad this was my last night in town because I might be giving this pizza a trip down the toilet if I eat it."}
{"text":"I called to order a pizza and wings from this location and my order was taken with no trouble but after waiting an hour and a half for our food WE called back to find out where our food was, and the lady who answered the phone the second time was the RUDEST person i have ever had the DISPLEASURE of attempting to order from . CANCELED and ill never be ordering from this place ever again . Worst customer service ever ."}
{"text":"We'ver ordered out for delievery here twice(never eatten in the resturant itself). Both times though the food was really good..The capicolla sub though is a bit spicier then what we're used too but still great. We love the passion bread and well, we haven't even tried the pizza yet but the pasta is wonderful and I have to say their deserts are great too."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came in here for the first time for dinner. I had Lasagna and my boyfriend had the waiter by the name of Jared build him a pizza it was very good and we had chicken wings. The restaurant was very clean but it felt a little warm in here. I would recommend this place to my friends. We will be back to try their chicken."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and knots. Good ambiance and the service wasnt good but made up for it in friendliness and humor."}
{"text":"Delivery, dine in, or take out. We usually get one thing: Quattro formaggio pizza, well done. It's one of my favorite pizzas ever! I do think they are a little expensive compared to other similar pizza spots but I'm addicted to this pizza so we keep going back. My husband has had their broasters chicken and liked it!"}
{"text":"The pizza was soggy and covered with grease. Waitress was on her phone and was verry rude. Never smiled or greatest us. We were her only table and she took forever to check on us and refill drinks. The manager was sitting and looking at us and never said anything to her to fix the situation. She disappeared often only to come back to stand in front of the window."}
{"text":"Staff friendly and food was good.  They have by far the best chicken wings and pizza I have found in Chandler.  Place is clean (that includes the restrooms) and the waitress was always checking on us (I like that kind of service).  I would reccomed this place to the pickiest pizza lovers."}
{"text":"Just ordered for a quick pickup and it was ready even before the estimated time! Great service with an interior perfect for a family dinner/ cute but simple date. Loved the food also!!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. I really enjoy their pasta salad. I've only ever carried out orders from this location but the service has always been fantastic. I will continue to order here when I'm craving an Italian hoagie!"}
{"text":"The cheese and pepperoni pizza were delicious. The baked wings were big, juicy, and full of flavor. They bring out mini baked bread with marinara while your waiting for the wings and pizza, nice touch."}
{"text":"The hubby and I were out running errands and time was flying buy, we were starving, and I have been on a constant craving for Italian subs (thanks Jersey Mikes!) so I said lets go to streets, we were in that shopping center anyway... I remembered about six years ago, a friend who worked there hooked me up with an Italian sub, and I remembered it being good. I also remembered having pizza from some other Streets location at some point and it was fresh and good also... I didn't feel very skeptical. We were sat but it seemed like we were forgotten for a while, it took like ten minutes before our waitress came (there were only two or three other tables sat, and at least four servers there). I ordered the sub, hubby ordered medium wings. They brought the complementary bread and I realized it was about to be a sucky meal. The bread was old, the marinara was nasty. I got my Caesar about another ten minutes latter, it was also nasty, the dressing was like Kraft or something bottled and low quality, there was the most powerful BO smelling red onion slice on top. The wings and sandwich didn't take as long... The wings were like precooked Tyson frozen wings with some kind of weird glaze, flavored like buffalo sauce. It didn't even look like real wings. The sandwich was soooooooooooooo gross. The bread was gross, the dressing was flavorless... I hate spending money (yeah it wasn't that much, only a $20 lunch for two, but still...) on food that is nasty. Even the water was nasty. It makes me so mad! Only good thing, our waitress was nice.  We should have went to Greek Corner, where I know the food is GOOD!  Streets needs to make their food fresh to start improving..."}
{"text":"The rating is for absolutely everything and it's my first long one -- which I hate

Ordered a white pizza with bunch of topings, wings and two cups of baked minestrone soup and one slice of pepperoni pizza.

Please do not bother with the pizza. It was probably the worst I've ever had. I'm from NY, this is not NY pizza. It was too salty, super soggy and too thick. 

Wings came cold

Mild sauce was absolutely nothing but vinegar. It was inedible. I think they make it in house so this must have been a bad batch. 

Single slice of pepperoni was pretty decent and crispy. 

Baked minestrone (with baked mozzarella cheese) was a bland soup with pieces of curdled cheese at the bottom of cup. Was not hot or warm. 

WORST customer service. Called to express disappointment with soup (anticipated that cheesy goodness) and the girl on the phone could not possibly have less \"I don't give a F\" in her tone.  \"Said OK thanks now we know. I don't know that cheese goes to the bottom of cup for deliver because\", and get this, \"no one has EVER ordered soup for delivery and we have no way of knowing\". I guess they do not bother to check the food before they send it out and it's impossible for them to lift a lid and make sure the food made matches menu description. 

Also please note that when you order \"kalamata olives\" you will get canned black olives. I don't think they know the difference between the two. 

I am across the street from them. We waited well over an hour for a delivery. Probably closer to an hour and a half--I will check the times. 

I am so angry that I spent $58 on this awful awful experience. I will definitely not EVER make that mistake again. What a waste of my money. I've also expressed my feelings to their corporate office and do you think anyone so much as sent me an automated \"thank you response\"? No."}
{"text":"Went went here tonight after we had walked in to another place and couldn't get a seat. It had been a while since I had eaten at a Streets of New York so I had forgotten about them. The food was pretty good. I love that they give you garlic bread to start. Most places are cheap now and make you order bread to start. We ordered the New York Combo pizza, Still number #1 toasted sandwich, kids Mac and cheese and kids spaghetti. 

Everything was pretty good. The bread on the sandwich was excellent. The pizza crust was nice and crispy and it had great flavor. Not the best pizza in the world but you can do worse. The Mac and cheese was decent. I didn't try the spaghetti but my 2 year old liked it. Overall, the food was good.

I gave them 3 stars due to the customer service. There were only 2 servers in the place which isn't out of bounds bc it is relatively small. There isn't a hostess you you just have to wait there until a server comes and gets you. The server was decently attentive until the end of the meal where we had to wait over 10 mins for the check when it was really clear that we were done. Half of our party was already waiting in the car. Deserves more stars because of the food but can't because of the service."}
{"text":"Awesome food.  Awesome delivery.  Great service and delivery guy is fast and friendly"}
{"text":"Can't get beyond horrific customer service. We were directed to by the girl at the front counter to sit at \"any table\". We were NEVER acknowledged again in the 10 minutes we just sat there, looking around for a server. We  got up and left after around 10 minutes. And still no one acknowledged us. This was on a Sunday with an empty restaurant. We've owned restaurants, this is unacceptable in this industry. Disgraceful. The manager who allowed this should be fired."}
{"text":"I was happy to see they added chicken to the menu sorry to say it was tasteless and undercooked. The cole slaw was bad and potatoe wedges hard. We won't be back"}
{"text":"Was happy to see they added broasted chicken to the menu,"}
{"text":"The food is good since I am a major pizza fan.  However, the service is not really consistent."}
{"text":"Streets of New York has declined in quality. I use to frequent this place a lot. Our recent order on Sunday, July 16, 2017 was a huge disappointment. I can't pin point one thing. Our appetizer was awful. We had the spinach artichoke dip and I'm not sure what was wrong with it but it just did not have a good taste at all. It may have been missing cream cheese. The wings were ok. I had the lasagna and a salad. The salad had water in the bottom of the container so I tossed it. The lasagna just wasn't flavorful. So I passed it off to my husband. My girls had the pizza and no complaints from them. $70 out the window. Maybe ownership has changed."}
{"text":"We have discovered the best pizza place in town.
Ginger and Mark are excellent operators, and run the restaurant well.  Their constant presence is reassuring, even though the staff is very friendly and competent in their absence.  We have been loyal customers for three years, and will continue to enjoy their delicious pizza,  and diversified menu of other Italian dishes.

They offer rapid delivery,  never sacrificing quality. 
Each and every time we order in or delivered, the dishes are prepared as homemade. The all beef meatballs are a real find, as other places only offer
Pork and beef meatballs. As locals here in Tramonto, 
we cannot find a nicer restaurant, with the owners
who are committed to quality and customer satisfaction. 
Thank you Mark and Ginger!

Mike and Jan Larsen"}
{"text":"This is such a shame that I'm writing this review as our household have been loyal customers for over the last year. I'm ill so we order a lot of delivery so I can't speak for the service in the restaurant but if you order a \"create your own topping\" selection or change one or two items on one of their favorites pizzas you will absolutely get an incorrect food order. I have a copy of the receipt that says \"no sausage\" as I can't tolerate it. Pizza came with the ricotta I did ask for as a substitute LOADED with sausage. I'm writing this as this is not the 1st, 2nd, or even 3rd time we've gotten something other than we ordered. We love their chicken, sandwiches, and the pizza sauce and crust but whoever is assembling the pizzas has an issue with customers and it reveals itself in the form of consistently incorrect orders. I've worked for years in food service and I am willing to give a place an occasional pass if they are understaffed, really busy, etc but this has happened the last several times we ordered food for delivery. Sorry Streets-we will be using Rosati's from now on. With regrets-Natalie and Marc Johnson"}
{"text":"Love the pizza, pasta, and salads. Casual place with a laid back atmosphere. The staff was attentive and took great care of us and our taste buds. We will be back."}
{"text":"We came in for lunch today; what a great place! Very cute ambience, clean and well lit.  Our server, Denise, was super outgoing, attentive and a genuinely warm person who really seemed to enjoy her job and people.

We had pizza and salad; the pizza was hot, the ingredients were fresh and plentiful, and Denise kept assuring our soft drinks were refilled. The salad was fresh, too.

We've lived here for years, but don't frequent this shopping center often so didn't think to try this location of Streets until now, but we'll definitely be back now that we've tried it! :)"}
{"text":"This location could use a visit from Chef Gordon! After being seated outdoors, I ordered 4 things: Wings, Garlic Cheese Bread, Fries, and a Diamond Back Triple Pizza. After 15 minutes, the pizza comes out, which immediately ruined the idea and purpose of an APPETIZER... I was on my second piece of pizza when the fries and garlic bread arrived. By the time the wings arrived, we weren't really even hungry anymore. We still tipped the waitress $10 and wrote it off on the idea that everything won't always be perfect in life. 

This is where you earned less than one star SoNY.. That night, we are Black Friday shopping for a big ticket item and we realize they charged us the $40.54 for our meal and also authorized our card for another $112.00...which made the difference of getting the TV at the price I wanted and have waited months to purchase. 

When I called the manager the next day, he assured me that it was just a mistake and the money would go back on my account after the bank released the authorization. DUDE, THAT WAS $112 of MY MONEY that you prevented me from accessing when I needed it. Furthermore, when I told him of my experience dining at his establishment his only comment about a pizza coming out 20 minutes before my wings was, \"Well, that's weird..\" 

No, what's weird is that you would allow someone to have an experience in your establishment that GUARANTEES they won't return and all you can say is \"That's weird\" Streets of New York is not worth the hassle for mediocre food and poor service. AVOID THIS PLACE is you value your hard-earned money."}
{"text":"Noticed no one has reviewed in a while...it you had a bad experience, you should go back. My friends and I had just arrived in Scottsdale and were HUNGRY for something near our condo. This place fit the bill. The sandwich was yummy, the fries hot and crisp, and the margharita pizza delicious (altho they DID forget to add our jalapenos).
The BEST THING, tho, was the waitress, Denise! What an absolute doll! She gave us all kind of tips about where to go and what to do during our girls weekend. Thank you, Denise, for taking us \"off the beaten\" tourist track! 
This was a great way to start a fantastic weekend."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight. The place was packed. There were 3 servers and they didn't seem to know what they were doing. We were ignored the first 15 minutes. Our server gave us a plate off a table behind us that people had been sitting at waiting for a Togo order. The dirty cups from them were still on the table. My pizza had a long hair in it. One of the servers was explaining to another table it's actually gotten better the last few weeks since there is a new manager. Rather than putting our leftover pizza in a pizza box, the server stacked 6 pieces on top of each other in a large clamshell. I feel like it was a total waste of money tonight!"}
{"text":"I give 1 star for the staffs services. As for the manager, I would sue him if possible. I bout a new york pizza along with an order of salad on Monday night (14Mar16). I went home sorting out the salads for my mom to take to work the next morning for lunch, as I sorted it out I'm very surprised to find something I didn't order in my salad, that is a HUGE BUNDLES OF HAIRS!!! I'm not joking when I said a huge bundles, because indeed it is fkn huge. I immediately called up the restaurant before they close to file a complaint, the staff took note and told me she'll contact the manager. I didn't get a called back until midday of the flowing day. At first the manager sounded nice and all, yet when it come times to compensate for the disgusting experience from his restaurant, he throw and whole $20 in my face as if its a nice jackpot. Imagine for yourself what a whole $20 will do for you if you happen to eat the foods that is that disgusting? I don't know, if the restaurant treats their customers like hungry homeless then throwing a $20usd (btw, my order that night was over $50) in their face would be sufficient in their way of handling business. To be honest, I found a strand of hair in my salad before, but never a bundles of hairs. I would love to contact the department of food safety to come and inspect how the restaurant handle its foods for the customer. This is the first review I ever made to any restaurant. I advise customers to be very careful eating there because you will never know what extra ingredients you will find in your order."}
{"text":"Today I called the Northern and 101 location, I asked what the special was? The girl told me buy one pizza get one free. Great I say, any size? Sure...so I order a medium 4 cheese with pepperoni and the other one with bacon. When I get there to pick it up she tells me \"$34.00 please\" and I'm surprised...\"one medium formaggi pizza w/pepperoni is 34.00?\" \"Well no it's a specialty pizza and I can only give you a free medium cheese pizza.\" so I call and speak the manager \"Carlos\" who barely understood English and tell him that I'm up set that on the phone she tells me it's buy one get one and when I get there it's something else. He says I saved you 7.00 that's a lot of money because the regular price is 13.?? so I say if that's the case then why did I pay 34 dollars? It should have been 26. dollars minus 7 dollars...he puts me on hold, comes back and says I can give you 2.00 back. I don't want 2.00 back I want to you tell the girl not to say buy one get one free if that's not the case and explain to me why I paid 34.00 for 2 medium pizzas. He says, you don't want the 2.00? I'm sorry that's all I can do. I told him it was clear to me that he was not the manager and no instead of an unhappy customer he has an unhappy and insulted customer and I would find out who was above him and take it up with them."}
{"text":"I went here with my daughter on Saturday night...Great pizza...great service...(35th ave)the 12th st location not so hot...the staff who made it over cooked it 2x...burnt...thin crust pizza looked like dried jerky on a cracker...but the pizza sauce this chain uses is AMAZING ...fresh toppings."}
{"text":"This location stinks period.Thin crust was burnt....overcooked what we paid for was \"Streets of NewYork\" quality pizza what we got was dried jerky on a burnt cracker....Terrible....I noticed the people working in the back ....did not look like they would know a thing about ITALIAN food...much less NewYork Pizza! Paid $27.00 for a large 3 topping. This was not the first time it happened either...pizza lately has been overcooked with 2inches of CRUST! They will not reimburse either. We stopped going to this location all together. Only gave a second star because \"The Streets\" sauce is excellent.Please change your kitchen staff!!!"}
{"text":"Well, the only good item was the breadsticks that came with the \"Four Peaks Beer 'Cheese.'\" I put quotes around that because if you look at the picture I posted, it's more like a water. Why would they would call it \"cheese\" I have no idea. It was like a soupy, soupy biege tinted water. Yikes! 

Next, look at the Pesto Mozzarella Crostini, yikes again! I didn't even try to taste it...it was a hot mess I truly was afraid of.  

The next item, the Boneless Wings with Honey Hot...were not. The sauce was more about amount of spice, not taste.  

Finally, the Calzone...didn't even try it.  Ordered Green Olives with it; they did not add them (but made sure they charged me for them).  If I wanted cheese bread, I would have ordered it.  

Pass on them...was lookingforward to a good Calzone but alas...got breadsticks instead. 

Wish I had ordered in, then I could have given them their food back. I gave them a 2 star for the breadsticks; not much else to recommend."}
{"text":"I have a gluten intolerance and found this place on findmeglutenfree.com.  They have gluten-free items marked on the menu which makes ordering much easier for people like me. I shared a GF pizza and wings with my boyfriend which we both enjoyed.  He had the free garlic knots which he said were just OK."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now, and this last visit was the most memorable for multiple reasons. I went with a friend and it was a holiday, but the place appeared to have only one server and a dining area that was at least half full the entire time we were present. 
When you walk in it says to seat yourself, so my friend and I wandered back to the usual booth. Someone came in right after us, but was greeted and served prior to us. The server was pleasant, but you could tell when she got busy because her responses changed for when she brought the checks. 
My friend and I both ordered the lunch special antipasto salad and an iced tea. The food looked great, but I was not happy about the quality of some of the ingredients. I will be back again, and I know things will be better."}
{"text":"I like this place for lunch, especially to walk away from work for a bit.
It's quiet and the waitress is sexy ..."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. 3 employees working in the front service area. One customer paying for order and one customer in a booth. We were never even acknowledged when we entered. Waited 10 minutes to place order. Decided to call in order while sitting at the front counter as we couldnt get anyones attention. Lady answered phone placed me on hold to check on my order that i hadnt even placed. Very unorganized. We decided to go to Barro's in Anthem for quick friendly service."}
{"text":"I have ordered twice from this place- sandwich (Italian), pizza (specialty), and a few sides. Food always takes too long to arrive if you get delivery. If they quote you 30 minutes, you will be waiting an hour.

Pizza is average and greasy, but not bad with fresh ingredients.
Sandwich tasted good but was a bit too salty."}
{"text":"One Star because zero isn't an option.
The crummy attitude began when I placed my (call in) order with Travis (receipt listed him as General Manager). Placing my pick up order was an exercise in futility. I was spoken to with short, abrupt, snarky responses.  I ordered a large pepperoni pizza. I was snidely informed pizzas are sold in 10\" 16\" & 18\".  Any GED graduate could figure that math out. What's the largest number____?
Attitude continued when I arrived. \"Just give me a name.\" 
The whole experience was extremely contrite, unexpected and disappointing. I felt like I was in the Twilight Zone episode: Please never come back to my restaurant. 
Needless to say I won't be returning. 
My final interaction with Travis was a brief Cliff's Notes version of customer service 101. I told Travis that I was interpreting his shortness as rude and a simple apology would retain a customer; e.g. Sorry I didn't mean to sound short, rude, or snarky, I'm swamped tonight. Instead the response I received was \"I'm not apologizing\". 
I finished my \"small\" (because apparently beer is sold in small and large sizes) draft beer, left my pie on the counter and left."}
{"text":"We had a coupon for a BOGO free pasta entree so hubby and I came here for dinner. Service was good and the food was delicious! Hubby had the Baked Ziti and it was plump full of sausage and loaded with cheese. I had the Toscana with penne pasta and couldn't be happier. The portions were huge and we both took our other half's home. I do wish they would have come with a slice of garlic bread however to mop up some of the flavorful sauce."}
{"text":"We did a to go order from this streets of New York this afternoon. We got 2 Number ones and a Gorgonzola pear salad. We made a few requests on each order and they were made perfectly to our request. The salad is one of my favorites and I get it every time I go there. The sandwich bread is always the best! They even put the sandwich dressing on the side so it wouldn't get soggy on our drive home.   We also love that we can get cash back through Yelp at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was amazing service was great I'll definitely be going back. The hostess was super friendly"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.   I have never had anything to complain about.  RJ is incredible and when my food is getting made by Manny it's always on point!   The rest of the staff is just as good!!  Great place for amazing food and ice cold beer!!!"}
{"text":"friendly staff nice place.  however the pizza didn't have enough cheese on it. halfway up thru the slices it was just bread. kind of disappointed"}
{"text":"We were in fountain hills staying at the We Ko Pa resort for the weekend. We decided to go on the hunt for some food outside of the casino and this was the closest we could find. Neither of us had ever had streets of new york before so we gave it a shot. Now, the food was good, but the service is really what stood out to us. We walked in a little before 9pm which I guess is right around the time the whole town of fountain hills shuts down. We were greeted and we placed an order to go. The lady we were helped by was one of the best servers I've ever had. She asked if we needed anything and even went on hunt for some paper plates for us since we were staying at the hotel and wouldn't have any. She went above and beyond and was more helpful than she probably had to be. Friendly, and genuine. We got back to the hotel and realized we had more food than we originally expected and figured that was all her doing... or maybe it's because it was closing time. Either way, we were shocked. I wish I would of grabbed her name but honestly I think she probably stands out there anyways as being one of the best. We probably won't make it back to fountain hills anytime soon but if we do, this will be on our stops."}
{"text":"Awesome! I have had the pizza delivered but I wanted some pasta so I ordered the lasagna. It came with a salad and cheesy garlic bread for a little extra. It arrived early and it was delicious. The employees were very nice as well. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Come here for lunch a lot. Cheap lunch menu with  delicious food. Everything I've had is great but really love the wings and the spaghetti and meatball calzone is amazing. Service has always been top notch,"}
{"text":"My friend and I were attracted to this place for two reasons: I love pizza. She can only eat gluten-free pizza. We were a perfect match made for the Streets of New York! ^_^* 

We shared a walnut pear salad and a 10\" gluten-free pepperoni and jalepeno pizza, and both were super delicious! My friend commented that gluten-free pizza crust usually tastes bland, but it was very tasty here! We ordered an interesting contrast of items, but the whole meal was very good. Our waitress was very attentive and kind, which made the experience even better. :) So, stop by!"}
{"text":"Just got robbed!! The pizza here is good but I just ordered a pizza and they racked up my bill to $27.11 I got a pizza and coke!!!!! That's it! I called and they nicely told me that the sauce replacement because my girlfriend is allergic is $2.75! Then additional for some burnt chicken on there. I promised myself I'll never pay $27 for a simple pizza and coke again! It's ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Don't use their on line orders, for starters. My son ordered us pizza one night a few weeks ago and when he went in they insisted it had not yet been paid for. He paid for it again despite protesting ( I guess figuring they would see the double order eventually and fix it. Several hours later they called him to ask if he was going to pick up the pizza he ordered. He talked to a manager who said the double charge would be credited to his account. I called a few days later because his card had still not been credited. Again, they stated it would be credited and the delay was \"due to the weekend\".  It never was credited!
 My son was the one who liked their food (taking into account it's close to home). I find it bland and some of the worst pizza, spaghetti, and other dishes I've had. 
 I've had a poor opinion of the staff in past visits. It seems to consist of a bunch of clueless teenagers who are more interested in tending to their boyfriends and girlfriends, who stop in, than the customers. There's always one employee fidgeting with the register or orders who seems confused about how to do the job. One time I remember having to wait forever for an order only to find out they forgot to put it in. 
My son, who used to do business with them several times a week says he is never buying from them again after this. I'm fine with that. I prefer, Rays, Papa Murphys, Humble Pie (my favorite), Mellow Mushroom or any of the chain pizza places around here. It will be an easy change to not eat this food. 
Yea, we could keep calling them until they fix it but I guess he is considering it a $20 lesson. Guess they lost a fair amount of business over $20 worth of bad service, eh?"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place out as I'm in town for business and it was close to my hotel.  Portions were large but not tasty, like a purchase at Costco that you regret for months.  I was intrigued by the cozy bar set up in the corner, but became increasingly dismayed when the wait staff decided to close out adjacent to my Chicken Parm and discuss impending pregnancies and divorces.   I also learned that Todd needs to remember to clock in for the lunch shift in order to get paid.  Unfortunately I'll probably be back since I'll be in the area for a few months."}
{"text":"Friendly attentive service & management clean restaurant nothing less than advertised. This is a good neighborhood eatery. Recommended when you're looking for something simple and good."}
{"text":"Hi, thanks for your response! We paid 27.98 for a two topping pizza. While, it was great pizza, it's still very pricey. See photo. Were we overcharged? That's nine dollars plus for our three family members for just pizza."}
{"text":"Much better than I remember it being 15 years ago when I worked right next to the Scottsdale location.  I wish it was a little cheaper as a large pizza can be kind of pricey, but it was very good NY style pizza.  The street fries are pretty impressive."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever! We used to come to this location all the time but recently our experience has gone from bad to worse! Third time in a 2 month period that our service, or lack there of, was bad! We are a family of 5 who came in on a Thursday after 6, not greeted and according to the sign, we sat ourselves.  There was ample staff at the front register, doing what? I have no idea. After waiting nearly 10 min without even an acknowledgement, we got our menus and were told by the waiter he would be back only to go to the table beside us, who I need to add were seated well after we had been sitting and waiting for someone. He proceeded to get their drink order, brought back their drinks and began taking their food order! This was our third and final time to this establishment...!!! If you are busy it is understandable to wait but customers need to be acknowledged, waited on as a first come first serve basis, and overall made to feel welcome! Very sad!"}
{"text":"This is a very close place to my house and is one of the reasons I frequent it so much.

The Pizza is good but nothing that is going to blow your underwear off. I love the anti pasta salad for a starter and the cheese bread. I also order the meatball sides..pretty good.

Peroni on tap and some Stone Brews in the fridge is also a good time ;)"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my wife. Tony was the GM and served us. Service was over the top and my meatball sub with garlic parm fries were amazing. My wife had a half soup half sandwich. Tomato bisque soup was heavenly. Will be returning!"}
{"text":"Horrible food, mediocre service, sad face.  Wanted a good Italian place I could walk to but nothing special or authentic about it.   Slow service too."}
{"text":"We ordered the honey hot wings and a 4 topping pizza (pepperoni, sausage, bacon, mozzarella, and provolone). The pizza was AMAZING; wings were pretty good. I would totally order pizza from this place again in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"Super bummed. I just moved to this area and wanted to try out other than pizza items and boy it was a mistake. Threw all my food away. I ordered French fries and boneless wings on a Monday night. Takes a full hour and food is barley warm. They don't bring any ranch with my wings even though I specifically asked for it. Wings are soggy that all breading falls off when you try to pick it up. The fries are worse, also super soggy and oily. I can wrap the fries around my finger without it breaking and I soaked up multiple napkins with oil from the fries.

Threw all of it in the trash and ate frozen corn dogs."}
{"text":"Completely done with this place and the \"PR guy's\" fake promises he posts on here in response to the negative reviews.  Either I get the free credit for another visit, or I NEVER go again.  Shoddy and slow service and horribly over priced food."}
{"text":"poor customer service, very very poor! they dont give you itemized receipt which was weird. \"We did close your ticket and we cannot print it out once its close?!? WOW!  thats what the guy at the register said! Well why did you close my ticket before i pay for it? Unacceptable! Would not do business with them because of that. 21st century you should know what you pay for! Thanks but not thanks!!!"}
{"text":"Let me tell you something about this little gem off Fort Apache and Trop. It's one of about 10 restaurants in a strip mall, very nice inside except for one thing: There was not one single person inside eating. Don't let this place go unnoticed! I don't give out many 5 stars, let alone for pizza, but their pies are fantastic.

3 types of crust to choose from, traditional New York hand tossed, a thin crust and a hybrid crust they call hand tossed thin, kind of a mix of the other two. Sauce is boss, and it was quite tasty, good cheese, not overly greasy and an abundance of topping choices.

The wings were also fantastic. We got the 'medium' heat level and and they were seasoned differently than the the typical buffalo (which really isn't my favorite anyway), not sure how to describe it but they were damn good.

The true test was bringing the pies home and seeing what everyone else thought...all 6 of us thought it was some of the best pizza around."}
{"text":"I had been here before and was really excited to go back for the pizza. I ordered the same thing we did before and it was just as good, however, our silverware was dirty which was a bit of a turn-off.  Needless to say, the food is not what we were upset about. As my husband and I sat at our table finishing up our beverages we saw a server bust out of the kitchen. It was strange but what caught our attention was the manager who was following her and being a bit loud which resulted in causing a scene. The server appeared very upset and the manager did not seem to handle the situation in a professional manner. Being a server myself in the past, and having a daughter in the industry that is not a manager I would want to work under and therefore will not be supporting this restaurant anymore."}
{"text":"I'm hosting mother's day for my mom and set up a whole patio table for us to  eat outside  at sunset. I ordered our food at 5:43pm it is now 7:58 and still have not received our dinner. They have called us twice now stating it's on it's way and offered us 15% off and then upped it to 50%. I am very disappointed as it is dark out and will no longer be able to celebrate outside on our patio. Also the menu online states they have eggplant but they do not know anything about that and do no carry eggplant."}
{"text":"Luv luv this place! Amazing pizza!  Great service too!   Happy hour is great too!  You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We used to love coming here but their prices are way too high. They just keep creeping up and we were willing to put up with that occasionally because their pizza was so good. Well now they've gone and changed the amazing sauce for the pizza and the bread. Also the bread isn't the same either. So long."}
{"text":"This place has an amazing environment. I saw regulars come in and greet the individuals all around. I sat down and service was immediate! My girl order the cheese ravioli and was very pleased while I ordered the meatball sub on wheat. Both orderers were perfect I always ordered from them and writing this review because I am eagerly awaiting the opening today!"}

{"text":"Best pizza and boneless wings I've had in a long time. I did a to go order using the Yelp app and it was super easy. It appeared the place was pretty popular. I look forward to ordering again or going in to have a meal. Keep up the great service. Oh...when I went to pickup, it wasn't quite ready and they provided a nice big cup of ice water during the wait and then walked my order out to me. Good service!!"}

Price - Affordable and sizable portions 

Ambience -  Feel good place!"}
{"text":"Have gotten pizza here before and it was very good however picked one up tonight for dinner. What in the world? It was disgusting. The grease was dripping from it and it was totally soggy. So hard to find good pizza in this area. Will NOT be going back here. Couldn't stomach it had to throw it out. Sad. Save yourselves some grief and pass on this Streets of New York."}
{"text":"Great little spot in the Target / Ross shopping plaza area. This location is kinda tucked between several other larger spots, so it can be easy to overlook, but it's worth a stop in if you enjoy Italian eats.

Headed here with a co-worker for a lunch time visit. They have a lunch specials menu that offers a little bit smaller portions for a lunch price. We both opted to make our own pasta. I had the spaghetti with meat sauce. Bread was brought out in a basket to snack on while we waited for our food. It was a tasty starter.

The spaghetti came out in a smaller lunch sized bowl, but it was more than enough for a lunch time meal. The waitress checked back in on us regularly and kept the drinks filled.

Overall: A
Great lunch stop off and tasty food!"}
{"text":"Do not go!
Bad pizza not crispy crust
Wings just so so
I'm from east coast where pizza is awesome  this pizza was like out of a box terrible. 

Trust me
Don't go

SLOW service to boot"}
{"text":"I guarantee this is the worst Pizza you could ever get go to the supermarket buy a box of frozen pizza undercook it and there you have it the same taste you will get at this restaurant terrible disgraceful this should never be called the streets of New York because New York's Pizza tastes nothing like this it is enormously much better in New York.

Don't waste your money eating here"}
{"text":"Showed up at 7:30 on a Thursday (9/18/13) sat at the bar, bar was empty. Had a beer, ordered two slices, halfway through second beer and halfway through the second slice, short blonde server with glasses hands me the bill and says I'll take this when your ready. I instantly felt like I was at Denny or IHOP! Football is on, two of us at the bar, and apparently nobody trained her very well. manager was nice, but all of the employees acted like it was a McDonalds crew. Not real professional and was a bit irritating as they were all hanging around the bar talking smack.
Food was good. Beer was cold. Bar was clean and there was volume on the game so I was happy about that. I just think they need a bit more training on customer service and welcome new customers by telling tem about the place or the food or something."}
{"text":"I come to phoenix for business every three months and I have to say that I really do look forward to eating here. Sometimes i may order out or dine in, but the result is always the same. Pure taste-bud satisfaction."}
{"text":"Good pizza but expensive. And your side salad is pretty much a no for me. Worst salad I've ever had and there was so much of it...for a side salad????? For real? When I asked for a to go box, I went to put it in the box because my boyfriend said he would eat it later, and nothing but green water from all the salad and whatever peppers they had in it, came out....pretty much made me never want salad again. Pizza is very good...good job on the pizza. But I've had better salad at McDonalds. I'd order more from you guys, but it's pricy. I'm broke enough trying to survive in life."}
{"text":"Dropped in for a lunch one day and decided to order a #1 Sandwich (Ham, Salami, Provolone, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Onions, Dressing) w/Pasta Salad and a Coors Light.

Since I was dining alone, I sat at the counter.  The food was prepared pretty fast.  I only had a few sips of my Beer before the waitress came out with the Sandwich.  I took one bite and instantly became a fan.  The Bread is soft and crunchy....the crunch comes from the toaster.  The Sandwich is served hot from a toaster....which makes the flavor of the Meats come out.  The only complaint I have about the Sandwich is that the Dressing makes the Bread too soggy....if you don't eat it fast, it will fall apart on you.

The Pasta Salad is OK....too much Cheese and Dressing on it...I would have preferred it with a little less.

Overall, it was a nice lunch experience.

Return Factor - 84%"}
{"text":"2 stars because the pizza is good but the delivery service was terrible.

I searched my address on the online delivery zone calculator and this location showed up as within delivery range for my house. Just to be sure, because it seemed kind of far from me, I called for delivery and asked if my house was in range for delivery. I was told that they would have to check, and when they took me off hold they said they checked and my house was on the border of their range so they could deliver. So of course I ordered my pizza.

30 minutes into a 45 minute wait time, a different person called me saying that I was out of range and they had canceled my order. When I told them that I had made sure to ask and had been told they could deliver to me, she explained how a delivery range works (which was not my question) and said that they would not cross the highway, even though my house was in range. She was rude, condescending, defensive, and unapologetic, which is remarkable for a food service business who just messed up and shouldn't want to lose business. When you mess up a customer's order and they don't get their food you don't get to be defensive or unapologetic.

This place has good pizza but I'm taking my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service, charming ambiance.  All reasons to frequent this place as often as possible.   A full menu with a wide variety of pizza pasta and subs.  

I took my family of 6 and we literally stuffed ourselves with an 18\" pineapple pizza, 10\" Mediterranean pizza, 10\" meatball pizza, chicken parmigiana and pasta, cheesy breadsticks and drinks.  We then added an 18\" pepperoni and sausage pizza to go with two extra cheese slices and our bill was $100.  Not bad for an oversized dinner and lunch the next day.   

Highly recommended by the Anderson family 

Thank you!"}
{"text":"The best Artichoke Spinach dip I've had!!! The honey boneless wings was my second best. The customer service and environment was warm and inviting. After shopping all afternoon this was the perfect break."}
{"text":"We believe streets of New York has great pizza and some of the best  baked hot wings We've ever devoured.. 
  Great food ... Good value and award winning service..  We dine here or at one of their other locations frequently . Definitely worth trying out ..  ; ) .."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming to this location every Saturday night for over 2 years for the bogo subs. We have had few issues and have actually became friend with most of the servers.  Angela,  Breanne, Rj and when Zach worked there.  They have always taken great care of us. With the exception of one waitress (not sure of her name the movie ratatouille comes to mind though)  The kitchen makes mistakes sometimes but our server always corrects it for us.  But the manager good lord he is terrible! Poor customer service skills to say the least to worried about saving that dollar. In the last 2-2 1/2 years we have been coming here he has never acknowledged us. Never thanked us for coming in or even just just said hello.  We love our servers though and they always take great care of us so we will be back!!!"}
{"text":"My family & I used to eat here frequently; food and service were great but both have gone downhill over the past year+. Servers act like it's a pain to serve you. Seems more like a family-owned/dining place and I feel like I'm interrupting their dinner! The prices have gone up tremendously. Don't try to get a small order of wings... (now they only serve large orders and they're expensive!) Won't eat here anymore. Too bad since we used to really like this place. There are too many other places that make an effort for a good product and great service."}
{"text":"Street of New York... food is unoriginal but tasty and traditionally comforting. The normal; pizza, pasta, salads and generic pizzeria appetizers. Great selection of drafts beers and reasonably priced glasses of wine. 

I would continue eating at the restaurant, although I would never actually dine inside at this location again. It is absolutely impossible to receive and simple smile or a thank you from ANY of the staff. Overall the service is mediocre and extremely un-friendly. You will have a better chance of receiving better service from the giant rat at Chuck E Cheese's."}
{"text":"As a NYker, pizza is so far the most satisfying for my \"authentic\" crave. Still not a winner, but my go to place. Dough and crust has somewhat of a 'singas' taste, but nothing like the Lombardi or (original) Grimaldis taste. I didn't go to any of the LV Grimaldi location, because the BK one will always be the high-standard I want to remember.

Service is great and we also often order take out. Make sure to grab menus when on store, the coupons deals are good, but you must surrender them. So average 20-30mins wait for a fresh pie. Had the NY steak sandwich, the mushrooms and gravy are tasty. Their wings are good too."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times and never had bad food. Great pizza, great broasted chicken and potatoes.

I get food or sit down and eat here twice a month, and recommend the place to everybody."}
{"text":"First of all, I understand that this is a pizza place and not a salad place but I used to live near a \"Streets\" and the salads at that location were good. I am VERY disappointed in the chicken Caesar I just got from this place. I just paid $13 for a restaurant chicken caesar and what I got was a garden salad with cold prepackaged chicken on it. The chicken wasn't even cooked fresh. This salad was not even fast food worthy. I wouldn't be so upset if I hadn't paid So much. The salad bar at Barro's is 100 times better and half the price. Only reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because the staff was very courteous and friendly."}
{"text":"I ordered online, and couldn't find the area to put my coupon. So I put it in the notes and thought I would just call and made sure they could redeem it. The guy who answered, AJ was his name, told me it was already processed and he couldn't redeem my coupon. I was okay with that but his customer service was terrible, he was completely rude to me and his tone of voice was very rude as well. I proceeded to ask if he could throw some extra ranches in there for my pizza and he rudely said no, they're 50 cents and you're supposed to do that online, even though I just bought a $25 pizza. I just ended up cancelling my entire order because he was one of the rudest people I have ever talked to. Even though this was my favorite pizza place, I will never go back to this location again. He was even rude when I cancelled my order and I felt like he was almost mocking me by repeating \"yes I can cancel  your order\" and started laughing."}
{"text":"First time trying this restaurant. It's pretty bad, expensive and the dishes taste like plastic. A last resort only, well, maybe you're better off with convenience store snacks instead. Salads are garnished with all types of peppers NOT mentioned on the menu. Caesar is laughable. Mixed lettuce with peppers, assorted veggies and a few Parmesan shavings do not a Caesar make. Design your own pasta was warmed up pasta with a bland sauce. Crispy crust on the pizza was anything but. Dessert cake was pre-manufactured and tasted full of chemicals, making me wonder exactly how long it had been in their fridge. Very disappointing, as was the 87 dollar bill before tip for lunch for three people."}
{"text":"after a takeout order that had me waiting in their lobby for almost 30 minutes after the pick up time i only do delivery now, mainly because this is one of the few places that delivers to my 'hood. twice, the delivery driver has claimed my house doesn't exist at my address. say what? i know it exists because i live here. a quick review of the directions caused my pizza to appear, cold, at my door. the qualify is good, but inconsistent. often we end up baking the pizza in our oven on 170 degrees for awhile after it arrives  side note: if you keep it in the box, this is a great way to keep any pizza warm without burning if you aren't going to eat it right away.

a word to the wise: the wings here are weird. not like the wings at most places. g and i don't like them because they aren't saucy ... it is like the sauce is baked into them or something - we're used to places that toss the wings in the sauce. still, this is a fine option for delivery, given the number of places that will venture to my house. that is, if they can find it."}
{"text":"So I ordered a very large order about a month ago which was completely screwed up. I called and talked to the manager who promised to make up for it. So I ordered last night and talked with Alexis who was very kind and professional. Done took my order down accurately and repeated it back. About 5 min later Mike the GM called me back to dig further into what happened. I explained the situation and he was very professional and sincere and got my order ready for me AND had my order delivered. With Alexis and Mike my order showed up 100% accurate and 100% delicious! My family and I were VERY happy! Thank you to the 2 kind, sincere and professional hospitality professionals that helped me!!"}
{"text":"Great boaster chicken  servers are attentive.   
 The clean restaurant is always cleaned."}
{"text":"Ordered the NY combo 18'' Pizza. Generous portions and slices are big. Good quality sausage and the red sauce and crust are very tasty. I would order again,"}
{"text":"I had a \"giant\" New York combo slice.  The food tasted great, however was not as large as the name implied. I did not mind the price so much, but had it not implied a larger size I would have ordered more. I am not a big eater, but I recommended two slices if you there too eat lunch.

The service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Love this location and it's worth the drive. There is a location closer to my house, but I choose to drive to this one. The antipasto salad is the best there and the pizza is always perfect! The staff is always welcoming and friendly, great customer service. The food always comes out just the way we order, have never had a bad experience. Highly recommend this location and its staff."}
{"text":"It took almost 2 hours to get a pizza and wings delivered. When we got the pizza it was cold and disappointing. They also forgot our beverage. Paid $50 for a very disappointing dinner."}
{"text":"Came in to make an order to go and didn't have to wait too long. The girl at the counter was very nice and took my order right away. She offered water while we waited. The restaurant is kept very clean and they have 3 TV's showing sports. Great service and great food!"}
{"text":"Last night they took over an hour and a half to get to my house. Claiming that the address was put down wrong but they would have called closer to the estimated delivery time not 45 minutes after. Didn't offer my money back. Pizza was awful."}
{"text":"Always great food. 
Always great service. 
The beer and pizza are great in the restaurant, and every delivery has exceeded expectations. 

You can't go wrong with this outfit."}
{"text":"This was the best pizza I've had in a long time! Always will be coming here for it!! I ordered a side of pasta as well well Alfredo and the garlic chicken and I wasn't very pleased with it, but barb had no hesitation to help me be satisfied with my meal! I mean she's the most sweetest owner I've ever met!!! She even offered a free dessert!!! As well as a free delivery slip for when I order in! I mean I was so pleased! I'll definitely always come back! The pizza is just so delicious"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I found this place on a whim. The young guy who sat us threw us off guard because he was just wearing a jogging suit and spoke to us and took our order with both his hands in his pocket. Eventually another server took over and he was great! He made sure our drinks were refilled and was very outgoing. We ordered the Four Peaks Beer Cheese as an appetizer. We were surprised with how good it was! We had to stop ourselves from eating it all right away in order to still have room for the pizza. For our pizza we got the G'No It's Good. Let me just say that I'm not a fan of olives but I ate all the olives on my slices! It was so good! The place is very clean and family friendly. I would recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite restaurant!! 
The owner is amazing and she is so friendly. Everyone feels at home. I love to come and watch the Golden Knights games in a fun, local spot with great food. I love the spinach dip!!!! It is by far the best I have had. Pizza is delicious too. If you are looking for a family friendly spot, this is it! You will be hooked!!"}
{"text":"So we have ordered and came here for lunch and it was amazing just amazing pizza by the slice can't go wrong.  We came here last Sunday night for dinner. We were ready for pizza or a calzone since NYPD isn't open at this time. 
I guess they give u \"garlic strips\" aka pizza dough with zero flavor. We ordered a pepperoni pizza reg crust and them a small \"supreme\" thin crust. The pizza was OK. This issue with dinner is the calzone we ordered we did a make your own we just did cheese pepperoni and sausage.. and it came out it as sooooo soggy and there was marinara in it. Gross!!!! Usually marinara sauce is in a cup to dip it calzone in not in it. Anyway the only reason why they get a 4 star is because they have very very very yummy Cannoli's! That's it!!!! so yummy that I will come back and just order those and I will be happy."}
{"text":"I eat here often because it's in my neighborhood and the food is phenomenal but the staff isn't always professional. Every time I've gone in, I'm either waiting a while to be helped or my order almost seems rushed. The restaurant doesn't give off a warm welcome at all. But the cooks keep me going back lol"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery & after it arrived over an hour later, I was disappointed as soon as I laid my eyes on it.  I ordered the Lasagna and it was unrecognizable as such. It was just a whole bunch of sauce over a few mushy noodles, I really couldn't believe they served this. We also ordered the Italian Beef Sandwich that couldn't be eaten as the bread was hard as a rock and what was inside the sandwich was a poor excuse for any sandwich.   We ended throwing away both dishes and made Mac & Cheese for dinner instead."}
{"text":"I had a coupon for a 14\" pie from United Blood Services and I stopped in to use it yesterday.  I sat at the counter.  The woman running the counter area gave me some menus and she got an iced tea for me.

I ordered a 14\" pizza with cheese and pepperoni.  While waiting, the server brought me three garlic knots.  They were hot and fresh but they could have used more garlic.  The knots were accompanied by a small container of hot marinara for dipping.

In a normal amount of time, another server brought me the pizza and kidded me when she realized I was dining solo.  Later she came back and asked me if I wanted her to box the rest to bring home.

The pizza was good.  I prefer thick crust pizza but this was a credible thin crust pizza with a small amount of tomato sauce and more cheese and pepperoni.

I was impressed by the staff.  They were very friendly and they realized from the get go that I was a first time customer.  I'd recommend them and I'll probably be back if I'm in the mood for thin pizza.  I also had a chance to peruse the menu and saw the Italian dinners they serve.  Maybe that would be something to try."}
{"text":"Just another pizza place. just about as good as NYPD but since I have started doing NY's thin crust I give them the nod.

I like the service.  Sometimes they are show but they are always friendly. sometimes they give me bread sticks on the side with marinara.  I like them.  

If I am in the area I will hit it. Not the best, but certainly not bad."}
{"text":"Pizza was terrible and it's a chain! Don't be fooled and bother everything sucks and it's all frozen and served. But wait the waitress did say they have to boil the noodles; It was an epic response to the poor food quality!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan as well - both for take-out and delivery.  It's not the BEST pizza in the world, but it's light-years ahead of the national chains.  Pizza aside, I would highly suggest trying the Napolitano Pasta - it's incredibly good!  
I agree w/ Lisa N., the salads are HUGE easy to split.  
The delivery drivers at this location are top-notch - always arriving well ahead of the estimate."}
{"text":"This place is \"Meh!\"  I've been a couple times with some friends and finally got to the point where I won't go anymore.  I can't say that the place is horrible or that the service is bad, I just personally don't like their food.

The wings I've had are just blah; not crispy and tasting too much likes Frank's Red Hot sauce.  But what really irks me is the pizza.  I prefer New York pizza and grew up back East so I've experienced a lot of good New York style pizza.  I think that always makes me angry that the place is called Streets of New York and the pizza isn't even nearly as good as some slices I'd buy at some random place in the food court of the mall back upstate.  Even if I didn't have that expectation from New York being in the name, I still wouldn't prefer this pizza to pretty much anywhere else in the valley short of Peter Piper or Little Caesars."}
{"text":"A nice local pizza/pasta place, with a bar area to catch the game.  They offer whole wheat pasta which was different.  The bread/marinara was nice for a hungry dinner group.  Service was attentive and friendly.

Its in a far corner of a strip mall so you gotta look hard for it or you'll miss it.

3 stars +1 for friendly service."}
{"text":"Everything was exactly as requested, they got here 45 minutes before the estimated arrival time! Best delivery service I've had by far!! Food was AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"My first and second delivery experiences with this business were not the best however since then they have made up tremendously for their mistakes. The wings are still the best I've ever had. They are made fresh every weekend. My favorite wings are the honey hot wings. However I still get my order late if I order through Grub Hub (WITHOUT FAIL) even though I'm only a mile or so away from the business."}
{"text":"Good food, but slow delivery. We live pretty close to Streets of NY and it's been over an hour and our food was just delivered. My husband called the manager and he said that they were short delivery drivers, which the website doesn't specify. When they're short drivers, it is an hour and 15 min delivery time compared to 45 minutes. I wish the website would specify this. Very disappointed in their service."}
{"text":"Had our usual pizza and salad split.   Service and food was great and the whole crew was on top of things!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I'm from NY and I definitely approve of their pizza! Just like back home :) Also, I tried their $7 spaghetti and meatballs deal that they have on Wednesdays, and it was delicious as well! I was pretty nervous because I usually don't like other people's pasta dishes having come from an Italian family, but this one passes the test! Great atmosphere too."}
{"text":"I received a voucher from UBS for a free 14\" cheese pizza from this restaurant. It was for dine-in only, so I kind of felt obligated to order soda and an appetizer. However, this wasn't a bad thing because the food was delicious. If this place was closer to where I live, I would probably order from here often. I took off a star because it was slightly difficult to receive napkins. As to whether this pizza is true to the New York style, I have no idea. I've never been to New York. But, this is good pizza no matter what style it is."}
{"text":"I placed an order for delivery tonight...took them well over an hour to get here. The delivery man (who I later found out was the \"manager\") forgot the 2 liter at the store. I call back and the young girl who took my order answered the phone. I let her know he forgot the soda and she said he was on his way back to the store to pick it up and he would be back. 15 mins later I called back and she then informed me he was just now leaving and would be here in 5 mins. By this point the street fries are even more cold than they were when I got them. My girlfriend goes to the store and csame back before the manager even got here with the 2 liter. He kept saying \" next time free two liter on us.\" As if there will ever be a next time. The one plus was the pizza was pretty good....after heating it up in my oven. Never again."}
{"text":"This place used to be one of the best pizza places! I haven't ate at the location in years. Now the streets of New York is the official pizza of the suns and dbacks, the pizza is very accessible when attending a ball game so I haven't had much of an urge to grab a pizza here. 
I decided the other day that it would be a pizza night so I placed my pick up order, picked it up with the friendly staff and went home. The pizza is definitely not the same. I just ordered a regular crust pepperoni pizza and I was a little disappointed that it tasted like cardboard. I even decided to microwave a slice to see if it would taste a little better. I would try this location again just because I know their pizza is good. Maybe I will try to sit in the restaurant next time."}
{"text":"Here for lunch and ordered the Broasted Chicken dark meat combo. Disappointing to say the least, the meat was cooked fine but the size of the thigh was extremely small to the point the leg actually had more meat than the thigh. The fries here used to be AMAZING..... Not so much anymore they are typical small greasy fries without the crispness they once had."}
{"text":"I stop in here from time to time with a friend who lives locally. We really enjoy their chicken cobb salad and have never ordered anything else! I have to say that the people who work here are all VERY friendly. Everyone greets you and the atmosphere is really relaxed and enjoyable. I know this is a 'chain' but this one feels like a local hangout with friendly people!"}
{"text":"It was my last evening in Phoenix on business and I just wanted to relax.  ordered a pizza for delivery and it arrived hot and it was very good.  Would recommend you try!"}
{"text":"Food isn't the problem with this location.  It's the service and management.  Food is decent enough to come back but I try to avoid as much human contact with this location as much as humanly can.  If i could do everything by machine, this is one place I would like to implement the system.  One time I was so frustrated watching servers I caught myself from getting up and serving customers.  Saddest thing about this place is that most restaurants have food ruining their reviews but this place just flat out awful place to dine or order take out.  usually takes more than 1 hour to get my pizza."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this establishment since it opened which has been many years. In fact, I dined there when it was named Mike's back in the mid-80's.  I was severely disappointed when I ordered delivery and was met by a delivery driver waving his \"Make America Great Again\" hat and asking how it felt to see it because he saw my political sticker on my car. This is no joke- he actually brought his dumb red hat to my door waving it asking this question. This was distasteful and all I wanted was dinner. Not to be met with some ignorant driver using his hat as an intimidation factor. Very uncool Streets of New York. It alarming your employees greet customers in this manner."}
{"text":"We walked in on a Friday and the place was empty with the exception of one couple. The place looked fairly clean. We were told to sit where we like. Our waiter came pretty quickly and took our order. He was nice. 
We ordered pizza and the sampler appetizer. We also needed a gluten free pizza. That worked out fine and our child felt fine after eating it. The rest of us felt nauseated afterwards. 
We used to really love eating there but the quality of the ingredients have gone down and prices have gone up. We are sad and disappointed because it used to be so good that we went there for birthday meals. We will not be back. Too bad....it used to be delicious."}
{"text":"Streets of New York - Where People and Pizza are Their Passion

As first time visitors to the Scottsdale area, we wanted to experience a local restaurant that we did not have back home.  We chose an Italian restaurant near the Scottsdale Links Resort where we were staying that was listed in our Vacation Planner - Streets of New York.  We went there on our first night in town.  The restaurant is located in the nearby Target & Albertson shopping center and we easily found parking directly in front of the restaurant.  Since it was summertime, the place was not busy.

As we walked in the door, we were immediately greeted and invited to sit wherever we wished.  We chose a large corner booth up front. I glanced around in the soft glow in the restaurant and thought how lovely it looked with the sun setting outside.  Mirrors on the walls helped make the place look larger as well as give everyone a view of the two large mounted flat screen TVs broadcasting muted sporting events.  Along one wall were booths with multiple attractive overhead hanging lighting fixtures.   In the center were tables for four and chairs. A lovely free-standing tall outdoor street lighting fixture stood toward the rear of the restaurant reminiscent of one you might have found on a street corner in ole New York City.   Where we sat we had a good view of the open kitchen as did almost every other table & booth.  The Take-Out Counter was conveniently located just inside the entrance.

 Soon our server, Michelle, came over, handed us menus and took our beverage orders.  After perusing the menu, we all decided that Eggplant Rollatini, $10.50 sounded great.  It came with your choice of pasta and sauce.  Three of us chose Fettuccine with Marinara sauce.  Our fourth diner ordered the entrée with Penne and Bolognese sauce.  While we waited for our meal, Michelle brought over a basket of  their Signature  Passion Bread tossed with Garlic Butter  and Parmesan Cheese.  The warm bread was delicious and served with a mild Marinara-style  dipping sauce. We scoffed up every last piece.   In no time, Michelle offered to replenish the basket.  

Only one member of our party could finish the entrée.  The rest of us took home leftovers - enough for another whole meal.  Michelle gave us extra sauce for our leftovers.  We were too full for dessert.  We all felt that we had received great value for our meals with excellent service in a very pleasant setting.  Even with the open kitchen and a setting sun, the restaurant was refreshingly cool.  

Since the place was not too busy, Michelle had time to chat with us.  She told us that Streets of New York is actually a chain restaurant with 26 locations mostly in Arizona - two are in Las Vegas.  The chain is family owned since 1976.  It is the official pizza of both the Arizona Diamondbacks and the Phoenix Suns.  Unfortunately, we didn't know that before we ordered.  She said that wings are very popular, also.  

We all had such a good experience that we all agreed to return several nights later for another meal.  Michelle was not on duty on our second visit but Assistant Manager Denise was and she was just as friendly and professional as was Michelle.  We decided to order different entrees from our previous visit.  I ordered an extra large Cheese Calzone, $9.50.  My husband ordered Chicken Pesto with Penne, $10.25.  The two other members of our party ordered Lorrie's Lasagna, $10.50.  We all enjoyed our meals as much as on the previous visit.  We joked quite a bit with Denise.  We even called over the Manager, Mike Kelley to praise both servers.  OK we kidded around first about Denise a bit but she was excellent - very attentive and competent plus a lot of fun, too. How often do you get to have instant rapport with a server - in this case two servers and a Manager? 

If we are ever back in the Scottsdale area, we will be sure to return to this restaurant for pizza.  The menu is mostly pizza, pasta and subs - great for a casual meal.   Broaster Chicken is now served at many of their locations.  You can also find seven different salads including Antipasto and several different soups.  Italian Wedding Soup is one that I always enjoy and they have added it to their menu.  Children ten and under  have five choices, $2.25-$4.50.  If you decide to visit, come at Happy Hour which is more than an hour - Monday through Friday, 2:30 - 6 pm.  House wine is $4 a glass then and there are several menu specials.  Alternatively, dine at lunch for their several Lunch Specials such as Six Wings & a Slice of Pizza for $6.95 or Soup and Salad for $5.95.  You just cannot beat the prices and the service too.  Thanks Mike, Denise and Michelle for two fun filled enjoyable evenings."}
{"text":"Broaster chicken is AHmazing! 

This is hands down the best chicken you will ever have in your life.  It is crispy, unbelievably moist and juicy, flavorful, and just plain delicious!

In addition, the meals are a bargain. A 2 piece chicken meal with door stop sized crispy potato wedges and a side of your choice is only $5.95. That's crazy!! 

Come for the chicken! Stay for the pizza. Better yet order chicken and pizza to share! Yum."}
{"text":"We've been back twice to eat in and had a delivery since our negative experience. Very pleased with the differences in experiences & customer service. Our go to choices are still the Broaster chicken and New York combo. Keep it up! We'll be back."}
{"text":"First pizza joint I've gone to since moving to Scottsdale. I was very satisfied with how excellent the service was and the pizza was delicious! I'll be back."}
{"text":"I picked up a take our order that had not been tended to by the staff. There seemed to be a communication breakdown and instead of taking ownership they simply informed me that the food would be right out. As time passed the employee at register informed me it would be another ten minutes. They had not actually started the order until around when I walked in. 

After that, a manager type named Lavine approached me very angrily explaining that it was not their fault. I said that it was fine I just needed to know what the situation was as I had people
Waiting on the food. She raised her voice at me in a very unprofessional and unpleasant tone. I supposed she has a bad day but I am mot sure why I was her target. 

Four employees approached me and APOLOGIZED FOR THEIR MANAGERS BEHAVIOR. 

How embarrassing for those kids. Owner please reach out. Your leadership needs attention."}
{"text":"This place, hands down IS THE BEST!  The service is outstanding, the food is incredible, and the atmosphere is fun yet family friendly!  I highly recommend checking this place out!  You will NOT be disappointed!  The pizza and wings are a must try while you are there!  The sauce has this fantastic taste to it like no other!  They also bring out the BEST garlic bread and sauce I think that I have ever had!  I cannot rave enough about this place!"}
{"text":"Waited for about 10 mins in an empty restaurant (literally no one was inside the restaurant) & didn't get a welcome from any of the workers who you can clearly see in the kitchen talking away & laughing. Was my first time there & going to be my last. I don't even want to give it a chance anymore after that horrible service."}
{"text":"This is solid, middle of the road pizza.  I would give it 4 stars, but I thought it was overpriced.  The good:  I thought the toppings were great and this pizza had the right amount of greasy goodness.  Also, the guy at the front was really nice when I picked up my pizza to go.  The bad:  The price and the thickness of the crust.  As evidenced by my favorite pizza joints, I do not like thick crust pizza and this was a little thick.  2 pizzas came to $50 and that just seems a little crazy town to me.  Would probably return with a coupon though."}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the last year and it hasn't been good. Luckily we had a Groupon so it made our meal cheaper, but the food was nothing special. It's definitely not New York style pizza. Also, the service was not on top of things. They were moving pretty quickly around the restaurant, but it seemed unorganized."}
{"text":"Ever since they lost their manager back at the end of 2017, and haven't replaced him, this place has gone downhill.  They can't keep any staff, the lady that says she a co-owner hardly ever visits and it's like this place is run by whoever shows up.  Food quality is down, service is down....pity as it was one of our favorite neighborhood places when it had a nice, consistent staff."}
{"text":"This is a nice place in a cute little plaza. Service is good when dining in. Can't speak for delivery or carry out since I have not yet experienced it. The only bad thing is the strong smell of cigarette smoke inside. I was surprised since most businesses do not allow smoking, and I don't even know where it was coming from. Had to sit outside, luckily it was breezy but still 105. I wish we would've been able to sit inside. However pizza is blehhh no taste hard crust definitely not NY Pizza like I've had in NY."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the pizza here, but was very surprised when I tried the wings.  They some of the best wings I've ever had.  I would get here more often but it is way out in the Northwest.  They're suppose to be opening a Southwest location soon, really looking forward to it."}
{"text":"Been looking forward to them opening in my hood and Streets did not disappoint. Been there twice in the first  2 weeks since they've been open. The pizza is great, but I was very surprised at how good the hot wings are. Will be going back often and looking forward to trying the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Way overpriced for the quality. I ordered a 16\" pizza w/2 toppings, it was $21. I thought it must be good to charge that much. The flavor was fine, but not worth it. Half the pizza was all crust. I'd go to Grimaldi's for a cheaper and better pizza."}
{"text":"The good news (sorta?): Pizza on regular crust was deeelish & wings were flavorful but barely cooked.
The turrrible news: Our server started out the six top with \"I'm new, you're gonna have to bear with me.\" Boy did we try but- 1)wrong sized beers delivered 2)no refills on fountain drinks 3)no napkins/straws/cutlery 4)food took 40 min so I'm guessing she forgot to ring it 

Manager: whyyy put someone on the floor before they're ready? Maybe you're short staffed but you're clearly losing customers due to poor service (source: rough yelp reviews) It was painfully obvious she needed a little training."}
{"text":"I ordered a large gourmet veggie pizza  and a side of 12 suicide wings last week. The pizza was really good. I liked the thin crust and the vegetables. It was a big size, and everyone filled up on it. The wings were very greasy and not very good. They were like chicken ball shaped, and not like wing. The suicide was also not that hot. 

The service was ok. The girl who took my order wasn't as friendly as she could have been. It was ready when they said though, and everything was there.

What I dont like is that I went to pick it up and it was a 33 dollar tab. That is very expensive I feel. Too much for what we got. I will just order from another place next time that is cheaper. I am glad that I got to try it though."}
{"text":"Well I was interested in ordering a pizza and chicken for deliver from here but before I could get that far the girl answering the phones was not helpful at ALL! I am visiting this area and asked if they deliver to the hotel I'm staying at. Her reply in a very friendly voice is \"yes you're just across the street\" My response was great being I'm not sure what the address is here let me see if I can find it on anything. I feel short not finding a darn thing with this places address, the girl tells me \" you can call back and we even take online orders\" and dc the call. My chin dropped before I could even say anything more. With phone service like this...I'll pass on trying this pizza place...couldn't careless how good the reviews are. Great service is more important rather its take out, deliver, or dining in! 
Work on your phone skills!"}
{"text":"The pizza was very good.  The service was very friendly.

 The outdoor deck upstairs is a nice touch that makes it a more pleasant place to eat and the decor was a hit with our children.

Good place to grab a pizza."}
{"text":"Streets on New York is my go-to place for a quick, easy, and tasty option for dinner.  I place my order to go when I leave work, and by the time I get there, it is ready.  My favorites are the Mediterranean Pizza (love the sundried tomatoes and artichokes), the pear gorgonzola salad, and the Spaghetti and Meatballs special (on Wednesdays).  I've never sat in the restaurant, so no comment on wait service, but I'm always greeted warmly by the staff when I come and pick up my food.  The fact that it is minutes from my house is definitely a benefit!"}
{"text":"I've always liked Streets but I'd never been to this location even though it's right near my home. Had the lunch special - half a sandwich and half a dozen BBQ wings.
The wings were awesome - lots of sauce, cooked perfect, crunchy without being hard to eat. The sandwich was good with lots of melted provolone and a sesame seed hoagie roll. It wasn't worth the $7 because of size, but it was a really good lunch. 
Bonus: the sodas come in giant glass steins!"}
{"text":"This is quite possibly the most incompetent staff of people I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with. I ordered from here once about nine months ago. My food arrived cold, soggy, and incorrect. Makes sense being that the driver was literally 45 min late getting to my house. When I called back to complain, I was hung up on twice. I swore I would not order from this terrible establishment again. Here, nine months later, a tragedy occurred in my community and it was promised at 30% of the profits of Streets of NY for the day would be donated to the family in need, so sucked it up and attempted to give it another try. HUGE mistake on my part. To begin, I was immediately put on hold for a crazy amount of time. I get it, people get busy. Understandable at first. Once answered, I was promptly hung up on and tried to call back to be place on hold again. Attempted to order with an few times getting the order incorrectly repeated to me a couple times. Once I had hung up, I had realized the employee had neglected to get my address so I called back. Again, placed on hold. Asked for a manager and, again hung up on. Called again put on hold. Finally, I had spoken to someone who claimed to be in charge, but really didn't didn't seem to know what was happening and neglected to solve or attend to any form of possible resolution. In sheer frustration and anger, I finally cancelled my order. My credit card has been charged and there has been NO REVERSAL. Will be filing an unauthorized charge claim tomorrow for sure. I am astounded this establishment is still in business and want to warn everyone about how incompetent, careless, rude, and thieves they are."}
{"text":"Stopped by before the game to pick-up wings and a salad. The wings were like dessert mummies dry with no sauce (we ordered Hot) the antipasto salad was 99% lettuce and no dressing. Try any place else but here."}
{"text":"The Broasted chicken was my fav. Lately it's been really really salty. I have our orders delivered. They can't seem to get our orders right. Dark meat is what we get. Breasts are NOT dark meat!!! Oh, we ate it of course. But only cuz we were really really hungry. Will give them another chance...."}
{"text":"Ok I have eaten at quite a few \"Streets\" in the valley and I don't remember eating wings like this before? Pizza was pretty good! Or server was very prompt, and food was hot when it came. She was very helpful when ordering! I just couldn't remember the wings like this? Tasted as if they had been either over baked or maybe someone ordered and they didn't want them. Reheated and given to our table. Had 12 honey hot. About half were this way and the other half a bit more fresh? Well I eat pizza a bit more than I should, so I'll try the one in Surprise next! Keep you posted folks! The beer was no joke COLD!! That was the tasty merge.... cold beer good pizza!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here with colleagues about a half dozen times spread throughout the past year.  Have had a couple of different subs, the hot wings and pizza.   All were pretty good.  The \"Best of Everything\" sub I have had 3 times and it has always been good.  Worth trying for sure.  The Pizza was nothing to rave about, but good.  The wings were tasty and cooked nicely.  

Again, nothing to get excited about but it's perfectly passable food.  

The staff have always been friendly.  I have been there when they have been busy, and when they have been slow and the service has always been reasonable.  No complaints about this place, but nothing really outstanding either.  

I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but it's not far from the office, so the occasional lunch is easy. If you're in the area, and looking for a good sub or wings, Streets is a good choice."}
{"text":"Tried the New York Combo. It was good pizza. It taste like a NY pizza to me. They open the box for you to look at before you leave. I love the service."}
{"text":"Great customer service. I've been coming here since this location opened before the 101 even went through the area. Reliably pleasant experience."}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars I would. We weren't in the restaurant for more than 5 mintues. The sign said to sit at whatever table. We chose outside because it was a beautiful cool night. The restaurant wasnt busy at all. 3 servers around the age of 17-19. One cook (that I could see), they all saw us come in. My significant other went to notify a server and he completely ignored him so we left. I'm glad it was only 5 minutes.  Dont waste your time with this place."}
{"text":"1st time to this location. Ordered chicken parmesan sandwich....very disappointing. Chicken was not fresh...tough!"}
{"text":"First, let me give you a brief background of my situation. We placed our order on Order Up. Unfortunatly that order email was sent to the store's  \"junk mail\" box. Because of this 2 hours went by.....finally I decided to call and was greeted with a very attentive employee. He quickly took my information and got the mananger on the phone (at least i'm assuming she was the manager due her professionalism). Kirstie was her name. I'm most likely spelling that wrong but close enough. Kirstie took my order number and called Order Up to investigate, promising to call me back within 5 minutes. She did just that. In the end she took full responisibilty for the problem and corrected it beyond our satisfaction.She even delivered our food personally as a token of her (and the busness') professionalism. The food was awesome, but we knew that would be the case already. 

Bottom line is that the food is great. The employees are even better. And Kirstie (spelling?) is a rock star!"}
{"text":"Great Service & Veeeery Good Pizza! I Was Craving A Perfect Slice Of Pizza For Linch At Work Today So I saw This Spot. Wakes In, Recieved smiles and a kind greeting from the staff, the young lady kindly gave me options, advised me BEFOREHAND that I'd have a short wait while they made a fresh Pizza but that I'd love it!!! This cheese slice  was perfectly amazing!!!"}
{"text":"This was an amazing dinning experience. The waitress was nice and friendly. I got the spaghetti and meatballs it had lots of sauce and meatballs were tasty and big. My fiancé got the spaghetti calzone it was huge! Came with a side of sauce also it was super cheesy. Got the beer cheese dip . Came in a huge bowl and the bread bites were huge and delicious very tasty. Needless to say we had to take to-go boxes for everything so much food and great prices for the food"}
{"text":"This place is BEST! Service is always on-point, friendly, and personable. My boyfriend and I come often during the weekend for lunch. The buffalo wings are juicy, large, and have great flavor. You can't go wrong with any of their food choices - pizza, sandwiches, and the salads are all wonderful. We will keep going back to this terrific place! Try it - you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is right by Infused Tea Lounge.  It was a good pizza spot!  I loved how much of the seasonings I could see in the sauce and cheese."}
{"text":"My bf and I ordered a 3 topping 14 inch pizza and a dozen bone in wings for $36.The wings were cold, soggy and disgusting. I put them in the toaster oven and they got a little crispy but still kinda soggy. I would have had to burn them to get them crispy. As for the pizza it tasted ok. Very bland...the sauce had no flavor. And for a $22 medium sized 3 topping pizza there should have been more toppings. I could barely see or taste any toppings. Very disappointing. For that kind of money I will never go back. Service was ok for pick up that's why I gave them 2 stars."}
{"text":"Brought a groupon so we can try this place. Thank goodness we did. Perfect pizza n wings. Cooked to perfection along with a very cold pitcher of beer. The two gentlemen that served us were very nice and always checked in with us. We just left the restaurant satisfied! We shall be back!!!"}
{"text":"I used to be a huge fan of Streets! When I first came out here in 94 you couldn't get a better pie in the valley. We used to go to the 19th ave location. But the years have not been good to my old Fav. The pizza is barely better than pizza hut anymore. It's lost a little something over the years. While the pizza is still good it's not great and who wants to pay $23.00 for an ok pie. Lately the pizza has been in the 12.00 range in regards to quality. 

This must be the reason behind this locations recent closure. Bye Bye Streets."}
{"text":"Staff always friendly-food always consistently good.  A little pricey but usually they have a groupon which will save you some cash. $26.50 for a three topping 16\" pizza?????"}
{"text":"Stopped in here on the way to another pizza bar. So glad we did. Best pizza ever! Service was amazing. I just found my new favorite place."}
{"text":"I'll never go here again. They screwed up my order the first time and then proceeded to charge my bankncatf ecgta money for a tip when I gave them a great tip even though they screwed up. I never agreed to an extra card charge and they charged anyways.  It's not worth a damn bit of your money and make sure you dont use your bank card cause they will charge without your agreement."}
{"text":"I really wanted to try the baked minestrone, but they ran out--to my amazing  luck!  I then opted for the Italian wedding instead!!  Amazing!!  The meatballs were just the right size & so full of flavor.  Even their fries were delicious!  So, I will definitely be back for more delicious surprises!!"}
{"text":"They are an amazing establishment  they donated the food for my sons make a wish and after tasting their salad and cookies I'm a fan! Try them! Trust me you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Poor tasting crust, greasy pizza, too much garlic. Atmosphere is nice but it ends there."}
{"text":"Pizza and wings were good. Service and atmosphere friendly. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"The pizza is good but not exactly what I would call NY style pizza.
I like that I can put zucchini on my pizza!!!
The creamy angel hair pasta dish with sun dried tomatoes,chicken and mushrooms is hellah yummy too....

The service however is weird....
No one ever smiles or says Hello when you walk in and on several occasions we were the only ones eating and at the same time there were 3 full on dirty tables just sitting there while the waitress sat at a table and ate her food. 
Now, I know you're thinking maybe it was a busy day and maybe that was the only time that she found to eat- Bullcrap!!!

I would never feel comfortable eating while there were customers waiting for their food along with 3 dirty tables for them to look at. Like I said this was on several occasions not just this time.... Even though we were the only ones in the restrauant I still had to call her over for refills and my pizza crust was different from what I ordered - a real bummer!!!!

So the 3 stars is only because of the food!!!!"}
{"text":"Wings were ok....whole wheat pasta must not get ordered here very often...overdone mush!! But the manager was super cool and although I was already full of eating other things like the meatballs which were good, he decided to compensate and negotiate the bill a bit. He's a good guy so don't let the crappy pasta dish sway you. Pretty good hangout!"}
{"text":"This Italian restaurant is one place that I really enjoy their food. The chicken Parmesan is excellent and the portions are huge. My friend and I couldn't even come close to finishing our plates. The chicken tasted great and the sauce is excellent. If you like chicken Parmesan, then this is the place to try. The service is friendly and attentive. The menu has a lot of different dishes offered and I look forward to going back and trying more!"}
{"text":"Who would think that streets of New York ,a pizza place ,would have some of the best \"Broasted\" chicken in town ! I am an Uber Eats driver, and I have delivered their food on several occasions, one day about a week ago I was looking for broasted chicken and had some over at streets of New York best chicken in the valley !  go get some, if you love chicken go try \"Broasted\" chicken at streets of New York"}
{"text":"**Note: 2.5 of 5 stars, not 2.

Decent food here as I'm sure they're standardized w/their sister properties, but...

This Fountain Hills location needs some TLC, better cleaning requirements, etc. Granted, I'm pretty detail-oriented and do have mild OCD, so I noticed quite a bit of crumbs on the dining room floor on the way to the restroom. Why were these crumbs here like that? There was *maybe* 1-2 more tables than mine. Can't someone take care of these?

I had to use the bathroom, but I gotta tell you, the stench in there was foul, and... it just didn't feel \"clean\". I don't believe the stench was a fleeting one, if you feel me... Like maybe w/sewage? I dunno... I'm not a plumber, but it grossed me out. I noticed someone had the larger stall and had a machine making soft noises and plugged in. I just couldn't use the other stall so I just checked my hair and washed my hands. I finally realized there was probably a mother breast pumping and then I felt bad. I just felt like knocking on her stall and suggesting she try to pump next door at Subway. Or for Pete's sake - go to Petco for that matter. Just wasn't hygienic.

My chicken parm was flavorful but chicken was overcooked (dry) and I ate a few bites and the rest went in garbage. Such an annoyance... My mom's supreme pizza (thin crust) was pretty good though! For $24...

Our service was pretty good - we got check-ins and questions answered. I hope they make some changes at this location, bc I don't want to lose them in FH (we have lost businesses in the Hills in the last couple years, and that makes me sad)."}
{"text":"By far the best pizza in the SW area. It is right up there with Metro Pizza. Glad we have a location so close to home! The garlic chicken Caesar salad is awesome!"}
{"text":"I came to Streets of New York for a painting party through Vegas Painting Parties.  It was through the lunch hours so I had to get some food.  Its the law I think.  Anyhow, I got the lunch special featuring a half sandwich and a cup of soup.  The sandwich was good.  I got the Italian sandwich with capicolla, ham and salami.  The bread was lightly toasted and had a nice crunch to it.  The meats, cheese and veggies had a lot of flavor.  No complaints on that end.  And my sandwich plate camae with a handful of potato chips too.  They were just chips out of a bag I think.  Not anything like homemade chips.  That was a little disappointing but since I was not expecting chips any in the first place I did not mind.  The soup is where my interest was lost.  I ordered wedding soup as it is one of my favorites and I rarely get it because I rarely see it anywhere.  I really did not care for it much at all.  The broth was not the light clear broth I am used to with wedding soup.  It was actually kind of thick and very salty.  I'm glad I got just a cup because a full bowl would have been too much for me to take down.  I can't say much for the service as I was in a crowded area with fellow aspiring painters.  It was quick service as much as can be expected from the situation so I don't necessarily have any complaints but I don't have any outstanding compliments either.  Consider me Swiss (neutral)."}
{"text":"I love the location on Shea and 92nd.  The manager is wonderful and the food consistent. They handle our last minute large groups very well."}
{"text":"Love this location!  Great service; friendly and helpful without being cloying and annoying.   Food has been GREAT every time.  I quit going to a few closer to home but always hit this one when I'm anywhere near there."}
{"text":"Well, true to my word I give (almost) every place a second chance and I did.  I've been there a number of times since that first review and have had nothing but stellar service and great food. So there you go then.  Second chances pay off!"}
{"text":"Awesome broasted chicken which you can't get everywhere. Great pizza too. Fun for families or nice for just 2."}
{"text":"I have ordered pizza from here a couple of times to be delivered. The last pizza I got I ordered the thin and crispy crust. The only thing they got right was the thin. You could not even hold a piece of pizza in your hand because it was so floppy. I will not be ordering from there again. I should have picked up a pizza from Papa Murphy's and baked it myself. It would've tasted better and been a lot cheaper!"}
{"text":"If you do get served (15 minutes after you seat yourself, hello?) your pizza choices are thin \"New York style\" or extra thin and crispy. I wanted \"New York-Style\" and what I got was thicker than Hungry Howie's with entirely too much cheese and the red sauce was strangely hotter than the crust and cheese - I burned my mouth, even after waiting a few minutes for it to cool down.
There is no way in hell you're going to be able to hold a slice and fold it lengthwise with one hand - the crust is entirely too thick. This is NOT a New York style pizza."}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious!!! I especially love the crust and the fact that they don't charge extra after 3 toppings :)"}
{"text":"Seriously? Shut up. This place blows. Wouldn't last 4 minutes in NY. I'll bet the Vegas store doesn't last either.  This place insults the pizza."}
{"text":"Love it here! I usually get takeout but the few times I have been in, Jason has been my server. He is always polite and has great customer service. One night I did not like how my food was prepared, he noticed I wasn't eating and after explaining, he made sure I received a new meal immediately. The girls there are friendly but always seem more interested in talking amongst themselves."}
{"text":"We received a coupon for buy one, get one entree. To be fair, it advertised \"value\", maybe the first sign of trouble. We ordered the pizza with extra sauce of which there turned out to be barely any. The pizza smelled of little more than burned garlic, and may have been two different pizzas combined as two halves seemed cooked to different degrees. The \"signature crust\" was basically a Dominoes crust, frozen, not fresh most likely. The sausage in the Napolitano pasta was listed as crumbled, but it came in strips? The angel hair was spaghettini. The sauce was not as good as Trader Joes sauce in flavor. Steer clear of this place unless you only priority is \"Value\", though it was no bargain compared to the cheapo chains IMHO."}
{"text":"My personal favorite restaurant in the area. This place is more like a family then just customer service, Jason and Brittany always know me when I come in, always the top of the line customer service from their entire staff, great food and drink prices, friendly atmosphere, just the best I could expect from a restaurant. I will always be coming back here"}
{"text":"I can't recommend them for delivery. I have been to other locations both eating in and delivering when i lived out of this area and always enjoyed their food.  Now I live near this one and doesn't taste anything like the other locations at all.  I gave it two attempts, will not be calling them any longer.  The antipasto salad came wilted and container was only filled half way...that was $10?? The artichoke spinach dip that is to die for at other locations has no flavor and tastes like mayo here.  The garlic bread had no garlic flavor at all, appeared to be toasted plain bread.  Ordered two dozen wings, medium sauce, came with no sauce at all...just plain wings....$50 seemed so overpriced for this...never again!"}
{"text":"Our server, Gina, was very attentive. The prices were very reasonable. After reading the reviews, I wish we met Robert. The desert sounds delicious ;-). The food was really good for our family. We ordered two \"Number One's\", and they were delicious. We ordered a pizza slice on the kids menu, and it was excellent, inexpensive, and huge! The fries were good, thin, and crisp. The meatball sub was one of the best my wife has ever had, and the pasta salad was excellent and just as good to her. Sadly we were just passing through, because that place could be a regular for us if it weren't well over an hour from home."}
{"text":"Love this pizza! Does take more time than expected to make a slice of pizza... that must be why it's the best tasting pizza I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"Fantastic ...Service.. Front counter staff were super friendly and eager to serve true pros ., Pizza was Made way beyond expectations ... Prob best Pizza ever made... ! This was Saturday 04/01/2017 About 1pm  at the Tatum and Greenway Location... If every Bus . Was run By a crew like this every bus would be a success."}
{"text":"Meh. 

the hubs has a hard on for this place and I cant really figure out why. Vito's down the street is ten times better. 

They do have green olives, so that's a plus in my book. 

Its really just pretty average pizza, nothing great, but not dominos or pizza hut either."}
{"text":"Very few places can provide a delicious gluten free pizza and this place is one of them! Not only was the pizza good, but the staff was friendly and the service was speedy."}
{"text":"Pizza is usually good but I am beyond frustrated with this restaurant. The last three times I have used their website online ordering my order has been lost and my card charged. The previous two times I called and my order was delivered after more than two hours. Tonight I called and after explaining that I ordered and it was never delivered the person on the phone took my name and said \"we will call you back.\" I told him to cancel my order and he hung up the phone. I called back, he was flustered and apologetic, but now I have to track to make sure my card is refunded. Such a pain! I was a customer for years, I will stick to Rosati's on Durango from now on.

Update- The manager called and apologized, and informed me they would give me a $30 credit. I appreciate the customer service on this occasion."}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved into the area from Pennsylvania, so needless to say, we spend a lot of time in New York.

Both of us agreed that this was the closest to real New York Style cuisine that we've had in America outside of New York. 

We were pleasantly surprised to find this place after a failed attempt at watching the Fountain Park fountain as it never actually went off (we had no clue about the monsoon coming). 

We arrived at quarter to nine and the server still seated us even though it was close to closing time and was very polite about it at that. I really respect a restaurant that will seat you near closing time because they genuinely want to serve you and aren't just counting down the minutes to go home. Manager, please praise your staff that was working last night (Sunday around 8:30-9:30 pm) they did a fantastic job. (Server AND chefs) 

We ordered the honey golden baked wings, an 18\" sweet corn pizza, and a slice of cheesecake.

Passion Bread - This stuff...I don't even know where to start. My husband and I are generally low carb eaters, however we literally couldn't stop ourselves. This bread was SO good. You can tell it's home made and has a lot of...well...passion baked into it. It's amazing. The marinara sauce that came with it was not that chunky crap you get from TGIFridays, it was REAL marinara. Just really great. We ate the entire basket to ourselves before our wings even came it was really embarrassing. (Sorry, mom) 

Honey Golden Baked Wings - These were amazing. I don't even like mustard but I ordered these because my husband loves honey mustard and for someone who won't even have mustard on a hot dog, I LOVED them. I would definitely order these again and I'm excited to come back to try a couple of different flavors during your Appy Hour. 

Sweet Corn Pizza - This thing was HUGE. Massive. I don't even know where to start but the pesto was PERFECTLY portioned on (not too much but still there), the cheese was perfectly portioned and melted, the tomatoes tasted like they came from a 5 star restaurant, the corn was a brilliant idea, the arugula and olive oil just gave it that perfect balance of freshness, and the dough was out of this world (basically the pizza dough version of the passion bread...brilliant). 

Cheesecake - Now, we ordered the cheesecake after close, so they didn't have any cherry topping, which the cheesecake really needed, but it wasn't the restaurants fault as they were out for the night and I would for sure come back again during open hours to try it. However, the cheesecake was EXTREMELY rich, which I understand is New York style, but just as a personal preference, I do like the lighter whipped cheesecakes. 

We had all of these for...wait for it...$40. Now, I would tell you that I would pay $40 for the pizza alone, however I don't want you to put your prices up so I won't tell you that. 

We had an amazing experience and really would like to commend your staff for how professional and friendly they were, especially thankful for them letting us wait out a bit of the storm inside while we enjoyed a delicious meal. 

We will be returning and recommending this place to our friends and family."}
{"text":"The service was amazing for take out and he told me I'll love it and we did!! Pizza was close to East Coast taste, very good, wings were delicious, restaurant had a nice bar to hang out at and prices were decent. Glad we had a Groupon as we'll definitely be ordering from here again. Even good place for a date night!"}
{"text":"I was just so disappointed since I usually love streets of New York but this location I will never come to again.  The burnt hot wings were one thing but cold pizza and bad service when we were the only customer in the place is just a waste of money."}
{"text":"Out to dinner with my hubby. Our waitress started us off with drinks.  A large family who came in after us is now giving their waiter their order. AND OURS IS MIA...She said she had a large group inside. Once we got our order, and I ordered a garlic chicken pear salad the first bite my fork cut my lip. SO CHECK YOUR  SILVERWARE!! Couldn't eat my dinner as the dressing stung my lip. Needless to say, our out to dinner evening was ruined. We paid our bill and had to take my salad home. It's now in my frig. Hope it will be worth eating tomorrow.  Well we will think twice about a return visit.  And of so, will definitely check our forks."}
{"text":"Delicious buffalo chicken pizza... and kids chicken tenders. Great service. We will be back."}
{"text":"This place has really good chicken fingers but I was pissed. On a FRIDAY NIGHT at 9:30 I came to eat before close and they LOCKED THE DOOR WHEN THEY CLOSED AT 10. They refused to even look at me and I was ready to place a big order  each time I've went there the service has been terrible and this was the last"}
{"text":"Yelp 100 Challenge - 2018  #73

I'm a sucker for any pizza place with great reviews.

This was my first time visiting this location but all of them are roughly the same. This Streets of New York is located across the street from Walmart and directly beside Veggie Street. 

Menu:
They offer a huge selection of New York style foods. They also offer a lunch menu and happy hour menu. 

I lucky made it just before the end of lunch and ordered a slice of pizza and wings. My pizza was so yum that I wanted another slice. They also offer 2 slice lunch special but I opted for one. 

Game/ Trivia Night:
This location like the others offer game/ trivia night one night during the week. The place gets pretty packed on Trivia nigh so I suggest getting their early unless you'll be stuck at the bar."}
{"text":"I've been to several Streets locations over the years and I've never had a bad experience. I'm picking this one to rate because I've been coming here a lot more lately.

It seems the service is different each time we come. Sometimes they give free bread with sauce, which is a lovely starter while we wait for yummy pizza. We usually come at night and they are always attentive and never get our order wrong. 

Today our lunch lacked in service. Our waitress never came around to the table, she never brought us bread. We literally watched this woman bring bread to every table around us, but skip us, it was so weird. A nice man who is usually there finally brought us some after he noticed the woman kept skipping our table. I had to get up to ask someone for our check as well. It happens!

Regardless of today's lackluster service, I do loveee the pizza. Great crust, which is a must for me! I'll still come back for as long as they are open. Also would love more e-club coupons. These days I find myself only going to businesses that send out coupons."}
{"text":"RUDE management, tasteless food, overpriced. 

Don't waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"Nothing wrong with this place it's not bad but it's not true ny pizza. It's slightly pricey but the quality is good. My main issue is serving Pepsi with pizza but that's a personal issue in Arizona with most places serving Pepsi. Three stars reflect is not being great but also not bad. Generally average. We did have really awesome service."}
{"text":"Used to be a favorite spot but it has gone down in quality ALOT. Lack of consistency and poor food quality has driven us away. Each time we ordered we would say \"let's give them one more try\" but after many chances and disappointment we've decided we're all set. One time I ordered an individual slice of pizza and asked to add pineapple and when I received my slice it seriously was awful. The cook took pizza from the night before (we came in right when they opened and I knew the pizza was not fresh) , heated it up, then threw on cold fruit cup of pineapple.... which in turn made it a soggy sorry pizza slice.. I mean seriously? Wouldn't one think to add pineapple to the pizza then put it into the oven??"}
{"text":"What an awful experience! Service was lacking in everyway. What I wanted to order was no longer on menu. However, menu stated \"new\".When food came out, I lost my appetite.Left
Asap! HORRIBLE"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good here. Menu has some unique stuff and all the kids liked their meals. The beer cheese and bread is awesome, and BBQ pizza good too. Would go again."}
{"text":"1 Word. Yucky.

I guess I have \"high standards\" being from New York, but between the pizza and the grossly overpriced, watery sauced, rubbery \"Chicken Parmigiana\", I don't think I'll be making a return visit to this place.

Mediocre service. I've had much better, and in a climate with such fierce competition for the consumer's dollar - I think they should try harder."}
{"text":"The Manager, Kelly, is a joke.  All of the other Streets of New York honored the July 4th, 20% special, EXCEPT for your location.  My parents along with their group of church friends went to Pullanos and were much happier with the food and service.  Your location gets terrible reviews, because your food takes FOREVER to come out, AND the manager is terrible! Maybe you'll take the hint when your place is even more emptier than it is now.  LMAO!!"}
{"text":"Every time I order they forget the ranch or give me the wrong pizza.  No more from this place.  Marcos just opened up.  We'll see how long the streets last"}
{"text":"My wife and I stumbled upon this place the other day while waiting for our sandwich to be made at the Sinful Subs. We pass this place all the time, but never been inside. 

The decor was inviting. We didn't know there was a cute little bar there! So we sat at the bar, ordered a few drinks while we wait. The service was great. Totally personable which we like. There were several TVs playing the hockey game which we loved. The owners were sitting at the bar, overheard our convo about the sandwich we were waiting on at the other place, and therefore said we could try there's and decide for ourselves which is best. We thought that was a great idea! They comped that, so all we paid for was our drinks. 

The drinks weren't pricey at all, and during happy hour it was even cheaper. Which is nothing!! 

We would definitely be back to try the food. Oh! And the sandwich was yummy, but gotta admit, Sinful Subs won for us. 

It'll definitely be our spot to hang out at the bar to watch the game or to be regulars at since it's close to us."}
{"text":"Put in an order as we just finished traveling for the day. We looked at the menu and we had some high hopes. We saw that they offered a shrimp calzone. Sounded interesting....but when we called for the order, they were out of it. So we opted for an equally-yummy-sounding chicken alfredo calzone. We also ordered a dozen hot wings. Our food came within the quoted 45 minute timeframe but it was cold when we got it. Strike one for sure. The calzone was a complete dissapointment. It was totally bland and was overwhelmed with ricotta cheese. If one thing is going to overwhelm a calzone, it prefer it to be the actual associated with the name ingredients--chicken, alfredo, mozzarella, etc. The wings were just gross. I can't believe that I ever called any type of chicken wing gross, but they were. The sauce was weak and watery (or greasy) and did not stick to the wings. They were a soggy, greasy, tasteless mess. Such a ruined evening of ordered-in food."}
{"text":"Very very good food. Very slow delivery, very very expensive. 18 in pizza 2 toopings, 24 wings, passion bread is $56!!!!"}
{"text":"I have had numerous company lunches from here and finally decided to order delivery for dinner. Their menu online is extensive and there are quite a few different versions (some old and some new). When I called to place my order, I asked if the item I wanted was available and the woman taking my order confirmed it was. Happy, I placed an order for a veggie pesto pizza with mushrooms, artichokes, and tomatoes. I also ordered the beer battered combo - this included some deep fried onion rings, mozzarella sticks, and zucchini sticks. I was told my order would be delivered in 45 minutes. I wasn't keeping track of time, but it did arrive on time or earlier and was piping hot. The pizza itself was delicious. The beer battered items were good but not the best. (They were still crispy but I've had better.) My husband enjoyed both and if the craving strikes, we'll probably order from here again."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant, this one's food and service are quite good. Everything is hot and fresh. Save room for a Passion Cookie for dessert. This one has better food and service than the other SONY restaurants we have gone to."}
{"text":"We ordered the baked hot wings and they were fantastic. The pepperoni pizza was ok and unfortunately arrived cold. The marguerite pizza was so-so and also not hot. I think the pizza would have been much better had it just arrived warm."}
{"text":"Every time I order from here, it's super late. This time, over 45 minutes paste the expected delivery time. Cold, soggy onion rings. Luke warm pizza with stiff cheese. 

Luckily I was pretty baked out of my skull, so at least it was food. It's not far, I should have just picked it up. 

Always get reminded that the \"online tip thing doesn't work, so write it in\". Thanks. 

That being said, when the pizza is fresh, it's delicious. I like the square pizza slices."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix for a few days and needed delivery Italian! The menu had great variety so I went with the spinach artichoke dip, chicken Parm with spaghetti! I just have to say the DIP was the best I have ever had pared with the little garlic toast pieces, it really hit the spot! The chicken Parm my daughter ate it all up and said yummy also! Definitely recommend! Super fast delivery also"}
{"text":"When a woman walks into a restaurant PLEASE stop saying \"hey guys\"! It is very disrespectful.  Teaching your staff the basics is a start.  Food was terrible, broasted (dried out over fried carcass) chicken with so disappointing.  It took the waitress 5 minutes to check and to be informed we did not receive all the food we ordered.  Then treated as if we were interrupting her socializing with her friends.  What a lame experience."}
{"text":"I will never get food from here again. I placed an online order for delivery and was given a delivery time of an hour. About 40 minutes later I got a call from the store saying there was a problem with the online order and they took the order again over the phone as well as my credit card number. Turns out that they double charged me, got the order wrong, and I had to wait another hour to boot. I tried to call to get a credit, and after a few days got a text that an amount not matching mine had been credited to a card ending with 4 digits not matching mine.  This was a month and a half ago. The owner won't return calls and the staff won't help. I disputed with the bank and he won't call them back so now I have to cancel my debit card to get my credit. 

Streets of New York you've seen the last of me."}
{"text":"Completely disappointed. I love Streets but this branch? It took 1 hour and 17 minutes for delivery, just got the food, and still was nice with a decent tip, then open the box and no marinara for the bread and worst? - The Pizza itself was cold. Literally cold. It's almost like, \"Thanks for your hard earned money, here's your \"food\". Peace.\" So disappointed with this branch. Go to a different one or elsewhere all together. Never write reviews let alone as I sit here having to warm it up because gotta eat, especially after a long hard week at the office. Wow. Just wow.

Oh yeah, did I mention lived in Brooklyn (Crown Heights) NYC? This one hurts. Really hurts. Rays Pizza is worth the travel from Old Town, Scottsdale. It's as close as you'd get to true NYC Pizza. Try there."}
{"text":"So far so good. I had 2 NY combo slices, that were great. I will definitely come back & explore the menu further. As far as authenticity, Streets of New York's interior reminds me of a few Italian places in Coney Island, Brooklyn & Greenwich Village, NY. The plus is I actually had to double park. That's as close to original you're gonna get in Vegas."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Brittany the waitress is the BEST waitress we have EVER had! There are days we aren't in the mood for pizza/Italian food but we pick Streets just because we know we will get amazing service from Brittany. Not that the rest of the waitress staff is bad but we have left if Brittany is not working that day. She is so personable, remembers us and our \"usuals\" down to the drinks, and goes out if her way to ensure we are taken care of. There is so much to say about her but I wouldn't have enough room to write it all. The food is great here but Brittany really makes the environment come to life!!! Streets of New York on Bell and 7th St is our go to restaurant because of her."}
{"text":"Eating here since Jan'17 My salad is ALWAYS served in an ice cold bowl.  The service has always been great.  Everyine is chill snd the food is amazing."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza the cheese tastes real good. Not bad on the price. Cheese bread good, service was good also they have other items to choose from in the menu. Its a small restaurant but nice layaout n vibe to it..they also sell slices..id come bak again.."}
{"text":"We've been eating here for years.  Love the pizza and awesome wings. My favorite sandwich is the New York Cheesesteak.  Delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"First night during our Arizona vacation we had dinner here. They have other items on the menu if you don't want pizza. There were four of us and we had a large pepperoni pizza. It was good.

Tried the beer cheese dip with bread for dipping. It was okay. If we were to go back there I'd definitely have pizza, wouldn't order the beer cheese again."}
{"text":"This was my second time ordering take out from here. Both times I had bad experiences. I'm done with Streets of New York. 

Both times the delivery took about an hour and 15 minutes. I understand they were busy. However, when my food got here, it was cold and the ice cream was completely melted. Both times the delivery guy said they were lost in my apartment complex and they had to \"walk all over\". There's a map in the front of every apartment complex. 

This time I ordered a pepperoni calzone. Besides being cold, it had a really funny taste. Also, the pepperoni were stacked together in 2 places inside. There were literally 6 pepperoni stacked up. I didn't even eat it. 

The cookie dessert I got was burnt and the ice cream for the top was completely melted. I'm so disappointed in Streets of New York."}
{"text":"The menu has many options for a quick and healthy dinner! I really like the gorg pear salad. Also,
the portions are large enough to get two meals out of one order. Lastly, the delivery guy is really nice and polite and the service is quick. Will be ordering again!"}
{"text":"Love, love Streets!  Great thick crust pizza, broasted chicken, all pastas.  We've been coming here for years and the quality is always the best.  Servers are all personable and friendly.  I would highly recommend Streets of New York at 7th St. & Bell!!"}
{"text":"There employees are outstanding.  The food quality lately is very poor.  my second time ordering a canzone and it was not cooked all the way.  it was gross. I had this delivered so I called this time and complained and asked them to credit my account back.  after some persistence on my part, Carlos the manager agreed.  He wanted to give me credit for my next visit, there will not be anymore visits."}
{"text":"Nice Local neighborhood pizza place. Italian sub, bread knots and Mediterranean pizza are my personal favorites. The owner and staff are all friendly and accommodating.  Def need to stop in if you live in the area."}
{"text":"We've been coming to this location for years and haven't had a bad experience yet. They recently renovated the place and it looks great! The staff are alway courteous and smiling, the pizza is away delish and their baked wings are always perfectly crispy. I tried the Broaster Chicken and it was BOMB! I usually have a hard time deciding what to order. ? It's a great neighborhood spot where we always feel welcome. Five out of five stars! UPDATE: We've moved 30 minutes away and I still try to come back anytime I'm in the area. The food is that good!"}
{"text":"This is a tentative score, as I feel I should probably give this a place another couple tries before I can form a final opinion. The atmosphere and decore do not reflect the NYC theme, and while the menu did have several classics associated with the city such as pizza, pasta and certain sandwiches, there is a large separate menu dedicated to fried chicken every possible way, which I didn't expect. So I decided to try the chicken; it was pretty good. The service was delayed, which the waiter apologized for, but very friendly. I want to try their pizza and sandwiches next time hoping for a more authentic New York streets experience."}
{"text":"Excellent service and amazing pizza. The folks are friendly and the food is excellent."}
{"text":"The broaster chicken...Oh Lawd was soooo delicious we went 2 days in a row! 

Broaster chicken: 5/5 
All I have to say is TRY IT! We usually don't order fried chicken from places because it always tastes better home cooked but boy oh boy...we went 2 days in a row because it was just that damn good! The skin is super crispy and the chicken is packed with flavor and oh so moist! You don't even need hot sauce or ketchup etc. But if you like hot sauce they have house-made hot sauce that so tasty. 

Meatballs: 4/5 
they were moist and delicious. The marinara sauce was tasty and they put a lot of cheese on top. Really good to dip the complimentary bread in. 

Pizza: 4/5 
We got the 10\" half 'new yorker' (I think is the name but it's the supreme toppings) and the other half was their meat lovers. the pizza was was crispy, lots of toppings, and the crust was yummy! 

Potato wedges: 2/5 
Wasn't really a fan of the wedges. They were hot and fresh but kinda cut to big and you can tell they were just frozen then fried and not house made. (sorry if they are, just didn't impress me.)"}
{"text":"We've eaten here several times. My grand kids came to visit us for Christmas. They love pizza, so what better place to bring them to..Streets of NY. There were seven of us and our server was very patient and took care of the kids first with color crayons. We order the large chopped antipasto salad which I could eat as a meal but we split it four ways and was wonderful.

Our server was knowledgeable and accommodating. She really added he personality to the dining experience.

We ordered the extra large, 18\" on a thin crust, but was told only 16\" and below can be made with a thin crust.

All in all, it was a great place for the kids and adults to have dinner."}
{"text":"Have ordered here may times and always disappointing. Yesterday, 1 18\" pizza, 24 boneless wings and fried apps, $65! Everything was delivered cold, half of the boneless wings were the size of a quarter, $22! $0.92 for a quarter size boneless wing! I called to express how upset I was and the person who answers the phone is rude and ignorant and tells me to call the general manager tomorrow. I call back and ask for the on call manager and it's the first woman who had answered the phone!  LOL Arrogant and rude, not a clue. \"Well want do you want me to do about it?\"  Really?  How about a little customer service. The entire staff is like this every time I go in there which yesterday was my last."}
{"text":"We ordered a pizza, soup and lasagna last night. Everything was great but the lasagna. It was disgusting. I had been craving lasagna all day and my first reaction was that it looked like an enchilada. It was salty and it tasted like shit. $12 gone to waste. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Tasty food--have never had a bad meal at any of their locations--for many years!!!  While they are deservedly well known for delish pizza and pasta and Sandwiches, their simple green side salad is a total wow -- always fresh and crisp. Servers are friendly and savvy. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Delivery- Let's start with the fact that it took over n hour to get my food, 
Food- which wasn't even COOKED like they rushed to get it out door , pizza was doughy and cheese was rock solid like plastic and cold.... the fries were raw meaning they threw them in to be cooked and 2-5 seconds later they pulled them out to be \"ready to-go\" ...... I'm not one to write reviews unless they are good but with a 4$ delivery fee and 3$ tip I am mad I paid 30$ for this crap !!! Never ever again !!! Wouldn't even give it to a homeless man cuz it's that fowell"}
{"text":"Highly recommend Streets of New York!
We ordered two pizza's for delivery, not only did  they come earlier then expected, the delivery lady was Awesome.  I had order one with no cheese due to my daughters food allergy. When it showed up it had cheese on it. The delivery person was so apologetic and said keep it and I will be right back with another one. ( she said that sometimes online order may over look details) She was back within 15 minutes and also called to apologize that she was not there faster. Pizza was very good!!!"}
{"text":"I am new to the area and heard this was a pretty good place to go. So I figured I would head there and watch some football and have some lunch. The pictures of the food look delicious and it seems they have some recognition with being the official pizza restaurant of the Cardinals and Diamondbacks. Do yourself a favor and skip this place. The TV's were all connected to a non-HD Directv receiver. Is it that difficult to pay the extra $10 per month per receiver to have high definition? When I walked in the sign said please seat yourself which I hate because it typically means poor service. I gave them a chance. I sat down for over 15 minutes and not once did anyone come greet me or ask me if I had been waited on yet. Meanwhile three sets of people had come in after me and were already waited on and served their drinks. I definitely will not give this place the time of day again and I'm glad they are not an \"official\" anything for the Coyotes."}
{"text":"Food was just ok but our service was pretty good. Julianne was our server and she was great about refilling drinks, the food took forever to come out which was surprising since it was just soso, but it was brought over immediately after being placed in window. Ambience is fun with a live entertainer. Might give it one more try to see if it was just an off night for food. Overall an adequate experience."}
{"text":"I like this location a lot. I come here at lunch sometimes and they are quick to get me in and out. They're always friendly and get my picky order correct. My only gripe would be that it's a small place so sometimes when the employees speak to each other from a distance, it's loud enough that everyone can hear it clearly."}
{"text":"Slow service... Ok food. There is a streets in anthem with better service and fresher food."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place since I moved to Arizona. My wife and I went there for lunch yesterday, and we decided to try the chicken. After all, Rosati's Pizza would be tough to beat. The chicken was OUTSTANDING! Perfectly cooked, lightly battered, and pressure cooked. Not greasy, not salty, just plain perfection. The side dishes were excellent as well. From the hot, fresh bread dipped in marinara, to the cole slaw and macaroni salad and potato wedges; everything was delicious and reasonably priced. We will definitely be going back. Eventually, I will try the pizza but like I said it's hard to beat Rosati's or Old Chicago."}
{"text":"Not New York style pizza at all. I ordered delivery and I'm not sure if it was intentional but there was no sauce on my pizza. Just cheese and dough. The dough is thick and fluffy. When I think of New York style pizza I think of thin crust. And sauce. I'm so confused as to why anyone would make a pizza with no sauce on it or think that's what I wanted. I like that they used a lot of spices and it was flavorful but other than that, meh."}
{"text":"The pizza sauce was non-existent, the cheese was hard, and it was overwhelmingly over seasoned. Even the sausage and pepperoni lacked something. The crust was over cooked and bland. 

They decided it would be a great idea to wrap the garlic cheese bread with the cheese facing out and wrapped tightly so by the time I got it home (10 minutes away) the cheese had completely stuck to the aluminum foil. Not to mention the bread itself was only edible in the middle (the dogs wouldn't even eat it).

I was so excited to try this pizza because I'd read good reviews, but the reviewers obviously never had good pizza before. For almost $30 for a medium sausage & pepperoni pizza and two slices of garlic bread, I could have had a better pizza from Dominos.

The only reason I gave it one star is because it was ready quickly. Oh, and when I walked in it smelled like rotting fish.
Never again...

This is the location on Norman Rockwell."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Streets of New York on two occasions now. Being from NY myself, I have high expectations of pizza being called New York pizza. On both occasions, I was very let down by the quality of the pizza. By no means is this NY pizza! I also found the service to be only adequate. The servers I encountered I found to be cold and unfriendly. I won't go back here again and waste my money!"}
{"text":"\"And don't come back ever you are not welcome here\" Mike the Managers words because he accused me of having an agenda to be confrontational by bringing two dogs which are Therapy not Service dogs to this establishment. 

He was rude and unwilling to view the letter from the doctor and employees refused to give me owners name.  Police were called and Mike threatened to have me arrested for trespassing."}
{"text":"Save your money....Take your hunger elsewhere.

I ordered delivery from this location with a coworker at 12:50PM; the order didn't arrive until 2:10PM.

We ordered a hot pastrami sandwich, a cold cut sandwich and two orders of fries.

Let's start with the two orders of fries..If that is what you can call them.  Should be called cold, soggy and limp potato sticks. No flavor. Poor texture. Actually became thankful for the lack of portions so we didn't have to suffer through them any longer.

The pastrami meat was pretty decent, yet cold. The cheese wasn't what it should be..Cheesy and melty. It was melted at one point but by the time the sandwich arrived the cheese was just a cold slab of yellowish concrete. They included a pickle...Should have been a nice addtion but it was severly wilted and warm as it was stored on top of what was once a hot sandwich.

As for the cold cut sammie, the bread was soft and delicous. But it defintely didn't meet the \"#1\" sandwich as listed on their website. 4 thin slices of meat were hidden in loads of lettuce, tomoatoes and an overwhelming amount of onions.

Order at your own risk."}
{"text":"We dined here for the first time the other night and were impressed.  It's a casual, seat yourself, neighborhood pizza joint.  We had fantastic service and the food is really good.  To start they give you some delicious and buttery bread that was an unexpected treat.  The cheesesteak pizza was awesome.  We really enjoyed our food and experience and will be back!"}
{"text":"Definitely NOT New York pizza.  Dough is too thick and the sauce is bland.  The Wedding soup was also not authentic and very bland.  On a better note, the staff was pleasant."}
{"text":"We have had them deliver twice, both times ordering the same pizza. We got the house special (a supreme type topped pizza) both times.

 I asked for it to be on thin crust the first delivery,  but received it on a thicker crust. The girl who wrote down my order, wrote my address down wrong, and I didn't hear them call me multiple times to get the correct address for over 40 minutes,. So the pizza was pretty old by the time we got it, but it was still warm and really good. I had been craving a thin and crispy crust, but I was still very pleased. The toppings were good, the cheese was tasty, but the sauce wasn't my favorite.

The next time,  I made it a bit more clear that I wanted thin and crispy crust to make sure I got it. We got a square cut (my fav for thin crusts) pizza full of toppings. Sadly,  I liked the regular crust better. The thin had very little flavor, and got mushy with the sauce after a bit. Bleh.

It was really good cold the next day though. 

I will probably order again,  as I am having a hard time finding something better. 

Oh, the bread sticks left a bit to be desired.  The sauce had no flavor and neither did the sticks, won't order those again."}
{"text":"Meatballs are horrible, obviously frozen, pasta was like mush. Is this what the serve on the streets of ny, I think not."}
{"text":"We've eaten here many times since Streets opened at this Happy Valley location and we have never been disappointed. The food always meets our expectations. The traditional crust pizza and salads are our favorites. Great prices for appetizers and drinks during happy hour!"}
{"text":"We were given bread and sauce then ordered lasagna and the toscana.  This was for a business dinner.  The person I met with seemed to enjoy the lasagna and took some home.  He also had a salad.  I loved the toscana and also took some home.  The eggplant and flavor were great.  We also shared a wonderful piece of chocolate cake.  There was quite a variety of options for entrees, desserts, and pizza.  They offer beer and wine.  The server checked on us often and was very friendly.  It was a nice environment, inside and out.  I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Being a world traveler, this was one of the worst meal we experienced. We ordered spaghetti Aioli with a side of meat balls & one spaghetti sausage & peppers. 
Blend, no taste, meatballs tasted like chemical. Garlic bread with absolutely no flavor, basically eating plain dough. Also, had a Pinot noir served room temperature which had a vinegar after taste, had to chill it with ice.
I gave it one star just because of the service.
Save your $$ , as McDonald might serve better food!
Horrible experience, will NEVER go back!"}
{"text":"I had this on 05/26/15. I will keep this basic. The pizza was very large and perfectly baked, the calzone my wife says was average. The ingredients were very good.

As with any pizza and calzone the sauce amount and flavor can make it or break it. 

While I was sitting there waiting for the pizza a couple was there eating at the bar. The wife asked how his calzone was and he said the same thing. He felt it was average and light on sauce.

I felt the actual pizza ingredients were delicious. But, the sauce was light and not much flavor. The true test of a pizza is whether it is good cold as well. All I could taste when it was cold from the refrigerator was the ingredients but not the sauce at all. The cheese was delicious. 

My recommendation is work on the sauce a tiny bit more. Maybe sweeten it up and add more sauce to the pizzas and then you would have a fantastic, awesome pizza on your hands. I would be there every week for something like that.

The calzone needs quite a bit more garlic and sauce in it as I and my wife couldn't really taste much in it.

Thanks for listening."}
{"text":"Last visit was over a year ago and I said I wouldnt go back.  Stopped in Friday as a last resort and was pleasantly surprised.  We just had a regular pepperoni pizza and some wings.  They must have changed something with their pizza because I don't remember it tasting that good.  The wings were excellent and perfectly cooked.  Also you can't beat a 25oz Blue Moon for $5.50.  we'll be back."}
{"text":"Pizza was fantastic. Lasagna was less than good. Won't get it again. Salad and pizza a pleasure. Little pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"Perfect service by Jaime, delicious food-we got the xl pizza + 24 wings special deal and the hubby & I got the  $2  25 oz Angry Orchid hard ciders.wow!!  we love this local feel and will be back again!"}
{"text":"This place has massive potential, but definitely needs a little help..

This restaurant is beautiful and spacious. The interior resembles the \"Streets of New York\" including a traditional, New York street lamp, in the middle of the dinning room, and brick accents surrounding the \"Heart of the House\". Beautiful tables and booths all dressed with candle center pieces, and of course, shakers filled with chili flakes and parmesan cheese. 

My son and I came here for lunch and we were excited. With a name like \"Streets of New York Pizza\" who wouldn't be excited to eat a slice? My son ordered the kids, in house made, \"Mac and Cheese\"(refer to pic) which he enjoyed. It came with seasoned fried and a big bowl of mac and cheese.

I ordered a #3 which is \"2 Slices with 1 Topping\"(refer to pic) from the lunch menu. The pizza came out, which i then asked for my usual ranch to accompany my pizza. I ask for ranch just in case the pizza is not flavorful enough. Surprisingly, this pizza did in fact, have LITTLE flavor. Which in my head, was absurd! I'm thinking, \"with a name like Streets of New York Pizza there's NO WAY i'm going to need this ranch!\". I was wrong. The crust was perfect. Nice and crispy, just the way i like it. But the pizza, just wasn't singing, like it should have been. A very big let down.

The tastiest food there was definitely the complementary \"Garlic Bread and Warm Marinara\"(refer to pic). Woo Wee!! This stuff was awesome! The bread was sooo fluffy and flavorful, and The marinara was DELICIOUS! I would come back just for that.

The one thing i wouldn't come back for would be the service.The service here was just, eh.. I told the waitress that we have never been here before, and she gave us nothing. I asked her what they were famous for, or what was their specialty and again, nothing. I even went as far as to inform her that this location was not on Yelp and i would be adding them today, still nothing. Towards the end of my meal, i glanced behind my shoulder to find 3 of the employees, sitting at the bar stools, eating and watching TV. Crazy right? I was trying to get my servers attention so i could pack my sons food up but it was apparent that she was a little busy watching TV.  Decent prices, decent food. 3 stars for now."}
{"text":"Food wss great! We an on going back. Just not a five star because its a pizza place atmosphere."}
{"text":"This was my 3rd choice for lunch yesterday with my coworkers and I'm really glad we ended up going here! I hadn't heard any fantastic about this place, but nothing horrible either. 

I had the lunch special with 1/2 sandwich and salad for around $7.00. I got the #7 sandwich which has three different Italian meats, cheese, lettuce, tomato, peppercinis, and a oil type sauce. It was awesome! The bread was toasted and the perfect combination of crunchy and soft. The Caesar was pretty standard, but tasty none the less. 

This place is close to work and I'm sure we'll be back sometime soon."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. I've been coming here since late 2009.  The pizzas were amazing back then.  The crusts were crispy but had the right amount of chewiness, combined with the superb toppings and sweet tang of the pizza sauce made everything better. I used to beg my fiance to have pizza there.  Now. . .not so much.  Something is off with their pizzas and I keep ordering them thinking they are going to taste amazing again. Every time in recent history I have been disappointed.  One time I told the waitress that our pizza was soggy and the dough was still raw and she told me I should have ordered it well done. Um. . .okay, thanks.  A couple times the toppings have been unrecognizable.   The other times the pizzas tastes couldn't rival a pizza ordered in (not good bc I could have easily called in a pizza order to pizza hut, paid less, and enjoyed it more).  I love the pizzeria feel of the place, but I can't put up with declining food for ambiance.  I really do want to love this place again, but right now I'm going to stop coming in. I'm sure they won't miss my $34.50 (yeah that's what we paid for a large pizza, two coors, and a coke), but it shouldn't be about that. This place could be amazing if they just tweek it a little."}
{"text":"Brought the family for dinner and received friendly service. No wait line to eat. We took longer to decide what to eat than the food did to come out and it was delicious. They were accommodating on splitting our 18\" pizza with a couple slices worth for our picky eater to only have cheese. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty good, albeit kind of expensive at $20 for a 16\" pie. And to be clear, it does not taste like pizza from NY but is is made in the \"style.\" I love the minestrone soup...they serve it covered in chunks of garlic bread and mozzarella. The staff is friendly and service is usually prompt. If it wasn't as expensive I'd rate it as 4 stars. Don't get the spinach dip, it tastes like mayo in a bad way."}
{"text":"Great place for pizza, pasta and appetizers! The service was awesome especially for our large party. Our pizza was cooked to perfection! The restaurant does need a decor update, but if you can look past that you'll be fine!"}
{"text":"I stopped by this evening by myself and loved it! I just took a seat at the bar because I was by myself, and Cory the bartender made me feel at home immediately. The service was great! I had a bowl of wedding soup that was sprinkled all around with Parmesan cheese. Delicious! The hot wings that followed were wonderful as well. A couple came in and ordered pizza. It looked really good, too, so I can't wait to go back and try that. I struck up a nice conversation with that couple, too. All in all, it was a very pleasant evening. I think I found a new favorite hangout! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"So far so good. I come here for my antipasto salad. I can always tell when there is a different chef preparing it. But always happy with the outcome. Looks like they may be under new management not too sure. But what I did notice is the lunch salad seems smaller than before. It has been plated in a smaller bowl. Just thought I would throw that in. Other than that some good salad and a few passion bread bites and I am happy."}
{"text":"We rotate pizza places each Friday and this joint didn't disappoint! They added the Gorgonzola to my white pizza, the beer cheese was UH-mazing.... the pepperoni pizza was SO good! This place made our pizza Friday exceptional :)"}
{"text":"Looking to go out instead of ordering a pizza in? Streets of New York has awesome pizza and other Italian dishes as well. The pizza is deep dish and TASTY. It's been reliably good over the years, and continues to offer cuisine that both pleases me and my boyfriend. Not an easy task! It's also great place to hang out with friends when everyone has different tastes because who doesn't like pizza? This location is my favorite in the area because it is bigger, more open, has TV's, and yet still maintains a nice restaurant feel as opposed to manly bar feel. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"So, after my exchange with Rick the other day thought I'd give them a try again - this time opted out of pizza all together and went for another menu item.

Chicken Pesto Penne - it was delicious! As restaurants like to do with pasta, there was way to much on the plate, more than anyone should eat in one sitting. I ate some of the pasta, all of the chicken, and saved the rest of the pasta for lunch this afternoon.

The hubs (still on his carb-free diet) had the Italian Sausage with cheese, without marinara sauce. He said it was really good.

The wait staff on the floor last night was quite young. Our waitress was nice enough but really needs some additional training. She'd ask a question and walk away before we were finished answering it - one of those times, if she had listened, she would have realized that I wanted bread to come with my meal.
Not her fault, we aren't born with customer service skills. We need to be taught them from the folks senior to us. At least the food didn't sit under the heat lamp or anything 'drastic'.

This was the first time we ate indoors. I will say that the \"windows\" on the kitchen side of the seating area is adorable. Bricks on the kitchen wall, so that it kind of looks like you're sitting inside looking out on the streets of NY. Very cute.

I'm giving them 4 stars - and don't see them going above that. Here's why, so that my new friend, Rick, knows. This place is seen as a pizza place, the name says it - the front of the menu says it - the first word in their 3 word description says it (Pizza, Pasta, Subs). For a pizza place to be 5 stars, the pizza should knock my socks off, and the rest should be icing on the cake!"}
{"text":"Ordered from here yesterday and the food was amazing and filling, great prices and great food, i liked it!"}
{"text":"When the delivery driver came back with the pizza, he told us that the pizza he had grabbed was the one the chef was eating while making our pizza... Not sure if that's supposed to be comforting?

Another update as well, I don't know if it is the owner or what but I have been harassed now several times for posting this review. Not good business practice!"}
{"text":"Mis managed.  Order a salad and other items for take out.  Got there salad not in order.  Was added got home was not what was ordered.  Called and was told they don't make it anymore but would be happy to refund money.  Stay away."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza and wings here, We have been going here for years and they used to deliver to us when we were closer by.  Even the delivery guy knows me pretty well.  They now have gluten free pizza that tastes pretty good and that makes my wife and son happy.  I like the honey BBQ chicken wings and service is pretty good here also.  Casual atmosphere, few TV's with a game on, and even a few seats outside."}
{"text":"I like the location. Neat little area in centennial.  Pizza was very good as well as our salad. Service was a little slow for not being busy. Lots of tv's with sports."}
{"text":"Been to this location a couple of times, and the staff always look like they hate their lives, and it reflects on the service. Both of our servers were like zombies with no personality whatsoever. The food quality is about the same as other locations, both times it took longer than I would expect to get our food, but always tasted good. Someone just needs to wake up the staff so it doesn't feel like an old folks home in there.


Update: Our waitress was SO SLOW. She would \"stroll\" over to our table and then \"stroll\" away and ignore us for 15 mins at a time. I had to remind her 3 times for 1 refill, and when it was time for the check, she practically threw it on the table, and didn't leave a pen. We had to ask another person there for one. Horrible service. HORRIBLE. HORRIBLE. HORRIBLE. Not returning to this location."}
{"text":"Excellent thin crust sausage, mushroom and onion pizza. Spinach salad with basalmic vinaigrette, a delicious side."}
{"text":"The name is deceiving, not anything at all like NY style pizza, not even close! Was hoping to get pizza like back home and was disappointed to say the least. The wings were good. The pizza was very doughy, not thin, dough was definitely not handmade. It tasted pre-made. It was very salty, not enough cheese, too much spice in sauce, and even more dry seasonings sprinkled on top, which is totally not necessary. If you're not used to East Coast style pizza then this place would probably be acceptable. Won't eat there again."}
{"text":"Phone number and address is for the NW location that's 30mins away but on the maps it the correct place. 
Found out after I came to pick up my order
Had to order again. Good job on the accuracy Yelp!"}
{"text":"Pizza is made on a conveyor belt oven, not a traditional pizza oven. Dough is made different, tastes different, and has a different texture . Sauce and cheese is OK, but they destroy the pizza by placing oregano on it. Only Greeks and Mexicans place oregano on pizza. Definitely not a New York Neopolitan style pizza! If pizza was made like this in the REAL STREETS OF NEW YORK, they wouldn't last a week! The only thing I can compare this pizza to is Lil Caesars. So, if you like that type of pizza, it's the place for you. If you're from New York and know what NY pizza is don't waste your time."}
{"text":"I love the pizza here (the DBacks Triple Play is awesome), but it's amazing that they get my order wrong EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. As long as you don't modify a pizza in any way, you should be fine. The food is delicious, but there is no communication or quality assurance between those taking the order and those making the pizza."}
{"text":"I've only ever been here for lunch during the work week and they're never really that busy, but the service is always slow and sporadic. Our group got our meals like 20 minutes apart and most of us had salads. The server made a snarky comment to one of us when she forgot who ordered what dish and we corrected her. She also never came around after we got our food and refilled our water. 

All in all, service was meh, food was ok. The pizza and breadsticks are good, but the salad is always drowning in dressing and soggy."}
{"text":"I did not like this place.  Didn't live up to any of the pictures on here.  For me wings need to have a nice crisp to them, but that's me, these were just too wet. The PT's across the street where I live makes much better wings.  SKIP the Hot honey or whatever sauce, Heat level was nice, but just not great tasting.  I ordered the new York combo pizza, or whatever its called, their main one.  Nothing great to really say, it was a little soggy. tasted ok I guess, but not worth its cost."}
{"text":"Ordered a house salad that actually came with a variety of fresh vegetables which was very refreshing. Had a few wingS as well. The wings were delicious! I will have to come by again to try the pizza."}
{"text":"Always great service in the store and for delivery! Very friendly staff and amazing food! Always love the pizza but the subs, salad, and pasta are always delicious too! Great variety to make everyone happy! And where else can you get great pizza by the slice? Highly recommend the  New York combo!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered all the happy hour tasty bites and a Meatball sub. The food was amazing!  All very fresh. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Really great pizza, and trivia to boot! The pizza crust is thin, just the way I like it being from New England. The only issue I had was service was a bit slow and drink refills were a challenge. The employees were polite and pleasant though, and the trivia DJ was funny. Went with several friends and we all enjoyed it. It's located in a cute \"village-like\" area. We'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out for Music Bingo on a Monday night. The shopping center where it is located is different than anywhere else in Vegas. This one street is designed like a small town street... it was really cool to walk around. The restaurant inside continues that small town charm. We ordered a 14 inch pepperoni, a pepperoni calzone, and the pesto mozzarella crostini. The food was excellent, but service leaves something to be desired. They were not busy, but they seemed lost. It took over 30 minutes to get my appetizer, but at least it was worth the wait. He seemed to have forgotten about it because when I asked about it, he didn't remember what we had ordered. The pizza took awhile but we knew that and expected it. My kids usually only eat one piece, but they each devoured 2 whole pieces. Definitely will return for music.bingo and the crostini. That thing was a piece of heaven..."}
{"text":"This location has issues.We have ordered from this company's other locations without issue. Tonight's order is the 3rd order in a row that the team has messed up. 

We called to let them know that the order was incorrect. The wrong item was sent. They tried to make good and messed up the fix for the error by sending the wrong item. 

It's too bad that this branch is experiencing issues. The food is tastey. We will be finding a new place to order from for movie night."}
{"text":"Ordered their pizza and the price is insanely high for what you get. For $36 got two personalized pizzas. It wasn't that great anyway. Do yourself a favor and save the money and go get two $5 store freezer pizzas if you want something comparable."}
{"text":"Barely edible. I've had their sandwiches and their pasta dishes. I've felt like my money was wasted every time. I won't be eating there again."}
{"text":"When this place first opened, I loved it. It was one of my favorite places to have pizza. Unfortunately I moved out of their delivery range, but recently I wanted to give it a shot via a third party delivery service. To be honest, the pizza came cold, which I will commend the place on making right by giving me a credit on my account, but the pizza was so horrible tasting that it left a bad taste in both my and my boyfriends mouth. What happened?!"}
{"text":"Im doing three starts for this place, not because the service (which was great the first time, but eh this past time), but mainly the food.

First time I went to this location, the food was so great.  I had ordered some baked ziti and enough to feed a small army. The taste was tremendous and I had leftovers for days (not really, but I dont want to sound like a pig).  The bread they brought out before hand was fresh and the drinks were perfect.

This last time...

We sat down and waited a while before the waitress came over.  After getting our drinks (good), she brought us some, what seemed like day old bread and luke warm marinara sauce.  My girlfriend ordered a sandwich and I ordered a calzone.  Im a big fan of calzones and have loved them.. well not this time.  It was pretty tasteless to be honest with you.  You would think a ton of cheese with sausage and mushroom would be good right? Nope.. I had to add salt to even flavor it up some.  I only ate about half.  Pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"Hubby and I decided to go to the actual restaurant, instead of ordering delivery.  We were in the mood for Italian food, and just felt like going out.  We arrived sort of late on a Tuesday night, so it wasn't very crowded, but there were a few people eating at the counter.  We sat at a table, and were immediately greeted by a friendly waitress.

I ordered chicken parmesan with angel hair pasta and a caesar salad to start.  Hubby ordered the ravioli and a cup of chicken tortilla soup to start.  First they brought us their passion bread, which was warm and soft and deliciously garlicky.  It's served with a side of marinara for dipping.  A few minutes later our soup and salad arrived.  Hubby loved the soup and I enjoyed my salad. It wasn't overdressed, and the parmesan cheese shavings were a real nice touch.

After our starters, we received our entrees...my chicken parm was absolutely perfect!  The chicken was hot and tender, with the right amount of cheese on top.  And, the angel hair pasta was really good and provided a lovely pillow for the chicken.  Hubby loved his ravioli, and actually used a final piece of passion bread to sop up the leftover sauce on his plate.

For dessert, we shared a piece of very, very rich chocolate cake...it was moist and incredibly decadent.

Overall, our inhouse dining experience was wonderful.  We will still order delivery, but every now and then, we'll make a short trip to the restaurant to have a very delightful dinner."}
{"text":"Pizza cookie is to die for! Could not get through on phone line to order takeout.  Ended up eating in.  Servers were pleasant and good with the kids.  Would be five stars had we been able to take out and call ahead."}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place. Pizza was pretty basic. Ravioli was not very good. Not many pizza places in this area, but I would go to Sauce instead."}
{"text":"First time here, waitress was nice and on top of things. We ordered combo pizza and wings. Pizza was delicious and crisp not soggy I hate soggy pizza... We had the medium wings... Nice and crunchy very flavorful... We will be back next time I want to try a hot sub. I also ordered a cheesecake and before doing so i asked if it was in house made its not but it's delicious nice and rich... Big slice too."}
{"text":"I've been craving spaghetti for like a week and I remembered this place was down the street from my house. Portions were huge, staff was nice, and I've found an establishment that serves good spaghetti. Will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Getting progressively worse! If I could've given them 0 stars, I would have. Quality has went way down, presentation looks like something you pay $5 for at a fast food drive-thru. I'm pretty sure the girl that takes the phone orders is a pothead or something because she's retarded. The last 5 times I ordered from there they forgot my dressing and bread on 4 out of the 5 orders. They don't even get the standard toppings right on the pizzas, so if you want something extra, forget about it. When they screw up and you call and complain they tell you that you'll get a discount on your next order, when you decide to order again they have no record of the discount that you're supposed to receive. Get a hot n' ready instead and save $50, at least you know what you're going to get."}
{"text":"I am sorry for the first reviewer, but we did have a very good experience in our first visit here. Actually the best pizza we had had in years. Service was fine too. Another time we had them deliver pizza and this was good too, and on time. I would recommend them for pizza to anybody in Anthem."}
{"text":"I ordered the \"Lasagna \" which consisted of one layer of noodles swimming in soupy tomato sauce with a few pieces of meat thrown in. Dreadful. Overpriced and not worth a return visit.  If you want real Italian,  go to La Piazza instead."}
{"text":"I've been in this area a couple months.  This is my favorite pizza joint for sure.  Cedar salad 5 stars,  margarita pizza 4 stars (the crust was perfect!), ny style combo pizza 4 stars, beer,  well served. Service by Martha 5 stars!  Nice music,  tvs, and a small bar.  I'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"If you are coming to watch \"the game\", skip it. They have a few small tvs, but instead of having the sound on, they play a radio station. I went yesterday and it was a ghost town. The waitress was actually sitting at the bar eating bread and it appeared drinking a pint. After a while it was only us remaining. It was so quiet I almost forgot the game was on."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge pizza fanatic, but this location was my go to on pizza nights. I was sad to drive by and see they were replaced by a sub shop! :-("}
{"text":"I'm seeing a lot of bad reviews... But I love Streets of New York. The only weird thing about this location is that they have candles on the table which the pizza is usually sitting over (I think they are supposed to keep the food warm)... But none of them were lit, even ours as he set the pizza down. Ah well, it's the only pizza I ever crave and since they shut down the location close to me, I'll be back."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a while & now I know why.... The service was terrible - I waited over 5 minutes for a menu &  I had to ask for silverware! Their \"Passion Bread\" is pizza dough - the cheese garlic bread is on sesame seed sandwich rolls & not garlicky at all. The spaghetti Bolognese was meh! Boring, the spaghetti under cooked, no real flavor, I won't be going back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza.  Alright price.  

The pizza has a garlic flavor to it in the crust, which we do not mind.  We're garlic heads.  I always ask for some hot wing sauce on the side for dipping.  The first time I did, I was expecting to pay for it like I do (and you have to pay for everything) at Gus'.  But they just gave it to me, a decent sized container, for free. 

I like the fact that at this location, there's a drive-through for phone orders.  I can all in my order ahead of time and then drive over, pay for, and pick up our eats without leaving my vehicle!"}
{"text":"Have been trying to get to this place for a while and finally got there. I ordered ahead for a 4 piece broasted chicken meal  chicken is a little salty but I'd rather have that than old icky tasting oil. A little more spendy compared to other chicken joints but rather have that than dry. Ample parking and staff is friendly. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming to this restaurant.  The food is tasty and the service is consistently good!

This visit found me in my favorite seat, but I soon realized it was too close to the kitchen because the music playing overhead was just as loud as the music coming from the kitchen. It's disorienting to be listening to two songs at the same time when you're trying to have a quiet meal, even though the food was very good!


- - - - - - - - - - - 

I love to come here for lunch but I almost sat outside because the radio in the kitchen was louder than the overhead music again.  It was disturbing from all the way across the restaurant.    I just knock down my review by a couple of stars.  I am starting to avoid the place just because of the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a couple years and love coming here. My food is never wrong, always have great service and also like it that my favorite server Jennifer is still there! She knows what I like and what my usuals are. Never are they busy enough to where you get ignored even at lunch time. Small little bar counter that you can watch football (oh yeah I love football!!!woot woot) or something dumb. Hahaha.  Gourmet pizzas are pretty good too. Love the BBQ chicken one minus mushrooms of course. Its the bomb on thin crust. All in all good place to go for lunch for sure."}
{"text":"Visit on 10/27/12 - I have lived in the area for a while and finally decided to stop in for lunch. I am now kicking myself for taking so long to eat here. My girlfriend and I both had the featured lunch special. 1 slice of pizza & 6 wings for $6.99. I ordered the pepperoni pizza & honey hot wings.

The wings are the best I have had in Las Vegas. Far superior than any of the other pizza places and BBW. The sauce was delicious!  The pizza was some of the best I have had in Las Vegas as well. Very good!!!

The service was good as well, Emily our waitress was very attentive. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I thought this place was pretty good. I kind of suck when it comes to reviewing pizza...I love anything dough-y that has cheese and sauce on it.  It's a bit pricey (18\" pie was about $24.00). We got olives and pineapple on it and I have no complaints. 

The guy running the place was very friendly as well! That always adds a star in my book. I'll go back on my next trip to Phoenix."}
{"text":"When I want and awesome dinner out this is the only place to go. Love our waitress Cheyenne! Great gluten free pizza and having some laughs with the family! Casual and fun restaurant to bring kids and large families for good times and awesome food!"}
{"text":"They have good food. Been eating here since I moved down 10 years ago. I like their toasted subs and the pizza is excellant! My husband likes the wings and bread knots. Happy Hour is also a bonus.

 They are Phoenix Suns sponsors and host the Gorillla during the season. My kids loved eating thier gluten free pizza and meeting the famous Suns Gorilla! Very relaxed family friendly atmosphere. Always welocoming you with a smile when you enter."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. But I recently order delivery for my house. I order a pizza, a sandwich with fries and dessert. 
The pizza tastes like garlic bread and the sandwich was loaded with lettuce and hardly any meat in sight. I got a total of a dozen fries with the sandwich in the bag they gave me. And I order a pazooki cookie that comes with vanilla bean ice cream. The cookie was good but the ice cream was a tablespoon. Awful. Will never go again. I didn't need to pay $46 for crap."}
{"text":"The post-hike dinner has been a personal tradition. After my hiking trail adventure ends, my dining adventure begins. Today, after hiking up in the Sawmill trails of the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area, I set out for the Streets of New York. It was a logical choice. I am a New York transplant that loves his pizza and subs. 

   It took work to find the Streets of New York on account of the fact that the streets of northwest Las Vegas are so confusing in the vicinity of the US 95 and the 215 exits. Streets of New York is located in a pedestrianised street that looks like Town Square. In similar style to Town Square, customers can park on the Main Street or in a parking lot at the back of the building. 

   Streets of New York is a casual sit down restaurant with extended booths and tables where televisions showing professional sports provide entertainment. When I walked into the restaurant, the host and waitress invited me to sit anywhere. I'd chose a long booth. After hiking, I appreciated the comfort of the plush booth. 

   Now for the menu. I was hoping that they offered my favorite sandwich, which is an eggplant parmesan on toasted bread that the pizzerias on my streets of New York offer without fail. But not these Streets of New York. The menu features New York pizza where their customers have a variety of choices and sizes in pies and slices, sandwiches including pastrami, and the meatball parmesan sub. What truly reached from the Streets of New York to the heart of my soul was their broaster chicken. This is where I was aware I was on the streets to a rewarding dining adventure. 

  It was only recently that Chilly Jilly'z at the other end of the continent Boulder City turned me into a fan of broaster chicken. When I set eyes on Streets of New Yorks special menu of broaster chicken, my mind was set on the two piece white meat broaster chicken meal. It included a chicken breast and wing, a 4 ounce side that I picked coleslaw and two potato wedges. It was also supposed to include bread that they never gave me. Oh well! The food was so filling and tasty that I had forgot all about the bread. The chicken breast was a large portion where the chicken wing was sufficient. The two potato wedges were large. Regardless that the potato wedges tasted fine they fell short of Chilly Jilly'z, that up to the time of this review is the best that I ever had. The cole slaw was a nice size portion and tasted average. All this food wasn't bad for $6.25 before tax. But, I have to have a fountain drink with my dinner. Especially a post-hike dinner. The Cokes, that didn't have a dint of flatness and that the waitress refilled in a timely manner brought the dinner up to nearly $10 before the tip. 

  After my leading dining adventure at Streets of New York, there is still more adventure that awaits. I truly want to try their New York pizza. Maybe this is first-rate New York pizza. My dilemma is that there are miles of streets of Las Vegas to reach Streets of New York. However, sometime in the future I am leaning toward a dining adventure in their Spring Valley location to explore their New York pizza."}
{"text":"I ordered the New York Cheesesteak and the Broaster Chicken.  Quite honestly the best chicken in Vegas.  Beats out Popeye's by a mile.  The cheesesteak was outstanding. The pizza was great as always.  The meats used on everything, from the pizza to the wings to the sandwiches were amazing.  This is a great hangout!  The server was attentive and was on top of the drinks for the table and the pitcher of beer!  

I came on a Sunday and they had a couple of NFL games on and had sound!  Great Sunday spot!  I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this new pizza place out since it's so close to my office. The menu is pretty standard. Pizza, pasta, subs, and other similar items. There are lunch specials, which is what I like to see. The lunch specials are available 10:30 am to 4:00 pm.

I went with the six wings with a slice lunch special. For $6.95, you get six wings and a large slice of cheese pizza. If you want toppings on your slice, it's an extra .50 each. The portion is perfect for lunch.

The service was attentive and friendly. Prices are good. Another place I'm adding to my lunch rotation."}
{"text":"The lunch menu is very reasonably priced and the service has been fantastic. The restroom was super clean and as a mom with a little one, I was so happy with the changing station in the restroom as well. The details mean a lot when you're looking for a good family friendly place to eat some really good food and possibly watch a game and stay close to home."}
{"text":"good food and nice environment but some of the staff is very mean and boring and act like they can't stand their jobs. my family and I were served by this younger girl one night (I don't remember her name) and she did not smile once at us, she did not make us feel welcomed. she made us feel like we made her night he worst night she's ever lived. that's how it felt. and it's not the first time we've gone and felt like the staff was unhappy. on the happier note though, I got a cheese pizza with tomatoes and it was DELICIOUS. I actually had ordered a regular cheese and pepperoni pizza and the girl who hated her life got my order wrong and gave me the tomato, but when I tried it I actually really loved it so I'm not even upset about that one. just wish we would've felt more welcomed into the place."}
{"text":"Sterling is the server to ask for.   Great pizza !   If  you are in the northwest las vegas stop here.  

A great taste of New York in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Yum! A Relaxed Sunday lunch with plenty of TVs and NFL Sunday Ticket. Service was excellent. Thanks Shelby! Our group had the New York combo pizza on original crust, BBQ Chicken pizza and broasted chicken. The combo pizza had plenty of everything as well as three colors of bell peppers not just green, the sausage was juicy and the crust - oh the crust! Fluffy edges yet crispy on the bottom. Breasted chicken from my childhood memories was something I thought I'd never have again but I was wrong - seasoned to perfection and steaming hot. To top everything off, I asked for a To-go cup for my diet coke and received a large fresh cup for the ride home. Everything was great - we will definitely be back. Thanks SoNY!"}
{"text":"When they first opened it was a welcome addition to this side of town but has progressively gone down in quality in service. While we would go regularly and bring friends, each progressive visit has been more lackluster.

Wanted a sandwich tonight and usually can't go wrong even as a pickup .  Unfortunately, both orders were wrong despite having no business at the time - no cheese or dressing on the Caprese sandwich and onion and tomatoes on the ham when requested not to have them.  Very disappointing for something so simple."}
{"text":"We bought a groupon ($15 for $30 worth of food) and headed there today to catch the lunch specials. We both had the 6 wings and a slice of pizza for about $6-7 each. We also got the slice and salad which brought our total to $27 including 2 drinks. The wings were GREAT with lots of meat (hot/BBQ). Salad was also good and came with an orange bell pepper slice. Overall the food was great and for only $15 + tip thx to groupon. We WILL be back."}
{"text":"Came in last night looking for Pizza and wings.  A lil disappointed.  Ordered wings hot......yea not so much, my 2 year old was able to eat them.....step up your wing game.  Pizza was OK.....service was ok but the waiter was like a cyborg he seemed a lil confused. I was told Streets of New York was some good Pizza, guess I should have listened to my gut and hit up the Mellow Mushroom."}
{"text":"We've been here twice. Food is decent, but the service is horrible. From the time we sat down it took us about ten minutes to get WATER. After we ordered, it took 30 minutes for our SALAD to arrive. Yes, lettuce in a bowl took 30 minutes. Both times it was not busy, half full dinning room or less. If you have all day and you aren't very hungry, the food is decent, but if you'd like to enjoy yourself with out the pause of, \"where the hell is ____\", and \"how long ago did we ______\",  go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I have to give atleast one star? No zero stars huh? 

So last night my family got together to watch the Cardinals Monday Night Football game and to eat some pizza. We decided to have delivery to my Dad's house which is off the grid of every other pizza place delivery zones. SO, Streets of New York delivers to my dad's house. 

After ordering 2 large pizzas and some wings- Total 60 BUCKS not including tip. 

The gal told us it wont be more than an hour to receive the pizzas. We are maybe 3 miles from them by the way.  OK, its monday night football- understandable. 

59 Minutes later exactly the door bell rings- we start heckling the delivery guy a little about being \"on time\" he then proceeds to tell us sorry and that he is the only driver on duty tonight. huh? I know its preseason but still its our team on MNF!

Whatever- we are starving at this point. We open up the pizza and wow- that it? The pizza is cold, very little toppings and the wings are soggy and not very flavorful at all! For 60 bucks!!

We will never go back and will make the drive ourselves to go pick up the pizza at Barro's Pizza."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of their thin crust pizza. One of the things I love about this specific location is that it's quiet. I've never seen it super busy. This place has the vibe of a family run business and I feel like family when I come in. The servers are sweet, food is good. The location is great. Streets of New York is my go-to spot."}
{"text":"We love this location! Samantha is a great server!
She's fast, friendly and always is smiling no matter how busy it is.
We usually get a bottle of wine and 2 slices! 
Always excellent!"}
{"text":"Wish I didn't have to give 1 star. Waited 40 minutes after time stated, pizza had to be heated up, street fries had to be thrown away. $42 for a meal I had to heat up half and throw away the other. Pizza was mediocre at best. One of my worst delivery experiences to date. Will never order again."}
{"text":"Do not waste your pizza calories here. There is absolutely nothing special about the pizza. It's not cheap; it's not tasty. The server was positively surly when we came for lunch. I've had better pizza and better service at Costco. And it was WAY cheaper."}
{"text":"I call Streets of New York because i have always recieved quality service and a very good pizza. Tonight i was completly let down, for $22.00 plus a tip i got a cold pizza ina damaged box when i opened the box i felt like ive been screwed. Why is it people just dont care about their customers anymore. Too bad !"}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch one day before heading back to work. I have seen this place around but never stopped in to try. I had a lunch special which was just 2 slices of pizza. My server was very friendly and checked up on me every once in awhile. The bread they brought out before the meal was a little stale, but I did enjoy the pizza. I've heard good things so I'd probably give them another try."}
{"text":"I haven't even gotten my food yet and I don't even care. 
We walked in and we sat ourselves us being the only people in the entire store.. oh and somebody at the bar. Someone got our drinks then we waited.. waited.. and waited for our waitress that the busser told us that would come by. Our menus are closed in front of us so I figured that was the sign for \"were ready\".. 
The waitress is chatting with somebody at the bar which is fine, probably taking their order. The busser asks if he could start something for us, i let him know we were ready to order.. he went back to tell the server.. So the busser or whoever came back after a few minutes and asked if he could relay the message back to the waitress of what we wanted. Ok sure. 
So he walks to her and tells our order to her, which I thought was weird because it wasn't busy. We were the only table. I guess since I'm a server I expected something different.. won't be back."}
{"text":"We just had our 3rd delivery of broaster chicken, and 2/3 orders have been delivered incorrectly.  We love that we can order something other than pizza delivered to our door when we don't feel like cooking.  The broaster chicken is good, and we love the passion bread that comes with the family meal.  Which is what has come up missing, amongst other things, both times.  

When we called tonight (we didn't call before because we chalked it up to a fluke because the gal that took our order seemed very new and confused) to ask them to fix the mistake, and were met with indifference and 'surprise?' that we wanted them to send another driver out with the bread (and correct salad dressing).  No apology, and a \"you want us to bring the bread out to you TONIGHT?\".  

This just irritates me.  I love shopping and spending locally, and I really want to include this restaurant as a welcome change for ordering in.  As I have stated in other reviews, customer service is dead."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots for pizza in Vegas. The restraunt is a casual family friendly place with a dark wood interior. There are TVs tuned into sports for watching the game. It is set in a cute but struggling shopping street made to look like a neighborhood.

The pizza is the some of the best I've had in vegas. The crust is just right. Not too thick and not too thin. The toppings are fresh and the cheese is flavorful. The only time I have had a complaint was when I ordered a piece of pizza by the slice. It was obviously a piece that had been sitting around and was reheated, not so good. SO I would not reccomend ordering pizza by the slice. 

The salads here are fantastic. I love the greek salad. Lots of fresh romaine with green, red and yellow peppers, cucumbers,tomatoes and kalamata olives with feta cheese with a tasty greek dressing.

The one drawback to this place is the service. The waitresses are not very friendly and the service is slow. Even with that drawback, this is still our go to place for good pizza."}
{"text":"The service is wonderful, the staff is so personable. The food is always great. This has become our favorite dining out place. We also do carry out and have never been disappointed with delivery and product. Try it! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The waiters are the best..3 separate helped us...had a very good pizza...Philly steak was dry...the garlic knots very good"}
{"text":"Everything here is just ok. Came in right as the lunch rush started, with only one server... And he was trying his best doing rounds and being as attentive as possible. Food was mediocre at best. Seemed like run of the mill ingredients and bread. The pizza crust was was good and fluffy with a bit of bite, so that was good. But the sandwich was boring, I felt like subway was doing more exciting things than them, and I ordered the number one, their signature or something. Again my server was doing his best and treated us well, he could have used some help but the woman behind the counter wasn't stepping up to the plate to help out. Kitchen kept banging food out without issues, my food was correct, as was my son's, and I didn't see anyone's plate get sent back. I think of they used better ingredients, and (now I'm just speculating) a fresh bread from a local bakery their sandwich would've have need amazing. I can see myself coming back for beer and a slice because it's still better than most restaurants in this neighborhood."}
{"text":"Ordered carry out penne with creamy marinara sauce opened up and could not find the creamy marinara sauce,  I could see the penne is slightly coated.  Looked at the bottom of container barely any sauce.  Really?  So sad. I was raised I an Italian neighborhood.  This is the worst excuse for Italian food ever."}
{"text":"We come here for the pizza and wings. We live about 25 miles away and would love one closer but it's worth the drive. Staff is nice and we've never had a bad experience here. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is sorry.  I work about 1.5 miles away, one exit up the hwy, from this location. And they tell me they \"Don't deliver that far away\"  LOL  A mile and a half?  Pathetic. A LOT of  workers here who like to order food. This place needs to take some advice from Tortas Chano, and Barros pizza..both of whom DO deliver a mile and a half away."}
{"text":"Table was filthy when we sat down, however the waitress never offered to clean.  We ordered chicken and pizza which took forever (25 min).  We were then offered garlic knots for apology for the wait.  However all is well that ends well, food was delicious.  Pizza was good and chicken was hot and tender."}
{"text":"Anchovies!

I adore anchovy on pizza, and it's relatively hard to get here. SoNY has anchovies. They also have kalamata olives, which is surprisingly upscale for strip mall pizza.

This is where I went after being treated as Ms. Invisible at Red Thai. Here, I got impeccable, good-natured service, plus a thin-crust pizza that was better than my last trip to Fired Pie. (It doesn't hurt that I prefer crispy crust, but the cheese is also a better texture.)

The house wine is surprisingly drinkable (well, come on, no great wine would have had a chance against anchovies). Now I know where to go to satisfy anchovy cravings."}
{"text":"It's not that the pizza is bad or the service is slow (well actually last time I ordered delivery it took over an hour).. It's that the prices are a bit outrageous. 

I ordered a medium pizza and a dozen wings and it was over $40. There are much higher quality spots to drop that kind of skrilla on."}
{"text":"No where close to NY pizza. I am not sure if I would go back. I also placed an order and went to pick it up and I still had to wait another 15 mins. The garlic
Knots are amazing though."}
{"text":"For the third time I have ordered a Cobb salad no cheese, no onions, ranch on the side. For the third time, they've gotten it wrong. 
The first time they left both cheese and onion. I didn't mind, I'm not allergic to dairy, just trying to make better choices. So I ate around the onions and didn't worry.
The second time, they sent an Italian salad, Italian dressing mixed in. I voiced that it was wrong but aye it anyway. 
The third time, they sent the Cobb: no cheese, no onion, ranch on the side, Italian dressing mixed in.

.......

WHAT THE HECK is going on with this salad. It's the only thing they get wrong, but they get it wrong 100% of the time."}
{"text":"I have to say the pizza is good... BUT... The first thing I noticed when I walked in the door was the B rating for the health code - which means they had 14 to 27 violations on their health test - then the waitress sits us down and tells us they have no bread... Which doesn't make sense considering the have ovens and other stuff and they should be able to make damn bread. We order and about 20 minutes later we see our food on the counter, it then sits there for about five minutes until the waitress realizes it was there. When she brings over the food, she had forgotten about one of our orders and had to order it on the spot. 1 worker in the entire restaurant during lunch rush... Come on. Anyways pizza was actually really good, and so was the roast beef. I suggest the food but the rest was pretty bad. May come back"}
{"text":"I bought the honey hot wings here takeout and they were pretty good.  The wings were nice and big but the honey hot isn't my favorite compared to the others I have tried.  The honey hot flavor was a little strange to me.  Not horrible by any means, just unique.

The service was great - 15 minutes to get the wings on a weekday.  The pricing was around $9.00 for a dozen wings.  I wish they were cheaper but this is pretty typical for wings.

I'm a fan and would love to try their buffalo wings next.  Worth a visit!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've ordered from them. First time the pizza was awesome!!  This time it was very soggy!  Wigs on the other hand where delicious. I also go a slice of cheesecake to go. I paid $.85 for cherries. When I went to dive into my cheesecake the \"cherries\" that they gave me turned out to me ketchup. Gross. I called to tell them and their response was, oh let us give you $.85 to reimburse you for the cherries. What?!!  Ha ha. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"For this review I stopped in for dinner late in the week.  The dining area is accommodating and modern. I had a salad and a combination sausage/meatball bowl from the happy hour menu. The food was promptly served. For some reason I felt rushed even though there was no reason to feel that way.  I usually attribute this to ambiance, personnel, and other factors, but I could not nail it down on this visit.  In the pizza business in particular for which I have 5 years of experience from my early career I tend to be more particular in my objectivity because I look for specifics in the details of the overall operation of the business, such as quality of food, attentiveness of the staff (customer focused), and other details.  I did not have pizza on this visit, so I will wait until I have to rate them higher. Suggest giving them a try, and on the next time around I'll give the pizza a go."}
{"text":"Well we have been ordering from here for a few years. We have had both dine in and delivery on many occasions. When ordering for delivery my normal is their bacon cheese burger and fries. I normally love it but as of late the burger is dry and over cooked. No seasoning seems to be used. The bun is better seems they are using a sturdier bun as it holds up to the condiments. They only put the condiments on one side. I personally like it on both buns as it keep the bun from feeling dry. The fries as well are not seasoned. It  is best to season fries right of the grease so it sticks."}
{"text":"I usually go to Streets of New York after getting frustrated with Leticia's (across the street). The good part is that Streets of New York always seems to turn it around.

The pizza is good. Pizza prices are higher than the delivery chains but better than Rosati's down the street. Try the Italian meatballs appatizer. Get a glass of house wine for $5; $4 before 6. Give them a try."}
{"text":"This place is great! My family and I enjoy ordering pizza and salad and sharing. This place is great for families. Sports team parties .  Date nights too!"}
{"text":"This place has pretty solid pizza with nice crust, but the service absolutely ruins it.  

The staff will flat out forget your order, forget to bring it out, and it's always generally a mess to order carry out.  Somehow they manage to always look frazzled and extremely busy even when there's no one in the place, and no one coming in for carry out.  I don't understand at all.

I'd recommend avoiding this and going across the road to Pizza Re.  Way better food and service."}
{"text":"Just an okay place, with just some ok food & some bad food.  Avoid the meatball sub which is terrible too much bread, salty sauce and not enough meatballs.  Their pear salad is pretty good but not for $12.00.  Their pizza is just okay nothing to write home about.  Overpriced food and bad wait staff not a good fit for a restaurant.  There are much better options for great Pizza in town, like across the street by the gas station."}
{"text":"I love building my own pasta from here.  The pasta is always cooked perfectly.  I wish they had a bow tie pasta pasta (farfalle).  The veggies are fresh and crisp.  My wife loves their farmers market sandwich.

We have had their pizzas and they are really good too.  The toppings seem fresher to me than at other places like sardellas.

Their wings and Four Peaks cheeses appetizers are really good...  they are separate appetizers.. however maybe that would be a good combination.

Another item I would recommend is the cannolis!

Lastly their delivery's seems to be odd at times... I've had my order take 1hr 15min before and then like today it was at my door in 25 min... when we've ordered it has always been around the same time between 5-6Pm.  Here lately the orders have taken between 20-30 min."}
{"text":"I had order for delivery. 

A philly cheese steak with fries and kids chicken tender. Kid's chicken tender was okay.
The worst philly cheese steak I had ever had! It was soggy and there was so much liquid on the bottle of the to go box. They over did it with the cheese. It just didn't sit will with me so I ended up not even eating it. Waste of money."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time with this pathetic location. Called because they were out of basil... ok cool no problem. Eventually order arrives, pasta without the meatballs that were ordered. That's pathetic. How does an Italian restaurant run out of basil, and fail to include meatballs in spaghetti and meatballs?
This place is WAY too expensive to be such a clown show. If you care about having a pleasant ordering experience and getting what you pay for, look elsewhere. I will never order from this location again, and will be hesitant to visit ANY others."}
{"text":"I believe that Streets of New York is a chain, and I've certainly enjoyed my experience at other locations, but this one in particular was a bit of a disaster. The food was all right, but the service was slow and unfriendly. The waiters were borderline anti-social and another guy who seemed to be the owner or at least the manager wasn't much better. 

If you're yearning for Streets of New York Pizza, try another location."}
{"text":"Tonight was a horrid experience with this restaurant.. My wife, two girls and I ordered a 16\" extra cheese pizza and  dozen medium wings. I was quoted 45-60 min. Right around 65 min my food was delivered.... By this time the girls were definitely ready to eat, however, the pizza had obviously been at the bottom of a stack as half of the cheese from the pizza was stuck to the top of the box as I opened it. I have worked in pizza for over 10 years and realize things like this happen. However the wings were totally dry. Absolutely no sauce at all. I have my girls a couple slices of the salvageable pizza and decided to call them to let them know. I was immediately apologized to and told they would remake my order and have it out. Shortly after I receive a call from another associate saying \"who you talked to was like new and stuff\" then proceeded to tell me they would not remake any of my food until the old food was returned to them...!?!?!? I fed some of the pizza to my hungry girls and was told if they ate it it was obviously fine.... I paid $40 plus $10 tip to this place and wish I could get every cent back. They are horrific with customer service and terrible at resolving issues. Shame."}
{"text":"Fresh food. Cold beer. Reasonable prices. GREAT service. We've been here for lunch, happy hour, dinner, and take out. I'm a vegetarian. My husband eats enough animals for both of us. We both leave here satiated with a smile. Becca is our favorite server. She is friendly, genuine, and knowledgable. Mary is also good. The artichoke dip is tasty, creamy and fresh. The pizza is delightful, thin crust leaves more room for beer. We share one w spinach, garlic & sun dried tomatoes. YUM! Not many joints serve pitchers anymore, Streets still does and the price is right. We  will be regulars."}
{"text":"Pizza is a little below average, I think.  The name of the place is certainly misleading. I have lived in NY and in Miami (aka the 6th borough of NY), and this pizza is far from NY style.  It was not bad food.  But it was not great food either.  And the price was very high for what I got.  I called in 30 minutes ahead, had to wait another 10 minutes when I got there.  Servers were friendly enough, but nothing extraordinary.  I will not go back because the pizza was bland and unmentionable ... and expensive."}
{"text":"What happened?
It used to be better, it's just not the same.
I didn't write a review when I took my son there for his birthday, it would have been 1 star, the pizza wasn't thoroughly cooked and the crust was gooey.
5 months later....
Meh. Crust still seemed doughy, not a nice crispness like you'd expect on the bottom.
Except the one slice for the kids meal, that piece was extra crusty and hard. Yum?
They get extra stars because they bring the bread bites to hold us over for the extremely looooong time to get food."}
{"text":"Food was good, portions a little on the small size for the price. Service was excellent. Our server Katie was great!"}
{"text":"Yummy!!!! I used to live down the street from this pizza joint! It is one of the best pizza places I have been to on the west coast! The pizza melts in your mouth!! They use all fresh and quality goods on their pies. The bread sticks are as good as it gets. Whenever I come back to the Phx area I make sure Streets of New York is on my to do list!"}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza and chopped salad for delivery from them via Eat24. Received the pizza within the specified delivery time. The order was wrong - they got one item wrong from the order as entered on Eat24. How hard is it to retype the order from Eat24? Too hard I guess
And the dough was not completely cooked and  definitely not \"NY\" style. I was hungry so I ate the toppings, but they were not completely cooked either. Ick.
Also, the bag, plates and other items they brought had a heavy smell of cigarette smoke, most likely due to the delivery guy smoking while making deliveries. The restaurant refunded the cost of the pizza, which helps a bit. But, I will never order from them or go there again."}
{"text":"Was craving pizza tonight after a long day
SONY was on the bookmark list so decided to try it...
Their pizza has a different taste...
It is good but can't seem to put my finger on the exact taste...
We ordered a half cheese, half pepperoni pizza and it was pretty basic
I was sort of hoping it would be a little bit more... Flavorful. 
I will have to try some of their other specialty pizzas for that :)
 Until next time SONY"}
{"text":"Pizza doesn't thril me, but this Streets of New York is better than most. The ham and pineapple thin crust was close to perfect (but canadian bacon costs twice as much as ham??). It did suffer a bit from \"underdone middle\", like so many thin crusts do. Overall, a pizza I'd eat again.

Along with the pizza, they gave us (and everybody else, apparently) some bread \"chunks\" with marinara. Each was a bite-sized piece of crust, baked and dusted with parmesan (I think). They tasted good, but I wish they had asked if we wanted it, since our basket pretty much went to waste.

The interior is nicely decorated, not too cramped and not too overly filled with pictures and wall objects selected carefully by corporate marketing specialists. The waitress was patient with our inability to decide on a pizza, and she was definitely attentive to our needs throughout the meal."}
{"text":"A year ago I loved ordering from this place always got the calzones and alfredo pasta which sometimes when ordering for delivery I got marinara sauce by mistake twice but it was still good, then this year they seemed to have gotten worse,  calzones always came extra greasy and smaller. so me and my bf took a break from streets. then after a couple of months we decided to actually go inside to eat for the first time, and I was highly disappointed in the lasagna it was a plate of slop and the plate was super hot and boiling and dirty and looked burnt. It had sausage inside that had no flavor it was just not good and I think I'm probably done. I would stick to what I love which is the calzones but as far as lasagna I'm done getting slop for delivery and at that restaurant. Everything isn't the same as it used to be. Probably gonna take another long break from this place and hopefully next time it will be better."}
{"text":"Great pizza, and service was awesome!!!! We picked this place random, since we are from California and had no clue where to eat. So we passed by Rays pizza, and I must say....we enjoyed every bite. And their hospitality was very good.Thank you to Rays pizza!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Yeah, I like this place, every time they have food that is freash with a smile, they have a sitting area and a bar plus a outside sitting area. So they kinda have it your way, so sit and eat as a family or go and hang with some friends this is a place for you."}
{"text":"Was seated right away. Waitress was attentive. Food was good. I ordered a 14\" pesto pizza with spinach, mushrooms, artichoke, sun dried tomatoes and kalamata olives. Good. My daughter ordered med wings. The food came quick and was hot."}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty dam good. Service is where there slacking. You seat yourself and it takes quit a bit of time to get service. Be ready when your done eating to sit around and wait for your bill."}
{"text":"This was our second attempt here. We tried a few days before, and the dining room was completely full, and we didn't feel like freezing out on the patio (BTW, they did have heat lamps going). 
Being from NJ, I'm terribly critical of any Italian place, whether it be a chain or \"authentic\" (which I havn't found any chicken francaise in this state). 
We stopped here on a Monday night-The interior was small, and actually felt like a real pizza joint. So right away, they got some points from me.
There were 2 other occupied tables.
They gave us some garlic knots while we waited which was a very nice treat.
I had a meatball sandwich which was really good-and my husband has a chicken parm sandwich..also good, and i liked that you had a choice of white or wheat sub bread.
I havn't tried the pizza yet, but as far as hot sandwiches go, we'll be back.
Server was really friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"So I finally got a chance to compare the Streets of New York pizza to other pizzas. In short, I'll combine the good, bad, and the ugly all in one because spending money here was only partially worth the effort. The pie was dry and tasteless, however the toppings were fresh. Fries tasted as if they had been rewarmed and even though they looked seasoned, they hardly tasted flavored. The cheesecake was delicious."}
{"text":"My wife and I went inside to check it out from a coupon from a mailer.  Went inside and weren't greeted or welcomed.  The place was empty at the time and weren't welcomed by the woman behind the bar.  She then ONLY asked what we wanted(no greeting) and we said we had never been here before - asked what was good?  She handed us a stack of menus and said I don't know and then went made a phone call behind the bar.  We ordered and were ignored from the remainder of our stay.  There was a woman typing on a lap top singing to herself (looked like a manager of sorts) at the bar and the bartender who thought it was better to stare into space than to talk to the ONLY two people there.  She said after we ordered 20 mins and we left after 30.  I couldn't judge the food because we never ate there.  The service drove us away and we'll never come back."}
{"text":"Here is my summary of Streets of NY:

1) Greek salad-4 stars
2) Italian wedding soup-4 stars 
3) Pizza-1 star.


I've been to NY and this is not NY style pizza. Regardless of that, it simply isn't good. It reminded me Pizza Hut. Do not order the soup if you are on a low sodium diet. The delivery was prompt which was good....I guess."}
{"text":"Pizza wasn't very good at all. Either were the wings or pasta salad."}
{"text":"Two stars only because it's the Christmas season and I'm feeling generous. 

These guys are a mess. We ordered by phone and went to pick up.  The unpleasant young woman at the counter had no record of the order.  The guy (equally unpleasant) was taking a steady stream of phone orders and appeared close to meltdown, rolling his eyes at the customers' questions.

When he finally got off the phone he came over and just looked at me (it was now 20 minutes of waiting) and I told him what we ordered and the name it was under.  He shook his head and came out with a lukewarm box.  When I reminded him we had ordered a salad, he turned around without a word and grabbed a salad and gave me the total ($32 for a medium and a salad!?!)

I was hungry, tired and frustrated so I paid and got home to find they had not (as we requested) put forks in with the salad (we were at a hotel).

The pizza  - well, that's what a pizza place is all about, isn't it?
It was okay.  Nothing special.  I'd give it a B-.  

I could have ordered from Papa Johns and would have known what we were getting.  And it would be cheaper.  And they would deliver.  And I bet they would have actually been pleasant.  And maybe the pizza would have been hot.

Merry Christmas, Streets of New York. I hope tomorrow goes better for you than today did."}
{"text":"Decided to drop in at the last minute. Ordered the bruschetta, Caesar salad and lasagna.  The bruschetta was served with the topping in a small bowl surrounded by the toasted bread. Interesting presentation that worked well.... And very tasty.  The Cesar salad was average served with tomatoes and the dressing in a cup on the side.  The dish that stole the show was the lasagna.  It was one of the top 3 lasagnas that I have ever had, and I have traveled the world, including Italy.  It was a perfect portion served in a piping hot bowl with plenty of sauce and cheese baked in top.  I was truly in heaven. I ordered a cheesecake to go which was also delish. A very content and satisfying meal indeed.  Staff were great and the place has a good local-neighborhoodish vibe.  I may go back tomorrow ;)"}
{"text":"Had an early dinner at SONY and was pleasantly surprised with a great BOGO early bird special!  Okay, okay, I know this is supposed to be about the food, but it was the deal that made our experience so good.  SONY has always always had very good pizza and sandwiches.  Not world class, but that's not really their niche.  Anyway, we could buy any pizza, sandwich or pasta and get another pizza, sandwich or pasta free.  Can mix and match between items.  Our two person bill went from $26 to $17 dollars which made me a very, very happy check picker-upper.  Oh yes, the food was great and service great too.  No complaints."}
{"text":"Mostly good when you eat in. I had delivered yesterday, and its just not the same. The cheese comes off the slice of the pizza when you bite into it. 

Otherwise, its pretty good"}
{"text":"Overpriced 
Icky 
Not New York pizza. 
Made my tummy hurt. 
I don't recommend going there but I gave it two stars because pizza is pizza. You're just better off with dominos or Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"Grateful for the delivery, but I was, sadly, disappointed. The angel hair was overcooked and soggy. 3 bites in and the plate was a waste. The salad was colorful, but the lettuce was turning. Our combo pizza slice was decent-- great toppings selection, so it wasn't a fail! I'm sure it had been sitting out a while, as it was ordered by the slice. My son's ravioli made him happy which makes something of this order a success! I'll give it another try (if someone makes me), but as for tonight's meal, I don't think there was any love put into its prep. Like I said, it was delivered, so I hope the quality is better if I dine in."}
{"text":"Ohhhh, I've put off writing this review forever. It's time to face my shame. Streets of New York is one of my \"I am feeling awful, please make me happy\" indulgences. There is a three-step plan to bliss. The plan is as follows

1: Artichoke Dip. (It's not perfect. There could be a few more crusty bread things to go with it, but I usually get delivery, and there are pretzel chips in my cupboard.)
2: Pizza. (Thin crust, pepperoni and other things, depending on mood.)
3: Passion Cookie. (They will bring the cookie hot, with a little tub of ice cream and toppings ice cold to your door. Because they are objectively wonderful people)

Eat until you begin to regret.

I've never been into the restaurant, but I've ordered delivery a lot. For 1, 2, and for a party with about 12 people who couldn't make up their minds. Everything always arrives quick, hot (or cold, if applicable) and delicious. It's a crowd pleasing sort of pizza."}
{"text":"Poorly cooked pizza i will say that the people are somewhat nice when ordering but would not give this place another chance"}
{"text":"Great Pizza and perfect service. Your food comes incredibly quickly yet it is still amazingly fresh. I know this because I have been behind the kitchen and everything is fresh, nothing frozen. Not even the cheese. Perfect for a sport lover. Arizona sports heaven. If you just go for a mouthwatering dessert the passion cookie melts in your mouth with chocolate, caramel, peanut butter, and white chocolate chips are melted through an through the mini pizza size cookie topped with a delicious scoop of creamy vanilla ice cream drizzled with chocolate syrup!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza by the slice can never go wrong. the pizza is solid, but not enough for me to go crazy with the star delivery. Our large party was greeted and sat quickly, our server took good care of us and had a great attitude. I had the Alfredo with chicken, I thought the pasta was better than average and would recommend it to anyone in the moos for Alfredo. Prices were reasonable and the hot sandwich options might lure me back in again."}
{"text":"The waitress that works there is VERY kind and friendly. We sit on the patio and order appetizers. Got the wings, cheesy bread and small kids pizza. All were cooked fresh. I am not a stickler about food though. What matters to me is that 1) my drink was promptly brought to me and 2) that the wait staff was kind to my children. It is hard being a mom of three and always having a gaggle of kids in tow. Having a restaurant be kid friendly is seriously life changing. Happy hour is reasonably priced, food is of good quality and the wait staff is AMAZING. Go to this location."}
{"text":"This restaurant is quaint. If you have a family and want an intimate environment, this is the place. They take requests for what to watch on the TV, have kids juice and menus, with crayons. They also have meal specials that you can have text to your phone."}
{"text":"Ordered room service at a hotel and this was the company providing the food. They had an awesome menu, but the food ended up not being so awesome. I ordered spaghetti and a salad. First, they messed up the salad and gave me the wrong kind after I gave specific instructions. They did come back and give me the right salad and it was amazing. Then the spaghetti tasted like it was microwaved. I would've given 1 star, but due to the good salad and the guy that delivered being really kind and apologetic, I gave them an extra star. I wouldn't eat at their restaurant again, though."}
{"text":"the pizza was good but the chicken was the best I have had in a long time. They seam like they are a little under staffed but our waiter was great and keep us and all his tables  well stocked with drinks and food never kept us waiting for anything."}
{"text":"5 stars for the broasted chicken, and I'm not easy to please when it comes to broasted chicken.  Antipasto was good and nice size.  Appetizer sampler was ok, but inexpensive.  and we went on a day where kids eat free, so the two free kids meals were a bonus.  Service and food takes a while, not for lack of effort, just minimal staffing.  The marinara was delicious, but the pizza dough was only ok.  I'd definitely come back for the chicken."}
{"text":"Ordered our food over an hour ago, We understand a busy Friday night. When I called to check on our order, the girl on the phone couldn't even tell us where our food was or when it would be here. Really? So is it coming or not coming..... To eat or not to eat .... That is the question."}
{"text":"This was my first time ordering. We ordered two hot pastrami sandwiches and they were super hard. They had to give me wheat bread because they didn't have any white bread. In addition we ordered a spinach artichoke dip. However, the bread was supper hard and the dip was not a dip (see pic). You could pic the artichokes like they were mozzarella sticks. I don't think I would ever go back. I was not impressed what so ever. I would of had a better sandwich at cappriottis."}
{"text":"These people are rude. I ordered my pizza online, got a message saying it's ready, went to pick it up and noone greeted me. At all!! I stood there at the register and they didn't even acknowledge I was there. A customer came in after me and the lady looked around me to help HIM and still didn't acknowledge me! It took them 40 minutes to get my pizza out, which was cold! I counted 5 people came in and were greeted, ordered and got there pizzas BEFORE mine! Horrible.

I did call to express my disappointment and they gave me a credit."}
{"text":"I knew I wasn't going to be blown away by this pizza. I kept my expectations low. Rececntly Donald Trump took Sarah Palin to Famous Famiglia in Times Square for a slice of pizza. It was kind of odd for a guy who wants to epitomize NYC chose a chain, owned by Albanians. Then he chose to eat the slice with a fork and knife? Well, the pizza here at Streets of NY, makes me wonder what street in NY would I find this pizza? None. This is okay pizza, but it is not NYC pizza. The similarities end at the point of them both being round. The pizza here is okay. It is on par with Oregano's or NYPD. It is obviously better than Domino's or Papa Johns - how do they stay in business?? Its just not good pizza, its just pizza."}
{"text":"As a family - we love pizza, and pasta, and hoagies (and wine and beer).  Yes, these guys are capable of good food - just not consistently.  We've eaten in and out and at various SONY locations but this is one closest to our house and one we have TRIED to order for delivery quite a few times and each time we've been let down.  Tonight's order was, yet again, another let down with cold food, a long time delivery (quoted an hour max and we were wondering if we were going to get our food at the hour 15 mark), a big tab (me, hub and small child) and, well, a disengaged driver.  It is what it is... I fear we are running out of boutique-y pizza places in our area - the big chains aren't great but doggone-it they are consistently hot, timely and meet the expectation.  I love supporting local businesses but I shouldn't have to sacrifice quality for my money... right?  The positive - whatever frozen cake that gets thawed enroute - we enjoyed that.  Pizza, pasta and salad...boo.  Damn."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this place out since it's not far from our house. We got there about 5:45 and noticed they had happy hour on the appetizers, so we got some spinach artichoke dip. The dip was fantastic! Very flavorful with big chunks of artichoke. 
For the main dish, we decided on a margarita pizza on traditional crust instead of thin. It was brought to our table and it was thin crust...? We didn't say anything, we were hungry. So we both dug right in. It was so loaded with balsamic vinegar that after a couple pieces I couldn't do it anymore, so I stopped eating it. Between the olive oil and vinegar, it was dripping making the crust \"soggy\". 
So we finally get our bill, and she had charged us full price for the appetizer which should have been $5 instead of $8. 
Overall, it's a cute little pizza joint, but for the quality of food and the lack of attentiveness from the staff it's safe to say, go somewhere else. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"The most incredible pizza in Arizona. As a life long NY resident moving to the desert I can say without a doubt this pizza is the closest I've felt to home. Barros need to take some notes"}
{"text":"Didn't even eat. Just walked out. There were a few tables with purple all ready eating abd a handful of wait staff. We had to get or own menus waited for five minutes with the several servers standing around staring at us without coming to get a drink order. We left."}
{"text":"My family loves this place. It is a great family friendly place, or a place to just sit back and relax with your significant other. Go on dates here just to get out and be low key. We always get the baked ziti w no meat as we don't eat meat, so I can't speak for the rest of the food, but that and true breadsticks they serve while you wait are AMAZING. Always friendly wait staff. I'm super bummed they got rid of the eggplant Parmesan meal, it was my favorite. I do love their creamy marinara sauce on the pasta though...unique and way more delicious than just marinara alone. Couple that w a beer or some wine and you got yourself one relaxing, quaint evening. Oh, and as a plus of course, sports playing on the TV for my hubby is the best."}
{"text":"Have been ordering from them for years.  Really like the food. Unfortunately the customer service has really gone down hill. Finally tonight, ordered a pizza for pickup over the phone. The person taking the order was extremely rude. When I went to pick it up found out they forgot to pace my order. No apology offered. Will get my pizza somewhere else from now on."}
{"text":"We frequent streets quite often and have always had good service. My husband usually gets a pizza to share with the kids they love it and they love that the different toppings can be quartered on it so everyone can have what they want. I always enjoy a calzone...its full of deliciousness!  We will continue to return."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch. I was not expecting much as other Street's of New York I've been to have been a crap shoot with service and food. I now stand corrected. This location has delicious eats and great service thanks to our server Mikey.  Lunch specials are reasonably priced. Pleasantly surprised that the salad portion of my combo was more than substantial.  Very satisfied!"}
{"text":"I ordered about 45 minutes before closing time, they sent cheesecake instead of caramel crunch cake, they forgot the beer battered appetizer, the crust was close to raw in the pizza's center and I found a single mushroom on the Pizza. It was what sounded to be 2 younger guys who I spoke to when I called to confirm my allergies. I called the place after I realized how messed up the order was. They didn't answer the phone. 

I disputed the charges on my Amex for services/product not rendered.

Never again! Sorry"}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas around! 

Streets of New York has been around ever since I can remember, and they know how to make a good pizza pie. The crust is perfect (I always get the thick crust), it is full of flavor and definitely one that you look forward to biting into once you've finished off the cheese and other glorious toppings. There is something about the cheese they use that makes it unbelievably delicious; it is truly the perfect amount and flavor. The toppings are always fresh and in abundance. Along with pizza they also have pastas, wings, subs, breads, and other fried goodies to enjoy. The wings are a decent size and sauced up really well. While they do deliver and it is technically fast food pizza it isn't cheap. It can actually be a bit pricey, but worth every penny in my opinion. The staff is very friendly, hard working, and competent; they always get the order right and have the food ready on time. 

The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that the restaurant itself isn't exactly one with wonderful ambiance or charm. It's a pizza joint with tables, chairs, a few tvs, and a small patio. I much prefer to pick up my food and eat it at home, but that's up to you. Either way Streets of New York has awesome food and is on the top of my list when I want pizza!"}
{"text":"@Anne O.

You're horribly wrong on the price of toppings there. They are .95 per topping on the G/F pizza, as it is only offered in a 10\" As the size of the pizza goes up, the price of toppings do, which makes perfect sense. My suggestion, give it a try for yourself. 

Some of the best pizza in the valley. It's not your corer pizza joint. This is like.... Pizza's version of fine dining. Give it a try, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I ordered a Rueben. This has to be the worst Rueben I've ever had. The meat is so chewy I can't even eat it. The pasta salad is undercooked and tasted pre packaged. Gross."}
{"text":"I have been enjoying this hidden gem of NW Las Vegas for years. The service is always friendly and the food is great. Dinner time on the weekends can get busy but the wait is always worth it. The seasonal selection of Sam Adams is a nice touch. You won't go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch.  I had the pastrami sandwich with pasta salad ... Bone-in wings (ordered hot).  Could have been a lot hotter for my taste.  Great service ... Excellent food!!"}
{"text":"Great staff, friendly and considerate.  Fast if you're in a hurry or if you want to talk and relax. Sub #1 is excellent."}
{"text":"Have the servers be friendlier and more attentive to customers. I hate to be critical but these women have always made us feel like we were lucky for them to be waiting on us. It's a shame because they have the best pizza in town."}
{"text":"Haven't had streets in a long time and moved back into the area recently so decided to order a pie. 

Took over an hour for delivery for one pizza , so naturally it wasn't hot anymore. Got pepperoni, red peppers and tomato , and we struggled to find any red peppers on it at all, rest of toppings were low quantity. The sauce was just as skimpy which set the tone for a very dry, unappealing pizza. For $25 for one pizza, I expect a quality above the dominos/pizza hut/ papa johns fast food parade, but unfortunately I paid too much for a level equal or worse. 

The search continues for an excellent central Phoenix pizza delivery spot!"}
{"text":"Good pizza but $28 for a whole pie is kinda outrageous. We tried the bbq, hot, and parmesan garlic wings which were ok. 2 pies, 3 orders of wings and a salad= $100.00. I dont mind paying premium prices if the food is on point but I've had better pizza for less$."}
{"text":"Me and my husband have been here two times and we like it. Great food with good portions and friendly service. We definitely going back."}
{"text":"By far the worst and most overpriced pizza I've ever experienced.  If you want pizza just like this but want to get away cheap, buy the pizza from Sam's Club. Seriously.  I'm from NY and this is NOT what you find on the \"streets of NY.\""}
{"text":"Good food, good service and a place where everybody knows your name like in cheers.  Great family atmosphere.  Really good pizzas!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best artichoke dip I have ever had. We also enjoy their #7 The Best Of Everything sub. The restaurant was clean and the service was outstanding."}
{"text":"I just start ordering carry out from here and I'm impressed with the friendly staff and I LOVE their spinach salad, never eating spinach or walnuts before and now I'm obsessed with this salad cause it's delicious."}
{"text":"I really like their pizza, the crust is flavorful. And I get often their speggitti and meat sauce, simple and classic dish but really yummy here."}
{"text":"Streets of NY- thank you for your fabulous food! All is soooo good. Cannot wait for the wings. Best antipasto ever, hoagie is amazing and top it off with the best NY cheesecake! Ahhhh, feel like I am back east! Go to this location- fabulous!"}
{"text":"So friendly and accommodating!   The food was great.  Had thin n crispy pepperoni pizza, Italian sandwich and roaster chicken!   It was all fantastic.   Restaurant was spotless and lots of tv's to watch sports!   Will definitely be back!   Service was as good as the food."}
{"text":"We were at work and were looking to purchase lunch outside of our hospital cafeteria. We were originally going to try out a different pizza spot, but their fridge had gone out during the night that they lost most of their ingredients because of that incident. Anyhow, we went on Yelp and this place popped up. My coworker mentioned that she had tried this place so we decided to place an order. We ordered a large pizza with pepperoni, order of fried zucchini, and 20 pieces of wings. The pizza dough was gross and tough! The wings were hard as if they were re-heated from the previous day, and the zucchini sticks were nothing special. Need less to say I was not impressed. For $50+ you would think for that price range you would be  getting good delicious food. So do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. I will not be returning to this place!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing! The pizzas are delicious, the salads are yummy, and the beer selection is great. Great atmosphere and plenty of TVs to watch all the games. Unfortunately, the wait staff is rude, slow, unattentive, and would rather be elsewhere. This is a big deal breaker for me. If the food wasn't so consistently good, I wouldn't go back due to the horrible service. 5 star food, 1 star for service. I also wouldn't eat here without a coupon as the prices are ridiculous."}
{"text":"I love pizza and this place always satisfies. Double Pepperoni pizza extra crispy on traditional crust is my usual, and side of ranch for the bf. The Caesar salads are great but for some reason they put tomatoes and onions on it and no croutons. The staff always accommodates my food modifications. I'm a super picky eater. They also offer gluten free pizza also!!"}
{"text":"This place has great pizza and subs.  My wife and I love going here.  The staff is also really friendly.  I also love that they deliver.  I saw this big beer last time we were there;  I know what I am having next time!"}
{"text":"The pizza is great, but be careful.  We went during happy hour and the drinks are supposed to be reduced for domestic draught beer and house wine.  When we got our check, they said that Sam Adams isn't considered domestic beer and they don't carry that wine.  The menus are for Arizona not Vegas.  That is misrepresentation at its finest!"}
{"text":"First time we came here, the food was pretty good and they playing a great selection of rock songs. The second time, some weeks later, no music and the food was meh. Don't know happened but it wasn't good."}
{"text":"Love the @StreetsofNY lunch specials!

Two slices of cheese pizza, plus drink; or one slice, and a salad (caesar or garden), plus drink, for $5.

Went with my girlfriend, and loved the atmosphere at this location.

Their pizza is some of the best to be had, and though our waitress was ostensibly unable to distinguish between ranch, and bleu cheese, it was a pleasant experience.

I will definitely return to this location, as it's very close to home. :)"}
{"text":"I've been to @StreetsofNY a couple times now for a quick lunch, and I have to say, I think they're doing a really good job with the quick and easy.

2 slices of cheese pizza and a drink for 5 bucks is hard to beat. ($.50 for additional toppings)

The service is fast and friendly.

Definitely going to be going here a lot, since it's both close to work, and fast."}
{"text":"We go to this rest. mainly because it's between my kids school and home and there's a DQ across the parking lot.  The pizza is good (don't bother w/ the glueten free unless you've got a bet going)  I mean who goes to a pizza place if they're on a diet anyway. seriously.  Anyway we usually get a pizza and a sallad or app. The lights are always dimming like someone is getting electricuted in the back room... it's annoying. but the staff is ok, and if they screw up your order or forget something they are good about comping you.
Again it's a good solid 6 on a 0-10 scale but the convienent location is the why we've gone back there maybe once every 1.5 mos."}
{"text":"Stick to the Pizza maybe?

I had a slice of my nephew's cheese and it seemed pretty good. I ordered the baked ziti and found it lacked flavor. When I saw they used sausage in the dish I was hoping for some spice, some sweetness, some spoiled meat taste, ANYTHING! Instead I got a big plate of bland. The only bite I took that was flavorful incorporated nearly half of the mozzarella topping.

The garlic bread nuggets served as an appetizer were very good. I was just expecting more from the pasta."}
{"text":"Best thin crust pizza I've had in a very long time!!! Cheaper than most places we have been as well. Wed is the day to go for cheap wine/pizza...just an FYI. Also we always get the same waiter and he's very friendly! Never disappointed with this place. Don't understand the low ratings on this location???"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed in my overall experience at this restaurant.  We got there around 6:30 on a Saturday night.  The place was full but we managed to get a table.  Nice inside but very noisy.  There was no greeter and the sign said to seat yourself.  It took about 10 minutes before I finally flagged down our server to get our order put in.  She seemed entirely flustered and disorganized.  Another server had previously taken our drink order.  They advertise complimentary garlic knots.  I had to ask our server for these, and she said \"If they are made.\"  This is after I saw two other tables get complimentary garlic knots ahead of us.  She never went back to the kitchen to check.  I watched her as we were seated near the kitchen area.  Finally I flagged down a different server and he brought us a small order.  They were good but the marinara dipping sauce they serve it with was cold.  My wife ordered pasta with bolognese sauce and mushrooms with a garden salad.  I order a sandwich and we split a pizza with pepperoni and garlic.  My wife's salad came out first.  Once again brought by another server, not our server.  Then they brought out the pizza.  It was cooked well but there was no sauce whatsoever and they put way to much roasted garlic on it.  It was overpowering to the point that all you tasted was garlic.  After I ate one piece my stomach was upset.  Then about 5-10 minutes after the pizza came, they  brought my wife's pasta.  She ordered it with no cheese, and of course there was cheese.  She sent it back.  They brought the same pasta dish out with the cheese scrapped off and a different type of sauce poured over the top then the bolognese.  The pasta sauce tasted watery like it came from a jar.  It really had no flavor and was unappealing to look at and it tasted even worse.  During this time my sandwich had not come.  I watched as my sandwich was put up in the window where the server's take the food from the kitchen.  It sat there for over 10 minutes as our server or any other server failed to bring it to our table.  it was moved several times around the window it was sitting on.  out of the heat lamp so it was getting cold.  At one point it was taken off the window and put on the server's table and then moved back up to the window Finally I had enough and I asked a different server to take the sandwich off my bill because it was sitting up there for over 10 minutes.  We just wanted to pay for the pizza and pasta and it get out of this restaurant.  Just as we did that our server showed up with the sandwich in hand saying that it just came up.  We informed her that it did not just come up and that it had been sitting there for over 10 minutes and that she had failed to bring it to our table.  I asked for the check and she brought it.  She asked if we wanted to go boxes and we turned her down because we said we were disappointed by the food and the service.  After she ran my card she said that we didn't have to pay if we didn't enjoy the food.  That was about all she did correct the entire evening.

It safe to say that I will never return to this restaurant.  I am not a difficult customer.  I rarely ever send food back to the kitchen, but this server and restaurant failed on so many accounts that I had no choice but to voice my opinion about how poor the food and service was.  I would highly recommend you try another pizzeria before going to this one.  Flat out disappointing in all categories."}
{"text":"Went here tonight with my husband and my two boys. It was our first time. The food was really great we got pizza and wings. The service however was not so great. The waitress was really nice but she was all by herself and the restaurant was pretty full. We never got a drink refill and had to track someone down for the check. Our kids were really losing it by the time we got out of there. Bummer because the food was great!"}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible, horrible. I ordered from this place using a food delivery app. They got my order wrong, omitted items, and when I called they stated that it was correct and I \"wasn't charged\" for the items they omitted and that they had no record of me ordering them. I called Grubhub to complain. Grubhub apologized, gave me a discount, and informed me that this place had in fact given me the incorrect order/ omitted an item. They literally gave me 7 fries, a gross cheesesteak, an a tiny scoop of ice cream. Avoid this place! They will rip you off. Your food is garbage!"}
{"text":"First time here in a very long time.  We started with the bruschetta appetizer.  Very fresh tasting tomato/basil and spices mixture served on thin pizza crust which more resembled pita wedges.  Very good. If we had known about the unlimited supply of soft bread with dipping sauce we probably would have skipped the appetizer. Then we split the baked ziti.  Again, very tasty. (Can't imagine one person eating all of that.)  Also very reasonable happy hour prices.  We will definitely be back.  Would recommend this restaurant to anyone.  We will probably have the pizza next time.  Marissa, our waitress was very attentive!!"}
{"text":"I just wanted to update my review of Streets. We have turned into Friday night regulars. There is no question of where we go on Friday nights now, Streets it is. Stacey, Britney, and the rest of the staff and great. We have had a good bit of the food they have to offer and have absolutely no complaints. The lasagna, spaghetti, and pasta dishes they serve are always good and large portion, which usually yield enough for lunch the next day. The pizza as mentioned in my previous review is great. The passion cookie dessert is still phenomenal when we are not too full from the other great food. I would recommend this establishment to anyone looking for good italian or pizza. We will definitely be going back, every Friday that is."}
{"text":"Food was cold, took forever, and it was really really expensive.  For wings and Liza at $70 I expect it to be delicious.  Too many options around to go here.  Bummer I used to love streets of New York"}
{"text":"I've ordered about six times from this place. Mostly pasta dinners, but I got a pizza once and a meatball parm. Pizza was a mistake. I got the thin crust and it was like a cracker crust. It tasted fine but it's just not my style. I love thin crust pizza but I like to fold the slices (I'm from NJ originally). Meatball sandwich was delicious and came wit a choice of sides. I got the pasta salad and it was surprisingly good. Homemade and not heavily dressed. All pasta dishes were very good with the exception of the lasagna. I thought there was too much meat and not enough to ricotta but that's me. If you like meaty lasagna you'll probably love it. I need to mention their baked ziti (née penne). It was exceptional in that it included hunks of link sausage. Possibly the best takeout ziti al forno I've ever eaten outside of NJ. In summary,  except for my screw up ordering the wrong pizza crust and for giving me too much meat in my lasagna, I would have rated it 5 stars"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery last week. We got the Cobb salad and the Ultimate New York Cheese Steak and the Italian beef.  Everything was amazing! Best Cheese Steak ever. The food was hot and fresh, great flavors and generous portions. It was so good we are ordering again today."}
{"text":"I've been calling these people for years. The consistency and quality are amazing at this place. Take it from a guy who eats Pizza three times a week and orders all around the valley. Love the service in the staff. I will continue to order from this place regardless of the negative just like in life you can't please everybody and if you notice the ones that cry are the ones that are just big babies and live in a perfect world for me they do a good job stand by their product and always do what's right."}
{"text":"Love this place, I get the thin crust pizza and they make it perfect every time. The servers are always friendly."}
{"text":"The pizza is average. I had their specialty pizza with the meatballs, didn't do much for me. It needed fresh ingrediants, and I could tell everything came from a can/jar. The cheese especially was not that great; what I would do to get this place some fresh cheese for their pies! The potential is there, but they miss the mark.

The Broaster chicken steals the show. Nice, juicy, and the skin is just a tad crispier than you would find at the grocery store. The problem here is that it reminds you of grocery store fried chicken.

But they have delivery most of the time! So no waiting until the evening to get delivery like other places in town.

The wings are average, I think all the pizza places buy their frozen wings from the same restaurant depot."}
{"text":"Was supposed to take 40 minutes for delivery from time of ordering even after the 49 minutes I checked to see how long and it said it was on the way 20 min later I called and they said it just left another 20 min later we finally got our cold overpriced food.

Meatballs were not tasty the cypress sandwhich was horrible, two super small pieces of warm mozzarella on an oversized wheat bun (even though I ordered white bun).

For an order over $100 you think they would pay extra special attention.

We should have ordered from the other pizza place everyone else ordered from whose food was there in 30 minutes piping hot and super yummy and we'll over $100 as well."}
{"text":"Ordered for pick up
Yelp pizza special  $ which the polite man on the phone accepted. He really had a nice attitude 
Pizza was ready on Sunday night in 20 mins
Very delicious . Ordered 6 yummy wings too
Definitely will use again"}
{"text":"We were in the mood for some pizza on the patio tonight but when we arrived we were told that the patio was closed because someone was cleaning chairs out there and therefore we could not dine on the patio.  There was one guy on the patio cleaning and we didn't really see why we couldn't enjoy the beautiful weather.  It's a shame because we went somewhere else because we love their pizza."}
{"text":"Always really good!!! I usually pick up and take home and pizza anywhere is always better there hot n fresh outa oven.... love the taste toppings AND beer!!"}
{"text":"Do not recommend!! We decided to try this because we didn't want to cook tonight being that the next two days are going to be hectic and it was incredibly disappointing. The pizza was average at best. The street fries were only half cooked and not seasoned. The potato bacon soup was bland and rubbery. And the canolis were also sub par at best. Seems to me that they didn't really wanna cook tonight either. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza from here tonight and decided to call after an hour and a half had passed by.  The girl on the phone was rude and said the pizza was already out for delivery (we live 4 minutes away) then proceeded to hang up on us mid-sentence.  We called back ten minutes later after the food had still not arrived and talked to the same girl who proceeded to put us on hold for 3 minutes.  She said she would cancel and refund the order.  I then asked nicely, \"no apology or anything?\" to which she responded saying oh yeah, I'm sorry but it wasn't my fault.  Not sure how the food is, but the service is lackluster."}
{"text":"Streets of New York is a damn classic. How can anyone say anything bad about this little pizza place?
I had plenty o' lunches and dinners here as a young high school student, and then as a college student and still today, I enjoy an occasional slice of pie, salad and garlic bread.
The only problem is I can never get my friends to go with me. Just what is it about the Streets they don't like? I can't figure it out.
So if you go and you see a brunette eating in a booth alone, say hello. I could really use some Streets of New York lovin' friends."}
{"text":"This was our first visit, after having friends tell us about the place, and also receiving a discount for Teacher Appreciation Week.   We were pleasantly surprised with the looks of the place inside.   People were friendly and they were well staffed.   We figured that they were going to be getting busy with the amount of servers on duty.                We had 2 minutes left before happy hour expired, so we ordered appetizers on the special menu.   Drinks were served immediately and then the plates of yummy goodness started arriving.   First we received a basket of garlic bread knots with marinara sauce, a plate with ramekins of bruschetta AND hot artichoke dip served with seasoned sliced bread, then the garlic cheesy bread arrived.   Unbeknownst to us, they give an order of complimentary garlic knots for lunch and dinner.   The dips and garlic cheesy bread we ordered.....so our table was fit for appetizers for 4+ when there was only 2 of us.  So, we indulged in a bit of everything that we ordered and got free and we are pleased to say that  everything was delicious!    The hot artichoke dip was divine, the bruschetta needed a bit more seasoning, the garlic cheesy bread was true comfort food and the complimentary garlic knots were yummy.   The marinara sauce that came with the cheesy bread and garlic knots was  very nicely seasoned and made like home made, not like plain tomato sauce flavor you get at restaurants nowadays.   
     For our main meal we ordered the New York Combo which is their  \"Flagship Pizza\"  It has a great medley of flavors including Italian sausage, pepperoni,
meatballs, along with mixed bell peppers, mushrooms, onions, black olives and mozzarella cheese. Simply put, it's great!   Along with the pizza we ordered Broasted Chicken!    I haven't had broasted chicken in years, and they had a special deal on the price if you ordered a 20\" or larger pizza.    Oh MY!!   The chicken was absolutely AMAZING!!   Needless to say, we took a lot home and left very full and happy.  
     We will definitely return and bring friends to experience the food with us.   They had pricing for ordering large amounts of broasted chicken (50 pieces) and I am going to order this for a special occasion we have coming up.    Many people have never even heard of broasted chicken and they will not be disappointed when they try it.   
     Go and enjoy!!"}
{"text":"They have a pretty little patio with lights and really friendly staff around . We ordered for our custom made pasta and it tasted good ! Prices are slightly on the higher side ."}
{"text":"Food was good.  Service was sub-par.  Environmental services awarded this restaurant an A.  They likely were not served by our waitress.  I observed her cleaning the restrooms,  mopping the floor,  handling the mops,  brooms etc without washing her hands.  I cringed at her bringing our food out but promised my other half I wouldn't embarrass him by asking her to wash her hands.  I am a fan of this pizza chain but will likely reconsider  visiting this one again."}
{"text":"Have gotten take out here multiple times, and have had no complaints. The crust is better depending on the chef. 
We decided to have a pizza delivered for the first time. That was a huge mistake. Took over an hour, pizza was barely warm and for $30.00 we at least expected a hot pizza! We live less than 1/2 mile away too. Live and learn, we will never do that again!"}
{"text":"03/01/2015
I took my kids to the Streets of new York on bell and grand in surprise today for lunch. worst service of my life. was told very rudely when we walked in and were waiting to be seated that it was seat yourself. most of the empty tables were covered with messy dishes and food. we found an empty booth but it wasn't even wiped down. after sitting there 10 min the waiter, an African American man came and wiped down the table and said he would get us menus. we waited 5 min for him to come back and at that point he took our drink order of water and two children's sprites. I waited almost 15 min for those drinks and he finally took our order. I ordered a basket of fries and a 10\" pepperoni pizza. not that difficult an order to fulfill. it took 20 min for our fries to get to the table and when he brought them out he accidentally put his finger in the ketchup and all he said is \"well that's just freakin great!\" in front of my kids. he took that ketchup and he never returned to our table. we never received a replacement ketchup and after about an hour and a half in that restaurant my kids were getting impatient and it was clear to me that he was ignoring my attempts to get his attention. another waitress walked by us several times and never acknowledged us and the young man working in the front seemed to be standing around doing nothing. I decided it wasn't worth staying there anymore and I clearly wasn't going to get a hot pizza so I went up to the front to pay for the fries and drinks. after about 5 min of the young man ignoring my attempts to get his attention I just left without paying. And before I left I counted all the tables that were still dirty from when we walked in and it was 6. 6 tables with dirty dishes and old food from prior to my arrival an hour and a half before. This was the worst dining experience I've ever had. sad to say we would have received much more courteous service if we had gone to jack in the box or McDonalds instead. I will not return to this facility. Wish I could give it negative stars."}
{"text":"My facility orders from here all the time...the pizza is pretty good, but it doesn't have me coming for more. What I'm trying to say is...I've had better pizza. I've tried their veggie, marg, cheese.

I've also had their caprese sandwich as well - it was good and the basil was perfect but man, the mozzarella was WAY too much. I probably had a good ten pieces of fresh mozzarella in my sandwich. I needed to remove a few pieces to actually enjoy my meal.

I'll probably keep eating from here so long as my facility keeps ordering, but don't think I'd go out of my way."}
{"text":"The Broaster fried chicken was bomb!  The baked wings are pretty good.  I'm loving the sandwich!  The prices are decent and the food is even better!  This is a must try spot!"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant! I am so pleased that there are gluten-free crust options. This is our go-to pizza place."}
{"text":"This place has amazing everything!! The garlic bread the broasted chicken The pepperoni  pizza!!! It's alllllll delicious and the staff is amazing. We received great customer service and we will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"BEEN GOING TO THIS PLACE FOR WELL OVER 15 YEARS AND WILL NEVER SET FOOT IN THERE AGAIN. Went there tonight only to find that they raised their prices about 25% and cut the portions in half. Spoke to the manager and he could care less about my concerns. I can understand price increases (to a point) but to raise them and deliver less product is preposterous. Crazy thing is that the food quality and tastes have also been compromised. Stoffers now does a better product in the frozen section of your local grocery store. This location should be out of business by Christmas. NO STARS."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here. It took over1hr 30minutes even though I could walk there from my house in 15 minutes. The food is good though and I would order here again"}
{"text":"There best service is no service at all, good food, but the waitress likes to talk to the cook, instead of helping the customers. It seem all the waitress like the cook and not to serve the customers. My wife and I like the the fact it's close to our house, and the food is good. It's just poor service."}
{"text":"I give this place 1 star only because I cannot give none. I was expecting a NY style pizza as they mentioned over the phone.
So I went ahead and spent the $30+ on two Large NY Cheese Pizzas and an order of garlic knots. 
The pizza cheese was not soft and melted like other pizzas and there was no flavor at all to them. The other thing that I hated was that most of the cheese were bubbled up and burnt. My family can usually finish a whole pizza and more,  but this time each of us only had 1 at most (3 of us only had half). I do not recommend this place. Maybe they had an off night. In this economy, $30 for two pizzas...bad pizzas at that."}
{"text":"I'm only rating this review based on the broaster chicken at this location.  This chicken is awesomely delicious, crispy outside and juicy inside - not greasy.  We are addicted to this and buy this expensive treat far too often.  We have had the pizza in the past and didn't care for it.  We also had an italian salad and didn't like it.  Their sides with the chicken aren't too great, either (fries, etc.).  The wings are great because they're broasted but the hot sauce isn't good and sometimes tastes \"off\" so we don't eat it.  Bottom line:  get the broasted chicken and nothing else, you will love it!"}
{"text":"I get delivery from this Streets of NY all the time, because I live around the corner. Fast delivery time, food is pretty good and consistent with the other locations. Would recommend it. Anytime I've gone in to pick up food the place looked clean, and the staff was very helpful."}
{"text":"Excellent service and we really enjoyed the food. We had the antipasti salad and meatball pizza. We were served passion bread as an appetizer and it was delicious.Would definitely come again...1 star off for torn vinyl in the booths."}
{"text":"If I could give this place negative stars I would. Thanks for the dog food and the 2 hour delivery. After two calls and complaining at least he credited my account after being supremely rude. Telling a customer he doesn't have time to argue. I'm never one to write these nasty reviews....but this one is well deserved."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered take out from this location today. The \"cheesesteak\" was, in all honesty, disgusting. Soggy, mushy, rubbery, and flavorless. The \"roast beef\" seems more like mystery meat. I've had better cheesesteak out of a package.  The Italian Stallion was less than mediocre and cold.  Complete waste of money. Extremely dissatisfied with the food and the take out service."}
{"text":"Ordered the Italian wedding soup,  gorgonzola pear salad, and a slice of cheese cake.  The soup was delicious and the salad was yummmmmyyyy and fresh. I do wish there was more greens in the salad though.  No complaints because it was soooooooo scrumptious.  The cheesecake was ok. It was a big piece but needed something like a fruit topping.  

Delivery was a little slow but I ordered right at lunch time so I can't be mad at them.  

I would eat here again for sure.  The salad alone is one I will want again.  Oh, the meatballs in the soup..... mmMmmmmm... that is all..."}
{"text":"I ordered a salad and some wings and it took over an hour for them to arrive. This place is about 5 mins away from me so I think that is ridiculous. The wings were good, but the salad had bacon all over it so I couldn't even eat it. The description didn't say there was bacon and it looked good so I was disappointed. Everything seemed fresh, but I can't get over waiting an hour for a salad I couldn't eat and some wings."}
{"text":"I emailed Debra and Streets of New York within two days of her reply and I have not heard back yet. It has been over a month. 

Just as expected.

10/9/2017  Hello,

We appreciate you leaving the review and giving us a chance to not only correct the situation within our location, but most importantly you, our customer.  Would you mind emailing me at info@streetsofnewyork with the date and time of your order?  We will make this situation right for you.  

For the record, you do not need a medical or law degree to understand pizza delivery.  It does appear that we may need a refresher course on our customer service skills.  Thank you again for bringing it to our attention!

On your email could you please reference \"store #19 10/7 Yelp\" for me.  

Kindly,

{"text":"Let me just say that for the pizza, I give it 4 stars. I'm from the north east and New York pizza is something I miss since I moved out west. Closest thing I've found to the authentic stuff!! Will definitely be back when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I was thinking this place was gonna be 
Good. I WAS SO!!! Wrong!!! When we walked
In we seen a sign that says, seat your self.
We did. Lady seen us but did not give us
Menus. i had a philly, that says in the menu
Its very big!!!! I got it with no ONIONS. When I
Got it, it looked to be a childs size. YA! Real big
Lol. it was also really bad! There was no 
Green peppers or mushrooms. Just very bad
Raw meat and a little cheese. The bread was good.
It came with a side of fries, there was about 8 fries
In my plate. The pizza was NOTHING!!!!!!! Like
NEW YORK!!!! Its more like frozen junk you get
At a store. Such a waste of money. also we were
Told they have free bread, but didnt have anymore!
Well then, why bring it up? Lol and to top things
Off it was soooo HOT!!!!!!!!!! Inside. Ok this is vegas
Put your air on! It was hotter inside then it was 
Outdoors. I will never eat here again. I can not put
Into words how bad the meat was. I feel sick just 
Thinking about it. This place is just paste and old
Bread. Not! New york pizza."}
{"text":"Streets is a perfect little neighborhood pizza spot, but it is not epic pizza that should send you on a quest from the far corners of the Vegas basin. We ended up on this side of town, and we were about to go for Mexican, when we ran into a yelper who convinced us this pizza was better than the burritos. We decided to give it a go. 

The restaurant is casual with plenty of tables. The menu has pizza, wings, sandwiches, salads and Italian offerings. There are two crust options, and we went with the thin and crispy. It was indeed very thin and very crispy. 

We asked the waitress if there was plenty of sauce, and she assured us, yes. Pizza came and it had exactly zero sauce. She admitted she didn't realize the pizza that we had ordered did not come with sauce. It wasn't a big deal, just a little disappointing. We ended up getting sauce on the side and spreading it on the top. The sauce was tasty, but we probably looked a little odd smearing sauce onto the top of our pizza.

The toppings were fresh. The flavor was good, and it wasn't the least bit greasy. However, I could have used a bit more gooey goodness from the cheese. It just seemed a little stale, not melty and delicious.

It gets the pizza job done."}
{"text":"I had dinner here on a Friday with a few friends. Food was ok, server was fine but annoying, atmosphere was about what you'd expect, kind of loud and a baseball team full of middle schoolers and their families arrived while we were eating. 

Full disclosure: I did not try the pizza. I shared fettuccini alfredo with spinach and chicken and angle hair pasta with pesto and zuccini and also the garlic cheese bread to start. I was disappointed with the cheese bread but I was hungry enough not to care. I also snagged some of my friend's fries and enjoyed them (although definitely not the best fries I've ever had). It did the job and we weren't hungry by the time we left, but it wouldn't be worth going back. My friends advised me to get pizza from Spinatos in the future. 

I was going to give the place 2 stars, but one of my friends left his phone inside and the waiter ran outside after us to return it, so that server gets an extra star :)"}
{"text":"I cannot believe how rude the staff is at the 35th and northern location.  We decided to splurge tonight and get what we thought was going to be good pizza.  First of all, we waited over an hour and a half for our pizza and street fries to get delivered.  When the delivery guy gets to our door I asked him how much he said 23 and some change and I handed him 25$ and proceeds to walk away and not offer change.  Already assuming that he would keep the rest.  When I bring the food in and open it the fries were soggy and lukewarm like it had been sitting out.  The pizza looked the same, it was almost cold and the cheese was coagulated.  My boyfriend and I just found it unappetizing and we decide to call back and complain.  To which Brandy replies that they were really busy but they were going to make the food over and send it out.  We then decide that we don't want the pizza anymore because we waited so long already for them to have delivered us old food.  So I call back and advise brandy that we changed our minds and we would come into the store and return the food and that we were going to get something else for dinner.  Basically just to show them why we were so unhappy and also get a refund.  I walk into the store and woman is on the phone and doesn't acknowledge me.  When she hangs up the phone  I smile and greet here.  She still doesn't acknowledge me and just shuffles papers and stapler around and then finally says Oh you are Ria?  I said yes I bought the food here just want to show you the food and also get my refund.  She says I have to ask Scott to approve the refund and heads to the back and I can see her talking to the older man in the back and he is obviously complaining anf talking to her about the whole situation right in front of me.  After I wait there for about what feels like 10 min he finally comes to the front saying \"you shouldn't have come we already had the food done and we were going to bring it out.\"  \"Next time don't come here.\"  \"Also we don't do cash refunds, but tonight I will make an exception.\"  
To which I reply to this \"well there wont be a next time.\"  
And he says \"See what happens when you try to do someone a favor.\"
He hands me my money and says under his breath \"Enjoy your burgers.\"
I proceed to ask him \"what is your problem, you think that you can just say whatever you want to your customers?\"
He says \"Aren't you getting burgers?\"  Acting completely ignorant and Brandy chimes in \"Well aren't you getting burgers you said you were getting burgers on the phone.\"
I said no I did not I said we are going to get something else.
Scott says \"Well I'm not gonna stand here and argue with you.\"  Mumbles things under his breath as im walking out.
I tell my boyfriend what happened and goes into the store.
Scott tells him that I am no longer allowed in the store because I was droping f bombs.
My bf just shook his head and walked out.
I call another location to get information about how to take this to upper management only to find that Scott is the general manager of the store.
This man and even his staff specifically Brandy are absolutely horrid.  He even admitted to messing up the first time on the food.  THey knew the food was old and still sent it out to us and acted as if he was doing me a favor by returning my money, which by the way did not include the tip.  I would never recommend anyone to go to Streets.  He sets a bad image for the whole company.  If you care about your customers I would recommend you find a new manager who cares about customer service."}
{"text":"I went to this place  on a date, and I ordered a gluten free pizza, when my pizza showed up , I ate it and quickly realized it was  not a gluten free pizza. Thanks streets of new York for ruining  the rest of my night because I couldn't be more than 5 feet from a freaking toilet."}
{"text":"I had no idea there was more than one location of this place.  This thoroughly surprised me because the food at this place tastes homemade and is nothing short of incredible.  The sandwiches are off the hook and the Lasagna is world class.  My one humble ask would be that in addition to gluten free pizza crust, please offer Gluten Free Pasta!  My family and I would be there 2x per week at a minimum if this were offered."}
{"text":"This location is down the street from where I work and I eat here for lunch a few times each year.  The quality is very good and I enjoy the lunch sandwich specials, especially the Italian sandwich.  I should eat here more often."}
{"text":"Ordered spaghetti marinara with meatballs and cheesy bread. It was a delivery. Food came piping hot and fresh. The delivery bags were thick and not cheap even came with card board reinforced bottom so that sauce, etc doesn't splash all over. I appreciate attention to detail.

Food was killer came with three meat balls not two. Sauce was tick and delicious not watery. Cheesy bread was smothered in cheese and it was a huge portion. I'll be going back there again!"}
{"text":"Wow ~ I don't know what's happened to this place, but it has seriously gone downhill. We were debating ordering some garlic bread, and then remembered our meal came with the complimentary bread, so decided to just go with that. After waiting for about 10 minutes, our waitress came back to tell us \"We're still about 15 minutes out on the bread, so you might want to order some garlic bread if you want bread before your meal\". I asked her if we were supposed to pay for bread simply because they didn't have any ready, and she said \"I guess if you want some, that's your only option\". Ummmm how about comping the $3.50 garlic bread since it was your error to begin with? Maybe it's a small thing but it was SO tacky and they just have a \"couldn't care less\" attitude here...Way too many options right in this area to put up with that!!"}
{"text":"The worse service I've ever gotten, if you don't mind waiting an hour and a half for one pizza. Was avoided all nite.  I'm telling everyone I know not to come here. If there were negative stars available I would give them negative 3 stars. Only thing good was the beer but... It got warm on me waiting for my pizza. I'm never coming back here again..."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I have been going here pretty consistently for 2-3 years and the staff is great!  Happy Hour is always a winner, and the beer is always served in a very frosty mug.  This is our go-to place when we want fast, friendly, delicious service."}
{"text":"Streets of New York is exemplifies the meaning of family owned, comfortable, neighborhood resturant. The first time I came here in 2008 it reminded me of the sitcom \"cheers\" where you can literally come hang out every day. The food is great, they serve beer and wine and the atmosphere is great. If your just by yourself it's cool to because all the employees are friendly and take the time to stop and talk if that's what your looking for. If your in a rush that works too because you can place an order and be done and gone in less than 30 minutes. All in all its my favorite neighborhood hangout."}
{"text":"Just had another outstanding entree from Mark and Ginger, Streets of NY!
All we can say is that their restaurant and everyone employed there are OUTSTANDING!
We have been customer's since Nov. 2011.
We love to either visit there for a meal, or order in. Either way, the food is always awesome, and the service is  10 stars!
Mark, Ginger, Mary Ann, Jared (a Navy man now! ) and ALL others there care wonderful people. They always make us feel welcome, and are very accomodating.
Thank you!
Mike and Jan...Tramonto"}
{"text":"WOW WOW WOW! !!

I ordered a double pepperoni pizza and a slice of chocolate cake and now need a cold shower,  because it was THAT GOOD.  Service was quick and friendly as well.  I will be making this wonderful restaurant my regular pizza stop."}
{"text":"First time ordering from this place (Tropicana/Fort Apache). Significant price difference from online menu to what they charged me when I picked up my food.  Called in my order right when they opened, ordered a thin slice pizza (which they got wrong- got a thick crust or something) for 2 people (8 slices/4 toppings) & a Greek salad- came out to $33.  Their online menu said $10 something up to 4 toppings. The pizza was mediocre.  The salad was not even edible.  The lettuce was brown, cucumber was gummy, tomatoes was dried up, red onion was old.  Bottom of salad was sitting on water!  Brought salad back, showed them & I can't believe one of the girl that worked there said \"I don't see nothing wrong w/it, I would eat it.\"  I said wow really even if it's this rotten?  The other co worker said, \"hmm I don't know, I don't really eat salad.\"  I think these kids were messing w/me because anybody in their right mind can see how old & awful this salad was.  Grateful though I got a refund but I'll never come back."}
{"text":"Long story short, the manager I'm assuming of this place was just a real jerk..I'm putting that a little too kindly.. he was too busy standing around watching the baseball game on the tv that when the poor new girl who was taking our order tonight didn't even know what was on the menu and had to run and ask for help at each little thing we were ordering .. food was great, customer service and poor training skills might make me never want to go back though. Word to the manager; Don't be a jerk to your employees, make sure they have the right amount of training and know what's actually on your menu and maybe you should too since you didn't know what the \"marinara cream sauce\" was on your menu.  Here's a tip!  So you're not confusing yourself or customers might just want to change it to \"pink sauce\" as you put it..."}
{"text":"Dropping these guys a star, because our last 2 visits for the Broaster chicken resulted in chicken that was too salty. We thought maybe it was a fluke - but last visit shows us that maybe its not. Chicken still gets 5 stars for crispiness though!

We'll go back, but maybe we'll branch out from the chicken. The Italian Beef sandwich was nice and tasty (and tender) - although I'm not sure I agree with the idea of a sesame-seed bun for it."}
{"text":"1st of all, a delivered 14\" 2 topping pizza, cost $26!!  I would be ok with that if the pizza was good, which was not the case.  It  was the worst pizza ever!  Like another review stated, it was tasteless."}
{"text":"I do love this place great specials and who knew an Italian place could serve great chicken"}
{"text":"Great pizza especially is you order the hand tossed thin and crispy.  They provide very generous portions of spaghetti.  I love the rolls and cold beer!!!!"}
{"text":"i bought a Groupon to check out this eatery. it is very close to my house. we ordered: Eggplant rolitini w/angel hair and cream sauce, \"Big Tuna\" Sub Sandwich with onion rings, and Calzone with mushrooms, blk olives, onions,&bell pepper mix. total : $33.50 w/tax.the eggplant rolitini is not the best. very rubbery,stuffed with ricotta cheese, smothered in red sauce to mask the blandness. the angel hair with cream sauce is edible.the Calzone is about the size of a folded Pizza Hut personal pizza. the ingredients inside were plenty and very good. it is good;but, not the best. Sicily's Pizza on Durango has the biggest(12\" !!) and best Veggie Calzones . the \"Big Tuna\" did not really have much tuna salad in it at all to warrant \"Big Tuna\".  it was mostly bread. the winner was the onion rings that came with the sub... WOW!! the onion rings were HUGE, very smoothly dipped in beer battery, and fried to a gorgeous and crunchy golden brown . it is straight up exactly the onion rings i used to get from a local Brooklyn pizza joint. it was a large serving too. i love that! no joke , the rings were so big, i could have worn it as a bracelet. they were not soggy at all. whomever is cooking it knew what they were doing. the restaurant is very clean, great atmosphere, nicely furnished, and very welcoming. i would come back for the onion rings."}
{"text":"Terrible fucking service. Waiter is wasted as hell. They said they didn't have bread and couldn't give it to us. They have B rating which is 14-27 violations."}
{"text":"I tend to do reviews after giving a couple chances to the company to really see how they are. so with that said This was our third time eating with this place. The first time was perfect, macaroni salad was to die for. The second time my husband ordered the onion rings and they only gave him 4...yes...4 onion rings. I called and they gave me a credit of $2.50. I decided to give them another chance and try their pizza last night. While the pizza was good, it wasn't worth the money we paid especially since it was cold pizza and I had to heat it up in the oven. I should have just ordered from dominos. We are never eating here again...."}
{"text":"I'm currently sitting in my booth enjoying my happy hour food & drinks....and I immediately felt this place deserves all 5 stars! It's my first time here and food was amazing and lucky for them I live around the corner and will most definitely be back sooner than later! Don't drive past again without stopping to check the food out yourself."}
{"text":"If you like eggplant, you must order the eggplant rollatini.  It is fantastic.  The sauce is just right and the eggplant is not breaded.  YUM! Pizza is great too!  Family atmosphere.  They can be a little slow on service sometimes, but for the most part they are great.  Delivery is great too and my orders are always right."}
{"text":"I'd never been here before, but I got a gift card for my birthday so we had to give it a try. Decided on a 14\" pizza (classic crust) with half pepperoni/half cheese and the boneless wings (6 BBQ, 6 honey BBQ). Was surprised when they dropped off some garlic bread with marinara. I guess it came with the meal! It was good too... soft dough. The wings tasted just like Pizza Hut. Nothing special. Didn't care for the honey BBQ but the BBQ was better. The pizza was pretty good and our server was very nice."}
{"text":"This place has quick become my go to comfort food capital. The menu is diverse, taste is classic and delivery is quick. 

It has a family owned feel that I like.

Only suggestions would be a larger bar inside the actual restaurant and tiramisu on the menu."}
{"text":"Why are the people who work here always so rude? I like the food and it's close to my house but the way you are treated is not worth it. No matter whether you order online, pick up, or dine in, they always have an attitude. I wish I could say it was only one or two people but it seems to be everyone who works there. I've finally learned my lesson and decided it wasn't worth the hassle, and struggle they make you deal with to order a slice of pizza. Try another location or oreganos which has far better food and customer service."}
{"text":"If it weren't for the food, Streets of New York would have received a one-star review because the customer service is god awful. Our waitress was as useless as a fish out of water. She was an older gal with dark hair and a chip on her shoulder. We overheard a shorter waitress tell what I assumed was a \"regular\" customer that the area we had sat in was the \"shitty waitress section\". Go figure. We got our beverages quick enough but had a hell of a time trying to get our hands on the advertised complimentary garlic bread on the menu. After taking our food order, this so-called waitress sat next to a \"regular\" customer and chatted him up, then baby sat 2 kids at another table across the room. These kids definitely belonged to one of the restaurant employees. When she finally brought the garlic bread, it was basically the snickle-fritz (crappy leftovers). She said \"This is what's left\". How about you just wait until fresh new bread comes out the oven and then serve me the good stuff, woman??

There was a young man who worked as the busser there, and he was busting his ass. He was basically picking up the slack of our waitress. Since our waitress was MIA, my husband had to go up to the bar and order a beer himself. On top of that, the menu advertises $2 bud light drafts during NFL games. Welp, there was a game on. The shorter waitress and the busser had no idea what he was talking about. But whatever, they figured it out and my husband got his $2 beer after much confusion.    

I ordered the Special Ziti Pasta ($11.25) sans the sausage and my better half ordered a calzone with pepperoni, sausage, and onions. Calzones start at $10.25 and each topping, besides the cheese and stuff, is an additional $0.70. Ouch. I was ready to dig in, but oh look honey, there's no silverware. The busser brought us our silverware and the garlic bread that our waitress failed to deliver. The food was pretty good, but bad service always outweighs the food in my opinion. 

Our waitress swung by and we ordered dessert, the passion cookie ($5.75). After putting in the order, she unceremoniously placed the tab on the table without a word. The Passion cookie was amazing, way better than BJ's signature poozookie dessert. Too bad I'll never taste that dessert again since I'm never coming back. 

The check put an even bigger damper on our mood. The bill came to $37, which is way too expensive for this type of establishment. It's just a local laid back pizzeria, nothing special. Seriously, where do you get off charging $2.90 for fountain drinks? If you want overpriced food and shitty service, eat at Streets. If you're smart, you'll just walk past this pretentious restaurant and go to Leticia's instead."}
{"text":"DELIVERY BEWARE!!! I should have read the reviews before ordering delivery.  1 hour and 45 minutes... literally, not exaggerating.  When I called at 1 hour 10 minutes they said the driver is in the area and will be 5 minutes... 30 minutes later he showed up.  Pizza was ice cold and hard.  Had to put it in the microwave to heat it up. Come onnnnnnn!!  Figure your delivery out or don't offer it cause paying a premium for ice cold pizza is rediclous."}
{"text":"Great little place. Really good food. Must try the pizzas. Great ambience and music. Nothing really matches and that's so cool. Looks and feels clean and well maintained."}
{"text":"6/10/2018 5-7pm

We ordered off the Yelp app and requested no sauce or olives. Guess what we got? Olives and sauce. When we requested they make another they said they would have to charge us saying Yelp didn't tell them our custom order YET they split the pizza how we requested in the same 'notes' section. 

Terrible experience and terrible tasting pizza and wing. Honey mild wings were drowned in a goo that made them slimy....."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in years, but decided to revisit.

Service was slow - took forever to get someone to even approach the table and the place was not crowded at all.

Food was fair at best.  My son's chicken parm was not warm throughout and had to be taken back.  Pasta dishes were ok, but nothing to write home about...sauces were lacking.  There are much better places.

Sorry, gotta tell it like it is.  We won't be going back.  It's a shame because they could really play off of the 'authentic' Italian thing, but it's just not happening.  The best thing we enjoyed about our visit was the warm breadsticks with marinara."}
{"text":"Last week- I have eat here once befor and it was exceptional
Great food awsome flavor and nice staff. I thought coming back to this amazing place would be a good idea but boy was I wrong. The women. Who took my order was not professional, friendly or helpfull. I ordered a pizza with BBQ sauce, cheese, pinapple, jalapeños, bacon, sausage and ham. I was wanting a sweat and spicy pizza. That's not what I received. They completely forgot the ham and took it apon them self to add mushrooms and zucchini. With those two added food items it through off the whole taste of the pizza. I could only have a few bits before I throw my slices away. I ordered this pizza four my office. I was ranting ans raving about how fantastic your pizza is. Every one was wanting Me to order from giant rustic pizza but I convince them streets of new York was better. We all were let down. I nor any CO workers will be ordering from you."}
{"text":"Yummy food, both pizzas and other entrees. The best antipasto salad anywhere. Consistently excellent professional service. Very pleasant atmosphere. A real favorite place for us."}
{"text":"Love the lunch specials here and the options are almost limitless. The Caesar salad and pizza slice combo is my favorite. I end up here frequently for work luncheons and the staff is always spot on for service. Never disappointed when I come here."}
{"text":"I really like their food--the cheese steak is excellent--but I have had *nothing* but trouble with their takeout. Dining in is better.

The key to takeout is to take the order correctly, fill the order correctly, and have it up when you say you will. They have messed up each part of that equation and consistently failed in filling my orders. I now avoid getting takeout from this location because I have been burnt four times.

They did get the order correct once. I laboriously inspected each and every item to confirm that it was as I expected. The cashier asked if everything was okay and I explained my plight. She said that she'd put a credit on the account for the sandwich that they consistently got wrong and I left in good spirits. They had not only gotten the order right (slightly later than expected but I can forgive them that) but they actually practiced some Customer Service!

My elation was short-lived. They messed up the order on the next visit and my claiming of the credit was thwarted because no credit was actually applied. Nevermore."}
{"text":"Love the service and food here! Been coming here for awhile and the atmosphere is great. Especially a nice cool night to enjoy their patio with the great lights! 
FYI, Ignore the map directions just use the address! 
This is located in the North West"}
{"text":"Leah and Brittney were awesome!!! Very friendly and attentive. This was my first time here and they made an outstanding impression. I will certainly be back because of them!!! KEEP THEM AROUND!!!"}
{"text":"Today I stopped in the local Streets of New York for lunch and I had the \"make your own pasta\" (lunch portion). The sauce was great as always but the pasta was very soft and falling apart (I had penne pasta), certainly far from al dente. The meatballs were lukewarm inside. This is not the quality I've had in the past from this location. I know management has changed over the past year or two. Two years ago I would have the same dish and garlic bread was served with the dish. No more. Garlic bread is now a side dish which is extra. During the preparation of my meal I could hear the \"cook\" asking the waitress about my meal as if he didn't know how to prepare it. The waitress never asked me if I'm enjoying my meal or the quality of the meal. I'm sorry to say that I won't be back to this location for awhile. If you want authentic Italian, go a half mile south to Andreoli's."}
{"text":"The food was delivered promptly for it being the middle of their lunch rush. Food was warm and the meatball sub was really good! Will definitely be ordering from here again in the future."}
{"text":"I recently discovered the Bruchetta appetizer and I was so disappointed they didn't have any available today.  Boo!  At the server's suggestion I tried the Spinach artichoke .  It's delicious."}
{"text":"I feel like this should really be a three and a half star review.  Tried this place for the first time and the pizza was good, antipasto salad was good, even the house red wine was good.  My baked ziti was nothing special though and our server got stuck on a really long phone order which delayed our ability to order. Would have been nice if another server had stepped in to help. Overall though, I'm sure we will be back."}
{"text":"Wanted to try a new pizza place so we decided to give this place a try. We ordered a delivery order for a create your own (16\"\") pizza with meatball and pepperoni. The total came to $21.20 before tax and delivery. The driver was pleasant and the pizza arrived at the estimated time. The pizza tasted okay, but it was not worth the amount paid in my opinion. With so many pizza places to choose from in the valley this one unfortunately did not stand out."}
{"text":"Had a good time we had beer and pizza, not overly busy when we were there."}
{"text":"Great gluten free pizza and wings!"}
{"text":"Why this place isn't packed I have no idea. We as Asa family. love this place. Never a let down. Service is great. People are friendly. Pizza is top 5 in vegas. I like it better then almost all places I can think of. The portion of food is more then enough. Salads are fresh. Garlic knots my kids are in love with. This place should be packed 4 days a week. Show the love. Plus $6 for a large mug of beer, peroni at that! Great temp on draft with perfect head. Can't say enough good things!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was clean, my waitress was super nice, professional and checked back with me several times. The pizza was great: crispy crust, no overdone spots, & a lot of cheese and sausage. Compared to their other locations, this one has a smaller seating area & has a large bar area. (See photo.)

I brought home a pizza slice and followed the re-heating directions on their box. It was 2 days later, and the pizza slice was perfect. (See photo.)"}
{"text":"Honestly the worst delivery experience ever. We ordered a large gluten free pizza with no onions and extra sides of ranch, they called back and said they couldn't do large.. so they were going to give me one small and one medium. I said that's totally fine.  

We wait 45 minutes, get our pizza and it's loaded with onions (which I'm allergic to) and get NO ranch. 

I call the location and ask what can be done and she says \"if you want a new pizza, we can send one out\" with a huge attitude. She said she has to wait for the delivery guy to get back to figure it out. 

SO strange that a restaurant wouldn't want to fix this situation asap. 

Won't be ordering from here again.

We have been waiting 1.5 hours now for our replacement pizza... still waiting."}
{"text":"My husband has been telling me about this place for at least a month.  Having been tricked by the signs for at least that long now, if not longer, he thought it was open a couple of weeks ago and swung by on his lunch break to grab a few slices.  Sadly, the wait continued.  

Today we went for the first time at lunchtime.  The place was completely empty except for us and we were able to seat ourselves.  Plenty of seating, both tables and booths.  There are some flat screen tv's in the middle of the dining room.  Overall, decor was very nice and the place is spotless.  

We were greeted with smiles by the staff and immediately a waitress in training came over with her trainer to give menus and take our drink order.  

I tried 2 plain cheese slices and my husband had cheese ravioli with bolognese.  Before getting our meal we were given complimentary bread sticks, which were warm but a bit \"chewy\".  The marinara dipping sauce seemed typical but good.  

My husband enjoyed his ravioli and, for $8.95, it was a pretty decent sized portion.  As for the slices... well I expected to be more impressed by a place with \"New York\" in the name.  At the risk of sounding harsh, they were really no better than something I'd find at pizza hut, except maybe that the crust was a \"crust above\".  The slice was thicker than I'd hoped and there was this overly thick layer of cheese.  Definitely failed the cheese to sauce ratio that is so important to a slice of NY pizza.  The sauce was bland.  

I had an issue where they refilled my soda and it was just a watered down version of Coke.  I told my waitress and she apologized and offered to get me a new one, so no problem there.  But we were already out the door.  

Overall, solid service, nice decor, just OK food."}
{"text":"Never been disappointed at this place. Always nice friendly staff. Food is delicious . The only minus the restrooms r outside. But u don't have to go there all the time. Lol. U r coming for great pizza and calzone . Will recommend . And coming often myself."}
{"text":"Streets knocks it out of the park again!
Stopped in for an order to go this afternoon,
and was helped by Debby.  The service provided by her was awesome!  Mark and Ginger sure find some great folks for their award winning restaurant. I ordered angel hair pasta with chicken, and Vegetables, tossed in olive oil. My second order was spaghetti and meatballs. Both dishes were done to perfection 
(as usual), and were delicious. Debby also offered me an iced tea to enjoy while waiting,
as well as some passion bread. My iced tea didn't hardly go down in the cup before she was refilling it!
Debby, and everyone at the restaurant always make our visit a real pleasure, as do the delivery folks that have been to our place many times since 2011. They ALL aim to please, and go out of their way to please their customers.
Mike and Jan......."}
{"text":"They said 45 mins for delivery and it took 1 hour and 45 minutes. Not enough staff. Poor service. Pizza looked good but was cold.

Would recommend trying someplace else."}
{"text":"We wrote a review based on OUR experience, we would appreciate no further contact from your company. Honestly, had we talked with neighbors, coworkers, even a cashier at the local grocery store. We'd of known... It's been a learning lesson... Thank you"}
{"text":"I forgot how much I loved this place. It's been about 4 years since I've eaten here and I fell in love all over again. Ugh their calzones are one of my favorites and the pizza is top 3 for my top pizza places. The pricing isn't soooooo bad. Definitely a little costly but worth it. I've tried a pizza place around me that just doesn't compare. I rather wait a little longer for great food rather than getting from somewhere because they deliver a lot quicker."}
{"text":"I'm not going to give the one star review I feel was fair because the service and server were great and the pizza was good! What changed is the cheesesteak. I haven't ordered a cheesesteak at SoNY for a couple years and the cheesesteak totally disappointed!! It has changed DRASTICALLY and not for the better!!!

My hubby and I used to LOVE the cheesesteak at SoNY!!!! IF we go back, we will stick with the pizza. Come on, SoNY, get back to the goodness I have come to expect from the cheesesteak!!! WTH???"}
{"text":"Zoey was a great help but the food quality for the price is crazy. I paid 41$ for a 16\" pizza and 12 wings and it is horrible. Good staff is saving them because their food isnt"}
{"text":"The pizza is actually good and the service is fine when you eat there; however, their diligence with take-out orders is extremely poor. The first mistake we encountered was them not having the pizza ready for pick-up and we figured that sometimes things happen. The server wasn't too friendly about it which raised some eyebrows. We decided to try again and chalked it up to a bad day because our dine-in experience had been great. However, the same problem happened again and they were quite rude about it. The pizza hadn't even been made yet and they proceeded to tell my wife it would just be 5 minutes as she watched them start from scratch. When she confronted them about it the kid just rolled his eyes and ignored her. My wife came home and called to speak to the manager and they put her on hold and never picked up. She then contacted their corporate office and received no reply. I like their pizza, but not their take-out service; they are mostly rude and because of this we will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place is a bit unprofessional. We never get out order right. We use them as delivery most of the time. I usually venture to Anthem to get it right."}
{"text":"I was on a date with my husband on Saturday evening, having a wonderful time.  We stopped in at Streets of New York on Ray Rd. in Chandler, and I ordered a bowl of the Italian wedding soup.  It tasted great, and I ate about half of it when I noticed ... a fly in my soup!

The waitress deducted the cost of the soup but I went outside and threw up!  I'll never eat there again!"}
{"text":"I'm a broasted chicken Fanatic. Normally you only find broasted chicken in the Midwest. When I found out that the streets of New York, a pizza company, had broasted chicken, I had to try it! This broasted chicken gets five stars. They make it to order. It's juicy on the inside crispy on the outside, really The skin is blistered, crunchy. If you're in the area you must try streets of New York. Skip the pizza, go for the chicken. Service was great, the restaurant was clean, and the food was amazing."}
{"text":"For all you broasted chicken fans out there this is the place! If you're anyone like me who thinks broasted chicken is to die for its here. I'm from the Midwest and was raised on broasted chicken and can never find it in Arizona. When we pulled up at the suggestion of a friend and I saw the sign I was in love. The chicken was extra crispy and super hot! Yes it does take a little longer to get it because they obviously cooked it to order. They should really consider advertising this chicken. The salad was also amazing it had radishes cucumbers different types of lettuce cilantro, etc. It also was topped with an Italian seasoning that was really really good. We were also served breadsticks with marinara sauce that was totally unexpected. I will definitely be back and most likely become a regular."}
{"text":"Just had lunch. Great service, great food, then we paid
 As we were getting up from the bar, we noticed a dog behind the bar. Then a cook came out to give hi. We a treat and returned to the kitchen. That was our last visit there"}
{"text":"The place is located in what reminds me of a place bankers like to socialize after work. The street that they created gives somewhat of an outdoor bar hop vibe.. but its design is just a facade. This creates a less than friendly park experience as there is no real parking area unless you get lucky and get a curb spot. 
Now on to the actual restaurant. The overall interior design is fairly nice. Its clean and give off a upscale pizza vibe. The pizza on the other hand while being fair at best is priced way too high for the size and quality you are receiving. I tried the \"Pigged Out Pie\" which is basically a basic pizza with pork related toppings. Overall I would give it a 4/10.. it was good, but not worth the price. The pizza was 14.99 and that was only a 10 inch pie and was labeled as large, the traditional large at a good pizza place is 16'. We ordered the chicken fingers which were actually pretty good even though the chicken fingers were small.. the order was 8.95 and only came with chicken fingers.. No celery, carrots, blue cheese, ranch, fries, bread or anything else that would make the order a more complete package. The flavor of the fingers were good though. We also ordered the Beer Cheese Bread which is just bread knots and a bowl of beer cheese.. this was delicious and only costs 5.95. More surprising is the bread is all you can eat so for value and flavor, I see this as the only reason to come here and order something. I did not try any alcohol but the place does have a bar, although a very small bar. 
I would give this place a pass and save some money and go to a better pizza place if pizza is what you're looking for."}
{"text":"This is a loooong overdue yelp. (Sorry streets from a busy momma.)

We first ordered streets when we had a bogo coupon from valpack. What's there to lose? Well we didn't lose but gained an awesome Italian joint in our neighborhood!
We catered with them (pizza and wings) for my sons first birthday party and once again streets delivered! Our guests were raving about the food! My mother (born and raised in upstate NY) said \"tastes like home\"! They even let us rent the bags to keep the pizza warm, and return them after the party was over. How awesome is that!?

Great customer service! Awesome pizza! 
Give em a try! You wont be sorry!"}
{"text":"Very poor customer service . Asked for a refill several times . Never got one. The pizza was burnt to a crisp . I am very dissatisfied with the location. Will no longer  be returning ."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. I tried to place an order, giving them a chance after their last fuck up, but I find out they don't even deliver between 1400-1600. When I called to place an order the man on the phone was very rude and condescending while informing me of this, will never order from this place again! STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"The antipasto salad was fresh, crunchy and delicious. The pizza was pretty tasty as well. I like the amount of crispness present with a decent amount of dough. The toppings were fresh as well. The kids had the chicken fingers and fries, which were delicious! The breading on the chicken fingers was sweet and crunchy. 

The service could have been better, although we went on a busy Friday night. I just hate hate hate having to wait for my check. We ended up getting up and asking for it, since our waitress was MIA. I didn't get one refill on my iced tea either. Minus 1 star! 

The price is also ridiculous for the food. Our bill for a salad, garlic bread, 2 kids entrees, beverages and a pizza came to $80 without tip. Minus another star!! 

I probably won't return even though I love the location and its proximity to my parents house."}
{"text":"My husband and I got takeout last week... Decided to try something new. We ordered the meatball appetizer and got a meatball sub...meatballs did not taste or look homemade. Pizza crust was too chewy...also did not taste fresh. Lots of good choices in N Las Vegas --this isn't one..."}
{"text":"Ordered the Broaster chicken and small salad.  The salad came out first. I waited a bit and then asked the server when it might be ready.  She said she should have told me that it's cooked fresh and takes 15 minutes.  When she brought the chicken it was overcooked and kind of dry.  I wouldn't order it again."}
{"text":"I guess my taste buds have changed.  The pizza and wings weren't as good as I remembered.  I haven't been to a Streets of New York in about 4-5 years.  The pizza dough seemed dry and frozen.  Like a frozen pizza you would buy at a grocery store."}
{"text":"For being prime time lunch hour - very quiet and clean place. The server was outstanding and the lunch special prices were very reasonable. Definitely will come back again. The slices were a thin crust but had excellent flavor and presentation."}
{"text":"I went in for lunch with my husband,  and 3 daughters.  The waitress told us to pick a table.  We wait 15 minutes before he walked out. We didn't even get a menu. The worst part is that a larger party came in after us, and they got service. When we left we saw the waitress out side on her cell phone,  on a personal call. Never going back."}
{"text":"We tried this place out for this first time today and were very please with everything ! We ordered online and paid with our credit card.. Our delivery time was one hour from when we placed the order. They arrived in 35 minutes later.. GREAT timing! We ordered 24 wings..honey bbq and hot honey and the spinach and artichoke dip with the flat bread. Everything was fresh and hot and very tasty. My husband has fell in love with the wings.. So we will definitely order again soon!"}
{"text":"First time in. Service was great. Price wasn't bad. Food was good.  For some reason something felt chewy a bit which may be the cheese or I was just not feeling it. But all in all would come back again for beer and pizza."}
{"text":"Amazing Pizza that correlates with the cost. You're whole party will know why you spent the extra money the second the pizza reeks your house with that distinct smell.

Pricey? Oh Yeah
Deliciousness? VERRY High"}
{"text":"Streets of NY is an easy-going restaurant, with an interestingly old interior design that is both charming and needs an update.

I was fond of this pizza place as a younger child, and I enjoy items beyond their pizza such as their No. 7 Italian su with thin shredded lettuce and vinaigrette. While I have no complaints with my most recent visit as far as the food goes, I cant help but think the location would benefit immensely from a remodel.

Visiting from out of state, my family and I make an effort to relive our loyalty to Street of NY by always dining here."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch the other day and the place was bumping. Our poor server was very overwhelmed but he was doing a great job of managing everyone. We hadn't been here in a while and I forgot how good their pizza was."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and I'll keep this short and sweet. The service is horrible but the pizza has been great!!  Nice atmosphere and I've never waited to get a table. But beware of the service. Hopefully in time they will hire people who care."}
{"text":"Loved their pizza. Me and my sister came in and we got the lunch special a 10\" pizza which wasn't pricy and later on I just wanted more. Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Well it's starting off poorly. It's 4:30 in the afternoon on a Friday. Came here specifically for the Broasted Chicken. Ordered the chicken the waitress come back to tell us they are out of chicken... Are you kiddin me! Then after looking at other reviews I find out they do have a children's menu after already ordering an adults meal for a 4 year old. There is a whole lot of people standing around doing nothing! The bread sticks they brought to the table were cold and old. The sauce to dip them in is so thin it won't even coat the bread. The chicken they did... All of it was hot, some of it was so dry you could barely swallow it. It was almost as it it was reheated or or way over cooked. I love Broasted Chicken and will drive a long ways to get it. Next time I will drive to another location to give it a try!"}
{"text":"As far as the chain pizza places are concerned this is definitely one of the best. It's not gourmet but it's definitely same tasty pizza. Quick, easy and hits the spot. Plus, Yelp cash back makes that choice really a no brainer... as if anyone needed another reason to eat pizza."}
{"text":"I went back to have my favorite sausage sandwich, and it looks as though they reduced the size of the sandwich significantly. I have eaten many sausage sandwiches here and they usually give one and a half a large sausages per sandwich.(3 halves), but the sandwich that I got had barely 1 medium sized sausage. What a shame, I guess I will have to look for another place to get my sausage sandwich. Bummer"}
{"text":"5 Stars for service, Paolo was super amazing.  Because we had just hiked we sat outside and she quickly turned on the misters so we would be cooler in this Arizona summer heat.  We told her our order, and she was back in no time with our beverage order and not long our Salad was out and she split them for us.  The salad was fresh and perfect for after Hike Meal."}
{"text":"amazing food and place to hang out! best food and service! love their wings.."}
{"text":"Ordered Med Pizza for pick up.  It was fresh, ready to go and done almost as ordered.  Asked for extra sauce & well done, they got half that correct so they get 4 stars instead of 5.  Really like their sauce.  Guy that checked me out ran around the counter to hold door open for me which was pleasantly unexpected.  Price for med w/ 2 toppings was about $19 after tax. We'll be back again."}
{"text":"Just Ok. The speed of Delivery was good. The Pizza Crust was sub-par. The Pizzas (for New York Style) used far too much Cheese. The Salads were not very fresh."}
{"text":"My Fiance and I were in Phoenix for the weekend and had just arrived after traveling from Tucson Friday evening. We were starving, it was nearly 8:30 and we wanted something quick. We just happened to be driving down the road and saw the sign for Streets of New York. 

It is a quaint, quiet, unassuming restaurant. We were told to seat ourselves, and were immediately addressed. We absolutely LOVE white cheese pizza, which they happened to have on the menu. We ordered a medium, as well as the spinach and artichoke appetizer (recommended by our WONDERFUL waiter, whose name I cannot remember, sorry!!) The spinach dip was SERIOUSLY awesome - we could NOT stop eating it. The bread that came with it?! Amazing! The pizza came shortly after the appetizer, and that too was very good.

The service rocked, the food was amazing, and they had Octoberfest on Tap - what's not to like?!"}
{"text":"I have given this restaurant so many chances. Since it opened up I think I've been there about 10 times. As time went on, the staff became more and more lax. Everytime I walk into this restaurant, it seems as though they don't want me there. The owner is always sitting around doing paperwork at one of the tables. She throws the menus on the table and says your waiter will be with you. Although the restaurant was completely empty tonight, we still had trouble getting refills on our drinks. At the end of the meal I got a whopping $60 bill. I feel slighted because I had poor service and mediocre food. The only reason I go to this restaurant every once in awhile is because Metro pizza is too full. I don't recommend this restaurant to anybody and hope they go out of business so we can get somebody else with better food and service in there."}
{"text":"Great and friendly service from Zachary and Samantha.  I had the lunch special which was a 1/2 sandwich and salad. Food was great and delivered quickly. They also serve breadsticks with the lunch."}
{"text":"Well I am not a huge fan of Streets of New York but this experience was just horrible.  I was with some friends after hiking and went to Streets of New York to grab a bite to eat as none of us had dinner before the hike.  We ordered wings and pizza to all share as none of us had huge appetites after hiking.

First our drinks took way too long to get and then refills were almost so bad I was going to go refill them myself.  The food was very sub par for Streets Of New York.  I don't think I will be back to this location and I am not the only one as a Friday night it was pretty empty."}
{"text":"This place is really good. The only thing I didn't like was the 2 times I ordered artichoke dip it was sitting in a giant puddle  of grease or oil or something."}
{"text":"Great food. Great staff. Everyone is welcoming and friendly. The food is amazing and I'm super picky so that means a lot coming from me. Good happy hour specials. If you are looking for something fun to do on a Monday night they host trivia, we usually lose but it' still something fun to do with our friends! They have the NFL package so go watch foodball and enjoy some beer and wings.The passion cookies are delicious and necessary to have after a few slices of pizza. Everyone should try Streets!"}
{"text":"The pizza is ok here - not great, but ok.  But their antipasto salad is great!  Lots of olives, peppers and fresh greens - not just iceberg!  Their house dressing is a great Italian vinagrette too!"}
{"text":"Every time I drive by Phoenix,  I try to stop by and get me some Streets of New York pizza.  Love me some of that.  So  good.  I wish there was one in LA and I wish there was one in El Paso.  

I could just see it now.  Get a few pitchers of beer, have some of their bangin wings and finish it off with a large pizza (pepperoni & sundried tomatoes and extra sauce please).  Then again, I'd probably be 400 lbs.  by now if it was here.

I wonder what their other food items are like?  I've had their pasta once too.  I dont remember what it was, maybe some sort of alfredo,  I just remember really liking that as well.  

I'm  not sure what it is, that I love about their pizza.  I think it's just a good combination of bread sauce and cheese.  Maybe,  it's part of my psychosis where when I first lived in Phoenix,  I was generally too poor to eat there often so it became this sort of luxury and a symbol of success every time I eat it.

It can't be that bad.  There's a shit load of them now since I've returned to phoenix.  Before, I only knew about only one or two.  I hope they haven't gotten so big that they have to cut corners on their recipes to keep up on the profits.  That would suck and I think a lot of franchises yield to that practice and just get shittier through the years.  
Well, the last time I had it was over xmas break and it was still bangin so keep it up, Streets of New York.  You'll be seeing me again next road trip home."}
{"text":"I do not understand what is so incredibly difficult about getting an order right..."}
{"text":"Excellently burnt crust with little toppings. What a wonderful way to spend $20. I think I'll skip this place next time and get a pizza from a national chain. At least they don't burn their pizzas or skimp on toppings. :^)"}
{"text":"Well I'm from out of town and so far love how nice everyone has been here in town...until we came here to streets of new York pizza...service was horrible lady was very rude...basically slammed the waters down on the table almost 15 mins later and forgot the lemon too..and after slamming the water on the table and getting my father in law wet, he asked for a rag to wipe up the table and his shirt and she replied it's only water...I would not come here again let alone reccomend this place to any one...not to mention it's way to dark cant even read the menu. Future advice have more than 1 server at lunch time! Oh and instead of getting caesar dressing on our salads we got Italian dressing with parmesan cheese."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming to this particular location for years.  Never have be been disappointed until now. 

First, our beers were delayed in delivery, then we sent back our wings because they were delivered  cold and dry.  When the manager delivered  the new wings he forgot the dipping sauce and never apologized for them being served cold.  

As a matter of fact the manager never spoke to any customers the entire time we were there.  We did see him holding court at the bar with another employees.

The place was very empty for a Thursday night with football on during snowbird season. That being said it would have been the perfect time to be mentoring our server. And insuring everyone was happy.  

Our server Graciela was very nice and kind.  But it was painfully apparent she was in need of more training.  I don't blame her for our experience.  I blame the management.  The manager on duty was Donnie, i was informed the he was a manager in training.  So once again management has failed to set the standard and mentor their employees to insure success."}
{"text":"Been a customer of this location for many years. Visited this location with our family tonight. When our pizza arrived it was literally dripping with grease. The grease was pooled on top, but all the way through the crust onto the bottom of the pan. When I asked the server what was up, I showed him the grease. He brought the \"serving manager\" to our table. She agreed it was excessively greasy, apologized and said she would have a new one made right away. 10 minutes later, she had the audacity to bring back the EXACT SAME pizza telling us she had it put back in the over to cook more (REALLY??!! It was ALREADY well done upon delivery!). We were flabbergasted, as she did the exact opposite of what she said she would do. What shocked me even more was that she thought we were stupid enough to believe her! It was clear that they had just patted down our pizza in the kitchen to make it appear less greasy for 10 minutes....ARE YOU KIDDING ME?? You man handle our pizza for 10 minutes and then have the audacity to think we will eat it??  When I refused the pizza, she matter of factly took it back giving me no option for a fresh pizza. WHAT?! Food handlers 101 obliviously never happened for this \"serving manager\". The location manager then came to our table to try and pacify me and actually admitted what the serving manager had done. She admitted it was a horrible thing to do and wanted to get us something else....Ummmm, NO THANK YOU!! So thay can manhandle that too??!! Yuck!! Shame on you Streets!! The Board of Heath will be notified!"}
{"text":"The staff here is always so nice and helpful! Support your local college student and ask for Austin at the bar, he's awesome! He pours a mean glass of cabernet.  Also, if you haven't tried the broasted chicken you haven't lived. Plain and simple."}
{"text":"The Chicken wings were good, but their pasta had very little taste.  The sauces were like water.  The service was great but next time my wife and I will try their pizza.  I think the cook is bored in back and just throws out the dishes and needs better ingredients to work with.  Next time I'll spend my $33 on a large pizza and a large beer instead."}
{"text":"My family and I stopped in for dinner this evening. We ordered two pizzas and a few appetizers. The service was horrendous.  I had to leave early so I asked to have salad to go and was given a rude nod. No direct words were spoken to me the few times I did engage our server. The restaurant had a only a few tables so I'm not sure if take out orders were delaying them but she quickly brushed our table to the side. My family's pizza arrived just before I left, when we ask if it was the pepperoni pizza she looks at it and says\" i think so\" then quickly hurried away. The service I can ignore what I can not ignore is what I discovered in my salad. Two bites into my salad I discovered a fly. I am so appalled that I do not have words. I will never return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza for pickup for dinner with my parents.  Good customer service, but we were not that impressed with the pizza.  The toppings were pretty good, but the crust was so dry!  Now we did try the thin and cripsy crust, so I guess that's on us, but I really do not recommend that style of crust unless you want a cracker crust."}
{"text":"It was a long long wait for our app.  ANd, we ordered a pizza and hte app came out like 2 min before.

Food was good would try again."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times as the husband works in the vicinity. The first couple times I ordered to-go. The 3rd time a family member was in town with pizza on her mind for lunch...and since we were planning to meet the hubs for lunch might as well dine-in. The first couple times in, I stood there waiting to be helped as this one waitress at he time stood talking with a bunch of guys who were seated at a table. She almost looked dang near disturbed that I was standing there. Then I realized, you seat yourself. However, I'm not going to sit down and expect to be helped especially for a to-go order. What's bad...this literally happened both times. Her smiling face chatting up certainly didn't follow with her when she walked over to help me.

Choosing to dine-in was a little hard for me to do. Fam in town, pizza on zee mind, walking distance, lunch...okay let's go. Service was the SAME! I tried giving excuses the first couple times...but the very same lady (could be part owner idk) seemed like we were an inconvenience. She wasn't chipper nor welcoming, really. 

We have ordered wings, street fries, the new york combo pizza, a bruschetta, and the meatball sub...collectively. I thought the wings were pretty good, but everything else...pretty average. The food wasn't exciting, kind of like the service. Dining in there was 1 older gent, a family of 3, and us. Getting checked on, refills, was like a deep sigh and a mission. Why do we have to wave a flag to be seen? I honestly wanted to love this place, but for the value and the service...it isn't even worthed. It's hard to support a business that feels like they don't value each customer.

It's just disappointing businesses whether it'd be the owners or workers itself...fail to take the time in properly greeting and treating their customers to a certain level. I'm not talking about butt kissing or overly attentive...I'm just saying basic customer, GENUINE service. A lot of times the food could taste greater if the experience was great. Each time in...the place felt like a dead spirit. Something tells me if you are a regular you'll certainly have a bipolar experience and perspective.

3 times is enough even though I'm in the area often enough. Never again.

Definitely kid and stroller friendly. I'm not saying don't give it a try as my experience is mine...but hopefully you'll have a better one. 2 stars for having a lot of tables available and the food being ahhh-ite. I suppose that warrants 2 stars, aye.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"WOW!! I'm just so disappointed My relationship with Streets of New York started 30 years ago!! Loved their location at 44th and CamelbackThen we relocated to the north valley and started going to their Tatum and Greenway location all was good temporarily but didn't stay that way we quit going for 10 years!! Decided to try them again a few years ago and things were good again (temporarily)Now I'm bummed because this time there is no going backThey have lost our business for good ! Maybe pay more for competent staff."}
{"text":"Initial review:  Just moved from NYC and dying for a nice huge cheese pizza delivered.  Came close here and we've ordered 3 times.  Super fast (30mins usually and delivery guy remembered us and was very friendly.  If you're craving what your're missing, Streets of NY is a good start.  Not perfect but BEATS Domino's and some other NY style places.  Thanks a lot and definitely recommended.

Update: Definitely not after tonight.  After 7 pizzas, they missed a delivery and when I called, they apparently don't have me in their system.  Asked for my last name and gave it.  \"What?\"  \"The first 4 letters in a common name.\"  \"Oh.  Well, there is no one by that name\" and no record of my order and when I asked for a manager, none was \"available.\"  Really?  I'll get a refund through GrubHub but I can now see that anyone who is used to this place rates it so low.  This is a chain that is obviously way too comfortable in their skin, accepts marginal service, and doesn't need to retain their client base.  So, I just would not order again."}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious and the chicken is to die for! Our waiter was awesome and even changed the TV so we could watch the game. Excellent customer service and yummy food. We will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"A perfect Sunday night consists of Streets of New York Hawaiian Pizza + My Couch + A Bottle of Red. 

Now, I'm drooling and it's only Tuesday. There's something about their pizza that is perfect. The consistency, the thickness/thiness of the crust and the flavors of the ham and pineapple. I love it. Plus, their ranch and peppers for dipping and extra sin are the way to go. 

Be sure to look in those cheesy coupon packets that come in the mail - Streets of NY typically has good coupons which help. They're a tad expensive but so worth it. I think the 18\" Hawaiian (don't judge us) is $23."}
{"text":"Broaster chicken!! Let me say that again... Broaster chicken!! Get it and you'll be glad you did. Try the Yelp check in deal...so worth it. 

They also have good pizza and a variety of tasty Italian.  Did I mention how good the Broaster Chicken is? Just saying. Wow"}
{"text":"Went here for a family dinner with two young kids under age 5. Eating out with kids is hard, but we are polite, we tip extra just because our kids can be loud sometimes, we clean the floor when we're done, and wipe up any messes before leaving. Our youngest started getting a little anxious to leave as we were waiting quite awhile to receive the check and then have it picked up to have the card charged. Instead of clearing dirty plates and the pizza tray he just stared at us as we tried to keep our son from pulling things off the table. First rule in the restaurant business: take trash or dirty dishes with you every time you visit the table, a clean uncluttered table is an easy way to keep the customer happy.Then as our son was getting loud our waiter stared at us and gave us dirty looks from behind the counter instead of coming over to see if our card was ready. We were one of two tables in the restaurant, the other filled table was on the opposite side of the place so I'm not sure why the waiter stared at us as if our child was throwing food at other diners. The pizza was greasy, the service was poor, we won't be back."}
{"text":"After recently moving back to the Valley after 5 years away, I was surprised to see a Streets of NY in north scottsdale. I had been a regular at the one in Tempe many years ago. I will give 1 star because the waitress was nice. The food on the other hand, absolutely atrocious! Spinach and artichoke dip was water, pure runny water with NO flavor. My fiancé had a piece of cake for desert and it was straight out of the freezer, with a nice cardboard flavor. I had a philly cheese steak, the meat was a bit of a grey color, but I thought maybe it was the cheese sauce that was on the meat. I ate half the sandwich, and took the other half home. Later that evening my fiancé became ill and the next morning I become ill. I looked at the sandwich that I had brought home and was now in the refrigerator. The meat was grey and looked horrible! It looked like boiled meat. Needless to say we will not be back! EVER!
Also, hotdog garlic bread?? Really??"}
{"text":"Walk into this very special Streets restaurant and immediately feel that warm, friendly ambiance. Owner, Robert, takes a personal interest in all the guests, from families with kids, to Rotary members, to local sports team sponsorships.
If you visit while Robert is there, he will very likely give your kids a complimentary chocolate chip cookie desert. The cookie is warmed up, chips melting in your mouth, paired with vanilla ice cream--this desert is unforgettable!
But back to the Italian food. Robert uses the highest quality cheeses which makes all the difference to what would otherwise be ordinary Italian fare. Being a gluten-free person, I especially like the eggplant rollatini, and the Greek salad is a great compliment.
The restaurant is well decorated, kept clean, and the staff goes the extra mile to make sure you are having a good experience. This is no ordinary franchise--your tastebuds will draw you back for a great meal at a reasonable price, with a warm, relaxed environment, tended to by an owner who really cares."}
{"text":"From time to time, my family enjoys a good pizza.  However, the gluten free options are very limited for my youngest son and myself.  We have ordered from Dominos, which is really gross.

Streets of New York was introduced to us about a year ago.  We have been back several times when we want to have a pizza treat.  We love the food.  

The only issue we have is the wait is often very long for our food and the wait staff seems is always a little on the blah side.  A smile, every once in awhile would be nice.  

We will continue to come back, but I would recommend the wait staff perk up a bit, often you look like you (all) hate being there."}
{"text":"Shocker this place closed!  This location was open for a long time and was great for a lot of it. I don't know if owners changed or what but it went downhill fast. The service got awful and the quality of the food got bad too. I would be sad that this location closed but I had already quit going to this location months before they shut the doors."}
{"text":"One of the better pizzas I've had in this area.  Ordered for delivery so I cannot speak to the quality of the restaurant itself.  As a Chicagoan who spent a lot of time on the East Coast I can definitely say I've had better elsewhere, but if you're here in Arizona the Streets of New York rises above much of the competition."}
{"text":"Came here with my mom and niece during happy hour. Ordered wings medium, bbq, parm, garlic cheese bread and fries. The wings were terrible! Dry, over cooked and tasted awful but we were so hungry we didn't complain cause service was Very slow. We've been here before and quality of food not good thought we'd give another chance. Definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner salad!!  I know that sounds strange but really their dinner salad has every veggie you can imagine in it...not just lettuce and tomatoes like most...great value and great portion size.  I'm super excited to try the broasted chicken breast...I've heard of the concept but this is the first time I'm actually seeing it on a menu...fun to find out they deliver to my house...yes I can get broasted chicken delivered to my house!!  Jason is a great server too...really took the time to explain the broasted chicken."}
{"text":"The food is okay. Since franchising they've lost the family look and feel. Not 100% cracked up with the changes to the menu.
The staff is normally very friendly and fast."}
{"text":"I like this place. I have gotten small pizzas from here before and they're pretty quick getting them ready and they're tasty."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza!. Just the way it should be in New York. We ordered the combination that withheld the peppers. It was a great pizza.!"}
{"text":"Aside from the meal being very overpriced for what it was. Our table was DISGUSTING! Literally DISGUSTING  - black tar-like material on 75% of the table top. Not sure if it was rotten dressing or if someone had changed their oil on top of it. Nonetheless, it was very dirty and sticky. Word of advise: Do not wait until the last minute to use the bathroom - Bathrooms are located OUTSIDE and do require a key. You literally have to chase down the waitress to get the key. The food is served at the cook's convenience which means that if you have a table of four - only one person is served their food first. God bless that person and be prepared to share your food, because the entire rest of the very hungry table will be asking/begging and dipping into your food because their food is still in the back getting prepared. When I asked why they only bring out one person's food - the answer was: because they bring it out as it is finished being prepared. (They don't hold anyone's food back so it can be served as a group.) By the way, the waitress, Misha was nice but we were the ONLY TABLE she had...she visited our table once thru the duration. Then we had to ask three times for a take home box.  Also, wooden chairs are very uncomfortable. The seating is very squeezed in. I won't be back."}
{"text":"My family and I love the Streets of New York. Everything we've tried on the menu hasn't disappointed us.
Plus they always get  our order correctly when we order delivery.
I little more pricey as pizza goes but I feel it's worth it."}
{"text":"I like their pizza, but they changed to a Pepsi place. Blech! I'll consider take out next time."}
{"text":"Came in at 6. Semi busy. Had the chicken parm with spaghetti. Carb load before pat's run. Bread was rock hard. Chicken was soggy due to the watery marinara sauce. I had to get another plate to pour the watery sauce off. I really wanted to like this place as its within walking distance ;("}
{"text":"I had an awesome slice of the new York combo minus the olives add jalapeños instead and my boyfriend had his own 10\" personal. The cheese was nice and gooey and the Pizza was flavorful. Also while waiting for our pizza they gave us free \"passion bread\" basically their versions of garlics knots. I really enjoyed this place. It's quick, easy and yummy."}
{"text":"Ok.. I used to love Street of NY pizza, but the last 4 times we have ordered from them it has been AWFUL!  The crust was like shoe leather tonight and hard to eat.  We ordered a thin crust when it first came out and that pizza was so gross we couldn't even eat it.  Another time they forgot about us and we had to call 1 1/2hr later to find out they forgot to put the order in.... this place SUCKS!!!! go to NYPD...always a great pizza every time!!!"}
{"text":"So pretty disappointed in my last visit , I usually order a small chopped anti pasta salad  to go , I called in and went to pick up the guy who took my order kept trying in wrong phone number and when I went to pick up I asked him why the salad was so much for a small ? He said oh you ordered a small That's my fault ? I was like ok but your not going to charge me for the full right ? He's like I have too ? I said why is that if it's your mistake ? He said we already made it said he felt bad I was like you should it's your fault but whatever and left since I was in a hurry. This place has good food but I find the service lacking big time :("}
{"text":"I don't know how many years I have been going to SONY, and I have never been disappointed. Sandwiches, pizzas, beverages are all delicious, have a great appearance and the prices are right. Love the people working there."}
{"text":"I like streets of new york. They have good food. Their prices arent too bad per person. The reastaurant is clean and so are the bathrooms.
Awesome service. They deliver. Theyre delicious."}
{"text":"They said it's best to take a drink order.The little breadsticks that they gave me a delicious jso soft and cheesy.wwdgy"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of NY style pizza (ok, I'm not a fan at all)... but I was pleasantly surprised by their pizza!  I mean, I'd still take a Chicago-style deep dish pizza over this any day of the week, but if I'm in the mood for thin crust pizza with a good combination of sauce, crust, and cheese, then I'll come back here!"}
{"text":"So I ordered a giant New York slice.  When the server sat my plate down I noticed two immediate problems.  It was not New York pizza and it most certainly was not giant.  It bothers me when like to add \"New York\" to their name.  I honestly would have just walked out, but my lady friend ordered pasta (also not good).  I would be willing to take a bet that no one there has even been to New York.  If anyone know where I can find a decent slice in this town, please let me know."}
{"text":"Pre-made crust? Are you kidding. It was like eating a cracker. Not a pizza crust. When I asked the waiter about the horrible crust, he smiled and said, \"yes, we use pre-made crusts for our crispy pizza....\" and walked away. No warnings when we ordered, nothing on the menu to share this important tid-bit. Don't name your store after New York when you serve \"store bought\" pizza crusts. We left hungry, and will not return. There was no effort to fix the situation, no apology, just business as usual. I can't think of a pizza that's further removed from new york style as this place."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised.  The pizza and Greek salad were excellent.  Service was a bit slow but I figured it would be since the place was packed.  They were very friendly.  I can not wait to go back and try some of the pasta dishes."}
{"text":"Ordered two medium Pizzas and 12 wings for pickup. Pizza was bad and wings were worse. Tasted like it had been sitting in a warner all day and the wings were over cooked and vinegary.  First and last time we try this streets of ny."}
{"text":"Took an hour to cook and deliver a 10\" pizza 4 miles away. I left very detailed delivery instructions online, but the delivery driver called me confused about where to go. I had to meet him downstairs to get the pizza. The pizza was cold and really chewy. It cost $23 for a small personal pizza including $3 delivery fee and $2 tip. First and last time I'll ever eat or order from here. Spinato's is way better, if you live in the area."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love pizza? Whether it's NY or Chicago Style, we as a whole, love it.

We have lived in Centennial Hills for 8 years and we have seen our fair share of pizza places come and go. Streets of NY has been there for a while and it was time we actually gotten a pie from them.

I called for a carry out order.
We always order a lot of food to get a gauge of how good it'll be.

We got a 16\" pizza, 12 piece boneless wings, a slice of chocolate cake, and their famous Broaster chicken. I used the yelp check in offer for a $5, 4 piece broaster meal which is normally $9. We were told it would take about 15-20 minutes for our order to be ready.

I got there about 15 minutes after I ordered and after I had paid was told they were out of chocolate cake. We opted for the cheesecake.

After about 10 more minutes of waiting I was finally on my way home.
 
The pizza we had ordered was a 16\" NY style pie. Ricotta cheese on the whole thing, half with pepperoni and jalapeños. The pizza came with ricotta, but the pepperoni and jalapeños were on the WHOLE pie. I called to let them know about the mistake and they offered to make a new one or give me a credit, I opted for the latter. 

The pizza looked good upon first look. We each grabbed a piece and started. Another issue. Mistakes get made, I understand, we probably eat hundreds of hairs or more in our food in our life, but I don't want to see them. A hair was found in the ricotta. The discovery made it hard to eat the rest of the pizza. 

Other than the mistakes on the pizza, overall the flavors were good. The crust was crispy and chewy, the way a pizza should be. The mozzarella was tasty and it wasn't a greasy pie. The ricotta was creamy and the pepperoni and jalapeños added a nice salt and spice. Overall 3.5/5

We had originally ordered the Honey Gold flavor, but were told they didn't have it. So we settled for the medium Buffalo sauce. The boneless wings were surprisingly well made. The medium Buffalo sauce had no trace of heat at all though, but the flavor was good. I assume if you want heat, order the Hot Buffalo.  Overall 3/5

The Broaster chicken looked dead on arrival. Probably one of the least appetizing, driest looking pieces of chicken I have ever seen. With that being said, upon tasting, it was better than it looked. Better than it looks doesn't mean it was good. The chicken wasn't dry, but it was bland. Very little, to no seasoning at all. Overall 2/5

The cheesecake was good, but it wasn't chocolate cake. It was a good old fashioned cheesecake. Creamy, tangy, sweet. Overall 3/5

Streets of NY is a decent pizza shop. The prices are a bit high, but it's a higher end chain. It's not anything I would go out of my way to get, but it wasn't too bad."}
{"text":"Son and i just finished 10\" traditional combo to go pizza and it was awesome tasting.  The crust was crispy on outside and soft inside ingrdients tasted fresh.  Tomato sauce was just right amount of sweetness and sourness.
Gone in a few minutes...should have ordered 14\".  While waited to take home to son and myself i had a nice cold brew.  Service was quick...it was 215pm on sat."}
{"text":"The food is great! The street fries were crunchy and  very nicely seasoned.  Staff is excellent especially Wendy, Heriberto, Elias, Elisa!"}
{"text":"Place was welcoming, clean, family friendly, and food was good. Husband ordered broiled chicken and I ordered a pizza."}
{"text":"Good pizza if you are a thin crust person like I am.  We did carry out. The staff was polite and the pizza was done when it was supposed to be. I'd go here often if I lived here. - just visiting!"}
{"text":"I don't see what all these bad reviews are about. I thought the pizza was tasty and fair priced. I got a lunch special of salad and a piece of pizza for about 6 bucks. Plus they gave our table an order of breadsticks with marinara sauce. This place isn't anything super special, but it's good pizza for lunch at least. The inside was bigger than it looks, and it was clean and comfortable. The service was good too."}
{"text":"I went here last night with my mom and her BF. I have been going to this location for a long time, and I'd say they're pretty consistent. The food is ok, I think their pizza is fine, but not wonderful... it could use more sauce. It's nice that they give out free garlic bread... definitely a plus. Last night I ordered a cup of minestrone soup and it was huge! not really a cup at all. I thought it was tasty though. The problem really is that the pizzas are super expensive and aren't that great. I'd definitely order that soup again though. So overall it was alright, it didn't blow my socks off, but it is a fine place to come eat.... especially at lunch time when you can get one of the well priced specials."}
{"text":"This is the Streets location closest to my house, but unfortunately it is very hit or miss. A few months ago I ordered a pizza online in the morning for this location and I went to pick it up at around 8:30pm, paid, and proceeded to sit there for about 45 minutes. I set the pizza to be picked up at 8:30.... WTF? Oh, they thought they put in my order but they didn't. Awesome. I do not know why they think I was sitting there.... In addition, I was not given any kind of discount for my trouble. So since then I have gotten take out from them a couple times which has been fairly good. 

Then, the BF and I went here the other day and ate in... we experienced TERRIBLE service, and I think it was one of the managers who was serving us... We were not given the complimentary bread.... then I saw that they brought out some fresh bread and I was going to ask for some, but I could not get the waitress to come over to save my life. I gave her eye contact on multiple occasions, but she was busy cleaning all the other tables and ignoring us. Finally, I asked a different waiter for some bread and it was about the same time we got our food. The waitress said that the bread just came out so.... but it didn't! I watched it come out (she put it out) at least 5 minutes earlier. We were sitting right next to it, I don't know why she would lie about that. So the pizza was good, but I had ordered a cup of soup and it was still cold... like it was for sure frozen before coming to our table. I asked for it to be warmed up, so she put it back in the microwave (yum....) and brought it out luke warm. Awesome. Now, I like streets.... this location is just not that great."}
{"text":"We grabbed dinner at the Streets of New York this evening, what a great meal.  I had the cheese ravioli with pesto sauce and my husband had the spaghetti and meatballs.  Fabulous!  We started with artichoke and spinach dip with flatbread appetizer and the bread sticks and marinera sauce, num.   Our server was so sweet and helpful--what a nice way to end a good day."}
{"text":"This place is the best. Great service, good food and the beer selection is on point! I would highly recommend this location for any type of occasion. Love me some Orange Blossom! :-)"}
{"text":"Pizza was good! Our server was Sedona, she was super kind, very funny, and extremely helpful!! We ordered the Classic Margherita pizza! To die for"}
{"text":"\"Great service, they even served free amazing garlic rolls while we waited to keep the kids happy. Pizza was very yummy too!\""}
{"text":"Great food consistent from location to location.  Service service depends on the day and time you go and how busy the restaurant"}
{"text":"The service at this place sucks, got our drinks and asked for some bread it was cold 1/2 hour later our waitress told us that she was sorry but our pizza was just put In the oven there was only us and two other tables in the whole place said they were busy with carry out orders so I complained and she said she would talk to the manager and he decided to give us a whopping 10% discount big deal, anyway after another 1/2 hour or so we got our pizza which wasn't to bad but don't think I'll be going back to this streets of new York."}
{"text":"Doing the delivery thing lately - don't know if they have had a change in food purveyors or just wanted to cut their food cost, but it just doesn't taste like it used to.  It's too bad because we have a  number of choices for Pizza (not including \"Ray's\" - as nasty as it gets) - and it's easy enough to try someone else."}
{"text":"Some friends and I got delivery from here on Saturday night and were pleasantly surprised. It wasn't the best pizza in the world but it did the job. The staff were nice and friendly from the person who answered the phone, to the delivery guy who brought our pizza exactly at our quoted time. We got a medium pepperoni jalapeño pizza which was yummy and spicy. We also got their honey hot wings which were ok, nothing to write home about. And their Caesar salad which was just lettuce, a tomato, some parm, and dressing. It was better than the chains in our area and was impressed by the service we received!"}
{"text":"The food is always good, but always horribly slow for takeout and delivery. Usually about twice what is quoted, leaving you to sit and wait. After giving multiple chances we have decided not to do business here any longer."}
{"text":"Purchased a 14 inch combo from their online menu.  The menu prices online were incorrect so I ended up paying more than I planned. They saw the out dated menu, took a picture for so they could fix it but didn't apologize or even co wider to discount the pizza.....won't be going there again.  No customer awareness or concern.  One star was too high a rating."}
{"text":"Pretty decent grub, if you like a 3000 calorie carb-o-load for dinner.  Huge portions, lots of bread, the whole deal.  We float in here on a Friday occasionally when we can't think of another dinner option.  The place seems nearly deserted every time, which beats standing in line someplace, and the food is adequate to keep us coming back occasionally.  2.5 stars rounded up to 3."}
{"text":"RUDE! RUDE! RUDE!  I had a poor experience there and called the owner of my experience.  I kindly explained my situation at his restaurant.  I never got an apology, I'm sorry, nothing!!!  I work for a five diamond restaurant and have never been treated so poorly, ever!  Please do not support places that treat their customers like this."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. It was really good food and pretty reasonably priced.  We are also a member of SouthWest Airlines dining rewards so that is why we came here. The garlic knots that was put on the table was great. The customer service was good. The only down side was the waiter smelled a little musty. A shower would have done him well but the service he gave was great. He will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Food was good staff friendly. Price is reasonable.  Good place for a good meal only issue wait staff was a Tad slow wanted check an when I got had to wait awhile for them to take it."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. I was torn between a 1 and a 0 on this review. We ordered two pizzas, a salad, and soda at 6:00. I was told it would arrive in within 45 minutes to an hour. I called after an hour and fifteen minutes. The woman on the phone told me that \" he is on his way - only five or ten more minutes\". I asked if the pizza would be warm and she said it would be, or I could call back. 
When they arrived 15 minutes later, both pizzas were soggy and inedible. When I opened the salad the lettuce was wilted, and the tomatoes looked as though they had been cut hours ago. 
We often order from the Streets at 44th and Camelback, and have never had a bad experience. We have had mediocre luck with the rest. on Thomas (the only one that delivers to our current location). 
I called to complain, and the woman on the phone said she would call her manager. I told her I wasnt interested in another pizza because I did not want to wait another hour. She said - well I will give the manager your message. This was a $58. order - which we threw in the trash because it was inedible.
I am looking for recommendations of decent pizza delivery in South Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Good pizza, great wings, and a friendly staff. Been here 4 or 5 times and haven't been disappointed yet"}
{"text":"On a whim, we were craving pizza and wanted to try someplace new.  We were NOT disappointed. It is a quaint little spot and their staff is very friendly and helpful with suggesstions since we had never been there.  We had pizza and salad. Not sure it is like New York pizza but still very good...better than most places that claim the name or style.  I will definitely return and try other items on the menu.  Definitely reccommend this place!!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here in Arizona with this pizza place and they were amazing staff was great our food was delivered in a timely manner and pizza was so good nothing was left over thanks for the great service corona clan"}
{"text":"Service, excellent. Food just edible. Place feels a little dirty, sticky tables and seats. Won't come back. Been to far better Streets of New York restaurants."}
{"text":"The app worked awesome to order food.  Food was on time for pick up.  The place looked Nice enough to come in and eat.  Got pizza and wings.  I like baked wings and these were good. nice size wing, good medium flavor, not over cooked or dry at all. I'd get those again.  .... but the pizza was not that good.  It was missing cheese in some spots.  All my family members indicated the pizza was not good.  For a $20+ pizza cheese it was not good at all. 5 Star wings. 2 Star pizza."}
{"text":"I'm wanted to give it a 3.5 but yelp is dumb and doesn't let you. There are a couple of subs I like from this place and the pizza is decent but not a great value at all. I have gone to streets of NY for at least 15 years now and they just seem to be generally slipping and losing touch. For the price of a pizza here I can get better quality pizza at other restaurants around the area. They are gonna be out of business in 5 years if they don't pull it together and revamp their business model and food. I'm hoping they can pull it together....... I do look forward to trying the squaish ravioli, Not sure what squaish is but looking forward to trying it!"}
{"text":"Saturday night didn't feel like going out but was looking for an Italian dinner. Pasta for my wife and a pizza for me. 

Ordered on line and the experience was great. Easy to navigate and a delivery time is given. In our case 7:00. So we opened a bottle of wine in anticipation of the arriving dinner. 

At about 7:10 the doorbell rang and our meal had arrived. This is where our evening turned. My wife had ordered angel hair pasta with marinara and meatballs. What she got was a dish of dry pasta (little sauce) and not the angel hair. My pizza was the worst. I've never in my life thrown a pizza away as there's always some redeeming quality somewhere. Not in this case. Ordered the thin and crispy 18\" pie to freeze the left overs. What I got was a cold dried out pie with what seemed to be a \"ready made\" crust. Had little dimples underneath in the crust from the production process. Tasted worse than any frozen pizza I'd ever had from a supermarket. 

After spending 40 with tip for this meal, we were extremely disappointed. My advise. Don't order the thin & crispy unless you're a connoisseur of frozen pizzas."}
{"text":"Food: Taste Great
Price: Good
Service: Good

Although there's a few not so great review about this place, I had a good impression. My first time there, the lady waiter was kind to us. Although I didn't see the owner or the man that some others were commented on their reviews, I enjoyed the food. I did dine-in the first time and I really liked how the food came out super hot. The 2nd time, I ordered to go and the food I got were hot when she handed me my order. The price of the food is also decent. The food ranges around $10-$20ish and it's worth the amount ur getting. I order a chicken garlic calzone and the baked ziti to go on my 2nd time there. The baked ziti looked small but still fulfilling. The calzone however, was ginormous! Bigger than my head or my two hands side by side. The next day, I had left overs of the calzone and heated up in the oven again and it still tasted great. I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"My family and I enjoyed the appetizing Italian fare delivered from here by Uber Eats. We had the chicken parmesan, spinach and artichoke dip, lasagna, spaghetti, and salad. The spinach and artichoke dip was not as expected but it was delicious! Our kiddos loved the spaghetti and chicken fingers and our other pasta dishes were delightful. Only suggestion our salad arrived without dressing. I mean, who eats garden salad without dressing?? Luckily we had our own. Overall we were highly pleased with our meal. If you are craving delicious Italian eats, this place is great!"}
{"text":"The 10\" Margherta pizza smelled fresh and yummy and the 4pc Chicken mix was also very tasty, but the chicken was a pinch salty but still juicy. The garlic bread and wedges that came with the chicken mix was pretty good. Some of the garlic bread was bit tough but still has a good flavor. The wedges are nicely flavored and crispy. Was a bit pricey but sort of worth it. Overall I give it a 8 1/2 out of 10."}
{"text":"You know, I really loved this restaurant and it is a shame that they have lost my and my family's business for good. First off, their management needs a lesson in customer service! 

One fine Saturday evening, my parents and I were babysitting my nieces and we decided to order pizzas from Streets of New York for the whole family. One of the pizzas we asked them to hold the cheese as I'm vegan and I do not eat cheese. Well, we drive all the way there to pick up the food, drive all the way home and there's cheese on my pizza. This prompted me to call and speak to the manager who argued with me saying I said I wanted cheese on the pizza essentially calling me a liar and not offering any solution to the problem. Why would I say I wanted cheese on the pizza when I don't eat it? Doesn't make sense, right?! After spending $77 that night I was forced to order a new pizza and spend even more money and time going to pick it up. 

It really stinks because I was starting to eat here about once a week. Because of the poor service I received I am no longer visiting this location."}
{"text":"A mix up on store phone numbers led to a 108 minute debacle of the wrong pizza delivered.  The one we got looked the driver had been drifting on the way here :-( 
Uncharacteristic for this place. Manager made us a new pizza so we are finally going to eat what we ordered almost 2 hrs ago."}
{"text":"I've driven by the Streets of New York for the last 5 years just wishing I could eat there. Even from down the road you can smell the aroma of garlic and freshly baked pizza and I lamented the fact that there was nothing on the menu that was within my diet. Fast forward 5 years and they now have a gluten free pizza menu as well as several appetizers available for those with Celiac of gluten sensitivity.

For starters, they offer a gluten free version of bruschetta as well as a spinach and artichoke dip that will nearly have you licking the plate. The spin-dip was by far my favorite, boasting just enough vegetables to make you think you're eating health food, but with a hearty helping of cheese to remind you that you're actually indulging. We also ordered up a batch of their gluten free honey BBQ wings and my 3 year old couldn't get enough of those, shrieking excitedly every time she licked the sweet sauce. Be sure to specify when you order wings that you need them prepared gluten free; they have a separate preparation process for gluten free wings to help reduce any possibility of cross contamination.

Let's talk pizza: I've been eating a lot of it the last few years since more and more restaurants are now serving it. My main concern with many pizza places that sell gluten free is that they serve the crust, but don't know squat about proper preparation techniques. Jimmy, the General Manager at the Camelback and 3rd St. location, gave me a tour of the kitchen on my recent visit. He showed me their gluten free preparation area, the separate tray and utensil storage area, and their cooler to show me that they follow recommended techniques to reduce the risk of cross contamination. Additionally, they use separate ingredients, racks, plates, gloves, and utensils to do their best to serve the Celiac and gluten free community. All locations have been trained on safe handling methods by Lynn Rae Ries of Gluten Free Creations, who also supplies their gluten free products.

We ordered 2 pizzas, both were 10 inch \"personal\" pizzas, but you could easily split one with a friend if you started with an appetizer. All ingredients tasted very fresh and the crust had a great texture, which is one of the hardest things to get right in the gluten free world. I personally like a combo of black olives, salami, and spinach, which won't break the bank at around $15. My husband opted for a garlic chicken, peppers, and mushroom pizza, which was tasty as well. They will even deliver and offer catering of their gluten free items for the big game or an office party.

The atmosphere reminds me a lot of a pizza place in Boston my mom used to take me - the kind of place that you would go celebrate winning a soccer match with your team, go on a casual first date, or take the family out for Sunday lunch. After dark, the lights go down and the candles come out while their patio lights up with fairy lights.

The only thing I could suggest for Streets of New York is to add some gluten free offerings to the dessert menu (I'm a sucker for chocolate) and to add a gluten free beer or cider option to the drink menu. Overall, it was a great dining experience and I'm sure that my family will be back soon!

{"text":"One of my favorite locations. Great service, never over crowded, the yummiest bread baskets, kids love their menu items and the salads are always fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"I gotta say, we really like this place. We've ordered delivery from them twice. Their marinara sauce is damn good. Hubby likes the eggplant rolotini, and I've had their chicken parm and my daughter had spaghetti with sausage. The first time we tried their margherita on thin and crispy crust and didn't care for it at all. Too many tomatoes and the crust just seemed almost pre-made or packaged. Second try we had the combo pizza on regular crust and it was really, really good. Definitely our new go-to pizza/pasta joint. Oh and the girl over the phone already remembered me on my second call and was super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving it 2 stars instead of 1 is because the pizza is good.  I walked in and everyone that works their was sitting down eating pizza and watching TV.  I had called ahead and ordered but my pizza wasn't ready when I got there. I waited and 10 minutes later he came by and told me that the order hadn't even gotten back to the kitchen.  I had to wait another 20 minutes because of their mistake. I normally wouldn't care but he didn't even offer me a class of water while I was waiting. When I was leaving he even forgot to offer me any cheese or pepper to go with the pizza.  Good pizza but lazy and not customer centric service."}
{"text":"Prices are good, food is good value (not best pizza ever but definitely good enough), and laid back atmosphere that I really like.  Perfect place to take kids or just go and have pizza and beer with friends.  Laid back, not formal, good value.  Lastly, I agree with other reviews that it is not true \"New York\" pizza if that is what you are expecting by the name, but still good."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, delicious, moist, warm, cheesy, made to order... friendly staff, fast service, good prices! We went yesterday for the first time, loved it so much, and returned again today! Streets of New York is surely one to keep on our list of favorites here on out!"}
{"text":"I was driving around the North Phoenix area around 8 and started feeling hungry. I passed the Streets of New York, and made a quick turn to dive into their parking lot and decided to give it a shot. The place is medium sized and pretty casual, with TVs playing sports situated around the room. This is a good place to go for a pizza party with your baseball team. I ended up getting a large Pepperoni with black olives, and a chopped antipasto salad. It turned out the be a great choice. The pizza was great. New York style, etc. The best aspect was probably the salad. Really great. The waitress was attentive, but not of the highest quality. It was a fun atmosphere and I'd definitely go back soon. SONY is now my favorite pizza joint in the valley. (I have only tried Papa John's, Pizza Hut, and Peter Piper's so far)."}
{"text":"Was seriously the cleanest restaurant I ever went to! My server Oscar was the AMAZING he filled our drinks before we were even out, every time. He gave me the perfect recommendation based on what I was in the mood for!!! Never have I ever had better service. Will recommend to all my family and friends! Oh and the table cleanest ever. Thanks Oscar!!!"}
{"text":"Well I can understand why there is no one in here on a busy Saturday for lunch. It's usually a good indication of the quality of a restaurant when there are unbused tables and the staff are aimlessly walking around. Sat at the bar and bartender was on her cell so we had to wait until she finished before she took our order. Simple stuff like a coaster for our drinks or silverware or our meals was not automatic. Food was good pizzeria food."}
{"text":"Totally messed up my order did not care it was crazy how much they did not care was kind of like hey you drove here so might as well take what we got"}
{"text":"My girl and I were always a little apprehensive about this place, only because it reminded us of bad experiences at other local pizza spots,  however on a whim we decided to check streets of New York out. 

Boy we were pleasantly surprised, from the delicious smells at the entrance,  to the super friendly staff,  this was a definite excellent choice. 

I recommend their XL new york pizza slice... It's got everything you could want and the crust is so crispy through eat bite. 
We also tried their boneless wings, which were fresh as I'll get out! 

Overall, don't be put off by the dark windows and dim lights, this place is just the pizza Haven you can really    dig. 

A huge thank you to Lacey our waitress, it's refreshing to see someone so cool and professional that goes the extra step to make sure we were totes satisfied."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place, either eating in, or having it delivered, it is always a pleasant experience. Service is great, food is delicious, great ambiance. Never had any complaints,"}
{"text":"The best pepperoni pizza and wings I've had since moving to Arizona. The food taste delicious! I felt like I was right in New York. 

I've had the opportunity of picking up my order and the delivery service. The hospitality from Streets of New York is great! My family and I are planning to dine in and try some of the other things on the menu. I must mention the delivery service from Tony is A1! Great guy!"}
{"text":"Best damn pizza I've had out here in Arizona. Everyone else nearby does extra thick crust but these guys know they're pizza. The seasonings on top are what really do it for me. Only thing I didnt like were the French fries. Insanly greesy but nevertheless, I give the pizza 5/5."}
{"text":"New owners much more friendly than previous, pizza is always good and wait staff always friends reviews about wait staff being frustrated at closing....wouldn't you be"}
{"text":"My wife and I first went here a few days ago, the service was great and the food was even better. Robin was our waitress and she couldn't have been better. While we were there she told us about their rewards program. We signed up and got a free drink. If I would have written my review then I would have given this place 5 stars!

Today, my wife and I returned and brought with us a couple friends. Our server was Carol, she was very sweet. We had gotten an offer, my wife, myself, and her friend. The offer was for two slices of cheese pizza and a drink for $5. On the deal it says that it is limited PER CUSTOMER. So we assumed that each of us could get it. When we went to order Carol said she only do the deal for one person at the table. We showed her that it said per customer. She then went to the back to speak to someone and came back saying that she was told no, but would do it for us this time. By the end of it all, we didn't get the deal on our check. It also took an hour from the time we sat down to get our food. It took another thirty minutes (not at all exaggerating) for us to pay. 

Another party sat next to us, and at one point were serving themselves because the food was not being delivered. It was not a good experience at all. 

I love the food, so I may give it another try, but they need to work with their staff more on serving their guest in a timely manner and also work on their rewards program and either honor what the coupon says, or change it."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are really good. I am however, spoiled from all of the awesome pizza I have had in Chicago. Not many places out here can even come close. The pizza in my opinion is ok though"}
{"text":"My family has relied on this location for take-out on multiple family gatherings and every time they've come through. I've taken out and dined in and never had any issue. We'll continue to come back. I haven't had anything on the menu I didn't like. The restaurant is clean, the hostess is genuinely friendly and the manager I've encountered is on the ball."}
{"text":"Food is ok. Slow service. The waitresses were not rude but they were definitely not nice or helpful either."}
{"text":"I discovered this place through a delivery app.  Needless to say I've become a frequent customer since.  I still need to try the pizza (I know, that's supposed to be what they're about), but I'm so in love with their hot sandwiches(all of them!!!) that I can't talk myself out of ordering one when I get the craving.  I haven't had anything that hasn't been great. AND they deliver!!!  Total win-win for me."}
{"text":"Terrible service, always out of .75 cent drafts.. food is ok but have to do takeout to avoid the terrible staff. Go down the street to NYPD, 10x better Pizza and AMAZING service."}
{"text":"Poor service and rude wait staff. I have been a few times and didn't see the difference. I saw one couple come in about five minutes before closing and treated rudely like it was a chore for the workers to help them. The couple walked out. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken tuscano for $13 and asked for fettuccini noodles and given angel hair pasta instead. Ordered side order of garlic bread and they charged me $5.50 for 1 piece of bread cut in half. This place has decent food but the service isn't up to par and they charge way too much for the quality of food they give."}
{"text":"Absolute worst wings I've ever had, I'm 43, may be the first time I've ever asked for my money back. Soggy, and no sauce."}
{"text":"This is a review only based on quality of food since I chose my meal to be delivered. 

Delivery guy was very friendly and quick. I ordered the Pizza Primavera with \"Roma tomatoes\" and a bunch of other veggies. \"Thin N crispy crust\".

I swear I'm usually an indiscriminate eater but this pizza was barely edible. The crust is just mushy, nothing I was expecting. The cheese made it worse blending all the ingredients together. It had big pieces of zucchini you can taste by themselves. Simply insipid. 

I'm not from this country but I've been to New York many times. This pizza had nothing to do with the NY style pizza. Lemonade was way too sweet as well. 

I'm sorry but I'm not inclined to try other foods from this business. Too bad cause the delivery time was excellent..."}
{"text":"I swear this has to be their smallest location.  Not that the size of the place ever stopped us from eating there.  But it was close to the bar where we used to Karaoke and it made it a one stop parking for the whole night to grab dinner here, then go sing and drink next door.  Still not a bad proposition.  

But really - go for the food.  And yea, they deliver too.  If all you want is thinner pizza it might not make much of a difference to you.  But if you're looking for a pasta dinner or their thick deep dish - then you really want to eat it here.  It almost has a mom & pop feeling to the location. Service won't be super, but it gets the job done.  They know the smell of the place alone will win you over.  You're only going to get much personality out of their delivery folks.  

Darn good basic Italian and Pizza fare, with a few specialties thrown in, at a pretty good price.  Feels quite a bit like an old school neighborhood pizza parlor, which certainly adds to it's charm."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner tonight.  They have the best antipasto salad and Pizza in the valley!  Service by Jovan was Spot On!"}
{"text":"Good Broasted Chicken

I went there because I wanted the broasted chicken. After I had been there a few minutes, the server finally brought me a menu, but it didn't have the broasted chicken in it. It took quite a while for me to get her attention to let her know that I needed that part of the menu. The chicken, when it came, was excellent. I also had a slice of pizza that wasn't bad. I would have thought that the manager (I assume) would have stepped in to speed up the service. All in all, I got what I went for even if the service was a little off."}
{"text":"I used home delivery and my pizza arrived in less time than they indicated, which was great. It was hot, correctly prepared, and tasty."}
{"text":"I ordered from here today and everything showed up cold, bread was stale and my sandwich had tomatoes on it when I requested no tomatoes. People make mistakes, I totally understand but when I called to ask for JUST the sandwich to be replaced, the girl on the phone was rude. She told me I hadn't requested no tomatoes! Its not like I cant go back and look up my order! After putting me on hold, she said \"I'll have my manager re do it\" and hung up. Listen, I don't need a turkey sandwich that bad."}
{"text":"Hi my family and I have been coming to this pizza place  for a year now  we love our server Kimmy she treats us like family she also knows what all my kids like we love her and we only go there when she's there  and we will continue go as long as she's there"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite restaurant. They have amazing New York style pizza and delicious pastas, my favorite is the sandwiches though because they are large and extremely appetizing and served with crispy fries. On top of the great food they have wonderful customer service and they remember me everytime I go in. I'm not from Las Vegas but I make it a point to go here whenever I'm in town."}
{"text":"Our waiter tonight was Brandon. He had better customer service than a 5  restaurant!! Honey hot wings were on point and our pizza was great! I will defiantly be back!"}
{"text":"So ..according to The Sewers of New York, this was 75.00 dollars worth of food?!?! The food was edible and the service was sub par at best, and to top it off when we advised them of our displeasure, they didn't offer to make it right. Thank goodness we still have several days of our family reunion left!"}
{"text":"I love the New York combo pizza thin crust and the Broasters Chicken its a great local atmosphere that brings me back again and again.  The service is great they keep the refills coming and Trivia night on Tuesdays has a big crowd lots of fun."}
{"text":"I would like to give this zero stars, took almost 2 hours to get here and when it arrived the chicken had barbeque sauce poured on top of it. Also I am from New York and it is a disgrace to have the word New York  in  this businesses name . Pizza is horrible. Will never order again also over priced for shit food..."}
{"text":"I'd love to leave a review about the entire chain, because they're all great, but this is my favorite location. 

I no longer live in Phoenix, but believe it or not, I make it a point to go to Streets even before seeing my family each time I get back! Love, love, love their chewy crust, excellent sauce, and high-quality ingredients! I know they're called Streets of New York, but this pizza is way better than any of that salty cardboard pizza I've had in New York! It's somewhere between a thin and thick crust. Just perfect, in my opinion. Great food all around (but I'm talkin' pizza here!), great place for family, or just to hang out with friends and get a bite. 

I know there are a bunch of trendy, wait-for-an-hour pizza joints in Phoenix, but for me, SONY is the place to go when I'm in Phoenix. Each friend or family member I've taken there falls in love with the pizza. I've been to just about every location, but for some reason, this one feels like home to me. Maybe it's the outside eating area, or the friendly wait staff, or Jimmy, the nice guy who runs the place. I wish they had one where I live now!!!"}
{"text":"Bad service. Out of wings... Really? Cold pizza & flat soda. Dirty bathrooms with bugs all over the floors. I sent my food back and didn't eat a thing. Very disappointed and unhappy."}
{"text":"Every time we eat at this restaurant, no matter how busy or not busy, it is great food.  Their pizza & wing special is awesome!!  One of our favourite places to eat."}
{"text":"Good food, good atmosphere and their pizza & wing special is fantastic.   Great for a night out that isn't that pricy...love this place.  As snowbirds, we like to find places that serve good food with reasonable prices.   Fairly clean & good atmosphere & staff is friendly & are very helpful."}
{"text":"Tried this location 3 times. 1st I got a calzone I thought it was good at first but realized that it was not cheese and it was dough not cooked.... 2nd time I ordered a pizza not bad at all but they put wayyyy to much corn meal on the crust it was weird I brushed it off... 3rd time I ordered 2 slices I did not tip on my card it was a take out order and immediately the girls attitude changed snapped at me and said 10 minutes. I was the only person in the restaurant I figured 10 minutes they might have to cook a new pie.... not the case I got 2 slices that had enough cheese for 2 pizzas with no sauce on them at all I don't understand how a pizza restaurant can get pizza wrong on so many levels oh and if the waitress was pleasant maybe she would have gotten a tip on a take out order."}
{"text":"Best gluten-free pizza in town! You can also get the gluten version, if you prefer. Good, affordable lunch menu. Their Best of Everything sub really is the best - get extra of their delicious vinaigrette on the side. Stick to pizza and subs here instead of pasta."}
{"text":"I was looking for a good wing place, and decided to try there wing's, was I glad I did.
My friend and I got 2, 12 piece wing's with medium sauce, and WERE THEY GOOD.
They were large and plump, the kind where it takes 3-4 bites to finish,very tasty, medium sauce was awesome, although they have 7-8 kinds to choose from. The only thing we had were the wings, but if everything else is as good as there wing's, I found a winner, I don't really care for New York style pizza, to thick, but they have thin crust as well. 
So if you want the best wing's in the valley try them. You'll be glad you did. Plus they deliver......."}
{"text":"The food is great. The service is.. bad.. very bad.

Upon arrival we were told just go find a seat anywhere there was only 1 booth open and 2 with tons of dishes on them. We went to the open booth because we have a baby and it's easier to block her into the inside of a booth. We go to the booth and it was super dirty the server came by and cleaned it for us after a few minutes. She came back and took our drink orders at which point we also ordered the street fry appetizer. They were delicious but they took 15 minutes to get out which in my opinion is a long time for fries. While we were waiting for the appetizer we ordered our main course. We were 1 of 2 tables left at this point. After finishing the appetizer it was another 20 minutes for the main course in which time our server never returned to our table to refill our glasses which were all empty at this point or to even ask how we were doing. FINALLY our food shows up on their station with the heat lamps where it sat , while our server chatted with the bartender, for another 10 minutes. She finally decided to bring us our food and says oh I'll be back to refill your drinks which didn't happen for ANOTHER 10 minutes. She finally returned and 1 of my party of 4 sent their wings back. They were burnt to a crisp and cold simultaneously..weird.. she offered to bring him a slice of pizza, which she did, after yet another 15 minutes. At this point nobody was hungry anymore everyone's food was cold so we sat, another 15 minutes. Before finally I got up and asked the server who again was chatting with the bar tender for our boxes and our bill. She brings our bill fairly quickly at that point.. the only thing she did quickly. Honestly.. if it wasn't for the amazing pizza here it would be a 1 star review, but, the food really is very good. Just order it to go.. you don't want to leave with a bad taste in your mouth from the untrained service who couldn't care less about you or your experience."}
{"text":"This was the coldest, most disgusting, most expensive pizza I have ever had!!! It is absolutely NOT anything like New York Style pizza. You would be further ahead to order from some lame chain like Little Ceasars or Dominos, at least you will get what you paid for!! The crust was like stale cardboard, the toppings were sparse, at best. Not only was the the delivery time outrageous, the food arrived cold! Most of the \"food\" went into the trash, where it belonged. If I could give zero stars, I would."}
{"text":"Fairly low key place that isn't too busy on weeknights.  They have good value with pizza specials & draft beer specials, though the draft beer selection isn't very large.  Plenty of parking and friendly service.  Pizza is just alright though."}
{"text":"I like going to streets of new york as it really has that old school pizza parlor feel - like when I was a kid and pizza was something you went out for, not something you had delivered. They also bring you bread sticks and dipping sauce as soon as you sit down, that was a nice touch! The pizza itself, while not the best I've had, was pretty good. Flavorful sauce and plenty of cheese, just like I like it. The crust is buttery and soft, which I also like sometimes. They also offer a few other things besides pizza which seemed interesting. Service was quick and attentive - my soft drink was constantly filled. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"My family is VERY familiar with this restaurant. We used to order delivery from here quite often since they first opened. When the food is done right, it is AMAZING. BUT, that only happens about 25% of the time. I am embarrassed to call them anymore as the notes in our account are probably the size of an encyclopedia. We have probably been credited so much money that it costs them more to answer our phone calls than what a week of profitable business brings in. Every person we have had interaction with has been very pleasant and understanding, and unfortunately even the store manager remembers us and we have only spoken twice. I am sad to say that the past history (spaghetti calzone orders, delivery times, order discrepancies, poor food) and with tonight's cold congealed toasted subs have brought us to the point of just being to tired to try again. I have no idea what has happened over the last six months, but our patience is gone and IMO the franchise owner needs to step in and do something. We cannot be the only persons that are being credited 75% of the time. I mean that our free credits are even being credited...I will end on a good note though, if you get a spaghetti calzone that is complete, it will alter your taste buds! Sorry to cut ties, but there are just too many other places that make the grade."}
{"text":"Me and my husband placed an order on GrubHub and received an email saying the food would be delivered in an hour. After that hour had passed our food still hadn't been delivered. I called the store and they informed me the driver was out and would be there shortly. 2 hours later we finally receive our delivery. We barely ate any of it since it was lukewarm and now soggy from being kept in their containers for such an extended amount of time and not to mention the order was incorrect. That was our first and last time ever going to Streets of NY. 

I'm giving a 3 star rating just based purely off the customer service. The manager is crediting our account for future orders and apologized profusely for the delay. I wish the food would of been worth the wait."}
{"text":"The placed looked kinda neat from the outside so I stopped in for a few slices.. I really likes the vibe inside it was really comfortable. The staff were really nice and really fast and accommodating.. they even gave me a drink to go! The pizza was really good.. especially the cheese.. you can tell they use high quality mozzarella and the stretchyness was on point! I'd recommend stopping in for a quick lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"We stopped in last night after driving around trying to find a place. Pizza was like microwaveable. We ordered appetizers first. We then ordered our meals which all came out separate. I ordered garlic bread with my pasta it came out 20 min before my dinner. Pasta was cold cheese wasn't even melted on top. Wings were good. Pizza was hard and yuck! Staff was ok. Never again!"}
{"text":"Pizza was burnt and greasy. Passion bread was okay. Ordered take out hoping for a delicious NY style pizza and was severely disappointed. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I shouldn't have judged this place so soon. They are local to my apartment, they do deliver for $2.90, but I've been back 3 times since my first review and I'm getting bummed out here.

A few weeks back my boyfriend and I wanted to get a little buzzed at home, so we decided on streets of new york to deliver us some grub. We went with pasta. My boyfriend got the spaghetti with meat balls, and I got the meat ravioli. Ah I really hate to say this, but I would have had a better time eating a can of Chef Boyardee. I don't know what is up with their \"beef/sausage\" but it always has a funny taste to it. Kind of like when you re-heat a hamburger in the microwave. That taste. I was less than impressed. The salad it came with was decent, and I'd go back just for the bread, but even with a buzz I wasn't enjoying my pasta. The boyfriend agreed it lacked flavor and was 'off'. 

Then yesterday we decided to have another one of these nights, and do the Pizza instead since our pizza was good the first round. I got chicken and pepperoni on mine, and he got sausage. They charge extra for chicken. Um.. I don't really understand why. The chicken is breaded chicken strips that they just cut up and threw on the pizza. I wasn't impressed AT all. The sausage on my boyfriends pizza tasted weird and sweet like.... I don't know what's up with this place!

So I say if you're going to go with one of their pizzas, definitely get a coupon and stick to the basics. I suggest the bacon, or pepperoni."}
{"text":"This place has the best Gluten Free Pizza Crust I have tasted in Vegas! My friends couldnt even tell the difference and the price was pretty decent for a gluten free hawaiian pizza! I will be returning very soon!"}
{"text":"I find their pizza very good. It's tough to find a good NY style thin crust pizza in Chandler and theirs is one of the best in town (not the best ever, just in Chandler). I would give them more stars but unfortunately it's pretty pricey. I usually order a 3 topping large pizza, pick it up on my way home, and pay around $26... too much for a single pizza... :("}
{"text":"I was just looking at my older reviews, and found that this one needs an update.  We took a lengthy break from Streets after my last review, but we have been back in the past year.  The restaurant has been MUCH cleaner in recent visits, the service has been prompt and the food very tasty.  My only suggestion now is that the newer lighting (bulbs over the tables) are intensely bright, to point of being blinding.  We have just unscrewed the bulb when we visit to keep my hubby from getting a migraine.  Aside from that little tid-bit, great job of turning things around.  We need good quality food service in town and I am happy to see the wonderful improvements made here.  =)"}
{"text":"Great quality food and wonderful staff members! Thanks guys, Keep doin what your doin! :)"}
{"text":"Always get the pastrami sandwich, my indulgence. Other good option is the Best of Everything sandwich. All come with great fries and a big pickle, bread and dip if requested."}
{"text":"Do not order delivery.  Took 1 1/2 hours, food was burnt and order was incorrect.  We have had this happen before and we thought we would give them another chance.  Never again"}
{"text":"Mediocre pizza in a passable pizza joint. It's probably my favorite in north Phoenix, although that absolutely isn't saying much. Pretty slim competition. Little too greasy for my tastes and often lacks a little in the crust department. Still, it's a solid step up from delivery or frozen, and they usually have exactly the right amount of cheese for my liking. So it certainly isn't bad. You could do worse."}
{"text":"I just ordered Pizza, pasta, and beer cheese. It arrived in less than half the time quoted, super fresh and yummy. 
We were missing. Our bread for our beer cheese, but I called back and Jeff was nothing but helpful and courteous, offering to have the driver come right back, and asking if there was anything else he could do. 
We just moved to the area, and I can guarantee that next time we want pizza and wings or pasta, we will order from them. Service was exceptional. Thanks Jeff!"}
{"text":"We use to love Streets of NewYork pizza. But the last 3 times we ate there their food sucks. Not only is the food terrible it is way overpriced. The cheapest Frozen pizza from the grocery store is much better.
And to top it off the waitress was very rude. Will never eat at a Streets of New York again."}
{"text":"I decided to hold off on the review until we actually dined in so we can give a full review experience. 

So SoNY is our default place for our take out. We have picked up pies here 4x and have been satisfied every time!! 
Crispy crust, gooey cheese and fresh veggies! Every pie that we have gotten for take out has been excellent. Yes, it is a bit more expensive vs the giant pizza chains there is no comparison when it comes to the quality. 

The same compliments aforementioned above cannot be said about the lunch spcials. We came in here for lunch and ordered the 2 slice deal. Like most places that offer by the slice, a blank pie is baked and the topping are added then rebaked. I understand this and it is fine however on our visit the slices that I got looked and tasted like they were we baked several times, the cheese was all brown and dry and the pepperoni were also dried out and crunchy; a total disappointment. 

Ordering a whole pie: 5 star
Lunch specials: 2 star
Service: 4 star

Final rating 3.5 star"}
{"text":"If for some reason you end up at the Northern Ave location...drive a block and a half further east and go to Stumpy's instead. The pizza at SNY was OK. Not great but not worth seeking out. 
I was in Phx on business and was staying a few blocks away so I decided to try both of these local joints. This place tastes like pizza hut on a good day. Crust is decent. Toppings are decent. Cheese is OK. 
Like I said. This isn't a bad slice but it isn't a good slice of pizza either. Very nice staff. Nice location. The patio has cool atmosphere. TVs have sports showing. Just missed the mark in my opinion. 
Nothing NY about this pie."}
{"text":"I drove by this place so many times in the past couple months and a friend finally urged me to check it out.   

I went there tonight with a friend.   

The waiter \"Stirling\"  was very nice and very friendly.   The food came out quick.. We both ordered the Chicken Parm with Angel hair.   The sauce was ok a little chunkier than I like it...  other than that it was great the drink cups were big and the Waiter kept them full.   The portion was really big which is good because I like to eat.   

I really enjoyed the food the atmosphere and the how friendly the staff was.   I will defiantly be back real soon! check it out!"}
{"text":"We came in with a group of around 20 and got a whole section to ourself(thanks to reservation). The waiter was kind and kept his cool. I know if I was a waitress I'd be freaking out with all the people. I ordered the ravioli and had to wait a little, because of all the people. The edges of it were cold, but I didn't really care, the inside and cheese were warm, that's all what mattered to me. I recommend this place. I didn't try the pizza, because I hate any pizza but my parents really enjoyed their pizza."}
{"text":"A really good pizza place. Great service and great pizza. We didn't order anything else, but the staff kept our drinks filled and attended all of our needs. I would definitely recommend to families or anyone who just wants a good pie."}
{"text":"The food was excellent the only concern I had was unfortunately I got a trainee that took my carry out order. This was a little time consuming and I understand having to train personnel at some point. Just my opinion but I think if you let your personnel learn your menu better before having them take orders over the phone could make a big difference."}
{"text":"My sister, brother-in-law and I just got back from having an early dinner at Streets of New York. We're originally from Chicago and have really missed the broasted chicken that was a staple there. The broasters at SONY are even better than the chicken we used to get back home. Our server, Sterling, made our dining experience even better. He greeted us as soon as we walked in, gave us menus and took our drink order almost immediately after we were seated. He was very pleasant and attentive. He's definitely an asset to this restaurant. We ordered potato skin appetizers that were some of the best I've had. Our chicken and broasted potatoes were piping hot. The chicken was moist and delicious and the potatoes were crispy on the outside and soft and tasty on the inside. I have a feeling we'll be spending lots of time at this restaurant."}
{"text":"We were able to order pizza dough and sauce , the kids had a blast making there personal pizza at home. Didn't even know places offered that! When I went to pick food up the place looked like it would be fun to hang out for food and customer service was great. I will definitely be back. This time for dine in."}
{"text":"My wife and I used to enjoy Streets all the time but then their prices started going up while their portions and quality consistently went down so hadn't eaten there for years.  Received a coupon for a free 14\" pizza with a donation so decided to take the family out and try it again.  We were greeted right away and told to sit anywhere we liked.  The place was virtually empty.  There were five tables that had people at them and this was at 6:00 PM.  A nice girl came right to us and said our server would be right with us and asked if she could get us some drinks.  We ordered drinks luckily because it was over ten minutes before our server came to our table.

We assumed that the girl that originally got our drinks was maybe an assistant server but then when another couple came in and sat at the table behind us, she immediately took their order and served them while our waiter was handling every other table.

We ordered the beer battered combination to start and my wife was really looking forward to the zucchini that came with it.  Unfortunately a few minutes after eating our waiter came over and said that he just learned they were out of zucchini but he could give us extra mozzarella sticks and onion rings instead.  Reluctantly we agreed.

After 20 minutes our so our pizzas came and although they had really good flavor, and looked great from the top, the crust wasn't quite done.

Their prices are still very high for what you get, and the service was sub-par.  I can see why they weren't busy."}
{"text":"Terrible pizza. As a relatively new arizona transplant, I had been looking for a great local pizza joint. These guys charge restaurant prices for horrible rubbery SAMs club quality pizza. $30 for shit pizza. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"This place has won New Times awards. I have never really been a huge fan. The pizza is average... a bit greasy actually. When I was younger, I worked at a video store nearby and we would often get lunch or dinner from here... it was definitely a creator of gut rot. I don't think we were able to eat there once without our stomachs regretting it later.

The people who work there range from being super nice and cool to downright sucking. I once had one of the girls who worked there start joking with me by making fun of me... it wasn't funny and when she noticed I wasn't appreciating the humor, she kept at it. I was pissed and had to go outside to wait for the pizza to be done. 

It's probably the closest pizza joint to where I live and I eat there almost never if that tells you anything. I think other locations are probably better. Streets does have a distinctive flavor going on and it's worth checking out sometime if you haven't. Just bring some Tums with you."}
{"text":"Rick, I ordered directly from the STNY website & clearly ordered delivery. You need to have a qualified programmer re-evaluate your online ordering system. For now, we'll continue to order online from Pizza Hut where we get exactly what we order & consistently friendly service."}
{"text":"Placed delivery order with an estimated delivery time of 45-60 min. Called in after 65 min had passed. Girl tells me they'll be arriving in \"only a couple minutes\". An hour and a half after ordering, our cold pizza and raviolis arrive. Pizza was mediocre and all dough. We've had better ravioli from the frozen food aisle. Definitely not worth the 90 minute wait. We will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Sloppy, slow, waiter wiping his nose as he brings my sandwich. Ask for a substitution to fries and for got a quick no. Bathroom outside the restaurant?"}
{"text":"Stop by for a quick bite on my lunch from work. Nice to get away from the office for a little bit. Food is always good and the garlic bread is amazing."}
{"text":"This was our fourth time here.  Wonderful atmosphere of an old school neighborhood pizza shop.  Good selection of freshly made quality food.  Hands down, the best pizza I have ever had.  Would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"We've been raving about Streets of New York for the 30 years we've lived in the Valley. Recently started going to the Streets on SIgnal Butte in Mesa, and it's great. Great pizza always. Great bread for while we wait. Great service. Clean - newly remodeled, in fact. A place to go for a meal any time of day and have a great experience."}
{"text":"A few friends and I visited this pizza spot for trivia. We arrived around 6 and they were pretty busy. Luckily we were able to get a booth in the back. We ordered bread with beer cheese and a large pizza to share for all four of us. 

The service was nice but they could not get an order correct save their lives. We asked for more bread on four separate occasions before they finally remembered it, we had to remind them to bring drink refills and finally our pizza order was incorrect. They were very apologetic and very nice, so I couldn't be too mad. They corrected our pizza, gave us the incorrect one for free and discounted our correct order as an apology. 

I appreciate their effort since it was clear they were busy and they tried to correct their errors. The food was good and I enjoyed it but I don't think I would go out of my way to return. 

Overall, we had an ok experience."}
{"text":"Taking a star off. Why? Ordered takeout again. 12 baked honey hot wings with a large half cheese half pepperoni. The food was still delish but we were basically shorted a slice. How you ask? Proof is in the pic."}
{"text":"So my last review I gave a generous 3 stars solely because the Broaster Chicken was excellent and my son's spaghetti was great. Well, I am taking it all back.

Did another online order for 2 white Broaster combos. One with pasta salad, one with slaw. And one kids spaghetti with the added 2 meatballs. 

Imagine my surprise when I opened my 9 year old's spaghetti after driving to my parents to deliver my 85 year old mother dinner to find no sauce. Just boiled pasta with 2 meatballs on top. Needless to say he did not eat any of it, nothing. No pasta, no meatball, no bread. Such a waste. Basically paid $6.25 for a very small coke.! 

The chicken was still good but clearly the potato wedges were yesterdays and refried. They were a dry dehydrated crumbly mess. Pasta in the pasta salad was barely cooked. Not even a smidge of al dente. I swear one of the pieces even snapped when I bit into it. 

First time around shame on you Streets of NY. Second time shame on me. I won't be giving you a third try."}
{"text":"Upon arriving, my friend and I sat down at an open booth and were given menus and had our drink order taken immediately.  This is the only thing that happened fast during our visit.  The ONLY reason this is getting even one star is because a zero-star review isn't possible.

We ordered a large Mediterranean pizza and specifically ordered chicken on half of it because one of us is vegetarian and the other isn't.  We also ordered a basket of fries as an appetizer, which came out hot, their only redeeming quality.

The pizza took a VERY long time to arrive and when it did, it was wrong.  Not only was it missing an ingredient that was listed on the menu but it had chicken on the whole pizza. We brought it to the server's attention right away and she claimed to have not heard the request and continued to argue until I made it clear I couldn't eat the chicken on the pizza.  She told me she'd be bringing me a new small one with the correct toppings in a hurry.  This pizza took longer than the first one and when it came, it too was wrong.  When we brought this to her attention, she began to argue with us and even called over another server from the table she was waiting on to argue with us further.  By this point we didn't want anything further to do with the continued disappointments Streets of New York was providing.  They had a THIRD person bring a box over for the leftover incorrect pizza and told us that we weren't being charged for anything and could just leave.  

We did just that and WON'T be back. Steer clear of this establishment if you want quality food and good guest service!!"}
{"text":"Food is DELICIOUS, the prices are great. The service is great. The bathroom is sparkling clean.

I am so glad I discovered this place through Groupon. Thus is definitely becoming one of my family favorite restaurant!!."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! I've dined in a few times and have ordered delivery many times. The traditional wings (& gluten free) are nothing like I've had anywhere else! The sauce is so delicious! I'm still trying to figure out what ingredients are used for the sauce. I've tried almost everything on the menu from pasta to pizza and everything tastes fresh! The spinach used in the pasta is not frozen and the mushrooms are not canned! It's hard to find that at many pizza places."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and might possibly be my last time. It's kind of a shame because the food was actually pretty good but the customer service was just atrocious. It took us almost an hour to get our food, after our waitress forgot to put our order in. Once the order came, it was incorrect. We finished eating and weren't checked on for about 20 more minutes after that. We never got refills or anything. When we finally got our checks, the checks were incorrect. So she went back to change it and didn't come back for another ten minutes. I got so fed up, as it had then been 2 hours since we arrived, went to the cash register, dropped some cash and left. Our waitress was frazzled and confused the whole time. It's not like it was busy... there were 2 other parties in the whole restaurant besides us. If you're debating on visiting, just make sure you have plenty of time to spare because who knows how long it'll take and how attentive and helpful they'll be."}
{"text":"What can I say I'm here on a Sunday.. Wow great service from everyone. Home away from home . The pizza pie was great . No complaints at all keep up the great work and thank you hands down 5 STARS ON A SUNDAY"}
{"text":"Cheap and delicious. Service can be hit or miss. But when the pizza is good, it's amazing..."}
{"text":"My family ate here last night for dinner. The service is wonderful. The food came out timely and tasted great! This place is what a fast casual pizza place should be! Everyone smiling and serving very good food. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"We live nearby and have tried to like this place. While eating in the service was marginal and the food was only ok. While ordering delivery we've been disappointed every time. We've tried the thin crust. We've tried hand tossed. Everything is only passable. I've finally given up and declared Streets not worth our effort."}
