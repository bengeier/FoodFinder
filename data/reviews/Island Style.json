{"text":"It's a catch 22. They have the best authentic Jamaican food in Cleveland, but hours are sometimes inconsistent, and menu items are inconsistent. But, they do have the best marinated jerk chicken (and gravy) that isn't a topically seasoned like other Jamaican spots. Curry goat and chicken are also great. They have a spicy shrimp that seems to only be sold on Fridays, and plantains are damn near impossible to get. Portion sizes are healthy. Pricing is moderate, but don't plan on leaving without spending at least $10."}
{"text":"We had stewed chicken, oxtails and curry goat with red beans & rice. This was our first time trying goat and it was excellent! We went back twice in 1 week. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because we waited an hour and were told there wasn't a public restroom."}
{"text":"I give this restaurant 5 stars because the food is delicious!! And the portions are great!! The lady that cooks is a sweet lady always a smile ... The only issue is the front counter lady Carla is very very very very very rude!!! She doesn't EVER seem to want to be at work!! Lol If I were to locate a place whose oxtails were as good as theirs I would go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great authentic food.  I'm pretty picky & over the years this is the only place I trust for  consistently delicious offerings. I recommend everything."}
{"text":"Very very very good food. Not the best sitting area, but the food is stellar. Check it out!"}
