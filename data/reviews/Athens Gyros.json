{"text":"The gyros are great! Got delivery, order was on time and as expected. Honestly don't know why it has such a bad rating."}
{"text":"Wow! Tastes just like the gyros I've had in Chicago! In my high school cafeteria!

Blech. Gyro meat had the taste and consistency of pulped newspaper and seemed to be comprised entirely of nothing but pure fat and ground-up unwanted animal parts. Can't say I've been in their establishment (I got delivery) but that pressed \"meat\" tasted more like it was rolled off of a steam-press factory line than as if it was cut off of a spit. Save yourself some money and buy a box of frozen, pre-cut gyro meat. It'll compare in quality and probably taste better too.

Fries were greasy, soggy, floppy, and all-around nasty, as if they had been sitting out for hours if not days. Think microwaved fast food. The guy who took my order sounded like he had just taken ten hits off of a gravity bong.

Seeing as Athens Gyros caused me to spend the rest of the day puking, I won't be ordering again anytime soon."}
{"text":"I think it's a sad state of affairs, when the driver informs me that I could have used a coupon that would have total $18.00 There is no human aspect or any personal identity or human reach concerning Athens's gyro."}
{"text":"I thought since they had 4 stars on grub Hub they would be somewhat good. I was wrong the chicken Alfredo was like soup the Alfredo wasn't creamy at all and had no flavor. The small salad was good and fresh had to add some positive in their. I wouldn't order the Alfredo again but I do believe in giving second chances"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery through grubhub. First delivery took 40 minutes, but the order was completely wrong. Called and they sent the driver out with the correct food. The food was terrible all around. The lamb and beef is a processed mush of combined lamb and beef and spices, cut into pieces. The chicken was incredibly salty."}
{"text":"Just received a delivery order of 2 gyro plates.  Couldn't ask for anything better especially since I live on Far East side of ic!  2 thumbs up."}
