{"text":"This place gets 4 stars for their great, authentic Vietnamese food and an extra Star for excellent and friendly service.
I went for lunch this past Saturday and had the crispy fried quail, which was excellent, and beef pho. Both were delicious. Their bubble teas are great too. The \"bubbles\" are just tapioca based so there's no burst of flavor, which I prefer. Do yourself a favor and try the coconut or avocado bubble tea!"}
{"text":"This is my family's weekly dosage of Pho. You cannot get anymore authentic, great quality, and better service than here. We have been going here ever since they are opened and continued to enjoy going to Saigon Bay! I would definitely recommend for everyone to try."}
{"text":"I was disappointed because I have never tried nor heard of bon hue. 

So after reading the description it sounded great.... Until It was brought out and i realized it was liver .

Wtf. Discussing.

You might want to add that little detail in your menu.
Thanks ."}
{"text":"I always enjoy coming to Saigon Bay. The food is tasty and the prices are reasonable. I like that they offer tofu dishes as well. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Walked into this place after walking OUT of the adjacent Sushi spot (seated for 15 minutes without seeing a server).

The menu wasn't super familiar, so I asked the waitress for her recommendation. Item B1 on the menu. Waitress was knowledgeable, appreciated her opinion on what to get.

It was a bowl with thin rice noodles, some kind of seared steak, fried pork, shrimp, & veggies. There was a lightly sweet, hot, savory sauce that you poured over it. $12 for a generous portion & 3 proteins!

The meal was complex and delicious, looks like they have some more plain teriyaki style dishes for the picky. Paired with a laughing Buddha beer (Buddha shaped bottle!) and you've got a solid dinner for less than 20 bucks.

Seriously considering going back for dinner tomorrow (business travel). 

No frills dining room, appears to be family run. 4 tops and 2 tops, no booths. Quiet, pleasant atmosphere around a nice lakefront.

Check it out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is most definitely a spot to come eat pho or any other asian plate. The service is great and the food as well. Its definitely worth going to enjoy a place to relax and enjoy great food to fill your stomach."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. Their service is courteous and polite. I would come back again."}
{"text":"We ordered 1. Pho (with Chicken) 2. Fried Calamari 3. Vermicelli with shrimp and all three of them were not good. Fried Calamari was smelling like crap (am trying to be nice with the words) and we did not touch it. Not sure if the oil was bad or if the batter was bad. Vermicelli was dry and with no seasoning at all. Pho.. was horrible with a lot of rice noodles but no real vegetables or anything and on top of that they had put in a lot of oil in the soup. I would never visit again! Is there a lower rating available than 1 star?"}
{"text":"Have eaten here twice in 1 week. Can't get enough of their food. We ordered something off their special one night and loved the flavors. Had com dac biet today and loved it. Highly recommend this restaurant for great Vietnamese cuisine."}
{"text":"Great Pho! Good broth. Good portion for a Reg bowl. Will be my new go to place for pho."}
{"text":"Good stuff. Got summer roll and pho soup. Delicious and fresh.  Feels authentic. Great iced coffee and limeade too."}
{"text":"If you are an asian or familiar with asian food then do not come here. Food are terrible! my wife could cook 10 times better.  Ice coffee tastes like water.   Service is horrible.
Will never come here again. Do not waste your money.  Doan 's place is alot better."}
{"text":"Best Pho in town! I tried Pho at many different Vietnamese  restaurants in Charlotte and I love it here the most. The broth is as good as Pho in VN. I also like C1- combination broken rice, it is so delicious. Yummy."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the flavor of the pho here.  It's a bit pricy for rice noodles and broth.  I have been in San Diego for the past 4 yrs and the price for a small bowl of pho is around $5.00 and that's San Diego.  The portions are large here but again it's still just basically rice noodles and broth.   I must admit that it is really tasty and I would rate it much higher if not for the cost."}
{"text":"Delicious lunch!  Must try!  We loved the stir fry!  The spring rolls were excellent.  Great food, so glad we found it!"}
{"text":"This place in my opinion the best Vietnamese food in Charlotte, it's not the greatest Vietnamese food I've ever eaten but it's good for Charlotte. We order the house special noodles and the house special rice and everything thing taste so good"}
{"text":"It is difficult to find really good Vietnamese food in North Carolina.  We were in the area and tried this place.  We were so happy to find a place with great food, reasonable prices, and exceptional service.  The three of us like different things. We got the Lemongrass Chicken, Seafood Pho, and Birds Nest Chicken.  All three dishes were great.  Out waitress was friendly, attentive, and efficient.  Saigon Bay will be on our go-to list from now on."}
{"text":"I don't know where to begin.  Okay.  The good was that the waitress was very polite. 

but it went down hill from there fast.  First I asked the waitress what veggies were in the tofu veggie dish.  She list 5 different veggies.  The dish came with just big slices of white onions, spring onions and big (as in needing to cut with a knife to get in my mouth) chunks of red bell pepper.  All vegetables were way undercooked.  The onions were like biting into a raw onion.  The dark sauce on the veggies and tofu tasted incredibly old.  Lots of old garlic flavor.  yuuuck.  and the rice on the plate had clearly been sitting in a pot or on the plate for hours.  No way it was recently cooked.

Summer rolls were also ordered.  There were some shrimp in them.....  four strands of noodles and the rest was all white lettuce.  There was no flavor, no spices like cilantro or mint, etc.  Bland.

I won't ever be back.  

I'm glad others are enjoying the place.  I must have just ordered the wrong dish.  My friend said her pho was good but nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"If you're looking for good Pho this is the place. Since I haven't had Pho since leaving California I wanted a large helping. The bowl size was just right and everything was fresh. Yes, I drank the broth. Definitely a hidden gem."}
{"text":"My brother has been talking about this place for awhile so I figured we give it a try since I was in town. I'm very skeptical about Vietnamese restaurants in general just because I grew up in California where there are tons of Vietnamese restaurants. First impression, nice location but what's up with the limited choices on the menu?

I ordered the combination bird nest (mi xao don thap cam) which was described to have chicken, beef, and seafood and a mixed of vegetables. The noodle was good, crunchy and light like how its supposed to be but then again, it's not hard to fry premade noodles and throw them on a plate. My protein consists 90% of chicken, 8% beef and 2% seafood and by \"seafood\", I mean 3 shrimps. Really? This was NOT the first time I've eaten the combination bird nest so I know for a fact there should be a lot more \"seafood\" than 3 lousy frozen shrimps. 

So maybe its just my food that was bad? Of course not... My friend ordered the bun thit nuong cha gio, which to me is probably one if the easiest dish to make, and that was a fail. She got ONE salty egg roll, decent meat, non-pickled \"pickled\" daikon and carrot, and hot vermicelli? Pretty sure traditional vermicelli supposed to be cooled off before served and the only thing that should be hot on that dish is the egg roll and the meat, but ok, maybe its an Asian \"fusion\" thing? 

The best thing there was probably the durian shake that my friend ordered and the super nice waitress. for a restaurant with limited choices, you would think they would perfect what little they're offerring. I would post a picture of what I ordered but after eating it, it was definitely not Instagram worthy so I deleted the picture. Sadly to say, I'm probably not going to spend anymore money here. Sorry Saigon Bay."}
{"text":"I had the Lemongrass Chicken and added tofu, it was great!  I love small wings.  All that to say, that if their wings were on the smaller side, I would have ordered them.  I really wanted some green tea ice cream, but they only had vanilla."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for Pho. They know me when I walk in which makes you feel great. I did slow down on my visits once the price for a regular bowl of pho went up. I also am not a fan of the service anymore. Overall I will go back and give them another try."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with this place! It's hard to come across a good pho restaurant and this one makes the list! I got the Pho Ga (chicken) and it was so good! The rest of my family ordered the Pho Dac Biet (beef) and they were appalled by how tasty it was! My mom definitely had reservations and had already prepared herself for mediocre Pho. We've had a lifetime of good and bad Pho endeavors. Had a great experience and the service was very nice. This is probably my new go to Pho place now whenever I'm in Charlotte! Would recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"I wish I could do half stars but if I can't then with this place I have to go down to four.  The food is awesome, what we have tried.  The main issue I have is that it is a bit overpriced in my opinion.  Also, they did not have the tall can sapporos on both of my visits.  When you only have a few beers and no taps, please try to keep them in stock and cold!

We have tried spring rolls, pho and noodles.  All were great.  The meat portions are a bit small for what you pay but quality and flavor are excellent.  Give this place a try, you won't regret it.  I highly recommend it over the other nearby pho place that says they are real."}
{"text":"Best pho I've had in awhile and I'm picky about my pho! Service was excellent. We called ahead and our food was there when we got there. Waitress was super friendly. Will definitely be visiting a lot more often."}
{"text":"Delicious food and one of the best Vietnamese restaurants in the university area. Ordered the lemongrass beef (B4) and everything was cooked to perfection with a good helping of beef and peppers. Roommates ordered the Pho, and it looked amazing, probably going to order it next time I visit. Highly recommended this restaurant."}
{"text":"Had the vermicelli pork bowl.  Good flavor, although the pork was a little charred. 
Great service and nice relaxed atmosphere. 
Definitely worth the visit especially since they have Tiger beer (yes, I know it is not top shelf stuff, but after time in Asia, I crave it)"}
{"text":"One of the best Vietnamese restaurants in Charlotte. Their pho is lip smacking  good! Comes out perfectly seasoned all you need to add is sriracha to your spice  preference. My favorite, the spicy beef noodles soup (Bun bo hue) is on point , down to the last drop. The new Owners are awesome and friendly. They came in and really turned the business around, especially through their food. Keep it up Saigon Bay!"}
{"text":"Found this place almost by accident t while at a nearby hotel at a gaming convention.  Excellent service and the food is amazingly delicious.  Highly recommend B-1."}
{"text":"I ordered the Pho Tai ( steak pho) and my boyfriend had the Bun Bo Hue. No need to mention about how good of the broth and the meat were (they were exceptional), they even had the fresh small red chilis which is perfect for vietnamese dishes(though you have to ask for them). I would give this restaurant 4.5 stars, but since there's no such option this place deserves 5. Anything not good about this place is just minor ( they dont have some special vietnamese herbs and veggies)
I would recommend people to try the deep fried quail as the apertizer. It was so amazing. You need to mix the pepper salt with lime juice and the fresh hot red chili ( if you can't handle the spiciness from the fresh chili, can use the siracha sauce too). The quail was marinated perfectly and they were all so crispy. 
For the drink I had the bubble tea with avocado. Its so fresh and tasty. It's not too sweet like other drinks I have had in the usa.
I loved this place and definitely would like to come back to try their hotpot"}
{"text":"This location may have gotten more than 1 star if i was able to taste the food. I  ordered a dish to exclude a few ingredients due to dietary restrictions. When dish came to the table there was an ingredient included that i am unable to eat. So i mentioned that to the waitress and unfortunately made the assumption that a new dish would be served. No such thing.....the 15 minutes it took her to check on us she returned with no food. O waited for an additional 15 minutes and nothing. I cancelled the order. There was no apology, the waitress actually chuckled when i cancelled the order. Our family loves to try new and support our local businesses however this restaurant we will not be returning to. The lack of concern for their patrons doesnt deserve our money."}
{"text":"Pho was greasy very very greasy. Appetizers good and server friendly plus very helpful. At end of meal saw 2 roaches. Did not take leftovers. Should have told staff but just wanted to leave. Ran away. Called to let someone know but they were closed. Hope they get an exterminator. 2 stars for amazing server."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite pho place in CLT area. The broth is so delicious sometimes I want to drink the broth too, lol my husband always stops me. Hahaha. 

But yes the pho broth is great, doesn't need much more, maybe just a bit of Sriracha for your spice liking or hoisin for sweetness. 

The vermicelli salad is also very good, love their quality of meats. Also try their grilled pork summer rolls, fried egg rolls are great too. 

Sometimes service can be slow because i think they're a bit understaffed for a place that is always busy when I'm there but I don't mind bc it hasn't been extremely long waits or bad service, as long as I get my food. Lol."}
{"text":"Great spring and summer rolls, although a little overpriced.  The hot pot for $30-35 is well worth it.  I'll be back to try the pho.

It was an interesting experience.  When we ordered our hot pot our server put down a not quite folded up creative loafing under one side to try and \"level it out\".  For one thing, this kind of made one side spring loaded and another, I'm thinking anything would be better than a creative loafing.  I mean, I guess a bottle of liquor or a gas can might be more of a fire hazard.  She ended up finding a different burner after we kind of laughed at her.

We got the seafood hotpot.  Everything was great, but if you aren't an experienced cook, you might not find this as your best option.  Mussels, scallops, shrimp, and calamari are all very finicky on cook times.  The fish balls and veggies are much more forgiving.

A great meal, but like I said, we knew how to cook our seafood.  I'll be back and back again."}
{"text":"Excellent food, but horrible service. Pho is one of my favorite things and I usually go to another Vietnamese restaurant in town for it, but I thought I would try some place new. I was not disappointed with the Pho. It was  richer and more flavorful than my other favorite Pho place, but it took forever to get our food. Then once the food did arrive, the waitress disappeared. Even when we finished our meal it took forever to get the check and some take out container for our leftovers.

Good portions, delicious food and horrible service. If the service was better it would have been a 4.5 star review."}
{"text":"The servers are terrific. The pho is excellent. A little salty but just perfect in many ways. The summer rolls are superb. The red bean ice cream a bit icy. You need more turnover of this product."}
{"text":"This place was Yelp lunch pick on a business trip. What a great Vietnamese restaurant! The meat is grilled tender and smoky, the veggies are fresh and crisp, the noodles are perfectly cooked. So good it makes me want to travel on business here more often!"}
{"text":"This is my very first post ever on yelp. The reason I am giving 2 stars is because the lemongrass beef was yummy but that is it. 
I ordered the vermicelli with lemongrass beef. They brought me Pho. I told the waiter this is not what I ordered he repeated my order back and then realized my order was wrong. 
Then brought me the right order except everything that come with the dish lettuce peanuts cucumber etc was not on my dish. 
After all that he gave me a $.90 cent discount."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good and the pork summer rolls are bomb af. But for some reason when I come here the service is always top tier trash. 9/10 chance my appetizers come out after my entree which is disappointing. I always have to hunt down the server to get a refill. Might as put in a water fountain so I can just get it myself. Waiting forever for a check or to get my card back. It's so bad and I've been coming here since they open since the food is good but management seriously needs to do something about this. It's starting to get to the point where I'm considering not coming back. There are plenty of other pho places with pho just as good or better I can go to with way better service."}
{"text":"This place is LEGIT! A lot of Vietnamese places in my area really only just do the pho (and maybe vermicelli) well, but this place also does some other, less popular Vietnamese dishes.

+ The large pho is MASSIVE. It could maybe feed 3-4 people (and I might suggest eating it this way and going family style on a few other dishes so your dinner isn't just one note consisting of a giant pot of pho)
+ Generous portions of greens, with culantro? which isn't always offered at some pho places
+ The salted limeade drink was an adventure! Definitely a more traditional Vietnamese drink that is an acquired taste. It might be more refreshing to drink on a hot day, I think.
~ Baby clams with sesame cracker. YES! Fun to eat and delectable--my family really descended on this plate. Really popular with us. However, I think it could have used more of an acidic element.
~ Knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful service (our waitress was nice enough to give us another cracker on the house), but could use a little more confidence.
- The spring and summer rolls were a little pricey to me, but maybe it's because I usually buy them cheaply at fast food Viet places... Pho was just over $8, rolls were closer to $3-4 for small portions and vermicelli and other dishes over $10.

In summary, this place is worth a visit. Oh, and the bathrooms are super nice. ALWAYS a big +plus there. The atmosphere overall is relaxed, well-lit, spacious, with some pretty details. Keep it up Saigon Bay!"}
{"text":"I really like it here! It's great for the University area :) The food is actually pretty fresh and the music is great!   Pho is good :)"}
{"text":"We headed here the other night, craving food that would warm our souls and the answer is always Pho but the nice surprise is that they have killer banh mi sandwiches and bubble tea. We each ordered a sandwich and split a Pho and it hit the spot. I had the Korean pork banh mi and my husband had the BBQ pork. Great prices and good food."}
{"text":"The food was good but this place seems to misunderstand your orders unless you make it super clear. For example, I ordered two different kinds of summer rolls: shrimp and pork.  I was expecting a shrimp roll and a pork roll. Well....instead I got two summer rolls with both shrimp and pork in it. Ha! I did not expect that. 

Compare to Pho real.... food and service was much better with a lot bigger portion size."}
{"text":"I love this place for my Phò fix!!!!! I've dined in a few times, but normally just get takeout because of my schedule. They are always accommodating, packing extra sauces and toppings for the Phò. My boyfriend likes the beef with lemongrass dish, and I've finally converted him into a Phò eater after 4years of being together :) On my most recent visit one of the servers was very gracious, adding a piece of chocolate cake to my takeout order, she said they had leftovers from an employee's birthday celebration. I appreciate how friendly the staff is and the food is always delicious!"}
{"text":"Vermicelli with roasted pork was bomb. Servers need to understand all played should come out together. Otherwise, the service wasn't that bad. Really enjoyed the food. Nice and clean!"}
{"text":"I had an extremely pleasant dinner at Saigon Bay last night.

My wife and I shared the soft summer rolls, the crispy spring rolls, and the 4 spice hot pot.

First off, this place SMELLS amazing. You don't have to even walk in the door to start feeling excited for an awesome meal. 

Our summer rolls were giant, soft, delicious... like a bun burrito. Highly recommend. 

The hot pot was MASSIVE. I have to be honest and say that this was my first time with a vietnamese hot pot, and I... well.. I was a bit intimidated. It was different than a japanese shabu shabu where you kind of throw everything in and go for it. 

There were new devices... wire baskets... I dunno. I just never felt like I was doing the right thing. Our server was very pleasant, and whenever I asked for clarification, or guidance, she told us that we can do it however we feel like we should.. which is lovely, and open ended. I feel like I needed a real hot pot veteran to hold my hand. 

It was a TON of food, and for a very fair price. I'm thrilled that we chose Saigon Bay."}
{"text":"3 STARS only because the decor was nice, the Pho was good, and the Bun Bo Hue was tasty.
BUT...
Spring rolls were falling apart as you ate them. Needs to be rolled tighter.
Chicken wings were undercooked. Not just slightly, I mean there was a chunk of meat next to the bone that was still raw.
Service was pretty bad. Server was either inexperienced or indifferent. Maybe both. But just not friendly at all.
Visited on a Tuesday, between lunch and dinner. So there was nobody else there.
However, it still took well over 15 minutes just to get appetizers, that were not fully cooked. And an additional 20 minutes for the pho and bbh.
An average visit to a restaurant like this usually takes around 45 mins. We were here at 2:40, when we sat down in the car, it was 4:05.
 
So bad service, long wait, good food."}
{"text":"Food was okay.. they really need to do something about the interior ...the Furniture is horrible and it's dirty they need to clean it up a little bit... clean the  Windows too...update the place a little bit"}
{"text":"One of the good restaurants in the University area where you never get bored of their food. My suggestions are pho ga, lemon grass chicken, springs rolls, fried rice"}
{"text":"Healthy and yummy.  Not the best I've ever had, but very good.  Shrimp/ Spring rolls were outstanding--I'd have those again any day, maybe a double order as the full meal.  Decent wine selections, good service.  Wasn't wild about the wide noodle recipe---they were kind of stuck together so we avoided them, but the shrimp were generous and tasty and the fresh veggies were good too."}
{"text":"About a year ago, the quality and service here was awesome.  Now, the service is horrible and they have gone completely stingy on the quantity and quality for things like meat.  I used to like this place so much, I've brought & recommended my co-workers here who wanted to try Vietnamese dishes for the first time.  4 times, we ended up waiting like 30 minutes to get our food, let alone another 30 minutes to get our appetizer and 10 minutes to have a waitress/waiter come over to place an order.  The last time I went there and ordered Bun Bo He and asked for extra blood cubes for which they charged me, I only got 3 in the entire soup.  Then my co-worker got 2-3 slices of beef in his pho?  Like really??  Not to mention, our spring roll came with fish sauce and the fish sauce cup still had the freaking price tag on it.... I am assuming the cup was not even washed prior to using it for customers since there were no signs of paper deterioration from rinsing or cleaning.  My co-worker had the exact same price tag on his.  So today, I ordered food to go for my family and I.  We ordered  Bun Dac Biet and seriously...got about 4 pieces of small cut spam, 6 thin slices of bbq pork and the rest was cold noodles....  Now, I can handle disappointment 4 or 5 times for myself and embarrassment for recommending this place to my coworkers, but since I got this for my parents as well.... and they got something like this piece of **** for an entrée I paid for more than what was provided..umm NO I am never going back nor do I recommend anyone eating here.  3 times should have been shame on me."}
{"text":"Great family operation, friendly staff, great value.  Solid offerings covering Pho, Bun, Noodle Dishes and Rice Dishes.  Drinks are pretty expensive though at $4.50 for Thai Tea and Vietnamese Coffee.  Limited offerings of Bubble Tea also priced at $4.50.

The Pho is priced at $10 for a Medium bowl and $12 for the large bowl, I did not even finish my medium bowl.  Broth is rich and flavorful while the noodles can be a bit on the thin side.  Interested in trying the Hot Pot soon so we will return."}
{"text":"Loved all the food and drinks! We got the hibachi style hot pot, calamari, and fried quails. The quail was probably my favorite, perfectly cooked and seasoned. The décor and furniture is okay, they really are trying. Obviously a family run joint. Service was a bit slow, but it was a busy Saturday night. It was perfect for the price. Will be coming back for the pho, which was obviously the hot ticket item, everyone else was getting it."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese food in Charlotte! Bun dac biet is THE BEST. I've tried many Viet spots in the greater Charlotte area and this is the best."}
{"text":"Nice, belly warming pho especially on cold, wintry days.  Deep, well-developed flavors enticed my spoon for more until I was full.  The $10 regular size is huge giving me a take home, too.

Saigon Bay reminds me of wandering the hill in San Francisco somewhere between Pacific Ave and Broadway.  The sounds and smells common to many Asian cultures can be found here.

Is it everything you might expect?  Probably, no.  But if you're in the mood for a bowl of pho, go here.  I say, Give 'em a whirl."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm craving Pho, this is where I go. If you're in the University area and looking for Vietnamese, skip the others (I'm looking at you, Pho Real) and head here. It's very authentic. It gives me nostalgia for my Vietnamese host family from an exchange program. They have a wide variety of non-pho dishes, all of which have generous portions and taste delicious. I would also recommend the Vietnamese coffee. It comes in a little pot with sweetened condensed milk, which you pour over ice. Lovely."}
{"text":"Everything was extremely salty. We ended up not putting any condiments in our pho for that reason. The pho broth was over powering with too much star anise. Will not be going back. We will make the drive farther to Central for pho."}
{"text":"Ambiance/decor-3
Service-5
Food-3
Strikeouts-0/3

Simple viet pho restaurant located on the boardwalk. It wasn't anything fancy, but the waitress was very energetic! I quickly ordered my P1 pho and my rolls. Nothing special or out of the ordinary, but the quality of the standard dishes is what makes a good pho place better than others. 

This place was average at best on all fronts, the sauce was good, the roll was a bit bland and dry. The soup base tasted really good for the pho, but I knew was high on MSG since I was consistently thirsty afterwards. The amount of ingredients are plentiful which is a plus. The quality was a bit below average, but it is hard to beat Toronto viet pho places. All and all, if you need a pho fix and decent pricing, come here!!"}
{"text":"very bad service. I found the water is dirty after I drink half of the bottle, then the server just come to change one without say a sorry! I asked why there are so many floater in the water, they said \"because the cup is not clean\", then I asked \" why the cup is not clean\", they say \"because they does not wash carefully\", that's all, they did Not feel guilty at all.  I am worried for my health now and I do not know what is the floater I drink"}
{"text":"After one pho lunch I wasn't sure if I was ready to give Saigon Bay five stars - that's a big deal people!

My \"regular\" portion of pho was plenty and plenty delicious. I opted for P2- filet and the meat was sliced thin and came raw in my to-go package as to not over cook in the hot broth.

The to-go order was ready quickly and packaged well for transport. Saigon Bay is in front of Sushi 101 - in case you were turned around like I got.

A bowl of love that will satisfy any pho craving- can't wait to try them again and truly rave."}
{"text":"I was in town from New York for a few days. Figure I try one of my favorite Tofu dishes here at Saigon Bay. The vibe was quiet guess because it was a Monday after 1pm. Server was very nice. So I ordered my fav Tofu & Lemongrass over rice. I had to say it was pretty good , came very close only thing is I guess the lemon grass was too cooked cause it getting stuck in my teeth. But my taste buds were very satisfied I will return. I would of given another start but the dish was a bit much, and they had to club soda ?"}
{"text":"Always good and fresh. My new thing is the grilled pork spring rolls.. Love it but I'm confused Bc first time I ordered it they had the grilled pork and shrimp then second time I ordered them it had no shrimp?? So do it come with shrimp or no?? Bc it was delicious with the shrimp. Without it, was good but missing something. 
Pho is always on point and the Bun vermicelli is awesome....."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I stop here for lunch and we really enjoyed it. The service was fast and the food served here was great. The restaurant is a bit small but other than that the overall experience was great. I would recommend stoping here if you have a chance."}
{"text":"The servers were nice and helpful. This was the second time my daughter and I went and we enjoyed it. Each time trying different foods, but always have the pho. We share a regular because it is so much. I recommend the Vietnamese ice coffee to end your meal."}
{"text":"PH ?C BIT was the perfect flavor.  I think the brisket pieces were too chewy - you had to chew them and then give up and take a big swallow.  Next time I might stick to the meatballs."}
{"text":"Good pho, authentic tasting. Broth has great flavor. I always get Pho Tai, and this place definitely made it so good. My server provided excellent service. Would go again :)"}
{"text":"Saigon Bay is such a good place for pho or Vietnamese food! They also have hot pot, which I've yet to try. But I have tried the pho and vermicelli bowls, and I LOVE them both. The spring rolls are delicious as well. The portioning is great. You get more than enough for what you pay for! The vermicelli bowls are fresh and the meat is sooo tasty. The broth in the pho is delicious and flavorful. They give you so much meat! Which is unusual in most restaurants. I would definitely recommend Saigon Bay if you are visiting Charlotte or the Boardwalk area. My boyfriend doesn't eat Asian food, and he LOVES the chicken pho here at Saigon Bay!!"}
{"text":"Look for this gem set off the main road in a shopping center. We stopped by for dinner on a long drive home. Even though the shopping mall atmosphere seems like a canned community, we found authentic flavor at Saigon Bay. There was no wait when we arrived but tables filled quickly. It seems a testament to the authentic quality of the food that we were the only entirely WASPy table at the time. 

The food was delicious with fresh veggies and leafy greens. I asked for and took my servers recommendation - so pleased I did. I was forewarned that the crepe would be difficult to eat, and it was. However, even tough I Stumbled handling unfamiliar food with seldom used chop sticks, I never felt uncomfortable or self conscious. Service was warm, friendly and fast."}
{"text":"The waitress was very friendly, my BF asked if they had banana boba tea which they didn't but she offered to add a fresh banana in the coconut flavored boba tea which came out really good! We both got pho and it was really good! This is my new pho spot now. Broth was delicious."}
{"text":"Pretty solid Vietnamese restaurant. In fact, it's downright delicious! Definitely Southern/Saigon style (duh... it's in the name), so sweeter and lots of cinnamon. Pretty starry, plus nice decor, and great location."}
{"text":"I had their crispy quail as an appetizer and a large pho. The quail was cooked perfectly. It was served with a small dish of salt and ground black pepper, but the quail was already perfectly seasoned. I was almost full from eating the quail when I started on the soup. The pho was very good. The two young servers were both friendly and attentive. The restaurant was pleasantly decorated and somewhat relaxing. I would definitely recommend this restaurant and would return next time I'm back in town."}
{"text":"Great Pho, they aren't stingy with their meat or noodles or bean sprouts. They have the best chili oil! If you eat super super super spicy they got the best pper oil"}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte and craving for some pho so I decided to give Saigon Bay a visit since my Uncle raved about this place. So my first impression walking in was it's a lot smaller than I thought it would be. But that doesn't really matter cause we're all just here for the food. Anyways, we got sat at a half booth table and let me tell you, that booth seat was so uncomfortable but I didn't want to go through the hassle of having our waitress move us to a different table so I just put my big girl panties on and sucked it up. Lol. 

So like I said before, I ended up ordering the pho and when I received the pho it looked delicious. The waitress was very accommodating and brought us the extra limes we asked for and chili oil. She was also on point at refilling our drinks making sure we wasn't slurping the bottom of our cups. 

I tried plenty of pho places in Charlotte and even though none of these pho compares to the pho place back in Hickory, I honestly think Saigon Bay has the best pho that I've tasted in Charlotte. 

By the way, it's right on the Boardwalk so that's always a plus. What better than to take a stroll around the boardwalk after all that food. This will be my go to pho place whenever I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"WOW- what an improvement man. I remembered coming here about 2 years ago and it was just tasted mediocre to me. I decided to give it another go just because I was near the area & was in the mood for some vermicelli. I ordered the tofu bun(noodles) & lemme tell ya it was BOMB. Probably the one of the best bun I had, the sauce that came with the noodles was perfection. Tofu was crispy & marinated and I liked how my noodles weren't completely like smothered in the sauce. My mom ordered the hu tieu tofu stir fry, I tried some of it, and it was good. I didn't like how her noodles were completely drenched in the sauce though, it made it a little too salty. Whenever I'm in the mood for some bommmb bun, I'll be sure to come back!! The service was also very nice too!! (:"}
{"text":"This is an updated review. This pho restaurant has really stepped up their game and made their name quite well known. I will say 9 out of 10 times, I will always enjoy the pho since one time it was very bad to where I just cannot finish the pho. But overall, this place will be one of my top choices to go."}
{"text":"I love Pho! I have tried many pho restaurants. Pho is my husbands speciality because he makes awesome pho! Ok so we went here for lunch and you can smell the beefy pho aroma outside already. As soon as we came in we got seated. The place was clean, customer traffic slow, the decor contemporary. We Only order 2 medium bowls of beef pho . It came out in 8 minutes. The 2 best thing is the pho beef broth was very good and the noodles and beef portion were generous! Reason; I could not finish all my noodles & meat, lol and that never happens. This medium bowl was really a large in my opinion. I would def recommend and come back to eat pho here.
Service, I didn't expect much from Asian pho restaurants even in a upscale place at University.
She disappeared and did not come back til we asked her for our bill.... It's too bad great food can't meet with great service too. Great pho!!!"}
{"text":"Me coming from Boston and Atlanta where there are many great restaurant. I can honestly say Saigon Bay is one of the few restaurant in charlette that does not let down on taste. The portion are more then genorous. Everything that is served taste and looks so fresh. Even with the location that they are at, the meal pricing is rediculously cheap too. Trust me, as a member of #TeamFataAzz. You can never go wrong with our review!"}
{"text":"Little bit further than we wanted to travel but definitely worth the drive. The place is located in front of the boardwalk and upon arrival we were a little hesitant since it wasn't too busy for a Saturday night. Hubby opted for Bun Bo Hue and the broth is definitely one of the best we've had in a restaurant. Nice and sweet, not msg sweet but sweet from soup bones. I opted for Pho Tai Bo Vien. Perfect portion and soup broth was excellent. Just the right amount of fattiness in the broth. Our toddler got the plain fried rice with egg and it was cooked perfectly. Our waitress was so sweet and kind. Reason for the four instead of five stars is because the place could be a little cleaner."}
{"text":"My husband and I went off the beaten path to try Saigon Bay today!  I had wisdom teeth surgery and got eating is real limited right now, and I wanted some Pho or some kind of broth soup.  I had a coupon, so we ended up here, and we were both extremely pleased with the choice!

I got vegetable Pho, he got a rice noodle dish.  We both really enjoyed our meals.  My Pho was served in a literal mixing bowl...huge!  I got the large because I planned to take leftovers home, which I had plenty to do so.  It was served with a size of Thai basil, cilantro, lime and jalapeño.  Not sure what another poster was saying that theirs didn't, maybe the server forgot?  My soup had a ton of veggies, I was really impressed!  My husband also really liked his dish and it filled him up.  Great portion sizes!  

This is located in the Boardwalk area of University.  It was really busy on this Friday night.  Nice little outside patio that we enjoyed.  We will be back, maybe for bubble tea!"}
{"text":"I'm very satisfied with Saigon! I got the tofu with mixed veggies, good portion and great flavor. My coworkers each got pho and said the broth was wonderful. This is gonna be a new lunch spot for me and my coworkers!"}
{"text":"I always come here for some good home-cooked Vietnamese food. The pho here is good. It's all about the broth. Most restaurants just throw in a seasoning packet. The light film of oil in the broth indicates that they actually spend time with it."}
{"text":"Stopped in yesterday after hearing ravings about this place.  
Was greeted by staff at the door who made me feel more like a friend, than a customer.  Great Start.  Friendly staff who shared the taste of the restaurant with me.
Ordered the Bird's Nest, and a starter of Quail. 
As a first time guest was very impressed with the time spent explaining the menu, and helping to no end with explaining the flavors of the meals on the menu.  Can't put into words the world of flavors and tastes of the dishes i ordered.  Simply Great experience.
Looking forward to making it a regular stop on my days and nights out.
By the way.  Great location too."}
{"text":"I'm in Charlotte on business and was craving Vietnamese food. Saigon Bay was across the street from the hotel. 

For an impulse visit I am pleasantly surprised. I sat at the bar once I saw they had my two favorite congacs, Hennessey VSOP & Remy Martin 1738. 

I ordered the kid sized Pho Dac Biet and the bird's nest. Both were very tasty. 

Kim and Phoa, my awesome servers for the evening, were exactly that. Kind, competent,  and cool. They even recommended some place for me to hang out while in Charlotte. 

I would definitely come back and recommend it to anyone interested in trying it. 

; p"}
{"text":"this place is awesome! They offer enough noodles for each size! Like it! Much quicker than Pho real! More noodles than Pho real! I like this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Was on my way to Love Sushi and passed this place and very glad that I changed my mind and went there instead.  I sat at the bar and enjoyed the company of both the bartender and the owner?  I ordered the crispy pork vermicelli and it was excellent!  I told them that I was from Atlanta that has a Vietnamese restaurant that I love - this was just as good.   I finished with a coconut bubble tea, very good too!  I get through Charlotte once a month for business and now have my favorite place in this town.  So nice to have a great meal and not from a chain."}
{"text":"Food is good and quantity is alot!
Nice area to sit out and chit chat with your friends and family. 
Chicken and veggie in basil thai."}
{"text":"This place has pretty bad service. The waitress didn't seem to understand what we ordered and brought 4 out of the 5 orders out incorrectly. We had the goi cuon which was just lettuce, vermicelli and 2 pieces of shrimp- nothing special and only served with a literal drop of sauce. You need more sauce for 2 rolls! We also had the Com dac biet where the meat was too sweet and pho. The pho broth wasn't bad but they served us dac biet style with all the gross tripe and tendon when we asked for just rare meat and meatballs. Also, what kind of place doesn't serve veggie accompaniments to the pho??? Lime, bean sprouts, jalapeños: all necessities to complete the pho experience!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time at Saigon Bay, and I will say that I really had a VERY hard time contacting them. My plan was to order my food a head of time so I would not have to wait during lunch time. I called three time from the number listed on here as I was reviewing all the reviews and no one answered. The first time someone picked up then hung up, and I said to myself maybe they are extremely busy. I called again and it continued to ring and ring same as the third time. SO I still decided to go because I was craving some Pho and its cold and rainy today.

When I arrive I was expecting it to be a MAD HOUSE.... however there were all of 5 people inside and that included the servers. I immediately asked, \"do you all not accept order during lunch time?\" She replied yes we do why? I explained that I have tried calling multiple times to plan a to go order. After providing my thoughts on this situation my food came out within 7 minutes, During that time I had the opportunity to look around the restaurant. It wasn't as clean as I would have liked, and I will suggest that they spend sometime reorganizing and cleaning their bar area a little more. Being that the bar is the FIRST thing you see when walking into the doors, and you can see behind the bar its not appealing at all. 

This is my feed back on my first experience at Saigon Bay, I maybe back only if I'm able to order over the phone to save time and if I'm craving Pho while at work.."}
{"text":"Good authentic Vietnamese. Had the pork chop dinner. Very authentic and tasty. Service was quick and efficient. Staff very pleasant and prices reasonable. I will definitely be back. Also ordered a bang mi to go. That was just average."}
{"text":"Pho is flavorful, good portion size for the money, and the basil and bean sprouts are always fresh...some pho places can give you old wrinkly greens which is my pet peeve. The meat, tripe, and tendon in the pho is just the right amount too! My new pho spot!"}
{"text":"Mediocre Vietnamese food and the same goes  for service. Server brought food but no utensils. Had for it utensils and twice to have water refilled. There are many Vietnamese restaurants now in Charlotte and I consider this one of the worse. I have friends that travel from out of town and always ask for Vietnamese food. I can't recommend this one. I have eaten at Saigon Bay three times and this last visit will be my last."}
{"text":"I really wanted some pho soup.  But my favorite place was closed for the day.  This place is just ok.  The broth was not very flavorful.   The restaurant was not very clean the day we went."}
{"text":"Found this place while traveling through Charlotte. Great atmosphere and great service. The B2 and B1 were amazing - flavorful meats and the house sauce was perfect!"}
{"text":"Came home to visit and my friend took me here to try. Let's just say I wouldn't go here again unless I was craving for a durian sake and it's near by. I order the bun thit nuong cha gio (noodles with charbroiled pork and egg rolls) which I would say it shouldn't be hard to mess up for any Vietnamese people. I got one egg with it and it was SALTY! The what supposed to be pickled daikon and carrot taste like it just got chopped and put into my bowl. The pork was also salty, but not as bad since it'll give it some flavor. This will most likely be black listed."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try the other evening. Entrance to the place was a bit confusing because it had two sets of doors.  No hour display or \"OPEN\" neon sign either.

Tried the papaya salad....not impressed.  Pho was okay.  Had way too much beef tripe which I dont care for.  I will stick to my usual spot, even though it's across town."}
{"text":"I had never had pho before coming here and must say it was pho-king amazing...lol...I had to do it. Anyway, The broth was wonderful and all of the ingredients tasted so fresh. I can't imagine it being better anywhere else but I definitely be trying this lovely dish again. This will probably be one of my go to meals as we head into the cold winter months."}
{"text":"Saigon Bay is very clean. The staff is very friendly. I had the noodle special. It had very tasty meats and excellent noodles. I also had an order of wings that had a nice sauce on it which tasted like a combination of sesame oil and ginger. The wife and I had a very good experience for our first visit."}
{"text":"Yummy, quick, and friendly.  Phasing out liquor drinks though.  Fresh roll appetizer was delight.  Good vermicelli shrimp bowl."}
{"text":"I had the Pho Dac Biet. Simply amazing dish. Filet mignon, brisket, tendon, meatball, flank, and tripe. Again did I say amazing. I had the regular size and it was plenty. The taste took me back to a place of great home cooked meals. I will be coming back as soon as possible. This place is my new pho home. I love Saigon Bay. Go and enjoy some great food."}
{"text":"I have been back here 4 times since recently discovering this place. So far it is my favorite place for Vietnamese in Charlotte. It's really delicious!"}
{"text":"The pho is good! We also got the rice plate with pork chop which is also good. The service was a hit and miss. One time it took forever to get our meals and the next time it was super fast."}
{"text":"This little Vietnamese place by the Boardwalk at University seems like it still has some work to do and areas to improve on, but it wasn't a bad place. I didn't expect much walking in but was surprised.

I only tried the pho (pho dac biet) so I can't speak to any of the other dishes, but the pho was surprisingly good. The broth is rich without being too fatty, noodles were not over or undercooked. The amount of meat was proportional to the amount of noodles. The \"regular\" sized bowl is plenty of food and already a large portion. The \"large\" is huge! Only get that if you've got a large appetite. 

The tables don't come with extra napkins, chopsticks, or spoons like typical pho joints and the plates of herbs are scant on the basil. If catering to a more Americanized crowd, this is fine, though I typically enjoy large amounts of greens and toppings for my pho. But they were fresh and the limes were juicy, so that's a pro.

My cousin tried the bun bo hue and asked it to be extra spicy, and though I didn't try it myself she did not enjoy her dish and thought it lacking in spicy-ness, even after she added in the sate (chili sauce)

The service was quick but very average. Waiters/foodrunners are young HS aged and lacking confidence/experience, but I wouldn't expect any more than this. I don't need exceptional service in a place like this anyway. 

I wouldn't mind going back for pho if in the area!"}
{"text":"Love this place for the pho. It's probably one of the best places to get pho in Charlotte honestly. The only thing I have to complain about is the service it's usually a hit or miss depending on who the server is."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed Pho and my wife has never had a chance to try it. I am glad that I brought her here. Not only did they take the time to explain what was in the dish and how it was made they helped her try something that she has never experienced before. A great place to get pho and a wonderful staff"}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend here for lunch. Had some pho and the spring rolls with grilled pork. Authentic, spicy and delicious. Our server Kenny was knowledgeable, accommodating, and friendly. Affordable too. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"My favorite spot for Pho.  I tried other places and I like this one the best.

Parking is plentiful but you have to walk a little bit.

They have nice big spoons with a hook on the end that don't fall into your bowl."}
{"text":"Was craving some vermicelli after having flown for way too many hours. My sister looked up this spot, and DAMN...No joke, I think the best Viet food I've ever had!! We had Bun Dac Biet (we contemplated getting another one as we started eating, it's that good) and Banh Xeo (make sure to eat it with all the veg, herbs, fish sauce and a drop of sriracha).

Great food, great prices ($12 and $10respectively), amazing service, free WiFi, and adorable women's bathroom. Liked it so much it finally pushed me to write my first ever yelp review!

We might actually come back here for dinner tonight :D"}
{"text":"Well, this is a first. No, seriously, this is the first time I've had Vietnamese food. I kinda wish I'd tried it before going vegan...so now as a vegetarian (long story) I couldn't taste any of the Pho the other Yelpers were raving about. Nonetheless, no animals were harmed in the making of my meal so we're all good. For starters we had custom spring rolls with tofu and the wonderful delicious peanut sauce. Mmmn mnnnn, I could drink a whole dayum bottle of that! Speaking of bottles, hubs wanted a beer so he ordered the Saigon Export (which they didn't have), then he ordered the Tiger beer, which they also didn't have so he ended up with Lucky Buddah. He enjoyed the beer but they definitely need to update the beer menu. For my meal, I had the Tofu Vermicelli and it was very tasty.  It was alot of food so I ended up bringing some home to pack for lunch tomorrow. Bonus!! Hubs had the Tofu and Vegetables and judging by the dishwasher clean plate he left on the table, I would say that he thoroughly enjoyed it! I wanted to try one of the bubble teas but didn't have room for it so I'll definitely try it next time. My waiter was cool, (I think he was new), but he answered our questions well and took care of us. I'll definitely be back especially when I have more experience in the Vietnamese cuisine."}
{"text":"First time eating here, my husband and I got pho. Second time friends and I got various items. My friend and I both got rice dishes (C3-grilled chicken and C4-grilled pork and shrimp.) The chicken wing appetizer was yummy, but I think next time I'll get the C4 with the charbroiled pork chop since the grilled pork almost tastes gamey, like goat. Service was great as always and the restaurant was clean. Look forward to going back and trying the summer rolls. Thai tea is always a favorite."}
{"text":"Been here 5 times and I can say that the food is either a hit or miss.  This time around I ordered the \"Com Dac Biet\", which consists of a pork chop, shredded pork skin, quiche, egg and egg roll.

What I wasn't expecting was a burnt-dried quiche, a small hair presumably head hair and another ahem* hair.

I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a place that serves hot pot ever since Dynasty Cuisine closed, and now after 3 years i FINALLY found it!
We had the Four Spices Hot Pot for two, and it was delicious if you like spices. If not, they have a couple other options too.
The place is very well kept, and the servers are friendly and attentive. The decor is very warm and welcoming. We didn't try anything else here, but the food that other customers ordered looked good and they seemed to enjoy it.
They also have boba tea that they serve in sealed cups.
Yay for this place, I'm glad to have found a great hot pot place finally."}
{"text":"Had dinner here the other day. Food was good and service was good. Not the best looking place but the food made up for it. Pho was excellent. And the food came out fast. Never usually too busy in there."}
{"text":"Hooray Pho :)

I'm a huge pho fan, and I was really happy to find a good place that served it in Charlotte. I got the pho with filet mignon and the fried spring rolls."}
{"text":"I read the current Creative Loafing review and had to give this place a try. The review made the pho sound out of this world so I had to order it. I would say it was tasty but not out of this world like the review made it seem. I also didn't like the way the beef meatballs were cut in to skinny little silvers. Pho Bò Vien is my favorite and I really notice the meatballs and the way they are presented. The menu isn't very large but I believe they do a good job on the items they serve. My friend ordered the Hieu Tu with chicken and it was delish. I have to return and try the nuoc nam chicken wings!!!"}
{"text":"It's like Pho Real famous for its pho or noodles. But waitress here are nicer and check out quicker. Bright and clean environment but too cold with the A/C. The soup of noodle soup is really awesome, better than Pho Real, but Pho Real has more noodles choices, which I would give one more star. And the bowl of large size is like a small basin lol."}
{"text":"Not too shabby. I've had much better Vietnamese food, but it definitely wasn't the worst. 

The dishes we ordered were the BBQ pork rice plate and the pho. My dish was delicious, but the pho was not as meaty and full of tasty broth.

I also ordered the mango and durian boba teas, and I've definitely had better. The drinks tasted very fake, more like powder. This place would definitely not be my first choice for Vietnamese."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but their broth sucks ! I grew up with a family that knows flavor and their broth taste like they addded water to it . I literally had to put a lot of seasonings .. disgusting place ever !!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in after a day wandering around with the wife. Bun Bo hue was on point. Fried chicken and tofu was great as well.  Staff are friendly and inviting.  We're pretty tentative.  Will be stopping by again in the future."}
{"text":"Not an expert on Vietnamese food but I know what I like. 
Went over lunch - wasn't mad crazy busy
Service was great and fast
Pho was excellent - had the seafood with shrimp, squid and cod balls
Place was clean
Paid $12 for regular sized Pho and a drink. 
I would go there again"}
{"text":"Best Pho in Charlotte. Great portions. It's about a dollar more than competitors but it is worth it. They converted me from pho an hoa, which is now my second favorite."}
{"text":"Excellent food and drinks. The staff was beyond pleasant and accommodating.  My husband had a Pho Bowl and I had the lemongrass chicken."}
{"text":"Can't say much for the pho because I tend to avoid it around Charlotte since I always get disappointed time and time again. 

I got the hu tieu xao ap chao (extra crispy stir fried noodles) and it was the bomb dot com! I love the way they make their hu tieu xao because it ends up staying super crispy despite having sauce all over. I just wished they gave me more noodles to balance all the protein I got. Service was on the slower side, but then again, I never expect that much from Viet restaurants anyway. Def coming back for more."}
{"text":"I have been hearing good things about the pho and how great it is here, finally decided to try it and I was really impressed. The pho was very tasty, stock was well seasoned and the vegetables seemed fresh. I also got spring rolls but forgot to mention to make them veggie, they were gracious enough to exchange them, so that is good customer service. The spring rolls were crunchy, decent overall. Quiet, casual, family friendly vibe. Definitely recommend the pho and get the Large or you will regret it later."}
{"text":"The food here is good, I come here whenever I'm in town. My husband and I love the pho here so we order that along with friend spring rolls. The service is good & the place is clean. Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Apparently they changed owners, my wife and I have been eating here since they opened, I eat the same thing every Thursday , short ribs extra meat , today she did to go, waited 50 min, finally got it, it's burnt , and if this is $4.00 up charge for extra meat I would hate to see the regular order, after all the times we have been there I think this is our last , I wouldn't feed this to the dog , the char from the grill is terrible , anyway good luck and roll the dice, don't change what's working, not very good business ,"}
{"text":"Pho please! Saigon Bay has amazing pho and excellent service as well.  I went with a friend of mine who knows good Asian food and I was very happy I did.  I have never had Pho and he had some great recommendations on flavoring Pho to your specific taste.  We ordered the PH TÁI (Pho with beef round), GI CUN (fresh spring shrimp rolls), and COM ?C BIT (pork plate).  Pho tastes great by itself, but adding lime, hoisin sauce, and cilantro really amp the flavors.  In addition to the Pho, we also ordered the pork plate with a variety of ways to prepare pork, but the chargrilled pork chop was crazy good. The service was very friendly and helpful.  I will absolutely go back."}
{"text":"This Vietnamese restaurant might have the best service in any restaurant I have ever been to. My waiter was one of the most friendly, helpful, and kind waiters or people I've met. My dish, the noodle soup with shrimp/calamari was excellent and cleared my sinuses. The waiter even brought me a vegetable plate on request and gave informative recommendations. Later, he brought me a takeout container and a complementary new, fresh vegetable bag to go with. This restaurant is worth a visit."}
{"text":"I went to Boardwalk looking for a specific restaurant that was no longer there. I was drawn to Saigon Bay by the great reviews and lure of Vietnamese iced coffee. I ordered a lemongrass beef vermicelli noodle bowl and it was phenomenal. My sister ordered the spicy beef soup and she loved it as well. The food came out quickly. There were a lot of ethnic patrons (which I find important in ethnic restaurants). The Vietnamese iced coffee (espresso over condensed milk) was a perfect pick me up before a night enjoying the sights. Me and my sister both ate for less than $30. Will definitely add to me \"Go To\" list for the Queen City."}
{"text":"Pho Dac Biet! Yum!  $9 for a regular bowl and the portions were big!  They didn't skim out on the meats... And it was a perfect size bowl for this hungry girl!   The service was very good. The ladies were very nice and polite ... And accommodating. I definitely recommending this place!  I have to come back and try their other items on the menu. #yum #pho #tasty #vietnamesecuisine"}
{"text":"I live in Raleigh and have already been here 3 times since it opened in October.  The food is super authentic, if you are looking for Americanized Viet food, you may want to ask your waiter for recommendations.

I highly recommend the baby clams with rice crackers (as a shareable appetizer).

of course the Pho is also amazing, lots of condiments and huge portions with great flavors"}
{"text":"Excellent pho. And very large, if you ask for large. Quite a deal. Boba tea is good too."}
{"text":"Had a good time. The waitress was nice and helpful. Had some decent pho, bam mi, and rice amongst friends. Definitely will come back for some hot pots on a special occasion."}
{"text":"This place didn't even deserve the one star.  We've given this place one too many chances.  Every time we come here it's fucked up.  Sometimes it's the servers, sometimes it's back of the house.  Yes we get it but I decided never to come back and waste my time and energy supporting restaurants that continuously fail."}
{"text":"Great food, good prices.

Pork eggrolls were a little oily but they are deep fried, si it is expected.

The Pho \"regular\" is gigantic, But so good that it dissapeared. Maybe will be good enough to share.

Went for the basil curry chicken. Taste is there, could use more spice, good that the spicy hot sauce at the table is my favorite. we have something similar in Mexico.

Overall $35 for 2 people is a good value for your money. Will def come back."}
{"text":"I don't live in the Charlotte area. I drove down from Winston-Salem and wanted some food after an IKEA trip on a Saturday around 12:45PM. I was seated quickly and the restaurant was about half full. It continued to fill up as a sat to almost totally full as I was eating. 

I tried to order the coconut water but they were out. I was going to get an order of spring rolls with shrimp and pork and another one with grilled pork after reading reviews that the grilled pork was very good. The waitress said its not on the menu but she could make shrimp with grilled pork rolls for me so I got that. It was the same price as just one order of rolls. They were pretty good, I was expecting the grilled pork to be sweet but it wasn't really. They give you plenty of sauce and it's nice and thick. 

For my entree, I got a regular combo pho and I told them to leave off the cilantro and no mistakes! I didn't get a picture but the basil and bean sprouts were super fresh. I'm sure it's not always the case but they looked excellent. The beef was thin sliced and the broth was really flavorful. I think this is my favorite pho place so far in North Carolina. ( I grew up in Denver where there is an abundance of great pho restaurants.) I would definitely not hesitate to stop by again. The service was also lightning fast. I got my food so quickly after I ordered."}
{"text":"The best fried calamari, and great Pho too.   The cocktails are even very good and unique.   Sweet and friendly servers and great service.    Love this little place!"}
{"text":"It took me too long to find this place. Too long. I'm kinda mad at myself too because of the proximity to Sams Club and how often I am in the area. 

It was time to try a new place and I had this place on my radar. I really want o give this place 5 stars but since living in here in the Queen City my experiences with pho places have been pretty Inconsistent. Good sometimes, great others and wtf at others. So I'm going to give it a few more visits before I give up the 5. But... They are worthy. So worthy.

The first time I came, I was pleasantly surprised about the amount of Asian people on site. I mean it was a sign of good things to come.

Service is always good. Mostly great. They don't harp over you but check in often enough.

And they offer different size bowls for pho. Kid, regular and large. Love this.
The bun Bo hue knocks my freaking socks off. It's authentic and flavorful, only missing the actual piece of pork hock that I really enjoy in mine. But what they lack in pork hock, they make up for with plenty of meat. So filling and not just with noodles.

The pho broth is good too. Legit stuff. And again... They feed you with protein not just a big bowl of rice noodles. 

The papaya salad here is good too. Plenty of beef jerky. They decorated the plate with sriracha which I could have done without but good.

The grilled pork rolls here are my favorite. So fresh and delicious. 

This is definitely my favorite place in Charlotte for pho. Don't be like me and wait a year and a half to try this place."}
{"text":"One of the best Pho place in Charlotte! This place is closer to where I live so it's more convenient for me to go to this place. The staff is very friendly and they know you! I'm a regular so they all pretty much know what I order. That's what I like about this place. :)"}
