{"text":"Despite the reviews, I went with two friends for dinner. I hadn't been to Marcelita's in many years, and it's sad to say how bad it was. It was empty on a Friday night, which should have warned us even more. The chips and salsa, as others have said, were stale (chips) and bland and watery (salsa).
I ordered the steak and chicken fajitas. They arrived not even close to sizzling. The steak was luke-warm and so gristly that I only ate half. The shrimp was mediocre (at least it was mostly warm). The rice side was cold too... in fact the best part of my dinner was the wraps - at least they were warm.
My friend had the veggie fajita salad. She was served a dinner salad with a side of wilted veggies - with the bonus of a piece of hair in them.
The other friend had a burrito and could only say it was edible.
It's sad to see this place having gone so far downhill, but all I can say is none of us will ever go there again. Yuck."}
{"text":"While others reviews haven't been glowing, i have never had a bad meal or poor service in the 25 + years i have been dining in and carrying out.  The bar has a friendly 'home town' kind of atmosphere.  The bartenders are great and remember your name even when you are a frequent visitor.  The food is delicious, fast and PIPING hot when it gets to the table.  Everyone has a different approach to mexican food, this one is perfect for me and my family.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Marcelita's on a whim.  And I have to say we were not a bit disapointed.  The staff was friendly.  The atomspher was inviting.  We ate in the main dinning area and our waitress Ashley was friendly and helpful.  She even brought us samples of the different salsa's they have.  I had the fish taco. (Fish Taco - Straight from San Diego! A fried filet of white fish, with shredded cabbage, pico de gallo and yogurt-ranch sauce in a flour tortilla.)  Now, I've never had one before, but I have to say it was delicious!  My wife had the chicken fajita and really enjoyed the flavor.  (Marinated and grilled, then sliced and served sizzling hot with rajas, pico de gallo (mild or spicy), cheese, wheat tortillas, plus rice and beans. Sour cream upon request. Half beef, half chicken available on \"Mr. Marcelitas\" portion.) And something that we have to recommend...now its not very mexican...but WOW was it good.  You must try the Homemade Ho-Ho cake desert.  Its incredible!  Oh and one more thing.  If you like margaritas.  You have to try the Cuervo Blue Margarita.  My wife is a margarita \"snob\" and she just LOVED it!  We really don't understand why anyone would not enjoy a night out at Marcelita's.  We're going to come back and try the bar side next. They have a different menu for that side of the resturant."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in years. Decided to come tonight, Saturday night, Sweetest Day, 7:30pm. The place was virtually deserted. No one in the bar, took about 10 minutes for a hostess to come up and tell us we could seat ourselves. The chips were gross. The salsa tasted like it came out of a jar.  I got a chicken quesadilla and it was gross. My friend got shrimp tacos which were average and she said the beans tasted sour and were gross. The bathroom...nasty. Smelled horrible, very dirty and looked like it hasn't been cleaned in ages. We should have left during our 10 minute wait to seat ourselves."}
{"text":"Marcelita's is a good, albeit not great, Mexican restaurant on 91 right on the border of Hudson & Twinsburg. I was there on a Thursday night at around 6 and the parking lot was full, which gives you an idea of how popular the place is. There was no wait though. Our waitress was very friendly and did a great job. No complaints on service. They give you chips and salsa when you get settled, just like most Mexican restaurants. The salsa was pretty good. We also ordered the guacamole for an appetizer. It came mixed with diced tomatoes. It was really good I thought. For my entree, I got the wet beef burrito (they could've chose a better name I think). I got it with both beans and rice. The burrito was huge! Inside it was just shredded beef but it was covered by lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, some sort of sauce, and sour cream. It was definitely good, but nothing special. The beans and rice were good also. Overall, Marcelita's is a good Mexican restaurant, but I've never understood it's huge appeal across the area. I guess it's the total lack of Mexican food in Greater Cleveland. It's worth a visit though."}
{"text":"Overrated Mexican restaurant loved by Hudsonites. I've never been overly impressed by food, it's always just kinda blah. Its always packed, and people love it, but it just doesnt do it for me. I'd much rather go to El Campesino."}
{"text":"I hate to do it, however 2 stars from me. Their salsa has a Marinara base to it. Awful! The food is nowhere close to being authentic. Quality since the 1990's is way down. Chipotle has much better salsa options.  Ouch."}
{"text":"Uck. Save your money. My husband and I stopped into the bar area for appetizers and drinks. The frozen margaritas are over priced. We weren't offerd a menu at all during our time there so we just had drinks.  The free salsa and chips were stale and old. Hint...salsa should be served cold. The air conditioning was cranked so high we were shivering. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food and Marcelita's used to be my local favorite. About ten years ago they started to go downhill and I abandoned them for other places. I stopped in last year and it seemed like they had improved under the new owners so I took some friends there last weekend to see if they had reestablished their dominance.

First, the Margaritas were very weak. When paying $8.00-$9.00 for a 20 oz drink one would think they would at least taste the tequila. Nope. Not these (and I was not the only person in my group of 11 to voice that opinion).

Now for the food. I ordered the shredded beef, 3 enchilada dinner with mole sauce on two of them and suiza sauce on the third. Unfortunately, they were all sent out with mole sauce so, while the mole sauce was delicious, I can't report on the suiza. The beef was also fantastic. It DID NOT have that out-of-a-can taste and appearance that drove me away ten years ago. The beans were, well, beans and the side of rice was uneventful.

Overall, I am giving Marcelita's 3 stars. If I only judged them on the enchiladas with mole sauce it would be five, but for the prices they now charge (one of the most expensive Mexican restaurants in the Akron area) the beans, rice and drinks should also knock it out of the park. And they shouldn't make mistakes on the orders (one other person said they got two things wrong on their order). My meal, with gratuity, was $30.00. I can get food just as good for half to two-thirds at other places in this area.

There used to be a long wait to get seated at Marcelita's. Not any more. On a Saturday evening I noticed several unoccupied tables. Don't know what it's like during the week at happy hour, but it looks like Marcelita's still has a bit of a hill to climb."}
{"text":"I used to eat here often until I tried the El Campesino group in Twinsburg and Streetsboro.  I WILL NOT return to Marcelita's.  Indifferent service, especially in the bar and a rather plain menu are just a few of my reasons."}
{"text":"We go about once a month.  I have to agree with the previous yelper - I crave the wet burritos.  I get either the shredded beef, shredded pork, or veggie.  And always with the green sauce.  The chips and salsa are not even close to being the best in our area, but they are OK.  One pet peeve of mine is that I have been going with children for 12 years, and the kids meal is supposed to come with ice cream and cinnamon chips.  They almost NEVER bring it out unless you ask for it.  Many times we have forgotten to ask, or had carry-out only to get home and find that it was not included.  One would think that by now I would remember to remind the servers (not that it is my job to remind them).  The only thing that I can think of is maybe they are instructed not to ask you if you want the ice cream that you have already paid for.  Also, the price is steep."}
{"text":"The service was good, although a bit slow.  The food had no flavor and seemed as if it had been reheated from dinner the night before.  I left wondering if I'd be ill."}
{"text":"Still the best local Mexican restaurant gets 5 stars food, 3.5 stars price, 5 for service, 5 for location in very nice area (Hudson, OH), I recommend!"}
{"text":"Ok, full disclosure. I've been going to this place most of my adult life. However, I'm going to be as objective as possible for purposes of this review. 

Starting off with the good: Chips and salsa. The free red salsa is ok, the hot red is a little better and the tomatillo is tasty. I'd sit in the bar area so you can refill chips as I've had a lack of service a few times in the dining area.

As for the so-so: Food. The sauces are pretty good, and everything comes together all right, but the food definitely isn't Mexican gourmet. Inf fact, in some instances I would prefer a taco truck burrito to the one I get here.

That leads to the bad: The quantity and the quality. The quantity is smaller that what you would get at any other Mexican joint. So fill up on chips and salsa. Next, I'm a little bit dubious on the quality of ingredients that are used. The last time I got a burrito, I got a shriveled jalapeno next to it. If that little jalapeno was indicative of the freshness of the rest of the meal... yikes.

So summing up, chips and salsa good. Service is ok. Food is so-so (tastes good, less filling). 

I'd definitely go back, but that may just be for nostalgia purposes rather that actual good food."}
{"text":"Never. Again. Dirty dishes. Ants crawling on us more than once. Seriously. If that's authentic ambience, I'll pass. Broken toilets. Crappy food. I honestly want a shower after being there. We used to enjoy Marcelita's. Looked forward to going there. But something has fallen off in a big way. We won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is ok. The food is good for being in the Midwest. For Mexican food, I think its expensive.$9 for three rolled tacos is ridiculously expensive considering it doesn't even come with rice and beans. It's fried tortillas with a pinch of shredded beef!
The rice is not true Spanish rice, the Margaritas are just ok and the inside of the restaurant looks run down. I would say the food is more authentic than other places here in Ohio but its not the best."}
{"text":"20 years ago, very good. 10 years ago , so-so. Today, overpriced, bland  \"Mexican \" food, this place has gone downhill bigtime. We used to go monthly , now at most yearly."}
{"text":"My husband grew up with Marcelita's and we come here all the time for happy hour on Thursdays to get margaritas, their homemade chips, and inexpensive tacos.  I used to get their fajitas with steak all the time, but unfortunately, the prices under the new owners have since gone up significantly."}
{"text":"This place is always packed and I just don't get it. After waiting almost an hour to be seated, it was almost another hour to get our food that was HORRIBLE even after asking to be served the best thing they got. Granted, we're from out west and used to good Mexican food, but the small plop of food they put on your plate is poor at best. Don't even bother to buy their over priced super sweet margaritas clearly from a mix. Decent Mexican food is not that hard to make. Again I say, I just don't get it."}
{"text":"Its about par for mexican food in the area. Coming from California my expectarions may be set too high but this wasn't that good. Disappointed that they didnt havr horchada"}
{"text":"I may be biased, coming from California having real authentic Mexican food, but this doesn't even come close.   I've had better salsa out of a jar.  Rice was dry, it looked like rice a roni.  To sum it all up, we won't be back"}
{"text":"Marcelitas sounds like it might be a good Mexican restaurant. Unfortunately the name is the best part of the restaurant.  Really awful food.  We ordered the fish taco which was a plank of clearly frozen fish on a tortilla with some flavorless sauce.  Completely inedible.  On the positive side, my fajitas were ok, but not worth going back for.  Normally, the chips and salsa are a good indicator of the quality of the food at a Mexican joint, and this is no exception here.  Chips are definitely straight from a bag and the salsa from a jar.  Our favorite place, Don Tequila in University Heights, makes homemade chips and salsa.  And now I really appreciate the difference!  Don't waste your time going here."}
{"text":"Based on an early July experience this place gets full marks for friendliness and attentive service but near-nada for food.  Wife and I spend a good part of our winters in western MX (not at a turista place) and know our way around south of the border eats and seasonings .  There's better \"street food\" in just about any Mexican town than what's served here.  Marcelina's menu is more toned-down Cal-Tex than Mex.  Six of us dined there and the food was invariably lacking in taste --from the commercial chips (totopos) and thin salsa through the main courses and sides.  This is inoffensive, filling food but worth a return visit... certainly not."}
{"text":"The food at Marcelita's is very good Mexican food. Their guacamole (while expensive) is THE best guacamole I've ever had. I recommend the pork \"wet\" burrito. I am craving the guac right now just from thinking about it!"}
{"text":"I grew up in neighboring Twinsburg and this was the place my family used to always go to for Mexican.  We loved it, and my sibling and I were always excited to come here.  But since moving away from home, I've been back only a handful of times, and I have to say that this place isn't as good as I remember it.  Maybe it went downhill, or maybe my taste buds or dining experience has matured, I don't know.  The original owners (one of whom was an actual Mexican and purportedly brought her recipes over from the motherland) have retired, so that may have something to do with it, too.

The chips and salsa are outstanding.  I ask my mother to get me a bag of chips and a container of salsa to bring home with me every time I visit -- they're that good.  The 'ritas aren't bad, but they're more like an alcoholic lemonade than a real margarita.  And while the food tastes all right, the last couple of times I've been there it's had a distinctly frozen-and-reheated feel and appearance.  Some of my dishes have even arrived at my table lukewarm.

But it's the only decent Mexican you're going to find in the area (and most of the locals don't really know any better), which is why it's so popular.  If you go there on a weekend evening during peak hours, expect to wait upwards of 30 minutes for a table.  I've never personally had an issue with poor service in the 25 years I've been patronizing this place, but I'm sure it happens from time to time, so take those reviews with a grain of salt.

I give it four stars for the chips/salsa and the nostalgia.  I do still look forward to coming here whenever I'm in town, but it's no longer the benchmark against which I judge other Mexican places."}
{"text":"Eat In Lunch Review 

Quick service, lots of options, and soup with your lunch entree for $7 - you had me at the chips! 

This restaurant opened the week of my birthday... many moons ago... in what now is the first area you walk into the bar. It was a strip club before that... my school bus would turn around in the parking lot and we would giggle at the names of the \"performers\"... needless to say it has changed some over the years! 

On a Saturday afternoon at 1 pm we had no trouble getting a table and being served quickly. 

Our beverages never got to half empty, and there was no charge for the epic Inferno Sauce... it used to be $1 extra back in the day :-)! 

We both started with a cup of Tortilla soup with a nice gentle heat and good bean flavor. 

Hubby had the lunch portion of Chicken Quesadilla. He is not a re-fried bean person, but loved these. The rice had peas, carrot and onions and he finished that quickly as well. The chicken was moist and the cheese well melted. The tortilla had a nice crunch but was still soft on the mouth. 

I opted for the naked beef burrito since I don't like the spice in any Spanish Rice... and plain rice wasn't an option (one star lost). 

I like my burrito with plenty of lettuce, tomato, and sour cream... the other review didn't \"get\" the fact that huge burritos at other places are stuffed with rice and beans? His loss... the shredded beef was moist and just spicy enough for me :-)! 

With a slice of Ho Ho Cake to go our total was $21 and we left full, mouth's burning and with a HUGE dessert for dinner."}
{"text":"Wow! Has this place gone down the tubes, or was I just a kid that didn't 'know no better?'

Our kids raved about the place because their class visited on a field trip.  We return and they had none of the basic items from the field trip in stock.  Heck, should have ordered the kids a burger instead.

The food was average to below average, the service slow and overworked but didn't let on to it, and the bill was high for what was paid.

Parking was plentiful (should have been a sign), and the place seemed clean in general.  

I don't know if they need a new menu or a kitchen staff that can actually cook, but there's something substantive missing from this attempt at a Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Went up to Marcelita's to meet some friends for some grub a few nights back. I'd heard a few good things, and these friends (who chose the venue) are foodies, so I had high hopes. 

How'd the meal go? Well, it took 45 minutes to get a table, then 30 minutes to convince a waitress to take our order, then waited way too long for the food, even waited too long for the card to swipe at paying time. Atmosphere was plain and pointless. 

For 13 bucks, I got a burrito of the size and quality of a chili cheese burrito from America's most disgusting pseudo-Mexican purveyors, Toxic Hell. It also came with beans and rice. Still, 13 bucks could buy a shit-ton of chili cheese burritos, and without the drive to Hudson. A couple folks at our table got fajitas, and they looked good but not $17 worth of good. 

Just like everything in Hudson (the restaurants, the houses, the stores), Marcelita's is incredibly overpriced and exceptionally generic. The only way they can possibly stay open is to sell their boring food to equally boring suburbanites. At least the folks we ate with kept good company! 

UPDATE: Well, in confirming with multiple other members of our party, absolutely everyone who ate there is now sick with food poisoning. Considering the pain I've been in for the last 18 hours, I would give this dump a negative star rating if I could. I'm thinking maybe a -8 stars, one for each time I've puked."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Mexican food. Pleasant staff. Friendly owners. Great kids menu. Good live entertainment."}
{"text":"So I've read all of the reviews listed here.  Most of them less than flattering.  I also see how they have been voted Mexican Restaurant of the year.  I met a friend (who raves about the place) for lunch to experience for myself.  The ambiance is very basic, uninspiring.  The menu is somewhat limited -- no Tamales that I could find.  The chips were OK.  The salsa was OK.  The tomatillo salsa reminded me of something I got out of a jar, only less flavorful.  We ordered the cheese nachos.  Nice serving size, but the chips were burned.  Their lunch specials seem to be a good value.  If you order over $6 you get free soup.  I sampled the gazpacho.  Very poor.  Tasted like watered down salsa.  Bland.  I had the chicken enchilada with mole sauce.  Well prepared and tasty.  We also had the wet burrito.  Again, very tasty.  Servings were not generous.  I would say appropriate for lunch.  Service was a bit slow.  I did not experience the bar, which I hear is very nice.  Overall, I've had better Mexican in the area."}
{"text":"Second Round:
Sit in same spot.  Same bartender.  good vibes!  
\"Let me get you some chips and salsa\"  Hell  yes... \"would you like some hot sauce?\" looks like someone learned something.  O the same stale chips... ok still good mood.  Conways draft mmmmm...  half a bowl of stale chips later  \"would you like something to eat?\"  Well since I got no menu, you guys serve food?  ok I'll wing it.  2 chicken tacos soft shell with rice and beans.  Reasonable request.  The tacos ok size, chicken stewed but ok.  Lettuce dry and old.  Taco  5.5 out of 10.  Beans very good.  Rice still not great.  Over all the meal was ok.  Service ok.

Bill comes.  I feel like I have been robbed.  If you charge over 5 bucks a taco, at least have the decency of making the tortilla yourself.  I have been twice burned here.  Maybe I am Drelping a bit, but come on!"}
{"text":"Disgusting filthy bar area. We sat at the bar for dinner and couldn't believe all the filth and years of dirt behind the bar!! Food was a greasy sloppy mess."}
{"text":"My first visit here, and my last. I'm sorry to say...this restaurant doesn't have a clue about Mexican. Fajitas had no spice, even though we ordered mild spice. Salsa...can't even describe it...tasted weird...can't even compare it to anything. Service was ok. And the kicker was the pizza delivery to the back door. You know the food is bad when the employees order in!!!"}
{"text":"A friend and I met at Marcelita's last night for dinner 11/5/2014. The service was very good.  It was a little slow but our server had several tables and was doing a good job. 

We had a pitcher of Margaritas that I would rate as fair to good, nothing special. 

The salsas (both regular and inferno) had odd/off flavors. The chips were no typically yellow and I would except of corn tortilla chips, but they were wheat colored and lacked a crunchy corn flavor. They were saltier than expected. 

In ordered two chicken enchiladas with the tomatillo sauce (suisa).  Unlike the menu picture, the sauce was brown, not green. The cheese was gummy.  The rice was unlike any other Mexican rice that I ever had, it seemed like the only flavor was parsley. Very bland. The beans could have come right out of a can. 

I would not go back."}
{"text":"I grew up in the Stow/Hudson area and Marcelita's has always been a family favorite. Each time we are back in town, it's a \"must-do\" on our list. The restaurant did change owners a few years back, but the new owners kept pretty much the exact same menu and recipes, which I love. They even added a couple improvements like offering black beans as an alternative to refried beans. 

I will agree that the service can be hit or miss though. Last time we were there, we specifically requested our son's food come out ASAP and I actually think the waitress just forgot his order completely because we had to ask where it was when the rest of the table's food came out. (In her defense, it was a crazy busy night and we were an oh-so-fun party of ten with the baby.)

I am sorry that others on here have not had such good experiences. That makes me sad."}
{"text":"Average food, average service.  Hubby and I have been eating here for years, but have noticed lately that quality has slipped and value has taken a nose dive as prices have escalated.  $10 bucks for a wet veggie burrito with no sides--made with less than a dollar's worth of ingredients...and watch out if you use a coupon from the paper--so many conditions and exclusions.  Tonight's dinner will be our last."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican food when I got home to Hudson! They give you a basket of chips with salsa that is amazing! The margarita's are huge and very strong! The menu includes a wide variety of Mexican food!"}
{"text":"i love this place. i used to live in hudson and it's a staple- a great place to go w/ friends or fam. the food is really good- it's hard to call it mexican (esp. since i live in san diego now and have enjoyed gems such as trujillos) but it's good AMERICAN mexican. they also have a veggie wrap that makes me happy :-)"}
