{"text":"Horrible service!!!!!  When they make a mistake, they just keep blaming my wife and fighting, instead of fixing it. Also had a hair in my wife's last take out order."}
{"text":"I went here based on the reviews! I was actually pretty satisfied! I have lived on the northwest side of town for over 5 years and always got the advertisements and coupons but never went. I'm glad I went finally because I wanted Chinese but not so much \"panda\" ... Lol. The only downside is that the service is not great at all. They were pretty stale and unwelcoming when I ordered. A lil disappointed, a lil customer service 101 could help them bump to atleast 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Always delivers a fresh, quality product. I find myself craving the Black Pepper Chicken quite frequently.  Friendly staff and quick service. Love, love, love this place."}
{"text":"I just came from here. I have ordered from this place for 4 years and until now have never had an issue. Today I bought two Thai teas with boba and I got into the car and tasted the boba it tasted like a ROTTEN , bleached boba. It was not even sweet. I told them they need to taste their boba and they need to change the batch because it is ROTTEN they did not believe me nor did they want to to try their own batch of boba. They tried to reserve me another two drinks with that same batch of boba so I asked for a refund they just gave me a receipt saying VOIDED transaction. Let's just say if this transaction does not void we will have even more problems. I just want them to NOT serve it to anyone else. Serving bleach and ROTTEN tasting boba is like serving poison to your customers! NEVER again will I go here to this location only for the simple fact that they would not believe the customer."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. They have excellent Chinese food for a fair price (a rice bowl for instance only $5). They also have great lunch deals. Go in and grab a quick bite, or get it as take out. The employees are very nice every time we go here and never have any issues."}
{"text":"First of all if I could give less than one star I would . Not that the food was that bad, although I've tasted better. The one Star is for the unbelievably rude person working there. I went there on Tuesday 12/26 at approximately 3pm. I ordered my food and attempted to pay with my ATM card which has my picture on it. The person working there insisted on seeing an additional ID because he said I \"Didn't look the same!\"  I told him my other ID was in the car, he insisted I go and get it. When I brought it back he scrutinized both ID's for at least two minutes before he swiped my card!  I have used my ATM card constantly with no problems until that day!  The only difference is my hair is longer and there is grey in front. This man was rude and ignorant and I will never patronize that restaurant again! If anyone asks me about Chinese food I will tell them NOT to go there."}
{"text":"This place is soooo YUMMMY!! I always order my delivery and the come on time! :) And they always pack the togo boxes to the max! So I always have left overs everytime. And its so cheap here! Its hard to find quality food for good prices! Oh and their  boba is freakin delicious!!!! All in All this place is wonderful!!"}
{"text":"I love the food here. However, a few days ago my boyfriend and I arrived at 8:45 pm to grab a bite to eat. As we entered the place of business, the older lady behind the counter was visibly and verbally upset that we chose to dine in. She informed us that the business closes at 9:30. We said okay. So we tried to make things easy in here by going to the counter to place our order. She gave my boyfriend a very hard time as he tried to place the order. After 4 attempts to place the order we ended up walking out. So that's why I'm giving 2 stars today. I hope to continue eating here but the way we were treated a few nights ago was uncalled for."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is but to me everything that I've tried here is pretty bland and hit or miss. I've eaten here a handful of times and I've always been disappointed with the flavor.  I feel like they try to cut back on the sodium but the food comes out being very tasteless and boring.  Can't really comment on the service as I have only had take-out here.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Seriously, how is this place so highly rated?! Waited 40mins for weeknight delivery LITERALLY 3 lights east on the same street! Potstickers were bland & the dough was so thick, they never had a chance to be crisp, even if they arrived in a timely matter.  Chicken chow mein was a joke, hardly any chicken or veggies. Just a mass of overcooked mush. I threw it away & I swear, even the trash complained. I think ramen nuked at the 711 wouldve been better. No worries, I will be recommending this place in the future.....to my enemies"}
{"text":"When I came a ate lunch at China, the prices were reasonable, i paid $6.97 for orange chicken and it was a big portion. The employees were kind and quick with my order. As I sat down to wait for my look around the tables were clean, floor looked okay. The food was very good, i absolutely loved the orange chicken. I would go back, and would most likely recommend it to a friend. Overall, I was very satisfied with my experience, thank you China One."}
{"text":"Came on a busy Friday night.  They provided quick service and good food!  Couldn't ask for more when I was starving.  The staff was extremely pleasant and cleared out the line quickly."}
{"text":"I love the portions of the food! They bring your food out ridiculously fast and the ladies working here are so sweet! I'm so glad I live close by because this is my favorite Chinese place I've ever been too! Definitely worth the price , everyone should give it a shot !"}
{"text":"We love this place. Inexpensive. Huge portions (the husband and I usually share a main course and rice). Fresh, very tasty food. Great service. I've decided to up this from 4 to 5 stars. It's not the BEST or fanciest Chinese restaurant in the world ever, but it IS the best Chinese food for the price and convenience.  It beats the local competition hands down."}
{"text":"Would I say this was the best Chinese food I have ever had, no, but for the price and the location I continue to order from there time and time again.  If you are looking for a decently priced meal in the Centennial Hills area this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I ordered Pad thai noodles, it was flavorless and greasy with a mound of noodles and very little of the other ingredients."}
{"text":"Last night we ate at China One on Durango and Elkhorn. I had walnut honey chicken, it was pretty good but not much honey, tasted more like walnut mayonnaise chicken. Wife had com-pow chicken she said it was good. service was ok."}
{"text":"Greasy, nasty.  If a dish contains vegetables and tofu and then tons and tons of grease it should NOT be referred to as \"healthy.\"  Nor should it be called vegetarian if said vegetable dish contains chicken and beef broths and sauces.  Also QUIT A+WALKING THROUGH PEOPLES' yard!  There is a S.I.D.E.W.A.L.K. for a reason and you should learn to respect property.  Then after you trip over and knock over a fence in FRONT of the owner of the house you should probably...I don't know...say \"sorry\", maybe try to put it back or pick it up!  Not look up at them, then just continue to saunter of through the yard!  Also, if you get the order wrong and the vegetarian who ordered off of the VEGITARIAN MENU cannot eat the food because you messed up the order, then you should probably either deliver a new one and take the old back, or maybe...I don't know...give their money back since they just  couldn't eat it.  You probably should NOT try to charge ANOTHER plate and DELIVERY fee.  What is wrong with you, seriously?!"}
{"text":"This place is our \"go-to\" take out place. It's right by our house and the delivery is fairly quick. They don't speak the best English, but with a little patience the communication is not too difficult. We order the chicken lettuce wraps, crab Rangoon, wonton soup, egg drop soup, chicken chow mien and the beef with broccoli. We haven't ever had a poor meal there, I am unsure what all the bad reviews are for, this place is a hole in the wall, not gourmet Asian cuisine. Service, food, and delivery speed are acceptable"}
{"text":"The food was very tasty. The Shrimp Fried Rice was really good, nice size shrimp. The Shrimp Chow Mein was also really good, again nice size shrimp. The Broccoli Beef was SUPER! Seasoned really well, no salt needed, at all. The egg rolls were nice and crispy. The ladies that work there were friendly. The parking lot is really hard to get out of, so I would suggest going there before ir after rush hours. You can smell the garlic from across the parking lot (that's kinda what got me in there). I would recommend going before or after rush hour, because it's really hard to get out of the parking lot. My family and I will be going back!"}
{"text":"The cashier taking the  order was rude, did not  great  us at all, neither  thank us at the  end, order to dine out.  While ordering  had to repeat myself in different  occasions.  I spend  like fifty dollars, left  five dollars  tip, ordered  couple of Thai  tea drinks, which  the same  lady comes back and throws them at us including  the  straws.  All the cooks and other employees  kept  staring like if we were some  criminals.  Made us feel  very  uncomfortable, I was about to  cancel  my order when finally another  lady/employee  finally  gave  us our order without  acknowledging  us either.  I noticed  three other  customers  coming  in, and the same cashier  acts very nice, polite to this customers.  A complete  quality  of  customer service  to them.  Don't  we all deserve  the same  type  of  customer  service?  I  honestly  don't  want  to  mention  races, ethnicities.  As for me  it would  be  the last  time  going  to  that restaurant.  To the  owner  please teach your employees customer  service, and ethics classes.  Food  it's  good."}
{"text":"For a small hole in the wall place these guys deliver \"on taste\"...I used to pick up food from here after finding it by accident when I worked in the area. The food is better than \"Panda Express\" hands down...because everything is made to order and is fresh...( it hasnt been sitting around under a hot lamp and looks all dried up)...I would go more often if I lived closer. So if youre in the area...go there. Happy eating.."}
{"text":"I order from here alot. The food is great and comes in pretty big portions. The meat comes in big strips so you really get alot of it. You can customize the order as well and ask for extra cashews or chiles or whatever in various dishes.   The service and delivery is pretty fast too. They also send alot of coupons out and they're actually useful, not just $1 off or whatever.   This is a great place to get fast Chinese food."}
{"text":"My wife and I have visited several times - on one occasion with our grandson. We loved the food, the ambiance of the restaurant is much better than the previous restaurants in the space. We have enjoyed everything we've ordered from the menu. We have visited other Chinese restaurants in this area, but China One is, in our opinion, the best in quality of food and service. And the price is reasonable. This restaurant deserves to be better known on the Route 8 corridor in the North Hills. Try it - I think you'll agree."}
{"text":"So awesome!  Tried other places, but this is the best for delivery and taste. I'm addicted to the honey walnut shrimp !"}
{"text":"For the lunch special I would go if your in a rush, the food came out hot and fast and was $6.25 for a decent amount that should fill u up.  I got general Taos it was good, crunchy outside...not super soft like in malls. My kids got chicken and broccoli which was on par with most take outs.  This isn't a 5 star restaurant so don't expect it to be, but it is an option compared to all the McDonald's and pollo loco's and equivalent fast food.  -Alex"}
{"text":"Very good service, everyone was pleasant and nice. Food was hot, tasty, fresh and flavorful. Hong Kong noodles with garlic sauce and General Tso's chicken were great. Didn't care for hot & sour soup, only because it had a mixture of seafood items, we like ours without. Good variety of items to choose from."}
{"text":"I usually judge a food place by my overall experience as opposed to focusing only on the quality of the food and service. That experience starts from the moment I get out of my car. For starters, the moment I opened my car door before stepping out, I was met with a \"hey big man (I'm a big man), you help me out with some change for the bus?\"  Mind you, I parked right in front of the place so this is definitely a demerit against them as they have every right and responsibility as a business to prevent this sort of thing from happening. It's not like I have a phobia of homeless folks, but there's nothing like having a filthy greasy booze-breathed hobo greet me at my car on my way into a restaurant  to whet the appetite.  Once I give the guy some change, I walk in to this typical strip mall Chinese take-out style eatery and am immediately greeted with \"for here or to-go?\" From across the room. When I'm ordering, I ask if they have unsweetened Iced tea. She doesn't know, she asks the girl right next to her who ignores her. We stand there for 20 seconds of silence before a man walks out and lists off the iced teas. I ask, \"Are they all sweetened?\" He lists them all off again. He didn't understand the question. I get it, this is America and there will be times where you run across a foreigner and cannot understand their language, I'm in their place, so I nod and ask for water. The first bottled water I receive had been previously opened. I tell them and they look at me like I'm crazy before getting me a new bottle.   When the food arrives, the server places the largest plate of chicken katsu I've ever seen on the table in front of me. I would have been extremely impressed by this had I not ordered the beef with broccoli. I tell the server and I get the same look like I'm lying or something. Finally the beef with broccoli arrives on a large plate accompanied by a second large plate covered in steamed rice. Looks good! It was NOT!   First of all, I was given a large spoon to eat my beef with broccoli. At this point, I don't feel like getting another look, so I pretend that I am accustomed to eating broccoli with a spoon and I smile and say thank you. Then I take the first bite. DISGUSTING!  It tasted like pounded beef fat covered in pure oyster sauce dipped in salt. The broccoli was a bit overcooked and every so often while hovering over my plate to prevent lap spillage, I get a whiff of some foul stank feet. No, it was not me, it was the plate. I have worked in enough short order kitchens to recognize that scent. It's filthy dish water. I was so appalled that I bothered to write this review. I would not have normally bothered to write a review of a strip mall place, but it was so gnarly that I want to prevent anyone from going to China One."}
{"text":"I was always certain about Chinese food until I ordered from here. I am going to admit that I'm a picky eater, I don't like steamed chicken, just ew. And in the menu section is doesn't specify that the chicken is steamed. Once I order I was experience GRILLED chicken and ended up with a 10$ trash waste. I thought the wonton soup was delicious the first time I tried it, but the second time it was a bit too soggy. The breaded lemon chicken was ok. Tasted kinda like fish which my girlfriend didn't like because she hates seafood. The rice was way to dry for he liking as well; the vegetable rolls were just straight up disgusting. Overall it was ok. But not the best."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great Kung Pao. Good heat and good flavor. Best chinese in the valley."}
{"text":"I like to have china one food sometimes. It's more or less closer to real Chinese food than lets say panda. This location is nicer for the dine it than the other location i used to go. Anyway i like it."}
{"text":"This is my go to place when I want some Chinese! It is my favorite Chinese place ever!! Employees are very friendly, and the food is cooked fresh! Never left out in containers like Panda Express. Love it! :)"}
{"text":"The weirdest chinese food I've ever had! I ordered Mongolian beef and beef chow mein. The beef did not look like beef. It was just a funny piece of meat all around. Doesn't taste good. The chow mein noodles tasted and felt funny... It was all elastic like.   This was our first visit. I won't be ordering here again. I want to try their general chicken but I'm afraid it'll disappoint.  I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Slow delivery. Last 2 times it's taken well over an hour for delivery. If your hungry, order somewhere else."}
{"text":"The food is always good and fresh.  This is our go-to Chinese food restaurant.  We like the chicken in hot garlic sauce and the orange chicken."}
{"text":"Good food!! We've only ever ordered delivery it's always on time. Only reason it didn't get five stars is they didn't specify on what kind of fried rice it came with. I do not eat pork and when we ordered fried rice it turned out to be a blend of pork chicken and shrimp. It was good besides the fact I had to pick out all the little pork pieces"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious.  I had the Singapore noodle with pork and the other dishes at our table were Pepper Steak and Sweet & Sour Shrimp. The meat was good quality, not too fatty or grisly. The wait staff was gracious and friendly. I would recommend eating here and we'll be back"}
{"text":"(Zero Stars) Just left a dinner. Got about 30% into my meal and discovered a hair in my fried rice. (considered whether it could have been mine but I pulled it out of a piece of egg)  The waiter says he'll talk to the manager about it. For the next 5minutes I sat while the staff awkwardly looked at the hair,  the back at the table laughing as if I planted the hair in my own food. I finally got over it and got up to pay,  the waiter days he's sorry,  and he hopes it doesn't happen again, BUT that'll be full price. HE HOPES IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN?  (Cause I'm definitely going to be in the mood for hair fried rice again soon)"}
{"text":"It's my first time ordering from the China One near my house.  I ordered delivery from them last night,  Mu Shu Chicken... Not my usual dish from Chinese restaurants,  but I was feeling adventurous. Rice-good, cookie-good, Mu Shu chicken-makes my entire body cringe and convulse! Big ass bug in my meal... Made it to my mouth! I crunched down on this wing thing and it was hard! Big beastly bug!!  Disgusted!!"}
{"text":"USED to love this place! Until me and my boyfriend went here for lunch today, and there was a cockroach crawling towards us on the booth . Did not even eat my meal absolutely disgusting. Told the waiter and all he did was give us $5 off the bill. Not to mention m boyfriend had to kill the bug himself."}
{"text":"We live too far for delivery, but we placed the order online expecting it to be ready when we got there to pick it up. When we got there, the order hadn't even been started yet! They claimed the \"system\" didn't alert them to the order at their location. Despite the fact we had an email confirmation of the location and 10 min expected time, we waited over 30 mins for our order. No apologies or effort to make up for THEIR mistake. Never again! China One just lost us as a multi-year loyal customer. Since when do you have to confirm a location AFTER placing an online order? Eat24 called us after leaving the restaurant, to ask which location we wanted. If it's that much of a problem, place a default confirmation in the ordering process ... Not AFTER. Who checks emails and texts while driving? EAT24 should learn from this, but China One should NEVER have asked for our money and accepted it BEFORE telling us the order hadn't been started ... And EAT24 was WRONG to tell us that we should have responded to their text and email that came to us 20 minutes after placing an ONLINE order."}
{"text":"authentic?  i think not. delicious?  i think yes, and the serving is generous. China One over Panda Express.  The End."}
{"text":"I was craving Chinese food and we spent about $45 on take out for the family. When we went in to order, there was a metal container sitting on one of the table filled with overcooked chicken parts that looked like it had been sitting out all day. We took our food home and it was okay. Soggy rice, extra thick sweet and sour sauce that textured like honey. Needless to say I ended up getting food poisoning and won't ever go to that location again. I did go to the one on Rampart and Lake Mead about a week ago(giving the chain a second chance) and it was way better than this location."}
{"text":"I wish I could give negative stars. Ordered to go and when I picked it up I asked for a couple extra soy sauce and a couple of empty containers since the kids like to have their own container. The girl behind the counter was so rude she said the extra soy sauce and containers were fifty cents each. I told her to keep them. The place also smelled bad. When I got home, the food tasted like it was prepared way before I ordered it. I wonder when the health district was there last."}
{"text":"This place was on point! The server was so nice and they even gave us free won tons for my son(he's 4 yrs old and a very picky eater). The food was so fresh and the lunch portions were huge! A great deal for the price. Very clean dining area and didn't have to wait long at all for our food. New favorite lunch spot for us!"}
{"text":"Very good for takeout Chinese food. They cook everything to order. I love the boba drinks there as well. The service was very friendly and the place is super clean."}
{"text":"Been looking for decent Chinese food place since moving here a year ago and still can't seem to find it.  The orange chicken was bad.  My kids love orange chicken.  Do you hear me?! They love orange chicken.  We got extra orange chicken because we knew that they would destroy it, yet it was left barely touched.  The beef and broccoli was just okay, kind of had an odd taste to it.  The only thing that I really enjoyed was the fried rice.  That stuff was amazing which is the reason for the 2 stars.  Unless I am craving some fried rice, I doubt that I will ever be back."}
{"text":"The singapore rice noodles are bombay as well as their selection of fresh veggies"}
{"text":"After reading the top reviews, I was excited since we recently moved to this area of Las Vegas.  The best I can say is that the woman on the phone and the delivery man were nice.  It is by far the worst Chinese food we have ever had.  We ordered the combo appetizer.  The only decent item on it was the Crab Rangoon.  We also ordered MooShu Pork and Pork Fried Rice.  We wound up tossing it after trying both.  What a waste of $30.00.  Buyer beware!  I will drive to the section of town where we used to live and take it home from our old Chinese restaurant from now on.  Taking no more chances!"}
{"text":"I don't know why people are trippin' because this was some of the best Chinese food I've had in Vegas. We ordered take out and got dinner B with wonton soup, house fried rice, general chicken, and shrimp chow mien. Yeah the food was kind of greasy but that's what Chinese food take out is about!  The wonton soup was huge and full on wontons, shrimp, pork, and vegetables. It was a little bland, but nothing a little soy sauce and chili garlic sauce couldn't fix!  The shrimp chow mein was also very tasty. I've had better shrimp in my life but it wasn't bad.  The general chicken is BOMB. Sweet and spicy.  The house fried rice was a little bit of everything and delicious.  The Thai tea was good. And all for $30!"}
{"text":"We went in there today a few minutes after 4 I asked the boy working the front counter if I could still get a lunch combo. He refused saying no,  I know for a fact he can do it. He couldnt even look at me saying this lie. He kept talking to the ground. We have been going to various location of China one for several years. They have always gone out of there way with great customer service. This China one lost a customer. I will never go back to this location. I rather go to Panda Express."}
{"text":"Excellent Food ! Outstanding Service.  On vacation from Texas we stumbled upon these victuals.  This Chinese grub is the best in the west."}
{"text":"I usually have a problem with neighborhood Chinese places. The food can be over sauced and greasy and sometimes poor quality. But China One is none of that. I love the fried tofu and veggie lunch special. It is less than $6 and comes with chow mein and fried rice. The veggies are fresh and clean and the tofu is good. The portion is huge. A lunch special is big enough to share with another person. The shrimp dishes are great. The shrimp doesn't have a fishy taste at all. The service is fast and the staff is friendly. My only complaint is that they serve everything on Styrofoam and then throw it away."}
{"text":"They put egg shells in my egg foo young ... I am never going back.. I thought maybe a small piece was a mistake but it was literally the whole egg I'm the guy who came at 9 :40 before you closed   Saturday on 9/ 24....if you wanted to close just close don't put eggshells in my meal..."}
{"text":"This place is our go to Chinese restaurant. Fast, low cost, and good. We bring about 14 people in when we go, and it's no problem.   Staff is nice."}
{"text":"So pissed off with these morons! Placed delivery order with them, they confirmed my address from my phone number that I called in on. Said it would be 45-60 min. (They are .5 mile away) An hour and a half later I called and asked the status of my order, they told me I never called and placed one. I told them I had and maybe it's due to barley speaking English and not fully comprehending what I was saying. They argued that I never called and they would take my order now after I have been waiting and starving. 2 things, learn the language of the country you live in to operate business well, and put the order in once received!! Won't be coming back to this dog frying dump."}
{"text":"This place has constantly gone down in quality, mainly customer service. I get coupons from this place almost monthly in my mail from this place and EVERY single time I want to use one it had been a hassle to say the least. I have been over charged or charged the wrong items. Tonight took the cake when one of the front desk women thought I didn't pay for my egg rolls with my coupon and attempted to take my egg rolls out out my box after just previously eating herself and licking her fingers!!!! This was after I literally watched my order sit on the counter for 15 mins while all 4 front desk front desk clerks chatted and shared personal interest on there phones. Last time I'll be going here."}
{"text":"Terrible! Do not order from them, this is the worst Chinese food experience I've had. Had my cousin over for takeout, there's six of us, order a couple of different items. Well it takes an hour and a half for the food to come. It's like warm. And my cousins order is missing. We call back up and they argue with us. Finally after twenty minutes on the phone they say the delivery gut is gonna be another twenty mintues. Well it takes thirty and they have the nerve to try and charge us again! So another ten mintues on the phone to get the second charge cancled. Food not the that great. Customer service absolutely terrible. Oh and to top off this entire thing, all of the six fortune cookies had the same fortune. Save yourself the trouble and don't eat here."}
{"text":"Love this place! They are always very fast, even during the dinner rush. I highly recommend the Singapore noodles! Yuummm! :)"}
{"text":"I very seldom if ever pass judgement on food service places because I know what it is to work in one.  But today was the absolute worst experience I could have ever had at a restaurant.    The female server that helped us was the rudest person ever.  I had a simple question on the menu, she rolled her eyes at me and has the nerve to say what.  So I repeated myself and asked what kind of sauce was on what I would order.  She said what it was and then I said ok I'll have that and she grabs the menu out of my hand coldly.  She then takes my friends order and our food was cooking there after.  Our server never delivers our food to us.  The gentlemen that worked the register brings us our food and we never get checked on until the very end.    All of the workers than gather at the front table nearest the register and a customer comes in to order his meal.  The female server gets up and takes his order and she again has the same reaction to the customer placing his order at the register.  All the while the customer sees them eating lunch and asks if it's ok to order.  She tells him it will be a few minutes.  The two cooks then get up to go in the back to start cooking.  One of the cooks washed his hand, the other absolutely DID NOT wash his hands at all.  Improperly handling the food and serving the customer who keeps their business going.    We get our check and no thank you or nothing.  They just continue eating and staring at us as if we are bothering them for coming into their restaurant.  Safe to say, we will never come to this restaurant.  But please guys beware.  Don't trust the service and the cooks because I sure will not."}
{"text":"we orderd on christmas day, 3 family dinners, all food was hot, yummy, and staff was freindly. I will come back to this place for sure. thank you china one!!!"}
{"text":"Most dissapointed in my wonton soup! I frequent two China Ones, by my job and home, I love the wonton soup. Being that we were in this area, we stopped in to get dinner on Sunday. They were busy but noone was eating inside, placed our order and was told 15 minute wait, not a problem at first. 10 minutes later a couple sat to eat, ordered and got served, but we were still waiting. 25 minutes later, we left, no complaint as thinking it would be worth the wait. Once I ate, I found they used battered shrimp in the soup. it grossed me out! too far to take it back, had to throw it away! In my many years of enjoying this awesome soup from many places or ChinaOnes, never had I seen or tasted battered shrimp in this soup.....so dissapointed, never going back to that one."}
{"text":"Love the Wonton soup.....bowls keep getting smaller though...they will add extra shrimp at a cost but heart already"}
{"text":"I gotta say from the outside it doesn't look so great, then you go inside and now you can't walk out. You just gotta order as you've already been sucked in, well at least that's how I felt.  I've seen this place a few times when I would go to the 99 cent store next door to stock up on some snacks; today I finally cured my curiosity and went in as I was craving some chow mein. At first I was expecting a Panda style Chinese fast food place where the items are already made and kept in a warmer. Not this place, everything is made fresh to order.  I was the only customer at that time and as soon as I got in I was greeted and was sat at a table. Basically this place is like a Chinese restaurant in a fast food form. You had your lunch specials but I was cruising through the menu and saw that they actually had a wide selection of food including chow fun.  I order the orange chicken lunch special, which comes with soup and wontons chips. The soup is egg flower with bits of corn which was mediocre but it's egg flower, nothing is special about egg flower soup. Immediately as the soup came out my entree came out.  I went for the orange chicken first and man was it hot! I wasn't thinking I guess, but the good thing was that it was crispy. I would say that their orange chicken is the best that I've had so far that's Chinese fast food. The fried rice was great as well, wasn't salty, wasn't plain, it was just right. Now the chow mein, it looked like linguine noodles and was just weirded out by that, and when I tasted it, it was definitely different, I've never had chow mein that tasted like that. It was okay-good, maybe because I was knocked back by what I was expecting the taste to be.  What shocked me now was the price, for the lunch combo and a soda, my total came out to $8.38! I didn't even get to finish the whole thing and immediately as I started working on it I was full. I've been eating the leftovers throughout the day and would've been the only meal I purchased had I not gone out to dinner with my girlfriend.  I recommend this place if you would like to have more money for gambling but still have food to eat throughout the day."}
{"text":"The portions are huge and the price is right. Delivery time is within an acceptable time frame too."}
{"text":"This was my go to for Chinese food. My friend recommended it and I was a regular. Until the worst happened.   Check this out: It was a Fri night and I was ready for my usual  veggie fried rice and egg roll. Order. Pick up. Take home hot food. Dig in and about two two spoon fulls in I feel something in my throat. I remember what my grandma says about fish bones in your throat. \" Get a piece of bread. \" (I usually don't keep a loaf of bread in the house but happened to have some in the freezer) I gagged and ate bread and finally some relief.  A small wire was caught in my throat. Like something you take off of a plastic bag. No damage But...  I'm done and so is this review."}
{"text":"Service was great food came out extremely fast. Which probably explains the lack of quality. I don't mind waiting a few extra mins if the food quality will come out better. Very greasy. Pretty disgusted just by looking at it and had no flavor. I also got a taro boba that when I took my first sip the boba balls were hard as a rock when I tried chewing. And the  taro smoothie was so sugary. Worst boba I've had in my life"}
{"text":"I've tried my fair share of local Chinese food and it always ends up a disappointment. China One, though not without such feelings draws me back time after time. Their food is pretty good(the only Chinese beef my hubby will eat) and you get big portions. They remember you and that makes a difference to me as a customer. Their service is friendly and cheerful. Beef Chow Fun and Shrimp Egg Fu Yung are my faves here.   I just wish I could find good pot stickers in this town. Why are they so hard to find?!"}
{"text":"I ordered the orange chicken and teriyaki chicken for delivery. Delivery was fast. Service was not bad. Chicken was weird. Super weird. I wouldn't feed it to my son. Only things edible were the veggies that came with the teriyaki, egg rolls, and steamed rice. Panda would have been a million times better. Miss my old Chinese place in CA. Is there any good Chinese food in Vegas ?"}
{"text":"First time customer and was not disappointed.  I have always liked China One and was happy to see that there was one closer to home.  We started with the fried shrimp as an appetizer - 6  in an order. It wasn't what I expected but happy to say, I was pleasantly surprised. They were tempura shrimp! Sorry for the excitement, but I LOVE tempura shrimp. Entrees ordered were Beef Chow Fun - very nice presentation and great taste. I ordered it extra saucy because that's how I like it and they did not disappoint. Combination Kung Pao - nice presentation, fresh tasting veggies ( lots of them), the shrimp really stood out to me but the whole dish was delicious.  Strawberry boba and Thai tea boba to go. Delicious!  We dined in and received great service.  Very clean and nice atmosphere. If you live in the Northwest area and are looking for quick and delicious Chinese food, forget about the big black and white  bear and go up the street to China One instead."}
{"text":"Always good, always fresh ingredients, nice portions. Reasonable prices, nice folks and great coupons."}
{"text":"Great food! Every time I go the food is made quickly. This is the best Chinese food in the area. The prices are average but the quality makes it worthwhile."}
{"text":"The food is great I usually go to the west location but when I'm on the east side I stop by here the only thing is the young girl at the cashier is always rude BAD BAD BAD BAD CUTOMER SERVICE !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery from China One twice now. I've never set foot inside their restaurant and cannot speak about the restaurant experience. Both times I've ordered shrimp fried rice and orange chicken. The fried rice is ok but it looks anemic. Like if you put their fried rice dish next to another Chinese restaurant's you would think China One's was the poor malnourished kid. The orange chicken was the same both times, bland and lacking flavor. I've made better orange chicken at home. At this point I think I'm better off trying out some of the other Chinese places in the area."}
{"text":"My order was delivered pretty quick instead of the 45 minutes to an hour the lady on the phone told me.  That's about the only plus I can give this place.  Despite the fast delivery they forgot to include my order of orange chicken...so I called back and asked for it to be delivered.  The woman laughed at me when I said I can wait for the delivery person to drop it off, instead of accept store credit.    Panda Express tastes better IMO, and they don't laugh or fight when they make a mistake..."}
{"text":"This place has amazing lunch specials  8.99 fresh hot and enough to feed two people! !!"}
{"text":"Very fast service. We came here for lunch and it was pretty busy but we got our food very quickly. The waiter was very polite and checked in on us several times   I got strawberry boba and it was very good but I think I'll try mango next time. They also offer taro. They're more like a slushee than a smoothie, though.   Food was fresh and delicious. We'll likely return!"}
{"text":"Food is not fresh. Teryaki doesn't taste good at all there are far better restaurants in the area"}
{"text":"The food has been fantastic, the staff friendly, and the atmosphere nice. I love stopping in even to get a taro boba tea, or to have a sit down meal with my husband. I have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is great. The customer service is excellent!! I came here a couple months back & I wasn't expecting much, but the staff here really made my night.  I had the tofu with eggplant, it was delicious! I had other vegetarian plates, they were pretty good too, but the eggplant & tofu was my favorite! I had a taro with boba to drink & I loved it!! This is by far one of the best restaurants I've been to in north Las Vegas. I came with my family & they all loved it! My dad seemed blown away by the food because it was so great. I can't stress enough how awesome the customer service is here. Very good energy in this place. I love it!!"}
{"text":"these people are thieves!!! do not use a credit card here. they will steal your information and wipe you out!!!"}
{"text":"Wonton Soup was very disappointing. Wonton soup is never served like this. It's like they had leftover food/vegetables and threw it all in the dish. Lots of filler product in it.  It's not how authentic and even western Chinese places ( that are good and even on average) make their soup.   Mystery meat in the soup, whole peas, carrots, cabbage, zucchini, three pieces only of  not even an actual wonton,  shrimp,  mutton(old age lamb),and bok choy.    Mystery stew rather than wonton soup.  Cheap product and not worth 8-9+$ dollars!  Complete rip off.    Not proper wonton, it's the wonton noodle over a piece of pork, it's not ground pork (or sometimes shrimp) like it should be.  Also, i did not have the bubble tea/boba tea but it did not look proper or authentic at all.   Why Asian places in Vegas who specialize in this or Asian food do not make it how it's supposed to be is mind blogging weird. They are truly ruining the food and the experience by giving you crap.   This isn't the only place that's like this either, seems to be a very common thing in Vegas, you are paying for something that isn't even up to quality or what it is supposed to be.   Is there no standards in Vegas for Asian food?    It's a shame because when Wonton soup is done well, even the frozen stuff is excellent compared to this. Because it is DONE RIGHT.   And why the ASIAN OWNED establishments are serving you crap,and not making it like should be.. people actually think it is good and how it should be, when it is not served like this ANYWHERE ELSE.  Wonton soup should not be filled with cheap product and mystery meat, it's a simple soup that you can't go wrong making. Same with boba/bubble tea, it should NOT BE A SLUSHIE IN  A SLUSHIE MACHINE!  Will not order again or come back. Not the real thing.  2.75 per wonton (three not even quality or proper wonton) and the rest is CHEAP FILLER PRODUCT FOR AN EXPENSIVE PRICE.  Heads up to anyone eating at Asian establishments around Vegas!! Especially this one!  JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE ASIAN AND OWN A RESTAURANT DOES NOT MEAN YOU KNOW HOW TO COOK ASIAN FOOD/PRODUCTS, DON'T BE FOOLED PEOPLE."}
{"text":"Still love this place. They actually make the effort to get to know you and remember your favorite item or what you've been up to."}
{"text":"Horrible rude device!! The wontons in my soup were raw!! The waitress got upset because I complained. The meat smelled and rice was mushy. Don't waste ur time. In the future I'm driving to china town."}
{"text":"Great food!! Get the egg rolls, they are crispy and yummy!!"}
{"text":"Good Chinese place been here twice. Love the Orange chicken and the fried rice. Very clean place with great service. Maybe I will change my rating after a couple more visits."}
{"text":"Meh.  It's your standard fare Americanized-Chinese food.  When I feel like Chinese and don't feel like driving all the way to Chinatown then I usually go here for the lunch specials.  The portions are ample and it's cheap.  I usually get the Mongolian beef or the chicken with hot garlic sauce."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that the food is delicious and the portion size is great. My husband and I had our food delivered earlier than expected which was fantastic. However, my only problem is the customer service. If I had better costumer service I would have given this restaurant 5 stars. I had ordered online on the China One website. It was pretty easy to order from. When I received my email confirmation the order had one different item that I had not ordered. I decided to call the restaurant to see if they had my order right. A woman answered and asked for my phone  number. She then told me that they didn't have my order. I told her that I had put in an order and she said maybe I had the wrong place to check my email to see where I ordered from. I explained to her that I had placed an online order at that restaurant. She kept insisting that I was wrong and that I was calling the wrong place. After a while she said we dont have your order. OK? Bye. And hung up on me. I was so upset that I tried to find a way to cancel my order but I had no luck. I called back after a while and I asked to speak to a supervisor or a manager. The employee who answered then passed me to another employee and I repeated my concern and she said that the manager was not there and to give her a second. For the next few minutes I felt like the phone was being tossed around to employees like a hot potato. Finally, somebody who I could communicate with spoke to me to verify my order. It was so rediculous of how unprofessional, unorganized and unknowlegable the staff is. By the time I was done verifying my order I had a headache. I just dont understand how it took 20 minutes just to make sure they had my order correct. I would have requested to cancel my order but that probably would have taken hours to do. I just hope that the employees are trained better because all this place needs is good customer service."}
{"text":"China one is that restaurant that is a little bit overpriced and the food is just good enough. I don't think there's anything special about China One. But my family and I eat there probably once or twice every two or three months. The Shanghai or the Senegalese noodles I forget what they're called that's my favorite noodle dish my husband loves the Hunan beef and my daughter is a big soup girl so she gets the wonton soup. They're pot stickers are good. If you're looking to grab some food just to be grabbing some food China One is good. This is not a place I would go for a first date or for a fun evening out this is that place where you're grabbing food to go or it's too late and you just need a decent dinner."}
{"text":"I never eat in I always pickup and go. I have always been really happy with the quality and the portions. Venture out side the normal dishes. Try the salt and pepper pork chop it's my favorite!"}
{"text":"Was really craving Chinese tonight. Just moved into the area so gave them a try. Got the beef and broccoli and a roast pork fried rice. Beef and Broccoli was mediocre. Beef was too chewy and sauce was salty and had too much cornstarch. Fried rice was decent. Thought about getting soup, but it cost about a dollar less than an entree! Total rip there. Onto the next place."}
{"text":"I ordered beef with spicy garlic sauce.   The beef inside my order was very chewy, spongy, and just the weirdest texture. The color is bland and just not right. It looked ok before I pulled out a piece and washed off the sauce before I realized... \"Ok, what am I eating?\"   Take a look for yourself and you tell me if your eating beef. Lol   But they do have a nice staff in there!   The cook might talk on the phone while he makes your meal with one glove."}
{"text":"Yum! We ordered take out on a Sunday.  Walnut shrimp, bbq pork fried rice, sesame beef & chicken lettuce wraps. Everything was fresh & delicious.  We had leftovers to snack on the next day. Definitely going back for more, apparently I must try everything on the menu from this place"}
{"text":"I had a similar thought as to one of the posters about not trying this place for a long time.  Having lived in Centennial Hills for three years, we always get their menu that have coupons.    We ordered Mu Shu chicken, chicken chow mein, butterfly shrimp, vegetable egg rolls, fried rice, fried won tons and a teriyaki bowl.  All of this only came to $40 and we had a coupon for a free order or orange chicken on top of that.   The portions are so huge that we'll be able to eat this for the next several days.  It's nice to find a neighborhood place that is different than pizzas and subs.  We can easily get the bill down to well under $30 next time since we won't have as many people at dinner and still have lots of leftovers for lunches and dinners.  Excuse me while I go take a nap now!"}
{"text":"My favorite orange chicken. But their ads say they deliver. I get the flyers in my mailbox but when I try to order it says they don't deliver to my address. That's frustrating. Either stop sending me delivery menu or deliver to my house ... I'm only a mile from you. .... Really good orange chicken though whenever I go get it."}
{"text":"Very reasonable pricing with the lunch specials. Fried tofu with chow mien here is super good"}
{"text":"Always love eating from china one. Although I only gone inside the restaurant twice, I always get food delivered and in the time expected. Driver always greets me with my name and is really nice. Food is great and you get a lot for what you pay for:)"}
{"text":"The vegetarian options are limited but the food is pretty fast and hits the spot when you are craving Chinese food. Some of the staff, you can tell English is not their strongest language but they are very friendly. I ordered Thai iced tea and asked if the milk was non dairy like three times and the lady assured me it was and watching someone make it saw that it was in fact very dairy milk. So be careful if you have food allergies!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times in the last year however today's service was downright terrible. We walked in and no one  was in the dining room.. Two other parties came after us and all ordered first with the food server (Nina) we ordered with a guy. The sweet and sour sauce is brown, I saw her pull it out of the microwave. It does not look fresh at all. I will not return here at all. I told Nina that I will not eat the food and she was very rude and said if you don't want to eat it I will just throw it out. She did not want to hear anything about the experience. The service seems to have changed in the past week. She didn't seem to want to make it right, just gave a nasty attitude. Something needs to change here. It became DISGUSTING."}
{"text":"great food!! It actually reminds me of new york chinese food. They have good delivery times and prices."}
{"text":"The service is very quick and efficient. The server was friendly. We each ordered our own entrees for dinner and left very full. You have the option to have the sauce on the side when you get sweet and sour. Get it on the side so your food isn't drowning in the sauce. Good value for $8.95"}
{"text":"we allways order for delivery and it always good Great job!"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant! Food was amazing, staff was super attentive and friendly, and were kid friendly too! Highly recommend as the best Chinese i've had in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I love the pepper steak and pad thai...all the lunch special are great and the delivery driver is fast and friendly....My office keeps them busy with constant orders almost everyday..Highly reccomend eating here"}
{"text":"Boy I need to find good Chinese food and this is not it! Brocolli beef taste like oysters and crab ragoons seemed like the cream cheese was sour"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good here and a great price. We always have it delivered. The crab rangoon is delicious and so is the house fried rice."}
{"text":"Really good food at an amazing price. Definitely reccomend it. We ordered two of the lunch specials and both were really nice. Really big portions and the were only $7 more than enough for one person it fed all 4 of my family. Awesome sauce"}
{"text":"I had a SEVERE reaction to Whatever MSG they use and how much of it they used on my food. When I called to tell them I had a severe reaction they said it was the food they bought that has it in there. And that's it. No I'm sorry or anything. This is really one of the first times I have had this problem. Then night before I was short of breathe and had a severe migraine, then today basically couldn't breathe at all. So I will never go here again and if you have any allergies to anything especially DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place rocks!  The food is excellent and affordable.  Everything is made to order so its always fresh.  Their wonton soup is perfection! Filled with lots of wontons, chicken, and vegetables. My top pick is the Generals chicken. Their fried rice is really good too- lots of meat and veggies.  Take out is just as good as eat in; they also deliver.  The staff is really nice. The dining room is well lit and has a modern look-- but when you eat in, the food comes on styrofoam plates.  Still worth a visit... you'll be back!"}
{"text":"Found a worm when I ordered beef and broccolli. When I showed it to the server and told her that I wanted the pork chops instead, she wanted me to pay extra. I took photo of it. Not going back there anymore."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times for the shrimp.Sad to say I won't be returning.This week I witness an employee sweeping the floor then proceedibg to prepare orders without washing her hands.The one star is for the shrimp,it was the best I've had since moving to Las vegas."}
{"text":"I love this place. I always order takeout and admit I've never actually gone in, but their delivery is always faster than the estimated time, everything has always come correctly that I've ordered and their delivery people are always super nice and the food is great!"}
{"text":"I believe this is the best quality and best tasting Chinese food in Las Vegas...  It is clean and I never feel like I have to worry about having sub-par meat...   Paper wrapped chicken is great!  Sesame beef is my favorite dish and the chicken fried rice is a hefty portion with giant pieces of chicken.  Can't beat China One!"}
{"text":"Online food order confirmed at 6:54p on a Wednesday (non-holiday).  Received email stating we can expect delivery around 7:45p.  At 8:05, I call the restaurant concerning my delivery.  Gentleman on the phone says the driver cannot find the gate to our neighborhood.  (We've lived here for 3 years and have never had an issue with anyone finding our home.)  I told him the street it is located on and he said he would contact the driver.  (Meanwhile, someone takes a call in the background with another customer obviously questioning their delivery whereabouts.)  I called back to the restaurant at 8:25p questioning why we have still not received our delivery.  I am informed that the delivery driver is new and they will be sending a different driver out to deliver our food.  I have no idea why I had to contact the restaurant instead of being contacted directly by the driver for assistance.  I informed the gentleman on the phone that I wanted a full refund because I am not paying at this point, he then told me that he would be delivering our food himself (mind you this was AFTER I demanded a refund).  At 9p I call back asking what the heck is going on because no one has showed up.  He said that he cancelled my delivery and issued a refund.  (PB&J's tonight at our house)."}
{"text":"Omg this was the freshest Chinese food I have ever had in my entire life. I am use to the cafeteria style Chinese food places but this is fresh, fast w/ good service."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a Mother's Day feast at China One.  We were a party of 8 and every dish was a standout.  As previously reviewed, the Eggplant Dumplings are wonderful.  Chicken Teriyaki was surrounded by steamed broccoli, lovely Green Curry, Pad Tai, Egg Foo Young (large and plump)---all were outstanding.  This is a restaurant worth a special trip.  If traveling on the Turnpike, it is very close to the Butler exit."}
{"text":"Whenever we get Chinese food this is the place how to get a side of curry sauce they do a great job with that we also get the lo mein and crab rangoon"}
{"text":"I went to there for a takeout order, the person who took care my order was kind stupid, seems like she didn't understand exactly what I said.she lost her patience after......   then when I  got back to my apartment, the food wasn't really good! I won't come back. I tried another chinese restaurant facing the unlv university, I am happy with them."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery last night, which arrived quickly and thus the one star. The food was gross and greasy. The meat did not look good at all. We had the sweet and sour pork with white rice, beef and broccoli, house stir fried rice, and egg rolls. Not a fan of any of it. Wasted $40."}
{"text":"BEWARE!!! If you order delivery from this location, don't expect to receive a complete order. It took 3 phone calls and an hour wasted of my time to resolve my issue. We ordered at 5:45, waited for delivery guy at 6:40, only to open our bags to find half the order was in the bag. Called the store, and passed around to 3 people before someone could even talk about the problem constructively. No sense of how to resolve a customer's problem at all!  We asked to speak to manager and were told they have no way to get in touch with them (red flag). Big fat lie! Given the usual excuses of \"we are so busy\" \"only one delivery guy\" \"no manager here\". Told them it's obvious you have no manager because then we wouldn't have this problem of an incomplete order. Officially our order was not delivered complete until 7:25.    The next time you want to get what you pay for, I suggest any other Chinese restaurant than this one. They clearly don't care if they have happy customers unless you want to spend an hour and a half explaining to them how to do their jobs right.   Normally I would let a mistake slide and give the benefit of the doubt, but this hasn't been the first time and after speaking with everyone in the joint, I'm certain with the way they view customer service, they don't plan on fixing the issues leading to this common mistake. Go to a place that believes in GOOD service!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food that I have had in Cleveland. And I have tried a lot of them. You get a lot for your money and it tastes great also. It's a small place and it gets a little cold in the winter time. No place to sit and eat besides one table. Which is usually taken since there is only 6-7 seats in the whole place. But I call in my order all the time anyway. Nice staff. Very patient with difficult customers. And they remember their regulars by name and usual order."}
{"text":"Authentic, authentic Authentic!  Fresh vegetables, perfect flavors and seasonings.  Try the broccoli, cooked to perfection, not overcooked and not raw just right!   So do not expect chinese fast food with the wannabe orange chicken and eggrolls.  Try the Mongolian beef, just the right amount of hotness.  The peppered Chicken is very homey.  The Garlic Shrimp scrumptious and flavorful.  The price is just right"}
{"text":"I ordered the sweet and sour chicken and let me just say, it's VERY fresh!! I loved the flavor and texture of the entree."}
{"text":"reasonable prices & excellent food & quick service. we had the crab Rangoon & Orange chicken & it was wonderful. definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Just ordered from here, first time and last time. Chinese chicken salad: there was hardly any salad at all! And I asked for dressing on the side, they sent extra dressing on the side and soaked my salad that was in the take out box. I ordered two Wonton Soups, very blah in flavor and when I want soup it's because I want broth with my soup, there was not even much broth... Very disappointed. $29 for dinner, two soups and a salad & I was not very satisfied with my dinner. Guess it's time to try somewhere else."}
{"text":"We got seated promptly even though it was busy and the Boba is decent. The only thing that wasn't great was the food itself, the chicken was chewy and everything tasted old in a sense. I would come back for a side of steamed rice or something simple because it was convienant and the service was prompt but other than that if you are looking for good Chinese food, I'd go elsewhere."}
{"text":"We went here on a Friday evening for take out. Let me tell you they were quite busy which is probably why they couldn't answer the phone. Service was okay however it took ba while to get our food because they make it fresh when you order it.   We ordered house fried rice, house low mein, ant sweet  and sour pork. Everything was pretty good except for the rice. Seems as if it was white rice that they made turn brown. Both the rice and low mein had plenty of meat so that kinda made up.   I probably will go back and give them a second chance since it's so hard to find a good chinese food  place. Nothing like the good ones in L.A."}
{"text":"We really like this place. We go to have a sit down dinner, but I notice a lot of take out orders being prepared.   The service is friendly , the food is good and prepared quickly.   We like the orange beef, sesame chicken, and the honey walnut shrimp is very yummy.  We also love the taro boba drink. I love the boba and taro is the best because it's not too sweet."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our meal.  Hot and sour soup is full of seafood surprises and is awesome.  Shrimp and lobster sauce was so tasty. Pad Thai was great!!  Don't miss the delicate crab Rangoon.  Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Not bad my opinion best house rice and orange chicken on the West Coast!..... so far in my nine years here."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten here in over two years but decided to give them another shot and the food is just terrible. Bbq spare ribs so dry and the fried rice is just not good. Reminded me why I have avoided eating here."}
{"text":"Stay away from this place. My wife and I ate at China One last night and we got food poisoning. Service, food and overall cleanliness is not good. I would stay away. I would complain however I don't think they would understand me."}
{"text":"We ordered around 4:25, and it took almost an hour for delivery. The sweet and sour chicken had A LOT of green peppers and onions. I liked that the sauce came separate. I got chow mein noodles instead of steamed rice, and although it's an upgrade, it's nice to have the option.  What was gross though was the crab Rangoon... absolutely DISGUSTING!  I can't even begin to describe the taste.  Perhaps burnt hot dog?Were they fried in old oil, or they put some random seasoning in mix, or if the filling was bad? This was my first time trying China One, are the Rangoons always this terrible?  I love the ones at China-A-Go-Go!"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience here, tough I've never dined in. I order to go. They have great food. That's all I needed."}
{"text":"After moving here from the S.F bay area I had a hard core Chinese food craving but was trying find something close to home. The food was good. A bit crowded. Best for take out.  Mongolia beef was awesome. Chicken wings are yummy. Quality and service was a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"My favorite neighborhood spot when I'm in the mood for some good Chinese beef and broccoli!"}
{"text":"There are a lot of Chinese restaurants in Summerlin and lot called China One. This one in the Smith's shopping center at Rampart and Lake Meade is the best:  1. Lunch prices and portions are excellent and tasty. 2. The most impressive thing is that the \"fried rice\" option for lunch is gigantic and is served on a separate plate. It has the required extras such as eggs, carrots, peas, bamboo shoots, not just \"rice\". 3. Unlike other Chinese restaurants, food is served on real plates (not paper or in cardboard boxes) and the booths sit on tiled floors. 4. The dining experience is \"eat there\" not \"take out\" (although we have done take out). 5. The wait staff is friendly and cooperative.  I have lived in Las Vegas now for 5 years and this is my first Chinese restaurant review."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Saturday afternoon to grab a quick lunch. Got the lunch special for around $5. Not too bad for a large portion of orange chicken with plain chow mein and fried rice. The food was good, but I wouldn't get the fried rice again. It was bland and dry. Also got a Thai Ice Tea with boba. The boba had a great consistency just the right amount of chewiness :) will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Good food. Fast delivery. Polite employees. The estimated delivery times for food can sometimes be long enough to sound discouraging (especially if ordering through an app), but they have always arrived for us within 30 minutes regardless of their estimate. It's hard to make a recommendation for food, because literally everything we've ever had has been delicious. So order one of everything and chow down."}
{"text":"It's basically your typical run of the mill Chinese food restaurantn but's better than the other Chinese food restaurant in the neighborhood. Very fast service in store, delivery times vary but they run on the faster side.  I would order them if I just wanted to stay near home, but if I'm taking family or friends from out of town, there are better places around town."}
{"text":"We had the wonton soup, pot stickers, and foil chicken.  Used yelp for ordering and food took 30 some minutes to arrive but it was right before closing.  The food arrived hot, and packed well.  The wonton soup was nice with fresh snow peas, water chest nuts, and baby corn.  It had nice large pieces of BBQ pork, and nice wontons--a little soft but great flavor.  The pot stickers seemed steamed but not the traditional wrapping and they were tasty.  The foil chicken was very hot and flavorful with bits of yummy onion.   Order came with sauces and fried wanton strips.  A great Chinese take out night!  Updated:  the wontons have never been soggy again.  Love this place but too busy to dine in on Friday nights"}
{"text":"Where do I start. First I thought I was calling the former tenant China Diamond for my takeout. Was quite shocked when I found out they were gone. I had ordered beef with pea pods & mushrooms, fried rice and BBQ pork. All terrible. The fried rice was flavorless, except for the and had very mushy carrots and oddly colored carrots in it. . The beef was a little bit of beef with a lot of vegetables and the brown sauce was runny. The pork strips were very fatty. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Heard about this place when I got a sheet of coupons in the mail. Checked out the menu on the back and found out their lunch specials are valid til 4PM- I'm in! I called in my order on my way out the door from work, and swung by to pick up on my way home. Was told it'd be ready in 10 minutes, was packed and waiting for me when I walked in the door.  Got home and it was still piping hot, always a good sign. Went for the won ton soup and the combination kung pao lunch special with half-and-half side of chow mein and fried rice. Bummed that the egg drop soup isn't included in take out lunch specials, but I had the giant soup instead. Used a coupon for a free 2 piece of egg rolls or rangoon (picked the rangoon) with $10 minimum purchase. Side note- they didn't take the coupon! I may use it again...  Overall, I was satisfied with the food. The soup in particular was good and despite sitting around for a while, the won tons were not falling apart- a couple, but not enough to make a sweeping statement or a negative impact on the dish. Lots of variety in the soup: bits of bbq pork, shrimp, and veggies in the broth, and plenty of won tons. Would get this again. Initially thought the $6.50 price tag was steep, but it's a meal. The lunch special was also $6.50, and a hefty portion, too. Compartments of the styrofoam takeout box were overflowing- fried rice was moist but a little boring, chow mein was chewy and a little plain, both both balanced out the crazy combination kung pao. I say crazy here in a good way though- it was a giant portion with every meat mixed in, and quite a bit of chopped veggies, too. Spicy but not enough to scare anyone off, flavorful would be a more accurate way to put it. I did pick out the chiles before I started eating, but was really surprised to see five in my portion. FIVE! So if you're down for spice, go ahead and leave those in. The rangoons were a nice little treat, small but indulgent, not too much cream cheese, either.  It's so convenient, and the coupons are a nice touch, and the well-priced lunch specials in giant portions (this is easily lunch for tomorrow, too)? I can safely say I'll be back."}
{"text":"They have the best chinese food in the Centennial area, plus they deliver."}
{"text":"do not eat anything here you will get sick . i saw the server  touch raw chixken beef and shrimp and grab cooked rice with his  bare hand  put it in a togo container.  wipe his hand on his apron  sneezed in his hand and grab raw vegtables  .. this place used to have a d  per the. health department rating im not sure why this place is open ...  buyer beware."}
{"text":"Food is good, not great, a little salty for me. I don't like crab rangoon but theirs was actually flavorful. SERVICE was Spectacular. They asked if I wanted water while waiting. Then I watched as they brought out soup to an older couple and dished it out for them.  Enough said. Then to top it off, I finished my co of egg drop soup and they asked if I wanted more. Pleasant service from Scott.  Thank you."}
{"text":"I've been ordering from this place for a couple months and have always loved the food however the customer service is severely lacking. After tonight I will no longer be ordering from this restaurant. The person taking my order could not get it right, the delivery took a half hour longer than expected, our order was incorrect when we got it and when we called them to tell them what was missing and wrong they said they weren't sure if someone could bring the missing/incorrect items. They will not refund anything but they will give a credit which does nothing since I will not order from them again."}
{"text":"Ordered food and had it delivered, and was very unhappy with the outcome. The food wasn't as good as I was hoping, and in the orange chicken there were at least two or three hard pieces which turned out to be bones. Even the fortune cookies were bad, it tasted like cardboard! Wasn't happy with the overpriced food at all, sorry but you just lost a customer."}
{"text":"Order take out and it was horrible , I was over charged as well for some dry chewy pork chops , it was gross , it was my go to place to order when I craved for Chinese near home but I'd rather drive to China town and get some real Chinese food instead of this crap . Never again I'm done with this place"}
{"text":"Just opened-cute place, good food, great lunch specials, but there is something in the food...that makes me feel ick...I'm guessing, MSG. Half of the people at my work said the same thing, half were not affected."}
{"text":"Rice got spoil way to quick and food was way to greasy as far as the shrimp fried rice and beef chow mein :( BBQ sliced pork was old burnt hard dry and keep getting stuck in my teeth :( had the bubble guts :( I don't know what happen.. I usually order here all the time! This was around lunch hour trying to get the lunch deal but booo!"}
{"text":"Went here last night.....horrible food. Pretty cheap...but when we sat down to eat at home there were chunks of gooey stuff mixed in with both of our meals. By the second bite i was literally puking outside. Went back this morning with 2 almost full bowls of general tso and bourbon chicken for our money back. At first she refused and finally agreed to give us 8$ out of the 13 thay we paid. Her reason for not refunding the whole bill \"you ate some!\" Prices are cheap for a reason. Do not eat here"}
{"text":"This place was okay. I got General tso chicken delivered. Delivery took about an hour and the food was mushy upon arrival-but that's normal with delivery. Flavor was good. I was a little upset that they rang the doorbell because I put in the special instructions to call me and NOT ring the doorbell. But it happened-oh well. I love how you can pay $1 more to get all white meat chicken. Overall this place was okay. I'd try it again for pick up or eating in."}
{"text":"We found China One this evening on the way home from skiing. To our pleasure it was the grand opening!! We ordered egg drop and hot and sour soup, an egg roll, Buddha Delight and Chicken Teriyiki. Portions were wonderful, service was awesome and the food was delicious! BEST egg drop soup we ever tasted! It was a joy being one of their first customers!!  We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and ordered the orange chicken special off the lunch menu. The staff is super nice and the place is clean. Small seating area, but still nice. They gave egg drop soul as part of the lunch special. Not bad tasting at all.  My order of orange chicken was on front of me 10 minutes after I ordered!!!! How awesome is that. It was hot out of the kitchen steaming in front of me. The portions are quite generous too; ANOTHER PLUS! After letting it cool down a little,  I tasted the goodness. It was very enjoyable. A very positive experience here"}
{"text":"Last resort Chinese delivery. Food is too greasy and overall just lacking in quality."}
{"text":"I won't be going here any more. Phoned in an order for shrimp with snow peas. Menu states: \"Snow peas, napa cabbage, carrots and water chestnuts in a light garlic sauce\". I asked for no water chestnuts. Well, when I got home after picking up my order I found they didn't put any water chestnuts in it but they DID put in cucumbers. Don't like cucumbers but the wife does, only reason I didn't go get a refund. Make sure you ask what goes in your food before you order."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place. The food, service, and atmosphere are much better than your standard Chinese takeout place, but the price remains quite affordable!"}
{"text":"The food was DELICIOUS!!!! came in on a Saturday afternoon and was seated right away, it was quiet and the staff was friendly. I will eat here again."}
{"text":"Oh China One...I'm back with an update.  We've been her about 6 times now and the last 2 times they can't seem to understand our order.  I don't know if it's a language barrier or they just don't listen.  The first wrong order was a completely different item than we ordered and they got very irritated when we told them it was wrong and the employees were all yelling at each other.  Awkward.  Second time we ordered it was two dinner specials and instead we got individual items.  Not a big deal except that then there wasn't enough egg rolls and things to go around.  I honestly can't figure out what the problem is.  We knew we had issues last time so we showed the cashier what we wanted on the paper menu...did not help.  We may give up on this place and go back to our old Chinese restaurant which is slightly more expensive but way less Frustrating."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying I made a mistake with the delivery address. My mom is sick and house sitting so she texted me the wrong address. That being said, I called the restaurant to correct the situation and the restaurant was incredibly rude and all they kept saying was that I was causing them huge delays. Mistakes happen. When you're in customer service I certainly hope for a little more professionalism and courtesy than what I got. They claimed they didn't have a manager on duty to talk to, so I called the restaurant several times trying to get the order corrected and then the driver was rude to my mother and said how dare you make me come out here twice. Excuse me?! I will never be ordering from this restaurant again and you can bet I'm posting this on all of my social media accounts so that people know how they treat their customers. Like I said, I fully admit it and apologized for the mistake in the address but I certainly didn't deserve that kind of treatment neither did my mother. I definitely won't be ordering from this location again."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here while visiting some family in Vegas. Pretty decent Chinese take-out. I remember the honey walnut shrimp being pretty tasty and the food not being terribly greasy. They gave a few boxes of extra white rice, which was very considerate. And they included some won ton pieces that were great to snack on. Could use more of those on a daily basis if I'm being honest. Definitely scarfed it all down after a day in the swimming pool. I think it's my cousin's go-to take-out place now, so we're definitely fans."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good! We ordered sweet n sour pork, beef n broccoli, Mongolian beef and egg rolls. It's very close to where I live so decided to drop in. I REALLY liked their taro smoothie. I'm going back soon just for that delicious smoothie!"}
{"text":"Chinese fast food at its finest, large portions and the dumplings look like they are home made, sauces were very complimentary. Service was good. Orange chicken was great, not full of chewy deep fried breading. Soup was good too."}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch! They always give you big portions for around $6.50! No way I can eat it all for lunch! The only place I go for Chinese take out in the area!"}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian but I eat an abundance of vegetables.  I was pleased that China One added a variety of vegetables to the chicken in hot garlic sauce:  bell pepper, jalapeño, carrots, onion, wood ear mushroom, white mushroom, and I think a snow pea or two snuck in there.  The dish was stir-fried to order and served piping hot.  My lunch came with egg drop soup, half chow mein, half fried rice, and a little dish of fried won ton wrappers and sweet dipping sauce.  Employees checked on me three times to see if I wanted more iced tea.  Solid food.  Solid service.  Not bad for under $9 including drink with refills."}
{"text":"Wow talk about amazing customer service! We order from here and take out once in a while because its so close to our house.  The last time the cashier helped me grab my babys bottle from under a booth, picked up her binky from the floor, so nice! The food is really good and I am really picky when it comes to Asian dishes but Ive liked every thing weve tried. Bbq pork is really good, not fatty or slimy. Singapore noodles yum! Hot n sour soup my boy friend would eat every day. Pad see ew, chow mein, w and boba tea perfect for two ppl.  Add some egg rolls and crab rangoons maybe some egg drop soup perfect for a family of 4 and under 30 bucks."}
{"text":"I placed a delivery order tonight'' 3/8/13 My food took a hour to get here'' I am ok with that'' But it was cold:{  and I had to call them and tell them my shrimp chop suey was  awful the shrimp was rock hard and it tasted old. I did call them and they would not take the item of the bill, they offered me a credit.  I do not want to order again from them''it was just that bad. And when you have worked all day and you do not want to cook - and you pay for a bad dinner'' who wants a credit'' I do not/ REFUND me''' as I could not eat part of my dinner and what I could eat had to go in the microwave. Never Again!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service! We even got free egg rolls thank you again for a great meal The veggies taste super fresh super delicious"}
{"text":"I have no idea how this they received so many stars! Friends/employees maybe. My husband and I ordered 3 different dinner dishes, honey walnut chicken, chicken and green beans and Hong Kong style chow mein (along with a couple apps). Not one dish had a piece of chicken! Every piece we thought was chicken was actually a big \"flap\" of chicken skin. Every piece! You could actually see the bumps where the feathers were. Every dish was flavorless and disgusting.  We threw most of it away after we tried to pick the veggies out. It really sucks because the delivery time was quick and they are very nice on the phone."}
{"text":"We just stopped in to order dinner and the lady was very nice, the place wasn't very crowded and the restrooms were clean!! The food was exceptional, but better then most Chinese I have found in this area. The parking lot is kinda crazy people in there don't really pay attention its a mad house out there"}
{"text":"I had lunch here for the very first time. I am the minister at the Church directly across the street so I've been looking at this to-go spot for a long time. Finally I go in all happy & smiles like usual and I got sourpuss. There was no personality, no niceties, no smiles, no nothing not even a stare. She held her pencil looking down at her pad like \"what you want?\"  I placed my order, went to the bank & came back because they don't take credit cards. They started cooking it after I paid but it was quick 5-7 minutes.   Serving portion was huge but way too much sauce & my veggies were huge so I had to cut them into bite size pieces. I'll try something different next time. Only 3 stars for how I was treated not the food. It's hard not to at least smile at me. Ijs"}
{"text":"If you are looking for Chinese food I don't think this is the place. The wonton soup had huge chunks of cucumbers, carrots and pea pods, as well as chunks of chicken skin. This is definitely not authentic style Chinese. The fried rice was also not authentic either and the fried chicken wings had a bad tasting coating. Probably the worst Chinese food in the area."}
{"text":"They are stupid as shit and I had to fucking tell them my address over 10 times in a row and spelled it out letter by letter and still they kept asking what my address was. Do not order from here, complete waste of my time."}
{"text":"I had the vegetable fried rice, chicken dumplings and vegetable egg rolls!! All was delish and great delivery time as well!  I will reorder!"}
{"text":"I use to love the food here. Very fresh and the portions are big. I would order like once a week since there grand opening at this location. I haven't been here in a couple of weeks so I decided to order from here yesterday. I was disappointed. They changed there chowmain noodles which were my fav. They now taste and have the consistency of Top Ramen noodles that you buy in the packages at Walmart. I also had tried the walnut shrimp which I thought was pretty gross, seemed slimy to me. However, the wonton soup is delicious, one of my favorites.The customer service is not great, every time I call in my order whoever answers cannot understand me. Very frustrating. I'm hoping the quality of the food doesn't continue to go down hill because I really did like this place and I am very picky."}
{"text":"This place is awesome if you can't get to Spring Mountain Rd.  Hot, fresh, tasty the BEST Chinese out this way (and I have tried lots).  The staff are super friendly, the place is CLEAN.  The fish in black bean sauce is my favorite.  Big portions great prices."}
{"text":"Love the staff at this place and the food is really good as well! Egg rolls are crispy and delicious, the lunch specials are a great deal and they also cater!"}
{"text":"I have been ordering Chinese food for so many years in my life, and this restaurant is probably the best Chinese food I've encountered by far!   They're very friendly and immediately added some spring rolls for free after I was done ordering food.  The food tasted AMAZING! Everything was top quality and very flavorful!!!! Portions were spot on and the delivery didn't take as long as they said it would!   The only \"negative\" is that they don't offer dessert...but hey, it's alright!"}
{"text":"Chinese takeout has never tasted better!  This place raises the bar as far as quality, cleanliness and taste.  The kitchen is in complete view from the dining room which is rare for any 'fast food' establishment.    The biggest surprise is the fact that all food is cooked when ordered and my last bite (that I could handle because of the big portion size) was as hot as the first bite which is way more than I can say for other heat lamp restaurants.  The staff is great and the lunch specials are a great value.    All in all, this is a game changer in the takeout business and a great find"}
{"text":"Pretty straight forward here. It's Chinese take out. Not really traditional Chinese food but the Americanized version most people are accustomed to. Nothing amazing but they get the job done at a great price and they deliver, which for the area is a treat!! I'll go back because they have a consistent product and average service."}
{"text":"Ordered through their online website and it was so easy. Delivery was in a reasonable time and food was very fresh! Tasted great. Not loaded with salt. I will be ordering again"}
{"text":"I ordered chicken chow mein, vegetable eggrolls, and fried dumplings. When LO MEIN arrived, I called the restaurant. They told me that lo mein and chow mein are the same thing. In what universe? They even gave me the crispy noodles to go with chow mein. Just ridiculous. And, as you can see in the picture, the lo mein wasn't very good. Nothing but noodles and a little bit of chicken. No vegetables to speak of. The eggroll and dumplings we're good, though."}
{"text":"The customer service here is always great whether I eat in, take out, or get delivery. Love their soups it's always ALWAYS steaming hot. Their boba drinks are always good, Thai tea is the best and yes you can still get boba in it. I don't know of any Chinese food that is t greasy so idk what all the complaints are for in other reviews they should have gotten a salad at some other place if they were so concerned. Also the food here isn't super greasy it's just right. I will continue to choose this place as my go to for Chinese food"}
{"text":"If you want amazing Chinese food on a Thursday evening look no further! I asked for spicy but not so spicy combination kung pow and it was perfect.   Keep in mind that they deliver SO FAST. Like faster than you could put on pants. My order was delivered in 15 minutes.   Super nice delivery guy didn't mind my vicious spaniels licks and barks.   10/10 would order again! Thanks for not making me cook dinner!"}
{"text":"every order i have place with china one on s rainbow has been truly great food.  i don't understand what is happening with my order today, i have ordered form china one both from work which is only one mile from my home and i have also ordered from home...each order has been for deliver.  today i placed an order and was watching for where i could enter a different payment but my order went through with no additional payment options.  i called the store (s rainbow) and tried to change my payment method in store but they said they cannot help me.  i said that if you deliver an order that is not the payment method i approved i will have to report fraud.  i ordered a second order with my desired payment method and i'm sure it will likely be uneventful and be a normally ordered delivery and normal payment for the payment method that i entered online.  just want to give all a heads up that they may experience difficulties such as mine, but if not, then you are able to enjoy the whole experience."}
{"text":"Got food poisoning from this location! DO NOT EAT HERE. Was awake all night long and ended up having to go to work the next day still and was sick for a total of 18 hours..."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price! So far I've only ordered takeout but the food is always delicious and the portions are a large size. Most chinese carryouts do provide a good size portion but this place by far has the best tasting chinese food I have found in the area. Check out their lunch specials for delicious chinese food at a great price."}
{"text":"The General TSO Chicken was great and I loved the Taro Smoothie. The Salt and Pepper Shrimp did have a different coating than I anticipated but it was still tasty."}
{"text":"Horrible!! ETA is 1 hr after I ordered and it came 1 hr late.  I have to wait for 2 hrs for my food."}
{"text":"Food gets delivered hot and fast. Everything was there there was nothing left out when these days that goes along way. I'll be definitely ordering from China One again"}
{"text":"Food tasty and served quickly. Place is more designed for takeout, only 6 tables. No real ambiance or decor, but food was some of the better Chinese we've had in NW area of town."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! Best won-ton soup I've ever had, pepper steak to die for and the walnut shrimp I could eat everyday for the rest of my life! The portions are great, the delivery is fast and the staff is polite and honest!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Fast, hot and delicious. We don't usually stray far from our go-to items like orange chicken, beef and broccoli, chicken and broccoli, egg drop soup and fried wontons. Try this place, I seriously doubt you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good food, excellent service, big portions, and great prices. What more could anyone ask for."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but this is not good Chinese food; compared to what you can get at other Chinese restaurants in the area its just gross; I tasted that their crispy chicken or whatever it was and it was not crispy and not seasoned properly.  Their steam rice was horrible.  Cold, hard.  I rather drive to other restaurants than go here for my Chinese food.  Centennial Hills still needs more good restaurants to open up in general.  this is an area that still needs to catch up in the food scene compared to the rest of the city."}
{"text":"This place isn't fancy, this place isn't fine dining, but boy is this place GOOD! The portions are HUUUUGE, the food is fresh and tasty, and the service is fast and efficient, even during their busy times. We often get the family meal for about $25.00, and it can quite literally feed 5 - 6 people. My boyfriend usually gets the General Tsao chicken or the Beef with broccoli and I get the green beans with blackbean sauce, but have them add chicken. DELICIOUS and you sure can't beat the prices!  And I wish that I could give them an extra star for having chinese almond cookies and jasmine tea. Yum!!"}
{"text":"My sister just bought this food one day ago and put it in the refrigerator. Then went to reheat it and it had mold on the noodles."}
{"text":"Most of the Chinese food in Las Vegas Is awful and higher priced. China One on Durango is very good and consistent. Service is pleasant and you can look into the kitchen which is clean."}
{"text":"My first time eating here. It was fast and I enjoyed their pork fried rice and the crab rangoons."}
{"text":"i thought for sure that i would never eat here and, if i ever did, i thought for sure that i'd hate it. being chinese, i'm super picky about my chinese food. but now that i live up in the northwest and find myself becoming increasingly too lazy to drive to chinatown for my chinese food fix, i broke down and placed a delivery order. mind you, i've yet to actually step foot inside the joint. yep, THAT'S how lazy i've become!!! therefore, they get an extra star just for the fact that they deliver! how awesome is that?  i received their menu in the mail, skimmed it and immediately thought \"this is some seriously americanized chinese food\". i ordered the most authentic dishes i could find on their menu. i'm so not a fan of the typical cantonese style chinese food. i'm taiwanese and prefer taiwanese, shanghainese, beijing and hunan style food. their menu is just about 99% cantonese.  that being said, i actually liked my meal. surprise! the delivery didn't take long at all, the food arrived piping hot and the order was correct. see, i'm not that hard to please. =o)  i will say this though... i wish they didn't bread everything. their fish in black bean sauce was actually quite tasty but they bread the fish which i totally don't like at all. i'd much prefer it if they didn't use any breading whatsoever. the salt and pepper pork chops also. the hubby said it would've been much better without all the floury breading.  other than that, i'd have to say that china one serves up some pretty satisfying dishes at reasonable prices. i'll be ordering from them again, i'm sure."}
{"text":"Have to say I'm EXTREMELY surprised at the quality of his place! I thought it was just another standard Chinese takeout place - and was used to places tasting so mediocre. But this place was different. Five words:  HONG KONG STYLE CHOW MEIN. YOU MUST TRY! Believe me, every legit Chinese restaurant, even in Chinatown MUST have this dish. Most Americanized Chinese takeout places, even Panda Express and PF Changs DON'T have this dish. Even some Chinese restaurants in San Francisco don't have this dish. But here it's featured, and it's a must try. By far my favorite food. Sure you could drive to our Chinatown in Vegas but this place is so convenient for us here in North Las Vegas.  The Seafood Chow Fun and House Special Fried Rice had shrimps the size of large prawns!  And don't even get me started on the service, it's not your standard takeout place, they'll serve you so well. And this is straight from the humble owner.  I should've listened to my Grandma who's been coming here for months since there grand opening. They remembered her and even brought her complimentary egg rolls for keep coming back!  They even had a wide selection including boba - and I have to say that you won't find a place with this quality, variety, cleanliness, and service for miles!   I hope this place stays here and becomes a staple!   Like I said try the Hong Kong Style Chow Mein, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here a few days ago after a year of not being back. When I first discovered China one, the food was addicting. That was back in 2009, and over time the quality has seemed to suffer a bit. The last few times I have ordered anything, the food has tasted weird or no taste at all, and the customer service has been dismissive. Almost as if they don't need customers. I generally order chow fun or green beans in black bean sauce and white rice. White rice has always been included when I ordered either one of these. I ended up taking a few bites of my food and just going to panda express after. Sad, but I will probably never be back to China One. There are plenty of other places to get some kind of chicken and white rice."}
{"text":"Oh em gee! I love there food then again I really love orange chicken that is really all I order haven't tried anything else which I should but definitely recommend"}
{"text":"We like this place better than all the other American-style Chinese restaurants that we have tried in the valley. The people here are generally very kind and put a high priority on customer service. The produce used is fresh and is never over-cooked. Though we usually order for delivery, we have eaten in the restaurant several times and have also stopped by to pick up take-out orders. The restaurant is always clean (including the bathrooms) and the staff always goes out of their way to be helpful and welcoming no matter how busy they are at the time. When I have come in with our kids, we have gotten help to our car with our food. The waitresses always take the time to speak in Mandarin to our children who speak that language and the delivery drivers do the same if the kids are at the door with us when they arrive. The staff remembers customers even if they haven't been in for a while. It's nice. We even had a driver run to our house with our food from our community's gate once when he couldn't get the gate to open and his phone was having a glitch (so he couldn't call). In this arena, I would rate them 4.5 stars if that were possible.   So, why the 3 star rating? Well, unfortunately, we have had a few issues with the food and, though it is rare,  I feel that with everything taken together, a lower ranking is appropriate. One of the first problems I remember is that we once got a noodle dish that had a big shaving of metal in it. I couldn't tell the origin of this with certainty. It is possible that it came from scraping a pot but from the looks of it, I think it was a piece of a metal to-go container (even though the dish wasn't served in one of those containers). It took a while before we ordered again, but a couple of orders later, we ordered vegetable fried rice with no egg and once I started eating it, I found a couple of chunks of egg and bbq pork in it. As a vegan, this was absolutely disgusting and disappointing. Just a few nights ago, we ordered again and there were stray pieces of meat towards the lower third of the container along with a few little bits of egg. Now, granted, these problems were more the rarity than the norm and they occurred over a range of time (along with several successful experiences) but they are also unacceptable occurrences to me. I tried to give the restaurant chances (after all, no place is perfect) and always politely let them know about the issues (not to seek anything for free but to give them information that could help them as well as other customers). However, after these incidents and a few others, I have decided that I am done with this place. The rest of our family may choose to dine there or order food from this establishment but I will opt for a different restaurant when they do (or simply make something at home).   A note to China One- We do really enjoy our experiences with your staff but the kitchen workers need a bit more guidance on cross-contamination and proper food handling. I realize that in a kitchen environment, accidental cross-contamination and other similar issues are always possible but every possible step needs to be taken to avoid these issues. With so many people having allergies and intolerances and lots of others following different dietary lifestyles (for a variety of reasons), food workers need to step up and be more cautious. Sure, people with these issues can eat at home most of the time but it is not that hard to be careful in a kitchen and I feel that every attempt should be taken to accommodate reasonable requests and needs expressed by diners. Thanks for reading and best of luck for a successful future."}
{"text":"Chinese eats are never my first pick when I'm hungry, but when I craving my one and only fav' Chinese dish, pan fried noodles, i gotta have it right away.   Didn't feel like driving all the way to Spring Mountain, oriental central, so thankfully Yelp helped led the way to this nearby chinese spot. Inside has some nice contemporary furnishings , Walls painted a nice dark grey, really warm and comfy inside.   Ordered the pan fried noodles, aka hong kong style chow mein. Noodles perfectly crispy, broccoli/carrots fresh, meat tender not chewy, shrimp plump.   My bf ordered Kung pao chicken lunch special comes with delicious egg soup, hot the way soup should be delivered, right? The nice part of it was the wonton strips served with a tasty orange zest sauce. Mmm-m-mmm.. Mm.  So the food is good, definitely better than the usual all you can eat, but of course I've had much better at a seafood house or china town. Not bad at all, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Delicious we order from this location often. The food is always hot and fresh . Chicken pad thai is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Under new management. Food is slightly oily now - not quite the same as it was before."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for years and it's always hot or miss. Well I'm done paying for food that's just bad. Picked up a lunch special yesterday and it was horrible. No taste n the chicken was not fresh. I had to throw it away!  So I'm done going here.  I tell anyone who's thinking about going here\"forget it\". Spend your money somewhere else"}
{"text":"Indifferent and borderline miserable staff, no custom dish orders are tolerated (e.g. you may not specify \"string beans only\" instead of the normal vegetables), noticeably smaller portion sizes than other China One locations, no brown rice, surprise water chestnut filler vegetable in most of their dishes, and on top of all that's wrong with this particular location, you have to keep your guard up in the parking lot (it's a sketchy area).  And a dirty bathroom to boot.  All China Ones are not created equal. Find another one."}
{"text":"Ugh. While it was exciting for my order to arrive 20 mins after I ordered, it did not make up for the food quality, taste, or texture. Orange chicken was very soggy (special instructions...I specifically requested extra crispy) and was very bland. Crab Rangoon tasted fishy.   Very unhappy...gets 2 stars simply because I didn't have to wait an hour for the disappointment."}
{"text":"I really didn't want to like this place since they replaced my favorite Chinese place of all time but... They actually won me over. The fried rice is rich in meaty goodness. I love the fact it wasn't served in to go boxes which seems to have become the norm. There wasn't a single dish that did not impress and the service was excellent. I suppose I will be back even though I live pretty far away now."}
{"text":"These people are always rude. The food is good, but only if you can get through order process without feeling humiliated for being Caucasian. I get related better at McDonalds. Just sayin."}
{"text":"Well, I was craving Korean and we wanted to try somewhere closer to our house. I guess this experience was \"my bad\"...but hey, someone had to try it right? As Kevin says, \"It filled our tummies\" and I must agree 100%.  The food was \"eh\"....okay.  I guess because we were hungry!  We definitely had waaaaay better Korean food.  (Stay tuned for my next review of it).    The outside actually looked pretty good.  Yes, quite opposite from other restaurants we go to (Hmmm...interesting...).  We went on a Tuesday about 430pm so it wasn't crowded at all.  There was just one other person sitting there,  The lady that 'somewhat' greeted us looked like she was one of the owners. I say 'somewhat' because she was distracted with her Korean shows that was blaring from the TV situated in the middle of the restaurant,  She was in front of that TV every chance she got.  We played it safe and ordered the bulgogi and chicken.  The dishes were $14.95 each,  They only had the \"cooking\" menu open at that time so we didn't have much of a choice.  They had soups and other appetizers but we opt not to have any.  I really wanted to try the seafood pancake but it was $16.95 (pretty steep for me).  There lunch special prices looked okay ranging $8.00-9.00 but that ended at 230pm.   When the dishes came out on a cast iron sizzling plates it didn't quite excite us. It came sizzling with just onions! The meat was soft but it definitely needed more flavor.  Same goes with the chicken (mind you, they used the chicken breast. I'm used to thighs.)  Now, let's talk about the \"sides\" given.  They gave about 6 side dishes.  One was a huge bowl of salad which consisted of just greens and the dressing was a simple rice vinegar/soy sauce with a bit of spice.  The other sides were the usual kimchee stuff but they didn't give much.  We actually had to ask for more.  One last thing, my husband being in the food industry business would always tip 20% regardless.  But I have to tell you that it's a big statement when he only tipped 15% at this place!!!  Alright, enough about this place. I'm sorry to say that this was the first and last time that we would be going here.  For anyone who goes and has a better experience. We're happy for you!"}
{"text":"Food delivery to my work.   House chow mein noodles - Good. Veg egg rolls - ok...just ok.   Requested chopsticks. No chopsticks. No napkins."}
{"text":"Mid-meal I step out to answer a phone call and TWICE the server gals lean out to ask me to pay my bill (that had just arrived at my table)  \"I'm on a phone call!  I'm still eating!\" I said.  AGAIN---a different gal comes out to give me the eye as if I'm going to \"dine and dash\" on a $12 meal.  Forget the fact that I have a new $35 iPhone 6 charger plugged in under the table.  Unbelievable.  Their average food and average location could have been an undeserved 4 stars---but it's now a very deserved ONE-star for the aptly named China One."}
{"text":"1 star- not because the food was bad, its not..the service is horrible.  they were late with my order, like 20 mins. and he was rude about it, but thats not why they get the 1 star.  After i sign the receipt, the guy look down at the receipt and ask me for a tip, i told him not to be late with food and then be rude about it, when i comment on it, now while in the lobby of my work, he yells up, \"you mean, i dont get tip becasue i was late, and i did a service for you\" ...yes that is right, and you can not bully me into tipping you, when you were late and rude.  i just walked off, but he was not done, and put on a show....about me not tipping him.  so if you order from there, just remember if you dont tip them because of bad service, they may try to strong arm you into doing so.  and the crazy part is i order from them all the time, and tip them well, so no more China One for me."}
{"text":"Food is made to order large portions excellent lunch specials after you go here you will not be going to Panda.  Also food is made by real Chinese Cooks that can't even speak English not like panda where Ramon and Jose that just crossed the border is making your chow mein. Lol"}
{"text":"Awesome food, great lunch deals! Order from here all the time and they practically know me and my dogs. LOL! Definitely recommend China One!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight. Order 2 basic dishes. Bar b que pork fried rice and bar b que pork. The fried was very good. The pork was tender and moist, The only thing I brought in the wrong coupon with an expired date of 09-30-2016. Most restaurants i know will honor them. This was minor and will return."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would!! This place is beyond horrible! I ordered food for myself and my 4 year old daughter at 6:07pm, and they gave me an estimated time of 30-45 minutes. I have ordered from this place several times in the past and never once have they been in the time frame they tell you at the time of the order. Tonight, 50-55 minutes later I called to get an estimate on delivery as my 4 year old has yet to eat... They tell me 5-10 minutes away and they have already left (mind you I live literally 3 minutes away, 4 if you get stuck at the light). 20 minutes later I had to call and tell them to cancel my whole order and refund my money because they still had not arrived to deliver my food. The lady spoke little to no English, and did not even bother to remedy the situation, or apologize for the situation. The people are rude, and have no mind for the customers."}
{"text":"Fraud and Theft. Purchased and Payed for my food, IN CASH April 23, through Grubhub from China One. On April 24, there was a bank charge from my GrubHub account from China One for $33.60. GrubHub kept us on the phone for 30 minutes in order to figure this out. That did not happen. After contacting the Fraud Dept of Wells Fargo, the card associated with GrubHub was deactivated.  Really China One? Really GrubHub?  You're going to cheat me out of money?  Really?"}
{"text":"Ewe ewe and more ewe!  I have to warn you this place is horrible!!  My party of 3 ordered potstickers wonton soup pepper steak sesame chicken and beef and broccoli!  We were all mortified!!  The friend rice wasn't gross but it was bland with no flavor at all!  The chow mien noodles were disgusting as well!!  And the fortune cookie, Not one of us would try it!  My daughter shockingly said this stinks as soon as she opened the package!  Sure enough it smelt like the dried worms I feed my turtles!!  I cannot believe they are serving the food like this!!  I wouldn't even feed it to my dog!!  We spent $48 plus tip and feel like I just threw my money in the garbage!  We barely touched any of our food past the first taste!!  Panda Express is 5 star in comparison!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise!  Fast, hot, and very spicy!  Top it off with reasonable prices.  This is the best hot and sour soup I've had since leaving Toronto.  Singapore noodles are sublime."}
{"text":"I have lunch here once or twice a month, and I love it because they offer brown rice (something the China One on Tropicana should do!)  I always get the Chicken Lettuce Wrap or the Chicken Teryaki Bowl. They're both excellent value for the price. The Chicken Lettuce Wrap is always enough for 2 meals, and the Teryaki bowl is usually enough for one dinner or two smaller lunches (for ~$5, that's not bad).  Quality is consistently good. Service is quick and friendly. I'm never disappointed, here."}
{"text":"The service was terrible. I made the mistake of dining in today. The waitress was rude, when I went to pay the girl was on the phone did not acknowledge me.  I ordered the Mongolian beef with chow mein, the chow neon was old tasteless. Waste of money"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food around! Fast delivery & awesome quality!!  Definitely my go to delivery place!!"}
{"text":"The crab ran goons and sweet and sour pork was great. Chicken lo mien was a tad bit greasy for me, but had good flavor. I do not recommend the general tso's because the sauce was a bit ketchup'y. Portions were decent for the price."}
{"text":"Food is always great they don't speak English too well so phone orders can get messy but they do a good job we go back constantly"}
{"text":"Consistently good, the delivery is always brought to the door with rapid haste. Give it a shot, you'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"Don't order the chicken wings. They taste like old fried greased. The only thing u can taste is the oil they fry them in. And there teriyaki chicken the smell makes you nauseas. Worst chinese restaurant"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this for the first time a few weeks ago and had to come back! I love the chow mein and rangoons. Soup is a very generous portion! Recommend to anyone looking for yummy Chinese."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken chow mein and asked for it to be extra spicy.  The chicken was tough and chewy and looked like it was frozen.  Extra spicy amounted to them chopping up a Jalapeño and throwing it in.  Will not eat there again."}
{"text":"This place is now one our favorite Chinese restaurants! My husband and I enjoyed dinner here tonight and loved our meals. He ordered the Sweet and Sour Chicken and received his chicken with the sauce on the side instead of poured on top. He liked this especially since his chicken didn't get soggy. I ordered the Cashew Chicken and it was very tasty, I enjoyed every bite! China One will now be our go-to Chinese food restaurant!"}
{"text":"Expensive. Food was cold, tasteless.   I had the General's chicken. Meat was tough, overcooked. Sauce was so sweet it hurt my teeth....  Not going back"}
{"text":"The food here is good. Im pretty spoiled when it comes to Chinese food because I know what the authentic stuff tastes like. But can't go wrong with the food here. Fast, tasty, and convenient and the people here are so nice."}
{"text":"We always order delivery from China One.  We have eaten inside but we like the convenience of having the hot fresh food dropped at the door step.  They seem to have mastered the efficiency of Chinese delivery from the ordering to the final drop off.    Some of my favorites are the Kung Pao Chicken, or General Chicken but I like it spicy.  They have dried red peppers in side as well as fresh jalapeno's inside.  Yumm!  Kick it up a notch.   The teriyaki bowls are also delicious.  The price of these is very reasonable for the amount of food they provide.  Other delicious items for starters are the veggie eggrolls or crab rangoon.  The ingredients are fresh and cooked to order and the spicy sauces very flavorful.   Once again this place is awesome for delivery.  They usually quote a long time of 45  minutes but our food is hot on our doorstep by 30 minutes or less...like the old Domino's Pizza prior to the liability lawsuits."}
{"text":"I must say....this is the WORST food I've ever had...orange chicken tasted as if it was fresh...fresh out of the FREEZER and then microwaved. The chow mein was soggy and the chicken was basically as chewy as bubble gum. Fried rice was decent and ended up becoming the main course due to rest of our meal being far from decent. It also took and hour and half for the delivery man to show up with, what I'd like to refer to as \"dog food\"....but actually I wouldn't even feed this to my poor dog. Cheers"}
{"text":"Times like this I wish Yelp gave us an option to add half stars so I can rate it four and a half. I've tried the Durango location and it was good, but my husband always told me this location was better so we decided to come down.   Their portions are very good. You get a lot of food for cheap. I got the orange chicken. It comes with white rice, but I didn't want any side so I saved a dollar and had them take it out of my order. My husband got the shrimp chow mein. Their chow mein is really delicious and the portions are huge. He couldn't even finish it and it was only $7 for it! They're very fast as well. Extremely fresh and I love it. Their food isn't already made sitting in the back or on display. Their orange chicken was so good. This location actually was better than the Durango one. Not only did the same food taste better, but even the service is better. The staff is so helpful and kind here when I usually get bitter and rude people at Durango. Amazing food, definitely sticking to this location!"}
{"text":"Eat in from take out containers. Wok not hot enough, food didn't have the needed wok hei taste. Egg drop soup bland, shrimp with lobster sauce bland with watery sauce. Chow mein had no greens. Fortune cookie was stale. My worst Chinese meal since a $4 AYCE buffet in San Diego 10 years ago."}
{"text":"Just got Mongolian beef and Kung pow combination! Bomb.com Best Chinese food hands down!"}
{"text":"Three stars is for the staff. They are really nice... Sat us and came by to refill our drinks. But the food, not so good. It needs attention. The teriyaki chicken was super sweet AND I LOVE SWEET. Rice was dry and noodles taste funky.  Not coming back but thanks for lunch."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but this is probably the worst Chinese food I have ever eaten and I've eaten A LOT of Chinese food.  We ordered two entrees and fried rice.  My husband's orange chicken could have been used as a door stop it was so hard and crispy and everything just had an odd flavor to it that I can't even explain.  I'm not sure what the other locations are like, but this one is dreadful."}
{"text":"I use yelp or delivery and they came quickly and was hot but I ordered combination chow mein and there was no meat in my Chow mein... Literally five pieces of shrimp no vegetables and no meat!! I was disappointed I don't think I will order from here again"}
{"text":"Hit or miss. Most noodle dishes are good and to be honest I'm weird and come here just for completely plain fried rice. So you think I'd be easy to please. But most meat dishes are sinew and gristle. Cheap lunch? Sure. Great night of a dozen boxes of takeout, chopsticks, wine and a movie? Yeah, no."}
{"text":"This has been one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in my area. The service is great and the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Love it!  The wonton soup is great and the service is terrific.  Great quality for such a small place and very clean."}
{"text":"We were in the mood for some americanized Chinese food so we tried this place for take-out. Bam! Hit the spot.  I had the moo goo chicken lunch special. Don't be fooled. The lunch special will be plenty of food. I'm not a small dude, and I was able to have left-overs the next day. It was a healthy dish with no deep-fried madness.    The quality of food was better than I expected. Although we only had take-out, the place appeared very clean and the staff was welcoming and attentive.   Only criticism is there could have been more chicken in the dish.  I will be back to dine-in foooo shoow."}
{"text":"We picked up carry out food last night, and were very impressed with everything. It was easy to order,  the food was ready very quickly, and everything was really delicious. We ordered a wide variety of dishes and everyone was pleased with their meal. One  big bonus was that all the food didn't have that overly salted aspect that many Asian takeout places do. We will definitely do this again. Such a huge improvement over the last restaurant that was there!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, delivery took awhile but it wasn't horrible. House fried rice is really good and the sesame chicken."}
{"text":"Hungry as heck last night, I found the closest place to eat in my general area and went for it. I entered the quaint establishment China One and was promptly asked \"for here or to go.\" \"For Here,\" I replied. A young girl motioned me to sit down at the booth closest to the door and take a seat. I was handed a menu and asked my beverage order. It took a couple seconds for me to decide on unsweet ice tea. I swear she was faster giving me the tea than it took for me to order it.  Since this was an Asian restaurant, I already had an idea of what I wanted and made the quick decision of General's Chicken. No not General Tsao's Chicken, just General's Chicken according to the menu.   I went to wash my hands in the bathroom and came back to see that my food was being served to my table. All of this took less than 10 minutes, where I arrived, placed my order, and got my food. It is important to note that their were 3 additional parties dining during this time.  So up until this point, everything was good.  However, when I got my food, I was not impressed with the quality of the chicken. It was breaded to a crisp making it hard to chew. Some pieces were inedible because of it's toughness. I could barely stab my fork into the chicken to break the breading seal. The egg roll served with my dinner should have been called a cabbage roll because that's almost all it was filled with. On a side note, the food was hot and presented at the perfect temperature.  So let me clarify, the staff was great, the place was clean, but the food wasn't that good. They earn 3 stars for everything else. I would only come back if they claim a revamp in cooking style. I took 90% of my food order to go, but I am not sure if I will actually eat anymore of it."}
{"text":"Huge portions, great service and the best Chinese food around. We will be regulars for sure! Four stars only because it is small and not many tables."}
{"text":"we went to pick up lunch and I happily sat down to eat the L12 (orange chicken). having started eating my chicken I noticed there was a couple hard pieces so I spit out my check to see what it was... lo and behold there were bones. Not one bone but three. I didn't say anything because I didn't feel like arguing with the manager. Every other time I have been to this restaurant I have never had a problem until today. I'm just very disgusted that they don't check for bones. you have just lost a customer."}
{"text":"My new favorite Chinese food place!   Everytime we come, we're seated right away. The restaurant is clean. The family that runs the restaurant is friendly and very courteous. I always order the Moo Goo chicken lunch and my partner ordered the Mongolian beef. The lunch combo comes with a drink and a bowl of egg drop soup. We ordered crab rangoons this time and they gave us two egg rolls on the house!  Everything is always cooked and seasoned to perfection. It's made fresh and there's never a long wait for food.   If you're looking for the best Chinese food in town, you've found it."}
{"text":"My friends and I went to this place only to get boba straws and came out with the Dinner A plan. We were greeted quickly and were handed menus. We ordered Dinner A which was $31.69 already with tax. It came with egg drop soup, two egg rolls, two of the fried cheese wontons, broccoli beef, orange chicken, and fried rice. We bought our food to go and ate it at home.  We finished our meal and it is probably the best Chinese restaurant to get broccoli beef. The beef was so soft and easy to chew. The sauce was great as well. The other food items were just as good but if you're looking for some good broccoli beef go here. I would definitely bring my family and other friends to this place."}
{"text":"Really bad Chinese food. Bad tasting rice. Terrible tasting sauce. Microwaved dishes. Yuck!!!. Will not return."}
{"text":"We've been here more than a handful of times and have never been disappointed with their food and delivery. The food is always hot and fresh"}
{"text":"I am from out of town and needed an order for takeout. I placed the order online. The order was ready when promised and was cooked to perfection. I really appreciated their attention to detail and warm welcome when I entered."}
{"text":"Not only do I love their food but they just made super happy... You can order online and have your food ready by the time you get there! Great for a busy gal like me!!!"}
{"text":"Worst service I ever experienced in my whole life. The server, Lin, was extremely rude and, when I pointed out that her behavior was inappropriate, she actually shouted: \"The customer is not always right!\"   I left a message with the owner, William On, who has yet to return my call. I may return here, since the food is OK -- although squash is not a traditional Chinese vegetable -- but only after Lin is removed from the job she doesn't deserve."}
{"text":"If you're not in a position to drive to the Spring Mountain Road area, this place is fine.  I've been a regular since they opened this location a few years back.  Earlier on, their food was more consistent and tasty, especially for a suburban Chinese restaurant.    You still get food that's cheap, quickly prepared, and in big portions but in the past 6 months, I've noticed a drop off in the taste and the food is prepared with less care.  I always order 6 or 7 dishes for my family and at least 1 or 2 always come too salty or with ingredients (chow fun noodles) that are not fresh.    I will be trying a different Chinese chain in the Centennial Hills area when I can't get the real thing in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Waited 2 and a half hours although they told me the driver went out with my food twice. I did a delivery order and the confirmation email said 40-60 minutes. After contacting eat 24 for the second time they finally tracked down my order. The restaurant refused to refund my money, the delivery driver showed up with my food cold and greasy, and the order was wrong. They gave me my mango boba with no boba. The dumplings were super greasy and not flavorful at all. And my lunch special general tsos chicken tasted off. They gave me an extra mango smoothie as an apology which would have been nice if it didn't taste gross. They told me to order from a different location next time because they are less busy, but that location had terrible reviews compared to this one. Overall this was a disappointment of great proportions. I ended up throwing all the food out and just ate an apple. Please spare yourself the unprofessional service and get good Chinese food somewhere else."}
{"text":"Very very sad about this place now. My last review was 5 stars cause I eat this place religiously. But today we sat there for 15 minutes, not even acknowledged and then when I went up front they told me it's gonna be 30 minutes before our food cause EVERY SINGLE STAFF MEMBER WAS ON THE PHONE. Horrible customer service and horribly managed. I saw they SCORED A C FROM THE HEALTH INSPECTION. Overall just a very horrible experience and I probably won't be back for a long time. They need alot of improvements"}
{"text":"Been coming to this location now for over a year, and it still has yet to disappoint. This location just simply blows all the other ones away. All the employees are very nice. Best Chinese food place in town by a long shot! Here's to another year of the best Chinese food in town!"}
{"text":"We ordered Ma Pu tofu with Pork, Singapore noodles, and won ton soup. The food was amazing. Customer service was top notch as well. Super friendly staff."}
{"text":"Soup was good, but not single serve size. Entree NOT good.  Chinese Chop Suey. No it was not. And it was not good"}
{"text":"Decent spot. Better than panda express. And they pretty quick with the food  Each I have been here, the food is consistently good.  Best Chinese spot in this area."}
{"text":"Steaming hot egg drop soup, wonderful fast service!!  This is a great all around place.  I have been here a few times and can't find a single flaw!  If you're feeling like Chinese they have every choice you could imagine and will also do special orders.   I like the black pepper chicken and ask for cashews and mushrooms and they get it perfect every time.  Can't wait to come back again;)"}
{"text":"This place is the best Chinese on the northwest side of town.... People friendly and the food is great... I recommend the chicken lettuce wraps... And Chinese fried donuts for desert"}
{"text":"Stay away, the negative reviews here are right. Noodles and meat were rubbery and bland. The most terrible Chinese food I've had, actually the most terrible food I've had in general.  Nasty.  Will never go back."}
{"text":"Best Chinese. Great price. Won't even go anywhere else for Chinese after having China One"}
{"text":"My family has eaten here in the past and they enjoyed it, so when we ordered food for our out of town guest we were expecting to wow them. The food was mediocre, the combination fried rice was basically chicken fried rice with a couple of pieces of shrimp and beef.  Maybe the food was different because this time we ordered it as take out as opposed to eating in the restaurant?"}
{"text":"I came here to grab my lunch before going to work and I asked for a substitute of just vegetables instead of having a container of rice as my side dish. I ordered the Garlic Chicken for $9.95, which comes with barely any vegetables and I cannot have rice due to a dietary restriction by a physician. When I asked to switch it, the lady behind the counter said I would have to pay for the addition vegetarian meal! That would have added another $7.95 to my order and given me two sides of rice-so wasteful as I told her I cannot eat it! I even said I'd be willing to pay an up charge of a few dollars, but not 8! After a nearly five minute conversation with them they said they would not substitute vegetables for rice without charging me for an additional meal. I paid a total of $16.16 for 6 crab rangoons (which they overdid) and a small container of the garlic chicken (which was practically a soup). This place is an absolute joke! Don't go here if you have any sort of dietary needs or want a decent meal. The staff will not work with you at all!"}
{"text":"For someone that isn't a huge fan of Chinese food, I tagged along with some friends to give this place a shot.  Was it bad?  No, not at all.  Was it the best Chinese food I've ever had?  Also, no.  Will I be back?  Yes, of course.  The service was stellar and I loved the little crisps and sauce that they bring to each table before food had even been ordered.  For appetizers, my group ordered the Pot Stickers and for entrees we ordered the Sweet & Sour Pork and the Lemon Chicken to split with fried rice.  Potstickers were amazing.  Sweet & Sour Pork was amazing.  The Lemon Chicken?  It was extremely sweet.  The picture they have on the wall showed just the chicken and we assumed that it would be zested lemon or some sort of seasoning in the crisp breading.  Instead, it was a thick lemon glaze that coated each piece of chicken.  One of my friends compared the taste to Fruit Loops cereal and after trying it, I had to concur.  That dish could have been much better with that sauce on the side.  Seriously, that's my only real complaint, that one dish we ordered wasn't 100% stellar...I still ate a good portion of it.    The food is good, the service is above and beyond and the menu is massive.  I'd definitely go back and try something else each time."}
{"text":"Food is good. Try the lemon chicken or the green beans in black bean sauce."}
{"text":"Good, fresh, chinese food.  It doesn't taste like it's been sitting around for hours and the veggies are actually crisp.  TONS of food for the price too.  I had leftovers for 2 days!"}
{"text":"china one must be paying money to yelp for advertising because I received an email telling me my negative review was going to be deleted. That usually only happens when businesses pay money to get us to shut up by deleting the honest reviews..  Disgusting food that is all I will say! I expect this one to be deleted too. Whatever! Four tries, four disappointments. Good luck!"}
{"text":"Food was bland. Ordered chow fun and singapore noodle. The chow fun tasted like old boiled water and Singapore noodles tasted as if they just threw a little cayenne pepper on. Very disappointed with the flavor so called the restaurant to discuss. The woman who I spoke with argued with me, stating that no one in the restaurant had complained about the same food. In order to get the refund I requested, they sent the driver to come back and pick up the food. The worst part was when that the driver brought a plastic bag filled with a partial refund. Apparently, the delivery charge was not going to be refunded. Have been trying to get a hold of a manager for 24 hours with no luck. Will never order from here again!"}
{"text":"My goto Chinese restaurant since I moved to Las Vegas. I don't know why I keep giving other restaurants chances to disappoint me. I like the Singapore noodles, egg foo young, house rice and eggrolls. Their delivery is always on time, and the food is fresh."}
{"text":"Delicious! Also very fast delivery! And cheap lunch specials! Friendly staff as well and relatively clean! Although I usually get delivery!"}
{"text":"I love there wanton soup it the best fast service and really good food i just moved here and was looking for a good Chinese place and they are the best i mean i have never ate a wonton  soup like theres before i highly recommend there soup you will fall in love"}
{"text":"We can order and pick up in 10 minutes or less! For under $12, I can get chicken fried rice, orange chicken, a crab ragoon, an egg roll AND soup!! The food and service and quick pick up times are what will keep us going back for more.   The reason for not giving them 5 stars is because we've never dined in and because they don't have duck sauce and are stingy with sauce packets!"}
{"text":"This place is excellent!! Service, cleanliness and very prompt. Recommend my all time favorite: MONGOLIAN BEEF!! Thank you all for great tasting food and service!!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience! An hour and 45 minutes and still no food. Front office stated there is no manager or supervisor on duty and they cannot refund our money. We have a long history of ordering from this restaurant and they have made no effort to rectify the mishap. The girl that answers the phone said the driver is out and has been out this whole time. Still waiting for the food...but i can imagine it will be soggy if it ever gets here. Dont order from this place."}
{"text":"Did a delivery order through Yelp. Order arrived pretty quickly. Orange chicken was a bit soggy but good. The beef in the broccoli beef had the consistency of rubber and went instantly to the trash can. 10/10 would not order from again."}
{"text":"Great food! Quick service! Always fresh vegetables. We got the vegetable (added tofu) teriyaki. Vegetable soup, egg rolls and my oh my were we impressed! This place is all about making the customer happy! Love love love it!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to China with the Navy and trust me, this food is legit. Tastes great, excellent price, and great customer service!"}
{"text":"Tried to confirm three separate times what would and what would not be in a simple one meal order.  No onions, celery or jalapeños was what I requested.  What was my meal loaded with when I got home?  You guessed it, onions, celery and jalapeños.  Shouldn't be that hard."}
{"text":"Not impressed with all the hype, dined for two here she got the pepper steak and I got the orange chicken, we both sported extra $2 for brown rice, we both got drinks to go. I heard all the reviews about how you get a bang for your buck here. I got the bill $36 later.... hmmm could of went to PF Chang's for that price for two.. and we could of had some saki there... haha. The food itself wasn't horrible... the pepper steak lacked that real meat taste... felt like we got a mushy substitute? My dog Cleo like the meat and chicken at home to so she gives it a 4 star."}
{"text":"Closest Chinese around that is decent. They do deliver and for a Family of five we get plenty for a not bad price."}
{"text":"First time eating here and the food is pretty good. We got it to go and once we got home I realized the sweet n sour pork looks nothing like what the picture at the place looks like, but instead the pork is breaded... I was hoping for what was showed but it was still good. My husband got the broccoli and shrimp and it was amazing!!"}
{"text":"Congratulations for new store opening,I must say china one is the best restaurant for me.food is amazing,servers are nice,any way,everything is perfect.so happy to see this location got China One.love you guys all the time.   Good luck"}
{"text":"The first time I ordered from here, the portion of Moo Goo Chicken was in a square container and there was a LOT of food.  It was HOT and VERY fresh.  I decided to go there again.  This time, the portion of the SAME thing was half the size as the first one.  It was still hot and fresh, but what's up with the difference in portion size??  This time it was in the same size container as the rice.  Disappointing after what I experienced initially."}
{"text":"Very weak-like broth in the egg drop soup, no taste, more like hot water with a lil salt. Overly pricey at 6.99   every where else the same size soup is $3.25....sal &; pepper pork chop was garbage. Undiscernable meat cuts. Hard as leather like a beef jerkey no taste cradled on top of loads of soggy wilted lettuce to make the container look bountiful..... what a ripp-off"}
{"text":"I would like to start off by saying I have been ordering from this place for about 3 yrs already. If you will be calling for deliver let me just say you'll be waiting forever. Every time I called for delivery they would always take anywhere within 40-1hr. But when I call they tell me it will be ready in 10 mins. I have always liked the food here. It's very tasty. The staff is okay. The girls in front can be a little pushy. They always look at the receipt as I'm about to sign it and maybe put a tip and the grand total. So that I don't like but I just look at them and they look away or I ignore it because well they are family owned and maybe they need extra money who knows. The fortune cookies aren't great but I think they purchase them not make them so that isn't really their fault. Overall it's alright. I really enjoy the food and that's why I always order from here."}
{"text":"Only 1 star for this place for the free thai tea to check in. Other then that super disappointed. Food was gross..chicken was weird and chewy...Wont come back."}
{"text":"I love the shrimp foo young. The gravy is very tasty and seasoned well. I wish it came with fried rice but it is still very good. I like the fast and prompt delivery. The driver is always courteous. This restuarant is great in my book. But I do wish I could get fried rice for no extra charge lol"}
{"text":"Dig the chicken fried rice here.  My fav fast good Chinese here in the NW LV area.  I think I'm hooked on it."}
{"text":"I get food from here once a week. Never find fault. The delivery service varies from day of week. Up to 90 minutes sometimes so don't wait till you're starving. My go to is the chicken in hot garlic sauce. Yummy. My husband can vouche for the orange chicken.  Always friendly staff and dining area is good."}
{"text":"Good, fast, cheap! General' Chicken is my go-to dish. It has a good spice and the addition of pineapple really makes it a winner. In my many visits, the only disappointment I've had is the chow fun, which is well below average.   Overall, this place is a winner."}
{"text":"This place has the BEST fast Chinese food. Never a bad choice. They are quick and very friendly. Always prompt in making sure you are satisfied and never hovering over you. I highly recommend any one of their several locations! China One - Great choice!! Enjoy"}
{"text":"Another local chinese strike out. Every time a new place opens near the house, my boyfriend insists this one will probably be good.. Sadly, even Panda Express would be a better choice, but at least it's better than Ghetto (Golden) China.  Hot and sour soup: $7 for a bland nearly flavorless soup.  Singapore rice noodles: didn't look bad, but had no flavor, other than a hint of spice. Hardly any meat. If you took some rice noodles, boiled them, and threw a pinch of red pepper on it.. It'd taste about the same.  Crab rangoon was ok, not great, but not as bad as the rest.   The only thing out of all of this that I could actually eat was the crab rangoon.   Boyfriend thought the mongolian beef was average, which I guess makes it the highlight of the meal.   I'm starting to think this part of town has an unspoken rule against edible chinese food.  UPDATE: Received this lovely compliment from \"Vegas Y\" - Hot sour soup and Singapore noodles both have strong taste! The soup is sour and spicy, the noodle has a lot of curry taste. If you thought those two strong taste dishes don't have enough taste, it's probably you have heavy taste on food.  Cute how the restaurant has someone to send \"compliments\" to customers who don't like their food... And leave negative reviews for other Chinese restaurants telling them to go here instead."}
{"text":"Great food and they deliver!!! We got orange chicken, house rice , chow mien, spicy shrimp, egg rolls, potstickers, it was A LOT of food. Was fresh and delicious! We will order from there again for sure. Thanks for the excellent food and very fast delivery!"}
{"text":"Service was great and I love the food . Especially my favorite Hong Kong style chow main. Very fair price."}
{"text":"Food is really great and the amount given is worth the price. Best local Chinese place ive been. Pretty small place to eat. Employees are really friendly and easy to work with when ordering"}
{"text":"I ordered Kung pao chicken spicy, Gyoza, and my wife ordered Teriyaki chicken by way of the eat24 app. My Kung pao was great! Texture, presentation and taste was all there. The gyoza was... different. Seems to be a home made wrapper that has a doughy texture, once you get used to the texture the filling is delicious and plentiful! My wife's Teriyaki was something not like any other we had, had before. This looked as if it were just baked, we are used to it being grilled or seared. The teriyaki sauce was very bland and equally watery, where we are used to it being fragrant, slightly less then honey consistency and very tasty. we couldn't eat it, sadly."}
{"text":"I order from here about twice a month. The delivery is fast and food arrives hot. The Hunan Beef is to die for. I also love their sweet and sour pork and orange chicken. This place is the go-to for Chinese food, in my opinion."}
{"text":"The portion size of the lunch special is very generous. The staff was friendly and the food was out hot and fresh. The sweet and sour pork is some of the best in recent memory. The Crab Rangoon was awesome."}
{"text":"If you can get past the horrendous task of repeating your address for 10 minutes (spelling it each time no less!) and get your order in, the food is actually good.  its too much of a hassle for me to put up with to put an order in though, they really need an online order form so you dont have to try to make these people understand plain english."}
{"text":"I'm a creature of habit so I can't speak for anything except the Mongolian Chicken. It's absolutely phenomenal!!! I've been coming here for years and it's still exactly the same. Delicious, hot, freshly made and ready in 10-15 mins. I give 4 stars only because I've never tried anything else but if we're talking about the Mongolian it's def a 5"}
{"text":"I understand everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but I am completely shocked at all of the positive reviews for China One. There is no doubt in my mind that all the reviews are either A - Basing their score on quantity not quality or B - Family members of the China One owners.  I admit it. I actually went to China One over ten times when I first moved to Las Vegas over a year ago. So when you read this mini-review, you can rest assured that this often intoxicated man with a really large appetite for Chinese food knows what he is talking about.   The only good things about China One are the amount of food you get for your money and the somewhat enticing coupons they send in the mail. You can get a FREE magnet and pen in store too, but if the place sucks and the ink in the pen only lasts about three seconds, I can't really consider those \"good things\".  As for the food, the beef and chicken entrees are chewy and the sauces are nothing that make you smack your lips twice to. The chow mein was horrible. I'd rather eat the packaging that it came in than that garbage.   If you ever want large portions of lackluster Chinese food or an extra bowel movement in the morning, China One is your hole-in-the-wall. Otherwise, I'd run for the hills, not look back, and settle for Panda Express down the road. Did I mention that the ultra generous staff at China One throw in a few fortune cookies that taste like their from 1985 too!? RETRO, DUDE!!"}
{"text":"The employees who work at this location are awsome. Great customer service and the food taste superb. I would come back again due to the great service."}
{"text":"It's what I want when I order Chinese food:) amazing Kung pao. Nice sticky rice. The right amount of spice for me"}
{"text":"Such good food. Everything is good. Service is quick. Lunch specials are reasonable. Takeout is prompt. The location and parking are easy to navigate."}
{"text":"Got some take out from here the other night and were very happy with what we got.  We ordered the meal B, which consists of two entrees, some apps, and a soup.  For our two entrees, we got the garlic shrimp and the general chicken (yeah not so adventurous on this one, but what the heck!).  The garlic shrimp was outstanding--a really nice mix of sweet and spicy with lots of yummy veggies and shrimp.  The general chicken was just ok.  Sauce was too sweet for my liking and the chicken, I dunno, it just didn't do it for me.  Lots of veggies, again, which you don't often see with the general, and the veg was tasty.  The wonton soup was outstanding. There were TONS of wontons in this soup along with heaps of veg, shrimp, and all kinds of greatness. This was probably my favorite of all the dishes we tried.  The apps (crab rangoon, a spring roll, and a fried shrimp) were really good too.     Services was friendly and efficient (placing the order was a snap and pick up was easy). Overall, I'll definitely be back here (we're new to the area) and I look forward to trying some of the other things the menu has to offer."}
{"text":"Amazing! I was searching Yelp for decent Chinese food and definitely satisfied with this restaurant! I ordered delivery thru this app, was estimated 60 minutes and extremely pleased when a knock on our door came after less than 30 minutes! Food was fantastic with huge portions! We ordered Orange Chicken, Combo platter, Teriyaki Chicken, BBQ pork Fried Rice and Sweet and Sour Pork. Also came with 3 containers of White Rice, fortune cookies and plenty of different sauces. Price was very reasonable. We ordered way to much for 3 people, plenty of leftovers! Definitely going to be our go to for Chinese food!"}
{"text":"The best, most spicy Mongolian beef I can get in North Las Vegas. I love this place!"}
{"text":"The service and food was really good. But what stood out to me was the fact they delivered to me so far from where they were located no problem. I accidentally ordered from a further location (this location) and still had my food hot and my drink cold. No problem what so ever."}
{"text":"Use to be the place to go, but little by little food quality has gone down. Ordered teriyaki chicken and gave me chicken jerky instead, like wtf? old dried up leftovers. I told the server to take it back and she said \" What do you want me to do about it?\" Really makes me want to come back. won't be back!"}
{"text":"My experience with China One was great!!!! The food tasted delicious and they delivered the food quick. The food was warm and none of it was soggy. Give them a try I will definitely call back. Big portions!"}
{"text":"This place saved my life, while I was recuperating from surgery!  I love, love,love their wonton soup and their shrimp appetizer. They're delivery is fast and courteous."}
{"text":"The best chinese in the area. The chow mein is great. The hot and sour soup is to die for. If yiu dont like seafood (like me) you can get the hot and aour soup with only pork which is soooo good. They deliver so fast. They tell you 45 minutes but honestly you have it within 20-30 and it is always hot. I cant say enough about how much i prefer this place to the other chinese in the area. Really dont waste your time somewhere else."}
{"text":"We are from Huntington Beach, California, when we come to Vegas this is one of my stops.  Their food is fresh, great quality meat, vegetables are top grade.  The only problem we have is that we always forget how much food they give you.  If there is a chinese dish you love not on the menu, ask them, they make mine.  I appreciate the servers, cooks, place is always clean.  But the food is FANTASTIC.  We have been trying different dishes for the past year, and have been happy with them, simply can't go wrong.     My little four your old grand daughter, 18 year old twins, my mother and father, everyone loves their food.  You can get dishes mildly spicy, or spicy, be specific because you will get what you ask LOL.   In the same center as HomeDepot and Sally's Beauty."}
{"text":"Just had to deal with one of my pet peeves: Horrible Customer Service. Felt discriminated when I walked into a restaurant and immediately noticed there was no where I could park my stroller to sit down and eat with Emily; The lady at the counter rushed me to give my order and was very rude. I moved furniture around to sit while I waited and saw that they stored all of the high chairs in a corner with boxes stacked on top of them! And they obviously didn't want us to stay when they made our order to-go! UGH. Why did I even bother?!"}
{"text":"Service was friendly, restaurant was clean, and the portion size for the lunch special was great! Many of the Chinese restaurants near by seem bland and underwhelming, not this place! The food was delicious we had generals chicken and tofu with veggies. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I've only ordered online but they're very quick and the food is always hot and delicious. Definitely would recommend his place. The shrimp fried rice is the bomb.com"}
{"text":"Eh- the food was okay. Did not care for the chow mien- tasted like top ramen. The rice was okay after drowned in soy sauce. Honey Walnut Shrimp was decent but not worth paying for."}
{"text":"This place is great for takeout. I usually get the Singapore rice noodles or the fish with black bean sauce. They're both great. Today, I had pad Thai with chicken and I'm sorry to say it was terrible. The chicken was in unappetizing lumps. It looks like dark meat. They're very generous with it, but it was a lot of something I don't like. It didn't taste like pad Thai I've had at other places.   Lesson learned - don't order Thai food from a Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm giving this review 3 stars and I will explain why.  Give them 5 stars for delivery.. Food in 20 minutes deserves nothing less!  The food itself gets 3 stars. We ordered Mongolian beef, which was not cooked as dark as I thought it would be from the picture, but still had great flavor. Also, the beef was a little softer than I expected. We also ordered orange chicken, which wasn't the best either. It was dry and the flavor didn't seem fresh. We each got an order or shrimp fried rice and pork fried rice. The pork was different than what we're used to being from NY. It was a strip of pork rather than the small pieces we get out there, so that was shocking. shrimp fried was great! Shrimp much bigger than the ones in NY. The other issue with the pork fried rice was we asked for no vegetables and there were peas and carrots in it.   Price gets 2 stars. This meal, was $34! That's a lot for Chinese food.  But, for good food who cares! However, this food didn't taste like $34 meal. They charge $5.25 for fried rice. You don't get he option of white or fried. So that was an extraordinary $10.50 just for rice. If it weren't for that, the price would've been fine.   We will likely give them another chance before we decide they're a final no."}
{"text":"We had China One a few days ago,  my kids and myself have no complaints.  The portions were big as we had take out. We had orange chicken, which I never eat.  The kids enjoyed it!  We also had pork chow mein, chicken chop suey and honey walnut shrimp. Appetizers were crab ragoon and pot stickers. It was tasty good."}
{"text":"We eat here using delivery at least weekly. They have the best foot, deliver quickly and the consistency in their food is second ton none. Prefer from them. You'll be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"I used to go in here quite a bit and thought it was pretty good but hadn't gone for awhile.  I was really disappointed.  My chicken chow mien was the flat noodles and extremely dry and sticky.  They were stuck together in one big clump.  It was nasty.    The pork fried rice was mediocre.    Won't be going back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! My boyfriend just moved to Vegas and wanted some Chinese food. We got a flier from China One and decided to put an order for delivery. My boyfriend is very picky with his beef chow fun and once he had it from here, he didn't want to order it from anywhere else! It was delicious, cheap, and huge. Delivery was also quick, about 30 mins. Definitely give this place a call or stop by."}
{"text":"Panda Who????  For Americanized Chinese fast food, the bear has nothing on China One.(At least at this location, anyway) everything is made to order, hot off the wok, and the service is very quick, efficient, and they always check up on you if you needed a thousand more grains of rice, to make sure your meal is what you expected, or even refill your drink for you.  Dining in, they give you bigger portions, and they gave us egg drop soup, spring rolls, and wonton chips for the long wait. We shared the Beef Chow Fun and The Garlic Chicken. Looking for a quick hot meal that's filling? This is not a bad choice at all....ALOHA!!!  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(11/100) \"Better Than the Bear\""}
{"text":"First time here and the workers were SO sweet. Rare to come around exceptional customer service and this place topped that. Checked up on me every few minutes, portions were massive, and the lunch special deals are great! This will definitely be my new lunch spot. Thank you CHINA ONE!"}
{"text":"The location i called & the location i went to were 2 different locations ... thank goodness!  The one i called tried to overcharge me ... this one charged correctly, although it was a pick up order, i felt comfortable placing my order & getting my food from here.  OMG the portion was HUGE & tasty.  Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"This place delivered food to my house from grub hub and within a minute of me opening these boxes was absolutely disgusted. I called immediately and they refused to do anything about it even after grub hub called them. I told them they could come pick up their food because it wasn't even edible. Thanks to grub hub for giving me a credit towards my next meal since this place didn't want to do anything about the chicken skin they served me."}
{"text":"Our family gets delivery or takeout quite regularly from here.  Delivery is always fast. When we call in an order, it is ready within ten minutes. Food is decent not the best I've had, but still quite tasty. We always get pork fried rice and broccoli chicken in oyster sauce is a must for me. Wontons and fried dumplings are pretty good."}
{"text":"I do not know how this place is still in business. We have had food delivered twice and it has been to worst, very poor quality. First time they delivered the wrong meals and the second time the food was bad. The rice was undercooked and the vegetables were not clean (gritty) and very old. Both times we called back and complained and they made it our problem. This is the worst customer services and a poorly managed location. Also they change $3 for delivery."}
{"text":"I do not know how this place is still in business. We have had food delivered twice and it has been to worst quality of food. First time they delivered the wrong meals and the second time the food was bad. The rice was undercooked and the vegetables were not clean (gritty) and very old. Both times we called back and complained and they made it our problem.. This is the worst customer services and I cannot wait until there is a more competition, because they will be out of business. This is poorly managed location. Also they charge and extra $3 for delivery."}
{"text":"Definitely good for date nights. You can get a large amount of food for a good price and even have leftovers! They have a special for dinner for 2 for $25, but honestly you could probably feed 4 people with it for all the food they give you. Their boba is so good too! We had iced mocha and mango, BOMB."}
{"text":"Been here twice since they opened. Service is great. Friendly staff. Like most Chinese restaurants, food are made when ordered but here they are pretty quick. I really like their Sliced BBQ Pork. Portion for that dish was way more than I expected especially for it being an appetizer. Its really tasty and the char sui sauce it's stir fried in reminds of the dish I grew up eating.  Really pleased and will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Always my first choice of Chinese delivery food. Affordable price with tasty legit Chinese food."}
{"text":"I've been there twice now and I've been loving it. Their food is delicious! And their sweet and sour chicken tastes a lot different than other Chinese restaurants, but thats certainly not a bad thing. 10/10 would come again."}
{"text":"Just ok, I would eat from here again, but the choice is about the same as Panda Express.   The portion sizes were huge, but the food wasn't quality.   Also they botched some of our order and the customer service was very underwhelming.   I really don't see where all the four and five star reviews are coming from.   Oh well."}
{"text":"The quality of meat is sub par here.  I ordered egg rolls, crab rangoons, chicken fried rice, salt and pepper chicken and Mongolian beef.  The egg rolls and rangoons were awesome and the other dishes were seasoned great but why does all the meat here look and taste like styrofoam? Really grosses me out I wish there were more options in this area...  The staff was very nice."}
{"text":"Local Chinese haunt!  Good food @ a good price, the staff is very friendly; i visit this place often!  Just wish it was a little cleaner and all food prep was done out of view; sometimes prep is done at one of the customer tables! :("}
{"text":"Disappointed in how the orange chicken was dry. The fried rice and wonton soup wasn't so flavorful but, the chow mein and strawberry boba was good minus some of the tapioca being semi-hard. The sauces minus the sweet and sour were weird. The darker one was essentially soy sauce with red chili flakes and maybe something else.. not too great."}
{"text":"For $5.95 , i got served freshly made dish with fresh vegetable. ( lunch special)  Food quality is excellent."}
{"text":"Called me to say they were out of Boba so they could not fill my order, so I told them to cancel but my card was still charged!"}
{"text":"The service is great  There food is great  There plays is great  They're very clean  Most of different places we went have no soap to clean your hands before you eat. And they do Will come back again soon"}
{"text":"Here in Las Vegas I did some shopping around the city. I  got hunrgy wanted some Chinese food. But I want something close near where I was at. So 0.2 miles from my location I spot this place. I didn't check the review of this place so I didn't know what to expect.  I enter inside a nice small place very clean. I was greeted by a young woman who took my order. She was nice and offer a to go plate so I can eat out of the box if I don't finish my food. I went to the bathroom and 2 minutes later my food was all ready for me.  I ordered the mongolian beef lunch special it came with half chow mien & half plain fried rice,soup & wontons. Took a bite of each item. I gotta say it tastes great. I love the spicy beef the  and peppers the rice is good it just simple rice. Then the chow mien is plain too but I really like the fettuccine noodles. Plus I order a drink it was a big huge cup.  Overall this is a great place to go to have some great Chinese food without spending a lot of money. I would love to come here again to try other items on thier menu."}
{"text":"This place is my go to Chinese delivery. The family deals are good. I have never eaten anything I don't like. The won ton soup is not to be missed. The portions are large and we always have more the next day.  Everything has reheated well. The fried rice that comes with the family meal is delicious. Delivery is fast and they call right away if they have any questions to make sure they are doing as you would like. When I order things like sweet and sour chicken or pork, the breading to meat ratio makes of breaks it for me. They seem to have a good ratio.  I don't believe I have ever found any gristly pieces of meat either, which can be a big turnoff. I also enjoy the Thai iced tea and crab stuffed wontons, the egg rolls are also legit."}
{"text":"we ordered the general chicken and moo goo chicken.  Both are very delicious.  The service is fast and friendly.  Will come back again."}
{"text":"I'm picky but fair..... bland and greasy chicken chow mein (my son even spit it out without any influence), not spicy chicken wings and Mongolian Beef.   The beef was spicy but poor quality meat with lots of grissle (flavor was slightly sweet and I don't like sweet).   Sad because it was Chinese New Year,  the patrons abd staff looked happy.  The establishment appeared clean.  Waste of $24."}
{"text":"Put my order in for delivery. Only to realize that they cancelled my order 30 minutes later with no explanation. No courtesy call, just an email. I call them to ask why, they said their 10 minute drive was too far and it would take 2 hours so I should call their other restaurant that is 7 minutes away. The 1 star is based on customer service solely."}
{"text":"Customer service was pretty bad. No, VERY bad. Not a single person greeted me as I walked in. In fact, I got stares that made me feel unwelcome or like they thought I was going to steal something. I was the only person in line and yet I felt the cashier was still rushing me.  I guess getting back to her text messaging was more important than satisfying her customer.   The food itself is nothing to go crazy for. It's just your average, what-you'd-expect Chinese food. I can honestly say, I'll never having a craving for this stuff.   I received the same unwelcoming stares as I walked out. I even said \"Thank you, bye!\" too. I don't get it. How are they even still in business?"}
{"text":"I am a fan, no more panda express for me, the lunch special is amazing, caution when it says spicy, its SPICY, great service, great portions, and the best part is the whole staff had lunch together,  and they jumped up if customers came in, entire menu very reasonably priced and the shrimps are huge!!! Come and give them a try, they are very appreciative of your business and u will be back whether its for lunch special or full service dinner, they cater as well..."}
{"text":"Friendly service. We tried the veggie egg rolls, wonton soup, sweet & sour chicken with fried rice ILO steamed white rice. Ok, everyone was friendly but definitely a communication issue because we asked for fried ILO white rice. We were told $3 charge. No problem. Then our food comes without the rice & the guy says I'll bring you white rice. I let him know we ask for fried instead. He then asked if we meant house fried rice. Not knowing there's more than 1 fried rice, my husband said yes. After we eat & yes, all the food was GREAT, our bill showed a $6.95 charge for fried rice! I tell the guy & he says \"your husband said yes to house\". I let him know that's be because we had no idea there's different types & I explained how the order was placed. He corrected the amount charged. So, a bit of a communication issue, but we will definitely go back as the food was really good & everyone was very service oriented!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I've tried several Chinese food places in Vegas and this area of summerlin has very few good ones. I ordered the king pao shrimp and it was just perfect not all drippy saucy with that same sauce that they always put in Chinese food. The shrimp was huge and flavorful and slightly ever so slightly battered. The vegetables were cooked perfect not overdone not raw . I even asked them to toast some of the red dried Chile's on the side for me because I like it spicy and they cooked those perfect too. FINALLY we have a place that's close to home that's worthy. Great service and great location .prices are good big portions . They deliver too."}
{"text":"What a great lunch food was amazing priced right love the atmosphere very friendly and fun upbeat music. Our service was great definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Looks like a normal takeout but doesn't taste like one. We randomly went in the service was quick, food was fresh unlike usual take out places, and the prices were very reasonable. Must try their Taro Bubble Tea.  Their eggplant is amazing and so is the Kung Pao chicken! Their food does taste fresh.  Highly recommend if you don't want anything fancy but quick and in budget."}
{"text":"if your from the New York Metropolitan area, and now you live here in Las Vegas, you probably know the chinese food here SUCKS, but this place is actually real good,  The toughest thing i find is getting good pork fried rice, but their's is real good, everything is good here, so give it a try!!!!"}
{"text":"Great tasting Chinese food at a reasonable price. Place was clean and service was quick and friendly. Will definitely return the next time I'm in town"}
{"text":"Listen, this ain't authentic Chinese cuisine. Very much modified to leverage our western palates.  Nothing wrong with that!  Tasty fare.  Fantastic prices.  Good service.  Certainly the best casual Chinese joint in Centennial Hills.  Plus, meaty chicken fried rice!"}
{"text":"Very friendly hostess/waitress! We came in today for their lunch, and they gave us egg rolls on the house. The food was delicious, and the hostess/waitress was so attentive and friendly. I'm leaving this 5 star review for both the kind hostess and the yummy food. We're so glad we stopped by!"}
{"text":"Worst place to deal with EVER!!! We placed an order worth  $40.00 which included honey shrimp, mongolian beef and sweet and sour pork. Food came and the pork came with no sauce. I called to let them know they forgot the sauce lady on the phone became hostile and finally said she would call driver and have him bring some, which is no problem since the restaurant is about 5 or 10 mins away. We waited 40 mins and still nothing. I called back and spoke to this lady again, this time very rude and super hostile. I told her our food is now cold. She told me to just eat it cold, she will not do anything to make up for their mistake, we stuck with it. I told her that it was it, she is not going to continue to be rude and yell at a paying customer,  I want a refund. She said no way, but it was either make me fresh food or refund me. Either way she was getting this crappy cold food back. I mean cmon, this was their mistake, just fix it.  The driver finally showed up, I got food back together,  gave it to him and had him refund me my money.  China One will NEVER get my hard earned money again. I mean Chinese food is not cheap, I expect to get what I ordered and treated with a little respect for the money shelled out for that food..."}
{"text":"The salt & pepper chicken wings are awesome. Only thing I come here for. So freakin good. Order it, and thank me later."}
{"text":"I was always certain about Chinese food until I ordered from here. I am going to admit that I'm a picky eater, I don't like steamed chicken, just ew. And in the menu section is doesn't specify that the chicken is steamed. Once I order I was experience GRILLED chicken and ended up with a 10$ trash waste. My boyfriend thought the wonton soup was delicious the first time He tried it, but the second time it was a bit too soggy. The breaded lemon chicken was ok. Tasted kinda like fish which I didn't like because I hates seafood. The rice was way to dry for he liking as well; the vegetable rolls were just straight up disgusting. Overall it was ok. But not the best."}
{"text":"It is your typical fast Chinese food.  Nothing special. Adequate   The portion are ample for sharing but the sodium is always high even when requesting low sodium.  Some how it does not register.  After eating here sometimes you will want to drink a gallon of water.   The last time I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps that I requested low sodium. But within an hour I was drinking water like my life depended on it and I eventually woke up with a massive headache.  Not good. If you want reasonable priced fast Chinese this is a decent selection. If you are looking for quality choose wisely."}
{"text":"DH and I went there tonight.  We were blown away by the flavors, freshness and friendly service.  Veggie fried rice, teriyaki chicken served over perfect veggies with great sauce, orange chicken and fried wontons.  Yes, we order a lot because we are used to that \"American chinese food place\".... but for the same price we got so much more at China One.  Thanks guys!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars than I would. I called for pick up and the lady gave me the worst customer service. I thought I'd give this place a try, but after the rude service I'm glad I didn't even go to there establishment. My review is solely on customer service."}
{"text":"Came to Las Vegas on vacation with the fam and wanted to eat the best of the everything out here. My husband and I look for restaurants with 4/5 stars that where $ to $$ at price point range and everything that had 4/5 were closed on Sunday. China One was in the area and open so we checked it out. First thing I noticed was no apparent smell of delicious cooking food ingulfing the surrounding parking area or worse nothing inside the restaurant either never the less we stayed ordered bbq pork it was smothered in sauce and looked little appetizing, but to my surprise it was tasty i gave it a 3.5. We also ordered Orange chicken which was also tasty i gave it a 4. We ordered house special chow mein and house fried rice they both were a 3.5 tasty but could use a bit more flavor. You would have to smother it in sweet and sour sauce, soy sauce, hot mustard which they don't have, or chilli sauce  It was edible and did the job for the moment but it's a pass only visit if others are closed."}
{"text":"This is my go to neighborhood Chinese spot. The food is yummy and the prices for lunch can't be beat. Their Chicken in Hot Garlic Sauce lunch special is $6.55 and the portions are plenty big. They never give me a problem when I have my special requests either. They deliver as well!   They have boba, with different premixed slushes and the milk tea isn't the worst I've ever had. I also really like the crab rangoons! They usually have an ad they send out in the mail (just in my junk mail pile) with different coupons too, so keep an eye out!  Out of all of the Chinese restaurants that deliver to my house, this is my favorite."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from my mom! Couldn't wait to try! This place is outstanding! Authentic Chinese food! Large portions and extremely kind staff. So glad it's close by! My new go to spot!!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Fried rice is very good. Try the spicy pad thai noodles. Listed as Pad Thai shrimp in the attached picture, but it is so much more. It has chicken, shrimp, and is delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food and delivered very quick. I have missed good Chinese food. China one is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"After shopping at Ross, we decided to stop by China One to order three items to go fpr dinner. We ordered chicken fried rice, seafood chow mein and salt and pepper chickens. They are pretty generous with their condiments but not the food. The salt and pepper chickens was crispy but tasted old. The chicken tasted like it has been marinated for more than a couple of days before it was brought out to fry.The seafood chow mein tasty but greasy. The chicken fired rice was on the crunchy side as though the rice didn't cook well.   The restaurant smells and looks good on the outside, however we will not be visiting this place again."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and good food. Cant complain. Its clean and much more inviting than its prior Diamond China. Though I was a long time customer of DC this is a nice change."}
{"text":"You are always greeted with a smile and hello when you enter the restaurant.  The service is quick and efficient.  And the food is solid.  Not the best of all time Chinese food but somewhere between good and great."}
{"text":"Tried to order online, spent all kinds of time entering my info, and then picking the items for my family's order, only to find out that their super lame ordering system had been deleting each item I added to the cart. What a waste of time. They lost my business."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place for take out Chinese food. They are quick and very reasonably priced. We usually order the Canton Dinner which includes two soups of our choice, two egg rolls, two crab rangoons, two entrees (there is a list you pick from) and a BBQ fried rice for $23.95. Its a great deal and its only my boyfriend and I, so we will have left overs for almost 3 days. They also have good priced lunch specials, I would say the only thing I dont like is they dont have separate dinner specials besides the combo dinners. I encourage everyone to try China One."}
{"text":"I don't mean to draw upon comparisons but...Well, yes actually I do.  How could I not compare China One to the former tenant of this location, Diamond China?  I was very fond of Diamond China and I am sad to see it gone.  The food, the family atmosphere, the quiet casual dining room.  All gone.  China One has remodled and the charm is no more.  This now looks like every other Chinese place out there from China A-Go-Go to China Joes.  It is modern.  It is open and noisy because of it.  There is no buffer zone between the dining room and the kitchen any more.  That being said, the food is actually good.  After I had been in the retaurant for a few minutes and was waiting for my order I was brought some fried noodles and a sauce for dipping.  I'm not sure it was a sweet and sour sauce.  Maybe a plum sauce.  Or some sort of citrus.  It was good whatever it was.  I only wish there was more.  There was such a small amount of sauce in the already tiny cup that I could hardly dip my noodles.  I ended up pouring the sauce over the noodles and eating them that way.  I ordered my usual dish of chow fun noodles.  Here there aren't many chow fun options to choose from.  Like two options to be exact.  I ordered the House Chow Fun which is just another generic way of saying Combination Chow Fun.  It came with beef, chicken and shrimp (hold the shrimp).  They kept is simple after that.  Bean sprouts, green onion, purple onion and shredded carrots.  This is chow fun the way I know it to be and the way I like it to be.  It had good flavor without being too salty.  It was cooked perfectly without becoming oily.  The vegetables were fresh and crisp.  It was a solid presentation and more than enough to satisfy even my intense cravings.  It was also priced to the average of what I get elsewhere.  I really have no complaints with the dish.  The service in here isn't especially lacking but it almost seems disjointed. There are two ladies working the dining room and the counter.  Both came to my table.  Both brought me either water or food.  One brought my check the other picked it up.  There was never a long delay waiting for anything but they could have been more consistent.  I understand they are new and maybe they will improve.  All in all, this is a good place for take out.  To dine in just seems pointless."}
{"text":"I really like their chicken teriyaki bowls.  They are very tasty, and when I come in and order, it is very quick.  Wash that down with a thai ice tea (no boba), and it's been a great lunch.  thank you."}
{"text":"I've ordered take out here a few times; always the Spicy Chicken Wings & Crab Rangoon. The food is ok but not worth the recent price increase. I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"First experience with restaurant - very good! Placed a takeout order - ready quickly and accurate. Favorite was the crab rangoon, spring rolls and orange chicken. Will return!"}
{"text":"No food grade?! When we asked where the food grade was they \"didn't know what we were talking about\" idk about all that!"}
{"text":"So, this isn't even worth rating.  First time there, ordered from the menu on the wall, which simply says Pad Thai Noodle spicy.  No mention of shrimp.  I asked that tofu be added, like I've done at other establishments.  I get all the way to work, there's shrimp in my order, I return to the restaurant, explain that I'm allergic.   Asked if it comes without shrimp.  It does not.  Well that info was in the hand menu, not on the wall.  Understandable.  I'm new.  I'm good until the owner proceeds to tell me, \"you have to tell us\", that \"I have to READ the details\".  Then he says he can \"pick\" out the shrimp.  Do u understand, I CAN'T pick out the shrimp.  I will DIE.  He snatches my order, is visibly angry...this man isn't fixing any food for me.  I asked for my money back, reminded him that I was looking to be a return customer....but yeah not returning this location or any other....."}
{"text":"It's pretty good. I'd actually say the food itself is good/average 3-star Chinese food but the service & value makes it 4 stars. Dining in, the restaurant is clean and the servers polite and prompt. We usually get delivery though, and it is FAST - 25 minutes after we ordered fast! If you live nearby and get their ad in the mail, take advantage of their \"Happy Family\" coupon. It's so much food for $29.95! Lunches are cheap too."}
{"text":"Cheese wontons are wonderful. Fast delivery."}
{"text":"Visited restaurant on a whim and pleasantly surprised with phenomenal customer service quality of our meal portion sizes are very generous will come back with the family this restaurant though being small rivals the big chain  Chinese restaurants will be coming back to enjoy delicious dinners"}
{"text":"We got delivery last week and wow was it good!! Still yummy as ever!! We go there like once or 2wice a week!!   I'm actually going to order tonight, but this time I may venture out of my comfort zone and try something new!"}
{"text":"I come here often for dinner, The food is good most of the time, the service here is ehh, it took them a long time to complete and serve my order, we sat down and waited, with a full staff standing around some sitting down eating, only two other guests in the restaurant. I can understand if it was very busy night but to me it seemed like they had forgotten about us. This visit was my last visit. I was very bothered when i recieved the check. The amount was fair, it  (was the amount of what we had purchased but what caught my eye was that the TIP amount was circled. I always leave tip where ever i go as a courtesy to the staff, good job! But when its put in your face as to dont forget to tip it really did bother me. I felt it was unnecessary and rude to be asking for it. I had given the waitress my credit card along with the check and the 1st thing she checks is if i had left a tip amount (which i didn't)so she asks me \"what.. No tip? Are u going to leave cash?\"Her speaking in a foreign language to another staff member and looking at me waiting for an answer, i said yeah I'll leave cash. I never realized how desperate they were for tip. I said thank you have a nice night while leaving the table, they jumped up and staring at the table searching for a tip. I had left no tip and you had just lost a big eating customer."}
{"text":"It's greasy Chinese food, but it's still pretty good. I ordered the family deal. It was three entrees, fried rice, white rice, egg rolls, and cream cheese ragoons and was content. Also ordered the taro slush. It's not real fruit like they advertise, but the powder flavor is good too!   Only thing wrong I suppose I have to say  was they accidentally gave our food to the wrong person. It's ok, mistakes happen."}
{"text":"This place is great. Nice service and good food.Must try the House fried rice and spicy chicken wings!!love it!!"}
{"text":"Picked up two small boba and taro smoothies and a Thai iced tea on the way to the game store next door. All three came out to less than $10. Pretty solid.   The eatery also offered mango or strawberry smoothies.  I didn't try any of the food, but the drinks were good for north Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Wanted to add an update to China one. Went in on Friday night to eat dinner, our two and a half year old grandson was with us, and was a little rambunctious,. We ended up walking out. We have never been treated so rudely. The lady seated us, and treated  us so rude rude. She seemed so angry that our grandson was a little hyper. Definitely not a family oriented restaurant to eat at. They acted as though we were disturbing their whole three tables of customers that were sitting there eating at the time. Will definitely find it hard to go back. Customer service was horrible. She was so focused on our grandson, whom calmed down within the first 5 minutes of being seated, that she couldn't even offer us what was on the menu. I hope she wasn't the owner or the manager because this kind of customer service was just unacceptable! I had to wonder if she hated children?"}
{"text":"I don't know About too many dishes there but I get the chicken w curry and ham fried rice and boy is it delicious...not sure about the other food though"}
{"text":"The food was terrible. The Hong Kong beef, chicken and shrimp with chow mein didn't come with meat or vegetables. It was dry burnt ramen noodles. Inedible. Astonished at how bad this was. Will never go back"}
{"text":"The potstickers and their sauce are straight heavenly here. Bbq pork fried rice is delish. Chicken chow mein yummy,  egg drop soup great,  and orange chicken nom, nom."}
{"text":"We ordered food from China One about 3 weeks ago and had it delivered. It was delivered to my house within the time specified. We ordered sweet and sour chicken for the kids and shrimp with lobster sauce for the adults. The sweet and sour tasted old, which was really disappointing. The fried rice was delicious, though, as was the shrimp. Even though the chicken was old, I'd be willing to try this restaurant again."}
{"text":"I come here for lunch frequently.  Chicken with hot garlic sauce is my favorite. The staff is always very friendly and the food is delicious.  The prices are good and they delivery if you want to stay home. One of my favorite lunch spots."}
{"text":"The food just didn't have flavor.. we got chicken chow mein & orange chicken. It definitely tasted like they just pulled it out of the freezer and heated it up. It just didn't taste fresh. We've had better chinese at panda express..unfortunately."}
{"text":"So i USED TO BE a frequent customer and I loved this place but god forbid they charge you for the dinner meal instead of the lunch special. I had an order for 30 dollars to be delivered. When it arrived it was not what I ordered and I called back to ask them if they would replace it but the OWNER said I would have to drive all the way to the restaurant to replace it. I said I couldn't...hence the delivery. So now I'm sitting here with the wrong food and she wouldn't replace it even though it's the owners mistake. DONT SUPPORT THIS ESTABLISHMENT. THANK YOU"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. I really liked the fried rice and the spring rolls. My family got the chicken and broccoli but were less impressed. The delivery time was really long for how close it is to my house. I think it took about an hour and it is basically around the corner. Overall, it was good. Will I be back? Probably when I am too lazy to go out and until I find another Chinese food spot near my house that is better. So far, it is better than Asian Wok which is also in the Centennial Hills area."}
{"text":"Salt and pepper wings are thick and juicy. Fried rice perfect. Srimp snow pea perfect. Good slushy.  Kind staff.  Clean restaurant.   Fast. Crappy parking."}
{"text":"I just ordered take out from China One and it is delicious! I can't stop eating it eve though I am full! I got Singapore noodles combination and double cooked pork! Fabulous!!!"}
{"text":"Order delivery and their service was really fast. Arrived in about 20-25 mins. Ordered orange chicken, salt & pepper pork chop and a special/house fried rice. The orange chicken was good but the salt & pepper pork chop was ok, it lacked flavor. It is supposed to be spicy (we specifically requested it to be on the spicy side but it tasted like a breaded pork chop only, no flavor of any kind). I'm giving them 4 stars and not 3 because their house fried rice was delicious and the portion was huge. Overall, is good but not great."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!  Previously we had dined at the S. Rainbow location and loved it but recently moved to the Centennial Hills area so the N. Durango location is closest to us now.  Food was excellent and the staff was very friendly! Best Chinese food in Vegas! They are always busy, so that tells you something!  Great food!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food we have had since moving to Las Vegas over a year ago! Food was fresh & delicious! Staff was super friendly! Would definitely go back and would recommend!"}
{"text":"The food is great but my issue is their service. I used to go here a lot and always ordered party trays from them every time I had parties or gatherings, but I am done with them. So one day I ordered the usual delivery (it was hard for me at the time to pick up food while at home pregnant and 2 tiny kids). I ordered online and prepaid with the 15% tip already included. Delivery showed up and he forgot my boba drink and says he will come back with it. In about 30mins, he never came back (I literally live 5 mins away) and when I ask if he's coming in told \"we ran out of boba\". It was at least 5 hours until closing so I find this hard to believe... So I said ok can I get a refund? He said he can come tomorrow and I said fine even though I wanted it today. So the next day I follow up and ask if they're coming to drop off my drink from yesterday and the driver didn't wanna leave come just to drop off a drink and that they're too busy. So I had to go pick up the drink even though it was part of my paid order from yesterday. I could've easily let it go but just the principle of getting what I paid for is why I kept insisting. I'm not satisfied with this result. All I got was a short \"sorry\" and the drink I picked up. They have lost my loyal business..."}
{"text":"I seriously love this little joint! The chicken teriyaki is so good and they are a really fresh so you can omit ingredients as you prefer. The waitresses are always super friendly and helpful and the cooks look clean and professional which is always a good sign. It's a quaint little shop nestled in the shopping complex and when you walk in its going to surprise you of how much sitting space is actually in the store. They even have decent music playing at just the right volume so you can enjoy it without being annoyed or hold a conversation on a date night. The food isn't the best I have ever tasted but it is pretty tasty and definitely worth the prices which are super cheap for the portions you receive. Give this place a shot you will love it I promise."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from China One for the first-time last night. Delivery came without a problem within an hour. Unfortunately, the food was very disappointing. Pretty tasteless, bland and without spice although both items, Mongolian Beef and Pork in Hot Garlic Sauce were listed as spicy on the menu. In any case, two stars at best. I won't be ordering again."}
{"text":"This is our go to place for Chinese food. It's always fast and good. My husband loves the chicken teriyaki bowl and I choose the honey walnut shrimp. It's always hot and yummy. The portion tonight was smaller than usual. It still tasted great, but hopefully they haven't decreased the portions. The employees are friendly also."}
{"text":"Is this the best Chinese in town? No, but it is the best anywhere near 95 and Durango. It is well priced, service is always fast and friendly, and food is tasty. The Mongolian beef is better then most, and the kids really like the Mongolian chicken. Have ordered dine in, pick up, and delivery and food and service always consistently good"}
{"text":"I order from here often. More so because it's close and the minimum is only $10 which you cannot beat especially when their lunch special runs until 4pm. Quick delivery, I order the cashew chicken only with a Taro bubble tea. Although I order at least once every month  I do feel there are better tasting Chinese food else where. Doesn't take away from the pros I feel are worth it if you have no transportation."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start. I ordered the house fried rice and was told it would be here \"soon\", after waiting more than an hour I decide to go outside my office to see if maybe the delivery driver got lost. Sure enough, there he was stating \"here's your food\", passing it to me, then promptly leaving. I looked down at the tiny box he had handed me and wondered what my $12 had actually gotten me. Not much. I had about 2 pieces of shrimp, a ton of egg and something that looked like pork (even though it's advertised to only include shrimp,  beef ribs, and chicken). It was tasteless, room temperature and really greasy. I tried adding soy sauce for flavor but that did not help. About halfway through my 3rd bite I began to feel sick and decided to save myself the trip to the emergency room--I threw this \"food\" away. Will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"Awesomely cheap Chinese food restaurant in Las Vegas. They have lunch and dinner specials with fried rice or chowmein noddles. They also offer family dinner specials for 25 to 27 dollars. Will definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Try the chicken wraps appetizer. Our third visit and still not one complaint.  Not a fan of sushi but it sure looks great. Clean and courteous service. Much better than most of the Chinese restaurants in the North Hills.  If you like Chinese food give it a try."}
{"text":"Recently moved to Vegas and have been searching for an acceptable Chinese restaurant. Found this via Yelp and it has been exceptional! Make sure you use the Craig location, the Durango one sucks...  We try different dishes each time and everything has been great. The only downside I've discovered so far is they use the iconic Chinese food folding box for most entrees instead of the styrofoam containers, and it causes food near the bottom to go soggy if you don't remove it from the box quickly."}
{"text":"Okay. This place has good food so I feel bad about the 1 star but the customer service of this place is TERRIBLE. We used to order here all the time it would take maybe 20 minutes for delivery ( we work .4 miles away) and now they take over an hour and a half. They get your order wrong and the lady on the phone doesn't understand a word you say it's so frustrating. The food isn't worth the wait or bad service, sorry"}
{"text":"The service was great.  We did take out only waited about 10 minutes for food.  The food was tasty and hot.  We had orange chicken ams Mongolian beef with pork fried rice Everything was so fresh and delicious we will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but so far, so good. The lunch special comes with chow mein, rice (steamed or fried), and egg drop soup. I had the honey walnut shrimp, which normally isn't offered as a lunch special item at other Chinese restaurants. It was the priciest of the lunch special items, but that's perfectly fine with me.  Serving size was ample for the price. The food was good. Nothing noteworthy taste wise that I can recall, but at the end of the day, it was a solid Chinese lunch special. I'll come here again."}
{"text":"\"What do you want for dinner?\" \"I don't know, what do you want for dinner?\"  We have this conversation often. I realized tonight we hadn't had Chinese food since we moved into this house over a year ago.      We got beef and broccoli, vegetable egg fu young, mushu pork, egg rolls, lemon chicken, and wanton soup. They delivered SUPER FAST. Everything was hot and fresh and tasty. Our delivery guy was really nice, our order was all correct. We will definitely be repeat customers here."}
{"text":"Really, I can't come up with anything better than \"adequate\" to describe this place.  Maybe there isn't great Chinese food in town anymore, or maybe I haven't found it.  Their delivery is pretty consistent and courteous."}
{"text":"Located next to Ross in the shopping center by charleston and rainbow.  Panda Express just lost a customer haha this place smells yummy and tastes even better!!! No fancy sir down place but the food speaks for itself. Generous amounts of food and speedy service.  Girls are very nice. Kitchen clean.  Had the dinner meal for 24 dollars comes with 2 entree plates, 2 egg rolls, 2 crab ragoons, fried rice and egg drop soup.  All good wasn't too crazy about the egg rolls but the rest made up for that.  Will def be coming again.  Oh and they have awesome lunch specials until 4"}
{"text":"Excellent chinese food and service. Went here with my cousins after a mt.charleston trip- apparently my cousins are regulars and were greeted warmly. We had their lunch specials and chicken/beef bowls. I grew up eating panda express and this is ten times better, and fresher. Their veggies were nice and crisp: zuchinnis, carrots and broccoli. Yum. Their chicken was ok but I was in love with their beef. It wasnt too chewy and cooked just right with a mice balance of salty and savoriness. The meal concluded nicely with fortune cookies. My favorite was my uncle's fortune: 'you are pretty'."}
{"text":"(See my review for Ho Ho Ho for why I am rating it a 4)  This place for me was 'Number 2' in terms of my Chinese go-to places here in Las Vegas.  For a long time, the be-all end-all for me with Chinese food was always Ho Ho Ho.  Then in 2011, I tried China One and I am glad I did!  I really enjoyed their options that came with main courses! Their egg drop soup was not too thick or heavy, their service was prompt, and they had delicious General Tso's chicken which is my number one favorite!  A few years ago, they opened up a restaurant just down the road from where I live on Durango and I'm constantly ordering via Eat 24.  Back when I used to work an early shift of 5 AM-2 PM, I'd go here for lunch, it was a perfect feeling to sink my teeth into some Chinese after an exhausting work day!  Their Sesame Chicken is another dish I'm always ordering and they are always good at making it to my specifications (no veggies).  Again, I know there's more options than what I normally get, but really, when you know exactly what you want, what's the harm in sticking to tradition?"}
{"text":"Visiting from California we came off the strip to visit a pet store nearby and decided to grab a bite to eat. Decided on the lunch special. Great food and great prices! Will return on our future trips to Vegas!!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for 25+ years. I have tried many places but no other touches China One. Everything is good. The general tso's is my go to meal but you won't go wrong trying something else. Good portion size, always hot & fresh. But they only take cash."}
{"text":"Stopped by to get lunch today. Ordered  Combination Chow Fun and Wonton Soup. On the menu, the wonton soup has shrimp in it. I am allergic and told the guy behind the counter. I get my food home and notice a shrimp in the wonton soup. I go back and present my food which they gladly remake. I get home again and start eating. Halfway thru the wonton soup, guess what I find? Another Shrimp! Now I'm angry and disappointed. The blatant disregard is something INEXCUSABLE. This could have literally killed me. I will not be back due to their inability to execute a simple dish twice and potentially making me sick beyond belief. I hope the owners see my post and realize you can't disregard food allergies and  expect repeat business."}
{"text":"Usually we have a great experience with the food at this place. Good quality, nice quantity but today that was NOT THE CASE! I ordered 3 lunch specials for the guys at my office and all of the were wrong! First, and I would say was the worst of them all was the sweet and sour chicken. When you think sweet and sour chicken you think breaded deliciousness in a tangy sweet and sour sauce. You do not think of lukewarm breaded chicken that is bone dry. Can you guess which one I received today? Secondly was the Mongolian beef, normally a go to for me, today had very little heat and no beef. 90% to 10% was the ratio of meat to bell peppers. I didn't order Mongolian bell peppers. I ordered Mongolian beef. Finally General's Chicken, which was the final plate, was criminally dry. This General deserves to be drawn and quartered for this poor excuse of a dish. The only saving grace for this whole order and what made me not send my assistant back to get this fixed was the delicious wings. Good thing we ordered 2 orders of them. There is a Chinese place NEXT DOOR TO MY OFFICE yet I still ordered from this place. I will not be doing so in the future."}
{"text":"I wasn't feeling well and decided to order in for the first time at this location from the crib.   I ordered for the crib:   Shrimp Fried Rice - it was mediocre. Where was the shrimp? 4 pieces?  General Chicken - where was the chicken? It was all batter. I really enjoyed the flavor and the spicy part. But, it was all batter and soggy. (Reason for the two stars)   Wonton Soup - I asked for less salt and they did that. (Reason for the two stars) but, where is the meat in the wonton?   Mushu Chicken - by far the worse Mushu Chicken I have ever had. This is a simple dish. The cabbage didn't taste fresh. Also again, where is the chicken? They said they use white meat which would be chicken breast, but, the chicken didn't look fresh.   I will not give them another try when I'm at the Vegas spot. This was actually a sad experience. One of the worse Chinese I have tried. Twi Stars also because they delivered in 55 min."}
{"text":"I do NOT like writing bad reviews, but I just can't get around it. I've never had such bad Chinese food. My lemon chicken was just fried chicken cutlet that came with a container of what I can only assume was lemon dish soap. Also got orange chicken, which was dry and flavorless. The bottom of the container was filled with funky tasting broccoli. Highlight of the meal was the white rice. Never again."}
{"text":"Mavis thank you for being wonderful and great with my family and I. Every single time I come here or order by online everything goes well and absolute perfect.   delicious food just made right- your soul will say thank you. family friendly environment and also great music toons when you dine inside. When you settle right in you are greeted  warmly and appetizer come right in the table. your food meal is served fast and delicious."}
{"text":"Not bad for a chain Chinese takeout establishment.  Nothing special, but decent food that seems fresh and has some flavor.  I've never had an issue with their quality and it is usually ready close to when they estimate.  Occasionally you will even sense some heat when you ask for extra spicy."}
{"text":"This place dose not mess around when it comes to delivery. Ever time we order its insanely fast , like how did they do that fast. We ordered food at 450 and its at our door by 505 and we dint live around the corner.   We always call in our orders , have never used the online ordering system. Over the phone they are easy to understand and communicate with in like some other Chinese restaurants.   The food, its good not life changing but good. We normally get 2 or 3 entrees . I really like the chicken fried rice , the wife likes the beef and broccoli. The orange chicken is also quite good. The size for money is ok we normally spend 40 and get enough for 3 people and a bit of leftovers.   So all in all its ok, not life changing, best part is the speed of delivery."}
{"text":"This is an awesome Chinese restaurant in the Centennial Hills area. This place has a lot going for it:  1. It is in an excellent location 2. The staff is really friendly 3. They deliver 4. The food is very inexpensive 5. Most importantly, the food is excellent  That's all you really need to know when looking for a place to eat. They have a number of dishes and you will always find something that will hit the spot. My friends and I order and go into this place all the time and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"I ordered Chicken Lo Mein and it was quite tasty though a little on the greasy side. It was sort of expensive for how much food I received. I know there are cheaper Chinese places nearby so I probably won't be swinging in again."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese food place for delivery! Fast and delicious for the price. Lots of portions. I especially like their Sesame beef and Hong Kong style pan fried noodles."}
{"text":"China One is a decent stop for your Chinese fix.  In all honesty, there's really nothing outstanding about this place.  It's your typical run-of-the-mill American Chinese food.  If you have the time, Chinese BBQ and Noodle downtown is MUCH better (as are most places on Spring Mountain), but China One is the best Chinese in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place because it delivers to my new home here in Vegas but I didn't :( my kids didn't even like the food and they love everything!!! Food was super bland no flavor. Delivery driver was fast and super nice but food quality or flavor just wasn't there."}
{"text":"In a city with hundreds of Chinese restaurants, China One stands out. The food was delivered quickly and the quality was excellent. The Family Dinner is a great value and everything was delicious. I wish there were more entree options for the family dinners and that they had pot stickers and egg rolls with pork instead of chicken and veggies respectively, but these are small concerns considering the quality of the rest of the food.  We will definitely be ordering here again."}
{"text":"Good Chinese take out!  Fresh veggies and shrimp.  Shrimp quality can say a lot and these were firm and fresh.  Always ready when I get there, they hustle!"}
{"text":"I was craving Chinese food and decided to give this place a go. It was close and I'm inpatient when hungry. It was ok. Not sure if would go vack. The hot and sour soup had shrimp and imitation crab meat. Never seen that before and hopefully never will again. Where's the pork? That would make it a proper HSS. I also ordered house fried rice. No complaints there. Also Tuesday pot stickers were decent. That's about it. I'm ready for dinner now...."}
{"text":"What a shame. I assume they're under new management? This place used to be one of my favorite Chinese food places but their quality has gone downhill in recent months. Our delivery came two hours late back in December, then our meals would have had too much oil or missing spices, and most recently my husband's shrimp fried rice had a ton of what looked like crab shells! We had to throw it out."}
{"text":"Don't believe that one person w the two star review. This place you def wanna try. Food was quick, hot and tasty. What more do you want? The beef and broccoli had a lot of beef in it and had great flavor. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"China One major delish!!! Got to have their house fried rice THE BEST!!  Every dish we've had is so delicious!!"}
{"text":"First time and it totally came thru. Big portions and good service. Food was amazing, we'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Great flavor. So much food I was able to eat it for 3 meals. Well worth every dollar spent."}
{"text":"They are fast, the food is made fresh, it's not expensive, and they so nice there. I love the fact that the food tastes the same every time, and is fresh and hot. The Honey Cashew Shrimp is to die for. The String Beans are an excellent side dish, too. They recently stopped serving Almond Cookies.  It isn't expensive and sometimes they randomly toss in a free item. YAY!   They don't have Almond Cookies anymore, sadness."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch. Great service. Well above average food too. If I'm in the area, I will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"New to the neighborhood. Need a Chinese delivery place. This place shows some promise. Pot stickers were fried. I prefer the traditional steamed. They were tasty though. Next time I'll see if they will steam them For me. The beef and brocolli is very good. Lots of tender beef and bright green and crunchy brocolli. Not weighed down with other fillers. A little garlic onion and green pepper and that's about it. Another plus, wait for it. They have duck sauce (although the mustard is weak and in packets. Haven't seen duck sauce since I moved from NJ about 11 years ago. I'll be back to explore the menu a bit"}
{"text":"I've been getting takeout for a bit here now and the overall is good. There are some misses too like with any place with a big menu but if you just want fast made to order  takeout this is the best on in the Centennial area. It's Americanized Chinese, Cantonese food. They're pretty accommodating about various requests too if you're trying to eat a certain way. Also, they deliver if you don't want to leave the house.  I figured I'd give a rundown of what I've liked and didn't like.   First, the lunch specials are a good deal $6.25 meats - $6.95 for seafood (until 4pm daily). They really stuff the box with a entree and fried or steamed rice or chow mein (or half and half) and you get egg drop soup dining in. A la carte items come stuffed as well and pretty reasonable for most $7-10 for a portion one person will usually have trouble finishing.   Eggplant and tofu - probably my favorite thing. I just like their sauce and if you have leftovers the tofu just absorbs more flavor so reheating could even taste better. I know some people don't like the soft, mildly slime factor of eggplant. Then get the tofu and vegetables and replace the brown sauce with the szechuan sauce that normally comes with eggplant and tofu.  General Tso- sometimes I just want something Americanized and I like the pineapples and veggies mixed in theirs. It does have the typical fried breading though you can see if you like if with just sliced chicken. This is janky guilty pleasure type stuff and not something I order a lot.  Chicken w/ black bean sauce-pretty good, bit more Canto than Americanized out of their offerings. I love black bean anything though. Pork with string beans in black bean sauce. I think I prefer this only slightly, but I love green beans.   Shrimp in Lobster Sauce- pretty decent and plump shrimp and they tend to cook it right here, never had a shrimp thing be overcooked or gross.  Kung Pao chicken/shrimp - pretty decent here as well, lots of fresh veggies. I order it extra spicy which they add more dried chilies and sliced green peppers in it.   I'm also a fan of their House fried rice being LOADED with meats and goodies in it.   My big disappointment was their ma po was rather bland and that's normally one of my favorite take-out dishes.  I thought their Honey Walnut Shrimp was too mayo heavy. I didn't like their mongolian beef but I think its the matter of me not being a fan of that style. Their chow mein is too soft/sticky for my taste so I never get it on my lunch combos."}
{"text":"China One really hit the spot when I was craving Chinese food! Good food, large portions, reasonably priced, and super quick delivery (less than 30 minutes). I will definitely be ordering from China One again in the future."}
{"text":"They absolutely have the best tofu and fried rice I've ever had.. fast delivery very good staff amazing boba's and just all around a very good restaurant does it matter which established when you go to China One is always the best"}
{"text":"We ordered the chicken wings as an appetizer. They were cooked perfectly and were very good.  My husband got the Chicken Chow Mein and did not enjoy it at all. He said the noodles were \"off\" and they did not taste good.  I ordered the General Chicken. It was okay. I felt like the chicken was really mushy. It was not cooked well.   The estimated delivery time was 30-40 minutes but it took about 70 minutes. I'm not sure if we will be ordering again."}
{"text":"It's fast food, so the quality is only going to get you so far, but nonetheless, the service is always great here.  Usually if I place an order for delivery, it arrives before the said time frame and the food is hot. I usually get the Mao Po tofu entree and they have yet to disappoint."}
{"text":"Came here on July 25, 2017 around 2 pm. I ordered the Kung Pao combination lunch special w/o beef but she brought me the dinner portion instead I told her that's not right I even pointed at the menu that I wanted the lunch special. She shld know most ppl when they dine-in wld almost always order the lunch special or she could have asked me too instead she gave a little attitude but brought me the lunch special problem with that I got only 2 shrimps so I was cheated but the food wasn't that good either. it left a gooey n slimy texture in my mouth , gross!! :/  I had to brush my teeth afterwards just to get that out of my mouth. I will not be coming back here again. Some of them r not friendly n usually they bring u the bill we had to go up to the cashier n pay bc all of them were standing around talking instead of taking care of their customers. Next time its better just to go to Panda Express."}
{"text":"This place is a night and day difference compared to what it used to be. I actually enjoy ordering from China One now. The food was always good, but the service has gone from awful to above and beyond. They have no problems accommodating your requests and they speak much more clearly now. I am now a regular, which is great because it's right near my house."}
{"text":"Best wonton soup here! The foil wrapped chicken was an awesome app. There's always coupons, so check online to see what they are before ordering. I've never had them take the coupon, but you have to tell them which one you're wanting them to apply. Delivery times are accurate and they're worth a 45 min wait for it. Love them."}
{"text":"Good prices, good fast food Chinese, and good Boba tea flavors! And they deliver! :)"}
{"text":"I went to this location b cause I love going to the west Charlestown one. I was disappointed. The woman up front slid my card before I even finished ordering. Then couldn't cancel, she was too busy cutting me off instead of listening to my order. Then it took a very long time to get food and the chow mien was dry, the sesame chicken was soggy. Overall horrible customer service and bad food, they wanted to rush me out of there."}
{"text":"I went there and the lady behind the counter was incredibly rude.  She treated us like we were interrupting or putting her out by simply ordering.  When we got the food, it was edible, but nothing more than that.  Overall it was not a good experience at all, and we won't be back, especially since there are so many better options really close by."}
{"text":"Every time I visit I find myself thinking, \"If I were opening a restaurant, I would want that lady to manage it,\" which is a pretty miraculous thought given that I am dining at a fast service Chinese establishment, but she is amazing. I am embarrassed to say I am not sure of her name, although I think it is Merry, but she is always smiling, remembers our orders, has no problem with our special requests (light sauce, broccoli only, spicy), takes the time to read Yelp reviews and somehow discovered that I like Iced Tea, so what did she do? She crafted a way to brew an iced tea for me! She is definitely the star of this China One and knows a great deal about customer service. Since she has started, the service has been notably different. I felt she deserved a dedicated review update."}
{"text":"I went in for some lunch. They have a linch special that ends at 4pm. If you dine in you get soup with wonton chips and sauce. I had fried rice, chow mein with orange chicken and a mango smoothie boba drink. Total came out around $11.  Why give 3 stars? Food *egg drop soup was watery and had corn *rice needed some seasoning asap *chow mein had chunks of onions and very little prtion of noodles *orange chicken was hard And they put 2 pieces of cold broccoli in it Also as I was eating customers came in asking for some boba tea but they didn't have any at the moment. So they left, then the employees started making fun of them. Only thing I liked was my drink and the wonton chips First and last time I'm coming here."}
{"text":"The food came from phone to door within 25 minutes. All of the food was hot and fresh.  The crispy shrimp that came with the family meal tasted like it came out of a bistro.  The wonton soup tasted home made and wasnt over salty like most places.  The chow mein was fresh and they didnt use that same sticky crap most places use.. All of it was good."}
{"text":"The foods not good and I ordered sweet and sour chicken with no vegetables he read it back to me and when I opened my container it was full of vegetables"}
{"text":"Have been going to this restaurant for years and also for delivery, But after today I will never be returning. I ordered the lunch special which comes with soup, I was not able to finish it all, so I asked if I could take the rest home (after all I am paying for the food). I Was told that I absolutely under no circumstances may I take any unfinished food home with me, including the soup which I hadn't even touched and wanted to take home for later . \"It is for eating in only\" explained to the ignorant lady that I did eat in and would like to take the rest home that I could not finish, since once again  I am PAYING FOR IT!!!! I was told no way we don't do that, it must be finished here and can never leave their Establishment, WTF I told her I have been coming here for years and that I will never be returning, She was like that's fine. Guess they don't need any repeat customers. Typical  customer service at Chinese food establishments."}
{"text":"Very rude employees, I came here to enjoy lunch with my wife and two kids I don't like Asian food so I went to port a subs and came back to eat with my family but when I tried to eat my sandwich while my family was eating their Asian food I was told by the employees that I'm not allowed to eat my sandwich because I didn't buy it here and even though my family all purchased food I was told I would have to eat my sandwich elsewhere. After I told him we would never come back then he said he would allow me to eat with my family just this one time. I will never bring my family here ever again"}
{"text":"We were loyal customers but we will NEVER be back. I stopped in to get a Thai tea, handed them my debit card and she handed it back and told me I had to spend over $5 to use my card. She asked me if I wanted to add something to it. I told her if I did I would have ordered it. She said she couldn't sell me the tea then. I asked her if she was seriously refusing to sell me something because I have a debit card. I am floored. There are too many other Asian restaurants for them to have poor customer service.  Business must be good if they are turning people away but they won't get another penny from us."}
{"text":"First time ordering thru yelp. Delivery was fast and the food was delicious. I ordered the tofu and veggie came with rice,generous amount of food. Will order from them again."}
{"text":"We ordered through Yelp and received an email confirmation stating I would receive my order in 45-60 minutes. An hour and a half later we received our order. Eat24 live chat was less than helpful as well.   I will never order from this establishment again due to their inability to deliver on time and I will never order through Yelp again due to the lack of assistance I received when my experience started going badly.   Both China One and Eat24 live chat need to get their acts together."}
{"text":"We ordered the family meal.   We had egg flower soup, orange chicken, chicken chow mein, fried rice, and eggrolls.  The food was fresh and the service was great.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that this restaurant had tables we could sit at. From the outside it looked smaller than it was.  We will be back to try other menu items also!!!"}
{"text":"Okay guys all I ordered was a Thai Iced Tea ($2.95). My husband got the Taro smoothie with boba ($3.55). It was around 9PM when we walked in and the restaurant closes at 9:30PM. I was expecting a little backlash but the cashier didn't say a peep. For people who live in Northwest Las Vegas, finding a Boba spot that's open after 8PM can be extremely challenging. After a Yelp search, China One popped up as an attractive option. Granted, the drink options are limited (I think there's only 5 choices) but we were just happy to get our tea/boba fix. The Thai Tea was super sweet and refreshing and my husband was enamored by the Taro smoothie, which actually came out of a slushie machine. The employee brought the drinks to our table and wished us a good night as we left. Would we come back? If we ever have a late night hankering for Boba, we'll be back.  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #156"}
{"text":"This place is horrible, I have tried to give it a chance because it's close to the house, but I've come to the conclusion that it's not any good! One thing I've noticed is how cheap they are, they dump 90% of vegetables in their orders, I've ordered multiple times thinking maybe it was just a miscalculation, when you order for instance the Kung pao chicken, there is like 5-6 little pieces of chicken mixed in with 10,000 vegetables , the ratio is ridiculous!! Like I said this happens on most of their dishes..if you don't like to eat meat or if you are a vegetarian..EAT HERE! The food quality and taste are also not that good..there is a way better Chinese food restaurant that's not too far from this spot called New Grand China, less than 2 miles away or you're better off going to Panda Express!!"}
{"text":"I've had China One before at different locations and noticed there was one by my house.   It was a good business move for China One to come to this location as it took over another Chinese restaurant.   The decor is colorful and tacky. They kept the previous teal and blue feel from the previous restaurant.   The staff is very kind and friendly. They kept coming by our table to make sure everything was good.   I ordered Beef & Broccoli lunch menu item and the food had good flavor. They allow you to get half rice half chow mein but the chow mein was a bit too garlicky for my liking. I'd recommend just fried rice.   The thing I really did not like was the water. It sounds weird but it tasted like plastic infused water, not even 4 limes could change the taste."}
{"text":"Since 2012 I been coming here & never have I been disappointed ever !!! Ty China One for making such gr8 dinners for me & my family-Highly recommended . Delivery is always prompt as well !!!"}
{"text":"wow ! amazing flavors,real chicken not imitation meat i love you china one !!! keep up the g0od work . chinese food that has a clean taste ! yay! please order the crab wontons as if your life depended upon it i wish i could freeze them they are perfectly flavored nothing like that mayo tate these imitators give you !  packed with flavor !!!"}
{"text":"Very fast service and the food was very good! Very happy with the prices here too. I got so much food for not a lot of money. I got delivery and they quoted me an hour and it came in less than 40 min. Overall very satisfied with my experience!"}
{"text":"My husband told me about this place and I'm so glad he did! I really enjoyed the food! It certainly hit the spot! I've seen the other reviews, but I had a great experience eating the food here and I absolutely plan to order from them again in the future! Last Thursday night, we had their chicken wings, shrimp fried rice, fried wontons, egg rolls AND the beef chow mein and it was sooo good!!!! The perfect treat to if you're looking for take out on any given night!!"}
{"text":"One of the places I planned to make regular on my list. Great value, great taste and friendly service. I love their lunch specials. Beats going to Chinese places in Chinatown, where they over charge and have rude customer service. They need more places like these."}
{"text":"I love this place the food is made fresh and its soo good.   It's a small place, but very clean.  And i love 2 cuz they send coupons in the mail."}
{"text":"As soon as I got home and tried my take out, one word came to mind...BLAND. I got two dishes that I always get at other places...General Tso's  Chicken and Beef Pepper Steak. The General Chicken had no heat and was almost flavorless, the chicken was pretty dry too. The beef in the Beef Pepper Steak  was tender but this sauce had no flavor either.  I decided to try a new place because of all the great reviews and I was passing through this area, I am so disappointed. The customer service was the highlight of the place. But that won't bring me back."}
{"text":"we ordered quite a bit of food for Christmas and first of all the order was all correct, nothing missing and everyone was quite pleased with the food. Everything we ordered was delicious I definitely would order from them again"}
{"text":"We visited Diamond China for dine in and take out many times; we have lived in Summerlin since 2000 and was sorry to see it close up. We thought at first \"dirty dining\" which was not the case. We, hubby, son and myself, stopped there for dinner Sunday night; The restaurant has a refreshing new look, flooring, booths, tables. We ordered the 2nd meal for 2-6, extra shrimp skewers, won ton soup, egg rolls, cheese wonton, lemon chicken (was ok, coating a bit dry; use duck sauce for dipping) beef chow fun, special chow mein, pork fried rice and must tell you everything was hot, delicious and the bill was not expensive for our order (plus take home!) The wait staff/servers are nice and friendly and kept sodas full. I like that the noodles weren't plain, bland beige. Colorful orange along with the veggies and meats. Next time will try sesame beef and orange chicken and who knows what else. Keep up this 5 star rating!! Debbie, Gene and JR.."}
{"text":"Coworker came over to my office today and mentioned she was in the mood for \"real\" chinese food, and not \"that Panda Express @#$%\"  Luckily for the both of us I'd been racking my brain for over 30 minutes scouring Yelp on what to eat for lunch.  I then remembered that I had a takeout menu for China One and simultaneously thought of the good reviews it gets and that they deliver.  My sanity was saved!    I called the order in and must not have been talking to the same person other reviews mentioned.  I understood everything she said perfectly and in no time our order was on the way.  We both decided to try the Chicken in Spicy Garlic Sauce lunch special.  30 minutes later the food arrived at my office and I dug in.  There was a LARGE portion of chicken and veggies in the sauce, then half half fried rice and chow mein.  They also offer steamed rice but I was feeling piggish.  Also included was a bag of those crispy fried wonton strip thingies that I adore so much.    I was fairly disappointed in the rice and chow mein.  I'm sure it was just some higher being's way of punishing me for not getting steamed rice, but the chow mein tasted bland and the fried rice tasted generic.   Is it as offensive as it sounds to say that I would have preferred Panda Express' versions of these?  I liked the sauce for the entree quite a bit, it wasn't nearly as spicy as I'd like, but the flavors of garlic, jalapeno, mushrooms and some bell peppers and onions shone through.  The chicken was just okay, and I definitely found the pieces that were drenched in the sauce to be better than the more dry ones.  Price was great at basically $6 for each order, and I don't even think they charged for delivery which was another bonus.    For food alone, I was considering a 2, but with the ultra cheap price, the free delivery, and the little bag of bribery containing the wonton strip thingies, I'll bump them up to a 3."}
{"text":"I haven't had any issues ever ordering from here. Ive usually been for take out and the food is always hot and fresh. The portions are quite generous. The lunch specials are reasonably priced for the mass amount of food you get. My one disappointment was the salt and pepper pork chops which weren't crispy at all, more of a bread crumb coating instead of the cornstarch coating I've grown to love."}
{"text":"I have recently moved to Centennial Hills and found this restaurant. I have never dined in, I just order pick-ups & delivery. My first order was amazing, I kept going back, and I am now known when I place orders. The food is delicious, the prices are GREAT, the portion sizes are very generous(thumbs up), customer service is good, and the delivery times are always on time.   The only thing I wish was better is the time on boba drinks. They only offer boba after 12pm, which may not be a big thing at all for anyone but me, since my schedule is pretty difficult. Overall, this is my go-to for Chinese food"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best Chinese food I've had in a long time. I stopped eating Chinese food, because I couldn't find a good restaurant. The prices are right and the food is delicious. Try the mongolian beef, kung Pao chicken, and the mu shu chicken. I've also had a few dishes that were okay, but not my favorites. There hasn't been a single meal that wasn't at least tasty. This place is super casual and has delivery."}
{"text":"So just stoped by for some boba today and it was good. The lady that made it asked my daughter if she likes boba. My daughter replied she loves it so she hooked her cup up with about half full. Things like that make it a great visit I get food from here all the time and it's always fresh and good. But today the customer service is what parents look for. Happy kids make for a great afternoon."}
{"text":"Probably some of the worst Chinese food I've ever had.  Husband ordered the shrimp in lobster sauce & it was flavorless.  Shrimp was mushy as if they were overcooked.  I ordered chow mein & the noodles were overdone, sticky and the taste was bland as well.  Also ordered chicken fried rice & that was unflavored too.  Everything tasted bad.  We won't be back.  Very disappointed that ordering 3 dishes cost $30."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery and got my order pretty fast. I ordered the teriyaki chicken bowl but got beef instead.. the Singapore noodles were done well with not too much curry but the right amount for great flavor not too overpowering.. the vegetable rolls were crisp.. this was first experience and I'd check them out again... prices are fair and consistent with other competitors and service was better than average.. sorry no pics, I was hungry, my bad..."}
{"text":"Fast delivery and good customer service! They've always been very accommodating to customizing entrees (usually asking for no onions or bell pepper and the sort.)   Delicious wonton soup and good sesame chicken. Their fried rice is pretty awesome too. The chow mein is pretty bland and their egg rolls greasy.   It's not perfect, but it's leagues above than the alternatives in the area!!"}
{"text":"Their employees are very friendly and their restaurant is always clean.  Their delivery service is pretty quick for $3.  The food is hit or miss, sometimes it is decent, but mostly the beef is questionable every time.  Prices went up so I probably won't be going back anymore, especially with healthier restaurants in the area offering better prices."}
{"text":"Their food sucks.  I ordered the Orange Chicken and it was hard and way too sweet.  The brown rice that I ordered with it was terrible.  Hard as hell and no flavor whatsoever.  My friend ordered the Mongolian Beef.  They put 15,  yes 15 red peppers in her food but they also filled it with a bunch of Jalapeno peppers.  Really?  Do they want to burn a hole in her stomach.  My roommate said the combo chow mein was good but they included some weird fried noodle things that was supposed to go with it.  Totally odd.  We ordered delivery and that was the only good thing about this place.  The food came in pretty good time.  Also the only other thing that came that we actually didnt order was the fried wontons and those were good  and the pot stickers were ok.  Very bipolar place.  Don't get it.  I will never order from them again.  As far as I am concerned,  I wasted my money on ordering from them.  There are much better places closer to me that I can order from.  I am stunned this place got 5 star reviews.  Ridiculous. Never again.  Lame and the person taking the order had to be told 3 times the numbers for the food we were trying to order.  Get it together."}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoy eating here. We go here at least twice a month. Don't be afraid to try new food here. Delectable, generous portions as well. Friendly staff, helpful and courteous. Recommend eating in. Take out is fine. We eat in and take home extra order of war wonton. Yummy ."}
{"text":"Love this location. The staff is amazing, good is delicious & consistent. Cashew chicken is delicious, the crab Rangoon is a must & the wonton soup makes me so ridiculously yum!!! The staff always go above and beyond to make sure we feel well taken care of; even adding soup broth to our leftover soup so we had enough to warm it up for lunch the next day. This type of service is so rare in Vegas& to find it in an unexpected location is a true treat! Hunny had strawberry smoothie & kiddo had Thai tea.  Both super satisfied! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Chinese food that i have had in Vegas ....big portions was a big plus and it taste really good...this is gonna be my go to place for Chinese food from now on"}
{"text":"I have only tried a few items on the menu so far, and each time it was for take out.  The egg flour soup was fresh and a large portion.  the complimentary items that come with each order are a nice touch.  Every entrée I have seen prepared,  looked delicious and I'm looking forward to trying them to see which ones I like best.  I'll continue to review the different entree's and post pics along with each."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this new place since I saw it a few months ago. Placed order to go that they said would be ready in only 5 minutes. Wow! Fast. I ordered Mongolian beef and veggie chow mein. Yum, it was delicious. The mogolian been was really spicy but great flavor. It went well with the veggie chow mein, as the chow mein was a little sweet and had broccoli and mushrooms. Can't wait to try their lunch specials. So much to choose from on their menu. So happy I've found a new Chinese restaurant in NLV. Will definitely be back again and again!"}
{"text":"They are so fast with their delivery and food is kept warm just like it would come right off the stove!   Love ordering here, great food and service!"}
{"text":"Love this place , the lunch special before 4pm is only 5 dollars and it soo good I always get the orange chicken one and the plates are very full I love it"}
{"text":"Food is Good here! They even deliver pretty far...food was delivered on time."}
{"text":"I went on this place around 2pm and they have a lunch special. Im guessing from noon to 4pm. The lunch special comes with a steamed or fried rice, plain chow mein, a soup, wonton crackers and 1 entree of your choice. I chose an orange chicken with a fried rice.  It did not take that long for the plate to arrive but no one brought me a soup nor the wonton cracker and the sauce. Not even a glass of water. I have to ask for it before they deliver it. The guy only brought the soup but still no wonton crackers, sauce and water. When I tried the orange chicken, it was hard. Taste was okay. Small portion of chow mein but house fried rice has a good amount of it and taste okay too. The only concern I have is the service. I'll try to come back and hopefully by then, service is more better. Taste of the food is good though."}
{"text":"I took my family to china one to dine and disagree, this isn't authentic at all in fact the food was the worst I have ever experienced, their service is OK although we were one of two families dining. Both my wife and my son had to go to the Doctor the following morning."}
{"text":"I ordered hot & sour soup at ~ 7pm & the quality of soup was reduced; no shrimps, only broken pieces of artificial crab, more watery soup than veggie. -------- I came back here today (2/21) for lunch. Instead of ordering lunch, I wanted to spend more money and order regular items. Then I realized I had a $2off coupon from Eat24. I asked the girl who was going to take my order if I could order from Eat24. She appeared to be uncomfortable and made faces & said yeah. Then she talked to her partner, who was sitting at the next table from us, is also Chinese & worked there in Chinese. I could tell from her voice tone, so I asked again if it was a problem because I didn't understand what would be the difference since I ordered from Eat24 before. Her partner said me, \"You know it is a 3rd party vendor right? You can only order to go. We prefer you order with us.\" I asked why they prefered with them, if they didn't like Eat24 then why they partnered with them for ordering. She started to go off at me & being sacastic by saying \"Yeah Yeah..you can BOSS. That's fine Boss. You are right.\"  So, we left. We just wanted a good lunch with good customer services. We didn't want to deal with sarcasm. We would have been more than happy to order thru them if they knew how to communicate with their customers better without being sarcastic and making unnecessary faces. We wouldn't come back again!  Now we are having lunch happily somewhere else on Spring Mountain."}
{"text":"Love this place! We order delivery at least twice a month! The food is delicious, and they have generous portions. It never takes more then 45 minutes for delivery either. They have a huge selection on their menu for every different taste."}
{"text":"Tropicana location sucks. Best locations are on South Rainbow and the other in Summerlin. Been going to the Rainbow location since 2008 and although there's a language barrier we communicate without issues. They're so friendly. I gave the Tropicana location one star because the foid is luke warm and the place doesn't smell so good."}
{"text":"wonderful surprise. excellent  food..did not expect much..boy, was I wrong!  more than ample servings at a reasonable price..quick and speedy service.  I will return.  it was really excellent..try this place..."}
{"text":"This is a very beautiful restaurant inside. The food was prepared to my wife's specific needs which was a plus. Won ton soup was delicious. It was a slow night so the wait staff was cut back because of that I'm sure however it was ok yet not as attentive as I would have liked."}
{"text":"Much better food than its predecessor.  Wide menu and decent prices.  Stoic service but the food comes out quickly.  Great for a business lunch as it has large booths.  Great egg foo yung and tofu dishes."}
{"text":"Nothing special here... Basic Chinese food and was bland :( me no like bland food ! I enjoyed diamond China who was previously here ... Will not return :("}
{"text":"We went here Tuesday afternoon for lunch. Later that night and the next morning 2 members of our group; a toddler and a pregnant women who had eaten the exact same thing, the fried rice got food poisoning. Both got extremely sick and needed medical attention."}
{"text":"Since we've moved here my husband and I eat here all the time.. The good is beyond good. Everything is flavored VERY well and the portions are very good. The customer service is awesome and super friendly. The lunch are dinner special combos are great. My husband and I always get a dinner combo B and it's so much food that he has lunch left overs for at least 2 days (which he loves) I absolutely LOVE the crab ragoons here, they are soo good and actually have filling in them which seems to be a rare occurrence at most Chinese places now for some reason. Not to mention the house rice.. It's literally loaded down with pork, chicken, AND shrimp. This is by fat our favorite place to eat."}
{"text":"Really tasty Chinese food. I have eaten here a few times in the past and I've always enjoyed their food.   Just missed the lunch specials that end at 4pm, but the prices are very affordable, so it's all good.  Very cute decor, super clean, granite table tops with nice chairs/booths.   Note: FREE Smoothie or drink with your Yelp check in. Great little freebie!  We ordered the house fried rice and orange chicken which also came with a side of steamed rice. Very generous portions for two people to share with a doggie bag to go.   I love their food. It's full of flavor, great texture and very tasty!  They also offer take out and delivery.  Great Chinese food in Las Vegas. East side of the strip on Eastern and Tropicana."}
{"text":"I love China One. I used to go to the one on Durango out in Centennial which I must say is still my favorite location. HOWEVER since I work at a nearby hospital I've been going to this location..I like it a lot..I don't have any complaints about the dishes I've ordered from there..the delivery is extremely fast every time. My . Favorites are the spicy fried wings which taste better when you put all the toppings on it and take a bite (yummy) then the kung pao shrimp, fried won tons, shrimp with broccoli, shrimp egg foo yung,  Singapore noodles..omg I could go on and on lol! Good food."}
{"text":"The food is great, but the lady answering the phone was SO rude! I figured it was a language barrier she didn't speak very good English. But when I went into get my food, she didn't even say hello and just told me my total and was so rude!"}
{"text":"I too was sad to see Diamond China go and held off on visiting the new owners. However we ordered a large take out order $160 worth the day before Thanksgiving. When my brothers and I arrived early they had some free appetizers waiting for us and were very gracious to us. They sent us home with a boatload of food and I can say there were no complaints from anyone. The spicy garlic shrimp was a favorite as well as the broccoli beef which for a change from most places didn't have over cooked limp broccoli. We will definitely be back. And thanks for helping our family continue our pre Thanksgiving Chinese food night tradition."}
{"text":"I'm a regular this location and usually the food is great but today I experienced what I've read in reviews in the past. The food was so bad . Egg drop soup was literally egg and really hot water. The house rice had 3 pieces of shrimp after I had just asked for $3 extra shrimp . Everything needed salt and the beef was like gum. Very disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Looking for a quick bite before returning rental car to the airport. Son wanted Chinese and we found this place. Mongolian beef with fried rice is delicious. Son enjoyed his orange chicken. Large portions and speedy service. Would come again."}
{"text":"Prices are good the food is made extremely fast... I was expecting 15 minutes but was told it would be ready in 5 minutes it was actually ready in 3 minutes. Customer service is good everyone is polite."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great value, world class service by very friendly people. The food is always good, spicy when you want it, and always at the level you tell them. My generals chicken almost had me crying just the way I like it. Also the manager and I got to talk abour how messed up the white privileged world is and how much it can suck to be a person of color in the states, especially as immigrants."}
{"text":"Excellent Food and Service and very affordable.  Everything was very fresh and flavorful.  Best Egg Rolls had a long time.  Highly Recommended!  Todd & Sandra"}
{"text":"Really fresh and very good.  The Beef Chow fun was excellent, but my favorite was the General Chang's chicken!"}
{"text":"When you almost always order the same thing for take-out, it's easy to monitor the quality and consistency of a restaurant.  And because the stuff my husband will deign to eat is limited to chicken, chicken, or chicken, I'm limited, too.  He went to the restaurant to order, rather than call it in, to be sure that the instructions were understood:  ginger chicken with broccoli plus extra ginger, and no extra salt, and a large hot and sour soup.   He noticed that there was a chef he'd never seen before.  Even though we weren't too thrilled with the food the last couple of times we ordered from there, there was no comparison with this disaster.  The soup was complete glop, like eating fresh mucus.  It was spicy enough, but beyond that had absolutely no flavor. So disgusting that even the four shrimp and imitation crabmeat couldn't make up for it.  It used to be very good.  The chicken dish had two infinitesimal pieces of broccoli, and no extra ginger. The only flavor was SALT, lots and lots and lots of salt, so much that I couldn't bear to eat it.   The only reason for two stars instead of one is that the woman who took the order gave us the two egg rolls that we usually get with their coupon, which we didn't have.  They're no great shakes, either, but it was a nice gesture."}
{"text":"Everything I expect in Chinese fast food, but with great service. I had the garlic chicken lunch special, which had generous portions. Yummy! Will be back! Perfect lunch break spot."}
{"text":"This is the most disgusting food that I've had in such a long time. Me and my buddy showed up at 9pm and apologized that we came in towards their last 30 min. They said it was fine but that we HAVE TO leave after  we get our food. Like ok? Anyways, me and my buddy took the food home and the texture of the meat was so bad that it seemed as if they took all the fat trimmings and decided to make a bowl out if it (I ordered a basic teriyaki beef bowl), the taste was even worse. I usually have a huge appetite after working out but I have never gotten so close to throwing up after eating fast food until then. I don't care if they read this and offer food for a lifetime to compensate for my horrible experience, I will never go back and my body through that again."}
{"text":"This is the only Chinese restaurant here in NW that I actually enjoy going back to. It's a small restaurant that's why many order to go. Their quick, great food, quantity and reasonably priced. My all time favorite crab rangoon, eggplant veggies stir fry with tofu & beef broccoli."}
{"text":"First time here. Went for lunch right a 11am. First customers of the day.  I say that because service started off slow but became more attentive as others came inand they got their groove.   We had the lunch specials. Beef and broccoli and Mongolian beef. Both plates were well filled for lunch specials.  Both came with egg drop soup and dry noodles and sauce. The platters came with cooked noodles and rice.  Very filling. Overall taste and satisfying. Nothing outstanding but a decent neighborhood Chinese sits down place. Better than others in the area for the price."}
{"text":"this is the best  Chinese restaurant i had ever been ! they're food and service is perfect !"}
{"text":"This has been by far the best Chinese food I've had in a long time. Authentic and taste homemade. The place is very clean and the service is great! Amazing kung pao chicken and teriyaki chicken! If you've ever come to vegas, you must try this place!"}
{"text":"I mostly just come here for the icy taro boba drinks they are the best, perfect for the summer time when it's 115 degrees outside."}
{"text":"Over all it's pretty good. Not spectacular but not bad. Used to be a chinese food junkie but this curbs the craving. Delivery was here about 10 mins before it was estimated so that was impressive. Rangoon's were delicious as is the steamed rice. Ordered the S&S Chicken and chicken was good though was a bit unimpressed with the peppers, onion, and pineapple pieces (just one) that came with.. Could tell they weren't freshly cooked. BBQ pork fried rice is ok- has peas.  Bf got something beefy that smelled really good. Haha  Will prolly order again next time we get the craving though."}
