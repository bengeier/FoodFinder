{"text":"$7 menu items...all night long! Great quality food with perfect portions (beats the hell out of a big Mac combo at less cost), good beer selection, all reasonably priced. Will be going back time and time again."}
{"text":"I've been here just under 10 times; service was okay, and food was also okay, nothing exceptional. Prices are great. However, I went in one night about a month ago with my boyfriend and his 2 friends, and we had a terrible experience. Our waitress kept messing up our order (which happens so we don't hold it against her; it was pretty busy) but when we got our bill, she automatically charged us an 18% gratuity. When I brought it up, I said \"Oh, you automatically charge gratuity for tables of 4?\" And she rudely replied \"Yup.\" And literally ran off. We were so upset because we had only noticed after we paid and tipped her. When I brought it up to management, they were so rude and sassy with me, and said there was essentially nothing they could do. They did say that she shouldn't of been able to access that option and that they do not charge automatic gratuity for tables of 4. All they said is \"if you're ever inclined to come back, have a drink on us.\" We are all college students and we feel robbed of our money. The management didn't handle our situation professionally, and last I heard, our waitress is still working there even after blatantly stealing money from customers. Will never be returning there again out of principle. If you go here, I strongly suggest double checking your bill before you pay, because they also like to sneak in additional charges without notifying you."}
{"text":"It's true what they say - everything on the menu including cocktails is $6.95. Interesting marketing move - worked on me anyways. We ordered 2 mains - chicken and waffles and the tilapia. Both were generous portions for what you pay for and both were good. Not exceptional but good. Again for the price point, you feel like you get your moneys worth. The service was attentive and the ambiance works for this bar. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"A great location on the lakeshore - especially being so close to Humber College. It's a great place to hang with friends and enjoy quality food at a decent student friendly price. The service is wonderful."}
{"text":"As a Humber College student, I'm grateful that such a nice pub exists so close to campus, and with a price a student can actually afford: $6.95 for everything on the menu.  Of course, this pricing is great, but a little weird. That means that a salad is the same price as a burger, which is the same price as a drink?  Anyways, I won't complain because pub food for $6.95 is frickin awesome.  We tried the pourier burger with egg and the chicken and waffles, since it sounded interesting. The burger was great and came with yummy fries, but the chicken and waffles were weird. The waffles were okay, but the sauce tasted strangely alcoholic. It was a very strange tasting sauce; very rich and tasted a little like something that's been fermenting. I guess it's not for everyone. At least I can say that I've tried it! But I will not be getting it again.  Aside from that, I will definitely come again because the prices and atmosphere are worth it! Our server was also very friendly."}
{"text":"The refinery has a lot of potential. The big highlights are cheap food that tastes good and a decent atmosphere. The pub could be cleaner(lots of dirty tables and floor space) and the decor could be better."}
{"text":"It's a nice new pub with a great beer selection, affordable, simple and yet creative menu. Not a typical kind of place for the area, way nicer than anything around."}
{"text":"After my previous message Trevor the owner/operater of this establishment kindly contacted me and asked how he could make it right. I suggested the trip that we had won on new years that had rudely been just given away in a short time when they had our phone number on this ballot. He said that was unresonable, as was our entire new years night being ruined was unreasonable. In our conversation I did let him know that the steps they took were illegal and he then just blocked messages from me. He said it was a threat. I never threatened I clearly stated facts. Not only can he not run things properly, he can't deal with paying customers in a respectable manner either."}
{"text":"We went to the refinery the other night for dinner..it was really a good experience  ..everything on the menu is the same price, just under 7$, which is kind of cool because you feel like you can pick/try anything off the menu and not base it on price.  The Cesar salad and  burger was SO GOOD. the fries were also good..lots of seasoning on them which I love , but if u aren't a fan of salty maybe tell them to take it easy with the salt... the gravy was also so good. The only thing I didn't care for was the drink list ..there wasn't any sangria or much mixed drinks..the waitress said a summer drink list was coming out so I'll def. Be going back and I'll update my review if I try the new drinks!  I really recommend this place  and it's kid friendly . We brought our son :)"}
{"text":"Wow.     Worst service and food ever Refinery Public House.     Previously frozen burger does not equal dinner.   I don't care how cheap your menu  is....which by the way is the reason given by both the manager and waitress as to why the food was previously frozen.  Manager arguing with me stating that all restaurants serve frozen food.   Wow.... Well not the restaurants I go to.  Both waitresses doing shots with clients.    Didn't bring me cutlery for 10min After my food arrived.  Honestly the worst was the manager saying she'd only discount half the burger because I ate some. Worst customer service ever.   Worst food ever.    Worst experience ever.   Yes...  What did I expect for $7 meals.    Well apparently better than that.    They couldn't care less about quality or customer service."}
{"text":"My friend and I went there for a meal and a few drinks. I've been there a few times before, and while the experience was nothing to write home about, it was inexpensive and in walking distance.  I ordered a drink right away. When it arrived, I couldn't taste any alcohol in it. I asked my friend to try it - she couldn't taste it, either.  I politely informed the waitress that the drink didn't taste right. To which she adamantly insisted that the drink was right cause she poured it herself. She was very abrupt and made every effort to make me feel like my complaint was ridiculous. After a lot of arguing she finally went away to make another drink, which she pretty much THREW on the table, turned on her heel and without saying a word, stormed away.   Shocked, my friend and I stood up and left.  We were furthermore shocked when the barmen (or whoever he was) went chasing us on the street, threatening to report us if we don't pay for the drink. To my protests that this was the worst service ever, his retort was that I (!!!) was rude and that I should be lucky they are ONLY charging me for one drink. And that the \"waitress\" can do whatever she wants - cause she's (drumroll, please) the owner.  We paid the 5 bucks. They made me pay for something they didn't provide.  Horrible place. I think the way they treated us probably reflects the kind of clientele they often get - people trying to cheat their way out of paying their bills. In which case - if you do choose to go - take care of your personal safety."}
{"text":"Wife, 2 year old boy, and I came right before the Super Bowl game was on.  We were in the mood for some greasy goodness.  Summary: Everything is $6.95 here, please have reasonable expectations.  We went in with those, and we had a great time.  Decor: This is a local dive/sports bar.  My wife & I looked at each other, smiled, and said, \"y'know, there aren't enough of these.  This feels so comfortable.\"  The weird part though is that the light bulb above our booth inexplicably turned off... and a few minutes later... turned back on again.  Our server says it's a known inexplicable thing that happens for minutes, so there ya go.  We did not have salad.  We did not come here for salad.  You don't make friends with salad.  Mac & cheese: Not gourmet, just simple greasy goodness.  By the end, I wanted more.  I'm a savage.  Similar with the poutine, but a bit salty.  Calamari: It's ok, nothing great.  Since it didn't sate the greasy goodness pangs, I'd pass the next time.  Nachos: When you get a plate of nachos with that many different ingredients on it, you think you can make it at home for $6.95?  Granted, it's like a 1/4 bag of nachos, but for the labour involved and the fact that you'd have all these leftover ingredients afterwards... (unless you eat a whole container of sour cream, a jar of salsa, and buy bulk olives, etc.)  Would order again!  Beer: Lots of taps, but it's not like a lot of craft beers or anything (I remember they had PBR!).  My wife had a half-pint, and we liked that they had that option.  If we didn't have the boy... we'd have watched the whole game from there.  However, we'd have probably taken off when it was 28-3, and missed the biggest comeback in SB history."}
{"text":"Very slow service food takes forever to come out waitress forgetful leaving tables dirty after customers walked out an hour prior waited for my salad dressing that I was told was coming separately I finished my meal and never came.... Quality of food not even worth 6.95$"}
{"text":"So I wrote awhile back that the food wasn't great. I was not correct. I haven't given the \"maple gravy\" a go again but their fries are perfect. Seasoned fries, perfectly crisp with there onion dip, mmm mmm good. The burgers are also really tasty. Light brioche buns make what would be a heavy burger lighter. The burgers are tender, juicy and I recommend the Poirier for those who like a side of meat with their meat or Bacon cheese burger for lovers of the best things in life. Service is still really good. Amiable staff who make this a great place to go back to again and again... Plus everything on the menu is $6.95. They also carry a wide selection of hard ciders which is about as close to beer as I'll ever get."}
{"text":"Super rude and unfriendly staff. With drinks and food that is average you'd expect the staff to be good but no, they're rude and I'll always just go to Sloppy Joe's now."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Kind of like El Furniture Warehouse's less-cool suburban stepsister, the pub offers all meals at $6.95. However, unlike El Furny, the drinks are not priced astronomically. For $6.50 I got a full-sized premium pint of Blanche de Chambly.   The burger I had was pretty decent and had beef brisket on top as well. The fries were amazing - thinly sliced and browned to perfection - and automatically come with a tzatziki-like sauce. I had a bite of the poutine and have to admit it was quite strange. As another reviewer pointed out, it has a strange alcoholic Guiness-like flavour that I wasn't particularly fond of.   Service was good. Our server was pretty chill, came by just enough and wasn't pushy or in a rush to get us out of there.   It seems that they typically have live music in the place. As we were leaving at around 9, a band was setting up to play; definitely something to check out sometime.   Definitely recommend this place, especially if you're on a budget."}
{"text":"Totally acceptable and probably fantastic as a student dive bar.  Beer is cold, food is hot and both are cheap.   But if you are passed that phase in life the cleanliness of this establishment is horrendous (or, just as I remember student dive bars being like and had conveniently forgotten about, from my days in school). Sticky floors, soggy menus and bathrooms that smell like only the smells of dive bar bathrooms that have not been scrubbed for weeks with hundreds of bugs flying around (in the winter) as you relieve yourself.   I would have been fine with this place as a student, probably not the ideal spot if you have a kid dropping stuff on the floor or needing to use the restroom.   Am glad to see they are doing well as they definitely fill the need of the local student population."}
{"text":"Awesome little pub where they have an amazing selection of draft beer from all over the country was very excited after moving back to Toronto from Calgary that they had a beer from big rock brewery in Alberta! Staff is very friendly and everything on the menu is 6.95 which is awesome for people on a budget"}
{"text":"In general I'm a fan of this place because it changes up the usual trashy crowd that hangs around this area (Thanks Dimitri's place!). The fact that their menu is set at $7 for everything is amazing as the food is quite good! The mac and cheese is definitely recommended but they have plenty on their menu and they have a lot of TV's if you're keen to watch sport and events happening every now and then. Not a bad joint for a relatively young-middle aged crowd.  Also the sponsor pub for the Etobicoke Kangaroos Australian Football Club. Great fun having them around!"}
{"text":"Excellent place to eat. They did have to close but they have since reopened. 6.95 everything on the menu. Excellent food. Good atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food was cheap and good. I had the burger and it was bigger than I expected. It was nothing spectacular but for that price you can't get anything better. The wife had the maple poutine and she couldn't finish it because of the maple gravy.  She wished there was a choice of gravy because, unfortunately, the maple/mustard taste was overpowering and wasn't to her liking.  We split the chicken and waffles with some friends who had the wings and skillet perogies. I liked the C&W but again the gravy threw some of them off. Personally, i didn't mind it.  The service was friendly and the place had a charm. There's a lot of potential here and I have this weird feeling like they're still trying to find their identity BUT with that being said, you should definitely give this place a try and support a local business :)"}
{"text":"Great Local Watering hole !!!  Good people good times great drinks ! Staff is friendly people are chill and drinks are decent priced !  Stop by and grab a pint !"}
{"text":"I've loved every meal I've had at this little nook on the Lakeshore. The two guys who run it are always very friendly and it's an interesting mix of regulars and drop-ins. Had a date or two there - it's an alright spot, but since its small you might feel exposed on an obvious first date.  Some choice with beer and really great food makes this a frequent choice for me."}
{"text":"Honestly I didn't know what to expect coming into the restaurant, a couple colleagues told me it was a great place and that the food was unreal especially for the price. Now how can you beat $6.95/ea. for everything on the menu? Umm you can not!   Had the chicken and Waffles and though it wasn't a full breast, it was very tasty, cooked right through, crispy and full of flavour. Add the Maple Bacon it was the perfect lunch.   I will be coming here often as I want to check out their burgers as well."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate dinner last night and were thoroughly impressed. It's the kind of place New Toronto needs to turn a small corner,  without becoming Bloor West Village. The food was  great, perfect portions don't get left on the table or as UFD at the back of your fridge.  I had brisket and she ate the mac and chac. Both great options for under $7. Tasty, fresh and full of food and love. They even have a great beer/cider selection on tap. We are in the process of weaning my wife off of sugar booze and onto some fine ciders..Seems to be working! Service was great and prompt. It wasn't too busy but excellent attention to quality, details and customer service.New Toronto is a strange area with a dearth of quality restaurants and bars. I believe places like this will address the two solitudes that bridge North and South of Lakeshore.  Best of luck, please hang in there and we may lure folks west of Roncy!!"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner with my 2 girlfriends on a Friday night.  The waitress was extremely rude and the service was incredibly slow.  Maybe it's because we weren't drinking so she wasn't interested in us.  The food was mediocre Definitely wouldn't come back"}
{"text":"Heard about this place through another local bar and decided to check it out. I ordered there baked Yukon rounds and they were so delicious! The guy working was super polite and nice as well! Loved this place. Oh and everything on the menu is $6.95 can't really go wrong with that"}
{"text":"We were staying at an AirBnB in the area, and were looking for a good dinner place. I looked around in Yelp and saw this one listed. Their little thing of having everything listed on the menu for $6.95 sounded like an intriguing idea, so we decided to give it a try.  Now, of course everything *starts* at $6.95, but if you want anything extra, it's going to add a little bit. Pretty much everything is extra, but that's okay.  We started off with the nachos, which were good, with some beef added and some guacamole. Everything was cooked nicely.  Lee got a bacon cheeseburger which he seemed to enjoy pretty well, it was properly cooked and maybe a little bit on the juicy side, but all together good.  I decided to go for the chicken and waffles. It was good, although I felt that the plate it was served on was a little small for the food, and the maple-mustard gravy was a little bit overpowering. It's not something that everyone is going to enjoy, and I do wish they had regular gravy for poutine, because we ended up not ordering the poutine -- we knew Lee wouldn't like it.  They have a great beer selection, with local and popular favorites (those do not adhere to the $6.95 menu) and some cocktails on the menu that look intriguing.  So if you're in the neighborhood, check this place out!"}
{"text":"Love everything about this place, the ambiance is chill, the servers are courteous and friendly, and the food is excellent. Chef just changed the menu, which includes alot of items made from scratch. Had the devilled eggs (delicious), fresh rolls (excellent choice of fillings), and the veggie burger (best veggie patty I have ever tasted). The frites were cooked to perfection. Lots of options, such as gluten free and vegetarian, and the price can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Been to this place a couple of times. A nice hangout for a mix of crowd. Open mic nights and trivia are how they are constantly changing things up. Most of all anything on their menu is $7 bucks all day, everyday day. Notably some portions are small and you get what you pay for but for the most part it is totally worth it. Always have a good time at this place. I wish though that it would be more heated in the winter since there is always a cold draft within the pub itself. Food is your standard pub grub."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  The menu has a good mix of options and you can't beat the price.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"So sad to hear about this place closing down!   As a student at Humber College, friends and I have frequented this spot for the last two years for birthdays, student nights and even impromptu date nights.   The staff was always friendly, and the food couldn't be beat being both affordable and delicious. I missed the chicken and waffles with maple bourbon gravy when they disappeared from the menu, but there were enough new options to keep everyone satisfied!  Hopefully they can move to a new location in the area!"}
{"text":"Went here today for a quick dinner. We parked on the street, but you have to use a machine to pay for your spot--that a bummer.   The decor of the place is decent, they have bout 3 booths and a bunch of tables with the bar at the back.  Not many TVs close to the booths so it's not the best place to dine and watch a game.  The men's washroom was in poor shape with the door getting stuck as you try to open it and the soap dispenser didn't even work--they need to tear it up and redo it.  The server was super friendly and quickly provided us with menus and explained any questions we had   All items (salad/apps/entrees) are $6.95.  We wanted the chicken sandwich, but they didn't offer it anymore (they need to fix that on their website).  At any rate, we ordered the spicy chicken tacos and the cheeseburger that came with fries. They had Sleeman $4 drafts which we ordered as well.  The food came out within 15 minutes. The tacos were good, but you didn't get much (they come with no side). The burger was a thin patty but it tasted pretty good dressed with lots of lettuce and onion.  The fries were the winner here, thin, crispy, and very tasty."}
{"text":"I just ate here for the first time, and it was honestly, fantastic.... I ordered to pick up a brisket sandwich with cheese and bacon (I highly recommend doing it this way), and it was amazing! Perfect amount of onions so you get the slight hit of them... Not overdone with the sauce, and it has a really great bbq flavour, I was super impressed.   The only complaints I have, the three dollar extra barge for pick up orders. BUT, it's understandable because dine in is really cheap considering, and the food was worth the price. Also, the French fries were pretty disappointing... Thin, dried out and a little cold when I got to them (I only live 3-4 min drive from there).   So for about $15 if picking up, you get a good amount of food, definitely recommend, and cannot wait to try the other dishes!  The bartender/server was cute as hell too ;)."}
{"text":"Visited the last 2 days, as I was at the funeral home down the street. Service needs a major upgrade."}
{"text":"One of the coolest bar in the area. The neighborhood needs more places like this. They have cool student nights on Thursdays, where the beer and food is pretty cheap."}
