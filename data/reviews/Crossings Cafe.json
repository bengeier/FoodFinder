{"text":"Menu is fairly simple, but daily specials are usually what you want to select from. Food is consistantly good. Attracts an upscale, local crowd who wants a casual night out."}
{"text":"Great little place.  Ive only been there for breakfast and it's quite good.  The potatoes need some work, they are bland and a bit too soft for my liking.  My favorite is he Challah French toast with sausage patties."}
{"text":"My coworkers brought me here for a farewell lunch, and I must say I wasn't expecting much.  It's your typical greasy-spoon-type restaurant with not a single fancy offering.

The food was decent.  I opted for a house salad, and was presently surprised that they actually had olive oil in house instead of your regular ol' vegetable oil.  Also impressive is that they use mixed greens instead of iceburg.  I also had a bacon burger (no cheese) with mushrooms and onions, which was pretty tasty.  It was cooked a bit more than I would have liked (not even a hint of pink to be seen), but the beef seemed to be of good quality.  It was a greasy beast, but that's basically what I was looking for.  I can't comment on my dining companions' foods.  They all seemed to be content with their meals, but I also know that none of them actually seek out good-quality food...ever.  To them, this place is fancy, seeing as it's not McDonald's and all.

The service left a bit to be desired.  We had a younger guy in charge of our refills and the such, and despite how many times I said \"thanks\" I only ever got glares from him.  Obviously, he did not want to be there.  Our waitress wasn't quite as surly, but she wasn't exactly friendly, either.

Honestly, I don't think this place is worth a visit as there are much better options in the area."}

{"text":"The St Pattys day menu was not good overall. 
The soda bread spinach cheese app was disgusting, soggy bread.  The lamb stew was tough. The beer cheese soup was excellent.
The lamb shanks were ok, coddle and green beans were cold (13$). The others had shepherds pie (11$), just grease. 
The even got the kids meal wrong, cheese wedges and fries... Horrible as per the 10 year old. Two of us had corned beef sandwiches, arrived late (not with the other food) very dry and served with chips (8$).
Next year stick to your menu."}
