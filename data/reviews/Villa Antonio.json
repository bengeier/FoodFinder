{"text":"The sausage and peppers dish was delicious!! I should have had that for my dinner. But I ordered a filet mignon. I know, I know...who goes to an Italian place and buys a steak? Well I did. It's on the menu, so they should know how to cook it...right? Well, it was the toughest filet mignon I've ever had in my life. The seasoning was not bad, but the lack of tenderness ruined it.   The drinks were really good and ambience was really nice. I would go back. I've learned my lesson. When you go to Italian restaurants, stick to Italian food."}
{"text":"We ate there last night for the second time. Both times the food was great  and service first class.  When we got there they were busy it was a Saturday night and our table had the sun right in our eyes. The blinds were adjusted as much as they could.  The owner had on of the bus boys stand there for the ten min it took for the sun to move on.   Our waiter said what ever it takes.  I would rate the 5 stars +."}
{"text":"Fathers Day brunch was very disappointing.  And was also doubled in price from their regular buffet prices.  When we got there the prime rub was gone, nobody asked us for drinks.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Even though it seems better and nicer than an Olive Garden, maybe because everyone has a broken English accent as if they may have been grown up in Naples,  I'm going to say if you looked hard, it's more of a \"me too-er\" to an Olive Garden.  There are no linens on the table, at least the booth we were in, and the menu is short with common traditional dishes in each category, nothing too complicated.   These people are busy though; maybe too busy.  When we called for reservations,  I went to give our name and the guy just said yeah 8:45 good and hung up.  The restaurant is located in a village with several other restaurants within a 500 foot radius.  We were met on the side walk by and older gentleman who was hustling up diners, and I quickly recognized the voice as the man who hung up on us.  I told him we had reservations and he asked our name! \"No name, you hung up on me!\"  \"No problem we got a nice table for you\" he says as he puts out his hand to shake mine and then grabs my wife's hand and plants a nice sloppy kiss on it with a \"principessa benvenuto\" which i guess makes the kiss ok!  He kissed my wife's hand twice before we were seated and once more after he put her coat on. One kiss is cute from someone who may be old enough to have been in the orginal Romeo and Juliet play or at least the first talkie film remake, but three times pushes toward the \"dirty old man\" catagory.  They had three large parties. Servers were sharing responsibilities for the large groups as well as their own tables.  I don't know how the other tables received service; but ours was courteous, but scarce.  We didn't see or waiter but four times.  Once for drink order, once for our order, three to bring us food, and four to bring the check. No, sorry five, he brought my credit card back and a 3 second thank you.  Maître d' stopped by a few times to ask how everything was and refilled our drinks, brought us a pepper mill and checked back in afterward.  Think we saw him more than our waiter.    Our waiter asked if it would be ok if he brought out our dishes as soon as they came up, omitting the planned lag time allowing for social interaction which is part of the dining experience.   Good thing we've been married 20 plus years and we weren't on a first date!   We were seated in a booth alongside a long table of a party of 18.  The desserts were the closest dishes resembling the beautiful ensemble of pictures posted on trip advisor by the management. Nothing else we saw, although neatly presented, looked close to those posted pics. We started with the Grilled portabella mushroom marinated in balsamic and topped with eggplant, tomato, fresh shaved mozzarella, and basil then finished in a fire roasted red pepper sauce.  It was good.  Could have used a little more sauce as we were scraping to add its flavor to each portion.   For the main course we had the Osso Bucco, a slow braised veal shank in a marsala red wine sauce over risotto and topped with crispy spinach; and the Veal Michelangelo, which was veal scaloppini topped with eggplant, prosciutto, roasted red peppers, mozzarella and finished in a roasted garlic and rosemary sauce with a side of angel hair.  The shank was tender but under seasoned for my liking and the risotto was bulky, heavy, and not good. The marsala was fairly dense but ok.  The veal dish was just ok but all was a little on the bland side.   The desserts came presented on a tray for your choice.  They were nicely plated.  My wife had the tiramisu, which she likes but I've never cared for so I can't comment on it.  She said it was ok but for 9.00 she's had better.  We topped it off with a 2.75 cup of coffee and we're done.  Worth mentioning is the valet service will give you a card which will get you 5.00 off your total bill in any of the village restaurants.   Helps pay for the extra hand sanitizer your wife or date will need!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are from Los Angeles and were in town a couple of weeks ago for business. We were staying down the street at the Four Points Sheraton. We went walking down the street in search of a good restaurant. We saw the colorful lights and a full parking lot at Villa Antonio so decided to give it a shot. Wow! We sure were glad we did.   The food and service were amazing. They serve yummy bruschetta to start. We ordered the brie and mushroom soup, a caprese salad and spinach salad to start. The soup was so heavenly we had to get another. The salads were fantastic. We also ordered a bottle of Malbec which was perfect. Then came the surprise palate cleanser between courses....lemon sorbet with champagne. OMG! Then came our entrees: he got bacon wrapped scallops atop whipped potato mounds, and I got the salmon with crab meat, asparagus and dill sauce atop mashed potatoes. Both were absolutely outstanding. I have never had such a perfectly cooked salmon. I was so full halfway through but I couldn't stop eating. It was too good. The service was also outstanding...Vincenzo, Fidel, Jesus, Matt, Anthony, etc. They all made us feel so welcome and were so attentive. It was such a wonderful experience, we had to come back the very next night with three friends.   The next night they had a live piano player who sang and played beautifully. I had sangria, lobster and crab bisque, stuffed mushrooms, calamari and caprese. Yep, I was a glutton for sure. Perfectly delicious again! My husband got the brie and mushroom soup again, and of course, I stole several spoonfuls. Best creamy soup and best mushroom soup ever!!!! Our friends also loved their dishes.  I can't wait for our next trip to Charlotte so that we can go back. We are fortunate to live in LA where there are a lot of great restaurants. But Villa Antonio is by far our new favorite. They need to open one in LA!!!! Though it's probably good that they don't or else none of my clothes would fit for long!   Well done Villa Antonio! What a fantastic restaurant!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is nice.   The service and the food are not!  Period. Disappointing. Don't know how it has stayed in business this long - in Ballantyne no less!  Waiter barely spoke English. Food was greasy and mediocre, beer selection was poor, and when we went for drink specials the employees kept pushing us to buy food when all we wanted were drinks. Not to mention there's an older man who stands outside and fishes desperately for people to come in the restaurant and hands out gift cards.    I couldn't wait to get of there but it took a while because we wanted to use the gift card we'd been given but then were told we didn't order enough food to use it but that they'd \"make an exception\".  WTF?"}
{"text":"Great service  and good food.  Too bad they're moving to a smaller restaurant location at Ballantyne. However, still worth trying if you like authentic Italian."}
{"text":"I came here for the 9.95 lunch buffet.   Considering I only spent $10, I would say we received excellent service and the food was pretty good. I had a good helping of salad and other dishes (salmon, pasta, fried ravioli). I don't think I would have enjoyed any of these dishes if I had only one (they are definitely not gourmet) but as a buffet having the variety was a very good value.   The host shows you the buffet before you decide to get it or not so you know if it doesn't look appealing, just order from the menu!   I find that at restaurants when you choose a lower end option, the service is not great but I really appreciated the fact that the servers were giving us attention. It's what made my experience great."}
{"text":"This review rating needs to be broken into 2 parts: food/service. The easy part. the food is easily over 4 stars, close to a 5. This is a high end Italian dining as the pricing indicate. The food was excellent and was visually appealing. Now for the service. We arrived just after 5PM on a Saturday evening hoping to beat the crowds that arrive around 6. We saw tables open but was told there was a 25 min wait. We sat outside as it was nice outside and there were already 2 families dining outside. Once seated, a staff member brought water and brushetta. Over 15 minutes later, we had to get up and let the host know that no server came to our table. (If we did not have a gift card, we would have left already) Finally, one server came with menu with a short apology. Three minutes later a different server came. Our orders were placed and food arrived on time. At the end, we gave our gift card and waited over 10 minutes. At this point, we wanted to just leave a small cash tip on table and leave as we had no exact idea what the final total was. We went in and finally found our check. Final check was $5 and change after gift card deduction. The service rating was easily a 1. There is no excuse for a restaurant of this venue to have such terrible service. We won't we back."}
{"text":"This place is great. The location is trendy and beautiful and the restaurant itself is warm, authentic and inviting. My mother and I went for a nice relaxing dinner and that's exactly what we had. The maitre'd was charming and took us to a table that matched that quality. The cocktail list had numerous options and the wine list was extensive. We chose a Pouilly Fusse Chardonnay which was marvelous.   Our app was a napoleon of crab, shrimp, goat cheese, fried tomato and zucchini fritter. It was perfect. The crab was fresh and the shrimp was crispy. The fritter was moist on the inside and crusty on the outside. Nice balance of flavors and textures!  Dinner was seared diver scallops with lemon truffle mashed potatoes, sautéed spinach and fried julienned tomatoes. This was the only hiccup throughout the seemingly perfect meal. The mashers were extremely watery, a result of boiling the potatoes for too long and not putting them back in the oven to dry out. Also, The fried red tomato sticks were worth the college try but were unnecessary as they added nothing to the dish. On the flip side, the scallops were absolutely amazing, cooked and seasoned to perfection.   Nice selection of desserts. Tiramisu 4 out of 5."}
{"text":"It was my first time going with my family for mother's day. My husband made reservations. We got seated like 10 minutes later which that's not a problem because we weren't in no rush.   We order our food. My kids had macaroni and cheese which needed some flavor. I order Pollo Parmigiano which it was good, but I think the spaghetti need a little more flavor. Dessert was ok.   They need to work on how to put more flavor into their food. If they do their food would taste a lot better. Even though it was busy the service was on point.  My drink was a Pomegranate martini which I do recommend trying."}
{"text":"My new favorite Italian restaurant in Ballantyne  , excellent customer service , excellent food and ambiance.  I had the Lobster Bisque and Atlantic Salmon melted in my mouth like butter. Dessert the famous chocolate cake and homemade Italian ice was an added bonus. Live music was on point, the whole staff made my experience and wife's birthday dinner very special , one she may remember for a longtime. Thanks, continue to strive for excellence and never settle for less."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I eat out almost every meal. I travel for a living and eat all across the US and I have to say this was by far the WORST service I have ever encountered. The waiter was EXTREAMLY rude and was shushing us he handed my girlfriend a plate that burnt her hands. My Shrimp in the pasta was that undercooked translucent color. After sending it back 2ce the 3rd time they made it look like jerky just to be assholes. 3 of the dishes at the table were undercooked. All of the mashed potatoes were cold. This is the craziest thing I have seen the waiter took our bread from our table and placed it RIGHT ON ANOTHER TABLE! They automatically charged a 17% tip for the worst service I have ever seen, On top of it all they tried to charge me for the undercooked and over cooked shrimp. When I brought it to the attention of the waiter he said \" I don't think there was a problem with the dish\". The waiter when serving pushed peoples arms away with the plates. Horrible food bad service do not ever eat here. The only good thing of the night was the aps and they were average at best. After I got home I had extreamly bad cramps from th food."}
{"text":"Tried the grilled chicken the other day. Plenty of flavor. Good service but quite slow. So I can't rate it a five star. I may come back for tasting other food."}
{"text":"I love this place the food is amazing the atmosphere is wonderful it's just a beautiful place Antonio makes you feel at home he comes around and say hi to you shake your hand talk to you its very welcoming and a very cozy elegant place.  Rhonda Douglas"}
{"text":"We like going here for special occasions.  Love the lasagna. Good service.  Romantic atmosphere if you get a booth.   Live music."}
{"text":"We love the Villa Antonio on South Blvd. The service is impeccable, the food is delicious, and we always leave feeling special. My husband and I had a LivingSocial deal for the Villa Antonio in Ballantyne tonight and we're very disappointed. We will only go to the one on South Blvd from now on.   When making reservations at the one on South Blvd, they always ask if you are celebrating anything special. My last birthday we came to our reservation and found our table decorated with special touches. When we made a reservation to this restaurant, we weren't asked that question, nor were we given an opportunity to mention it as the employee seemed rushed.   After we received our appetizer, we had to wait 30 minutes for our entree. Our waitress finally came and asked if we wanted her to continue to hold our entrees in the back (as if she had been doing that for awhile) while we finish our appetizer. I'm not sure if that's protocol, but we wanted to put the rest of our calamari to the side so that we could have some with our entrees if we wanted. If she had asked us before that time, maybe our food wouldn't have been lukewarm when it arrived. The restaurant always brings a small sorbet with champagne before your entree as a palate cleanser. I suppose with the entree being held back so long, she decided to skip that part. Being one of my favorite parts, it was very disappointing.   After we ate our entrees and had the leftovers boxed up, we sat for another 20 minutes without our waitress coming by with our check. My husband finally looked mad and an employee asked if everything was ok. We had to ask him for a check and then wait another 5 minutes for our waitress to bring it. I would understand some confusion if we had food in front of us, but our food was boxed up on the table while we waited with no one stopping by.   We left extremely disappointed with my birthday dinner. Even with a LivingSocial deal, we will not be coming back. I hope this location doesn't give the one on South Blvd a bad reputation."}
{"text":"I went there with a group of 8 friends for my 40th birthday. Everyone from the hostess to the waiter to the bus staff made me feel like a VIP and my guests all enjoyed delicious food, good wine and impeccable service. We met in the bar for drinks first and listened to live piano music, then were promptly escorted to our table, and then stayed for some music and dancing in the bar. Our food took a little longer than usual I think because there was a large party of prom goers, but it still mostly  was a good, relaxed pace.I have been to both locations a few times before and I know its normally a relaxed fine dining pace, but usually not such a long wait for dinners. I could not have asked for a more relaxing, fun birthday and Villa Antonio is the only place in Charlotte that I know that does it this well. If you're looking for a great dinner, fantastic martinis or wine list and a place for dancing and music for the over 30 crowd, this is THE place to go.  Also, their patio is amazing and we had originally planned to do drinks prior to dinner there but it was raining."}
{"text":"I'm so torn over Villa Antonio.  This restaurant has a bit of an identity crisis. The food was very good...but small portions, overpriced.  The service was a bit slow but professional.  The ambiance is nice, but kinda cheesy. (Uh, life-sized statue of a chef holding a pizza, I believe?) Would I go back...it's a toss up.   Armed with a Restaurant.com $25 certificate, my husband and I went the other night for dinner.  We were promptly seated at a cramped two top, but after asking for a booth, the host was able to change our table.   The meal started with, what I think was supposed to be an amuse bouche, two small pieces of bruchetta.  Now, I'm no amuse bouche (did I even spell that right?) snob, and it was yummy...but seemed kind of random, and was more than one bite.   After a yummy house salad (nothing out of the ordinary, greens with goat cheese and balsamic) out came a palate cleanser of a sweet mango sorbet.  About the size of a melon baller scoop.  Again, don't get me wrong, this is nice, but it was too sweet and seemed kind of forced...as if a restaurant was trying too hard to be fancy-pants.   Wait, before I forget, I should tell you we were offered chilled salad forks to eat our salad with.  This I find pretentious and necessary...and actually, our fingers were freezing!  I got the special, which was cannelloni of shrimp and lobster and scallops. The portion was pretty small for the approximate $35 price tag.  I mean, think the size of a deck of cards.  I know, America is obese and that's the correct portion for dinner...but honestly, couldn't I have gotten a bigger dish and taken the rest home or something?  Anything to make me feel better about spending all this dough on an entrée?   Everything just seemed a bit forced.  The scraping away of crumbs between each course.  The smattering of dried parsley as a garnish.  Skewering a lone scallop with a sprig of rosemary.  Decorating your dessert plate with a cocoa-powder stencil.  I stress: the food was good, no complaints.  The service was kind and efficient. No complaints.   Ultimately, the dinner, even with the Restaurant.com certificate came to be about $70, and gratuity was already added on.   By the way, the bathroom doesn't match the upscale ambiance of the restaurant.  It's red and black with tiles you'd see at a Five Guy's Burgers and Fries.   They also indicate on the menu's back page if you drink too much and need a ride home, they'll call one for you.    Again, random.   PPS:  A co-worker tells me the restaurant was featured on Chef Hunter on the Food Network. The chef that won didn't get hired, because the two parties couldn't agree on a salary. Interesting!"}
{"text":"I was expecting much better service for what I was spending. My server was basically nonexistent. Both my salad and entree didn't have the bacon that was promised on the menu and i had to ask for it on the side. I didn't receive drink service in a timely manner, about 20-30 minute intervals. I received the wrong drink then had I wait 20mins to have it corrected. I had to wait 10 minutes after my friends got their food to receive mine and then my filet was undercooked. My girlfriends grouper was overcooked and dry with the wrong pasta. Our server did not check on us after our food was delivered. After our main course was taken away we waited over 40 minutes for our dessert choices, after all of our friends had already paid! Then we were told we should get our dessert to go because everyone else was... due to the horrible service. Not satisfied spending over $100 for this. There's much better restaurants for less money."}
{"text":"Ate at the Ballantyne location on a whim New Year's Eve, walked in early without a reservation, was seated promptly in the private dining rotunda room with no wait.  The food, service and presentation were all fantastic.  The maitre d' treated us like rock stars, especially my girlfriends teenaged kids, couldn't have been nicer. Our party had the portobello mushroom, shrimp cocktail and Italian sausage apps, and osso bucco, veal parm and filet mignon entrees.  Everybody loved loved loved their dishes, the kids were blown away.  I have eaten in many of Charlotte's better restaurants over the last 3 years, and I must say that Villa Antonio was among the best dining experiences I have ever had in CLT to date.  Well done."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner recently and I don't think I will go back.  We ordered a bottle of wine and our server threw out the cork so we had to either finish the entire bottle with dinner or throw it out, which we had to do with some of what was left unfortunately.  The server was ok - not super friendly or anything.  While we were still eating, he took our check from our table and looked at how much we tipped him in front of our face.  It was pretty rude and weird for such a high-end place.  My husband didn't care too much for his lasagna - said it was pretty dry.  I got a chicken dish which was pretty good, but not the most amazing thing.  For how much this place costs, I really don't think it's worth it at all.  I would go to Mama Ricotta's over this place any day for a fraction of the price and way better food."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews here, I was a little worried it wasn't going to be a value for the price. I went during restaurant week (July 2014) with my Dad and was actually impressed. It started poorly -- the manager/host at the front would not listen when we told him we had dinner reservations because there was a wine tasting event and the \"assumed\" we were with with them despite me trying to tell  him 3 times we were there for dinner.   After we were actually seated and stopped dealing with him things went well. The staff was curteous and sweet. Beers were poured in chilled glasses. Food was brought out promptly was quite good. Our favorites were the Sweet Chili Calamari for appetizer, Chicken Parm, Filet Mignon over Polenta (very good sauce!). The tiramisu was a disappointment -- comes in a large glass but the cream is too thick and the layers don't taste that good. They did bring us a Pina Colada Sorbet with Champagne in between the appetizer and entree which was a great touch.   Overall good experience and nice environment with a very clean inside. If it wasn't so blazing hot would have considered sitting on the patio which looked fun but not as comfortable as the nice interior."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Villa Antonio for our 5 year anniversary last night. We fancy ourselves as knowledgable about Italian restaurants because our family owns one.   Food - We both thought the food was excellent. My wife's favorite is linguini in white clam sauce. The flavor was excellent. Usually with this meal it is better the next day because the flavor sets into the pasta. Villa Antonio's was very flavorful  at the table. I had the veal piccata and it was very good as well. I had it over angel hair instead of the whipped potatoes that it is normally served on. Great flavor. Portion was like it should be. If you go to Italy you get smaller portions so you don't gorge yourself and this was spot on.   Service - Angel was our waiter. He was attentive without being a nuisance. We mentioned that we were catching a movie at our favorite theater across the way in 1.5 hours and he made sure the food roles out at a nice pace so that we weren't rushed. He made sure to stop by and pour more wine from the bottle we bought when  our glasses were low.   What made the night unique - As stated earlier we were celebrating our anniversary. I was asked this when I made the reservation. When we arrived we were wished a happy anniversary. Our table was decorate with some festive items (albeit they were birthday items but it was the thought that counted). At the end of the meal we were presented with a nice dish of chocolate drizzled strawberries and a serenade of \"happy anniversary.\"    A lot of little details that other restaurants don't think of included warm dishes for our appetizers, fresh silverware after each course, and a cold fork for the fresh strawberries.   If you are looking for a relaxing night out we can't recommend Vila Antonio enough. You need to pay attention to the details when you looking for a nice night out. Is it pricier than the chain restaurants?  Yes. Are the details worth the extra money?  YES.   Thank you for a great night and see you again soon."}
{"text":"After reading these reviews I was a little apprehensive about eating here. Only because my entire family is from Italy and I have a hard time enjoying italian restaurants but this place changed my mind for sure. It's a little pricey but the food was fantastic. We got the filo rolatina, veal gorgonzola, chicken parm, and of course a cannoli all fantastic."}
{"text":"After eating here a few times I've decided that while this place is pretentious, the food is good. The place offers a very formal setting and assumes you are there for a long evening. For example, they don't give you the menus when you first sit down, you get to first contemplate what you want to drink. They offer some complimentary tasty bruschetta followed by some bread with balsamic vinegar a bit later. Between the starters and the main they offer a complimentary sorbet drizzled with champagne so you may clense your palette.   The portions are massive, the prices are not modest, but the food is very tasty. Everyone I've ate with there has been pleased. The dessert card at the end is silly, especially if they turn on the sirens.   Ah - the place also has live music - some poor guy by the window singing his heart out."}
{"text":"Went there for Sunday brunch...Not good at all. Food quality was below average and service was poor."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with the Network of Executive Women. We all got the buffet and had our own private room. The room was a little dark for a work lunch, but if I was here on a date it would have been very romantic.   I've been to the Villa Antonios off South Boulevard and didn't really care for their buffet. The same story held here, where I could find much that I liked. I ended up with meatballs and wild rice soup. There weren't many choices and I left just wanting more.   Hopefully dinner is better because I bought a Groupon."}
{"text":"We dined here last night with my husband's company for a retirement dinner and were seated in the center of the restaurant in a round room all to ourselves. We had several waitstaff and they were all decent, not really sure if it was better than average service that one might expect for this nice of a restaurant. They did seem to take good care of the President and VP of Marketing who sat at the other end of the table (who were picking up the tab), and our service wasn't bad, but certainly not super special.   We had a predetermined menu to choose from and I had french onion soup, chicken and cheesecake. The soup was nice, good bread and cheese on top and not crazy salty. The chicken was served with a crab meat infused sauce and polenta that was ok, but I wouldn't get it again if we were to return because of sauce which I just didn't care for.The polenta and asparagus served with it were both cooked nicely and a nice complement to the chicken. The cheesecake was creamy and had a nice flavor though I would be hard pressed to say it was the best I had ever had. The tiramisu that others chose was served in a sundae type glass and looked very good.  My husband got.the filet and shared a couple of bites and it was very good...super tender and nicely spiced.  Overall, it was a nice visit, my glass was never empty, our group of 20 or so had plenty to eat and the decor is very nice. Easy access and parking garage make the Ballantyne area restaurant a nice choice."}
{"text":"After trying VA-Ballantyne a few times for dinner, I finally went over to check out them out at lunchtime.  I normally prefer not to eat from a buffet, but I decided to give it a try.    We arrived on a Friday a little after 12 and the place was pretty packed. However, they had a table available for us so there was no wait.  The buffet was not bad - they had a soup selection, salad bar, and then the hot food bar.    On the hot food bar, they had grilled chicken, a seafood dish, fried ravioli, mixed veggies, and penne pasta.   The price was reasonable and they did a great job keeping the buffet filled."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the friendly knowledgable service.  I went for the Osso Bucco this time, served over risotto.  The shank was fork tender.  They topped w au jus not the traditional thickened braising stock.  So it lacked flavor.  The risotto was like eating creamy thickened rice; no parm flavor, no chicken stock flavor, and it was not made w short grain arborio rice.  Highly disappointed  on my third visit this year.   But they are generous with the pour for a glass of wine."}
{"text":"I have been here for the club and the dining!  The club is a meat market that starts about 11pm, the dance floor is too small and though they play good music you are pressed up against people and the place draws the pervy crowd, it seems to me. (meaning, if you are a girl and you start to dance alone, give it 4 seconds before someone is dancing ON your behind!) 0 stars for the club!  I brought my Mom and Sisters to dinner here on Mother's day before the bar turns into a club on another occasion and it was quite nice, the presentation was pretty and the service was good.  We had my 2 year old niece with us and they brought her fresh strawberries to nibble. We enjoyed the meal and dessert. It was quite elegant in that instance. (3 stars for that)"}
{"text":"Met here for a \"Meet and Greet\" Meetup for \"Successful Singles\" which was lead by Lori Ann Davis, so I just had to come! She always does a great job as a Meetup Coordinator, but the turnout was quite light this night.....Not her fault.  Anyway, this was my first adventure to THIS location, as I was a loyal customer to their old South Blvd location (now torn down) and consolidated here. My thoughts...  Nice for sure, but kind of \"Mall Suburbia\" and lacking that \"je ne sais quoi\" that the South Blvd location definately had. But it IS in a better neighborhood for sure!   Here's my \"beef\" with this place. Quite simply, THE BARTENDER! Just NOT a good one! He ignored me the whole night (it seemed), and when he did serve me, it was totally like \"what the F&%K you want a$$hole!\" I kid you not! I felt like I was bothering him the whole time. Now I've got to say, Charlotte has a LOT of really cool, attentive bartenders hustling hard to earn a living and to get a good tip. This guy just didn't care. I am not sure I'd ever come back just because of this pi$$ poor attitude of this guy....no kidding!  The ONLY reason I gave THIS location THREE stars is because the Crab Cake appetizer I got was really good! Not the best crab cake I've ever had by ANY imagination, as it could have been done much crispier....but the Lobster butter sauce was devine! As many of you know, I'm pretty schooled in the art of creating classic French sauces, and this one was right on the mark! Butter? Check! Great emulsion? Check. Nicely seasoned? Check. All good. A tad too much greens on the top but the flavor profiles were spot on!  Got a couple of wines to drink during the night....a tad pricey but good.  Overall, a nice time. But ownership, you need to find better a Bartender.....Who knows, he may be a relative. Even so, I'd still find a BETTER ONE!  Peace out!"}
{"text":"Nice place to dine but the food was not tasty at all. Good service. The brunch isn't bad but def has room for lots of progress."}
{"text":"I am only commenting on the brunch.  It's very pricey given the very limited selection and the quality mediocre at best.  The pastries are pre-packaged and the bacon is way over done.  It was actually burnt. Stay away for the brunch.  I can't speak for the other meals"}
{"text":"Its difficult to update perfection but Villa Antonio seems to be able to do it effortlessly. Today is our second visit to their fabulous Sunday buffet. We were seated after a brief wait and a friendly waiter took our drink order and we proceeded to the brunch. It seems almost wrong to say that it's a breakfast buffet. Buffet seems too plebian to honor the food being presented. Brunch on the other hand evokes a dining experience where one's senses are fully engaged.  Everything presented smells delicious. Everything that I put on my plate was seasoned perfectly and tasted great when eaten together, savory and sweet complimented each other with perfect balance.   We also had a nice talk with the manager. I think this will become a regular Sunday destination for us."}
{"text":"Went for date night with my husband. Our waiter didn't know the beer (which was on the menu) that my husband was ordering. We finally got our drinks and ordered our food and that was the last time we saw our waiter.   Other staff members brought our food and refilled our water. My husband was unable to order another beer since our waiter never returned.    Our food was delivered and tasted fine. Nothing extraordinary. Certainly not the best Italian food. We ordered dessert - a cannoli which was only half filled (see picture). Our drinks were left empty in this time and I had to ask a manager for our check.   Our service was beyond disappointing and the food was mediocre. We won't be going back to the ballantyne location. South Blvd. has their act together - and was a much better dining experience.   Try Luce if you want similar menu options but a better experience."}
{"text":"Had a business lunch there.  The food was awful.  the setting is nice, conducive for a luncheon but don't take advantage of the convenience of the buffet.  Its not much better than a tv dinner.  I have had dinner there and I'd rate it 3 stars."}
{"text":"First time here. A bit pricey for Italian, but you can sense the prices when you first enter and eyeball the upscale decor. $26 for veal dishes, tasty but small portions. They are very accommodating for substitutions. Potatoes can be changed for a variety of pastas without an additional charge. My wife's veal piccata was not that tender and a rather small portion. Same with the veal saltimboca, although tasty. Service was very good; professional, not pushy and sufficiently laid back when needed.  I did hear the lucnh buffet was very good; both pricing and food selections."}
{"text":"My wife and I just had a stellar meal here. We went almost on a whim, and are glad we did. We got to the restaurant at 9pm and left at 10:30 stuffed at satisfied. (Around 10 the bar area turns into a dance-club, which might be nice to come by and try out some time when we are less full of fantastic food.)  Was greeted at the door by the formally dressed maître d' who shook my hand and welcomed us in. He caught me off guard and I returned his manly handshake with an awkward lady-like squeeze. When he goes to type up his review on yelp-handshake I doubt it will be as good as this one. But on with the show...  After we were seated, as we were perusing the wine list, we were served two delicious pieces of bruschetta.   We then ordered a bottle of California white zinfandel, which is my wife's wine of choice. It was impeccably served and set in an ice bucket nearby.   I won't even try to remember the Italian names, instead I will describe the dishes- Our appetizer was lump crab meat, goat cheese, and flash fried tomato. It was fantastic- yet still eclipsed by the tomato bisque that I ordered as a starter as well. I can't even begin to describe how sinfully good this soup was.   We were then served a dollop of lime sorbet to cleanse our palettes- I could have eaten a half-gallon- I'm a sucker for sweet-tart-frozen tasty treats. It was heavenly.   We both ordered pasta as a main course. My wife chose the Lobster Ravioli in a cream sauce and I chose a dish of lobster, mussels, shimp, and scallops over linguini with a tomato based sauce.   I enjoyed my dish, the sauce was not stand-out but the seafood was fantastic. I also sampled my wife's ravioli, and it WAS stand-out in every way.   We finished our meal up with Caramel Cheesecake and coffee for her, and tiramisu and espresso for me. The Cheesecake was a slight disappointment to my wife. I sampled it. It was not very much like your typical cheesecake, and didn't taste especially of caramel. I found it to be spiced a bit like a carrot cake or fruitcake. Which is fine if that is what you expect. It was good, just not what was expected.   But the tiramisu, oh the tiramisu. It was fluffy and light yet rich and sinful. I could taste the cream in it. It was amazing. The espresso was also outstanding. A tiny cup of blackest caffeine. A great way to end the meal.   By this time the bar area was starting to convert to a dance club and the thumping dance music was starting to drown out the Italian crooners still playing over the restaurant's music system. I didn't mind either one, but both together was a bit of a cacophony. Not a big deal, considering it was around 10:30 and there was only us and a couple other tables remaining- also considering the excellent service we received throughout the meal.  Ah yes, the service. Welcomed at the door with a handshake. Seated. And at every step of the way the service was efficient, friendly, courteous, and impeccable. Complements for the food were more than once received with a gracious, \"Thank you very much\". Another handshake and thanks from our waiter ended our service for the evening. All that was left was for us to polish off the last drops of wine, and head to the door.   In short - Good food, impeccable service."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Good food but be prepared for the $. They have bananas foster!"}
{"text":"I went to the Ballantyne with my Livingsocial deal - 2 brunch buffets with Mimosa.  My brother came to town and we went for brunch.  The staff was very professional and the food was delicious.  I strongly recommend this location."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try villa Antonio for quite some time. As we were seated, the server (one of 5) took a bit long to even give us menus.  The food was ok, nothing to rave about. I've had much better and way less expensive Italian food in Charlotte. Way too overpriced! The service was so inconsistent. Not to mention I felt like there was a different person coming to our table every 5 minutes.  I don't understand how they had 50 men in tuxes walking around and yet our service was slow. The decor was also a bit corny. Not really wanting to go back..."}
{"text":"This place stood out to me while I was driving in the area. So I gave it a try one time during lunch break. My experience was not so great though. Sure, the service was good and the free bread was extremely tasty for free bread, but my entree could not have been greasier. I had the Chicken Carlotta, which came with crab meat and asparagus, but the dish had a slight depth to it, and my food was probably sitting in about half an inch of plain grease. It made me lose my appetite as soon as the server placed the meal in front of me. And I will probably not visit this place a second time."}
{"text":"We went to Villa Antonio for Mother's Day.  When I made the reservation, we were not told that there was only a buffet available. There were no signs in the restaurant regarding the price of the buffet, except the normal Monday-Friday buffet that is $9.99.  We were told to go ahead and serve ourselves.  We had expected to order off the menu, but when we realized that was not an option, being as it was the first time we had gone to this restaurant, we did not expect it to be outrageous.  When the bill came the charge was $30.00 a plate and 15.00 for a child's plate.  There was also an automatic 18% gratuity of $30.00 added to the bill for a party of 6.  When my husband talked to the manager regarding there being no information regarding the price, the manager's response was \" we've been here 27 years and everyone in Charlotte knows we have a buffet on Mother's Day.  So for those of you like us, who are part of the 1% that \"don't know\" be warned.  We will not be returning to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Solid italian restaurant.  Somewhat pretentious but the service is spot on.  Food is ok - not excellent but worth a try."}
{"text":"The brunch buffet is awesome! My husband and I attended a Wedding at the Ballentyne Hotel and were looking for somewhere close by to have brunch. We just happened to notice the brunch sign and were pleasantly surprised.   The buffet has everything you could want for brunch from breakfast items like bacon and eggs to lunch fare like chicken Marsala and prime rib. The Mac and cheese was amazing. The summer salad was fresh and flavorful. I can honestly say I enjoyed everything I tried."}
{"text":"Have eaten here numerous times and usually everything is spot on perfect. Not this time. It wasn't horrible but seems things are missing that are important for people like myself and family to continue to come back. First thing was the wine I wanted, out. Now I would understand if it was a Rothschild but it wasn't. So who dropped the ball on ordering? Common items should always be available. Lobster bisque was superb. Everything else, Meh... No palate cleanser either. Disappointing. If I wanted meh, which I don't, then I would go to Olive Garden which I won't. My suggestion is to step it up because I'm sure I'm not the only person this has happen to."}
{"text":"Villa Antonio is clearly on its way out as they make way for their new place, GUSTO Pasta and Tapas (which I hope they will be much better at - most people don't want those \"heavy duty meals\" anymore. I'm laughing my \"B\" off about the review talking about the \"older man\" standing in the doorway of VA and running out to lure people in with (well, at least she got a discount card - I got a few kisses on the hand and was called. . .\"princess\" I think). We live close by so have seen him doing the same thing with so many other folks. It's REALLY annoying! Let's see how GUSTO serves us."}
{"text":"I have been to Villa Antonio twice in the past 2 weeks and have been may times throughout the years.  It has always been an entirely good experience from the reservation to the goodbye.  Every time I go I am warmly greeted by a \"professional\" Hostess who acknowledges our arrival and tells me if my party has been seated or is at the bar waiting.  It's refreshing since most other restaurants have gone the way of having 2 teeny boppers who could care less if you're there or not.  The appetizers are all top notch, most recently the stuffed mushrooms were delicious.  These past 2 times I had a blackened Grouper special over a nicely made risotto and the Osso Bucco.  Now, about the Osso Bucco, I have had it all over the world and Villa Antonios is in the top 3.  Slowly braised, tender, well seasoned, and flat out delicious.  They give you a little marrow fork where, if you choose you can dig out the marrow (really, it's the best part) rather than picking it up and sucking or slurping it out which is a bit uncivilized.  Both time lately I had the Tomato Mozz salad which was nice think slices of mozz with large slices of tomato and basil covered by a balsamic glaze drizzle YUMM  In between the salads / apps they have a nice intermezzo of lemon sorbet and champagne to cleanse the palette which is mui classy.    The service is always top notch, and if you're feeling froggy get Fernando to make the Bananas Foster for you tableside.....he will amaze, and delight your tastebuds all while trying not to singe your eyebrows off!  Great Job Villa Antonio!"}
{"text":"Da Villa is a great place to go for lunch when in Ballantyne. I can't speak for dinner because I've never been, but for a weekday lunch with co-workers, your mom, your honey or alone even, it's a nice experience all around with some delish food to boot.  Man, what a boring review, Eh? Let's get down to brass tacks because the highlights can be best summed up in a list:  -Always changing buffet menu -Fresh salad options every buffet -Linen table cloths = fancy! -Ample Parking -Priced at under $10 for all you can eat -No wait; this place is rarely full so you can sit, eat and jet in 30!  I like you, Villa Antonio, and so I root for your success but will let you know that my mind hasn't ever been blown by your food. It's GOOD, just not OMG good and I think you could probably get to that point with some more seasoning and imagination."}
{"text":"Lunch buffet is quite awesome for the price. Both the salads and dishes in the buffet were better than most places that serve by the serving.  $10.  Its a good deal."}
{"text":"Took my visiting family to Villa Antonio for a special occasion dinner. We were excited to try a highly recommended restaurant! With much disappointment, service was very slow, food was below average. I would not recommend VA to anyone!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure this place is closed permanently. Looked so when I walked by it last night."}
{"text":"Came for buffet lunch one day. They walked us over to the buffet and described what was on the menu. I was originally going to get the lasagna off the menu but saw it was already on the buffet. Lasagna was so good and cheesy. They also offer soup and salad on the buffet. There is always something different on the buffet. I tried their toasted ravioli and it was good and crispy. They also had paninis which were ok. Service was good!"}
{"text":"We were first introduced to Villa Antonios about 10 years ago when they were at there other location closer to the airport. My wife and I had an amazing dinner there and the atmosphere was very classy. It truly was a great experience. So I finally returned after 10 years and I was told the original place wasn't there anymore but they moved to their new location. Decided to try them again to see of they still lived up to when I last was there. Epic Fail!!! They were very over priced for what you actually get. Ordered an old fashion drink and it was watered down and not made like a true old fashion should be made. The appetizer that we ordered was very oily and the toasted bread with it was burnt. My veal chop was over cooked. Music was way too loud. This place is not a classy Italian restaurant anymore. We couldnt even understand or server since he did not speak English very well. Very disappointed and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Very attentive service. Loved sitting outside for dinner.  The food was very good. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"We chose Villa Antonio for a graduation dinner and they way exceeded our expectations!  Food and staff were outstanding.  Next time we are in the area we will be back!"}
{"text":"When we lived in Charlotte we went to villa antonio once and it was the best date my husband and I ever had. They had a live piano player and dancing and it was so nice!"}
{"text":"Went last night and the food was great. Had crab cakes for an appetizer, salad and chicken parm. Incredible service. The owner, general manager and kitchen manager all came over to ask us if everything perfect.  They had a great band and we had a special treat when one of the customers got up to sing and absolutely killed it."}
{"text":"Don't get the prom menu. The food here taste like rubber and the service is really bad."}
{"text":"I went thinking wow an Italian Restaurant, but was disappointed.  I went there for a business meeting, and part of the meeting was lunch, and despite that the food was fresh, and warm, it had quite a bit to be desired for me.  Both the Chicken Marsala & Pork where over cooked and somewhat tough & seasoning was reasonable.  The tortellini where over cooked, and just covered in a sauce that I could have just drank because it was so loose.  For me the highlight was Chocolate Mousse which was rich, but at the same time to dense.  Proper Chocolate mouse should be the consistency of pudding.  I could have turned the dish upside down and it would still have stayed.  On top of this the staff where in a hurry to get the restaurant reset, so much that it was extremely difficult to discuss any business because table, chairs where being thrown every where.  Not sure if was the manager or the waitstaff, but many of them just had an attitude of not wanting us there.  Perhaps this was not their day, and perhaps I would try the restaurant again if I was invited, however I would not go there and pay good money for this type of food and service when there are good Italian restaurant's in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Something has caused this place to go downhill.... Used to be a favorite lunch buffet place, now it's just blah. Even librettos seems to offer more authentic italian cuisine. Sorry guys, you have lost a fan...."}
{"text":"The service is hit or miss. Came in for lunch yesterday with the wife - and every waiter walked by as if we didn't exist. Lots of waiters rushing back and forth to the register, the kitchen, the bar, everywhere except our table.   On another night for dinner the service was spot on.  The one negative I will say - which I\"ve experienced twice so its not just one incident - is the \"Mood Music\" system - (the old Muzak) is too loud. They had on techno-rave music that was so loud I could barely hear my wife. For that reason I'm not coming back for lunch next week when a friend visits from out of town - I may to across the street to the Ballantyne resort as I sometimes I need to talk without getting a migraine."}
{"text":"I ate here for what was supposed to be a quick business dinner last night at 530. When we saw there were two meetings in the restaurant we should have just left but decided to stay   The meal wound up taking close to 3 hours.  Horrible unacceptably slow service for an appetizer, salad and entree.  The food was mediocre. Nothing a ten year old with a box of pasta and decent directions could not recreate.  The between course sorbet was a nice touch but comically formal for the setting. I would rather have had dinner thirty minutes sooner.  I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I can only comment on the service in the bar area. I went with a group of 7 on a Friday night in Jan 2015 hoping for live music at the bar. They did not have live music, but they did have pushy servers and a man outside of the restaurant being very pushy to get us inside. We already intended to go in, we didn't need his help. We were waiting on our friends to arrive, but I guess he thought we were trying to decide if we wanted to eat there.  They quickly helped rearrange the seating to accomodate our party. The server did always refil the wine glasses as they needed it. My husband had a beer and I had a mixed drink. Later when he asked for another beer by holding up the empty bottle, the server brought another drink for me as well. I felt that was inappropriate without being asked. When I turned it down, he said no problem.   We ordered three deserts, one of which was creme brulee. It was delicious!  Can't comment on the others. The dining room was elegant, so I would like to try dinner at the restaurant one night.  I would not go back just for a drink."}
{"text":"I would probably give a 2.5 star.  A large group of us went to this place for a birthday dinner last night.  The place looks pretty nice and it is presenting as one of the high end Italian restaurants.   The service is not too bad. The waiter did a good job attending us and there were other helpers as well.  The food - this is where I have issues with.  They are just not that good for the price you pay, period.  Since it was a large group, we got to try each other's plates so I am not going to get into any particular dish.   To sum up, nice environment, not so good food, not worth the price."}
{"text":"If you're ever in Charlotte NC you have to make it a point to stop at Villa Antonio for dinner.  The experience start to finish is nothing short of FANTASTIC!  The service and the food!  Drinks, appetizers and main course are no joke. Rich flavors, authentic Italian food. A DEFINITE 5 star experience!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few different times and had different experiences each time but overall I'm going with 3 stars.  I had the lasagna on my last visit and must say I was underwhelmed with it. The portion size was big but the it lacked flavor to me. I like a lot of sauce with my lasagna.  I'm sure I'll eat here again (work related) and I'll update but over the last few times a 3 star is the best I can give it."}
{"text":"Once a month Villa Antonio has a wine tasting with a buffet dinner! It is fabulous! There is a specific region for each tasting. The wine steward Avery, is excellent giving a story behind each wine. You get 5 nice size tastes in real wine glasses and the buffet for $20 per person! You also have the option to buy any of the wines you taste at the price Villa Antonio's pays. Also there is usually music in the lounge! Wonderful evening!"}
{"text":"Villa Antonio provided with the best dinner I've had in my life! When visiting I had the crab stuffed salmon and it was to die for! Would highly suggest this restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is my first time at the new Villa Antonio location. I didn't know till after speaking with Fidel that the South Park location went away. The new location is brighter, and inviting. I think it makes a great addition to Ballentyne Village.  I really enjoyed my $9.95 lunch buffet. I had a huge helping of salad, potato soup, ribs, chicken, roasted veggies, and much more. The staff was friendly and very attentive. Fidel makes his customers feel at home! I will be returning soon, I have to get my hands on one of those desserts I didn't have room for!"}
{"text":"I can only base this on a work event with a limited, \"pick one of these entrees\" menu. I must say though that it was a good overall experience. I chose a Caesar salad that was properly dressed with a good, garlicky anchoviesque dressing. For my entree, had a grouper filet that was well cooked and served over a risotto with peas, asparagus with a just right, lemony hint to it. Delightful. The service was good and goodness did they ever keep the wine glasses full!  Nice experience all in..."}
