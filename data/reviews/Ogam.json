{"text":"Friendly service? Check. Delicious finger licking deep fried batter? check. Moist juicy chicken meat? Check. Sweet coleslaw to counter the deep fried goodness? Check.  Ogam chicken is conveniently located on McLeod trail across from Chinook mall. Do yourself a favour and check it out. Korean Fried Chicken is my crack and I am happy to (continuously) bring my business to Ogam Chicken!  There is a slight language barrier but the food and service more than makes up for it.  I have gone to olive chicken and chicken on the way but I have to say that in terms of tender chicken meat that doesn't taste dry, this place definitely knows what it's doing!  There are other Korean specials besides KFC and I look forward to trying them out in the near future.  The lady behind the counter is so sweet and I would suggest going to the ogam website- there is a coupon for 10% off!!"}
{"text":"I do like Korean food, though I don't profess to be extremely knowledgeable. I wandered into Ogam for a quick lunch as I was working at BVC for the day. I had the bibimbap, and was well pleased with it. Not the cheapest korean chow in town, but the food was tasty, well-prepared, and plentiful. Service was great, and very polite to boot."}
