{"text":"Delicious! Had the Leafs and a mint and lime sugar cane juice. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Crepe T.O., newly open at Church & King E. In the downtown core, offers up sweet, savoury, and all-day breakfast wrapped in tender fresh crepes. Also on offer are vegetarian options and fresh-pressed juices. The staff and management were friendly, welcoming and eager to please. Check it out for fresh, delicious alternatives to the usual hum-drum fast-food options. We'll definitely be back next time we're in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Crepes were awesome, I got the s'mores crepe. It was nice and hot, and served very nicely and customer service was great."}
{"text":"Best crepes I have eaten in Toronto!! There is a reason that this place is 5 stars, the crepes are amazing! I have tried three so far (TFC, Oven Roasted Chicken and The Beast) and all of them have been so good! The crepes are a pretty large size and stuffed with lots of fillings, they also have takeout boxes if you can't finish the whole thing. The owner and staff are all genuinely friendly, I highly recommend trying Crepe TO out!"}
{"text":"There crepes are very delicious especially the s'mores and the ding dong which is a combination of Nutella  and peanut butter with bananas. Customer service is wonderful."}
{"text":"Great service had a nice server. Thought the crepes were okay. Not the best nor was it the worst."}
{"text":"Came upon this spot as I was walking down King and was delightfully surprised at the quality and selection of both savoury and sweet crepes. I'd been disappointed that several crepe places had closed in Kensington and the only option seemed to be Cafe Crepe on Queen West (which frankly lacks the service and presentation!). In an attempt to find a crepe that matched the amazing experience I had in Tokyo, I ordered the smoked salmon one which came loaded with capers, red onion, avocado, cucumber, dill, and creme cheese. Piping hot upon arrival, it was absolutely delicious and super fresh. Despite being quite satiated, I had to try one of my favourites - nutella/coconut - to finish things off. Though not as dense as I'd like (coconut flakes vs chunks), it was still equally tasty.   What made this visit even nicer was the exceptionally polite and considerate staff as well as the cleanliness which I thoroughly appreciated!   Definitely my new fave spot for crepes hands down!"}
{"text":"Small, clean shop. Friendly polite staffs: they greet, double and triple check to making sure your are comfortable and enjoying your food. And the crêpes, Delicious!! Highly recommanded!"}
{"text":"We were looking for \"comfort food\" in the downtown- this fit the bill perfectly.  Warm and fresh.  Staff were very friendly.   Worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and all I can say is nothing but great things about this place. Delicious crepes and amazing staff, I believe his name is Rez he is always welcoming and friendly. You should also try the sugar cane and mint juice, super refreshing!!"}
{"text":"Love the best.. and usually finish it with a delicious nutella and strawberry crepe.. the. Jugo de caña is a great beverage .. good spot for a quick bite"}
{"text":"Amazing crepes! You can really taste the fresh ingredients, and the staff is very friendly as well! Definitely gotta check them out :) I hear their sugar cane juice is good too"}
{"text":"Best crepes I've ever had!   - lots of variety   - the staff are super friendly  - great setup"}
{"text":"Over the past several years, Toronto has seen a growth in crepe shops. Crepe Toronto is a recently opened crêperie in the King Street East/St. Lawrence Market neighborhood. The interior of Crepe TO is narrow but spacious, and one wall is exposed brick with a window at the front where you can see the crepe griddles and crepes are being made. They have 8 griddles and workflow is well organized. The kitchen shelves are lined with large containers of Nutella. They offer both takeaway as well as sit-down service.   Crepe TO offers a variety of breakfast, sweet, savory and signature crepes with very inventive combinations. We ordered both savory and sweet crepes. You can pick from the pre-designed options or you can build your own crepe with whatever filling you prefer. For our savory crepe, we ordered \"Steak and Eggs\" - a crepe from the breakfast menu with egg, roast beef, mushrooms, red onions, green peppers, jalapenos, avocado, havarti cheese, bbq sauce & mayonnaise. For our sweet crêpe, we ordered a strawberry, banana, and Nutella crepe. Crêpe Toronto served an instant winner: a crepe with fresh strawberries and perfectly ripened banana (no need to say much about Nutella). Both crepes were well stuffed with ingredients and the crepe was well made. Their crepes were crispier but slightly thicker than a traditional French crepe. Our orders come to our table wrapped in cardboard sleeve nestled in a metal stand. As you eat your crepe you can tear the sleeve away to reveal your crepe. Certainly, the sleeve is an easy option for anyone on the go.  Several made to order smoothies and juices (with healthy ingredients) are also on the menu. Crepe Toronto doesn't serve coffee or espresso beverages (at least we didn't see any on the menu). We ordered sugar cane juice and an avocado smoothie with almond milk. The naturally sweet and healthy sugarcane juice is made from sugar cane from Costa Rica, squeezed fresh to order using a pressing machine. The juice was refreshing and delicately sweet. However, the avocado smoothie lacked the taste of the main ingredient: Avocados. The nuttiness of almond milk made it nevertheless a decent drink.  Overall, we found Crepe TO a pleasant dining experience. The service was fast and attentive. The food doesn't disappoint you. The music was upbeat but not too loud so you can enjoy your meal and have a conversation. In my opinion, Crepe TO does deserve a repeat visit."}
{"text":"Great crêpes and great staff! We had the salmon crêpe. Really good. Staff was really nice. Tried a sample of sugarcane juice."}
{"text":"Really nice place, yummy crepes, and wonderful customer service. The sugar cane juice is a must try!  We tried the savoury crepes and they were really good! Will be returning to try the sweet crepes one day. I did find it to be a bit on the pricey side."}
{"text":"I had a craving for sth sweet for lunch so I decided to crepe up! I got the Mona Lisa (the classic strawberry banana Nutella crepe) and the sugar cane drink with mint and lemon. The crepe was okay but the drink was quite disappointing. The sugar cane drink tasted just like the apple juice from the grocery stores as if they used apple juice to squeeze the juice out of the sugar cane. The added lemon juice and mint did little to boost the taste."}
{"text":"This is a long-overdue review... Crepe TO has the *BEST* crepes in Toronto. In fact, I think they have the best crepes I've ever had!! I've been to Crepe TO about 30-40 times since they've opened and I've never been let down. They have so many unique crepes to choose from - the most stressful part about dining there is trying to choose just one! I always tell myself, \"I'll try that other one next time\". My current favourites are 'Beast' and 'Good Morning TO'. These are the perfect choice for someone who enjoys variety in their meal and who isn't a vegetarian... they're truly scrumptiously delicious!!!   Another reason why I would give Crepe TO 5/5 stars every time is because of the welcoming and genuinely friendly service you receive when you dine in from everyone who works there."}
{"text":"Great place!  - delicious crêpes  - variety - clean - super friendly staff - sugar cane juice will transport you to the tropics"}
{"text":"Visited this place with my wife. We were on vacation in Toronto. She ordered a crepe with fruit in it and had an avacado shake. I had a blueberry crepe with Nutella and a blueberry shake! It's just like the food videos I watch on Instagram! Yummy crepe goodness with the addition of Nutella! Also, there is a wall of Nutella in the little shop! I wish I would've got more pics and video but we choose to eat inside.  It really is a pick up and go type of place, the seats aren't comfortable. The staff was really helpful and friendly. If I'm ever back in Toronto, I'm going to this place again! You should too!"}
{"text":"Tried this place after seeing the yelp reviews while visiting Toronto. It was quite near my hotel. I tried the Strawberry, Banana and Nutella crepe. It was yummy."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff guided me towards the roast beef crepe while debating between the beef and the mortadella, and recommended that I eat the crepe as soon as possible for optimum flavour.  Pretty tasty stuff!  Packaged in an easy-to-eat peelable cardboard wrapper for mess-free eating on the go, but there's also ample, clean and comfortable seating cafeteria-style if you prefer to dine in."}
{"text":"Cashier was very helpful and gave suggestions to what kind of crepe to order. Ended up sharing a roast beef and turkey crepe with my girlfriend which was pretty filling. They give everyone who dines in a glass of water (which is nice for this weather) and checkup on your meal like a dine-in restaurant. They have crepes for breakfast, snacks and dinner."}
{"text":"Fantastic new restaurant at church and king. I have eaten here a few times and i recommend any of their signature crepes or the BLT with avocado added. Their smoothies are also delicious. Friendly staff, clean and great food. What more could you want?"}
{"text":"Best Crepe I have ever had in Toronto! We ordered TFC and Beast (Signature crepes), they were so soft, delicious , juicy and  pretty healthy! The smoothie is fresh and light, good for work lunch! Highly recommend !"}
{"text":"This spot cropped up in the neighborhood  and was on the radar for places to visit. The place is clean and kept spick and span so kudos for that. Menu consists of savory and sweet crepes with a plenty of options on both side and if you don't find a combo you like you can make your own.  Service was friendly which is also great. Now for the main attraction the crepe itself its a bit ho hum. I tried a sweet version and DC ordered a make your own. Now due to the way they serve the crepe the wet fillings would just slide down (they did in case of DC's crepe) The crepe IMO is geared towards the savory items so didn't fare well with the sweet crepes we ordered. I would say 2 stars with a half star bump for service and cleanliness. I might come back to try the savory crepe otherwise there are much better dessert options nearby."}
{"text":"Great place. I got the Nutella banana crepe and it was very tasty. Great costumer service, the owner came and checked on us himself. I would come back if I ever visit toronto again."}
{"text":"Best Crepe I've ever had and the same goes for the strawberry smoothie. Super friendly staff that are happy to guide you through their Sweet, Savory and Signature options. Their Good Morning TO is a great breakfast option."}
{"text":"Lots of variety in crepes- meat and veggie. If not they offer a build your own option - which is actually affordable. I made my own including: tomatoes, hot peppers, mushrooms, black beans, havarti cheese and garlic aioli. YUM. Very good service. Good fresh juices as well like sugarcane. Nice vibe at the place too."}
{"text":"Had a great chicken crepe for breakfast. Huge mix of fresh ingredients included.  Service was extremely quick and friendly.  Would definitely come by here again for a high quality and cost effective sweet or savory crepe."}
{"text":"Ate here last night and enjoyed it. Had a group of 6 and they pushed two tables together for us. We had two vegetarians and one that keeps kosher and they were able to accommodate us. The crepes were served in a style that was new to me but they were fun to eat. The cardboard holders did generate a lot of trash but the waiter came by frequently to remove the trash. Pleasant service but they close at 8 so we couldn't linger around the table. Good flavor and a good value. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Service is Always super great here, the place look nice and the food is really delicious. I also like the way they present the crepe!"}
{"text":"Crepe TO feels like a cross between a creperie and a pizza shop. Pizza shop because of the shape of the crepe, the neat paper packaging, and at times, the fillings. They offer a pretty wide selection of sweet and savory crepes, plus a build-it-yourself option. I picked the signature \"Hell Boy\", which came with spicy salami, hot peppers, mushrooms, red onions, green peppers, spinach, havarti cheese and tomato pesto sauce.   The texture of their crepes is actually a lot harder and crunchier than crepes I'm used to. I'm assuming in order to hold up to its hefty fillings. I actually quite like it - it doesn't get overly filling that way."}
{"text":"Pretty convenient location just off of the Financial District and near the St. Lawrence Market at King and Church. Fairly big space with high/standing tables available, so perfect for a quick bite on the weekday (or weekend) or for studying!   Tip: No utensils or plates here, so if you wanna share you gotta get creative and messy with your fingers and napkins  I strongly recommend their savory, but not sweet crepes. Vegetarian options are available, but not vegan unfortunately since the actual crepe itself contains butter and eggs. The crepe is a balance between doughy and egg-y. The savory crepes are also kind of oily. Partner and I ordered \"The Leafs\" (1 of 2 savory vegetarian crepes), which contains havarti cheese, avocado, raw mushrooms, spinach, and green peppers, as well as black beans. It's pretty filling, but admittedly I was still semi-hungry after 1 crepe and partner (dude) was still hungry after 1.5 crepes.   I can't speak for their sweet nutella crepes, but I do not recommend the \"Chewy\" crepe, which has bananas, strawberries, cinnamon, and coconut (minus marshmallows by my request). The fruits were fresh and there's nothing off about this option, just that all I could taste was cinnamon, so it was kind of bland.  Smoothies and juices are also available here, but currently they do not serve the carrot or watermelon juices.  Value - 3/5. Prices per crepe are around $10, which in my opinion is way too much. But can't beat the friendly service and convenience. Also imo Crepe T.O. is wayyyyy better than Crepe Cafe on Queen St."}
{"text":"Came back for a friend's birthday during lunch and now I've tried the savoury crepes. They are amazing!!! Super delicious and fresh ingredients and delicious crepe base as expected. I never thought I would enjoy a savoury crape but this place definitely blew my mind and tastebuds! We went during lunch so there were a lot of people and it does take awhile, but it's very much worth the trip and inexpensive compared to your regular lunch meal. :)"}
{"text":"This place is so good!! I highly recommend this place to everyone! They offer both savoury and sweet crepes as well as fresh juices! We ordered the Beast (because I was feeling something spicy) and the Oven Roast Turkey. The crepes were made quickly and comes in these ingenious holders that have tabs to rip open when you get closer to the bottom so you don't need a fork and knife to eat these! We took it to go because well.. you can - with the holders!! Super easy! The Beast was delicious and had spicy salami and roasted chicken with avocados, havarti cheese and garlic aioli..yum... The Turkey one also had avocados, bacon strips, pickles, cheese and dijon mustard. The owner was there and was super friendly when we were chatting with him. I would definitely come back and try everything else on their menu as these two items were amazing!!"}
{"text":"If you would like to see a full food review of how it's made here: https://youtu.be/pc6JKo5Yhlo Your first move in this place should be the Beast. It's tastes like a delicious Panini with a low sweetened Crepe as the bread. They have great vegetarian options and desserts as well. The hidden surprise is the place has beer and Caesars. So if you want to enjoy a drink and a crepe, it is an option. Crepes to go at Crepes T.O.."}
{"text":"WHOA!!! Love this new crepe shop!  Never thought a crepe place could be this modern and clean. Got a savory crepe for each of us, and we were not disappointed. It was easy and mess-free to eat a crepe out from a paper cone. Their website has a full menu from savory to sweet crepes as well as drinks including freshly squeezed sugar cane juice and smoothies etc. You can also make your own by choosing protein, veggies, cheese, and sauce for your crepe. Very reasonable price for what you get. If you want to grab a quick bite in this area, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Delicious crepes, great service ! I had the Madagascar and it was soooo savory! It was yummy and filling."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, fresh crepes! The location is prime, right in the heart of downtown Toronto! The ambience is absolutely amazing, and the interior is so classy and beautifully designed! Definitely a regular spot to visit! Obsessed with Crepe TO"}
{"text":"The Charlie was very large and stuffed full of deliciousness. The waiter was attentive and friendly, with some great tips for me as a first-time visitor to Toronto. I liked the modern decor and welcoming atmosphere. I'd definitely go back next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"This is probably the best nutella Crepes that I ever eat in my life.  Really nice place with so many options and normal prices."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Enjoyed the heavenly crepe - made in front of me. Staff were friendly, the food scrumptious and unique. I want to try the sugarcane juice next!"}
{"text":"Great menu and staff is friendly. Crepes were delicious and will definitely visit frequently in the future."}
{"text":"Standard crêpes but love the packaging it comes with. You can unwrap your crêpe little by little while you are eating it. Very convenient and I didn't get any nutella on my fingers as I would usually do.  Service was great!"}
{"text":"Very friendly and patient staff! The way the crepe was wrapped was very innovative and you can peel the packaging piece by piece as you eat. You can take the crepe to-go or sit in a traditional restaurant setting.   I ordered the Berry World sweet creep and shall I say, it was very fruity and delicious. There was the perfect amount of nutella inside the crepe as well as a great balance between the strawberries and blueberries.   My only complaint would be that the place had no wi-fi to connect to. Also a fair warning to those who eat slow: the crepe is fairly hot so the nutella melts very quickly and could drip all over your fingers if you don't eat quick enough!"}
{"text":"I dined in at Crepe T.O. a week or two ago. It was a late lunch on Friday, so when I entered the store it was pretty empty. This was my first time so I didn't expect it to be a \"restaurant\" in the sense that there is seating; I thought it was a grab and go kind of place.   The restaurant itself is very clean and nice. The service was very good too, they offered me water and checked up on me when I had my crepe.   I ordered one of their signature crepe, the Beast: Oven roast chicken, spicy salami, green peppers, avocado, lettuce, tomatoes, tomato pesto, garlic aioli, and havarti cheese. This was $13 before tax.   It was a tasty crepe. The crepe was cooked fresh and held all of the fillings well. The salami had a little heat which was nice. Overall, the flavour combination worked. The crepe was served in a crepe box and made it very easy to eat (see pictures) - none of the filling fell out. The crepe was quite filling too.   I find the price to be a bit high."}
{"text":"You gotta eat here. lol Lots of choices wether you are having breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert or snack. The sugar cane juice/smoothie is a must have."}
{"text":"Super chilled spot. Love the fact that you can build your own crepe. I ordered a crepe with black beans, avocado, red onions and chipotle mayo. It took a little over 5 mins for it to reach our table. Each bite was flavorful and all the ingredients was fresh. In total it cost about $5 to build that crepe. Decently priced, you can get their special made crepes from $7 to $14. They offer savory crepes, signature crepes, breakfast crepes, sweet crepes and build your own. Additional toppings are not too costly, free to $1.00 each.   If you feel for something that fits a liquid diet, they do make some awesome smoothies and juices. Check it out. The customer service is excellent  too.   I only wish they had more options for toppings for their sweet crepes."}
{"text":"Really great vibe and delicious crepes.  We came in wanting savory crepes and enjoyed them so much that we ordered a dessert one to go. For sure coming back again."}
{"text":"This place was really great for savoury and sweet crepes! Service was VERY FRIENDLY (seems like a family thing), and quick. They have a good selection of savoury and your standard sweet crepes with a couple of different ones.   I got got the nutella and strawberries, my friends got the nutella, bananas and strawberries, and one savoury one with the salami, mushrooms, tomatoes, cheese and other things. They were all super full to the edges, which was a nice surprise. The crepes are all hot and super fresh.   One fun difference is that they come in these \"Easy to eat\" crepe sleeves, so this place is optimized for to go, or a quick bite kind of place.   Definitely a great place for all your crepe cravings, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Hands down best crepe in Toronto. What stood out for me was the quality of the ingredients, and the crepe itself, which is cooked to perfection. The menu is very unique with a wide selection. Both the savoury and sweet crepes are delicious, however what really stands out is the savoury crepe sandwiches, which are loaded with fresh ingredients like arugula, salmi, havarti cheese, etc. Makes for the perfect lunch or dinner. The presentation of the crepes and the service is also top notch. The restaurant itself has a cool modern vibe. Highly recommend trying this place!"}
{"text":"I am not sure what is better, the crepes or the staff. All I can say, is that once we got our crepes the conversation stopped. My fiancé and I didn't look up from our crepes  until there was nothing left. The Beast is amazing. The sweet crepes are perfect. The staff is great. We drove up from Buffalo, and will make this a regular stop."}
{"text":"Lots of flavours/combos to choose from, sweet to savoury. The crepe was so big that it was bigger than my face. And it was so delicious that even when I was feeling full, I kept stuffing more in my face until I finished the entire thing!!  Also got their new avocado smoothie...SO GOOD!!! People who work here are also super nice. Will be back."}
{"text":"Amazing crepes and friendly service. Reasonable prices for the size and amount of food you get. Will be going there regularly!"}
{"text":"I am definitely not a crepes person but the crepes here totally made me fall in love with it!! Strongly recommended. Best crepes ever! Oh the sugar cane juice is so damn good too..!"}
{"text":"My favourite place to get savoury crepes!   I tried their roast beef crepe. The crepe itself was very chewy and soft. Lots of toppings and meat wrapped inside. The crepe was so big and filling!!! I still managed to finish it cause it was too delicious!   The have plenty of crepes to choose from. Will definitely go back for more.  Service is superb - the staffs are very kind!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, lots of space and great ambiance. It's more like a fast food restaurant so don't come here if you are expecting a sit-down/comfortable dining experience. Everything is A-ok. We Ordered the Beast savory crepe which was highly recommended by one of the staff. I guess it's just me? I thought the salami and whatever sauce they were using was way too salty and I think I drank two big glasses of water while I was eating the crepe. The crepe itself is more on the thicker side which I am not a huge fan of. Otherwise, it's basically a fun and different way of having your regular deli sandwiches.   I appreciate the idea of the restaurant but overall, I was expecting a more delicate and interesting menu with creative fillings than just some deli/ham and shredded lettuce.   Overall: 3/5 Service: 5/5 Portion: 4.5/5 (huge portions) Value: 3.5/5 (10-15$ before tax) Ambiance: 5/5"}
{"text":"The crepes here are delicious! I got the savoury German salami crepe and it was full of flavour and fresh ingredients. My boyfriend got a sweet crepe called the Chewy Crepe. Both of them were so good! The restaurant itself is laid back and very clean. The owner and the staff are super friendly and very helpful with the menu and how to actually eat the crepes! We will definitely be returning to try all the other options they have"}
{"text":"Happened to crash this place for a team lunch outing. They have a Tuesday special for their savory selection which is crepe + eska bottled water for 10 CAD + HST. The food is really good! Ordered the ovenroast chicken crepe. I gonna be back."}
{"text":"This is a must try! Not as busy as it should be at lunch (which is good for me!) but this place has developed a great concept for a fun eats! Sweet or savoury it has both. My favourite is the smoked salmon crepe! Mmmm!!"}
{"text":"Crepes are awesome. Wife had a combo of the breakfast and BLT while I had the Cloud 9 (Nutella and Bananas). Staff is friendly. Service is fast. Very clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, fast and friendly service, and food to die for. All this at an affordable price. You can't go wrong grabbing a meal here!"}
{"text":"Greeted with a friendly smile. I had the Madagascar... wow! Plus, they served it in a creative little paper cone. Perfect for a walking lunch."}
{"text":"Yummy.  Liked the fresh ingredients and the fact the crepe is hand made on the spot.  Good atmosphere.  Welcoming staff.  I would go back."}
{"text":"The one love crepe is yum. Not sure how i feel about eating a crepe in a cone but delicious none the less. Very quick and pleasant service also!"}
{"text":"Awesome crepes. Exceeded my expectations. Definitely worthwhile if you are looking for something tasty, either savoury or sweet, that can be enjoyed both sitting or on-the-go thanks to its portable cone-style!"}
