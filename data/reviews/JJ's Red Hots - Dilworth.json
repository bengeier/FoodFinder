{"text":"Finally got around to visit JJ's over the weekend and had the Chili Cheese Coney with onion rings. For a place that prides itself on its hot dogs, it is good that they are so delicious. The hot dogs have a great charred, right off the grill taste. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"For a restaurant that specializes in hot dogs, this place just doesn't deliver.  I ordered a custom dog: a simple hotdog with chili, onions, and mustard.  The chili was sparce and pretty much just tasted like water.  The actual weiner didn't seem to be of high quality and was flavorless as well.  Mustard on top was applied with a very heavy hand. Onion rings were greasy and no surprise here...not much flavor.  Save your money--you can get a better hotdog at a ballgame.

Great location and atmosphere.  Just wish the food lived up to the rest of the restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by JJ Redhots. I went, Groupon in hand, expecting to have a hot dog, only to find myself distracted by the big selection of  dogs and sausages. I was intrigued by the salmon \"sausage\" sliders on the menu, and decided to go with them.  They arrived quickly, served on buns with a tasty mayo sauce. The salmon burgers themselves were nicely seasoned. For a side I chose a salad, which was also very fresh and tasty. My lunch companion had a hot dog and chips for a side, which she said were very good. I would definitely come back! Prices are very reasonable, and there is a wide variety on the menu to suit many tastes."}
{"text":"First off, if you're looking for a good, healthy meal, then this is not the place for you. As advertised; it's hot dogs. Sure, hot dogs with all different toppings, but hot dogs nonetheless.

As expected, it's a totally casual place. You order at teh counter, and then they bring your order to your table. The booth we sat in, however, was totally weird. On the side I was sitting in, it was a normal sized booth, that could fit 2 people, but no more. But the side my husband sat on was about a half of a booth, so that only he would have been able to sit on that side. Weird, and kind of awkward.

I ordered the \"No. 1\" - which is topped with chili relish (which I love whenever I can get it), mustard, onions, and a pickle spear. It really was a pretty good hot dog. The pickle spear made it a bit difficult to eat (it pushed the dog out of the bun), but I just kept mashing it back in after each bite. I was not, however, thrilled with the bun; plain, like from a grocery store shelf, cold, and kind of doughy.

My husband ordered the Cheese Coney, and I had a bite of that, too. That one was also pretty good; topped with chili, cheese and onions. 

The 2 of us split an order of their homemade chips, and there were more than enough to share in that order. This was probably my favorite part of the meal. The chips were hot and crunchy and had a cool dipping sauce to go with it. My husband puzzled (a few times), about why they didn't even have fries available. I didn't really care, and I like the chips, but I do agree that a lot of people probably would like some fries with their dog.

I also enjoyed the small bar that had some free extras, like ginger carrots and pickled vegetables. I munched on those while we were waiting for our dogs to arrive. This was a really inexpensive, enjoyable lunch (I think it cost $11 for the both of us), and a good family place. I'm a little baffled at some of the excitement that I've read in the other reviews, because, I mean, I just can't get that excited about a hot dog, even if it's good, but I'd go back every once in a blue moon for a cheap, quick, yummy, totally unhealthy lunch.

There's not much else to say; other than: hot dogs."}
{"text":"This is one of my absolute favorite places to eat in Charlotte.

I am not adventurous when it comes to food, but I tried several of their signature hot dogs and they were all amazing.

Their cheese fries are delicious. 

I recently became vegetarian and thought that I could no longer eat here, but it turns out JJ's has an option for veggie dogs!!!  Now I love this restaurant even more for having a vegetarian option!!!"}
{"text":"The hot dogs here are awesome! They have a great variety of unique toppings and of course the basics for those who prefer to keep it simple. The prices are also reasonable with meal combos and deals on Tuesdays (and other days, I believe). Don't forget to sign up for the rewards program! The service here is a step above the rest - truly great! They were extremely nice and attentive and happy to answer any questions. We will be back- next time at night so that we can take advantage of their great beer selection!"}
{"text":"An epic lunch spot hidden in Dilworth! My boyfriend and I love going when we want a treat. They really have epic food and service. They make all of their sausages in-house and you can taste the difference. A great atmosphere and place to grab a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"By far one of the best hot dog restaurants i have ever been to! That simple! The menu offers something for everyone and the roof top seating is enjoyable on nice days. This is definitely a place to try."}
{"text":"On Tuesday after 3 hotdogs are 2 dollars we got the char heel was good a lot mustard  I think next time I will add my own mustard .. onion rings are amazing a must item to get .. the tarter tots are good too . Nice quiet little place . oh and they have daft beer"}
{"text":"Just a great place. Onion rings are awesome, hot dogs are perfect. They have great staff. You have to give this place a try."}
{"text":"I went to the East Blvd location and the hotdog was very hard and burned and the onion rings were limp and swimming in grease in the basket. These people don't know how to cook and I will NEVER return.  The staff was not at all friendly."}
{"text":"back for seconds a few days later.... love the food and design
but wish they would lose the styro foam... not an eco-nazi....
just don't like it !"}
{"text":"I was torn between two and three stars, but I want this place to succeed so I'm going to give it three with a qualifier that 3 is extremely generous.  Pros:  the room, the bathrooms, etc. are well decorated and clean.  It's clear that the new owner has gone to great lengths to upfit his restaurant.  The staff seems friendly and nice.  There's even a take out window (which is opening \"soon\")  and a rooftop deck that show promise.  
Cons:  the food is just OK and not memorable.  We ordered Coney dogs. First of all, the hot dogs are grilled--the skin on ours was overcooked and crunchy.  Since we were there in the middle of the afternoon and the place was clearly overstaffed, we couldn't figure out why we'd be served our hot dogs cooked this way unless it was intentional.  Secondly, if there was any chili our hot dogs, we couldn't taste it.  Very, very bland.  Thirdly, no french fries??? Seriously??? How is that even possible?  The onion rings were decent, but would have been much better if they had been accompanied by some ranch dressing--or anything to give them flavor.  
I mentioned my thoughts to the manager who said he'd pass the information along.  Maybe we will give JJ's another shot in a few months after they've worked out the kinks."}
{"text":"This is where I always meet my sister and nephews for lunch!  Birthdays, days off, and of course, a char-heel. No sentence required there, it speaks for itself. Great hot dogs and local beers make for a Charlotte staple. Been to both--Dilworth and Ballantyne."}
{"text":"My hot dog is always so good when I get one here! It's always perfectly grilled so it has that snap when you bite into it and then middle is just delicious and juicy and pink. I really like the potato buns, and I always get a side of french fries, and they're always so good! I want to try the onion rings, but maybe next time! I really love the atmosphere, the people are always nice and helpful, and if it's a great warm day sit upstairs, outside!"}
{"text":"How do you go to JJ's Red Hots without getting a hot dog?! That's me. I did that. I got the Smoked Salmon Sliders and they were \"okay.\" I was not mind-blown like I was looking forward to being, but they were good sliders. They also had good customer service. Next time (because I will be coming back) I will get a hot dog and update my review."}
{"text":"Char heel was my favorite. We went on a Tuesday and hot dogs were buy one get one free! We paid $12 for 4 hotdogs and 2 sides. It was glorious and the food was great. We got the slaw and onion rings as sides, both good choices. We will definitely go back. Oh, and the service was friendly and speedy."}
{"text":"Sweet baby jesus, I finally did it. I found the Holy Grail of the HD world. I consider myself a hot dog connoisseur, and this place is the best in Charlotte. Between the crispiness of the outside, the juiciness of the inside, and that delicious bun...its heaven. Want your mind blown? Get the onion rings as a side and add them to your dog, total mouthgasm. Oh, and the pickle bar. Definitely hit up the pickle bar."}
{"text":"Great options for a low priced vegetarian meal. The veggie hotdogs are absolutely wonderful. They have a self-serve topping section as well with two different types of house made pickles and some pickled ginger-carrots. Don't miss the Ogre sauce that is stored next to the pickles, it's a great tangy barbeque sauce that tastes great on tots."}
{"text":"Ordered some dogs to go (Maui Gold and the Char Heel).  I tried to order the Whistle Pig, but they were out of a key ingredient, so no luck this time.  

Dogs themselves:  Both were very good, but not necessarily great, because, after all, we're writing about hot dogs.  The toppings make or break these things, in my opinion.  The Maui Gold with sweet and tangy pineapple salsa paired with the crisp diced onion and hot dog provided some unique flavors I haven't tasted before.  Buns were fresh.  Two thumbs up. 

Service:  A little bit chaotic, but, this is, after all, their second day in operation, so I'll give them a pass.  There were plenty of staff members around, so it's not like mgmt has tried to cut corners.  They just need to settle into role and responsibilities a little and develop a better understanding of how to interact with customers (I felt like cashier was reading a script and the person handing me my food at the end of the counter was in another world).  I'd also point out the restaurant doesn't seem to flow very well.  Food is being carried by staff members to tables through the crowd of people waiting for to-go orders, which happens to be the same spot as the soft drink machine crowd.  I wish they could have spaced things out a little better.

Price:  Very reasonable.  $3.50 for a dog; add $2.50 if you want onion rings and a drink.  That's cheap by East Blvd standards.

Overall, I think any place with a line extending to the door has something good going on.  I'll be back, hopefully they will have worked out the service kinks by that time.  Dilworth workers just gained another great spot to grab a quick, but decent lunch.  Competition is good for all of us."}
{"text":"Best food in Charlotte!! Get it a try!! Had a couple of dogs and some homemade chips!! Get food and atmosphere!! Owner just shook my hand and thanked us for coming."}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love JJ's!!  Being from Buffalo, NY, it is so nice to have a taste of home every time I go in here (Ted's).  They are super kid friendly, the price is right and you CANNOT beat the food.  The hot relish is to die for, the onion rings are the best, sahlen's hotdogs are like no other and even their fries and chips are great!!"}
{"text":"This eve July 3rd my husband and I ate here.....well tried to eat here.  The hot dogs were served burnt..almost black. We asked if we could send them back for ones that were not burnt. The server was bothered by that, she grabbed it and took off in a huff......like we I was  a real imposition.  The real imposition came when roaches appeared crawling on the wall above our table.  When our food came we could not eat it.  I thought if there are roaches on the walls in the dining area...the kitchen must be crawling with them. It was disgusting."}
{"text":"This place has great hot dogs. I really liked that they offer veggie dogs, which is AWESOME! Because of this, I will definitely come more often. 

The staff was very helpful on explaining their different kinds of hot dog style choices and sides."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times with my husband, and we really enjoyed it. It has an excellent location right off of East Blvd in Dilworth. The hot dogs are very good, and the menu has a lot of toppings to choose from. For my taste, these are the best hot dogs in Charlotte. We both had the Chili Cheese Coney and the dog itself has a lot more flavor than the typical dog. They grill it right there and the chili and cheese are very well balanced. The onion rings are terrific. I only wish they had healthy side options like a salad or a cup of fruit."}
{"text":"The vibe in this place to me is what sets it apart from other places. Food I got was just okay, but that's just speaking on two dogs I ordered.  The menu had a lot of different toppings and it was hard for me to chose, so I just took the workers recommendation. This is a place you should experiment with if you really like hotdogs and feeling a little adventurous. Something different from your average burger joint in my opinion."}
{"text":"I live in the dilworth neighborhood, and was very excited for the opening of JJ's.  It was a beautiful evening so, we went in ordered dogs, fries and beers and told them we wanted to sit on the roof.  They told us to go up, after about ten minutes I went in to check on our beer.  They were sitting on the counter and I was told they had forgotten about them and apologized.  I took the beers and went back on the roof.  In a few minutes two delicious hotdogs and fries arrived, I aske for a napkin ans the server directed me to downstairs, so I went and got napkins.  We ate the hot dogs and half way thru ran out of beer, no server in sight, and I had laready closed out my cc, so we finished our hot dogs and fries, and left heading somewhere else for a beer and an appetizer.

Beverages are the cash cow, had we had a server on the roof we would have ordered more dogs and more beer.  Figure out the service, we want to come back."}
{"text":"This palce is really good, They have a big menu and everything is great. If You like hot dogs this is the place for You"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! 

We go there all the time. Everything on the menu is good. Never a disappointment. I have tried both locations in Charlotte and will continue to go. Great service and great options. Onions rings are amazing."}
{"text":"JJ's is definitely in the hot dog kingdom! I am use to the all beef Nathan or Sabrett NY hot dogs but I can always chow on a good Chicago dog too! I love that JJ's pickles their condiments and there is always a variety of pickled condiments to choose from. Their fresh seasoned onion rings are to good to miss! They do a check in special where you can receive a free order of onion rings!  Be sure to check them out. Dogs and sausages are nicely char grilled. Buns always toasty. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I hired JJ's mobile trailer \"Frank the Tank\" for a birthday party and it was fantastic.  The quality of the food was great and the customer service was top notch.  The 2 guys who worked the event were fun and did a great job at the event.  We chose a wide variety to suit everyone's taste (red hot, brat, hot dog and chicken) and it was all delicious.  I would have them come cater my event again, it was an all around very good experience."}
{"text":"Best hotdog(s) I've ever had. The toppings are phenomenal. The space and design details are great and the concept (once the crowds die down a little and some opening kinks are worked out) is perfect for a very fast, very cheap meal. They have 4 taps of local beers, and then a very decent canned beer list (Oskar Blues and the like). 

My only complaint concerns the VERY young (most looked 18 or under), VERY inexperienced front of the house staff. It matters little since its a take-a-number type of place, but the girl taking our order was dumb as a box of rocks and had zero social tact.

Me: \"...and a side of fries please.\"
Her: flatly \"We don't have those anymore.\"
Me: *looks back at the menu* \"....Wasn't your grand opening yesterday? Do you mean you just ran out?\"
Her: \"Ummmm...*stares vacantly* we just like, don't have them.\"
-long pause-
Me: \"Onion rings then.\"

I just thought it was funny. It does nothing to dampen my enthusiasm for JJ's!"}
{"text":"We're Raleigh natives who happen to live for the moment in Charlotte. It took us 3 1/2 years but we FINALLY found a hot dog joint worthy enough to call ours. The Char Heel is my favorite & the onion rings are a dream come true. Thank you, JJ's! I'm bringing a couple of car loads of coworkers from Fort Mill to enjoy your great food again tomorrow! Love it!"}
{"text":"I purchased the Andouille Sausage Po'Boy style.  The sausage was housemade and you could tell it was super fresh.  The onion rings were super crisp.  The fries were good too.  The time I'm in Charlotte I'm going back to try another sausage along with the andouille sausage!  You guys did a wonderful job!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite joints. Don't dis the dawg! 
Clean.
Friendly staff.
The game is on. (No sound though due to lively music playing overhead)"}
{"text":"I've suddenly developed an irrational fondness for hot dogs, and JJ's Red Hots has become my Sistene Chapel for hot dogs. And not just your typical boiled or grilled hot dogs, but hot dogs all dressed up and ready for the big dance. In this regard, JJ's doesn't disappoint. 

I opt for the Chili Cheese Coney - chili, cheddar cheese, and onions - and the Whistle Pig - bacon, cheddar, onions, mustard. All this with a grilled Sahlen's frank, and you can't go wrong. I can't go wrong. If you don't want one of their signature dogs, no problem, you can build your own. Any topping, go for it!

Great atmosphere, too, tastefully and eclectically decorated. Not only do I enjoy the dogs, I enjoy eating here.

There are plenty of good places to get a hot dog in the QC, but JJ's just might be the best, or at the very least, the most original."}
{"text":"I went to JJ's this weekend for drinks with a large group of people. A few people in our party got hot dogs and seemed to enjoy them. The rooftop seating was pleasant, and there was a girl playing guitar and singing, which was fun.

However, some parts of our experience were rather strange. After a few people asked for Miller and Bud and we realized they didn't have either, we asked for a beer menu. It turns out they serve a lot of local craft beers (yay!), but they had one beer list for the entire rooftop seating area! Our server kept coming up to the table and taking the menu away from us every time she seated a new party so they could look at it. Then the beer list turned out to have factual errors--my boyfriend ordered a beer listed as an ESB on the menu and got quite a shock when they brought out an imperial stout--not what you want when you're sitting outside in 90 degree weather! (Note: this was not an issue of the server bringing the wrong beer--she brought the exact beer we asked for, but the actual menu was wrong!) I applaud the effort to serve nice beer to go with their fancy hot dogs, but if you're going to do so, you need plentiful and accurate menus."}
{"text":"With a menu featuring eight unique chargrilled smokehouse hot dogs from Sahlen's Packing Company in Buffalo, New York it quickly became a daunting task trying to decide what we were going to try first. I figured if the first thing on the menu is named after the restaurant itself.. I'd be doing the world a disservice by not checking it out. So we ordered a JJ's \"No.1? Red Hot Hot Dog, the Chicken and Herb Sausage, Andouille Sausage Sliders, and Onion Rings.

The Chicken and Herb Sausage was very well received at our table and ended up being a favorite of the night. The sausage was cooked to perfection and the toppings were piled high. As for the JJ's \"No.1? Red Hot Hot Dog.. it was good. I guess I didn't realize that the Webers Mustard they use is a horseradish type mustard and not anywhere like the typical French's yellow mustard I'm use too. The first bite sent my nose into hyper drive and my brain scrambling to figure out what had just happened. I cant fault the hot dog for the mustard... there's plenty of people that love horseradish, I'm just not one of them. Without the mustard the hot dog was amazing. The smokehouse hot dogs from Sahlen's were chargrilled, juicy, plump, and full of flavor.

The Andouille Sausage Sliders were also on our favorites list for the night. It came out piled high with andouille sausage, creamy cole slaw, on toasted Martins bun and except for being a little on the messy side was perfect. The onion rings had a mixed reaction at our table. We couldn't decide if the batter needed a new recipe... or if they just needed some ranch to dip them in. The texture was right on point but we couldn't shake an awkward taste after every bite.

JJ's Red Hots also has hand spun milk shakes in four different flavors. We tried the mocha (which was delicious), the vanilla (which was a little on the boring side), and the strawberry (which needed just a little more strawberry). For the most part they were all delicious and well worth checking out.. .especially if the whether stays above 100 degree's like it is right now.

Charlotte is in desperate need of more restaurants serving up incredible food, at a great price, for the average person and JJ's Red Hots hits that mark. In a neighborhood over taken by platinum cards, vip parking, and fancy dining... JJ's Red Hots is a much needed breath of fresh air :)"}
{"text":"I have driven past JJ's so many times and always thought to my self, \"meh, hot dogs.\" Well, finally last night a friend and I stopped in, which completely changed the way that I thought about this place.

You place your order at the counter, they give you a number, and then bring your dogs out to you when they are ready! We sat on the rooftop deck, which was just a relaxing space!

As my husband and I are trying out a vegetarian lifestyle for a while, I was super excited to see Veggie Dogs on the menu. I got the Sonoran Dog and my friend got the chicken tenders with fries. The fry order was definitely big enough to split! The Sonoraran veggie dog was awesome! Salsa, beans, slaw, and some cream sauce. Honestly, couldnt even tell it was a veggie dog! Oh and that red bbq-like sauce in the container on the counter is super legit and awesome to dip fries into!

They have beer bottles and a few draft beers. I was able to get a Noda Jam Session on draft!"}
{"text":"SOOO GOOD and such kind staff! I didn't realize how many different menu options they had but there are plenty of delicious hot-dog combos, chicken, sandwiches, etc! Everything looked so good and the guy taking our order was just so sweet. He gave great recommendations, was knowledge about the menu, listened to us and just overall made the experience enjoyable. They also have a \"pickled veggie bar\" that is free. Delicious! Lots of great history with this locally sourced, family owned restaurant!"}
{"text":"Love this place for the food, atmosphere and customer service. I make sure when I visit the Queen city I come by for a dog and onion rings. JJ's put Atlanta's Varsity to shame. The hot dogs and onions rings are a 100% better than The Varsity. I hope they come  to the Atlanta area one day."}
{"text":"I love these hot dogs. This place has a great vibe and feels like a real neighborhood spot. I reccommended to a friend who just moved here and he goes multiple times a week."}
{"text":"Stopped in on several recommendations and I'm glad I did.  Nice no tension environment.  I had the Chili Cheese Coney combo and it was great, the price was right as well!   Thanks JJ!"}
{"text":"We went to JJ's on a Saturday night and it was definitely busy. I ordered the Maui dog with onion rings. I enjoyed the pineapple salsa, but the onions were on overload.  Although the onion rings were a little on the greasy side, the spices and flavoring was delicious. There was a definite spice to the rings that built up over time. The hot dog was very good and we will definitely be coming again.  Can't beat a great hot dog with great prices.

The space looks great, parking lot is annoying."}
{"text":"Okay hotdog. Casual atmosphere. Individual dog prices are okay; \"combo\" price was a little high for what you get. Will try it again though."}
{"text":"Great food, but please don't lock your doors at 7:40 when you advertise being open until 8pm. I made a special trip for JJ's only to be met with a locked door and no notice of the change or practice.  Disappointing.  I'll definitely think twice next time I want a hot dog."}
{"text":"Had the \"dog walks into a bar\" dog. The beer cheese and pretzel roll compliments the great dog perfectly. Onion rings are great."}
{"text":"JJ gives me my hot dog fix every time and wouldn't have it an other way! I go with the Char-heel which is very simple but my favorite!! From the chili, the mustard, the onions, even the bun! This hot dog is every hot dog lovers dream! if that's not enough convincing for you wait until you try the onion rings I don't even know what other side options there are because I cant get away from those dang onion rings!! Those little strings of love will have you drooling for more, guaranteed! No JJ's visit is complete without the infamous Ogre sauce of course. This sauce paired with those onion rings are a match made in heaven! They sell it by the bottle. Buy some. You're welcome. They have a pickle bar too where they have a number of different pickled toppings. My absolute favorite are the spicy pickles I make sure to leave with a few of those for the road! JJ's is family friendly so bring everybody! Hands down the best hot dog place in Charlotte, its sure to please!"}
{"text":"Let's just cut to the chase. I was not incredibly impressed. We went to check it out last night since we have been craving a good hot dog. We left still craving a good hot dog. 

The Coney Dog looked great but was bland, and the onion ring batter turned too hard when fried. I actually was concerned that it may crack a tooth. The Andouille sliders are a rip off. Twice the price of a regular dog and less than half the meat. The amount of meat in each of the 2 sliders was less than a single Little Smokie link. Basically tasted like mayo and bread.
The food isn't horrible, just not great. I won't be rushing back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Had the famous JJs signature all beef hot dog with chili and it fixed my craving bc I wanted a hot dog. 

It was great to have  friendly staff and service. #goodvibes"}
{"text":"2nd time visiting the restaurant, I liked it a lot more this time. Got the Chili Cheese Coney. Could have used some more chili but hotdogs were over bun size.  Fries were good.  Good spot for lunch or for casual hangouts."}
{"text":"Great food. Fantastic upper patio area. Good bang for the buck. Convenient parking. Must go."}
{"text":"This is a popular place with locals to satisfy the urge to have a good hot dog.  The only problem is choosing which one you want as the choices for dogs and side items are considerable.  It was quite crowded as it was Fathers' Day and all dads got a free hot dog.  Thanks to my son's girl friend, we had coupons to use also.  Your order and payment is taken at the counter.  You are given a number, find a place to sit and your food is delivered to your table.   There's a pickle bar and next time, I plan on seeing what that is all about. I was pleasantly surprised to find that Cheerwine is on the drink menu.  I live in PA and it is not available.  
  Great place to stop by."}
{"text":"My wife and I just stopped by for lunch on a Monday around lunch time. They have easy parking and it's right in the heart of Dilworth. 

Food was awesome! I ordered a special that had pimento cheese, bacon, Carolina slaw and blonde mustard. My wife had a dog with ketchup and onions which she also loved. 

They have a really casual atmosphere which is great for lunch. It took us less than 30 minutes to order, eat and get back to the car so great spot for a quick bite or a sit down."}
{"text":"I won't dive too deep into the aesthetics of the place since others have covered it well, but suffice it to say the place looks great and the patio upstairs is a nice place to enjoy some tube-steak...As for the edibles, they're serving Sahlen's hotdogs from NY, which are solid.  They're not huge, but they're quality so that's what counts.  (They do serve the same brand next door at Lebowski's) They have the obligatory selection of pre-designed topping dogs, and sausages, as well as some other munchies like chips and salads, but we didn't try any of those.  You can also build your own dogs too if you want.  They also have an all you can eat hot dog buffet sometimes, and it was only $5 so if you can hit that up, it's a crazy deal. I think I had 6 the last time we went, so you can get your money's worth!  All in all, a cool vibe, if a little pricey, but I think it's worth it."}
{"text":"Pros: It's really good. 
I tried \"salmon sausage\" for the first time and said \"mmmm this is really good.\" Out loud. Uncontrollably. Embarrassingly. 

They are creative and unique. I like it. 

The staff are very always very friendly every time I've been there. 

The prices are good. They have cool license plates everywhere. Guitars too. 

Cons: Turning left out of that parking lot is impossible during weekday lunch hours. We turned left once when we probably should have waited more and a smart car came screeching to a halt in a very overly exaggerated manner, the driver clearly cursing and upset. The car kind of skipped a little.. a cute little hop, like a bunny. 
Normally I would feel bad but it was all so adorable that I just couldn't help but give him a big smile. 

Their sauce bottles are always clogged."}
{"text":"My family & I stopped by today 6/23/18 and it was not too busy. We skipped the uptown location because of parking. We ordered the CharHill, the Legend, build- your-own, and uptown- downtown dogs. We also had a side of corn dogs bites, tater tots & onion rings. We spent approx $43 and the food was very disappointing.
It was our first time visiting after seeing on Diners, Drive-in, and Dives. I must say the onion rings were very good and that's it!
The corn dogs were greasy, the sauerkraut tasted old, the cole slaw and chili just seemed flavorless. We really expected more from this restaurant but for us, we will not be returning. Also the guy that added the toppings to the order didn't have on a hair net for his beard and as we left, he was drinking a water bottle in the same location where the food was being bagged (near the food lamp).
Yes all workers should take breaks, but away from the food being served."}
{"text":"People that love Hot Dogs love this place.  I had their brat dog and it was one of the best I have had in a long time!
Try It"}
{"text":"Delicious! Soooooooo good! When I say this, I don't mean meh, these hotdogs are good (ish). They're the bomb! So many choices! The pricing is spot on and not too expensive but not so cheap that you think they bought ingredients at the dollar store. Don't get me wrong, I love the dollar store but not for food! ;) Hubby and I ate here with friends and we all had a great experience! Good atmosphere, family friendly, and quick service!"}
{"text":"Yum!!!! I had a southern girl dog with pimento,Cole slaw, bacon and sauce. Holy Wah! It was delicious coupled with thin and crispy onion rings and cheerwine soda.  My counterparts also tried the specialty dogs with tater tots and no complaints were voiced. The service was fast and pleasantly efficient. Very noisy so we ate in the deck in the sunshine. Could be a little cleaner but I'm sure with the amount of people coming in that it is hard to keep up. A great lunch indeed."}
{"text":"We had dinner at JJ's Red Hots last night and were not disappointed.  It was our first visit to the restaurant.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  They offer a good variety of hot dogs and sausage.  We enjoyed the \"JJ's Redhot,\" \"Dirty Jerz,\" and \"Charheel\" hotdogs.  They have a bit of whimsey in naming their hotdogs to match specific U S states.
The restaurant is exceptionally clean with a health rating of 101.  Plus, the design of the restaurant is quite comfortable and pays homage to The Drum restaurant that occupied the space many years ago.

We look forward to returning to JJ's and trying their other hot dogs."}
{"text":"I wanted to share that after my posted review, the owner of JJ's (\"Jonathan L\") chose to send me an email filled with sarcasm, condescension, and ridicule.  That's fine.  That's his prerogative.  Now it's my prerogative to never visit JJ's again, not only for the items mentioned in my review, but for his unprofessionalism as a business owner.  

He feels that I should reward his workers going above and beyond their regular duty.  To me, that's just called doing a great job.  I, too, go -- and have gone -- above and beyond in all of my jobs -- retail, restaurants, offices.  It's who I am.  I don't expect a tip for treating someone extra special or making their day.  Just doing it is reward enough.  Plus, I'm already being paid to provide good service by my employer(s).  That's why I was hired.

Jonathan also wanted to \"explain\" to me the difference between \"fast food\" and \"fast casual,\" since I apparently didn't get it.  Oh, I get it.  He suggests that they not only prepare my food and ring me up, they deliver it to my table.  Wow.  Well, that deserves an extra special bonus, right?  Meanwhile, I have to select the least dirtiest table in the dining room because nobody's out there cleaning them off.  Nobody checks up on me at my table afterwards.  Nobody refills my drink.  Nobody takes my trash away for me.  I left a 20% gratuity on the bill I signed at the register.  Where was the \"exceptional service\" and employees going \"above and beyond\" for that?  

So, no thanks, Jonathan.  I'm not going to pay extra so your employees can treat me like a customer.  Just visiting your establishment should grant me that."}
{"text":"Great hot dogs. I tried the Maui and Dirty Jerz. I'd probably say the Maui was the better of the two but they were both high end wieners. They really pile on the condiments at this place and they also have a mini condiment stand where you can add extra jalapenos and vinegar soaked veggies and such. The hot dogs themselves are kind of a \"mild\" red hot so they don't completely destroy your insides. The setup in here for ordering is kind of like a stand in that you don't have a server. You just order, they give you a number and run the food to you when it's ready. They do have a pretty decent beer selection as well even though it is limited. The whole meal cost me around 13$ for two hot dogs and a beer so I'd say it's a little on the pricey side for a lunch. All of the staff was very friendly. Oh yeah, we tried the house chips which were the \"potato chip\" style and they were good but nothing to really write home about."}
{"text":"Love coming here, its like going to Teds back in Buffalo and they have the #1 combo which is the same thing i would get in buffalo with everything on the dog with webersmustard."}
{"text":"I have been craving for a good hotdog for a long time now. And I didn't want just any hotdog. I heard about this place through Insta & been dying to go. 

Finally, after finding some free time. I decided to go & my family tagged along. We all tried a different hotdog, each were incredibly delicious!!! It definitely satisfied my overdue cravings. I had the Southern girl hotdog & I can't complain ! It has a nice kick at the end ! 

The menu is a good size & easy to read. * They have Private Parking which makes it convenient. *Their place isn't too big, just enough space for everyone to feel relaxed. * It is very colorful inside with the music not being too loud. So you can carry a full conversation. * The staff is very friendly. 

Didn't get to try anything else but their hotdogs - JJ's was not a disappointment at all !! Check their place out if you are ever near the area !! (:"}
{"text":"Favorite hot dog in Charlotte. If I hadn't lived in Chicago previously, I might say my favorite hot dog place ever. I love the atmosphere both inside and out, but you can't beat the rooftop deck. With this building's bad reputation for keeping tenants, I hope JJ's can make it for the long haul. I'm a big fan."}
{"text":"***This review is for Sausage Fest 2014***
Had a GREAT time!! All you can eat sausage and BEER!! Had Elk, Italian, Oriental(w/shrimp!) , Lamb and Turkey sausage.Tasty sauces/condiments to go with each..All very good, my top 2 favorites were the Oriental and Italian..Also had a pepper jack Brat w/ coleslaw..One of the highlights which did run out was a chowder..WOW!! Could have eaten a gallon of that!! Good bands also..Had awesome beers from NODA,  Triple C, Wicked Weed and a few others.  Very friendly staff!!  Good vibes all around.Will go back to the restaurant proper in the future and hope there is a Fest in 2015!!"}
{"text":"I wasnt impressed with the buns, really dry definitely not homeade. Actual dog was great, loved the house relish. But what stole my heart was the french fries...omg they were that crusty texture with just enough softness inside to cant stop eating them. 
Go for the combos!"}
{"text":"Their hot dogs are fantastic and served on delicious potato rolls.  They have a standard menu with lots of really great dogs pre-topped but do tons of specials too. Be sure to grab a card for a tee once you try them all!"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing...My friends know my obsession with hot dogs, some may say its unhealthy and sometimes really weird but hey I just LOVE them!! I came in here a month or so ago and we received burnt dogs that all you could taste was that-i had the Coney Dog and it was not good. We got the Onion rings and they were VERY greasy. Most likely will not be back sorry JJ's I wanted to LOVE you!!"}
{"text":"Soooooo delicious! I ordered the Sonoran Dog and it was tasty!! I also ordered the tater tots, so crunchy and perfect!

Also, the staff was very pleasant and the restaurant itself looked clean. Definitely going back again and trying a different hotdog!"}
{"text":"Interesting spin on hot dogs. I was surprised and happy with what they had to offer. I will most certainly return."}
{"text":"I'm going to rate this place like a Hot Dog restaurant.

If I rated it like a real restaurant, it'd get two stars.

But hey.  If you really want a hot dog...."}
{"text":"Tried JJ's the day after the Grand Opening. Smooth ordering process and solid list of options for dogs. Great interior decor and vibe and best of all--the food was very good.  JJ's has been added into our go-to rotation."}
{"text":"I eat out a lot, work in a restaurant,  and I love hot dogs! But this place didn't seem to hit the spot. I was excited for a hot dog joint. Meh. Not what I expected, the fun upbeat decor and music do not add up to the service, or food.  Here it is a Sunday afternoon, no one is in here. I'll start with the food, I had the JJ no.1 Red Hot. Hot is what it was, spicy and the pickles added an awkward, but good touch. The coleslaw, bland. I think KFC has better coleslaw that what I just ate from here. The beers on draft, all four, are local, NoDa Brews, which are of course yummy. Probably the only thing I enjoyed. Don't get me started on the staff, who weren't so welcoming and seemed bored out of their minds, as they stood there, with the manager I'm assuming, watching tv. All in all, I've had better, nothing special about this place. I give it two stars, ONLY because they had good beers on draft."}
{"text":"Was craving a good hotdog for lunch so stopped in and tried jj red hots. I ordered the coney and my wife had the char heel. The staff is very friendly and the restaurant is clean. But unfortunately the food was just average."}
{"text":"Consistently good and nice, friendly staff. And love a place that has nightly specials!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place...great decor and most importantly...delicious food!

Walked in Saturday afternoon, not really knowing what to expect but was pleasantly surprised with the cool, funky decor and menu board. 


And it didn't hurt that my check in got me some free onion rings...whooo hooooo!

I decided to be my own chef and keep it simple with the Handcrafted dog- I chose deli mustard, onions and sauerkraut. 

I didn't have to wait long and my delicious meal was HOT and ready, the bun was fresh and soft and didn't overwhelm the dog, the ratio of bun to dog was perfect. My dog was cooked perfectly, but I like a bit of char and crunch! The toppings were delicious. Again, not too much to overwhelm, it was just perfect!

I actually enjoyed the onion rings! They were huge, the breading was delicious and crunchy... and super delicious with ketchup.

Overall I was very pleased with my visit, and look forward to going back...I hear there is a dog wrapped in bacon that had my name ALL over it!!"}
{"text":"Lunch there today. Had the brat and tots.  Very good, but left a little hungry.   Expect to pay $10 for a dog, side and drink."}
{"text":"I think my experience was like a lot of others on here.  I was really looking forward to trying JJ's, but was underwhelmed after the meal.

The decor is great and it's a cool spot.  I stopped in after watching my Noles get a win on a Saturday night and the place was dead at 10pm.  I guess a hot dog place is more of a lunch destination, but I thought there might be some other drunken college football fans looking for some food to soak up all the booze from the afternoon.  I kind of got the suspicion it was dead for a reason.....

We tried an assortment of hot dogs, the onion rings, and the nachos.  The nachos were on special for $2 and they were definitely the highlight of the meal!  I was expecting tortilla chips, but they came with crunchy kettle chips topped by beans, cheese, and salsa.  The kettle chips added a nice crunch and stayed crispy even though they were topped with salsa.  The hot dogs were 'Meh'.  First of all, they came with buns that were right out of the bag.  They weren't toasted or steamed or even MICROWAVED.  The hot dogs were also charred black.  I like my dogs crispy, but not completely charred.  Do you need to specify that?  I did order a 'Charheel', but damn.  Maybe they should rename the place 'JJ's Black Hots'.  The hot dogs themselves aren't even that great.  I like all beef dogs like Nathan's, but these tasted like the cheap 'grocery store' brand.  You know what I'm talking about.  The onion rings weren't good either.  They were served cold, but I had already eaten half of the small basket before I thought to say anything.  Remember, I was there after a long day of beer drinking.

There could be some potential here, but I will be going for the more expensive sausages if I make it back.  The hot dogs just weren't that great in my opinion."}
{"text":"Great place, must visit!

My husband and I frequent JJ's 2-3 times a month.  We love the service, the sweet tea and of course the hot dogs!  We can both order the single dog combo with a drink for less than $15- what a deal!  I usually order the Whistle Pig- house-cured bacon (very good!) and lots of shredded cheddar cheese. Yum!  The pototo rolls that the dogs are served on are very soft and are served warm.  Try the Weiner the Pooh dog- peanut butter, honey and bacon.  Trust me, its good!  The sweet tea is awesome but give the OrangeAde a shot, very refreshing!"}
{"text":"I took my brother, nephew, and little cousin here.. It's ok.. Nothing to special I won't give it a bad rating just because it was plain.. The staff was cool and I liked the atmosphere.."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner for the first time. We got two different two dog combos. Dirty jerz, chili dog, Tarheel and quarter hounder. The dogs were perfectly grilled. Chili cheese was awesome and sauerkraut was delicious. Great quality buns. Tarheel was good. We would pass on the quarter hounder next time. Pretty decent onion rings. Lemonade was small and overpriced. Expensive for what you get but delicious nonetheless."}
{"text":"I love JJ's!!! I love the whole concept. I went last night with my husband and a friend, and we each got two different dogs. We were kind of hanging out waiting at the soda machine when one of the guys assured us that he would bring our food, even if we were sitting outside. He did, shortly after. (Confession: I was just standing there so I could keep eating their homemade pickles and picked onions- yum!!). We sat on the rooftop, which was perfect for a nice November evening. After two dogs and a side, we were stuffed. 

I love the fact that this place really tries to incorporate other Charlotte businesses, whether it's local beers or King of Pops, etc. The service has been excellent every time I've been- everyone is super chill and patient, and encourages you to try new things! They have special dogs every week and deals every day but Monday. 

Awesome place for a quick dinner, especially with kiddos."}
{"text":"I've driven past JJ's dozens of times, and it's always seemed incredibly busy. It was such a beautiful day on Saturday I decided to take my dog for a walk through nearby Freedom Park and walk up from the park to grab some lunch. I'm glad we finally decided to try this place! 

My wife got the Dirty Jerz (pickled relish, onions, mustard, & sauerkraut) combo with a side salad. Hers was good (more of a traditional\" hot dog to me), and the balsamic dressing was good! I opted for the Quarter Hounder (queso, bacon, lettuce, secret sauce) with the onion rings. My dog was phenomenal, the sauce/queso had a fantastic taste... The onion rings were okay, but nothing I would call \"infamous\" like they claim. Next time I'll probably opt for the cheese fries. 

Besides the awesome food, probably my favorite things are the cheap prices ($6.99 for any dog, side and drink) and their awesome rooftop seating. We were able to lounge up there with our little pooch and soak up the sun while we chowed down. Definitely a must stop during a jaunt down East Blvd."}
{"text":"So I've been wanting to try this place out for sometime now being that it has such great reviews, and I just love a good hot dog. Was finally in that area, so I thought I would stop by and try it out. The establishment is very clean and the customer service was awesome. I ordered the Char Heel dog, and the Dirty Jerz. The Char Heel dog was ok, nothing to rave about. The relish on the Dirty Jerz was not to my liking nor was the sauerkraut. I actually ended up scraping the toppings off. The actual hot dog had a nice \"char\" but didn't taste like a beef hot dog, which is the type of hot dogs they advertise as using. The most enjoyable part of my meal was the fries which were cooked and seasoned nicely. Overall I'm not sure why their hot dogs get such rave reviews. Maybe Im just picky. With that stated its definitely Not a place I would go to for a good sloppy hot dog."}
{"text":"My first visit here though I've been hearing about their legendary hot dogs for years. Not having one close by my neighborhood was my excuse. Now I know a trip with JJ's as a destination is worth the journey! I was amazed at all of the choices other than hot dogs.  Options included sandwiches and salads as well as some vegan dishes. A wide selection of beer was available also. Back to the hot dogs though I ordered the very popular Char dog with chili onions and slaw period for my side I had the incredible onion rings thinly sliced and crusty. The atmosphere was friendly and the staff was welcoming. We ordered at the counter and our food was brought to us within minutes. I definitely plan to go back on one of their Tuesday afternoons after 3:00 when they serve $2 hot dogs and $2 beer. What a great deal for a week night after work!"}
{"text":"First timer and I enjoyed the fresh-cut fries with vinegar more than the  dog. Lol. The dog was pretty  good, but will  be tastier if I ask for it to be charred more. Good ingredients. Very warm if you dine-in with the open kitchen and 90° weather.  Beware lactose sensitive/vegan  the borracho beans come topped  with cheese. Was unaware  and the menu fails to list;however good after scrapping off  Will be back to try some of the other dogs."}
{"text":"Hot dogs WELL done. It all starts with a potato roll that's soft and sweet. Pick your dog or sausage and then some amazing toppings. I had the  charhill featuring some of the best slaw ever! My husband had a kasekriener with an excellent sausage. Needless to say we will definitely be back here many times."}
{"text":"We stopped by JJ's later in the afternoon on their opening day, which was July 4th.  We were happy to see that the line had died down, because when we passed by the place about an hour earlier, there was a line wrapped around the building.  When we got inside, there was still a line to the ordering counter, but it moved pretty quick.  We were meeting several friends here so a couple of us got in line to order while others got a few tables together for our large group.  I had the bratwurst with sauerkraut and deli mustard, which was awesome, and the wife got the herb chicken sausage added to her salad.  Yeah you heard me right, she got a salad.  She enjoyed her mixed green chopped salad and the balsamic vinaigrette, and the chicken sausage made in-house was awesome.  We also ordered a couple of beer from their four taps.  On tap beers were local NoDa Brewing, OMB and a Foothills IPA. They also serve several beers from cans and red/white wine by the glass.  We also tried some of the dogs and I would need to return to eventually try them all.  Looking forward to getting a whistle pig next time.

The main issue with JJ's, when we were there, was the chaos that was their opening day.  Once the staff has a few shifts under their belts and they work the kinks out, I hope JJ's will be around for a long time.  They offer a very reasonably priced menu for Dilworth and what I assume will continue to be a stellar beer selection.  They also need to figure out a better way to order another beer other than going back up to the counter, especially, if they are planning on having groups of people hanging out at the restaurant."}
{"text":"We have never been here before and as we walked in, there was a menu board with so many hotdogs and sausages it was difficult to pick. 

We had to ask the guy working the register on which was the best. His first pick was the The Char Heel and his second pick was the Chilli Cheese Coney.

We grabbed our fountain drinks and sat down and within a few minutes, our dogs had arrived.  The first bite of the chilli cheese coney was quite good!  I then went on and tried the Char Heel and it too was very good. 

I must say we were impressed with JJ's Red Hots. Next trip into Charlotte and we will come back."}
{"text":"I have nothing but good things to say about this place. I've been several times and it's always a great experience. The hot dogs are incredible & the vibe is always perfect."}
{"text":"You mean you offer vegetarian hot dogs? Yes, I'm down! 

It's often tough to find hot dog venues that offer a veg options, but J.J's does just that! You can sub a vegetarian hot dog on any menu item. Not only that, but their chili is vegetarian as well! The hot dogs are pretty basic, but flavorful none the less. There are a lot of different variety's, or you can just choose your own toppings. So there is something for everyone on the menu. 

Their sides are great! I love the cheese fries! Also the pickle bar is an added treat, with amazing pickles..and even pickled okra...if you are lucky! 

Overall: Good prices, good food, friend/efficient staff, can't complain!"}
{"text":"Best damn dogs i've ever had... i had to have 2.. OK maybe 3..."}
{"text":"My usual suspects (Dion L. & Simone M.), along with my boyfriend & Dion's husband (we were missing Katie M.!) ventured out today to the grand opening of JJ's. We got there at 1:30 & there was already a line at the door!

We got in a little early & checked out the inside...wow! It's really nice inside - check out the drum set \"chandelier\" on the ceiling! The \"pallet\" is clean, nice wood throughout, old black & white pictures on the walls. While it's somewhat small inside, the booths are huge & have plenty of space. They also have table seating & a bar-type island table in the middle. As soon as you walk in, you place your order at the register & pay for you food. The kitchen space is open, somewhat. You'll want to go ahead & get your soft drinks at the fountain & have a seat. They bring your food out to you. 

I settled for the Joilet Jake dog (Chicago style), onion rings, & an orangeade. Keep in mind, if you order an orangeade or lemonade, they make it fresh, so they'll bring it out to your table.

We didn't wait very long until we received our food. Dion got the coney dog & beans, Simone got the Maui dog with fries, while Shawn got the Joliet dog with onion rings & a strawberry milkshake, & Evan got the sausage sliders & slaw. We were all \"oooh-ing & ahhh-ing\" about our choices! The dogs had a nice char to them & all the yummy toppings made the hot dog perfect! The onion rings...ohhhh! They were nicely fried & seasoned with a spicy batter. The orangeade was so refreshing! I would have liked the option to have a larger cup, though. At least with a soft drink, you were able to get free refills.

Other notes: friendly employees, pickled vegetables & jalapeños, Mt. Olive full pickles & Mt. Olive bread & butter pickles are beside the drink fountain. Beware! Those jalapeños are VERY hot! Patio seating outside, as well as deck seating on top of the restaurant.  Their prices are pricey, my entire meal was $10 & some change. 

Their marketing is fantastic! Their social media game (twitter, Facebook, instagram) is on point & they do offer to hold events at the restaurant. They also have cute t-shirts and hats for sale.

Hoping JJ's Red Hots will do well & stay a part of the community. If today was any indication, they're going to be just fine!"}
{"text":"JJ's is not a restaurant.  It's not a hot dog joint.  It's a culinary experience - designed to tickle your taste buds, and key into your other senses in pretty surprising ways.  

Before even getting into the food, it's worth mentioning that everything about the restaurant is well-designed, and gorgeous.  The menus are creative and fun, interior decoration is clever and well-themed, and the layout of the restaurant is stellar -- especially if the weather is nice and you can sit on the rooftop deck!

I LOVE the hot dogs at JJ's.  Truly.  I've had several different combinations of hot dog type and toppings, including some of their crazy dog-of-the-days (The Elvis, for example, had peanut butter, honey, and banana chips on it!).  They're well made, and delicious.  even when there's a line to order, food never takes long.

I will admit that the one thing that's lacking for me is the sides - I've had the beans, fries, onion rings, and chips, and they're all relatively forgettable.  I usually stick to 2 dogs and a drink.  

My favorite hot dog? Rocket sauce, bacon bits, and cole slaw.  Yum.

Keep an eye on JJ's instagram account for specials and contests, too."}
{"text":"Second try wont go back the onion rings still drip in grease . My hot dog was cold and cant see how this place stays in business.  I get a better hot dog at a gas station ."}
{"text":"Ok. After trying several rounds of the \"Dog of the Week,\" I'll sell my soul for another one of them. The varieties that came out of the minds of local beer aficionados like Chris from Good Bottle, Jason from Salud, and dudes from OMB, Birdsong, or Daniel from CharlotteBeer, I'm hooked. It's what I look forward to the most upon each visit. 

Recently, I checked out the dog with peanut butter, sriracha, and bacon. Ummm....yeah. I almost lost my mind it was so good. Anything that even slightly breathes that side of Thai/Vietnamese flavor. 

Also, summertime calls for a nice, tall orangeade. The Arnold Palmer variety is rather refreshing, too. Not too sweet and ever-so perky. 

Winner, winner!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't eat her everyday but when you just need a hot dog this is the very spot you need to go to. Cool selection of side items and they have king of pops which is always a plus"}
{"text":"I was so happy to find this place! They have The same hot dogs I grew up with in New York. And the atmosphere is great. The staff was friendly and my hot dog was delicious. We also got tots and fries and both were crispy and yummy. Parking was a bit hard once it was busy but if you come on an off hour there's tons of parking."}
{"text":"Hot dogs, hot dogs everywhere and also have a drink!

JJ's is a great spot, home to a wide variety of signature dogs, from the Sonoran, with its delicious borracho beans, to the Chicago-style Joliet Jake, to my favorite little slice of hot dog hominess, the Dirty Jerz. Your dog will always have a crisp skin and taste like actual meat, just as it should be. Even next to the delicious hot dogs the sides do not disappoint. Try the sweet potato chips. You'll be hooked. I promise. The house made chips are excellent too and if your dog choice was not so south of the border, don't worry you can get a side of those tasty beans as well.  Top it all off with some selections from their pickle bar.

Now you can have a soda to go with your meal, but you can also have one of the craft beers they have, both on tap and in cans. They always have the local breweries well represented and $3 brew night sweetens the deal even more. If you aren't really in the beer know, the counter staff aren't usually very well versed, but even if you take a wild guess they have enough quality choices that you should be pleased."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place?  I came here when it first opened and frequented it often when I lived in Charlotte. I moved away to tampa but my love for JJ'S never died. Anytime a friend is coming to Charlotte I tell them one place they HAVE to check out is JJ'S! The food is amazing, but what really makes this place is their management!  From the owner Jon Luther (very cool cat) to the staff and the marketing director(Brandy) they love their customers!  I'd give ya 10 stars. Now if I can just get ya to move to Tampa,  I'd be in heaven! I'd even apply to help run it!  Keep up the great work guys and gals"}
{"text":"The Whistle Pig hot dog was really good. The atmosphere was cool but a little bit noisy with the music played over the speakers. Kinda hard to hear my wife and kids at the table. I will definetly come back for more."}
{"text":"JJ's is an awesome place to grab some fun grub and hang out. While the menu appears simple (we are talking hot dogs here), the amount of flavor is not. Also this place has a neat outdoor space and several local beers and desserts to please all age ranges.

I have been here a few times and have enjoyed everything I tried. My most recent visit was to get out, enjoy the sunshine, and eat something other than soup after a bout with the flu. My wife and I ended up getting one of the No. 1 Red Hot, Sonoran, and the special dog of the day which featured candied bacon and pesto. All around, everything was great with the Sonoran taking the crown. I appreciate that they have multiple style dogs that you can mix and match with the menu. I recommend trying the veggie dog as it has become my go to. Pro tip: you can get a free fry when you check in with yelp. This place also serves local beers on tap and don't pass the sauce counter with home-made pickles and ginger soaked carrots. 

My favorite part of this place is the outdoor seating, namely on the roof. Great place to sit and relax with a beer while you watch the commotion on East Blvd wiz by. Also during the summer they have a fair amount of live music. JJ's has filled a void in my life that I didn't realize I had, gourmet hot dogs. I look forward to my imminent return."}
{"text":"jj red hot is a grate place to eat the have lots of different choices . you can get a hot dog or a bratwurst and chicken . the have very good milkshakes and they even have king of pops Popsicle. over all i think jj red hot is very good  to eat at."}
{"text":"This place made my JJ red hot if you know what I mean.  Serious note though, awesome dogs and onion rings were fantastic."}
{"text":"Overpriced if you want a plain dog. I ordered a hot dog, fries, and a lemonade and my cost came up to over $8. Took off the fries bc I really just wanted a hot dog and I still paid over $7. A bit much for a hot dog, I think. The dog was alright- something I should have made in my own oven. And,  I left hungry.  Other than the price, the service was PHENOMENAL! Great staff from entry to departure."}
{"text":"Just smashed a double-dog combo from JJs and boy is my afternoon better.

If you're on the fence between a single dog combo and a double dog, ALWAYS, always, always, ALWAYS go for the double.

You can try out two different dogs and really get the FULL experience.

Being from Chicago, I always get the Joliet Jake. I have very high standards when it comes to a Chicago-Style hot dog and outside from having a different bun, the Joliet Jake is ON. POINT. 

I also tend to get either the Sonoran, or the Char-heel, both great options.

When it comes to sides - I always get fries. I have a guy in my office who LOVES chips, and he raves about their house chips. If you're into chips, get em. If you're not, you're a fool if you don't get the fries. They're ALWAYS crunchy and delicious."}
{"text":"Went here on the 4th of July for a few dogs, and I have to stay, I was impressed.

Due to the fact that I came there at lunch time on the 4th and that it was the Grand Opening, its no surprise that the line was pretty long.  Its set up so you place your order, pay, are given a numbered sign, and your food is brought to you at your seat.

I ordered the Char Heel ($3.49) which came with Chili, Slaw, Diced Onions, Mustard.  I made it a combo and was able to get onions rings which were great, and a refillable fountain drink for an additional $2.49.  I also ordered the The Whistle Pig, which came with house-cured bacon, shredded cheddar cheese, diced onions, and mustard.  

I have to say, it took a LONG time for my two buddies and I to receive our food.  Once again this may be due to the fact that it was the Grand Opening and therefore somewhat crowded.  However, once our food arrived, I knew after the first bite of that warm, tender Char Heel, that it was worth the wait.  Its hard to pick one particular flavor of the Char Heel that stood out because they all perfectly complimented each other.  Not to be outdone, the Whistle Pig was full of salty goodness as the bacon added a unique texture and taste that you've got to experience for yourself.

I've really got nothing bad to say about JJ's sans the long wait.  The staff was very friendly, there is plenty of parking on either side of the building, the prices are reasonable and most importantly, the food is legit.  If you are looking for a new spot to Charlotte, I highly recommend JJ's.

PS: Dear JJ's Management, I know you guys are from upstate NY; much love for the Nick Tahou's sign you guys have hanging up.  But you guys have got to bring a REAL GARBAGE PLATE TO CHARLOTTE!  You would be the only spot in the south us implanted Western New Yorkers could go for a Plate!  Give it a thought...

{"text":"I so want to like this place. However, my dining experience last night has made that a bit difficult. My son and I went for dinner because Wednesdays are Kids Eat Free night there. He got the Corn Dog Nuggets & I got the sausage special, The Royal w/ Cheese with no onions, a water and french fries. Our bill was over $10 - that's with his being free and neither of us getting a drink. Thought that was pretty pricey for a sausage. I looked after I sat down and the normal sausage combo, which includes drink and fries is $7.99. I thought, \"oh well, maybe this particular sausage doesn't count toward that.\" 
When our food came his was hot and he loved it. I took one bite of my sausage and realized it was super cold. I took it back and the woman said she'd fix it. I will note that they had suddenly become busy in the time that we ordered and when I took this back. 
I waited a good while before they brought it back out. My son had completely finished when they finally brought my meal back to the table. They did not bring me my fries back and there were onions on it. She said, \"Oh, was that not suppose to have mustard?\" Upon saying that I realized that the first sausage didn't have mustard either. I told her don't worry about it as my son is young and keeping him occupied at this point while I scarfed down my food would be a challenge in itself and I didn't feel like waiting another 15 minutes for another sausage. It was warmer this time, but not what I'd call fresh off the grill hot either. In fact, I didn't even finish it.
I didn't go back up to say anything because they were so busy and frankly I was over it. I left feeling disappointed and still hungry. Pretty bummed about our experience overall and don't think we will be returning."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness this place was awesome! I love hot dogs, so when my friends who lived in Charlotte suggested that they take me here, I was thrilled. This was the best hot dog that I have ever had.  The onion rings were out of this world as well.  Another plus was that they have a station with all the jalapenos and pickles that you could ask for! A hot dog, side and drink were right around $10.  It was a gorgeous day when we went and we sat on the adorable rooftop.  It was a great experience! Love this place."}
{"text":"I LOVED this place! It's not just the amazing hot dog and fries I got, or the fact that I can in expecting to spend $15 and was surprised to find a Tuesday night special (all dogs for $2 people!!!) so it was only $7. It's about the experience. I see all different kinds of people here, cool music, a wall of license plates above the register. This place has a cool factor of 9000. The patient staff isn't even bothered by the fact that it's technically closed and the dining room is still half full.  this is my new Tuesday night spot."}
{"text":"Craving a DOG....overall the Dog was good but way too much mustard on the coney.  We'll be going back....wish they had fries."}
{"text":"As a hot dog aficionado, I'm always looking for the next great weenie. JJ's is the real deal.  I'm not in Charlotte very often but when I return I'm definitely heading back to this place.  The charred weenie on my Char-Heel was a pleasant sight and the fact that the weenie sticks out both ends of the bun is a special thing. The toppings were not only fresh and flavorful but were also the maximum amount you can put on a hot dog before it becomes a hot mess. My lunch would have scored a 10 at the hot dog Olympics. 

Ordering is at the counter where you take a  number for later delivery by a server. The toppings are already enough but there's also a pickle bar if you're so inclined.  All the accessories are easy to find and are offered in spotless efficiency.  

The dining room is large and offers variety and comfort but If weather permits take the time to dine on the outdoor roof-top patio. 

Great classic rock art adorns the walls here and there (bathroom) and the Guy Fieri  sheet pan is pretty cool too."}
{"text":"Hot dogs are slowly becoming part of my normal food repertoire because JJ Red Hots makes them so fun & interesting.  I had been seeing hot dog posts on Instagram from Good Bottle one week announcing their collaboration dog with JJ's.  That did me in.  I had to go & check it out.

I had the Good & Southern Fried Dog, a deep fried hot dog with bacon, shredded cheese, chopped onions, 'good' sauce (Wicked Weed BBQ Crema) and FRITOS!  with a side of fries of course.  It was delicious.  I sat up on the rooftop patio enjoying every single messy bite of that dog.

King of Pops can frequently be found in their parking lot, but don't fear if they're not there - JJ's sells the pops inside as well.  

The only thing that could make this any better would be Dr Pepper."}
{"text":"We (BM) got here at 7:50pm on a Sunday. The Yelp hours stayed they closed at 9pm. We ordered and the dogs came out pretty quickly. It seems as they were closing up (chairs on tables , pickle bar empty).

I got the Chicago dog and it was pretty good. But, I actually like Steak n Shakes version of the Chicago dog better. Now the Whistle Pig that I got was awesome. Very good and I'll get that again. I also would like to try some of their sausages, chili and onion rings. 

We'll definitely be back. 

Right before our orders came out a manager asked if they could give it to us to go. I inquired as to when they closed and as stated Yelp had the hours as closing at 9pm. The manager said those were not correct and he will change it. 

We were fine with eating the dogs outside. I'll note that while in the parking lot 3 other cars (about 8 people) arrived with people that also assumed they closed at 9pm. 

In closing, I'd recommend JJ's. Cool place, nice employees and lots of varieties for your hot dog  cravings.

{"text":"Best hot dogs and Italian sausage in Charlotte. Try everything on the menu and add the onion things or house chips!"}
{"text":"Best hot dogs around! JJ's is definitely a place you must try! their dogs are great and toppings combinations are genius! I enjoy getting my dogs with their side of beans. I don't really care for the way they make their onion rings but don't let that discourage you, just get their tots! I love that they have rooftop patio seating that's ideal for the spring! Parking lot is small however I never had a problem finding a spot. Enjoy some king of pops after your meal!"}
{"text":"My new favorite lunch spot. I get the 2 dog combo, and usually try the \"Dog of the Week\" I have yet to eat a hot dog that wasn't delicious from JJ's. Pair that with those delicious onion rings, and you have a winner...actually, it's about lunch time now, so I'm headed out to JJ's."}
{"text":"I was excited when I finally had a chance to eat here. Love hot dogs. I have the Maui Gold. Grilled hot dog topped with pineapple salsa. The salsa was good. A nice crunch to it from the pineapple. However because of the sauce of the salsa. It made my bun very soggy. It fall apart when I took my first bite. But I still like it tho. And the 2nd thing I'm totally in love with is their string onion rings. It's not big, and have a nice crunch to it. You can tell by how much I like crunchy foods. Customer service was great. They check on us twice. First by one of the staff then by the manager. I will definitely come here again. Except put the salsa on the side since I really do HATE soggy buns."}
{"text":"Awesome and fresh fries!  Go for the larger 100% pure beef dog for $1 extra as it's TOTALLY worth it!  The unique toppings are terrific and the veggie options make this a great place to dine with all your friends!!  Best dogs in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"If you're into hot dogs and especially those with toppings aplenty,   JJ's is your spot.   Personally,   I'm not a dog aficionado and I always get suckered into the deal of the day with all fixins.   Give me a well-cooked, Sahlen's brand hot ?og with 'kraut and mustard and iI'm a happy guy.   They've got those too, just pull back the reins and keep it simple--hard to do at JJ's Red Hots.   Overall,  a great experience. 

PS:  the nachos are hand cut and fried potato chips which do not hold up to the heat and weight of the toppings.   Prefer good ol' corn chips for this appetizer."}
{"text":"Saw this place on DDD thought we would try it out.  The hot dogs are good, not the best I've ever had. I didn't care for the chili but I wouldn't say it was bad. The food was over all mediocre. No wow factor, nothing that would have me anxious to go back."}
{"text":"After seeing this on Diners, drive in's and dives like everyone else I simply had to try it. We tried four different hot dogs and loved them all. The chili cheese dog was incredible as well as the take on the Chicago dog (i forget what they called theirs) the toppings bar with pickles and and other cool choices was super unique. The only down side was the sides, we tried the beans and cole slaw and didn't care for either one. The cole slaw had no flavor what so ever and the beans were simply not what I was expecting. I will return for the hot dogs soon and skip the sides."}
{"text":"I ate here a few months ago but didn't review. The hot dog I got was pretty good, Carolina Dog if important not mistaken. Kind of expensive for me what it would. Ok beer selection."}
{"text":"They have made the hot dog an art form. The flavors they build, and the creativity they use is top notch. If you haven't been, you are missing out."}
{"text":"Delicious, conveniently by the hospital (ask for that 15% discount!), and delectable. Look out for the famous free pickle bar and the quarter hounder (bacon, cheese, and other yumminess)! A post-prandial nap def in order, but it's totally worth it! Only drawback would be the somewhat soggy bun bread on one side, but I'm still coming back for more!"}
{"text":"What a nice hot dog joint! JJ's had a Groupon and I just couldn't resist the temptation of a good deal and a new place to try. 

I'm on my veggie kick and while they do not have veggie dogs on their regular menu, they offered a portabello sausage on the day I was there. Tempting as it was, I choose their chopped salad with salmon sausage on top. Even though salmon sausage sounds kind of funny, it made for a flavorful dish! I was really impressed at the size and quality of their salad. I also got a milkshake...it was more on the milky side than thick side. 

The staff are really friendly and completely clean conscious. There was always someone cleaning, sweeping, or tidying up. The interior is fantastic and fun with excellent lighting. They offer a tremendous special on Fridays for an \"all-you-can-eat\" hot dog bar. Wow, go dogs!

I'm a fan and hope you are too!"}
{"text":"I have been on a hunting for the best hot dog in Charlotte and since I never paid a visit to this place my husband and I decided that was time to go.
They have plenty of options, you can pick from their menu or create your own hotdog. I rather creat my own since none of their options grabbed my attention. I went with chili with queso hot dog and queso tater tots. My husband had a combo with a cheese and bacon hotdog and a slaw hot dog with regular tots.
The place was not that busy so the food came out fast. The tater tots were the best that I've ever had in my life!!! My hotdog was good but was not heavenly good so I had to take one star from them since they are supposed to have the best hot dogs around. 
We will definitely be back, mainly for the tater tots, and I hope next time they surprise me with some wonderful hotdog!"}
{"text":"I got the whistle pig dog and the Coney chili cheese dog, both terrible...to much onions, cheese was still cold not very filling.  I also got chili cheese chips which were nothing to brag about, it's basically chips with half melted cheese.  The place itself is not bad, weird music, sports on the tv was a plus but subtitles was annoying.  Service was prolly the best part of it, very friendly."}
{"text":"I got a Char heel which is the southern staple of chilli, mustard onions and slaw.
It was very refreshing to see an actual real grill top charing up the dogs....nothing better than a grilled dog...hate boiled ones. 
Actual weiner tasted great but the toppers needed more punch to them...all on the bland side. You do have the option to create your own dog or try one of their many variations,  but I love the Carolina dog and was a little let down. 
My best dog in the Charlotte area search continues...but the deli beside Amelies French bakery on Davidson is still in the lead."}
{"text":"This place has been on my list to try since I found out about them through food truck lineups I follow on Facebook. While the establishment is clean and the staff nice, I must admit I didn't fall in love with the food. I definitely won't drive out my way for the food. Honestly I'm not even sure if what I ate was a beef hotdog, it didn't taste like anything I've ever eaten before. I really wanted to fall in love but it just didn't happen."}
{"text":"I LOVE WIENERS!  I like'em charred and/or grilled, not boiled.  Not ever.  Once you forget a wiener on the stove in boiling water and are reminded by the exploding sound, you will never eat a boiled wiener again.  I spent my tween and early teen years with season tickets with the fam to a AAA baseball team in Virginia.  I lived on chili cheese foot-longs for 4 months out of the year.  You would think I would have gotten tired of the dog.  Alas.... my love for the wiener endures.  

Enter JJ's Red Hots.  I have been wanting to go since they opened, but it's location is just a tad too far for me to make it for lunch during the work-week, and my laziness makes it too much of a hike on the weekends for just a hot dog.  What do you do when you go into the office on the Friday after a Thursday holiday and no one is in the office?  You take an executive lunch and drive around Dilworth looking for wieners and inappropriate items from Paper Skyscraper.  

My order of a chili cheese coney (no onions) with fries arrived promptly and smoking hot.  Good char on the dog.  Cheese was melting over the chili.  The chili was fine, nothing that rocked my world, but good enough, maybe could have used a splash of hot sauce.  I did the unthinkable to hot dog purists and dumped ketchup on it, but that's how I roll.  The bun was soft and fresh and held all of the ingredients in place so I didn't end up with chili on my rack.  Coke products to drink, including real Cherry Coke (yum!).  The fries were fine, nothing special (I will try the chips next time for something different).   The total for my dog + fries + drink was $7.01.  Good price for lunch and reasonable for what I got. 

They have an interesting pickle bar.  I tried the quick pickles and they were delicious.  They also had ginger carrots, pickled onions, and .... other stuff (not sure, I wasn't in a pickle mood today).

There was hardly anyone in the place at 11:30 (early for lunch), I am sure everyone was dogged out from yesterdays July 4th festivities.  It was easy to find (if you are heading away from South Blvd, it will be on your right).  Parking, in typical Dilworth fashion, was a bit of an angled mess, but it looks like it could handle a pretty steady lunch crowd without getting too crazy.  

JJ's gets a 3 1/2, which I rounded up.  I will be back to try other variations, along with their sausages and *maybe* even a veJJie in honor of our Yelpin' veJJie, JJ.  Nothing that changed my life, but a great place if you are craving a wiener.

Note:  A Ballantyne location is coming soon - I think I read towards the end of July 2013 after they get their permits and such in place."}
{"text":"Paul's YER (Yelp Elite Rating):

First time here. It's always so friggin' busy that I couldn't ever find a place to park. So i came on a Saturday afternoon at 230pm. Odd time. Not busy. My strategy worked!

Got the double dog combo: Joliet Jake Chicago Dog (had to see how close it is to a real Chicago dog) and a Quarter Hounder. After biting into the Chicago dog I quickly realized that this is most definitely NOT a \"Chicago dog.\" This is a BUFFALO DOG (Saleen grilled dog) with Chicago style toppings. But was it good? YES! Authentic? Not at all.

The Quarter Hounder....hum. Well it was suppossed to basically be a Bacon Dog. Well it had bacon but the bacon was chewy and not crisp at all. Flavor was good but that bacon just can't be soggy and chewy guys!

The onion rings were recommended and they were of the very thin variety but very flavorful. Not as crisp as I'd like but the taste was there.

Now the staff was EXCELLENT! Rastafarian dude at the front counter was AWESOME! Super friendly and cool. Everyone served you with a smile. Place is \"Diner Chic\" and cool inside.

I will be back to try their sausages and other dogs. Just recognize that their Dogs are BUFFALO STYLE which means GRILLED Saleens. Very good indeed but don't expect steamed or boiled dogs.

Overall I'd recommend JJ's."}
{"text":"NOM NOM NOM! 

How did it take me so long to find my favorite lunch place in Charlotte? I am so sad that I didn't eat here earlier. I love that their menu allows for vegetarian and turkey hot dog substitutions (for a non-red meat/pork eater). Their onion rings and tater tots are delicious and they have a great beer selection.

Sure, I may have to add an extra hour of workouts a week, but this place is well worth it!"}
{"text":"This is my second shot at a JJ's, having had the Ballantyne experience where the owner came back disappointed in my review and that I didn't get it, the experience that is.

So...son and I went to Dilworth for lunch.  This time I ordered the bratwurst and the Italian, like before and ordered a naked dog so I could really taste the basic product.  Also, onion rings.

Onion rings were good and portion plentiful.  And compared to previous JJ's experience were oily, but not saturated, were not a clump of rings stuck together, but were loose enough to eat separately.  Flavor was excellent and they were hot, not just warm.  Apparently Dilworth cooks to order without them sitting around.

My quality and taste standard is the Nathan's Beef Frank.  It is flavorful, savory, has a snap to the casing, and is a great dog.  Now I get it, that we all have different tastes.  My loves are your hates and vice verse.  JJ's is a good dog.  It came lightly charred, which is far better than one taken from water or microwave, was flavorful, but not savory and was fatter and longer than the Nathan's.  It WAS a good dog.  If I were rating Nathan's as an A, JJ's would be a solid B or B+.  Respectable.

For some reason the brat seemed different from the one in Ballantyne.  But it was A-OK, like this review.  Maybe my taste buds were off.  And the Italian was not only good, but dressed with the peppers & onions it also came with a really good mustard.  Excellent.

As to the service, the cashier  here spoke, answered questions and had, well, personality.  I will make another trip to Ballantyne to look at their menu board because in Dilworth the menus had lots of description.  In fact, there were four people standing inline and I asked if they were ordering and they said that they were reading the menu so we joined them.  Once at the cashier we had our questions set and completed our orders quickly.

So as a guy who eats about 4 hot dogs annually, JJ's is A-OK.  Am amazed at the 5-star ratings and rave reviews, but accept that hot dogs are not a big deal in my life, eating such confined to airports that have Nathan's and the occasional dog with grandchildren.  

If you do want hot dogs, JJ's is THE place to go.  If you don't want the doctored dogs, just order a naked and put your standard condiments provided.

I most likely will up my rating for the Ballantyne location after I re-visit.  JJ's is a great place for kids who like dogs and both locations carry out what they do pretty well.

Did I get it?"}
{"text":"Such a cute restaurant and really good service; however, I don't think the hot dogs are worth 4 bucks a pop. My hotdog was burnt, a little on the cold side and not very flavorful. That being said, I would go again because it's nice place for groups."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try JJ's for a while so my expectations were probably a little too high. It's so hard to find really good hot dogs and I thought this was finally the hot dog haven I've been looking for. They were ok, but I was a little underwhelmed. 

First, the hot dogs were barely warm, and the onion rings were just about room temp. To me fried food is nearly disgusting when it isn't piping hot. But on to the flavors. I really enjoyed the Char Heel, the hot dog had a nice crunch, and the chili was flavorful and savory. Not at all the cheap hot dog chili found in a 79 cent can. The Chicago dog was a little less enticing. I'm all for complex flavors, but with so many toppings they overpowered the hot dog. I felt like I was eating a meat flavored pickle and pepper in a hot dog bun instead of a hot dog with toppings. Finally, the onion rings were sweet and had just enough batter on them, but I've definitely had better.

The prices are good; two hot dogs full of toppings with a side and a drink for $9. The interior is very clean and warm, a mashup of old school diner with a slight hipster vibe. 

I'd like to assume they were just having an off day, and the next time I visit they'll have the best hot dogs in Charlotte. For that hope, I'd come back."}
{"text":"This is a very good hot dog place. There are many variations on the basic hot dog. They also feature bratwurst and andouille sausage items as well. Their slaw is excellent too. Our table tried 5 different combinations and we enjoyed all of them. Caution!  Eating these hot dogs can be extremely messy.  The proportions are generous. We also enjoyed the hand cut fries and onion rings. 
JJ's also features local craft beers too. This is a great place to hang out with a bunch of friends. It is a very roomy restaurant"}
{"text":"Outstanding supper and great value!! I had the all beef hot dog with grilled onions and peppers, bacon, and slaw with a side of onion rings. Very filling and excellent quality toppings.  The onion rings were very thin and had a crispy light crust that was delicious.  I can't believe my sister and I both are in East Blvd for $17!!!! Will def be back."}
{"text":"I never been so disappointed by anything that comes in between two buns but damn this place messed up. It simply was horrible Burnt over cooked smelled like gas and char toppings drinched and ill prepared. I just don't know how u could mess up a frank and brawt. Will be considerate give two stars instead of ripping them a new one with one star"}
{"text":"This place was bookmarked on my Yelp for a long time before we finally made the time to stop by. Man, I am so glad we did! We came on a Saturday about noon and there wasn't really a crowd so luckily we didn't really have to wait in line. I got a veggie dog combo with fries. One dog I got with rocket sauce and slaw and one with the cilantro lime crema and grilled onions and peppers. Both were amazing but the crema with onions and peppers was my favorite! My husband also got a veggie dog combo with fries. We were so shocked with how they looked and tasted that we went back in to make sure they were veggie, they were! We couldn't hardly believe it! We also got a free onion ring with our order because we used the yelp deal! The onion rings were ok but nothing I would probably order again, they were very greasy and the breading didn't stay on super well. 
They had a good beer selection and we were able to get drafts for $2 each! Luckily on the day we went the weather was nice and we sat up on the deck to enjoy our food. We can't wait to go back! 
Also, make sure if you live in Charlotte or frequent it often that you get a rewards card. If you get 50 points then you get $5 off anything, 1 point = $1... in two trips you could easily get enough points!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome spot to get your dawg fix.  Especially after some activity at Freedom Park, you gotta get those calories back up.  We went on a busy Saturday... had to park on the street a block down because their lot was full.  The line seemed long, but moved quickly.  Service was very friendly and efficient!

I grabbed drinks and some goodies from the homemade pickle bar.  They have wonderful pickled onions and other veggies.

After maybe 5 minutes of waiting our food was brought to the table.  I ordered the Kasemeister, a cheese stuffed sausage with pickled onions, sauerkraut, and horseradish mustard.  SO good!  My side was onion rings... which a lot of them were missing batter but they were still tasty.

My kiddos loved the food!  One got a pb&j slider (the shame!) and one got a skinless dog.  Both got gobbled up.  It was a successful lunch."}
{"text":"JJ's is a reliable spot for a quick lunch or dinner. Our favorite day to go is Tuesday when it's $2 signature dogs and $2 beers. 

The Sonoran and Whistle Pig are my favorite. The fries and tots (free Yelp check in!) are also good. They also have a loyalty program where you can additional discounts and freebies - good for the wallet, bad for the belly. :-)

The rooftop is nice when the weather is good. The only challenge is parking can be a little hard to navigate. 

Keep slinging them dogs , JJ's!"}
{"text":"My friend and I have been very much anticipating a visit to JJ's. Sadly we were very disappointed. The staff was unfamiliar with the menu and it took over 10 minutes just to order. Our food arrived before our beers. I can honestly say I can make a better Chicago style dog at home. The seasoned chips were the best part of the meal and the manager looked like he had just crawled out from under a car in a garage. The only reason we will return would be for beer and chops on the rooftop during the summer."}
{"text":"Now let me first say hot dogs really aren't my thing, or more so weren't my thing. JJ's however has changed my view on hot dogs forever! This place is amazing! I stumbled upon it in the Dilworth area about a year ago. I gave it a try because of its retro theme and cute rooftop patio. I didn't realize they were famous for their dogs. 

The first dog I tried was the dirty jerz (relish, onion, mustard, sauerkraut). It had the perfect amount of toppings to dog ratio. Also the hot dogs fit the buns perfectly so you're not stuck with extra bread.  My husband got the quarter hounder (queso, bacon, lettuce, tomato and special sauce). OMG! That dog changed my life. I wanted more!!!!! 

Since our first visit my husband and I have made it a tradition to go on a walk with our dog to freedom park followed by lunch or dinner at JJ's every week. It's a family tradition I hope to keep. 

I have also had the veggie dog, which was very good! You can't really even taste the difference! If you're a meat eater I dare you to try the veggie dog once. 

My all time favorite dog has been a seasonal dog that features pimento and fried jalapeños!! It's bomb.com! The only dog I didn't really care for was the southwestern dog, but only because the beans were over powering. 

Besides the food, the staff has always been friendly and the owner even personally thanked us for coming in. It's always been clean and we never had a bad experience and we have been there 10+ times. I don't think enough people in Charlotte give this place a try or enough credit- but they NEED to!!!

We love JJ's!!!!"}
{"text":"A hot-dog only restaurant?  Heck yeah!!!! Woot!

This place serves up one of my guilty pleasures.. Hot dogs.  And not just your run-of-the-mill boring things stuck in a bun.  No, they do it right.  They GRILL their dogs.  If you ask them to boil one, they will be highly offended.  And, if you smile and ask nicely, (and are weird like me) they'll even burn one for you.  It's on the short list of my favorite things.. a charred (almost black) hot dog.  Maybe I was dropped on my head early in life, I don't know, I have no explanation.  But JJ's did it for me.  And it was glorious!

They have great toppings, yummy milkshakes, and good fries.  I also tried their onion rings, but I wasn't that crazy about them.  Let's face it, I was there for the dog.

They also have some \"higher end\" items, like a salmon sausage and other 'brat' type things.  We really enjoyed our visit.  I can just imagine how nice their rooftop area will be in early autumn or spring.  They have a decent beer selection, and even have wine.

I predict this place will stay busy, and I can't wait to get back for another charred treat!"}
{"text":"As a visitor, this place is pretty cool. I love hot dogs, so I was a little disappointed at the flavor of their version of the Chicago Dog (their choice of mustard was bizzare).It's also a little pricey for a hot dog joint. And skip the fries...nothing special there. Otherwise, this place would've gotten 5 stars. Cool roof top tough, and worth a visit."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place, and I really don't want to give a mean review but here's what I found. 

Tables and floors....filthy on a Sunday afternoon. Ick right off the bat.
Onion rings.....SUPER greasy. I have a tummy ache as I'm writing. 
Dogs.....well, I've had better standing on a rainy street corner in NYC.
Price.....way high and not a great value for what you get.

 A clean restaurant and a smiling face or two would have really gone a long way in softening my review. 

(Lebowski's has nothing to worry about with their new neighbor.)"}
{"text":"Hands down 5 stars !!! These guys are way better than any hotdog restaurant.... wonderful clean comfortable atmosphere. A bit pricy but worth every penny !!"}
{"text":"Great services! Great veggie dogs! Great Tots! Great place! Walking in employees greeted us! Food came out pretty fast and by name. They even have outdoor seating with umbrella to cover the tables from the sun. Inside the were a lot it tables and chairs. I like this place because you can have a small get together with a lot a space."}
{"text":"Great place. We ate on the rooftop patio where we could take our dog up. I had the Andouille sausage dog with slaw and Remoulade sauce.  Fries were awesome."}
{"text":"Never would have guessed that I would enjoy a Hot Dog this much!  Brats too!  July 4th 2012.... 1:59 1/2 pm and the Rooftop is BOOOOMING with an All-Drum Banging \"band\" (of sorts) - WBTV News Van taking up two parking spaces!  Many people parking way down the street and walking and waiting outside 40 minutes (including me) to see and taste what they have heard and read from the media saturated coverage (good job) of this grand event!  The OFFICIAL [in a very DEEP voice] so-called official [in a very whispered undertone] OPENING DAY! ! !  YAY! 

By the time you are reading this the staff will be very familiar with the menu and you can order in your sweetest southern accent: Yes (some people are not sure how to respond to sentences that start with the word YES)!  In a more diplomatic (for me) manner of ordering I just pointed to the menu on the wall!

Maui Gold: Blackened on the outside and perfect on the inside... Loaded with Grilled Pineapple salsa and Chopped White Onion!

JJ's White Hot, stripped (almost it did have a bun) - They say this Brat is House-made, it was very tasty - Usually the \"JJ's White Hot\" has Sour Kraut probably Sauerkraut (not an angry German, uhhhh Deutschelander, I mean!  Sorry to the Germans).

On the Buns!  Martins Potato Roll, hummm...soft and an OK flavor, though NOT able to hold much more than a Hot dog without spilling some on your bling bling (if you know what I mean! 

On a serious note...If you have never dined on this Roof-Top, especially at night, especially when the weather is just right, even when its Hot or cold, you could imagine how fun it must be or... you could find out for yourself!

The Orangeade and Limeade looked really Good.... I keep hearing about the Onion Rings (from people not eating anything on opening day [I'm guessing these are Investors or Friends of the Owner...How else would they know they were in line with me???)

They did a great job for this Busy and grand scale event, so I imagine it will continue to get even better!  If I give them 3 stars on \"opening\" day imagine how much you will like it!

Sub-Plot
Staff seem very Nice!  Owners knew how to Hype-it up...Serious Social Media planning and I fond out about them from a Radio Spot...What I did not like were the people making the line outside Artificially LONG!  Once inside, a bunch of these people did NOT Order Food, nor did they Eat!?!???  I'm not kidding, they talked to the Dinning Guests asking them if they liked everything...These line Posers were simply in place to make a \"Can't wait to get in this place \"line\" to build the intrigue!  Bet it worked!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!! There was a baseball going on at the Charlotte Knights. I work there, I could of had a hotdog there but I chose this place & I don't regret it for one bit. Best hot dog I have ever had in NC. Yum yum yum. Will be back! The people here are also very welcoming! Please go"}
{"text":"When you have friends from out of town asking you can we go to JJ's. You have made an impression. JJ's is so good that we judge every hot we eat to them. JJ is the gold standard of hotdogs. I love the building, the rooftop seating, and the drums on the ceiling.  They have a great selection. Combination on a hot dog you never thought of and is out of the word. They have beer, coke in a glass bottle. I love them I just can't say that enough. Met the owner once and told him the Knight stadium needed his hotdogs. A must go if you visit Charlotte."}
{"text":"This was our first time here after grabbing some coupons for free hot dogs at the Knights game. The food was excellent, I had the special. The service was also great, everyone was so friendly and went above and beyond to serve us even. Perfect place for a quick and fun meal alone or with a group."}
{"text":"When you are craving a hot dog, or even if you're not craving a hot dog, go to JJs. Super affordable and extremely inventive. I have to come back and try their homemade sausage because I already know the hot dogs are great. They have a wonderful upstairs and downstairs patio in the dilworth location and even when they are busy the food gets out very quickly. Love the pimento cheese and that they carry local beers!"}
{"text":"The price is right and the food is good! The inside is nicely decorated and well lit. They have 2 dollar hot dogs on Tuesdays. Lots of different choices in how to get your hotdog 'fixed'. I also love the pickle bar but I am a sucker for pickles. Ok selection of beer at decent prices. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"No surprises here for normal hot dog shack. Music was good, hot dogs were definitely of good quality, along with the freshness of the toppings. Chili was wonderful. Only missing one star because the fries were just sub par, nothing special, no offense guys!!! The Orange drink and the lemonade are definitely something to order if you're looking for a non alcoholic option :)"}
{"text":"Who knew hot dogs could be so amazing?  Seriously.  My taste buds go crazy every time I eat here.  Peanut butter + honey + sriracha + hot dog = deliciousness.  That is one of my favorites.  But, there are so many great hot dog combos.  Love to take our out of town guests here for a weekend lunch.  It's pretty quick with a walk up and order counter.  And they have a great patio up on the roof!

We had them cater for us last summer with their little food truck and it was the hit of the party!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"No lie: I don't even like hot dogs lol JJ's is awesome! Went here for a family birthday dinner. Good beer selection and delicious dogs. I recommend the Southern Girl. The building has cool decor/signage and 2 outdoor seating areas, patio and rooftop. Servers were really friendly. We stayed until they closed and they still told us not to rush in leaving. Just a great, fun neighborhood hang!"}
{"text":"I only get the Whistle Pig here with fries. It's too good to get anything else, but I'm sure everything else on the menu is just as good! Go for the thin krinkle cut fries over the onion rings, the onion rings can be greasy. And don't skip the ranch for your fries! I really love it here, the service is great too."}
{"text":"Loved the location, atmosphere, and variety of toppings and combinations! I got the Southern Girl, delicious! Can't wait to try all the rest  yummmm!"}
{"text":"I finally visited JJ's even though I've know Jon Luther for several years now. I had the 2 dog combo. I had the Char Wheel and the Chicago dog. Both were perfect, though very different. The onion rings and the house cut fries were both fantastic, but add the chili and cheese to the fries for perfection. I'll have to go back soon because I need to try every item on the menu. And do not skip the pickle bar. Great job Jon!!"}
{"text":"First time here after so many great recommendations! I used my iphones GPS and turned out to be right next to the park my boyfriend and I use to go to when we lived in Charlotte. I got confused about the parking but Charlotte is that way anyways so no problem! The entrance was a bit confusing but an employee was nice to hold the door while doing his duties and knew That was the entrance! I went in, there were a few tables filled (it was around 3pm) and I was received with a nice greet by an employee who was ready to take my order. I let her know it was my first time and she recommended one that she liked with a substitution on the mustard and LOVED IT!! They have a pickle bar with a few selection of pickled items that were amazing!! At the table was a promotion for 2 dogs and onion rings that sounded amazing so I will definitely return! The service was exceptional as well as the food! The entrance to the restaurant is a bit confusing but all Charlotte restaurants are!"}
{"text":"I don't like hot dogs that much, so when my friend suggested this place, I was skeptical.  Why would I want to spend $8 on a hot dog and fries?  I decided to give this place a shot anyway.  Not that I had much of choice, because that's where the majority of my coworkers wanted to go for lunch that week.

As you can probably tell, I was pleasantly surprised!  I got the Quarter Hounder -- really flavorful, just a little messy to eat.  Their fries were delicious, and were even better with a scoop of chili on top.  They've got desserts from King of Pops -- a renowned local Charlotte popsicle place.  Niche meets niche.  And it's a good combo.

I'd come here again, it's pretty darn good."}
{"text":"293 photos at the time I wrote this review.  I have heard lots of great things about this joint, so naturally when I was on that side of town, we hit it.   I must say, closing at 9 pm on a Saturday surprised me.  I got there at 8:45 pm and the staff happily served us.  In fact, they served until 9:30 pm when people stopped coming in.......   What is great about JJ's - the staff is awesome!  They serve local beer ----- $3 bottles on Saturday night......

Back to the pictures, so many pictures, so many menu options.....  I went with The Whisle Pig and the Quarter Hounder.  I forget what my wife ordered, but both are meals hit the stop.    This is natural comfort food!!!!!    I will be back to try their house made sausages!"}
{"text":"This isn't your normal hot dog stand. They have the basics mastered! Whether you're looking for a basic dog, Chicago dog, Carolina dog, a Coney, or southwestern dog you'll find it here. 

What sets JJ's apart is they're not afraid to venture into uncharted hot dog territory. How about a Rueben dog covered in sauerkraut, Russian dressing, and a pickle spear. How about a pizza dog with marinara sauce, mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, and fresh basil. They also have great local beer selections on tap. It's laid back, fun, and exciting - everything a hot dog place should be."}
{"text":"If you like hot dogs, this is your place. They have a variety of different traditional and unique hot dog options. I went with the Italian Sausage which was delicious. The atmosphere is great and very clean."}
{"text":"A funky scene with great dogs and wide selection of craft beers. The onion rings have a nice crispy breading. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The first exposure I had to JJ's Red Hots was at an event where they were providing samples. My own internal monologue went a little something like this \"Hot dogs ... seriously?\" Oh, how wrong I was completely wrong! 

The gentleman behind the counter slinging these tasty delights at me just so happened to be the composer / creator on the main features in these entrees. He had magically worked his own little twist in to the Andouille and Bratwurst, and I was digging it. In the back of my mind I thought that this may be a fluke. I bet this guy brought the best of the best just to lure in new clientele. There's no way it's like this all the time. So, I decided to swing by the establishment and see if this joint is the real deal. The first words out of my mouth as I walked through the door was a little like Keanu Reeves, \"Woah!\" The place was ridiculously clean, and I'm a neat freak. Even the restrooms were on point. That alone will keep me coming back, but they were able to mix a 50s malt shop decor with a modern chic twist which is very comfortable and welcoming. On top of that, the gumbo was amazing and the Andouille was just as delightful as before. During the dining endeavor, I was introduced to their pickle bar. If you're a fan of spicy foods like I am, you have to try their pickled jalapeños. They have a great flavor and pretty big kick, but not in an overpowering way. I hope at some point they jar these so I can take them home with me to add to my own dishes.

I will definitely be adding this establishment to my short list of fantastic restaurants to bring guests when they come to visit here in Charlotte. 

I can't wait for the summer time to be upon us. I can get myself a succulent meal and hit the roof top to enjoy the fabulous weather."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time on Saturday, and was pretty excited about it.  I'd been looking forward to trying their hotdogs since I heard about their opening!

I went with a Sonoran...  and I've got to say it was lacking.  The bun was plain, no real flavor to it - tasted like it came straight from a grocery store bag.  No real punch to the flavor of the actual dog either.  :/

Maybe I'm just spoiled to the dogs at Jack Beagles.  They've always tasted amazing and have loads of flavor.

Two dogs + two beers (no sides) came out to $17.

I really wanted to like this place, and even bought a Groupon for it that I haven't used yet.  Any takers?  :P"}
{"text":"Great upper balcony--watch the Dilworth world go by and enjoy a dog and some fries.  Good beer specials too. And milkshakes. Why isn't this place more popular?  Jj's has lots of odd-sounding hot dogs with unexpected ingredients (like peanut butter).  Everything I've tried is good."}
{"text":"First, let me state that I want this place to succeed.  It's in a great location and there's not really anything similar in the area.  Getting hot dogs on a Saturday afternoon has been a longtime routine of mine.

Pros:
The hot dogs I got(the Char Heel) were fine.  Nothing really to complain about there.  Chargrilled and potato rolls, can't go wrong.

I love the location, the atmosphere, the patio, the deck.  I especially like paying tribute to the original tenant at that location, The Drum.  nice touch!


Cons:
The main reason I couldn't give a rating higher than 3 is because they said they had taken french fries off of the menu.  How can you have a hot dog place and not have french fries?!?!  Perhaps the cashier misspoke.  Because considering the place was not even a week old, and to already take something off of the menu, seems like an odd decision.

My next complaint, and it is minor, is all of the references to upstate NY.  I understand being proud of where you're from.  Or even a \"themed\" restaurant.  But when you have a Char Heel dog, a Maui dog, a Joliet dog and a Sonoran dog, you lose a NY theme possibility.  When you're in the heart of Charlotte, a \"Go Panthers\" dog seems more appropriate to pleasing your customer base than a \"Go Bills\" dog."}
{"text":"For some odd reason today I had a taste for a good hotdog. So I pulled up my handy yelp app and JJ's came up. I ordered take out...I ordered the char hill hotdog, well ok I ordered 2 char hill dogs . I got chilli on the side because I'm really picky when it comes to chilli, but the chilli was just ok nothing special but it was good on the dog. I ordered the onion rings and they were battered in goodness. It was a nice crowd, no one on the patio or rooftop. The wait wasn't  long at all. BTW Tuesday= $2 signature dogs. The parking lot is really tight as well."}
{"text":"I got to try out JJ's for my first time on a beautiful Saturday afternoon just right after the lunch rush (around 2:00ish). The parking lot is small but my friend and I were able to snag two spots that opened right as we pulled into the lot, likely due to the timing of our visit. 

JJ's has two floors, upper patio and lower inside seating. The menu is chocked full of regional hot dog combos as well as options for personalizing your own. I ended up choosing the Whispering Pig (bacon makes everything better) with a side of onion rings and one of the local brews for my drink.

My friend chose the brew dog of the week, You Got Smoked, with a side of fries and the smoked amber beer.  By the time my friend ordered, JJ's ended up running out of the smoked amber beer so they gave her another drink on the house!

We grabbed our number and found a seat. This is where JJ's hit a snag. One of the employees dropped off my drink and then took our table number. Since this was our first time at JJ's, we weren't sure of how things were run. During the time that we proceeded to wait for our food to arrive, we learned that the employees are supposed to take the table number ONLY after delivering your food.

After watching a table whom we knew arrived after us did we stop the same employee who took our number and ask her what happened to our food. She then admitted her error and our food magically appeared. Unfortunately, it was no longer hot because it must have been sitting waiting for its rightful owners. The 'famous' JJ's onion rings I ordered ended up being cold. Cold onion rings are just a no-no. My friend's fries weren't that much warmer. We didn't want to send the food back because we were hungry. Thankfully, the hot dogs were still pretty warm and ended up being very delicious.

Even though the error put a little bit of damper on our meal, I definitely plan on going back because the hot dogs were VERY good and there are other combos I want to try as well as get to have a different experience."}
{"text":"Good old fashioned hot dog joint that takes great care with everything from their ingredients to their decor. Their specialty dogs are all great and once you've tried them all you will come back for their always inventive DOW (dog of the week). Top it all off with a milkshake. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Just drive in from Atlanta age wanted to grab a quick bite to eat before I headed to a meeting. Found this on Yelp and once again, Yelpers did me right! A couple of delicious dogs, Coney and JJ's, with some of the best onion rings, washed down with Carolina's finest... Cheerwine!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went by tonight after months of talking about going and trying it out. After reading the great reviews it did not let us down. We will be going back again. The hotdogs were fantastic!"}
{"text":"This place is so good!! If you have not been here yet, you need to!
I actually absolutely HATE hotdogs, but they have some really good chicken dogs (I love the chicken BLT one) and other options if you don't like hotdogs. My husband has tried almost everything here, including several of the daily specials. We have never been disappointed. They always have great deals on daily drinks, as well, if you are able to grab one. The sides that we like the most are the tots, fries, and beans - they are so good!
Do yourself a favor and check this place out!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. We love the prices (very reasonable), the atmosphere (very laid back, come-as-you-are) and, of course, the food! (Delicious hot dogs, bratwurst, sausages, etc.)

This is a great place to stop in if you're an adventurous eater or a lover of the plane Jane staples, JJ's has you covered either way. My favorite are the Chicago and the Philly style dogs. They also have delicious tater tots and a very respectable side salad for a hot dog place. Complete with legitimate veggies like cucumbers and carrots. 

We've been twice and we'll be back again and again I'm sure."}
{"text":"Love the weekday deals here. Great rooftop for people/sunset watching. Live music on Tuesdays. Good food!"}
{"text":"Love the place .... the dogs are small-ish but they are tasty and I love the atmosphere..... would've given them a 5 but I did the tour for the free shirt and they haven't gotten in the 2xl yet.... I stil have my punch card because they don't have the shirts....... JJ's FYI most folks doing the tour normally aren't going to be an XS...."}
{"text":"Best hot dogs in Charlotte right here! They have two locations, which is great. JJ's gets their dogs shipped down from NY. If you go on Tuesdays all hot dogs are $2 -- hello deal! The food tastes delicious (I recommend the Char Heel, which is smothered in chili, slaw, and mustard), the homemade Arnold Palmers are great, and the dessert (King Pops -- the Banana Pudding flavor a firm #1 in my book) are the bomb! The service is great and the people that work there are super friendly."}
{"text":"This place is consistently good. Freshness is of highest standards, variety and with all their specials it's a great deal for a quick bite. Friendly service every time"}
{"text":"Best hot dogs in Charlotte by far.  Triple D don't lie!"}
{"text":"When you think hot dogs, what comes to mind? Those nasty things rolling around in a gas station? Burnt sticks served at every cookout you go to? Rubbery, tasteless non-descript meat? Well, let JJ's change how you think of hot dogs. 

They use quality encased meats (hot dogs & sausages from Sahlen's in NY) and top them with well thought out combinations of ingredients, ranging from ordinary to extraordinary! You can get a plain jane hot dog, a Chicago dawg, or many other signature creations. Don't like what they have... fine... make your own! They also offer sausages, chicken options, and vegetarian options. 

Service is great and they always have some sort of special going. I'm just waiting for them to add sweet potato fries or tots... 

Don't miss out on this spot!"}
{"text":"Very rude staff. Tried to go today and eat they where obviously having a corp meeting and left the door open. It was 20mins til 11am and basically kicked us out. Didnt offer a friendly appology or offer to have us sit down but not order. Wanted us to stand out in the poring rain to wait for a hot dog. Very rude. I would rather eat a hot dog that someone had rubbed across the ground than to eat at jj hots. What really makes me mad is that there was so many business people that didnt correct the employee that it showes me that customer disrespect must start at the top. Dont go buy a dog at jj hotd i recommend quick trip or have your 5 year old cook one sure you would be more happy with that. Complete waste of my time."}
{"text":"JJ's has the best hotdogs anywhere! I think of myself as a bit of a hotdog aficionado and theirs are fantastic! They use Sahlens and are grilled. They also put plenty of toppings on them. My favorite signature hot dog that they do is the \"Char Heel\" - chili, onions, coleslaw and yellow mustard. The entire staff was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I was pretty impressed with this place, growing up in the greater Detroit area and being a short drive from Chicago we know coney dogs and coney sauce and Chicago dogs and this place does a pretty good job!  Their secret sauce that you can add to anything is killer good too, use it instead of ketchup on your fries and you will not regret it.   
Food: 3.75 stars- fantastic for the area but hard to compete with a true Detroit coney dog or true Chicago dog 
Service: 5 star the cashier noticed my deer in the headlights look for my first time being here and was more then willing to help me out!
Overall, a good experience and I will probably repeat again especially for the price."}
{"text":"This review is a bit bias being that I'm from Chicago and once you've been exposed to eating Vienna ALL Beef hotdogs you'll never be impressed by another hotdog again in your life! It's a blessing and a curse. 

Although their hotdogs were good, I don't think I'll be returning any time soon. The service is very friendly and they're pretty efficient, the hotdog itself is not up to Chicago Hotdog Standards. I would definitely recommend for anyone that likes hotdogs, but for those of you that happen to be from Chicago you might not be impressed. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The pickled bar takes JJ's to 5 stars in my book. Love salsa bars? Try a pickled bar! Pickled onions, jalapeños, cucumber (of course), carrots.

I usually go with the Sonoran, a southwest style dog - beans, salsa, cilantro crema. Good stuff!

I have been meaning to try more of their sides, but I love the onion rings too much. Thin cut style with a crispy, flaky shell. I could eat those all day if I had enough Tums. 

My only wish is that the milkshakes were thicker; mine was a bit thin. 

JJ's is now one of my go-to spots; especially when I want to keep it under $10."}
{"text":"Who can say no to their $2 Signature dogs on Tuesdays? Well of course those who don't eat pork for dietary or religious reasons, but they should reconsider.
These hot dogs are delicious. I'm slowly working my way through the plethora of amazing options and then they go and make a weekly rotation of local brewery inspired hot dogs.
They seem to constantly be thinking up new ways to dress up the traditional frank. Grilled to perfection and with a myriad of options.
They also have great house chips and onion rings.
I usually do take out but it is a great location to sit and grab a beer with your hot dogs and during these Spring evenings, they have the roof top patio."}
{"text":"So my friends told me that this place had veggies dogs, with me being on a vegan diet, I was a little skeptical. Boy was I wrong, that veggie dog was amazing! 

I love how tasteful it was and they offered so many different toppings to customize your order. The staff was really friendly as well, I didn't know what to put on my dog and they were very helpful! I'm definitely going to come back here and I recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I checked this place out for the Noda Cask Event.  I enjoyed the atmosphere and the tasty hotdog, the onion rings were too stringy for my taste."}
{"text":"Since we were in the neighborhood, we decided to eat some lunch at JJ's.  We had a variety of hot dogs and various sides.  The sides tried were chips, pinto beans and onion rings.  Everything was good.  The time between ordering and the food being delivered was short."}
{"text":"So 5 stars is \"WooHoo!  As good as it gets!\" and I take that very seriously... so for those that are saying how can a hot dog joint be 5 stars... it's 5 stars for a hot dog joint!!!  For those of us who appreciate a really great dog in a simple yet cool space this IS as good as it gets!!!  I have enjoyed the Char Heel which is a classic souther style dog and the Joiet Jake which is their Chicago Dog... AWESOME!!!  The onion rings are not too greasy, the buns are not soggy and the hot dogs themselves are perfectly prepared and tasty.  The beer list is good enough and the prices are overall a heck of a deal.

So if you dont eat hot dogs, I feel bad for you but I will probably see you at Yoga and will smile with a touch of sadness.  If you DO enjoy great hot dogs, then beat feet here ASAP!!!  Eat up!"}
{"text":"I expected greatness from this restaurant with their outstanding reviews. however when a group of friends and I went here for a friday afternoon lunch we were served black and crispy hot dogs. I lo a good chargrilled dog but these were so burnt that we all just left and ate at one of the many better places close by. If you're looking for the taste of black char and some cancer causing carcinogens- look no further- JJ's burnt dogs is the place for you."}
{"text":"I had the Quarter Hounder and my husband had the Char Heel. Both were great! I highly recommend this place for lunch."}
{"text":"Maybe it was just a bad hot dog.. I had a burnt hot dog and my gf had extremely greasy onion rings neither of us could eat. I was craving a hot dog after eating gold star hot dogs in Kentucky. This was an extreme let down. I usually try to leave good reviews but this was my worse experience. 
Within 30 minutes my stomach cramped up and I've been puking for a hour now."}
{"text":"My sister loves hotdogs so we decided to go to JJ's. WOW I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. Delicious. We had the carolina style and char heel hotdog. I personally believe it is a must see and a try type of thing to love it. I will definetly be back."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go to this place for a while. Unfortunately, the  establishment and food was just \"meh\". My first issue was the restaurant itself. My party and I walked in and observed unswept floors and a smell that reeked of dirty dishwater. The kicker was that the restaurant was virtually empty! Why?! Definitely not what I expected for a Saturday evening. An employee eventually came to sweep up the food particles and trash, but the odor was still present. I thought a food establishment was suppose to smell like ..ummm, I don't know...FOOD!...*sigh*.... I should have hit an \"about-face\" due to those things alone. However, my hot dog hungry teenage son convince my partner and I on giving this place a try. We halfway mozied our bodies to the front counter and was greeted by a rather friendly cashier. I settled on the Seasonal Sausage with an order of fries and their TRU ADE \"Orangeade\".... well, I really didn't have much of a choice because their fountain drink machine was out. My only other options were bottled sodas, Lemonade, or beer....*ugh*... While waiting on our food, I took a swig of the famous \"Orangeade\"...I looked back at my cup. Not in astonishment, but feeling hella ripped off! * insert my WTF face here*...That ish tasted like water-down Kool-Aide minus the sugar! The only thing that made it \"orange\" was the color and the bits of pulp flying around in it! Oranges sacrifice themselves for this?! So disrespectful....Anywoo, our food came out within 5 minutes and once again the presentation was just \"meh\". I was expecting \"Hot Dawg Heaven\". But, my meal was stuck in hot dog purgatory....a dawg that was waiting to redeem itself... The chicken sausage was very pale. I know, I know...it's chicken...but, I was at least expecting some grill marks or a little char on the skin...*super sigh*...the caramelized onions on it was good, though...and the rosemary mustard let me know that it was trying to impress me...moving on to the fries...they were \"room temperature\" warm and a little too hard for my taste...my son polished my fries off, along with his fries and two hot dogs! However, a 15 year boy doesn't require much, especially when he's not spending his money...Overall,  I would recommend this establishment ONLY if you are in the area and hankering for a hot dog or you're a 15 year old spending your parent's money."}
{"text":"I've been up and down East Blvd a zillion times and I've never stopped at JJ's - heard it was good... going out for hot dogs were never my thing. 

I went with a group of friends - got the double dog combo. The No. 1 original was good, right amount of mustard and onions. The second dog was the whistling pig; it was good... didn't taste the bacon much. The chips were good and their home made buttermilk ranch is pretty good - I would slather that on everything. Both dogs had a nice 'snap' to them which to me is the mark of a good dog. 

Overall a good place."}
{"text":"I spent 2 months working in Charlotte and JJ's was often a go-to lunch spot for my coworkers and I.

They have a great selection of different hot dog types and even have vegetarian and turkey options.  I usually don't even like hot dogs, but JJ's makes some amazing hot dogs.  The pricing is also very fair for the quality and quantity of food you receive. 

The atmosphere is comfortable and they even have a rooftop dining area if the weather is nice!  The service was always excellent and the employees always seemed upbeat.  

I definitely recommend this place and I will be back next time I'm in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I drove sixty miles today to sample JJ's Red Hots for the very first time.

ORDER: The Double Dog combo, featuring a Char Heel ($3.49), and a Joliet Jake Chicago dog ($3.99). My side was their \"soon to be famous,\" Onion rings. Coke. 

* * * * * LOVES * * * * *
-- I loved the location, and the chill rooftop seating.
-- I loved the restaurant's cool lay out, decor, and the high ceilings. 
-- I loved the pumping blues music that puts energy into the room.
-- I loved the friendliness of the employees, and the fact that they know how to smile. 
-- I loved the cleanliness of the restaurant.
-- I loved that the owner's/manager's are present and involved.

* * * * *  LIKES * * * * *
-- I liked the taste of the Char Heel. The charred wiener imparts a delicious campfire grilled taste to the hot dog. My first bite was delicious, after that - meh, not so much. 
-- I liked that the drink dispenser had Cherry Coke. 
-- I liked the multiple seating options: booths, tables, and raised bar seating. 
-- I liked that there was a fairly large parking lot. 
-- I liked that the bathroom was clean.
-- I liked their pickle bar.
-- I liked that they had Dale's Pale Ale and other quality beers available. It was overpriced, but it was available. 

* * * * * DISLIKES * * * * *
-- I did not like the Joliet Jake Chicago hot dog. It was about what I expected - no thank you, Chicago can keep it. 

-- I did not care for the flimsy, barely warm, super greasy, sad excuse for onion rings. They remind me of the onion rings that are designed to be put atop a burger at places like Pinky's. I would not order them again. McKoy's Smokehouse and Sauceman's Barbecue have FAR superior onion rings. 

-- I cringed when I saw that my bill for two hot dogs, broken up, greasy, onion rings, and a soda - was over $10.00. A hot dog should never cost $3.49 each, much less $3.99 for the Chicago dog. 

-- I did not like the fifteen minute wait for my order, given that there were only three dudes in front of me, inside the otherwise empty restaurant.  

-- I HATED that there was a sign in the parking lot that said that I was subject to having my car towed if I parked in the wrong place. Welcome to Charlotte!

SUMMARY: An above average hot dog, selling for triple of average prices."}
{"text":"Checked this place out with my boyfriend. We got two hot dogs (Dirty Jerz and Chili Cheese Coney), onion rings, and lemonade. I was super stoked because this place seems to have it all - great vibe, outdoor seating, FREE PICKLES? I mean, come on. But when the food arrived, I was disappointed. The hot dogs were fine, but nothing spectacular. I'm hoping their sausages have something more special about them? The chili topping was okay but not fab, and the Dirty Jerz is just your typical hot dog. We got some of their special \"Rocket Sauce\" on the side, and it looked like vomit. Seriously, like a grayish-pinkish chunky mess. It did not taste good.

The onion rings were very greasy, more like onion straws, with no crunch or anything to them. Basically just thin onions dipped in oil. The breading did not hold together whatsoever.

The lemonade apparently has basil in it, but I couldn't taste it. Just was like a watery lemonade.

All in all, I'll probably give JJ's another shot, but with much lower expectations."}
{"text":"This place sets the bar for \"Fancy Hotdogs.\"

I grew up near a Sandy's Hotdogs, which I always enjoyed as a child.  But as an adult I grew out of it.

JJ's Redhots has reignited my childhood love of Hotdogs.  From the moment you walk in, its a charming place.  The decor has a hint of Americana, but not so much that you feel like you're in a 50's diner. 

You are greeted with, what is at first, a daunting menu.  There are a lot of pre-designed dogs, created to be awesome.  You can choose from these, but of you feel overwhelmed or can't find anything you like, you can do what I often do, and get a build-your-own dog.

Always check out the specials (a sort of \"dog of the day\" item).  My favorite dogs have come from the specials section.

Don't forget to check out the pickle bar.  I know what your thinking... What is a pickle bar?  They pickle carrots,  cucumbers, peppers, and a few other things, and you can just grab some.  Your supposed to put them on your dog (I think), but I always just snack on them add I wait for my food.

The prices are reasonable, the location is trendy, and the dogs are delicious.  Five Stars all day."}
{"text":"Hot Dogs are their own food group - seriously. I love JJ's! Great lunch spot. Plus the King of Pops guy is normally outside. It's like your favorite couple. I could probably eat the whole menu in a full days time if I put my mind to it. Sometimes I come fairly close. JJ's Hotdogs - Thank you. Thank you for being in the town I live in *virtual yelp hug*"}
{"text":"My last stop in Charlotte before I flew back home. I was there around 1:30 on 6/1 with some coworkers. I had the 2 dog combo.....The Southern Girl and Andouille Sausage. 
I highly recommend the Southern Girl hotdog. 
This was on Diners, Drive-In's and Dives. Good food, with fair prices."}
{"text":"It's the middle of the afternoon and you're wondering around Dilworth.  You want some casual food, but you just don't want to commit to table service.  Where do you go?

I wondered over to JJ's Red Hots in the middle of the afternoon on a Tuesday (don't tell my boss).  It's super casual.  You walk in, order your food at the counter, sit wherever you want and they bring you your food within minutes.  Perfect when you need to get back to the office before people start wondering where you are.

You can't beat $2 signature dogs on Tuesdays after 3pm.  YEAH!  I had the Quarter Hounder with a whole lot of pickles from the condiment bar, and it was delicious!  Although it was too early to start drinking (come on, I do have some standards during work hours), they seem to have a great selection of local beers.  I'm pretty sure I'll be back on the weekend when it's warm enough to sit upstairs and throw back a cold one while enjoying the view.

If you're looking for a place to hang out with friends over some beers and some yummy unhealthy food (healthy eaters, you can have a veggie dog and a side salad)...this is the place for you.  See you all in the summer on the roof deck!"}
{"text":"JJ's had me at pickle bar.

But then I had their hot dogs, and they're delicious! The dog of the week keeps me coming back [and may be one day I'll have my own ;)]. The service is great, the beer choices are good, and did I mention the pickle bar?!"}
{"text":"Went to JJ's on opening day. The restaurant itself is cool and I like the rooftop patio, especially because the weather is so nice here in Charlotte most of the year. But the food was just - okay. I know it's just a hot dog joint so I guess I shouldn't set the bar too high, but at the end of the day, the dogs weren't good enough to justify the price - which wasn't expensive. It's just hard to get around the idea that I could grill a dozen dogs on my back patio for the same price that would be twice as good. Long story short, wanted to like this place but I wasn't convinced. Might try it one more time once they've been open longer."}
{"text":"So good! Thoroughly enjoyed the uptown downtown dog - my boyfriend and I rated it the best out of the 4 diff dogs we tried! The chili cheese coney was meh when it came to flavor! Will be back again to try others!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times.  It is consistently delicious.  House-made orange-aid is delicious, as are the onion rings.  I haven't been disappointed with the dogs either.  I've heard that the roof-top deck is a beautiful view on a nice day... been a bit warm lately, but looking forward to visiting it in the fall."}
{"text":"I have been many, many times but have never got around to reviewing this place.  I just had the Char Heel and the Whistle Pig and I do not care what is in hot dogs!  If hot dog haters would get their nose out of the sky and try this place they wouldn't care less either.  The dogs are nice and juicy and and the toppings will make sure to shower up afterwards.  When you get the dog, don't put anything else on it other than jalepenos.  I feel that they come the way it is intended to be eaten.  We have always had good experiences here and their rooftop seating is especially nice during this time of the year."}
{"text":"Memorial Day without my hot dog!  No way! 
Searched yelp for a great hot dog place close by and decided to drive 13 mins here once leaving work.  Got a free tots offer at check-in.  I wanted something traditional and one to be daring.  I decided to try both the Sonoran and the cashier recommended the Brisket hot dog.  I love BBQ anyway.  I didn't have to wait in line or wait for my order long as it was made on the spot.  Young patrons 20 and 30 something's were all dining in on a Monday night.  Pricing is sort of fair for a non-traditional hot dog joint.  I want to go Hawaiian and come back for the pineapple dogs."}
{"text":"Best chili cheese Coney around!  And if you get tots, slather on the chili cheese....so worth the indulgence!"}
{"text":"If you haven't been to JJ's, are you really living? This place is a Charlotte staple! Great location, friendly workers, interesting decor with a lot to look at while you eat, and most importantly, delicious hotdogs! They use Sahlen's hotdogs from Western NY which are the best of the best. Lots of great combinations and options, I haven't had anything here yet that has let me down. 

To make this place EVEN better you'll also find King of Pops right outside with their delicious popsicles! Hotdogs, popsicles, ahh, childhood!

Give these weenies a try!"}
{"text":"Delicious food? Check. 
Amazing locale? Check.
Great prices? Check.

If you like hotdogs, and who doesn't, then do yourself a favor and check this place out. 

PS: Their free pickle bar is fantastic, goes great with the 'dogs."}
{"text":"I think I'll have to go back 
They have lots of different options & fountain Cheerwine.
Staff was nice & food came quickly.

UPDATE
I love this place it's my go to lunch stop.
Not a fan of the mustard but definitely love the Whistle Pig & the dog that has pimento cheese & slaw ( my favorite one so far)

The Southern Girl dog is the best!!! No mustard so you can taste the pimento:)"}
{"text":"Very good food! Great atmosphere, great service, workers were very friendly! You got a lot of food for the price! Next time we are in Charlotte we will go again!"}
{"text":"Sahlers brand from Buffalo,  New York (get a rope!) ain't the same as Chicago beef kosher dogs.  
These \"red\" hots aren't even RED!
White hots more like it.

As bland as the state of NY is statist!"}
{"text":"This is the best place for hotdogs in Charlotte. The hotdogs are very tasty, and the rooftop seating is nice."}
{"text":"First visit yesterday and I have to admit I love it.  Yes it's a little more than you'd spend on street meat hot dogs but then again it's flavor and style of the dog you are buying too.  

I really dig the decor, very clean and refreshed and I can't wait till the weather cools down so I can enjoy the roof.  Another great thing is the chance for a t-shirt afer punching all the unique dogs on your loyalty card.  That's a great marketing idea!

I was also glad to see some decent beers on tap and the remaining beers are can only.  

Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"When it comes to JJ's I would listen to NIKE and Just Do It. And while your at it get the Carolina dog and the onion rings."}
{"text":"JJ's may be serving red hots off of the grill, but their overall value and product is better described as luke warm.  In short, they grill up a competent enough dog in a great looking space, but be prepared to fork out a handsome price for the privilege.

A walk thru the front door leads to a relatively open dining room with a mix of booths against the wall, a centralized bar area and tables out on the floor.  Props to the central light fixture/insider-refence to \"The Drum,\" which was the original restaurant at this location.  You order from a central counter, where the menu is plastered against the wall .  The concept is informal and, aside from delivery of your order, everything is self-serve.  Credit is due here for a very polished and consistent look across the brand.

The focus, though, is mix of hot dogs and sausages.  All are chargrilled and then served on a potato bun.  The options are diverse and range from traditional to unique (e.g. a salmon sausage).  On my lunch trip, I tried the chicken and herb sausage which included grilled onions and peppers along with spicy remoulade.  It was tasty enough, but nowhere near a good value at $6.00.  It couldn't have been more than 4-5 decent sized bites.  Even the regular hot dogs go for $3.50 to $4.00 a piece and I would find it hard to think that just one was a filling lunch or dinner.

To make your 'red hot' a combo will be another $2.49 and that gets you a fountain drink and a side.  For my side, I tried the \"soon to be infamous\" onion rings as I was told they were out of french fries (how does that happen?).  While the batter was unique as it had the look and consistency of tiny corn flakes, my order size was small and about of quarter of the overall portion was only the flakes of batter which were heavily laden with oil.  This order was soon to be forgotten.  The other two options: slaw and borracho beans, though I have not tried them, seem lackluster when compared to the hype given to the fries and rings.  Hopefully the portion sizes are larger.

To tally it up, I was $8.50 in just for my lunch and felt like I had very little to show for it.  Was this meal truly unique, I might see it as a special occasion kind of place.  But ultimately, and the real challenge here, for this concept to work is for JJ's to differentiate itself from any other restaurant that serves a hot dog or a sausage.  While there are a few things here you won't find elsewhere, at the end of the day it's still a hot dog or a sausage and side items that are largely commonplace, all in a self-serve setting.  JJ's hasn't elevated these items or the experience to a higher level and, consequently, I'm left asking, \"Why pay the premium?\"  For these red hots to catch fire, something more is needed."}
{"text":"This is definitely worth going to at least once. It's got a fun, casual atmosphere with so many fun choices. Obviously, this is not really a place for eating light (although they do have some lighter options). The pig whistler is a good choice for those who want something a little more familiar. The kasekeiner totally lives up to the hype, but is a little spicier than I anticipated. Their signature orangeade is super, super sweet-- it was actually too much for me to drink, but had a good flavor. We will definitely be back to explore the menu more."}
{"text":"Definitely the best hot dog place in Charlotte. Highly recommend. I'm originally from Chicago so I promise you I know good hot dogs and this is definitely a place you want to try. You will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Kids were given uncooked corn dog bites, twice. Not very impressed with our adult meals either. We had a chicken \"sandwich\" but it had several large chunks of fat, and a hotdog. Not even worth the kids eat free night."}
{"text":"I DO NOT eat any hot dogs whatsoever. BUT I will inhale a charheel from JJ's!!!  I could go here at least 2ce a week if my diet would support it but since it doesn't I settle for once a month.  Love the atmosphere as well!!!"}
{"text":"1st time at JJ's red hots! This is a joint I've seen for years but never stopped. Shame on me. They a great variety and unique sides. So now when I need a hotdog JJ's is my go to spot"}
{"text":"Wow...  these hot dogs are really good.   I had the The Joliet Jake (Chicago Style) dog and a Chili Cheese Coney dog along with onion rings.   The Joliet was good but the Coney was freaking amazing!   The hot dogs were perfectly cooked and the toppings were all very fresh.  We loved the onion rings as well.

Definitely will be returning for more!"}
{"text":"I went here one Sunday afternoon on a whim I didn't really enjoy it the menu was kinda confusing to me I order a salad it was average something I could've made at home honestly"}
{"text":"I ordered a bratwurst and a standard hot dog. The brat was different than what I'm used to (contained veal) but the hot dog was delicious. I was told that they have all-you-can-eat dogs on Thursday nights after a certain time. Good eating at JJ's."}
{"text":"So yum. I love the dogs and chips. This isn't a fancy-schmancy place. It's a hot dog joint, so expect that. 

I always order the chili cheese dog and side of chips. I LOVE the Ogre sauce. I would dip myself in it and everything I own if that wasn't weird. 

My fiancé is a little more adventurous with his dogs and always tries the special. He's always happy, but maybe because he's using that Ogre sauce, too. 

Anyway, give this joint a try. The rooftop seating is fun on a nice day."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for a hot dog or sausage sandwich, you'll like JJ's. But, if you go there hoping for something more, prepare to be disappointed. Their chili is good on a dog, but not great on its own. Balsamic salad dressing was very blah. Both the Italian sausage and Andouille sandwiches are good. Their onion rings are the skinny shoestring kind."}
{"text":"Wow, so disappointed. I'm from NC and these are not good hot dogs for the money. My hot dog was burnt and the chili had no flavor. The only thing saving it from getting a 1 star is the lemonade and cole slaw. The onion rings are so spicy that I can't taste the sweetness of the onion. Very sad. Could have been an off night but not sure I will try again."}
{"text":"Friendly service, tasty hot dogs, a pickle bar, private parking, beer, King of Pops popsicles. These are a few of my favorite things and they all exist at JJ's. 

I won't tell you they're the best dogs in the world, because they're not; and I really wish they'd bring back the pickled cauliflower on their pickle bar. But this place hits the spot time and again, especially on Tuesdays when they do $2 signature dogs. 

The one thing I'd shoot down is the salmon slider. Tried it once and was not impressed. Definitely stick to the dogs when you go here."}
{"text":"Best dogs I have had at a restaurant in Charlotte. The big deal is they toast the buns so they are not all doughy. The onion rings are thin and the right level of greasy. Service was friendly. Will return again."}
{"text":"I got there whistle pig dog and onions on the dog was no the crispy onion string I ordered. The cooks in the back was happier gossping then getting my daughter's order right she 18 months and I asked for a skinless dog from the kids meal the order came and her dog was burnt. I had to peel the skinless dog my self. Needless to say the jjs was better last year. This year idk what's going on but I'm not stoping by ever again."}
{"text":"Wow, do I love this place...GREAT hot dogs and sides, good prices and friendly service...been here twice last coupla times I made it down to Charlotte and always enjoy it...love the beans, onion rings and beer selection, wish we had a JJ's where I live..."}
{"text":"Great place, great atmosphere, friendly staff.  My favorite is the sexy rexy.  So many possibilities with hotdogs.  Kids eat free on Wednesdays."}
{"text":"Hubby wanted to try this place for a while.  We went there during lunch time on a Wed..not very busy..uh-oh.  The menu looks really good.  Everything sounds enticing.   Hubby likes bratwurst.  We ordered a bratwurst and a Chicago style.  Opps - they are out of bratwurst - I thought the menu said housemade (how can you be out of them).  so hubby got something else - let's just say that if it's not a hot dog - it's going to be more than $6 and that is just plain expensive for something on a bun with kraut and mustard. My Chicago style dog was burnt, which seems to be common place based on other reviews.  I didn't mind but it was just ok.  I did like the toppings on the Chicago style.  The homemade chips are good. I think IF we come back, we will stick to the hot dogs and ask them not to burn them.
Update: was contacted by the manager and he offered a free bratwurst when we come back.  I'll give an update when we get to do that."}
{"text":"Totally surprised by the quality and consistency of the experience here! Even my husband, who normally can't stand hot dogs, LOVES the dogs here! 

The Sonoran dog (with a splash of hot sauce and salt) is by far my favorite, and I feel compelled to order it every time.  Another favorite that I've had is the dog with the peanut butter, sriracha, and bacon on it.... Unbelievably good!  We've tried almost everything on the menu, and have never had something we didn't like.

Being from up north, I have high standards when it comes to hot dogs---- and I can honestly say that JJ's nails it! I also love that they use martins potato rolls (a true northern thing).

If you're looking for a delicious, affordable, and creative lunch/dinner option, check this place out! Best hot dogs that I've had yet in the south."}
{"text":"I am a foodie but the simplicity of this place makes it endearing to me. It's all about the dogs and I've been here several times and always had great dogs. Love the onion rings and fries. I have not had the tots but I plan on it the next time. Hear they are delish. I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"I went here after my son's kindergarten graduation. They were having a deal for a free kids meal if you showed a good report card or graduation. I've been wanting to try this place for a while so I figured it was the perfect time! There wasn't much parking but it wasn't crowded so that was a plus. The staff was amazing. Very friendly and attentive. I ended up getting a chili cheese dog and my son got the little mini hot dogs. He didn't get the concept but I was told children usually love them lol. They even had crayons and a coloring page for him while we waited. They were attentive from beginning to end and I definitely plan to return!"}
{"text":"I fell through for International Hot Dog Day and had the house special: a beef dog with jalapenos, beans, cheese, bacon and mustard. I sampled the pickled bar, and got over-excited to see a sign that read pickled okra, but the container turned up empty. In JJ's defense, it was during lunch rush, and the pickled cauliflower (kind of) made up for it.
Overall, the meal was just OK. My dog was all bark--it looked good, but I like the kind of sausage that \"snaps back\" when you bite into it. If you can't have the casing, though, at least have the burn. The dog was too pale for my taste. My hubby liked the bun, but I found it rather heavy and bland for a potato roll. 
My side was the borracho beans, which boast a little beer and a sprinkling of shredded cheese. But even with a douse of Tabasco AND Texas Pete, the flavors didn't pop. It's a nice try, but for gourmet dogs the king is still Miami's Dogma, at least in the southeast.
Shout-out to JJ's Dog of the Week, the Creative Loafing-inspired dog Fear and Loafing. You can't go wrong with bacon, crushed pineapple, Sriracha, no matter what."}
{"text":"Ok, I had to post after my experience last night. 

First, everything was very clean inside, and I love that they have a rooftop. We were greeted by a friendly face, and I ordered the special Royale with Cheese : andouille sausage infused with blue cheese and topped with caramelized onions, pimiento cheese and blue cheese and whole grain mustard. It was amazing! And the side salad had plenty of toppings. I got my money's worth. 

I love that they have King of Pops on hand and the stand is often outside. We were able to enjoy the perfect treat after our dinner."}
{"text":"This place is right out of buffalo/Rochester it reminds me a lot of teds. They use sahlens dogs which there is no comparison to them in the south. The dogs a grilled over charcoal to perfection. They always have a good selection of beer as well. We will be coming here as long as they are around!!"}
{"text":"JJ's has VEGGIE DOGS! YES! As a vegetarian, it is hella hard to find them in a restaurant! I think they may be the Lightlife brand which isn't the strongest brand out there, BUT I am still grateful that JJ's has this option. 

You can also get them 3 ways:

JJ's \"No. 1\" Red Hot
JJ's Hot Relish, Diced Onions, Weber's Mustard, Dill Pickle Spear. 

Sonoran (Southwestern Style)
Borracho Beans, Fire-grilled Salsa, Red Onion, Cilantro, Shredded Cheese

The Joliet Jake (Chicago Style)
Tomatoes, Sport Peppers, Diced Onions, Pickle Relish, Deli Mustard, Celery Salt, Pickle Spear 

I've tried ALL THREE (on separate occasions of course, gah!) and all three were dynamite! Toppings were very fresh and very flavorful!

French fries are great too! Crinkle cut and crispy and just enough seasoning on them to not need ketchup. 

Oh, and the staff at JJ's? Awesomely friendly and awesomely helpful!

I'll be back lots of times!"}
{"text":"It was opening day and my wife wanted to go.  There was a long line so I didn't expect to be served right away.  The music was way too loud considering the conditions.  My wife and I had the JJs White Hots and my children had hot dogs. We had the onion rings and french fries.  The White Hots were a little small considering the price but were tasty.  My children were not very enthusiastic in their comments regarding the hot dogs.  The onion rings were good but the french fries had nothing special about them.  They were very plain.  The soft drink selection was not very expansive.  A lot of the new self-serve places are using the touch-screen machines that give you a wide variety of drinks.  It is a little expensive for hot dogs and bratwursts.  The White Hot upgrade to a combo that includes the fries or onion rings and a drink is about $10.00.  Check the menu before you go because it is limited.  I expected more than was offered there and all of us left the restaurant agreeing that we won't hurry back any time soon.  For that reason, I could not give it 4 stars."}
{"text":"Eh. The best part was the free tots for checking in on yelp. Not sure if it was an off day or what, but the dogs were burnt, the \"bacon\" in the whistle dog was charred bac-o-bits, and the mustard was very overpowering. Unfortunate, as i have no wish to give this one a second chance."}
{"text":"I feel bad reading all these great reviews and not loving this place myself?!? It's mediocre at best. The actual hot dog tastes like bologna to me, but they do cook it so that it has a nice crisp. The chili tasted like a can, but I swore they said it was homemade? They use great buns and we did enjoy the onion rings. I didn't hate it, but hot dogs are so easy to make at home that I wouldn't bother coming here again. Maybe if I'm in the neighborhood again, I'll give them one more try! The restaurant itself was clean and interesting to look at!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Definitely sit outside if it's nice out...hard to beat the rooftop!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place, the dogs are good and tots are tasty. Everybody likes a good tasty dog and tots and to wash it down they have a great beer selection. They will sometimes have a special dog that's not on the menu - when I went this past time it was a dog with bacon, queso, French fries, and gravy. I mean my top 5 favorite foods all together what a true dog craftsman who came u with this."}
{"text":"If you love hot dogs come here! Hot dogs are great so many different toppings and options! Fast and good service"}
{"text":"I just moved to Charlotte about a year ago and I have been dying to eat at JJ's! I finally did this past weekend and boy, was I impressed! 

First of all, for a hot dog joint you would think it would be a hole in the wall or a cart on the side of the road. JJ's had a retro, old but fun feeling inside. It was super clean and very welcoming! They even have a rooftop seating area for when its nice out, which is almost all the time in Charlotte! 

I got the Char-Heel combo (House-made Chili, Slaw, Diced Onions, Yellow Mustard on the hot dog, fries and a soda). At first, I was skeptical of having all those crazy ingredients on a hot dog, I'm a plain hot dog and ketchup person but it was the most delicious combination on a hot dog I have ever had! Side note - If you are from New York and you know anything about garbage plates, get this hot dog! It tastes exactly like a garbage plate!!! And on top of how delicious this all was, it's only 7 dollars! 

The employees were all very kind. The woman at the register helped me to pick out which hot dog I wanted, she was very patient when we asked questions and very helpful. The boy who delivered our meals was funny and willing to do what it took to make us happy customers. 

FYI - Thursday's are 6 dollar all you can eat hot dog bar! I will most definitely be going back for this sometime soon! 

Definitely check JJ's out, its worth it! I know I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"If you know me then you know I love basic American favorites like apple pie and... hot dogs!!  So I was super excited to see JJ's Red Hots when I was visiting Charlotte.  It's in the trendy Dilworth neighborhood, has friendly staff, quick service and rooftop seating.  The hotdogs are grilled and delicious!  They have specialty dogs that would satisfy any palate!  I got the Char Heel Carolina style red hot.  It was cooked to perfection and topped with coleslaw and mustard.  It was served on a fresh roll and I got some of their house made carrots and pickles from their \"famous\" pickle bar.  I recommend this place to anyone looking for affordable tasty cuisine.  I hope to be back one day!"}
{"text":"I had heard about this joint on the radio about new successful restaurants so when I was in the area I was excited to try it out. 

The dog of the day was \"Shred, Hot, and Bleu\". Right up my alley!  I asked about the dog size and the nice lass behind the counter said average size.  She was right and I was a little disappointed.  

I figured one dog wasn't enough for a lunch, and at $3.99 I wasn't going to spend $8 on 2 hot dogs of average size (there was a 2 dog meal but it didn't seem like a value) I was certainly ready to be wrong!  I got the onion rings as part of the combo (which was a good deal). 

I was quite disappointed with the dog, flavor and bun. There was supposed to be a hot sauce component but I never tasted it (I saw a tiny bit of a reddish sauce). The slaw was good and the Bleu cheese was just the right strength.  The dog itself was small and not hot (temp), the bun was 2nd rate (maybe a bit too humid? It didn't taste fresh). 

Onion rings were hot and delicious.  Very light batter.  Little crumbly made it tougher to eat with a nice shirt on but worth the effort. 

If the dogs themselves were better (a lot larger and hot) and they get the balance of toppings right then they may have a $4 hot dog but as it is now, I would pay $2.00-$2.50 for one.

So I came back about a year later and got a Sonoran w/rings (free rings thanks to Yelp coupon!).  The bun was much better this time, but the rings were greasy.  Dog itself (good beef taste) was really good (& messy!). Pickle bar was cool but no plates to put the stuff on!

Verdict: still overpriced for hot dogs but good for a change of pace."}
{"text":"Y'all. JJ's takes hot dogs to a whole new level. Service is always fantastic and the food is so fresh and yummy! My favorite is the Char Heel with house made chili and diced onions and yellow mustard - definition of a Southern hot dog. Perfect for a summer day, especially with a yummy treat from King of Pops!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Kasekreiner (House Made) sausage today, it was very good. JJ's is a great place to grab a quick bite. They have daily specials on food and drinks. Don't get me wrong it's not a high end evening dining place but for a hotdog/sausage place it is the best. They made a house made venison sausage several years ago that was so good it haunts me to this day, I wish it was a regular menu item. Oh and the staff have always been very nice, friendly, kind, gracious, and helpful."}
{"text":"Good dogs. Good atmosphere. Stale chips. I'll try the fries next time. Unique and cool spot to try for lunch."}
{"text":"If you love hotdogs this is a place you need to visit.   The Char Heel was awesome.  Also had a bowl of Chili which was very scrumptious!   Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Just ate here for lunch today!! IT WAS AWESOME!!! Def should check it out if you are in the mood for a dog!! they are good.  the onion rings are good too and all the choices look great.  Can't wait to go back and eat another.  Also A+ on the decor and atmosphere!! SHOULD REALLY CHECK OUT THIS JOINT! or you be missing out"}
{"text":"First time coming here. The JJ's Original with grilled onions and peppers was delicious!"}
{"text":"A fun & fresh show for their opening!  The drum corp was an original idea!  The staff were really nice and helpful.  I like that there is a separate take - out entrance.

Of course with so much going on our expectations were high.  I had to go with the Char Heel which was delicious with just enough crisp on it.  The potato buns are a nice touch, but I wish they were grilled, too!  The chili was a great blend.  The coleslaw was a good Southern flavor, but not enough onions.  Good, delicious, savory yellow mustard.  A definite hit.

The JJ's White Hot was - ummm - not a favorite.  My brat was smallish & overcooked & my sweetie's was way larger & undercooked.  We left half of both of them.

We were confused by what was Dusted on the Shoestring Fries?   We even asked & they said the salt is the dust...???whaaaa???  Just call them Shoestring Fries & we can assume they're salted.  I guess I was just looking for garlic powder or some other seasoning.  (it was also a small portion & they must have sat for awhile before we got them)

Overall it's a nice addition to the area - although now I'm on a mission to try all the hot dogs in the area to make a true comparison!"}
{"text":"Will never go back.  I was with party of 5.  One order was completely missed and the other one was completely wrong.  My \"cucumber & tomato salad\" consisted of a large clump of iceberg lettuce cut into 4 pieces, partially brown & wilted.  There was 1/2 tomato at best and maybe 4 slices of cucumber.  Not only were a few orders wrong, but it took a long time to get our uncomplicated order to our table on a VERY slow, early evening."}
{"text":"I've been hearing great things about this popular hotdog place and wanted to try it for a while. When my boyfriend and I were passing by we decided to stop in so I could try it. Being from buffalo, I automatically loved that they had our infamous salens hot dogs and were charcoal grilled! There were many different varieties of toppings to chose from but I just wanted the typical toppings nothing too crazy. We got fries to share as well. All the food was great and service was fast which was surprising as they were pretty busy. My only complaint is that they didn't have vinegar for French fries! It's my favorite and a popular thing to put on them and was disappointed! Everything else was great though. They even have a little side bar of toppings of pickled veggies that you can add yourself or on the side."}
{"text":"Seeing some pictures of these dogs on Instagram drew me in for a birthday lunch. (Happy Birthday to me!!) 

We walked in and were welcomed like regulars. Cheers anyone?  Being a first time customer I asked for the run down and a suggestion. I took the suggestion and got the Sonogran dog (southwest), my husband went for the The CharHeel, and my little guy got the kids meal corn dogs. 
We noticed the awesome prices of beer too. 

We got our drinks loaded up on pickled what nots and sauce from the little bar. Once we sat down our food was ready. Normally I have time to wash my hands get back and read a novel at most restaurants...  Not today! 

I got some onion rings to go with my meal and whatever the guy on here was complaining about was delusional! They were greasy & crunchy yea, but that's the damn style. Let the chefs make it how they want. This is 'merica right!! 
The hotdogs themselves were like little works of culinary art. The flavors created a mind bending journey to the west where I devoured this angelic dog much like I imagine Kanye did after his mouth was opened after being wired shut. The freshness and creativity are much appreciated.  

We loved the first round so much we spilt the weekly collaboration dog Jam Session... It was fucking balls the the wall delicious. 

I could go on and on about this place but I will just be making the trip from Spencer Mountain  to check in occasionally to show my support.

{"text":"If you're in the mood for a killer hot dog, look no further. JJ's has many unique dogs to choose from including the two that I tried: the Char Heel and the Dirty Jerz. The Char Heel has chili and cole slaw while the Dirty Jerz is topped with mustard and sauerkraut. Both were extremely good and I'd get them again if I went back. I also had the house chips, which were also good but nothing out of the ordinary.  

The food comes out very quick.  There was a group of 5 of us that went and we all had our food within 10 minutes.  Definitely a good choice if you're in a hurry. 

I was expecting this place to also have killer sweet tea but that wasn't the case.  They also don't have lemonade, so those Arnold Palmer lovers are out of luck."}
{"text":"Last week I had the opportunity to meet the owners, managers and staff at JJ's and to sample a good portion of the menu. JJ's is in the space occupied by The Drum restaurant, which operated from 1948 - 1995. Following the end of The Drum's operation several restaurants have opened and failed in this space. Judging from the new design, the level of enthusiasm and the quality of the food I think JJ's is here to stay!

We tried sample portions of most of the offerings and all were well-executed and tasty. JJ's uses smokehouse hot dogs from Sahlen's Packing Company in Buffalo, NY and the dogs are chargrilled over an open flame - yay for that charred smoky taste! Then come the toppings. There are eight signature hot dogs like the Char Heel (house-made chili, house-made slaw, diced onions and mustard) and my favorite: the Joliet Jake (Chicago style with tomatoes, sport peppers, diced onions, pickle relish, deli mustard, celery salt and pickle spear). You can also build your own with a long list of toppings, some of which are made in-house. House-made picked jalepenos and pickled vegetables are available at a self-serve bar near the soda fountain to top things off. I didn't try these during my visit but next time I'm definitely going to load up!

JJ's also serves several specialty sausages including house-made smoked salmon sausage with quick-pickled cucumber, red onion and herb aioli - so tasty and a good option for the non-pork eating crowd. The chicken sausage with grilled onions and bell pepper was another favorite of mine but the andouille sausage sliders take the cake with delicious cole slaw on top. Bratwurst, Italian sausage and a Polish round out the sausage menu. Salads and homemade chili are also offered so yes, you could even take a vegetarian here - the onion rings and desserts are great too!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love it because of DDD. I wanted to love it because it looks fun. I wanted a hot dog with snap... womp womp. 

I ordered the DDD combo (of course) because it is the touristy thing to do, but also because I enjoy being gluttonous. The cashier rang me up a different way because the daily special made it cheaper than the combo. My friend, who ordered the same thing didn't get so lucky - he paid the combo price which was about $1.50 more. The flavors were great but the texture of both dogs were not appealing. This was my first visit but my buddy had been to the other location before and agreed that they were soft and just mushy. He said he never had a bad experience at the other location. (Not sure where it was - I think south of where we were eating). The onion rings were also greasy and not crisp at all so there really wasn't much positive to take away from my visit. I might try again the next time I'm in Charlotte - I believe in second chances/bad days - but if they don't impress then, I won't be back."}
{"text":"I think this place is so great. They have good specials and they combine my loves of hot dogs and condiments. ALL the condiments! The staff have been very friendly and helpful with allergy information. I have celiac disease and have to be careful, and they will very kindly create your dog sans-bun with a fresh pair of gloves. I also had the borracho nachos, made with house fries rather than chips. I have been craving them ever since. The price is low and the quality is high. I will keep coming back to JJ's."}
{"text":"These aren't your typical wimpy hot dog. This is a perfect quick lunch when you have late dinner reservations. I got the Chili Cheese Coney without the onions, my dad got the JJ's \"No. 1\" Red Hot, and my mom got a Chili Coney without cheese and onions. We also got a side of JJ's French Fries. My dog was good but the chili was super flavorful, my mom had the same feelings about her's. I will say my dog was a bit more burnt that i like so i would have preferred a little less char. My dad loved how chard the hot dog was and thought the toppings melded perfectly. I would definitely go back but i'll give it a little bit of time."}
{"text":"The veggie dog option is great.  Just to note is tasty but not vegan.  The environment is fun and casual.  A nice place to kick back with friends or the family.  Try it you will love it."}
{"text":"One word to describe JJ Red Hots....PATIO.  Their rooftop patio is perfection!

This lil spot has drink specials every day of the week, including $2 domestics on Friday nights.  How perfect is it to grab a beer and enjoy the rooftop patio in the heart of Dilworth?

We ordered cheese fries to go with our beer.  They were pretty good.  Cheese fries and two beers were $8.00.

I would suggest coming here for a drink/app before walking to dinner in Dilworth!"}
{"text":"JJ's caught me by surprise and I couldn't be more excited.  If you haven't visited, you need to make it a point to check out this new hotspot.

Let me first start out by saying I have always been a little bias on my hotdog cravings.  For the past decade, I've loved Chicago dogs moreso than the Carolina style.  I did grow up in Statesville in the 80s and there was a place called Elliott's Old Fashioned Ice Cream and their ice cream and hot dogs were insanely great and memorable.  It was a classic soda shop feel and was very 50's.  It since closed after the owners passed away and I've been disappointed 95% of the Carolina dogs that I've had.  Enter, JJ's.

My wife got the Char Heel and Homemade Chips w/ Ranch.  I got the Chicago Dog with Onion Rings.  I ended with a Chocolate Shake and she had a nice import beer as their selection is great for this type of spot.

My Chicago Dog was fantastic and I have to say they have the edge in flavor over Matt's Chicago Dog.  That floored me.  The relish isn't the noteable bright green buy the flavor was fantastic.  Now, the Char Heel.  This is the best Carolina-Style hotdog that I have had since 1995ish.  As soon as I took a bite of this magnificent hotdog and it had that perfect snap, the flavors of the onions, chili and mustard sent me back.  Yep, I'm a little intense with this one but it's just that good.  The flavor was perfectly balanced and it brought me back to my youth.  

This is located next to Lebowski's and the businesses that tend to go in here don't last long.  They have a great parking lot now and a rooftop patio so I'm hoping people take advantage of this place.  I know I'll be doing my part in hope they stay strong."}
{"text":"For some reason I expected these place to have like 4 kinds of hotdogs and bags of chips as sides. I was completely wrong. Being the dedicated Yelper that I am, had to try the Yelp dog before it was gone. I'll eat a hotdog if I am at a cook out and that's my only option, but its not a food I ever order or buy at the grocery store. JJ's might change that. 

First off, it's very nice inside. Not divey at all. Their menu is large with hotdogs, sausages, chicken sandwiches and even some healthy stuff. 

I opted for the Yelp dog. Pretzel bun, beer cheese, mustard and saurkraut. Mmm. I hope they put on the menu because I would come back for that. The house made chips are awesome. Can we take a moment to highlight their ranch? It's very heavy on the dill and absolutely dillicious. I know, I'm sorry. Seriously though that ranch is so good. They also have a little bar with housemade pickles, jalepenos and sauces. 

They have a great patio and upstairs area, wish we would have discovered this place over the summer."}
{"text":"Though there is now a fancy new JJ's (okay, not fancy by most people's reckoning, but fancy perhaps compared to the original), the East Boulevard location is still the best. I just wish it were closer. Of course, then I would be spending way too much time there, so it's probably for the best that it's just where it is.

You can find a most excellent selection of dogs on the menu, but even after all these visits, my favorite is still the Char-Heel. Nothing quite like a charred dog. Though you can of course eat a boiled dog - and you can probably eat one without even boiling it, truth be known - there isn't one quite like a dog without a good char on it. And while most of JJ's dogs have a good char, the combination of ingredients on the Char-Heel just seem to come out the best.

There are a decent selection of toppings on the others, but they don't hit the spot quite the same. While I like the sides, they almost always end up a little limp for my taste. A good example is that batch of onion rings (straws?). The first one or two is great. But after a few minutes, it turns into a sloppy mess, and it's really hard to get to the bottom, but throw just a couple on top of the Char-Heel and you're set.

Another great thing about JJ's is that pickle bar. And also don't forget to use your Yelp app - you can typically get something for free (sometimes more than one thing), just for firing it up."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I recently tried another hot dog place here and it is nothing compared to JJ's.  Kid friendly with a lot to choose from.  I will have to come many more times to enjoy it all.

They have a \"hall of fame\" menu that is on the table, so check that out before you order. They have a text club and when you join you get a free dog! Also free rings with a yelp check in...wow! 

I can't wait to return for more.  And make sure you stop @ King of Pops on your way out for a frozen treat."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Diners, Dives, and Drive-ins so had to check it out since it was right in my back yard. Fun place! Loved the pickle bar. It's kind of hard to find a bad hot dog and this place did not disappoint, but there's more creativity involved. So go for that. Have a good time!"}
{"text":"Good for a quick lunch. It took me a while to figure out what I wanted to order with so many good options; walk up to order restaurants are not my favorite to be a first timer. I went with the chicken sandwich with pickle and coleslaw, onion rings and an orangeade; came to $9 with change. The sandwich was on a hot dog bun - two chicken fingers, 1/4 pickle and a heaping amount of coleslaw. A mess to eat but still good. The onion rings were thin and crisp. A friend of mine got the nachos which I ate most of. Whoops. I will order them next time because the chips were thick and a perfect mix of crisp and chewy. Sometimes you just want nacho cheese, can't be eating clean all the time. I have to mention the orangeade was fantastic! It tasted like a better version of Snapple orangeade from my 90s childhood. I would go back for this drink alone!"}
{"text":"Their graphic design and logos are awesome! 
But their hot dogs don't live up to the great design concept! 
You would think for 4$ for a hot dog you would get a Homemade bun. No, you get a Cold, Merita style white bun. (Not even a steamed bun!) Just a cold, tasteless bun.

Fried onions rings were bad also bc the batter had fallen off and you could see just the greasy onions. Chef obviously did not know how to prepare them properly that night b/c the batter did not stick.

They had LOTS of people working behind the counter and there were Not many customers. 7 pm on a Wednesday night. 

*Someone please tell the owners b/c this really is a great concept and we want to See this restaurant succeed!"}
{"text":"I will start by saying I will come back to try some other items on their menu but I have an issue with their hotdogs. The style of hotdog was not good quality. When I crave a hotdog, I want a firm dog that's snaps when I bite it. These were soft a pale in color. This place offers something very very far from a Nathan's, Sabrett's, Hebrew National, etc. The biggest sin..THEY DON'T HAVE MUSTARD!!!!!  They do offer some weird bright yellow stuff that may resemble mustard to those who do not know better. If you think French's or Hienz is mustard, I have a bridge I'd like to sell you."}
{"text":"One of the best hot dawgs that I've had in a while. Bread was cotton soft and the chili was great. I had the Char Heel & a Chili Cheese Coney. 2 Thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"For a hot dog restaurant, JJ's is pretty decent. In my visit, I ordered the double dog combo with the Sonoran dog, the Dirty Jerz, and onion rings. It was a little over $10 with a drink, which isn't too bad of a deal for a decent amount of food. I was particularly impressed at how quickly my food came out too; I checked out the pickle bar (Dill pickle, sweet pickle, pickled red onions, pickled jalapenos, and pickled carrots), grabbed a seat and the dogs were on my table in 3-4 total minutes.
The dogs were decent quality, and the buns were really nice and soft. Turns out they use Martin's potato rolls, which are probably my favorite buns so that explains the high quality. The Sonoran dog was good but not great. The beans and salsa had just a hint of heat and added good flavor to the dog, but the cilantro cream was basically just ranch, and there was way too much of it for my liking as it overpowered everything else. I scraped off a lot of the cream, added a few pickled jalapenos, and the dog was a lot better. The Dirty Jerz was essentially the same: decent dog but nothing life changing. The sweet pickles balanced the sauerkraut well, and mustard is always perfect on a hot dog. The onion rings were pretty bad in my opinion. They're pretty greasy, thin, and VERY crunchy. I can understand why some people are fans, but I prefer much thicker cut onion rings with good onion flavor, and these were the exact opposite of that.
Overall, my two dogs were decent but nothing special and the onion rings were just not my cup of tea, but the prices weren't bad, the food came out very quick, and the pickle bar is pretty cool."}
{"text":"We enjoyed having the veggie dog option!  It was quite tasty!  I'd love to have seen an option on the menu or on the website that marks what is vegetarian or vegan, too, though."}
{"text":"I love hot dogs. There, I said it. I always feel like less of a foodie whenever I have one, but I don't care. Hot dogs, FTW. 

The hot dogs at JJ's are hot dogs unlike any I've ever had. The dog itself is whatever. It's a hot dog. But the toppings, and more importantly the combination of toppings is what takes these to the next level. 

Graham was traditional and boring with his dog. He had the Char-heel, which was a combination of slaw, chili, raw onions and mustard. I loathe all of those toppings, so I wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole. But in his words it was \"effing delicious\". 

I had the dog of the week (the big cheesy), and oh baby... It was topped with bacon, jalepeno pimento cheese & pickled jalepeno. One word to describe it: epic. The pimento cheese was so good. It's not a combination I would have ever put together on my own, but it definitely worked! 

We both had our dogs with chili cheese fries (which were fantastic) and best of all, it was SO CHEAP! $15 for everything, including two sodas."}
{"text":"Killer dogs, selection of beer, sides, and all for an incredible price. Service is good, decent parking, inside is nice."}
{"text":"Saw a picture of the dog of the week on Twitter. It was enough to make me leave my house and drive to JJ's immediately. Seriously, I didn't even take the time to change out of my pajamas.

This week's dog: Pork and Greens. Sauteed collard greens, bacon, red onion and pumpkin mustard. Collard greens just make everything better. Go get this. Delicious.

My other dog: The Char Heel. Chili, slaw, onions, mustard. You can never go wrong with this Carolina classic.

The two dog deal comes with a side (I went with the beans. They were good, but I wish I had went with onion rings. Rookie mistake) and a drink for less than ten bucks.

Workers were friendly. Didn't take long at all to get my food. I believe it took longer to try to bust a left turn out of the parking lot. Oh East Blvd, you win every time.

This spot has been a revolving door of places for years. It's nice to see something stick here. Cheers to JJ's!"}
{"text":"Who would have thought you could do so much with a hot dog?  This place is worth visiting.  The royale with cheese is a must for any southerner who loves pimiento cheese!  Dogs are $2 on Tuesdays as are draft beers!  We would definitely come back again to run through the menu!"}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars. If you're into hot dogs with many unique toppings, this is your place. I'm more of a Vienna Beef boiled dog kind of guy but it's tough to find a good hot dog joint in Charlotte. 

I've been a few times and it's been consistently good every time. First time I was there, owner came out to talk to me. Very friendly and you could tell he cared about his product. 

Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My brother, a prolific Charlotte Yelp Elitist, had been raving about JJ's \"Soon To Be Famous\" Onion Rings so I had to come see for myself. Walking in, we found ourselves transported to a classic diner space. You walk up and place your order then have a seat. Thankfully we beat the lunch rush since there wasn't a line yet. Also appreciated how clean it was inside.

I ordered a Single Dog Combo with the Chili Cheese Coney Dog and subbed the fries for the onion rings. My brother did the same thing except he ordered the Sonoran (Southwestern Style). The Chili Cheese dog was delicious. The bun held up the dog and fixins. The onion rings were out of this world! Thin rings like onion straws that also reminded me of The Outback Steakhouse's Bloomin' Onion but a way better version. Excellent seasoning in the batter and crispy texture. Some parts could be a little greasy, but it's worth it. I'd come back just to order the rings but the dogs are also great."}
{"text":"The Chicago dog was fantastic, had it with the chips...the dogs are definitely the star of the show.  This place has a really good positive vibe, very casual, upbeat music, friendly and efficient staff.  Crowd was mixed mostly adults but some tables with kids too.  They do serve beer, didn't check out the selection though.  2 dogs, 2 sides, 2 drinks was about $15.  Can't wait to try the chili dog."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! can't go wrong with their hot dogs and I love the weekly hot dog specials.  The southern girl dog is probably my favorite and you can't go wrong with a side of tots.  Follow their instagram for their weekly specials (warning: it will make you hungry).  
They also have a great selection of beers, with good deals, and a rotating draught list! 

And don't forget to try their homemade pickles! I love the spicy ones."}
{"text":"I have traveled around, and lived in quite a few different places but I can say without reservation that JJ's serves the BEST dogs I have ever eaten. I know that is a pretty strong statement, but JJ's takes the simple concept of a hot dog and makes it something much better. The dogs themselves are TOP quality, the buns are TOP quality. Then the dogs are chargrilled, and the buns are toasted on a grill. That is hard to top by itself, but they offer topping combinations that take an AWESOME dog, and knock your taste buds out of the park.  Am I raving about hot dogs ? Absolutely ! Try them for yourself, and you'll be a believer."}
{"text":"I loved the laid back atmosphere and the top deck patio was really awesome. Plus killer hot dogs to boot. I got an authentic Chicago style dog (NO KATSUP ALLOWED) which I haven't had since I lived in the windy city. Killer tots fried to perfection. Made for a great lunch for two for less than 20 bucks. Plus theres a pickle bar?! C'mon. Whats not to love?"}
{"text":"JJ's is a Charlotte gem and I was thrilled to find it yesterday!  They've got a great hot dog menu including a Chicago dog that's done correctly. Beyond dogs, they've got great drinks (house made orangeade!), other foods (chicken, smoked salmon, etc.), and they're very kid friendly. My son loved the giant crayon bucket and they even taped his drawing to the wall :)
Plus, kids eat free on Wed, so, next time I'll be visiting on a Wed. I was totally impressed with the house made pickles (hot and sweet), pickled jalo's and onions, and ginger carrots. JJ's is comfortable, well decorated and clean, and the staff are friendly and attentive. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a tasty, creative casual meal at a very fair price."}
{"text":"JJ's hotdogs are pretty good. Slightly charred but not overdone. The chili is decent. The red hot relish is sweet and delicious. Had their dogs at their store and also food truck, both are great."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE Customer Service. 
  after having one of the bottles that were improperly secured ruin a $125 sweater.    I brought it to the attention of the manager Darren that stated they would make it right.     He just had to speak with his owner John and then they'd be in touch.      I did speak with the owner John and he was very hesitant to believe my story and sounded skeptical but he'd look into it and get back to me.   7 days later no reply.      I called several times with no return call and finally wrote some reviews.   afterwards  owner Johnathan Luther sent me a reply email stating due to my reviews he is not interested in my loss and rather lose me as a customer.   There are soo many good restaurants in the area.   Go to one that cares about their customers.     support local and boycott  JJ Red hots

\" my offer is now $0.

It didn't have to end this way, but that was your choice, not mine. We never like to lose a customer, but in this case, I feel like we came out even\"

JJ"}
{"text":"This is my #1 place to visit when I'm in Charlotte. My go to is the vegetarian Sonoran (southwestern style)dog or the vegetarian Joliet Jake (Chicago style) dog.  The house chips with the buttermilk ranch dip is so good, but my husband prefers the tater tots with cheese on top. He usually orders the Dirty Jerz turkey dog or the Kasekreiner sausage dog. We've heard good things about the Smoked Salmon Sliders, but I haven't had the chance to order them yet. I love that this place has its own parking lot and that is a big plus compared to many places in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Every time I visit Charlotte I have to stop at JJs Red Hots and this past trip was no exception! We had lunch at a shady tree and enjoyed the best hot dogs in town. The icy lemonade was the perfect partner to fully loaded hot dogs and my sausage. The fries and rings are out of this world. Stop by for a lunch and then take a short walk down the street to the nicest Starbucks I've been in (and I've been in a lot!)"}
{"text":"Pretty good hot dogs. We went on kids eat free day and it was delicious. The inside seating  was a bit tight, but if you don't have a large party you should be fine."}
{"text":"After growing up in Buffalo, I left it (and my favorite Ted's hot dogs) behind in 1999. Since that time I've been relegated to accepting my only taste of home would be on the very rare occasions I made a trip back North. Today, I learned that I was wrong! This place was awesome! The Sahlen's hot dogs were grilled to perfection and the toppings were perfect. It wasn't until after we began eating that I realized the onion rings looked like those served back home at Ted's as well. Definitely a must try next time! The staff was super nice and fun to engage with and all around it was just a great experience. I will definitely be making return trips on the regular!"}
{"text":"A good hot dog? yes.  Five stars good? No way.  
I have driven by plenty of times and thought about stopping but I have to be in a certain mood to have hot dogs, so when my daughter wanted to take me out for Father's day, I decided it was time to check out JJ's.

We arrived at 11:30 and I was surprised to find that we were the only people in the place. Usually not a good sign, but I had read so many glowing reviews we assumed that the rush would catch up with us later.

There was plenty of help behind the counter and they were eager to take our order. I had the Char dog with mustard, chili and slaw, my daughter had the Fryder man which had cheese, chili and french fries on the dog. We both had fries and we got an order of onion rings to share. I'll list the highs and lows:

Service was very good and the gang behind the counter was attentive but the kitchen was a little slow since we were the only ones there. Not too bad if you consider they make everything from scratch but keep it in mind if you plan to run in for a quick lunch and are on a schedule.

The star of the show is their hot dogs and their wieners were very good.  Nice char, mildly seasoned and clean tasting.  Natural casing made for a nice bite.  They are so mild that the flavor of the wiener is lost with most of the toppings.  Chili was good and reminded me of my Mom's homemade recipe.  The buns taste like a potato bun and they are nicely toasted but nothing special.

French fries are just OK.  could be frozen, i don't know. They are cooked well but nothing special.  Mine were a little greasy.  The onion rings were a big disappointment.  The first order was cold.  I mean like they had been in the refrigerator cold. They cooked us another order but by that time we were halfway through our dogs.  They were very greasy and not all that good anyway.

We got a couple dogs to go and i like the to-go containers.  Kept them safe and sound all the way home.

Bottom line is they make a good hot dog, everything else seems to suffer.  If I go back I will try the sausages, they had a pretty good selection.  If you are into crazy topping combinations and locally brewed beer on the roof, then this is probably your place."}
{"text":"Nice people. Good Hot Dogs. AWSOME house made chips. Great place to chill with a date or with family."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and never had a bad visit. The food is delicious! The service was just ok, but nothing bad. The atmosphere is inviting. Good prices! I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to JJ's yesterday expecting an average dog - not knowing what we were getting into. 

We walked in and were surprised to see an extensive menu of creative hot dogs, brats and sausages (even veggie options) that could make your mouth water! The prices were right - two dollars for the dog of the day and 3-4 dollars for other menu hot dogs. I got the Sonoran which had beans, salsa and a cilantro lime cream. It was so delicious I ordered another! My husband had the mac daddy (mac and cheese on your dog!) 

We both walked away satisfied and FULL! - But wanting more :)"}
{"text":"Yes, they are hot dogs, if hot dogs can be art. 

Used to live in the area, had to limit myself or I'd have been here every night. 

The creative dogs, the onion rings and the service are all great. Eat here."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly and the food is out of site.  The sausage dogs are great.  They also have a veggie dog option which is nice."}
{"text":"Solid hot dog spot in the Queen City, JJ's never disappoints! Everything is fresh and the hot dog combinations are always tasty! There are also sausages, as well as some fish and vegetarian options on the board as well! 

I always either get the quarter hounder or the special pimento dog from Sycamore brewery. Neither will disappoint! As for sides, you can get fries, tots, onion rings, a side salad, etc. and no matter what you get, they are quite generous on their side portion! They also have a pickle bar to compliment any dog and soda/beer to wash the deliciousness down! 

Definitely a great lunch spot in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"This place serves up some excellent wieners (and sausages), but an excellent wiener doesn't automatically insure an excellent hot dog - whatever version you're having - one of their Signature Hot Dogs, or one you choose to build yourself. The wiener is only part of the composition of a great hot dog, the most important part, but still just a part. The roll, the toppings (individually and collectively), cooking method, and finally the assembly process itself will determine the ultimate pedigree of the dog - Best of Breed, Mutt, or something in between.

We tried 3 Signature Hot Dogs - JJ's \"No.1\" Red Hot, The Char Heel, and The Joliet Jake (Chicago Style) - and I was underwhelmed with all 3 from the point of view of taste, texture, and composition. The very first think you notice when you unwrap the dog (any one of them) is the omnipresence of the color yellow (check out the photos) - the mustard, rather sharp mustard at that, is applied last, and with a heavy hand. On the first 2 Signature Dogs we tried, the mustard is applied to a large layer of slaw, and these 2 items overwhelm all other aspects of the hot dog - the excellent wiener gets lost, as do the other toppings, which are fairly small quantities to begin with - in fact, I don't know if I like their chili or not, never found enough to taste. These 2 dogs cost $3.49.

The Joliet Jake ($3.99) is not an outstanding version of the Chicago style dog. There were no whole Sports Peppers, the tomato was limited, and the Pickle Relish was bland, and the deli mustard was applied last and too liberally for my taste. I do not care for Potato Rolls, in general, and this one didn't change that opinion. All in all, these heavy hot dogs are overpriced, and do not rock you with flavor, mainly for the reasons mentioned. I would not order any of the 3 dogs we tried as they were served.

I went back, and ordered a simple dog with Sauerkraut and mustard, with the mustard applied before the kraut, and this was a very good dog, showcasing the excellent wiener, but cost $3.99 - very much over-priced. I don't consider this a hot dog destination kind of place, especially not in the Charlotte area, which boasts a number of outstanding dogs, include the Southern Chili Dog at Green's Lunch, a variety of good dogs by The Chili Man, and a number of very good Chicago Dog choices, including the outstanding one at Poppa's in Mooresville.

I imagine this place could do very well, it is the trendy kind of place some folks flock to - look at the success of Skippy's and their Pretzel bun in Winston - but I'll probably not be one of the flock here. Love the wiener, love that it is grilled, but the dog as a whole is another thing."}
{"text":"First off, let it be known that I am a former Western New Yorker and a Buffalonian and apparently the owner of JJ's is too, so points already in my book. Next, they served Sahlen's hot dogs which are the best hot dogs and taste amazing. Now, while I was hoping this would be a very close replica to what is Ted's in WNY, it is not and I am pleased with the differences. It is very clean and spacious on the inside with a very neat decor if you will.  They take pride in the little details, especially presentation. They have a variety of dog styles on the menu ranging from Buffalo to Chicago to NC and everything is freshly made. They have different beer and food specials throughout the week and I look forward to going back to try another style dog until I get the menu covered, I love hot dogs. I was disappointed that they didn't serve fries ( I was really craving some cheese fries) and tried the chips instead. I am not a chip fan to begin with, and these didn't change my mind. However, the onion rings were very good and nicely done. The staff could be a little more enthusiastic considering there was quite a bit of hype around the opening of this restaurant and make more of an effort to engage with the customer and educate them on the menu."}
{"text":"It's fine - it's a hotdog place.  I have been a few times and never been wow'd by the place.  It's also hard being next door to Lebowski's and not go into Lebowski's to eat.

I do hope the place lasts because the location seems to be cursed, since restaurants don't last long there."}
{"text":"Love JJ's! Gourmet dogs, great sides, rooftop sesting. Great staff! If you're a hot dog lover you must visit JJ's. Chili Cheese and Carolina Dogs are our faves!"}
{"text":"I do love a good dog! Yep, I'll say I'm a fan of JJ's. The Char Heel is my go to dog but I like their coney dog too. They've got good selection of beers as well as fountain drinks. Most of the time I'll get mine to go but the seating inside is nice. I still haven't been to the roof top dining area. Need to try that in the spring. Could be a good place for some after work drinks or maybe some even some day drinking. Ha!"}
{"text":"This was my first trip to JJ's Red Hots. I ordered the Charheel with onion rings as my side. I loved the hotdogs, but didn't like the onion rings that much. They were a little soggy. 

I thought the decor of the building was very trendy and cool. The staff was very helpful and were able to help us with deciding what to order. I loved that they had Cheerwine. Let me say, it went awesomely with my Carolina style hotdogs. 

I see a lot of positives about the onion rings, so I may give them another chance. Other than that, it was a great visit. I'll be stopping by again for sure!"}
{"text":"Always fast and good service. Very clean and very nice staff. I ordered the dirty jerz with fries and a drink. Came up to 7.50 a little steep but food is good. Will come back"}
{"text":"JJ's is by far my favorite and most-frequented fast casual restaurant in Charlotte. Their fancy hotdogs are amazing - grilled hotdogs with all the best toppings. My favorite is the Southern Girl - pimento cheese, chili, bacon crumbles, and mustard atop an all beef frank. They also have great sides and even have vegan options and salads. 

They offer a free pickle bar, have coloring sheets and crayons for kids, offer a rooftop deck with picnic tables (so you can bring your dog), have ample parking, and have super reasonable prices (a fancy dog, side, and drink combo is under $10.00). Join their loyalty program and expect discounted dogs, free drinks, and premium access to specials! 

They were recently featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives and the famous Guy Fieri paid them a visit. You should too - you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"An amazing place! The hot dogs are out of this world, the design/decor is great and the service is fast. Pickle bar is fabulous but needs a dill option. 

Give it a try. Wish there was one in Atlanta. I like it so much I will make sure we stop in every time we are in Charlotte."}
{"text":"They put bacon on a hot dog. 

That fact alone was enough to make my dinner special. Those are two of my favorite fatkid things AND they were on the same bun.  It was like that 2chainz song, but actually good.

All the beer is selected to compliment the hot dogs, I had a NODA something or other,  recommended by the cashier. 

He was right, it was a good move.
I'll likely be back."}
{"text":"All of the previous ravings remain the same. If you haven't been yet, go. Like, right now. Get in the car and go find your bliss in the form of hot dogs and onion rings. There's even another location in Ballantyne now, so if you're not near East Blvd, you still don't have an excuse. If you keep missing this representation of heaven on earth, it's your own fault. I'm on your team, so I only want the best for you and this is the one of the best places to do a hot dog."}
{"text":"Delicious food and fun environment! The staff was very friendly and loved our hotdogs."}
{"text":"This was interesting experience, we went in on a Saturday afternoon expecting it to be busy but to our surprise we were first in line. The food took about 5-10 min, which for hotdogs seems like a long time. I ordered a chili cheese dog, upon arrival I was disappointed because the cheese wasn't melted. Cheese just tastes and presents better melted, especially on a hotdog. I was hoping the chili would be hot enough to melt it if I let it sit there long enough but that was a negative. Anyways, the hotdog it's self tasted really good. 
On a side note, the onion rings were disappointing. They tasted like the skins of onions? They were dry, shriveled up and greasy. 
I'm not sure if we just went on an off day but it sure seems like it. At the end of the day it's just hotdogs so I can't be mad. They had other things we wanted to try so if we're in the area we might consider this place again."}
{"text":"Get out here and get you a dog!! They have tons of different kinds that will have you coming back just to try a new one. Don't expect your average everyday backyard hot dog. JJs goes above and beyond to craft up some seriously good dogs. 

JJs is a staple in Charlotte and well deserving of the hype. Customer service is awesome. You order at the counter and they bring the food out to you. Even if you are sitting all the way up top on their rooftop patio!! 

They are constantly dreaming up new flavors so stay tuned to their social media for updates. Their tots are amazing but onion rings were not. Their pictures looks great on the menu but they could work on the final products when they are served. However above all the flavor was on point which is all that really matters to me."}
{"text":"Having been to Buffalo, NY many times in college, I loved getting my Red Hot fix.  I cannot explain it, they're just better than regular hot dogs.

So, while in Charlotte, I figured I had to hit up some Red Hot dogs.  This place did NOT disappoint.  Lots of great combination Red Hots and Sausage options.  

Try everything. We each got something different, and I was impressed with every combo I saw.  Onion rings are great too. 

Service is friendly.  Place is clean.  I will be back when I'm in Charlotte next time."}
{"text":"OMG  - 

I  enjoyed myself !! 

Im a Jersey Girl so naturally I am in love with hot dogs of all kinds. 

JJ's Red Hots is amazing. The Hot dogs are fair .. but I know I can be biased... because no one .. and I do mean no one... can ever make me a better HOT DOG than Grey's Papaya.... But their no longer in business.... and their in NYC so... next best choice.... JJ's Red Hots. 

Ambiance... Love it love it love it.... why???? - well I love to eat outdoors, and JJ's is situated on a busy street with spots for people watching... The beer is cold and local an the sun is usually hot on the top deck... 

Frowns: - The first time I went here I was under the impression these hot dogs were all beef ( another northern thing) - they arent ... and that's why I think the taste is just fair... 

The second time I tried the dogs, ... I specifically ordered a beef hot dog!!!!! Ureka!!!!!

So long story short.. this is a very fun and mildly friendly place... you, your friend and your kids will love this place...."}
{"text":"Craving for a hot dog and want one that has more than Sam's Club or Costco has to offer?  COME. HERE.  Roofio would say that this place is BANGARANG!

You'll find this place in it's own still standing building, and sometimes you'll see that King of Pops is in front as well.  Yummolicious!  Just be prepared to that this place has a small parking lot.  I couldn't tell you where else you can park cause I've always been lucky enough to get a parking spot.

When you walk in, you can just order and pay at the counter.  I seem to always get the same thing, the Chili Cheese Coney, and I NEVER regret ordering it.  I seriously need to venture out and try all the other items on the menu, but my husband does that so I just steal bits of his order cause...marriage.  Try ordering a side of their fries and add the chili and cheese.  Yum yum.  When I order just one dog and a side, I always feel full as it hits the stomach just right.

They have dining inside where there are booths, and high tops.  There is also outside dining right near the door, and also on the rooftop!  If it's nice out, I suggest to sit outside on the rooftop as it's a nice view, and I like watching the traffic go bye while eating.

All in all, definitely check this place out.  Heck, it's also been visit by Guy Fieri and featured on Diners Drive-Ins and Dives if that tells you anything."}
{"text":"I have had hot dogs at the most famous delis in NYC and seriously folks, JJ'S Red Hots on East Blvd. has a much wider selection and over the top YUM!  My first time there was a lunch today and I cannot wait until I am in Charlotte again to try some of their other choices.  Staff was friendly and even the manager, Scott, came over to chat with us."}
{"text":"Eat your dog on the upstairs patio overlooking East Boulevard. Try not to taunt the runners going by as you stuff your face with hot dogs, cheese fries, and onion rings. 

There are so many choices of specialty dogs, but you can build your own too. Tell the cashier that it's your first time and he/she will do a great job explaining how ordering works and give some great recommendations. 

They have a bar which includes add-ons like pickled onions, jalapenos, and \"Ogre Sauce\" which tastes like hot dogs, interestingly. 

Prices are decent. For less than $19 we ordered a one-dog platter, a two-dog platter, and a soft drink. Each platter came with a side. That's about how much we'd pay if we went to Chipotle, and we got more for our money."}
{"text":"Delicious hot dogs and really great spot. Love the menu & all of their options. Free kids hot dog in the summer! That's a treat for parents so we can use that extra money for beer! ;)

Love the king of pops too & the staff here is very friendly."}
{"text":"Can't beat JJ's for the best dogs in town!  Love the Char Heel and the German bratwurst with sauerkraut, yum yum.  The homechips are a must and the side salad was even delicious.  An excellent choice for lunch or dinner any day of the week.  We frequent this local hotspot a few times a month and are never disappointed."}
{"text":"Tried out JJ's on Friday, during opening week.   I'm not a huge hot dog fan because places like this are usually fried food centric.  However, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the two dogs I got.  Char Heel and Whistle Pig.  Both were phenomenal.  I ordered the onion rings as a side and hand mand lemonade - fantastic. 

I'm very excited to try the rest of the menu - Must try this place."}
{"text":"I guess the confused looks on our faces gave it away that we were first-timers! The cashier warmly greeted us and gave us a thorough introduction to the menu. This place does hot dogs (and other things) every way imaginable. All of the hot dogs have cute names. Hubby and I both went for the Char Heel Dog that had house-made chilli, slaw, diced onions (we skipped because we both had to go back to work) and yellow mustard. And you can get an all-beef dog! We both made ours combos; fries with cheese for me and tater tots for the hubby. Everything tasted great. And...they give a discount to CHS employees. Score!"}
{"text":"A contender in any hot dog competition is JJ's Red Hots. For some reason my girlfriend has me craving hot dogs on a regular basis now and I have to say I have found the Charlotte, NC Madison Square Garden when it comes to dogs. Today I indulged in The Whistle Pig, all I can say is the 23 minutes and 19 seconds riding in the car to get here was well worth the 3 minutes it took me to eat the dog (I devour food). The dog is bigger than some sandwiches I have seen. It had the \"snap\" every dog should have on the first bite and it was also soooo flavorful. I mean I can actually taste the hot dog with all the toppings I had. The ambiance of JJ's Red Hots is awesome. The dining room is nice and open with tons of natural light. Its very inviting. Even though I was unable to make it to the roof it looked spectacular and comfortable.  I will most definitely be back to have a beer and a dog chillin' on top of the roof. If your in Charlotte you must stop by JJ's Red Hots"}
{"text":"When you're in the mood for a hot dog, and you all know what I mean, JJ's is the spot to satisfy the craving!  The menu looks quite small, but each dog hits the spot.  My favorite is the Char Heel, all beef hot god, cole slaw, chili, onions and cheese. A traditional dog, but it always hit the spot.
I recently tried the corn dogs, OMG, those are wrong. And when I say wrong, I mean so right, but definitely can be addicting.  JJ's offers beer and wine and has a great condiment bar with pickled veggies that always add a nice treat to any dog.
Don't forgot to check out JJ's, especially the rooftop patio when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"This is my favorite hot dog spot! Their house pickles are the best!
My daughter came for a visit so I had to show her some of Charlotte's best!"}
{"text":"Great location, hot dogs are impeccable, house chips are the bomb.com, and don't even get me started on the pickle bar! JJ's is my go to lunch spot. They create such unique flavor combos and always get me to step outside of my box when need be (peanut butter on a dog, mango salsa, etc). I think everyone should try JJ's at least once. You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"I'd been reading the Talk Thread \"JJ's Dog of the Week - We Need Your Ideas to Create the Yelp dog!\" https://www.yelp.com/topic/charlotte-jjs-dog-of-the-week-we-need-your-ideas-to-create-the-yelp-dog and loved the sound of the new Yelp Dog. Grilled beef dog on a pretzel bun with beer queso, sauerkraut, mustard and sweet sauteed onions.

And it took me until Saturday to get there, but the wait was worth it. The dog was tasty and super fattening and very messy. The queso and the pretzel bun were awesome, but about three quarters of the way through, it collapsed. Still, very tasty.

Get a seat upstairs if the weather is great!"}
{"text":"Love it!  Food is great... expensive, but you know what they corner the market, because after you eat one you will want another one and another one and what spot (other than the grocery store) do you know where you can get a good hotdog. Its worth it though.  I got the Italian sausage with mustard and onions, delicious, Enjoy."}
{"text":"It is what it is: A hot dog joint. But they do it really well and with a cool atmosphere. People seem to expect too much out of it... the Hot dogs are great."}
{"text":"This is a cool restaurant!! After a fun day at freedom park, we decided to grab hot dogs and cold sodas! There were quite a few people in line but it moved rather quickly.  We sat on the inside which was well kept and clean.  There is, however, outside seating on the roof which is nice as well. The staff was friendly and served the food promptly.  

I ordered the char hill which was extremely good!! It's the standard hot dog (homemade chilli, slaw, mustard, and onions).  They loaded my hot dog with mustard, so if you're not fond of it, please take heed or tell them light mustard.  My dog costs only 3.99 which is reasonable to me because of the quality!  I've also had JJ's No. 1 \"red hot\" which was great as well and has a little kick to it.  For this hot dog (and many others) there is a vegetarian option available.  It's labeled on the menu which hot dogs offer this option.

I found it neat that this restaurant was on the show Diners, drive-ins, and dives and they have daily specials!!!  I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Love me a good Hot Dog, I don't think I got the full JJ's experience. I didn't even see half the dogs that were advertised at our table on the flip chart with photos. You can also only use one promotion when you come in  - I had an offer for BOGO hot dogs and onion rings and had to choose one - so I haven't got to have the rings yet....sad days!

I'll be back again and will get the full experience and update this review!"}
{"text":"Their dog pairings with craft beer is nothing short of phenomenal. They have a great text rewards program to rack up points and their daily specials and drink specials makes it a perfect excuse to go for a quick dinner when I don't feel like cooking."}
{"text":"Hotdogs.  A staple in Amercia's pastime.  JJ's does them justice.  I'm talkin' real dogs y'all.

If you're looking for a chill place to have an old-fashioned hotdog, this is your joint.  Order your dog traditional style, or go with one of their fancy takes.  You can also build your own.  They have a few other options to choose from as well, including sausages, salmon sliders, etc.  Take your tykes because they have little dog choices too.  

The rooftop patio is a fun spot to eat if the weather is nice.  Be sure to stop by the pickle bar for a variety of housemate pickles.  Onion rings. Yes.  Fries.  Of course.  They even have a King of Pops cooler to satisfy your sweet tooth!

Hotdogs have gotten a bad rap over the years.  Don't view the hotdog as the underdog.  Go get your weiner on at JJ's!"}
{"text":"JJ's is not exactly a haven for the vegetarian contingent, but they have made some great strides in creating a hot dog place that's veggie friendly. I've been coming here since before the grand opening, and have been pleased on every turn.

I appreciate that they tried on their menu at the beginning, saw what worked and what didn't, and made a few changes. I didn't mind the loss of fries, since the chips are really quite good. I was disappointed at first to find they didn't have a vegetarian \"dog\" on the menu, but upon hearing that they weren't pleased with any mainstream offerings and hadn't created one in-house that they would be stoked to serve, I could handle the wait. When they finally created the \"veJJie,\" I tried it and am hooked. It's sautéed portobello, onion and peppers on a toasted bun with their KILLER aioli (or whatever they call it). It's a delicious combination and I am SO glad they didn't settle for a flaky, sub-par, tofu-esque creation.

As for the meaty offerings, all I hear are good things from the Mr. about the new sausage creations -- namely the Merguez, debuted at Sausagefest (an event I attended purely for the unlimited craft beer sampling). The Char Heel, JJ's #1 and Chicago are also big hits according to my sources.

There are other menu selections I enjoy trying from time to time...the onion rings are a worthy choice, salads are good (i loved the seasonal one with goat cheese from the summer), beer selection is better than you'd expect for a quick-casual place, and the orangeade and lemonades are totally refreshing and delicious. A perfect complement to the heavier entree items.

Oh, and the other day they had a butternut squash soup that was perfectly executed. Thanks!!

I love the rooftop seating, and their effort to create a fun, casual environment through having live music acts nearly every weekend. Also impressive is the fact that they make everything except the Sahlen's dogs IN HOUSE. And everything possible is NC sourced. For a semi-locavore like myself, that is definitely noteworthy. I think JJ's has some staying power in the community and look forward to their continued presence.

All in all, this isn't a prime spot for vegetarians, but it's a worthy lunch spot or quick dinner locale, especially if you're hitched to a hot dog or sausage lover (or have a pile of hungry kids to feed).

**Make sure when ordering that you are EXTRA specific with any alterations to the prescribed dog condiments, etc. Occasionally orders come out just shy of what you order...but that's generally supplemented by stellar customer service on the redo."}
{"text":"I love their homemade pickled options! I got the Veggie Sonoran and the Veggie Joliet Jake. They used the same veggie dogs I get in my grocery store, so that wasn't a surprise. The toppings were amazing! The atmosphere is great! I loved the dogs too. The homemade chips were good and their homemade ranch was ok. Overall it's an awesome restaurant."}
{"text":"Yummy hotdogs, yummy toppings. Glad they finally got combos added to their menu, it's a bit pricey for the size dog you get but the combo adds a better deal now. Yummy pickle bar. The carrots with ginger is awesome!! Yummy crinkle fries.
YUMMY!"}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for a tasty frank...try out JJ's. I went after the lunch crowd and was thoroughly pleased...plus I got a free side order of tater tots. That makes me happy! Lol"}
{"text":"I have seriously never been very adventurous with hot dogs. Honestly a bum and ketchup is all I need. I don't even like mustard. Booo I know I'm boring. However I was pleasantly surprised to have the pleasure of trying JJ's Red Hots at a yelp event. For someone who normally does not like mustard, both dogs that were offered had mustard on them. Oh man and did I scarf them down like no tomorrow. Today I had the pleasure of having anything on the menu on them as a thank you to veterans. The quarter hounder, and was it delicious! Bacon, queso, lettuce, tomato. With a drink and side of fresh house made chips served with ranch. I ate every bite! So far it's my third dog there, and I plan on trying all of them. The signature is awesome. Mustard, relish, onions and a dill pickle spear. And I will say this is not how I would normally want my hot dogs. I've also had the whistle pig with bacon, onions, mustard, and shredded cheese. To all hot dog fans you must try this place. They are all also very nice here and it's almost like your at home. Thanks for the meal JJ's! I will be back."}
{"text":"If you're a fan of hot dogs and you haven't been to JJ's, what are you waiting on?

The service is friendly and helpful, and the place is clean and inviting. You order at the counter when you walk in and then they'll bring the food to your table. 

They do have beer options available, including draft beer--and they have drink specials throughout the week. 

Food is delicious, there are so many options and unique flavor profiles on their menu. The sides are just as tasty as the dogs! There is also a weekly special and they offer daily specials--including $2 dogs on Tuesday!"}
{"text":"For some reason I am always hesitant to go to JJ's, because \"it's just hot dogs\", but every time I go, I never regret it.

I have gotten a few different hot dogs, but the Chicago is my favorite.  It just has a ton of 'stuff' on it, so lots of good things are happening with each bite.  For a side, I highly recommend their chips, which are seasoned, crispy, and served with a nice side of ranch dressing for dipping.

The atmosphere/seating is really nice as well.  You can sit in a booth or at high tables.  The tables are also huge and have great views of the televisions.  JJ's would probably be a good place to enjoy some hot dogs and watch some baseball games...or any other sport.

I also loved the amount and variety of condiments/pickled vegetables.  Nice compliment to the meal.

Overall, the food, service, and atmosphere are quality, and it is relatively inexpensive.  I will definitely make some more visits back here."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I decided to check them out after coming across a free hot dog coupon in the Knights baseball program.

I got the Quarter Hounder (queso, bacon lettuce, tomato, special sauce) and a create your own (sauerkraut, queso, bacon, chili) with a side of homemade chips (with homemade ranch dipping sauce). I would get both again no question about it. The hot dogs casing had the perfect grilled snap when you bite into one and the buns are the perfect length so that you don't have any bites of just bread.

The staff was very helpful (and patient as it took us entirely too long to decide on our order as everything sounded good). They were very flexible with the coupon as well. They have a variety of seating areas to choose from.. Indoor AC area, some patio seating on the ground floor and a rooftop patio. After you place your order you take a number with you to your table and the food is brought out to you. Out food was brought out without minutes of sitting down and everything tastes warm and fresh!

Definitely will be back. It certainly does not hurt that there is a King of Pops cart in the parking lot to grab some dessert on your way out either.."}
{"text":"I was actually disappointed after visiting this place. I had heard so many good things about this place by the time I tasted my food I wondered if I had the wrong location. I had a chili cheese dog that somehow pretty bland. The fries were fine. The service was okay. I did like the design on the inside though. The hot dogs are Vienna style, which is much different than Nathan's which is what I usually prefer. I don't see myself going out of the way to go back like I did before."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try these folk forever! Finally my husband and I checked them out today. The hotdogs were great and the service was wonderful. We really enjoyed ourselves. Great laid back place with yummy hotdogs as well!"}
{"text":"I've seen many a place come and go in this location, but JJ Red Hots seems to be a good fit.  If you are a fan of hot dogs, this is the place to be since JJ's has a ton of specialized hot dogs for your enjoyment.  

What also pretty awesome about JJ's is that you can order a beer with your hot dog!  They have bottles on the wall (rotating) as well as a good local draft selection.  Nothing beats a good dog and a brew!

The vibe of the place is very cool with vintage posters and a light fixture made out of a drum set.  Everything is kept super clean and maintained by the friendly staff.

The last dog I had here was pretty good: The Sonoran (Southwestern Style).  Its got Borracho Beans, Fire-grilled salsa, red onion, cilanto lime creme, and shreadded cheese.  It's as if you were craving some taco bell, classed it up, and on a hot dog instead.  Yum!  There is also the option of building your own dog - which I have not been brave enough to do yet."}
{"text":"Hot DAWG!  This place has the best hot dogs I've ever tasted.  

JJ's Red Hots is a fast casual restaurant for Hot dog, sausage and chili lovers.  Oh yeah, they also have salads but if you come here for a salad without trying the dogs first, there's something wrong.

I thought that when I ordered, they would take an already cooked dog and just add my desired toppings but no you get a freshly cooked dog which is why it takes a little longer.  They have various names for their dogs with various toppings including the standard, ketchup, mustard, relish, onions, chili and more.  And put them in any combo.

But it's not the toppings that stand out, it's the dog itself.  They are cooked long enough to give them a nice brown color and a great smoky flavor.  Toppings for the Carolina and Jersey dogs were good.  For the Jersey dog, I should have added some hot sauce to cut the sweetness of the relish a bit.  But otherwise it was quite tasty.

If you order the combo, your meal comes with a drink and your choice of 4 sides.  I went with the onion rings which were thin and had a nice kick to them.

They also sell beer, both bottled and local drafts and have a few wine selections.  

Around the restaurant, the decor is black and red.  There is an old drum set turned into a light fixture in the dining room.  There's 2 TV's, several booths, tables and a 12 seater pub table.  They also have a small patio out back and the deck on top of the restaurant.   The staff is super friendly here and seemed to go out of their way to help you understand the menu and bring you things that you may have forgotten, like napkins.

In a space that has been so many restaurants in a short time, I think this might be the one that sticks around for a while.  At least I hope they do!"}
{"text":"Y'all this is how I know I need a vacation! How could I not have reviewed one of my favorite places! When it comes to hot dogs... you should have this place on the list. 

I usually visit this place on a nice day so I can enjoy the upstairs patio, which gives you a view of East Blvd. The parking lot isn't too big so if you're up for it, I suggest including this day with a walk from Freedom Park...or you can get away with parking in the FedEx lot momentarily if you're just running in and out. 

The range for two people is about $14-$21... the latter usually includes beer. The order is grilled fresh so don't worry... you're not getting a hot dog that's been steaming and sitting in water. 

Overall this place is awesome! And I've never been here and there wasn't an option to grab an icee/ice cream at the outside cart. Come show this place some love, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"JJ's is the place to go for hot dog love in Charlotte and I can only hope that plans are in the works for a north of town LKN location (JJ, you listening?  We finally got Midwood Smokehouse to come and I'd say there is very little hot dog competition by the lake with a slight nod going to Matt's Chicago Dog in Cornelius).

There are many beautiful things about JJ's... The first is the Sahlen's dogs they use and how they char them just right before hitting the bun.  The second thing they get right are the myriad of choices for toppings on these lovely charred tube steaks of joy.  So many pre-thought out and yummy combinations of ingredients with my two current favorites being the Char Heel and the Quarter Hounder.  Don't like being put in a predetermined box?  JJ's has you covered with a build your own option.  Same thing if you don't eat beef (go Turkey Dog) or don't eat meat (Veggie Dog it is!).

If all this is not enough, they make their own sausages of differing varieties and the sides are homemade and delicious to boot.  The kicker.  One of the cutest logo's ever."}
{"text":"This place gets such good reviews and my friends referred me here. This was my first time. I have to say - not a fan. The hot dog was basic tasting and everything on the menu looked gross. I have had better hot dogs off of the hot dog cart in NYC at the park. 

Not worth the boooooginess of it all and the parking is miserable. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"In town for a visit and came across this place. Delicious! I had the whistle pig. Also, the ginger carrots by the toppings are a good choice."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place, I really did. 
Best thing I had was the cherry coke 
Hot dog meat was forgettable, chili was blamd, buns dry.
Good quality cheese thou.
Cool staff, clean place."}
{"text":"Came into JJ's last night for their all-you-can-eat hot dog special occurring on select Thursday nights.  I arrived an grabbed a table on their upstairs patio.  It was a perfect afternoon/evening and the patio is a great outdoors space.  Conveniently, the hot dog was set-up out there.

On the bar were buns, hot dogs, chili, baked beans, relish, pickles, brown mustard, onions, and shredded cheese.

For $6 it was a great deal.  Our great stayed for the whole time the bar was out (5-8) and had a gluttonous amount of hot dogs.  The dogs themselves were very good.  The buns are thick potato buns which I normally very much enjoy but they are extremely filling.  The chili on the bar had an odd after taste for me.  I wish there was slaw on the bar too to do the full carolina dog.

I tried the onion rings which had a nice spicy crust.

PBR was $2 and they had them cold and for sale upstairs which made everything easy.

I'd definitely return to JJ's to try some of their more unusual dogs but the hot dog bar was a huge hit for me and my friends."}
