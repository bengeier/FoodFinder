{"text":"The good:

-The pork fried rice was great!  It was fresh, and made with lots of vegetables.

-The food was prepared very quickly.


The bad:

-The menu is small, and they are not willing to make substitutions.

-The place was closed almost every time I had the hankerin' for Chinese..."}
{"text":"Way over priced for cheap, Chinese food. It might be ok for college kids but, I won't give it another try. The hot & sour soup was pretty good. Average veggie egg roll, but horrible chicken curry. It had a weird, bitter taste, almost like soap. The broccoli was just gross. So disappointing."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Atmosphere nice. A fountain drink is like $2.50 so don't let the modest food price fool you. And the biggest complaint, they have the cheapest plastic silver wear you could possibly find. So annoying."}
{"text":"Solid Chinese joint serving up Chinese food.  Ok, by Chinese I mean very mild flavored Americanized Chinese food - but still.  Restaurant is pretty small and clean, never seems to be too busy.  

Like I said the food is pretty mild but in a good way.  They do a good job of keeping things simple, white rice, some veggies, entree.  Just the right amount of sauce too so you can spread it around but not overwhelming.  Seems like they are trying to keep it relatively healthy at least it tastes a lot healthier to me compared to other Chinese style restaurants."}
{"text":"I love this place I have eaten here several times and the food is always fresh and this restaurant is very clean.  So far everything that I have tried has been excellent.  I hope they can stay in business as they never seem to be very busy."}
{"text":"Tried this place twice now, First time 3 weeks ago, and again last night.
We ordered Sesame Chicken ($8.99), Orange Chicken ($8.99), and Cream Cheese Wantons ($3.99). 2 Egg Rolls ($2.50)
The portions are really small. Extremely small for the price. 
The meals come with a large clump of overcooked plain white rice, vegetables in a sweet sauce (literally 5 paper thin carrot slices, 7 1/2\" asparagus butt pieces, and 3 tiny broccoli heads), and a clump of small chicken pieces, 9 to be exact.
All 3 items took up about 1/3 of a normal plate at best. Each dish seemed to be cooked sometime in the morning, and left to die in a warmer tray all day. Everything was overcooked by far. Chicken was hard and dried out. Rice was clumpy and old.
The wantons were burnt. Egg Rolls were clearly from frozen and heated hours ago.
The only good thing is they are within walking distance of ASU downtown campus, otherwise I assume they would be long closed by now.
Also, their prices are much more than the yelp menu states, at least 20% more.
Don't even bother trying to use the plastic forks. Bring your own. They are the thinnest and cheapest I have ever seen.
Pass on this one."}
{"text":"They sell delicious food! The staff is always friendly and they always get my orders right. This is a great place! I always come back."}
{"text":"I've had better chinese for the price they sell it for. My friends like their fried rice. It's not my favorite at all. I have stopped going there."}
{"text":"I stopped in on my lunch and had the beef fried rice with some sesame chicken and beef cabbage soup.  The beef fried was very good and a good portion. The sesame chicken was slightly crispy with a sweet taste and the beef cabbage soup was done well. All this at a affordable price... Hsin Cafe, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Good healthy new place, and inexpensive.  A nice addition to downtown.  Love the nicely prepared vegetables (baby bok choy, and still nicely crunchy!), and the addition of fruit is nice.  And they added steamed tofu to the menu!  The shrimp with tomato is my favorite."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch. The restaurant is clean and service prompt and friendly. I order the spicy chicken. which has good flavor . Along with chow mein  and boba milk tea . Chow mein has lots veggies stir fried in. Milk tea boba is pretty good."}
{"text":"Overall a really nice place. The food is amazing. I recommend the eggs rolls, chow mein, and orange chicken. The place is nice and comfortable to eat in. I am defiantly going back!"}
{"text":"Fast, FRESH and delicious with friendly and attentive service! Seriously, I'm so glad this restaurant opened- I work and go to school nearby and it is so awesome to be able to run in and get this yummy and healthy food to go.
Keep up the good work Hsin Cafe!"}
{"text":"I'm a visitor in town for a convention and I stumbled upon this place on yelp.  Just the location alone is awesome.  Really convenient to get to.  I've been here twice so far and have been more than satisfied with my food.  It's fresh and good.  Lastly the price wasn't bad at all either.  They are pretty reasonable and I give them credit for not trying to take advantage of the tourist or college students.  I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Good food, owner was very friendly and kind. Sesame chicken was very good!  Will be back."}
{"text":"Good spot for a quick lunch or dinner. The food is good. The space is relaxing. I've had the chow mein, some of the dinner plates and the pork and egg roll apps. Never disappointed. I also appreciate that they will accept special requests. (I like the chow mein with extra veggies and few noodles.)

Hsin fills a hole for Chinese food in downtown.

My only complaint is their Ice Tea. Then need to change beverage vendors or start making the tea in house. This is AZ. There is no excuse for crummy ice tea."}
{"text":"College student living in Taylor place, was hungry so I decided to grab a bite that was something other than the dining hall. 9$ for the orange chicken plate, a little pricey I thought, but it was M&G so I didn't really care. When I got back up to my room to eat, I was appalled by the amount of food I got, I'd maybe pay $7 at most for it. But I thought whatever, hopefully it tastes good. And I was appalled again, the chicken was bland and fairly tasteless, even drenched in sauce, the veggies were meh, and the rice seemed like it was made at 6 am this morning and it's 4:45 pm, mind you. Anyways, I don't recommend it personally, and I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I love this place! I'm an ASU downtown student and its perfect for a quick, healthy meal. I can get grilled chicken, veggies, and brown rice. The place is always clean and the service is always GREAT. Plus they gave me 10% off for no reason today. I'll take it! 
Oh, and they have a really good green peach iced tea too. 
I have never had a bad experience here, and I'll miss it when I graduate!"}
{"text":"I love this cafe! Dined there three times and fantastic every time. Food is made to order, and hot. Clean place with nice decor and music. Unique teas and other beverages in the cooler. Great!"}
{"text":"Looking for a banging Chow mein??! This is the place, I cannot vouch for anything else at this place but their Chow Mein!! It is incredibly addictive!!
When you order it, you can hear the cook shaking and tossing that wok!! 
It is simply delicious and the best AZ has to offer! 
You can find this gem tucked away in the ASU building, next to their cafeterias outdoor seating!"}
{"text":"Came in today.  No soy out by the soda station. Darn, reach to a table. Made my connection with the shuttle. Chicken chow mein was great, I enjoyed it on the bus. Lots of love. Little pricey for what you're selling, but I'd still come back."}
{"text":"First off, I am such a picky eater, especially when it comes to asian food.....but this was sooo yummmy! I plan on coming here at least once a week. Not only was the food delicious, but the workers were very friendly! I def recommend!"}
{"text":"I am in Phoenix on business, and this was the closest Chinese carry-out to my hotel.  Best I've had in a LONG time.  The Spicy Chicken featured tender white chicken, fresh tender-crisp vegetables and a tasty light sauce that didn't overpower the dish.  I highly recommend Hsin Cafe, and may go back tomorrow before heading home to North Carolina!  Competitiverob"}
{"text":"so, apparently i can't read or maybe i was too excited for the elite event at PBS studios, but i thought i read that the event started at 6pm. wrong. so there we were, 30 minutes early because i am exceptionally gifted at reading. knowing that there wasn't much open nearby and hearing the rumbling in our stomachs, the boyfriend suggested that we hit up Hsin for some tasty spicy chicken. we walked across the street, walked right in, and found a very friendly man at the register looking at us quizzically. apparently my reading ineptitude was contagious because bf walked me right past a sign that said \"Summer Hours 9 - 6pm\". they were closed, but the nice gentleman behind the counter was extremely nice and said that he could serve us anyway as long as we took it to go. sweet!

we ordered the spicy chicken no bread. it was delicious! tasty chicken, water chestnuts, peppers, bamboo, and an extremely large helping of broccoli made it an extremely filling, tasty, and not so bad for you meal. i couldn't believe that the man was nice enough to whip us some even though he was closed. that alone would always have me coming back but the food was also terrific! Hsin for the win :)."}
{"text":"Had sesame chicken & dumplings. Chicken was tough & tasted bad, through the sauce even! Dumplings were good. Service was good. No bad feelings, but probably wouldn't go back with other options available."}
{"text":"Another day of comfortable shoes, comfortable weather, and a not-so-busy work day. This perfect combination allows me to walk a little farther than normal for lunch. I was in the mood for something new and different. After reading several different reviews on Yelp (see, I told you it was a slow day), I decided on Hsin Cafe. 

The walk over was nice, considering. I witnessed a tire-screeching, almost-accident when someone ran a red light. Luckily, both cars were able to stop and even though I was inches away in the cross walk, I was able to move quickly. Those of you that read my Just My Luck review (http://www.yelp.com/biz/absolutely-just-my-luck-tempe#hrid:T8MQBQpStdP_huSg-BDA_Q) may say it's Karma. I won't argue. 

I arrived at Hsin Cafe around 11:45. They were not very busy. There were two occupied tables and two people that entered behind me. The woman at the counter was friendly and kindly answered all of my questions about the menu. When I asked about the veggie dish, she even offered to put tofu in it. Must have changed their story after Leslie F's review! (Another win for the Yelpers!) 

I ended up with the Pepper Steak and iced tea to go. The steak was good, but not exactly peppery. The red bell peppers and onions with the steak were crisp and yummy. The side of broccoli was decent, plain, but decent. The fruit was a nice addition too. The to-go container had sections, so the fruit didn't get mixed with the sauce, however, I like a little savory with my sweet, so I dipped my apple slice in the left over sauce for the pepper steak. Yum! I still agree with Sean, I would rather have them be separate and choose to dip, rather than have them end up that way regardless. 

Overall, I was pleased with the quality of the food. Sometimes, with other Asian places, you never know what you're going to get. Give me another nice day and if I'm wearing good shoes, I'm there!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst garbage in the planet.
I can't believe this place is i business.
Everything comes out of bags.
Frozen pre made crap.
I took one bite and almost threw up.
My food tastes like chemicals.
Spent $22 took one bite and left.
Please don't eat here.
Your encouraging these clowns to continue there culinary abortion.
Barf."}
{"text":"i have never had a proprietor express such surprise at a random walk-in customer. i'd swear nobody had been in for days.

\"how did you find us?\" as if the place was hidden up a dirt road rather than in downtown phoenix by the convention center.

kooky.

nice guy tho and good prices."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical given the very mixed reviews this place has received. But, I found that the service was friendly and quick, the restaurant was clean despite it being just after the lunch rush and the food was decent. I ordered the orange chicken - it wasn't stellar, but the vegetables were crisp and fresh and the chicken flavorful enough and the price about average. The portion was a tad small for the price compared to other places, but they have the convenience factor on their side which is reflected in their pricing. I would come again."}
{"text":"I came here after being stood up by a co-worker. I'm a flight attendant for a major carrier. Most of the time I do my own thing on overnights. It's very rare for any of us to spend time together once the uniform is off because, for the most part, we just don't fly with anyone we know (there are 26,000 of us in the system). On this particular trip, after we were finished with the service, this FA asked if I had any plans for Phoenix. I said no and yadi yada yada, we made plans for cheap eat at Hsin Cafe after doing a Yelp search. 

5 o'clock the next day, I waited in the hotel lobby for him. 5:20 I rang him up. He said, \"Haaaaalloooo.\" I said, \"Dude, did I wake you? Didn't we have plans for dinner?\" He said, \"Oh Marinara, I'm so sorry. I'll be right down.\" I told him I was starving and he could just meet me there. Marinara? Seriously??

Of course, he never showed up. What a loser. So anyway, as soon as I opened the door to Hsin, this friendly man behind the counter gave me the warmest smile. I knew what I wanted since I had 20 mins a little while ago to read up on some reviews. Their Chow Mein is the most popular raving dish, so I ordered Shrimp Chow Mein and chicken egg roll. I found a table close to the front. It didn't take too long before my food arrived. What was placed in front of me gave me a big smile. My dish was overloaded with shrimps. Everything that a Chow Mein should be was right in front of me. It was indeed a satisfying meal for only $8.25. I was full and I couldn't even eat my egg roll, so I had it to go. 

While I was sitting there, I saw the interaction between the man behind the counter (owner maybe?) and every customers that walked in. He gave them all this genuine smile as they approached the counter. He was just one of the friendliest human beings I've ever encountered. And I'm in the business where I do get to meet a lot of people. Somehow just watching him and listening to him, made being stood up okay. Infact, I was glad I was stood up because I had such a pleasant dinner by myself. 

And to Cee Lo Green Wannabe, if you're reading this, in my 20 years of flying, I've never worked with someone as lame as you. If you're going to invite a co-worker to dinner (and confirming it that very morning), the very least you should do is wake up before 5pm! Also, my name tag doesn't have Marinara written on it!"}
{"text":"Tasty Chinese cafe downtown.. What i loved about this place when you sit down the lady at the front brings your plate. And oh boy is it HOT and FRESH... If your in the downtown phoenix area do not go to panda express. GO to Hsin Cafe and get some tasty hot Chinese food!"}
{"text":"In one word, my carry out lunch experience at Hsin was WEIRD. When I walked in, I was pleasantly surprised by the clean, modern ambiance. It's definitely an upgrade from your traditional Chinese place. But, it was SO hot inside. I felt badly for the two other people who were dining in. With all of the west and south-facing floor to ceiling windows, they really need to pump that AC to combat against the power of the AZ sun. 
Since I'm a vegetarian, the only real option for me was the Veggie Delight.  When I asked the cashier if there was tofu in the dish she replied \"no, because we've found that it's not popular enough with our clients to carry.\"  Ummm...haven't you only been open a week?  How can anything be unpopular yet? In any event, she did go into the back to see if they had tofu lying around because I wasn't going to pay $5.99 for vegetables and rice. Low and behold they did have tofu - yay!  A minute later, the chef came out and asked me if I was a vegetarain.  Turns out they use non-vegetarian friendly oyster sauce in their only non-meat dish.  Once that got sorted out it was only a matter of minutes until I received my order.
Once I opened it, I was a bit perplexed by the apple, kiwi, tomato salad in one corner of the container and the cold broccoli in teriyaki sauce in another corner all sitting on top of my veggie delight entree.  The cold broccoli definitely stood out in a not-so-good way when there was hot broccoli already mixed into the dish.  And tomatoes in a fruit salad? The entree actually tasted good but the rest was strange strange strange."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Been coming here for over three years. The Spicy Chicken is unique because the spice comes from white pepper. The cafe is conveniently located in downtown Phoenix on the ASU campus - convenient if you work/live/attend school downtown. Be advised that the metered parking can be a challenge.

Consistently good food with consistently good service. Fast and reliable, looking forward to coming back again!"}
{"text":"Clean and stylish decor, attentive and eager staff, and tasty and affordable food.  All important hallmarks in the Quick Casual category.  The orange chicken was a noticeable step up from the Panda offering with the chicken being well balanced in terms of sweet and savory.

If I was an ASU student living downtown this would be a regular in my dining rotation.  Well done."}
{"text":"A good spot for a quick bite to eat. The portions on the meal are much larger then the rice bowl. Quick, satisfying and clean!"}
{"text":"My favorite thing to order here is the orange chicken combo. The chicken is cooked to perfection . And the food service is wonder full. Workers ask me if everything is okay and if I need anything else. They have various types of drinks and you can add boba to any drink on the list. I really do recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is place is right by my dorm and it is super convenient! The food is pretty good and it's not a bad price either. I would definitely recommend this place to friends and family!"}
{"text":"Torn between 2 and 3 stars, but giving them the benefit of the doubt. For an affordable and fast Chinese meal, Hsin Cafe does well, but it's really nothing too special. We ordered shrimp fried rice, orange chicken and fried gyoza, and milk tea without boba. I didn't think the food was that good but it was cheap and fast and our experience was not terrible. I would go back in a pinch but not something I highly recommend. It was on par with any generic Chinese fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"Super cozy and comfortable Chinese place in the downtown area within walking distance from my work. The chicken chow main was delicious, my friend didn't like the sesame chicken but said her fried rice was good. I will be taking a trip back here when I need a comfortable, relaxing spot."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Chinese food on an ASU campus!  The service is fantastic, and there are great options for people who are not big into meats and fish!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed the food and friendly customer service!! Not oily at all.
The drinks were tasty. 

Over all, we appreciate the friendly and welcoming customer service!"}
{"text":"Quick. Delicious. Affordable. Amazing crispy dumplings. Pleasant staff. Clean environment."}
{"text":"First time customer review: 

I walked here from a few blocks away around 12:45 PM on Thurday.  The place was dead and only had one table occupied.  I was greeted immediately and the woman asked me if it was my first time, I said yes and she went over the menu and their best sellers, also mentioned the 10% \"discount\" if you pay with cash or credit.  I give them 5 stars for customer service but the food is another story...

Based on reviews I read online I ordered the orange chicken.  So I will say that out of all the orange chicken I have eaten this sauce was decent, it wasnt very sweet and didnt have that bitter orange peel taste that some sauces have, it also was pretty mild in general which I liked because some sauces are just way over powering.  The rice on the other hand tasted like dirt.  I love plain white rice and I dont know what they do to theirs or where they buy it from but its awful.

Bottom line:  I wouldnt recommend this restaurant and I wont be going back.  I paid just over $10 dollars (with a drink) not at all worth it..."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I give it 5 stars for the service and food. The food is really good, especially the orange chicken and beef and broccoli. I love the milk iced tea as well.

It's a very clean place with good food. Tried other places around the area and they were okay, but I like Hsin the best and always come here whenever I am in town."}
{"text":"I've only been once. I had the Veggie Delight with fried rice, which was $1.50 extra. But there was plenty for two meals. I really liked the addition of fruit - a couple of grapes, a slice of strawberry, an apple chunk - in my veggies. It added a pleasant amount of sweetness but not enough to detract from the veggies and rice. 

Overall, the dish tasted clean, light, and delicious. I'll definitely go again."}
{"text":"For the price of the meal (around 8-10 dollars), it is relatively expensive for the amount of food that is given. It is smart for the owners to open up a Asian cafe on the ASU campus but they are ripping everyone off. I also tried their bubble tea. It is not fresh at all. I would not recommend anyone coming here. Save your money and go elsewhere to get more bang for your buck."}
{"text":"They make your order fresh and their drinks are delicious! I got the orange chicken and almond honey milk tea with boba!"}
{"text":"Simple, Inexpensive and within walking distance from my place. I went biking this evening and had the sudden urge to get Chinese food.
I ordered something to go and got a vegetarian dish with tofu. 
From what I've observed, the place is simple and clean. 
Now as far as my dish goes; I thought it was good, but needed more flavor.  (which is a good thing)
It gave me a good reason to infuse my dish with Bragg's Liquid Amino which is healthier than other seasonings. 
My only complaint is the edename in the vegetarian dish. Why do they have to include the shell? I don't like unwrapping them with my teeth!  ;-P

{"text":"The food was not oily which is good. However, it lacks taste. To make matter worse, it was extremely salty. The decor was light and the place was clean. None of the above matters if the food is not good. I will not go back again."}
{"text":"Great food and not too expensive. The chicken chow mein is always tasty and served hot. The employees are friendly and attentive and the restaurant itself is always squeaky clean."}
{"text":"Unconscionable that any establishment can't afford an actual outgoing message on their phone line.  I had to walk 10 blocks in the broiling AZ sun to find out from a hand-written note taped to the door that they were running shorter hours and not serving dinner now.  
Can't call ahead and ask, because nobody is there.  
Food might be top notch, but when they're running random hours and can't be bothered to update their info on Yelp, they deserve no stars.  Unfortunately I have to give them one star because otherwise I can't put this warning out there.  DO NOT GO WITHOUT CALLING FIRST, and if you don't talk to a human, DON'T WASTE ANOTHER SECOND but move on to another place that knows how to run a business."}
{"text":"this place is slappin. twice i have been in desperate need of some cream cheese wontons and twice these guys came through in the clutch

same homie was working the register both times i was there. we have only exchanged like 12 total words but honestly, i consider him one of my best friends. like ernest hemingway, this guy is very economical with his words but what we uses cuts straight to your heart when he says things like \"your order is ready\"

always quick. always place is clean. always cool decor. always bomb boba.

have gotten the sweet and sour pork and the sesame chicken. recommend the sesame over the s&s but i am splitting hairs here both are great

correct me if i am wrong, but there seems to be no General Tso's chicken on the menu, which is mildly devastating

regardless, #imwithhsin"}
{"text":"Good presentation but my chicken was clearly not fresh when I ate it. Idk if maybe they have a lot of food pre made so they can keep up with the college kid rush or what."}
{"text":"Just don't do it. The food is somewhat acceptable but definitely not in line with its price.
The boba is just syrup. I wouldn't consider it as boba. You can get better drinks from almost anywhere else. Take it from an Asian and do yourself a favor, find a different place."}
{"text":"Used all my m and g dollars here last semester.  Very convenient. Fast good quality service, seems to be family owned. They are very cooperative always give me extra rice instead of the veggies. Best menu items are the same chicken and orange chicken. If u live in taylor place great alternative to dining hall food."}
{"text":"Pretty good place to grab a quick bite if your near the area. Im a fan of the orange chicken meal!"}
{"text":"Not worth the money. I paid $7.85 for a small portion of clearly frozen, pre made curry. The chicken was rubbery, everything was clearly microwaved. Will not visit again."}
{"text":"The food is adequate, and the location is great for any ASU law students looking to fulfill a craving for Chinese takeout. The service is friendly, the food is made fast, and it's never too crowded during lunch hour like Chick-fil-a or nearby cafes. Most meals are $10 or less, and they probably sell the cheapest bottled water in the area at $1.09. The premises is clean, and conveniently located near the light rail/center bus station. Otherwise, it's pretty unremarkable. 

On a side note, they openly advertise that they will give anyone who writes a good Yelp review 20% off their order, so I wouldn't trust most of Hsin's five stars reviews."}
{"text":"two stars in my book is below average, not horrible, but not good, and that's what I feel Hsin Cafe is. 

In this location, you'd expect an inexpensive, large portion, take out style restaurant like Panda Express or the many copycat versions of it. Unfortunately for me, and for the students in the area, that's not what Hsin is. Instead, you'll find a very unpretentious but squeaky clean neighborhood restaurant with a somewhat limited menu of Chinese favorites, served with a \"healthy\" style. 

The man who was running the dining room during my visit was very friendly but didn't seem to understand what I wanted, or perhaps just didn't want to budge. I really was in the mood for Orange Chicken with some noodles, but in their meals they serve white rice, veggies, and main dish. It's $6.99 for the meal which isn't outrageous at all, but I just wasn't feeling steamed veggies. I asked if I could swap the veggies and rice for a small portion of noodles, and he tried to sell me veggie chow mein for an additional $2 which would have made my meal $9, now it's sounding very expensive. The recommendation then was to buy a la carte Orange Chicken, at $5.99, and add veggie chow mein to it, at $4... That's $10 as well. Why not add some flexibility to the menu for people who want something different? Most places will give you a choice of this or that, but Hsin seems to have the attitude that this is what we have, eat it or leave. When I got home, I thought the hot and sour soup I ordered was completely average, albeit a very small portion especially for $2. My orange chicken came in a decent sized order, but tasted like someone dumped a bottle of sesame oil in the batch. If I want to suck on a bottle of sesame oil, I'll go home and stick a nipple on the bottle in my pantry. 

The saving grace for this place is definitely its cleanliness, but the flexibility on the menu, the relatively high prices compared to the portion sizes, and the taste of the food is really all lackluster. You can be as \"nice\" as you want, and you can get away with mediocre food if you're really amazing with customer service, but Hsin is doing it wrong."}
{"text":"Food was fresh and good. Simple portion. Restaurant was small and very clean. Good bang for the buck."}
{"text":"the egg rolls have been fried fresh every time I've been here. Ordered the sesame chicken w fried rice.  Came with a big portion- about 9 pieces of chicken and a generous serving of rice.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"SO excited to have a decent chinese place in downtown that is actually open after 5!  As much as I love China Chili, I just can't drive up there all the time.  Having Hsin around is going to improve my culinary options.

We went during their grand opening.  I ordered the orange chicken and it was very good.  Some of the best orange chicken I have had, actually.  It was a bit weird though since it was accompanied by a fruit salad and cucumber slices.  Very odd choice of a side.  I liked getting fruit but some of it got the orange sauce on it and wasn't very good.  Oh well.

The people who worked there (especially the younger girl) were awesome.  Lots of personality and very helpful.  This place will quickly become a take-out favorite of ours."}
{"text":"I have been craving Asian food for a while now, especially Chinese, but with nothing terribly close (i.e. walking distance) until now, I wasn't too inspired to drive to find a place. I have been walking past Hsin for months now. After getting a copy of the menu in the clubhouse of my apartment complex and reading the reviews here, I knew it was time to stop in. 

When trying a new place I like getting several items off the menu to try. Thank goodness I enjoy leftovers! 
On this visit I got the fried dumplings, the original chow mein, the orange chicken meal and a bowl of hot and sour soup...to go. 
The soup...when first opened I loved the look, several fresh slices of mushroom, carrot, seaweed, onions, tofu...the flavor...there was something about it I was not too fond of, can't pin point what it was, kind of a rancidy undertone but I added some Siracha chile sauce, which covered up that flavor and finished the soup. 
The dumplings were deep fried potstickers (chicken filling) served with a ginger-garlic-soy dipping sauce that I really enjoyed (6 come to an order I had 2). 
The chow mein had plenty of fresh veggies, I added a little soy and Siracha to add some flavor, I am having the rest for lunch today. 
The orange chicken meal came with a good portion of chicken, white rice, fresh steamed broccoli and fresh fruit (apple, kiwi, grapes, strawberry). The orange chicken, its not the Panda Express orange chicken and while not as orange flavored as I like, it was very good, the rice perfectly steamed and chopstick friendly. The broccoli well steamed and still crisp, kudos! What I really liked was the fresh fruit. They did make an effort within the carry out container to separate the fruit from the meat/sauce with the rice and broccoli as buffers, but a little got through, definitely not a deal breaker for me.
I had a couple of pieces of chicken with rice and broccoli and finished the fruit in this sitting, the rest is waiting at home for me for dinner. 

Clean restaurant, friendly and quick service plus essentially I got 3 meals out of my order, and was all under $20. This is my kind of fast food."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. The service was poor and the food tasted even worse. I ate the white rice and that was it. Dumped the rest....save your 8 bucks and walk to the Irish Pub down the street!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Food is always fresh and everyone is very nice. Ben is a great cashier, so nice and friendly and usually there! Delicious yet typical Chinese food takeout restaurant. I would highly recommend this place if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"This place sucks. It's super expensive for the amount of food you get. Such little proportions. Orange chicken tasted like they just heated it up in the microwave with crappy steamed vegetables. The only positive thing I have to say about this place is that they're fast and they have good boba tea. But I still won't be coming back considering the unfair price for a school lunch sized proportion."}
{"text":"The owners of this fast-casual Asian diner on ASU's Downtown campus, brothers Jack and Ben Juang, put heart and soul into every family inspired creation and their passion comes through in every forkful (I only use chopsticks if I'm on a date or trying to eat slowly). 

I've been a huge fan since Hsin Cafe first opened its doors in the spring and will continue to champion their stellar menu, which includes fantastic chow mein, fried rice, curry and teryaki bowls, as well as signature entrees that showcase BBQ pork, beef, shrimp and chicken.

My current favorite is beef chow mein but I can honestly say that I've tried everything on the Hsin Cafe menu and not once have Ben and Jack disappointed. 

The portions are large so it's entirely possible that you're spending $5-7 on two meals--perfect for students or any workaday Downtowner on a budget."}
{"text":"It's really nice to have a decent Chinese food option Downtown at normal dinner hours.  We came during their grand opening and got like, half priced food, and then we have been another time for take out in the park.  

Both times I have been pleased with my food.  The first time I got mushroom chicken, or something like that, and it was very good.  The sauce was thick but not gross and gelatinous, and quite savoury.  There were tons of mushrooms and plenty of chicken to go around.  I wasn't quite sure what was going on with the apples and strawberries on my plate, but I ate them anyway.  I also got an egg roll.  They are fantastic!  I really do love them, and their sweet and sour sauce they serve with it is also great.  The second time, I got the Beef Fried Rice.  It was really nice and not greasy at all.  There were lots of veggies in it, but I could have done with a little bit more meat and a little less onion.  Overall though, it was great.

I really do love this place.  It's quick and convenient, and the staff is super friendly.  My only complaint is that they have Pepsi products, and everyone knows that Pepsi is gross.  I also found it hilarious that on their grand opening day they were giving out plastic Coke \"glasses\".  Ironic.  Great place, you should go!"}
