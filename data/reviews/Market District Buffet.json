{"text":"Warning!!!!...went to buffet for lunch on Thursday Mar 8 2018...normally I get excellent service..but...on this particular day and I guess I pissed someone off.  I ordered coffee and water...when I get back to my seat I notice a wad of spit in my coffee...did not drink just moved it aside...probably a isolated incident...and I'm pretty sure I know who did it...just check your drink."}
{"text":"If I could I would have broken up my star rating like this: 
(3) Stars for the food, which use to be a 4.5 but has gone down hear steadily this year.
(-5) for service, which honestly, was never anything to write home about, but has now gotten so bad that I have to say that I will not be back to eat here again.
There is simply no plan as to how to handle customers waiting in line to get into eat here. We stood in line for almost a half an hour with about four people in front of us. Here's how that was allowed to happen (which by the way, we later found out the one of only two cashiers was the manager).
First, they have this system whereby anyone with a higher spend Jack's membership card gets preference to us low life regular Jack card members. And I can understand this TO A POINT. Maybe have the one cashier ONLY for the higher spend card holders and NOT ALL the cashiers (which when they only have two cashiers is a real problem). It's so frustrating to be standing in line for so long and then see 5 or 6 people walk up to the Higher Spend Card line and simply walk right up to the cashiers and go in to eat ahead of us low life card holders who have been waiting for so long.
Secondly, a woman stood in line, letting one other person behind pass her UNTIL her other 7 friends showed up and then they all went up to the cashier, which took a good 15 minutes to process all seven because they said they were separate and NOT a group. I couldn't take it any more and voiced my problem about this, along with two other people in line behind me and the cashier (this was the manager it turns out) simply said, what can we do, we're doing our best. NO, YOU'RE NOT DOING YOUR BEST!!!. Not when you treat some customers like they are a complete inconvenience while treating others like they are something special. BTW, these total of 8 women were NOT in the High Spend Card line.
Even if the food was still good here, I don't think I'd be back with the attitudes the cashiers have with the waiting time and treatment of people in line, and believe me, this is NOT the entire staff because we had a wonderful waitress who not only took great care of us, but she made us feel welcomed, the complete opposite of the cashiers.
Real shame because I use to really enjoy stopping down to this place."}
{"text":"this used to be called \"the spread\" and is inside the jack casino. this buffet varies in quality and selection every day.  the two biggest problems are too much salt and lots of greasy entrees.  their soups are the worst because of the  2 qualities i just mentioned.  they are also obsessed with pork dishes. over 50% of the population does not eat pork because of religious and health reasons.  on any day 1/3- 2/3 of entrees feature pork.  i have complained about salt, grease, and pork to management, but iT has fallen on deaf ears. the have the worst corned beef in town- tough and salty. the prime rib is full of fat. the pluses are many- best smoked turkey i've ever eaten; 20 flavors of low-fat gelato. lots of fresh/cooked veggies and fruits incl. berries, pineapple, cantaloupe,and honeydew; terrific cheesecake. the chinese section is great and is run by a professional who used to own several chinese restaurants. the do have fresh fish on occasion, such as salmon and cod. the prices with a jacks card makes this a good value .all the staff incl. cooks and wait staff are very friendly and accommodating.  if you like or don't like something, please share with management. if they follow our suggestions, one day they will be 4* or 5*. i recommend you take rta also- a a 5 minute walk from buffet.  parking is expensive unless you gamble for at least 30 or 60 minutes."}
