{"text":"Bien caché il fallait le trouvé!
Un resto-bar-grill qui propose des burgers de bison, de wapiti et bien d'autres encore, des choix de plats différents, locaux ou exotiques, avec viande ou sans viande, des assiettes bien remplies et de délicieuses frites, un péché! Le dimanche c'est brunch à volonté mais pas encore essayé 
La première fois, repas du soir, très bonnes assiettes bien réalisées servies chaudes, bonne cuisson, bien assaisonné, rien à dire. La seconde fois, repas du midi, un peu moins de satisfaction quant à mon steak brûlé dans mon burger, pas le temps de la renvoyer, ça va pour cette fois mais grande déception tout de même :(
Les autres convives à la table étaient tous contents de leurs choix.
On donne une chance supplémentaire."}
{"text":"I love this place--the food is hardly haute cuisine but it is an awesome neighbourhood haunt with satisfying comfort food. It is super friendly, and their buffalo chicken burger--which is exactly what it sounds like, a burger consisting of breaded chicken, blue cheese and hot sauce--is like, the pinnacle of junk food to me. Their duck burger is also awesome, and they have a lovely quiet terrasse. This is a neighbourhood institution."}
{"text":"fun little kitschy spot located in the village. the decor is funky and fun and the folks eating all seemed laid back. the menu is super big - a little bit if this and a little but of that. that usually scares me so I stick to the basics. had a burger with fries( ok well I asked them to make it into poutine...) burger was perfectly charred felt like I was at a backyard BBQ. one thing I didn't like was the honey mustard sauce on it which I wasn't expecting it. other then that though- backyard BBQ. and poutine tasty too although it was only my second time ever having it so don't consider myself a good judge. our waitress was attentive and friendly and I recommend this chill spot if in the hood."}
{"text":"Nous y sommes allés à cinq l'été dernier pour un anniversaire. Comme il faisait beau, nous étions assis sur la terrasse en arrière du resto. Chacun avait prit un plat différent et tout était bon. Je me souviens avoir été impressionné par les choix de la table d'hôte affiché sur un tableau (près de vingt plats aussi originaux les uns que les autres)."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. First off, Coo Rouge has a great atmosphere. The interior is warm and inviting (slightly kitschy and eclectic decor but in a good way) and they have a beautiful terrace in the back. Second off, I live a block away. So I'd be going all the time if the place was halfway decent. But it's not. It's one of the worst restaurants I've been to in Montreal.

The menu is a mess of all things considered. The place does too much of everything (from fake cajun to tex-mex, from fish dishes to comfort food, from steak-frites to hamburgers, not to mention wraps, salads, pasta and poutine) but everything is equally bad. They need to radically revamp the menu, simplify, and concentrate on a few things and do them well. Because what they do serve is vile and almost inedible. I reserved judgment until the second time I ate there. The first time I had a mediocre hamburger. The second time I had one of the worst meals I've ever had in Montreal. The chicken in my wrap were hard nugget-like chunks that seemed to have been microwaved after languishing cooked in a freezer for the past month. The salsa tasted straight out of a jar and the guacamole had a powder like consistency. I don't think there's anything fresh there. Walking from the terrace to pay at the cashier, I had a peak in the kitchen and saw frozen packaged fries lying on the counter (the kitchen, on a whole, looked rather messy, if not outright disgusting). The place has potential but I have never encountered a restaurant in Montreal more deserving of a visit from Gordon Ramsay."}
{"text":"New address 1652 Ontario near the corner of Papineau. 

Best fries in Montreal in my opinion. Menu has lighter dishes such as sandwiches, salads, etc but also a Table d'Hote that has steaks, sea food, and duck.  

Personally I have had a wide variety of meals and have liked them all.  I love his duck meal.

Items are all made by the owner/chef personally.  

It is worth a trip."}
{"text":"We had a late, light dinner here tonight.  It was recommended by our B&B host and is an easy block and a half walk.  The building is old and the décor is charming and eclectic.  The room you enter has the bar and it's noisier than the room to the left.  We were greeted warmly and given our choice of tables.  We chose the quieter room.  Tables are covered w/ butcher paper.  There's a bilingual menu and the table d'hôte is on a blackboard.  Many things looked good, but we weren't hungry enough for anything major.  

Alan chose the smoked salmon entrée (entrée here is an appetizer at home).  Our hostess was concerned that it wouldn't be enough for him.  I chose a four cheese sandwich w/ tomato and pesto.  It was heated but not grilled as a panini is.  It came w/ a choice of fries or salad and I chose the latter.  Both salad and sandwich were tasty.  Alan was pleased w/ his salmon.  He had bites of the salad and of the sandwich, so we both had enough food because I wasn't as hungry as he was.  We both had water to drink.  Service was friendly and accommodating and the food hit the spot.  3.51, rounded up."}
