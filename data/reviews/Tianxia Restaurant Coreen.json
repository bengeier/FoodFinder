{"text":"Great concept, came here as a group of 4 and loved the experience! Owner is super nice, place is quiet and neat, the meat was really good. Plus pistachio ice cream as dessert! The only inconvenience are that their tables are a tad small to hold all the little bowls and platters."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday. Lunch all you can eat BBQ is only 16 dollars, the meat is very good. Also you can drink as much coke or sprite as you want.  Not much meat choices for lunch tho."}
{"text":"I went there the other day and i was pleased.  Like mentionned before, the formula is simple.  All you can eat.  Take a sheet and check what you want, give the sheet, repeat!  The meat is not grade A, but it's ok.  Next time, i'll probably only focus on ribs and beef.

The service is ok and the staff is nice.

Free soft drinks"}
{"text":"tianxia is a nice quiet place... not loud like seoul chako...the portions were pretty big comparred to chako... we almost orderred too much... food is good... service is good...not over crowded for 7pm on a friday night.  some of the meat is not marinated. 
i would go back because its cheaper and quiet, no need to yell for a conversation."}
{"text":"Really bad experience, don't waste your money here. Chinese folks serving bad Korean food. We were served a small rock-hard pajeon (savory pancake) that looked out of a box, it was so bad that none of us ate any after one bite. We sent it back but were still charged for it. The rest of our meal was just as disappointing, as it was for the only 2 other customers in the restaurant at peak hour. All the negative reviews are true and we suspect most of the five stars are fake."}
{"text":"Another really good place to have Korean BBQ that offers a different experience in MTL. I love the whole concept of barbecuing your own food and I've been to different ones in MTL and I can say that I wasn't disappointed by thus place!"}
{"text":"After eating  at 2 korean restaurants (  an all you can eat Seoul Chakos among other ), i went to Tianxia and i was pleased.

Not only this restaurant is cheaper ( 22 $ with a soft  drink ) than Seoul Chakos the meats are better and the small portions are best for me as you can taste lots of things. 

Good meat variety (Ox, chicken, lamb), and a few sea foods (shrimp and salmon) are available.

Like all the Korean all you can eat you cooked your meat directly on your table.

Just make sure you're really hungry before you went to this restaurant and you'll be pleasantly pleased.

As for a korean all you can eat restaurant  this is perfect for me ! And it's in downtown Montréal  ! 

For a more sophisticated decoration and food (for a date) i'll suggest you went to Atti on university street. But among friend it's the best korean restaurant around !

Français : Après avoir manger dans 2 restaurant Coréen (dont un all you can eat le Seoul Chakos). J'ai été agréablement surpris au restaurant Tianxia, les viandes sont plus tendres et le prix est abordable 22$ avec une boisson gazeuse. 

Les petites portions nous permettent de gouter plusieurs variétés de viandes (poulet, boeuf, agneau ) et quelques fruits de mer (crevette, saumon) sont offert au menu.

Comme tous les (tous ce que vous pouvez manger) vous cuisez sur votre table les viandes que vous apporte la serveuse. 

Assurer-vous d'avoir faim avant d'aller à ce restaurant et j'en suis persuadé vous serez agréablement surpris  !

Le décor est simple mais de bon goût, et le personnel est courtois !

Le meilleur buffet coréen à Montréal selon moi ! Et en plus situé au centre-ville de Montréal!

Pour un décor plus agréable et un menu plus sophistiqué (pour une date par exemple) je vous suggère le restaurant ATTI sur university .

 Mais pour une bouffe entre amis Tianxi  est parfait !"}
{"text":"Honestly, you might have been frustrated at Korean BBQ portions in regular places and perhaps even more when you had to pay $30 for it. Well, here comes Kanda's alter ego (which probably caught some of its market share given that the sushi place is aiming for BBQ as well): same formula, same result.

Indeed, you will find a selection of eight meats (ox tongue, marinated chicken lamb ALL YOU CAN EAT) and  many side dishes that are good enough to fill your glutony. Sashimis, Korean kimchi pizza (well, some sort of pajeon), raw beef and the cutest of all: Mini-Bibimpap. And that's what specifically smart about this place as actual side dishes are served in small portions and not bowls like Tokyo Sushi would do. 

Hungry for a lot of Korean food? Go for it. $25 after tax, with a soft drink included."}
{"text":"Went there on Saturday for late lunch after visiting the Museum of Art on Sherbrooke. The food was okay, but the place itself and the service were not. 

The Chinese waitress barely spoke French and English, so that created a little problem from the start.

The place  BADLY NEEDS a ventilation system, which is a must for a restaurant with mini grills on each table! There was a ventilator in the back which was blowing the smoke from all the tables toward the windows and the door. We came out of this place stinking off burn Chinese food. Had to go back to hotel, take a shower and change. 

As we got up to go to the counter and pay, a man and a woman (supposedly the family working in the restaurant) walked out from the kitchen and set down to eat at the first table next to clients!!! The only waitress/cashier joined them immediately!

When we got to the counter, we looked back at her, and she got up and run the credit card through, only to run back stick her face in a bowl of rice while the card was being processed. It really took 5 seconds or so, and here she runs back to check the printout. Unfortunately, the card did not go through, so she ran it again, and stormed back to the table to continue eating.

That was really a cartoonish experience )))) 

This is not a place I would recommend to my friends, and I will not go there again on my next trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"This is an okay Korean place. It has the Korean grill option and an a-la-carte menu. The place has a very strong smell from the grilling so your clothes will start to stink!"}
{"text":"Great all you can eat buffet. You're given the buffet menu,choose the items you want,then sit back,get served and enjoy the delicious fare. The service is very prompt and attentive,but serving utensils would be a good idea when someone has to man the grill, larger dishes for the various sauces would be greatly appreciated as well.Overall, great food,very good service and reasonsbly priced."}
{"text":"Ne pas y aller....sous aucun prétexte!!! 
Je vous conseille le McDo 2 coins de rues plus bas!
Pourquoi? 
Simplement car j'ai été malade....vraiment très malade! 
J'y suis allée avec mon copain qui a eu un mal de ventre épouvantable pendant 24h. 
Nous n'avons même pas terminé nos commandes que nous sommes allés payer pour prendre les jambes à notre cou. 
Le service rapide. 
Les toilettes...dégueulasses, même pire que dans certains pays...
La nourriture...tout ce qui a de plus ordinaire et pauvre en goût.
Les soupes...tièdes et salées à souhait..."}
{"text":"Compare to Seoul Chako, the freshness of the meat is better here although there are not many types of selections. Would recommend to order octopus, lamb, white fish, and streaky pork. There are free soft drinks as well."}
{"text":"The bibimbap here is good, better than Ganadara. Good portion, the beef wasn't ground as usual, but still good, and I liked the sauce. Only negative was the rice was too wet. It was crowded and most people ordered Korean bbq ($21.99 all you can eat) so we'll definitely be back for that."}
{"text":"Definitely a must visit for AYCE Korean BBQ in Montreal. Tianxia has better quality and more variety of meat than other places like Seoul Chako. For example, I find that Seoul Chako sometimes over-marinate their meat. Tianxia also offers free soft drinks in its AYCE price. My only criticism is that the place is a bit small so it can't accommodate large groups, and for a fun activity like Korean BBQ (where you cook the meat yourself), you want to go in large groups."}
{"text":"Not good at all. Its not an authentic Korean bbq. Its a Korean bbq place but it was owned by a Chinese. They give only two side dish, seaweed salad and kimchi. Although they give large portions of beefs unlimited soda which is good. Only one dessert in the menu which is ice cream (blueberry and green tea only)."}
{"text":"I have been here three times. This is not really a Korean type. Fare to say it's Asian BBQ. For lunch, the choices of meat are only 4 plus fish. I like beef rib and fish fillet the best. They offer many other dishes like fires and fried rice. I always have pork potato soup and Korean cold noodle. The quality of meat is average but worth the money 15.99$. Plus 10% off for students. 
The place is always half empty. This time with road construction right outside and wide open door, the noise level is very high.  
The service was unsatisfactory. I came late at 2 pm. The only waitress already sat in the restaurant and have her big lunch with three other tables dinning and other people coming in. I understand you open at 11 am and you need to have lunch. A quick bite is understandable, sitting among customers, and keep eating for one hour is not very convenient to me. I had to stand up and approach to her to add orders and remind her of our orders, and I felt bad to interrupt her great lunch. 
At last the waitress charged us with tips included bill. Hate to say this but it's typical in cheap Chinese restaurants. Like I couldn't do the math or you are confident your service wouldn't get any appreciation."}
{"text":"Yesterday i came to this place with friends. They switched their buffet kbbq to Chinese \"Chuan Chuan Xiang\". Its basically just put vegetables or meats on stick and pour sauce on it. 


They'll give to you a menu so you can choose how many you want. 

BUT, shit it's not cheap, a dollar for a piece of lettuce, a dollar for a iceberg lettuce, etc. And 1,50$ for meats, if you want to eat full for one person,  I would say that you have to spend at least 30$ - 40$. Compare to hotpot buffet, you spend no more then 30$ and you can get as much as you want for same stuffs.

The taste was so-so, we went there because they had discount for the moment. 

Plus, they made an error with our order, few items were missing. If you don't pay attention, you won't notice."}
{"text":"Come here on an empty stomach! The amount of food is pretty hefty! Sure, you cook on the grill yourself, but there is a wide selection of (fresh) meats, and other food. It's a 'buffet', but chances are, you'll be full rather quickly (and it's pretty delicious!). The staff is friendly and very accommodating, though the gentleman was surprised that we couldn't eat more. We even brought a friend the second time to help us out (lol). Lunch seems to be more economical (cheaper and still a buffet)."}
{"text":"Really good food and service, cheap price. Highly recommended BBQ. Unlimited soft drink."}
{"text":"Completely underwhelmed by the food here.  The meat is not marinated and lacks flavour.  Do not come here expecting to find true Korean BBQ.  

The food comes with sides of spices and sauces to put on the meat while it cooks but there is definitely a lack of quality to the meat that is served.  This place is passable considering how cheap it is."}
