{"text":"There are lazy days where I don't want to cook but that's okay because there's Tipps Cafe! I work a few buildings down and will usually stop by to grab lunch. The veggie sandwich is my go-to and I'm not even vegetarian! I have yet to explore the menu. The food is great and so is the service. They are very welcoming and will go above and beyond to satisfy your tummy. And it's a good spot to just hangout and have some peace of mind."}
{"text":"Such a great hidden gem!! The breakfast sandwiches are addictively good. Quaint atmosphere, good prices, and incredibly sweet service. If you're looking for a great little out of the way place to be your go to, this is the spot"}
{"text":"Very friendly server. Clean and welcoming. Great french toast breakfast for hubby and veggie sandwich lunch for me. Husband loving watching football on big screen tv.  We'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Thai iced tea was delicious! Had the traditional breakfast and the staff was very nice and helpful. Very calm and comfortable coffee shop environment with nice table and bar seating."}
{"text":"Great food and very willing to accommodate request. I am gluten free and was happy with my meal."}
{"text":"Visiting from San Diego and decided to try this place out. It is super cute and the food is great! We tried the bacon croissant sandwich and an omelette -both were great. Food was fresh and the coffee was perfect!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service and great food. The menu is a bit limited, but the omelets are superb. The staff were extremely friendly helpful and professional."}
{"text":"Awesome coffee and breakfast/lunch place! Really cute and friendly atmosphere.. it's a must try!!"}
{"text":"I love going here before or after Trufusion... (boh) the cashier is super nice! She always make sure your like your order... I always grab fruit shakes here form strawberry banana to mango shake. Also tried the bacon sandwich which is really good the prices are decent. The place also have a lot of coffee to choose from.. haven't tried the coffee yet! Place is clean and the people are really nice!"}
{"text":"This quiet little neighborhood cafe has become a favorite spot for me to stop when in the area with time to kill. The location is small but nicely decorated with several 4 tops, I've never seen it too crowded but this isn't really a place for groups. They have good breakfast and lunch specials like omelets, salads, and sandwiches. I usually just pop in for a drink and their WiFi (pw: Tippsconnect), and I appreciate that they don't rush me out of there. Right now, the weather is perfect for sipping on a hot latte on their patio!"}
{"text":"Amazing service from start to finish! Super cute decor inside and the food is great. I would highly suggest coming here. My friend and I stopped here for lunch and it was the perfect spot. They're very quick, and they even have WiFi."}
{"text":"I have been to this small cafe more than a few times now, and everything I have ordered was A-1 tip-top good food, from the breakfasts to the sandwiches. Friendly customer service every time I go in."}
{"text":"Tipps Cafe is my go to place for lunch. It's near my work and very convenient. Their service is quick and their food is delicious! I've come here so often that I've gotten to know the owner. She is very kind and always recommending new things to me. So personable! I love their food because it's so simple yet so filling. 

A couple of my favorites are the spicy tuna sandwich and the arugula salad (with chicken). Yummm!"}
{"text":"I love the iced cafe mocha here because their beans are rich/oily and they don't use that heavy sweet flavor syrup. So you really taste the coffee. So hard to find when drinking iced coffee. And it's been consistent so far (4 times now) which is so important when finding a go to coffee spot! 
Owners are always nice and helpful. 
Location is great with lots of parking! 
It hasn't been busy the few times that I've gone- which is what I like:) It's just a very cute comfy quiet, soup/sandwich and coffee spot.
But we need to support small businesses so hopefully more people start making this their new coffee spot!"}
{"text":"I found this cute little place on Yelp because it had great reviews so decided to visit it for lunch. Very cute cafe with deliciousness food made from fresh ingredients. The staff was very friendly and accommodating even though we came in 30 min before closing. There's even an area to sit and eat outside. Definitely going to come back and try the breakfasts items."}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I were looking for an inexpensive quick place to eat on our day out. We saw Tipps on Yelp & thought we'd try it out. As soon as we walked in the owner was very nice & offered us menus & gave us time to look at what we wanted. The food is delicious, they have quick and friendly service, & we will be coming back here with our friends soon."}
{"text":"Such an amazing small cafe feel! The customer service is amazing. Treated with such hospitality! They truly go above & beyond. Great breakfast, sandwiches & soups. We had their mango smoothie which is freshly made, dairy free & super tasty. Great patio seating too!"}
{"text":"Food and service was excellent. It's a quaint little coffee shop with nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Drove from South of the strip because of the tell reviews.     It was worth it.  The cafe is pretty simple.  (Not a huge menu) but the coffee is excellent. We had a croissant sandwich with egg, cheddar and bacon.   Very yummy.   
Customer service is excellent.  Very friendly.  
Nice setting with outdoor tables.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time today and had their omelettes. Their food, coffee, and especially the service was excellent for a cheap price. The owners were very welcoming and attentive. Highly recommend and I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I know it's a restaurant/ cafe like I said I would've been willing to purchase something but the tone made me want to leave. It made me uncomfortable, and it could've been handled differently and POLITELY. Thanks fo responding."}
{"text":"So I was doing some training on the other side of town. I was looking for nice light lunch for recovery meal. I was searching for stuff around the area. I notice Tipps Cafe. So figure why not give it try.  

My first impression when walk in was interior has lasting impact in five star way. The outside thinking about more like industrial area vibe shopping center cause not lot of food spots in it. The minute you walk in the door feel the owners put lot of work or the details came to making you feel relax dine in atmosphere. They have fire place not sure if real working one or not. Basically like one see in real house chilling in the living room. On one wall you see all these phrases on different plaques spread across. I like that personality very much! Each one very different. The napkins holders got personality. This tiny coffee cup that holds the napkins down. They have outdoor patio area. Just great atmosphere chill over book with good cup of coffee.

I ordered a Bagel Sandwich with turkey, swiss and added fried egg (extra charge). The Bagel itself was good not going rave about it cause not fresh. Deli slice of turkey tasted very much fresh, tasty, and get decent portion. Fried egg. Nothing better in any sandwich or for me then fried egg. You get some of that egg yolk action all over. lol! The FRESH fruit comes with the sandwich. Something that five star shout out. Nine times out of ten for my experience. Side of fruit or get sliced of fruit with dish. Never look FRESH more less taste it. Tipps Cafe it was on point. Strawberry, blueberry, and orange slices. 

The menu have nice diversity also salads besides sandwiches. They also have whole section for smoothies. I need try some of those next visit. They have a stamp card program that covers both drinks and sandwiches. Buy 10 get one free.

My drink ordered Caramel Macchiato Frappucino. Delicious! It was not over sweet just right. It had nice balance.

If your in the area should check it out!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"First time here. I came in with my family and the first impression is that it is a clean place, which is a great thing. The breakfast menu is small but it has a variety which is good for guests who want to eat the classic American egg/sandwich or French toast with savory smoothies. We also had drinks (Lattes, strawberry/banana smoothies and they were tasty). And the best part is that it looks like a family business since a little boy was our food runner/busser. We hope to come back soon."}
{"text":"Used to be Globe Cafe but let me tell you this place is really out of this world. For a cafe that serves coffee man Starbucks better watch out! Not only is there coffee great! But there food is even better, if your looking for a nice great breakfast or lunch spot on your way to work or over your days off weekend I suggest trying Tipps Cafe! Worth the try!!"}
{"text":"Awesome lil gem that I'd had over looked with out Yelp so .. ya know..  nice job Yelp.   Had a fever and the only cure was a croissant. Preferably a breakfast croissant sandwich.  Tipps Cafe provided the cure.  
Bacon, provolone, egg croissant. Here's why the 5 star.  The egg. 
I'm a total egg snob. I like'em the way I like'em and that's about it. And the way I like'em is what I call the 'jammy' yolk. I want that yolk firm on the edge and jammy molten middle. Not runny. Jammy. At this point I don't even bother trying to get them that way cause it never seems to pan out.  Low and behold the 'jammiest' of eggs come proudly in that buttery croissant, flanked by proper bacon, not that greasy stuff, and a warm loving blanket of provolone. Dear god. 
Super fresh fruit on the side and some legit coffee and Boom! Epic breakfast.  
Definitely will be back to tackle the Lunch menu!"}
{"text":"I cannot recommend this place enough. I ate there last week with my boyfriend and had an amazing breakfast with really great service, but forgot to write a review. Fast forward to today when I called to ask if I had left my keys there, and it turns out the owners had spent *DAYS* trying to track me down. The amount of work the wife went through to return my keys to me just exceeds any normal level of expectation as it concerns customer service. Just eat here. You'll love the food and love the people making it. 

THANK YOU TIPPS!!"}
{"text":"Cute little cafe with a huge patio! The coffee is amazing and their smoothies are delicious. Can't wait to bring our dog on a weekend and enjoy the good weather and great food!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this little cafe spot down the street from us.   My wife and I had breakfast/brunch here recently just to try something new and it actually exceeded our expectations. 

The inside is cute and filled with decor of Paris, with displays of the Eiffel Tower, while the brewing coffee's aroma pleasantly filled the room.  

The staff was welcoming, friendly, and always topped off my coffee.   

My wife had a plate of French toast and fruits which she enjoyed and finished all of it.  

I saw a sandwich special on the board and ordered that.  It was their take of a B.L.T. with a generous portion of avocado.  The sandwich came with a side of sweet potato chips and the entire meal was satisfying.  

With very reasonable prices and a great cup of coffee, definitely check out Tipps when you're in the area."}
{"text":"This is a cute little find! My boyfriend and I were looking for a quick bite and this place was perfect. The service was amazing and so was the food! Perfect portions for lunch and they had delicious smoothies."}
{"text":"A cute and comfy cafe with yummy foods! Ordered a lot of different foods, and everything was very delicious!"}
{"text":"Ok this is the best breakfast sandwich I've found in Las Vegas.  This is my first time at Tipps.  I found them on yelp and I'm very happy I did.   I can't wait to bring my friends here.  This place rocks!   The staff here are super friendly and attentive to your every need.  Bo was especially helpful and friendly. Made me feel at home.  Tipps has a family feel great food and very reasonable prices.  My friend had the breakfast and he couldn't stop raving about how good the potatos were.  I can't believe I haven't heard of this place before.  One of Vegas's best kept secrets and it's in my neighborhood.  They also have high speed internet and it looks a great place to work outside the office or study for college exams while enjoying their delicious menu.  I'll definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Amazing and very large breakfast sandwiches!!! My husband got a bagel, egg, bacon and cheddar sandwich and I got a egg, pastrami, swiss on a croissant! They come with fresh fruit and a fried egg. Delicious lattes, as well!! Great local spot! We can't wait to try lunch there, soon!"}
{"text":"Seen this place while driving on eastern. Ate breakfast. Ot was goos and very healthy."}
{"text":"The chef was so customer service oriented. It was a pleasure to talk to him. I order a croissant and it is a good size. Comes with fruit. It tastes yummy!"}
{"text":"I'm not one to write out negative reviews unless they're worthy. This is worthy.

I was driving down the street and curiosity struck. I pulled in and walked inside for the first time. The atmosphere brings on an illusion of comfort, for it closely resembles the lobby of a retirement home, and not a coffee shop.

Luckily, I planned on getting something on the go. And so I ordered a latte, which I believe has the best distribution of espresso and milk. (A coffee snob can argue about this at another time.)

I finally get my delicious latte... And it tasted AWFUL! Closely resembling soap. Oh but of course I forgot to add sugar, silly me!

Well, let me tell you, no amount of sugar, not even 10 of those little packets, could rectify this beverage. At this point, the latte tasted of soap sweetened with an excessive amount of sugar. To compare, a beverage at Starbucks would ultimately be liquid gold compared to this pile of junk!

The only conclusion that I can come up with is that the beans were stale, though actually, I'm not quite sure if that's a right assessment either. Stale coffee tastes better than the abomination I had!

TL;DR: If you want your caffieine high, go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"The best breakfast potatoes and eggs I've had! Visiting from San Diego we wanted something different that wasn't on the strip but still good quality food and Tipps Cafe with Chef Paul and his wife Bo certainly did not disappoint! We will absolutely be coming back to eat again."}
{"text":"Saw this place on yelp after leaving the airport and decided to check it out since it looked relatively inexpensive. Nice clean place that was bright and airy so that was definitely a plus after getting off the airplane. Friendly staff and the food was tasty too. It's also a nice place to sit down have a coffee and read if that's your thing. Nice and quiet 

I had the meat omelet and my friend had the veggie omelet and both were great!"}
{"text":"I came to Tipp's just to get what I assumed would be mediocre coffee. Instead, I was surprised to find the most hospitable caffe I've ever set foot in. The food was superb, and the friendly staff rushed to meet my every need before I even realized I needed something. It is a cultivated experience; elegant recessed lighting, cozy chairs, and homey decor. Perfect place for morning coffee or lunch. Seats up to four at a table and a nice bar if you're visiting solo. Make sure to try their Turkey Avocado bacon sandwich. It is just,"}
{"text":"This is a hidden sandwich gem. I'm almost afraid to jinx it for fear there will be lines next time I go! Family owned and ran. Awesome sandwiches, with the egg salad being my favorite. I asked them to add jalapeños and it was so delicious. They serve paninis, too. Limited seating. Small-ish menu. You won't be disappointed if you need to core your sandwich craving (as I often do)."}
{"text":"Came back to try something else on the menu and didn't disappoint!! Salad is really good and husband said the sandwich is bomb. Smoothie is so refreshing!!"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!!!
It is a hidden jewel for locals and visitors alike.  The food and service are superb, it has a wonderful atmosphere to relax and enjoy great quality food for breakfast and lunch.  Love this place, we'll be back..."}
{"text":"Although I live way on the northeastern side of Vegas, Tipps Cafe is well worth the trip to Henderson, I came across this small little cafe that offers sandwiches, coffees, smoothies and fantastic Thai Iced Tea (one of my favorite beverages). I got the club sandwich- it was delicious and generous portion - most places that offer sandwiches are on the thin side - but not at Tipps.  The cafe is clean and very comfortable, just like a place I would visit in the Midwest - down home hospitality.  There is indoor and outdoor seating. Television with a fireplace.  Did I say comfortable (setting) If you are looking to get a quick bite, morning, noon or night or even a daily cafe to sit and relax with your coffee- this would be my pick.  Excellent customer service where you feel more like a house guest - even family! Five stars- looking forward to my next visit ."}
{"text":"I am very glad that they are in the Same plaza as my appointment, bc I have a test to take and I needed something to eat before it. 
Delicious BLT & Caribbean Smoothy!!
Keep it up with the great work! 
Thank you!!"}
{"text":"A few things..
1. Having kids, and I mean like 8 and 10, being the face of your restaurant not smart. Walking in I had to ask if I sit or order at the counter...kid said whatever.. Ok I ordered, kid didn't write anything down..then the mom I guess came over and started writing stuff. I get your a family establishment..just make sure the kids are trained and know things.
2. Menu is so small. Like 6 items. Had a bagel sandwich. No choice of bagel. No choice how the egg is done..and if there was it wasent voiced or on the menu. Btw the sandwich was good but runny yoke on my egg..gross.
3. Portion sizes small. I got a side of potatoes with my sandwich and there were hardly any. And the side of fruit was one strawberry sliced, two half slices of orange and 2 half slices of apple...could you spare the fruit?
4. Place is small. 4 tables and some counter seating that's it..there are tables outside with no form of shade. Noon it was 95 degrees out. Don't want to sit out there.
5. Everything is disposable. Paper plates. Plastic silverware in take out packs, plastic cups. Go to IKEA and get some real dishes and real silverware.

The good tasted good but could use some bigger portions and some plating work.
The inside is cute but the spent all the money on fancy signs. 
If it was a good truck or cart I can see having disposable everything but its not.
Try it. You might like it but I most likely will not be back."}
{"text":"Have only been once so far but was incredibly impressed during that visit. Had a breakfast sandwich and my wife had what she described as \"the best smoothie she's ever had\". I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Tipps Cafe is a cozy spot for a lazy Sunday morn to have breakfast/brunch.  If you like quiet, nice ambience and good comfort food, this is your place."}
{"text":"My favorite thing about a restaurant is a simple menu, yet has everything you'd want. The food is affordable and delicious, and the chef and staff are wonderful. The ambience is especially cute.

We had the Strawberry Banana smoothie, Thai Iced Coffee, Veggie Omelette, and Waffles & Berries. Everything was fresh and delightful. 

Whether you're looking for a quick cup of coffee, or a place to sit and eat for breakfast- this is the perfect joint."}
{"text":"Loved my berry smoothie .. got club sandwich .. will go back . Came with choice of chips. Good light lunch"}
{"text":"Great customer service! I came here to get a quick breakfast before school and everything was delicious. The decorations and atmosphere are very relaxing so I was able to concentrate and get some stuff done as well."}
{"text":"Service so bad I give 1 star. I would give 0 stars if that was possible. I don't think the lady working around 12pm on a tues morning even knows anything about customer service. Let alone treat another with respect. Sigh.... Plus the coffee was just flat out disgusting."}
{"text":"We are from out of town and came in for breakfast. Everything we had was amazing and the service was fantastic. We wish we lived closer and could enjoy the food and atmosphere more often."}
{"text":"I had the coffee of the day, Jamaican, and it was as good as our server mentioned. The veggie omelet was hearty. Nice cozy inviting decor."}
{"text":"Great food! Fast service. Great flavors make it a treat!!  Highly recommend for a great breakfast or lunch. Pork loin sandwich is the bomb!!"}
{"text":"I needed me more caffeine prior to a night at work and figured I'd finally give this place a try since it's near my workplace. The owner was the one who greeted me and assisted me and I'm thankful for her dealing with my indecisiveness. Although it was a short and sweet visit, she made me feel valued by giving suggestions on what to order and making sure I liked the way my Caramel Macchiato was made. It did the job and helped me get through the night! So kudos for that.

The place was so clean, with cute Christmas decor. She suggested I'd come back to try their food items and I'm going to make that happen in the near future since everyone who did post food pics is making me salivate."}
{"text":"First two me here. Tasty food. Friendly staff. Fast and prompt service. Cozy decor I'll be back!"}
{"text":"First time here and immediately get the 'mom&pop' vibe. The staff definitely compliments this feeling. Ordered the spicy tuna sandwich. Sandwich came with a pickle and bag of chips. Delicious! The place was mostly empty at noon on a Friday but enjoyed the solitude. The location is surprisingly nice. It sits at an inside corner of an office complex and has a beautiful outside patio. I foresee coming here often to get work done in a peaceful and quiet manner :)"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and even better food! Quick and friendly service as well! Fresh fruit and french toast were yummy:)"}
{"text":"Very pleased with the whole experience. The breakfast menu consists of omelette, waffle, bagels and croissant sandwiches, all small portions so this is not a place to pig out and stuff yourself with huge plates of fried bacon and sausages. The lattes were really good and the server was very friendly and had lots of patience with all our questions and special requests."}
{"text":"Best place to eat in town. Customer service is impeccable. Bo treats you like family. The atmosphere is comforting and the food is GREAT! Tipps Cafe makes the best lattes. You must try this place!"}
{"text":"I love the food! The vibe is very positive. They treat you like family as soon as you walk in. The coffee is delicious!"}
