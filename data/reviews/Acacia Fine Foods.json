{"text":"Live very close to this place and I have never checked it out. Came here around 3pm and the place was completely dead. I thought this was my first flag. Ordered a half moon falafel sandwich and the wait was a tad bit long. But the bread was made fresh in their oven. I have to say though, the falafel sandwich was the best I've ever had (and I've tried them everywhere). I even ate the sandwich way later than when I bought it. I must try it here again fresh. The manakeesh looked intriguing as well as I order it at other places."}
{"text":"The manakeesh is delicious! I'd especially recommend the Buffalo Chicken Pizza and the Beef with Cheese. Great late-night assignment fuel ;)"}
{"text":"This was a rediculous venue for something to eat...empty fridges...place looks like a ware house...went in and right away went out...it didn't give any feel of a restaurant at all...ugly decor and lots of TV screens with ugly menu colors...will never step in again...there was on table only at the restaurant...very arrogant owner. .."}
{"text":"Authentic Lebanese food! The grills are just fantastic! No place...and I mean literally no place in GTA serves such an amazing Lebanese,sham food like Acacia. The juicy sausage(nakanek),the kebab, delicious starters and salads(tabouleh, fatoush,...) are just great. Love this place :)))"}
{"text":"Worst service i have ever seen . ordered sisha, requested for filter and we got dat after 30 min ."}
{"text":"The best middle eastern food in Mississauga. We eat there every week. Good service and clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Great server, fair price, good food. They messed up my order but, gave me free fries!  I would go back for sure."}
{"text":"Gr8 place, but getting bored of the same menus all Mediterranean restaurants have these days, I hope they add some good items to freshen it up."}
{"text":"Great location!  Overall good experience:  1) servers were great, helpful and pleasant. They brought hot fresh bread few times.   2) meat was good. Hummus was awesome.   Con: The meat was not warm. (Twice). Make sure you ask them about it.   Salads: fresh, clean and I was told that they have a special machine to wash vegetables. A+"}
{"text":"Seriously, nothing particularly tasty.  Food is bland, service very sparse and slow despite being a slow night overall.  Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"I'm going to try to be as fair as possible with this review.  The first time I went, I decided to dine in. My food took forever to come. The fattoush salad came with the dressing on the side. It was hardly enough and the salad came out very dry. But WORST of all, which was pretty unbelievable, was the way they cleared tables. One guy had a rolling garbage bin and emptied plates and left over foods into the bin. He rolled the bin between tables. The last thing you want while eating is to see a rolling stinky garbage bin rolling next to you. In every other restaurant in the world, the waiter takes your plates to the back.  In regards to the food, it is descent, nothing too special and not that bad. The chicken shawarma is a bit dry (ask for extra garlic sauce), the manakeesh are really good. The mixed girl plate is delicious and huge (also cheap).  In my opinion, they are trying too hard to be like Paramount Fine foods. The way you order and the style of food is exactly the same. Paramount is waaaaay better. If you live in the square one area, I guess Acacia can satisfy your need for middle eastern food but I would recommend you go the extra mile (literally and figuratively) and go to Paramount to eat the best Lebanese food in the GTA"}
{"text":"Like the food ,very authentic, hate the sitting area, seems large and  open in unusual way, waiting time is long for such 'almost empty' place."}
{"text":"~2.5 stars ~  Shout out to Sarah S. I read her review and went to get my Zatar fix. I did a take our and ordered their Zatar  Manakeesh and Beef & Cheese Manakeesh. Manakeesh is a flat bread with topping. I absolutely loved it, by far this was the best Zatar Bread I have had so far in Canada plus the Beef bread was full of Beef and Cheese.   I also ordered their Mixed Grill which come with 4 Skewers (1 chicken breast, 1 Bbq Beef, 2 Bbq Kafta). The meat was very well done! This here was over priced as the quantity was too low when compared to other vendors. The meat was sufficient but the rice and salad was very little and there was no bread either, when the menu did state spicy bread. The only reason I am pointing this out is that they are re-branding to a Beirut Bistro and have jacked up the prices, the mixed grill plate cost twice as the regular kabab meal. The owner did point out the increase but as they didn't have the menu changed, I didn't clue in. If I knew I would have order two other meals.   While rating the place I had mixed feelings.  Ambiance - 4/5 Food Taste - 4/5 Food Quantity - 2.5/5 (in comparison to similar vendors, go for Manakeesh instead of plates) Food Pricing -  2.5/5 Service - 3/5 (lucky the owner was there and he made sure that we understood the menu, as the server lady had no clue)  P.S. They serve Halal food."}
{"text":"4 stars for the food. The mixed grill served here is good. The falafels are always fresh tasting and perfect..reminds me of my time in the Middle East.  I went here on a Saturday night and there were not many people in the restaurant. The sheesha section beside the restaurant area was packed. 3 stars for the service. If you are looking for a place to eat middle eastern/lebanese in a quiet and not so crowded restaurant, give the big name Middle East restaurant chain a miss and head on over to Acacia. Also this place serves Halal meat."}
{"text":"First visit here last night for take out and it was great. Got the chicken shawrma and shish tawouk plates. The owner is really friendly, as was the cook and server.   The food was really tasty. The meat for the shawrma I noticed was partially breast meat which speaks to their quality. The pita bread that comes with the meal is ahhhhhmazing. I think its made fresh in their round oven. The garlic sauce is great too. The only part of the meal that could be improved on is the salad. Its just different items. Probably be better if everything was combined with a nice sauce.  They also have different baklava which was $25/kg. I got 0.3 kg which came to around $7 and got about 12 pieces.  Acacia is now going to be my go to place for shawrma cravings!!"}
{"text":"This place is okay...but they charge extra for the level of spice in your food and they don't even tell you beforehand..seems like a scam to me..."}
{"text":"I give this 2 stars just because the waiters are really friendly but the food is bland and the grilled items are just \"overcooked\" and missing flavor!  Wouldn't recommend it!"}
{"text":"So I ordered delivery from this restaurant today through SkipTheDishes and trust that I was incredibly surprised at the quality of the food.   I was expecting average food at best - let me just say - as someone who is picky and expects robust and intense flavours - this hit the spot on so many levels.  The sausage and beef manakesh is possibly better than at Paramount which I went to often as a child. Their shawarma is huge, seemingly made with freshly baked pita! They don't hold back on filling it with tahini and meat. It's huge - I have a big appetite but I could barely finish that shawarma.   I wish I had ordered from this establishment sooner - I plan to order again in the near future. The food is well priced, intensely flavoured and fresh - how can you go wrong?"}
{"text":"The best shawarma in Mississauga so far. The toppings are not cold and fresh which is perfect for the sandwich temperature. They press the sandwich in the panini machine which make it warm and tiny crispy"}
{"text":"Tip:- I only went there for Zatar pizza it was da bomb, freshly baked with oozing zatar and cheese.  Clean and contemporary ambiance.The service was great too I ended up having black tea and they actually went ahead and got me some milk which is not a norm in Arab tea drinking.  Will come try other food items soon."}
{"text":"With the amount of Middle Eastern restaurants popping up all over the city, these restaurants really need to stand out to be remembered and revisited.   Acadia is a pretty new place that has opened in the past year. It's very large and the tables are very spaced out.  They have a main menu and a separate dessert menu with a variety of desserts and juices. These were pretty pricy.  I had the Chicken Shawarma plate. It was decent, but there just wasn't anything about it that would get me to come back. I also enjoyed their chocolate cake, but there just wasn't a wow factor with any of it. I didn't have any problems with the service or the food, but it's not a place I would jump out of my seat to recommend."}
{"text":"I've grown up eating a lot of Lebanese food - every time I go to different areas in Toronto for Lebanese food I am disappointed BUT Acacia is now our go to! Discovered it last year when I was driving along Burnhamthorpe and I'm glad I did! This place is so welcoming, clean and sooooo delicious! The taste is so authentic and the prices are cheap considering the flavours and portions.  Always leave here happy!"}
{"text":"Hands down the most Authentic Lebanese joint in the GTA.   Keep in mind this is not a full service style restaurant. It is the Lebanese version of a fast food joint.   Being Lebanese myself this is the closest thing to back home eating I've had. The falafel is always fresh made to order and made from scratch, no powdered mix. The Foul is delicious and don't get me started on the kabobs. Hummus tastes like my mom makes.   My whole family are now regulars here. Soo happy there is finally some good Lebanese food in Mississauga."}
{"text":"(Sorry sweet server who constantly had a smile on her face and gave us free cookies!  My experience was dampered by your fellow waitress who looked as though she ate something rotten and couldn't care less.)  Good: -  portion size -  large, newly reno'ed restaurant that looks as though it can accommodate large groups -  food-wise, everything tasted fresh -  falafel tasted nicely seasoned -  meals come with 2 fresh, puffed pitas  Needs Improvement: -  menu NEEDS either photos/description.  It looks more like a take-out menu! -  waitress with don't care/sour face -  had to flag staff down for help -  water never refilled -  after asking for takeout box, sour waitress just flung it onto the table and left -  I don't think cookies/baklava are made in-house.  Baklava is pre-packaged in clear containers, so you can't buy different pieces  Dinner Plate comes with either rice/fries.  I got the rice, lots of it, but it was NOT seasoned, therefore a bit difficult to eat it all!  I would prefer less rice, but better tasting.  And \"side salad\" that came with dinner plate was more like sandwich fixings, so I found it hard to eat on its own.  Minus *s due to service.  A coupla of the waitresses looked as though they were doing whatever they could to avoid coming to tables.  I also had to ask how the ordering worked, no one greeted us.  Food is not good enough to come back for more attitude."}
{"text":"Worst experience you'll ever get. The service is the worst. It's like coming to a drive through at your local fast food restaurant were the server will tell you their life story instead of asking for your order. If i recall correctly, I was their to eat or pick up food and expect the food to come at a reasonable time. I waited over 17 minutes to get a beef/chicken shawarma ... were i saw other customers get their food before me even though i order before (Does it really take that long to put together a shawarma when there are only 3 customers in the restaurant?). When i complained in regards to the time it took and requested to get my money back, they refused to go through the process and wasted even more of my life.  Terrible service, overpriced food, non-existant customer service.  Avoid like the plague, if i could rate this any lower i would."}
{"text":"It is surely better than Paramount down the street but still not much that will send me back there. I don't think they understand what hot sauce is which peculiar for this type of restaurant?"}
{"text":"I would usually start a review with a few pros about the restaurant, but my experience left such a sour taste in my mouth I actually cant think of any. I didnt see one server or cashier with a smile, I could sense an attitude with every word uttered from any of them. We never received anything after asking the first time. We didnt get our pitas until after our meal came, were not offered drinks or were given water even after we asked 2 times. The servers dont even try to make eye contact as they walk past you, the food wasnt anything special either. The rice was bland, the kafta was extremely oily, the lettuce looked like it was scooped from a week old plate of left overs. Overall, do yourself a favor and do NOT even give this place a thought. Avoid it, there are 2 paramounts within 5 minutes of this place (Erin mills town centre, Heartland)."}
{"text":"Great Lebanese Food! If you know what their food about you have to visit. The place is clean and food is so fresh. Will be back!"}
{"text":"HALAL  We always drove by this place and wanted to try it. Finally did!  This is a nice restaurant that's located in a busy little area. The restaurant inside is very clean and the atmosphere is inviting and fun. They have Arabic music playing and you can smell the food.  The food is delicious! We tried the chicken shawarma sandwich and the mixed shawarma plate. The chicken sandwich tasted delicious! There was just the right amount of garlic sauce, tender chicken, and none of that unnecessary tomato or other vegetables that should not be in a shawarma. The plate was also just as delicious. Their beef shawarma surprised me because it was tender and cooked to perfection and marinated perfectly, Every bite of the beef strip was savoury. I've been to other places where the beef wasn't cooked proper or some pieces were undercooked and others overcooked. Not this place.   To top it off, their service was great! So attentive and on-point! Hope they keep it up!!"}
{"text":"New middle Eastern Lebanese food restaurant at the corner of Central parkway West and Burnhamthorpe Rd.  Large and spacious, clean and very well renovated.  Super friendly waitresses and became even friendlier, when we were told them we were yelpers.  They asked why we were taking photos.  Huge selection of fresh fruit juices and exotic desserts.  Also very tasty.  A little on the pricey side though; $5 per fruit juice.    We had the lamb, chicken skewer plate with long, grain basmati rice.  Meat was moist and tasty.  We also ordered a dip made of egg plant called Kebbeh.  The garlic sauce that went with the meats was awesome.  Just breathe hard on someone after that!    The washrooms were very clean and brand new.  Place is also brightly lit with LED pot lights and pretty, sparkly chandeliers.    Oh, forgot to mention that the hummus was very tasty too but the hot sauce mixed with the hummus was even better!  Gave it a punch!  We'll definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"Last week I met a couple friends here to try a new place.  Id start by saying that their food is very delicious. Slow, home-cooked, flavourful dishes that really had great tastes.  Honestly, I'd probably give this place a 5/5 if it wasn't for one really weird thing. The owner/operator was kind of scolding his waitresses to clean our table quicker, take our menus away, & remove our dishes and it was pretty awkward. He really seemed upset with them over nothing and they were doing a fine job.  I don't know...it just didn't sit right with me. The waitresses had been very pleasant all night and he was really condescending to them. So yeah. 4/5 stars. You shouldn't do that kind of stuff in front of your guests/ patrons.  Great food but owner may be a slight douchebag"}
{"text":"So Suresh Doss tweeted a pic of Acacia's Chicken and Beef Shawarma plate and it was inevitable that I was going to make the trip deep into Mississauga sooner or later.  We showed up around lunchtime on a Saturday and the joint was pretty much empty. We walked up to the counter, ordered our food, and took a seat at the impressively expansive dining area. Minutes later, a friendly waitress brought our food over and we dug in.  I had, of course, ordered the aforementioned Chicken and Beef Shawarma plate (\"mixed beef and chicken shawarma, served with vegetables, garlic sauce and tahini sauce\") and was immediately intimidated by the amount of food on offer.  The description doesn't mention the rice but the plate comes with an enormous portion. Luckily it's delicious and goes perfectly with the meat and two sauces. It's good, as are the vegetables, but the real star here is the meat. It's juicy and flavorful, and chock full of those crispy pieces you crave when you order a shawarma.  The one thing I found a little odd was the delivery of two freshly-baked pitas about midway through our meal. Free food is always welcome but I was a little baffled as to what I was supposed to eat the bread with. (I nevertheless ate a good portion of it, it was that good.)"}
{"text":"This is a food court style eatery. You first order at the back counter and tell them where you will be sitting. Once you've sat down they will serve you drinks (and if you didn't order drinks, they will offer complimentary water). This is followed by serving you with freshly baked pita bread. Eat it when it's hot and soft. Then they will serve your order and bon appetite! (all in about 15 mins; very fast service.)  You can get full with $10 of food here. I usually get the beef & chicken shawarma plate. Very fulfilling and tasty.  They've had a few minor hiccups in their service at times, like they would forget to give you pita bread at the beginning or just walk pass you without asking if you wanted water. Sometimes they even forget give you all the right sauces and dips that go with your order. But don't hesitate to call upon the 3-4 servers they have running around all the time.  Justification for 3 stars; Great food, fills up the tummy but at times you may go unnoticed there.  I'd come here again to hang out with my friends since it's considered a cheap eat."}
