{"text":"Always wanted to try the Pho at this place and today I did!.... Won't ever again,,, it's got everything you don't want in a restaurant..... Blaah...."}
{"text":"The pho is subpar. I ordered their plain vanilla pho combination.  They had very small portion of noodle and meat.  The price was higher than most other pho places. I will never come back for pho. But a footnote, the place did say \"Sub & Grill\". It is a small place runs by a 2 people. I didn't try any of their other entre on the menu."}
{"text":"The pho was tasty and soup was flavorful, their subs are delicious. The only negative comment i have is that the pho has lack of meat. I ordered their beef pho special and their were hardly any meat. For about $9.25 regular size, i expected a little more. The rare beef was not rare at all. The beef was cut to thick. But the broth made it worth while on a cold snowy day."}
{"text":"Good sate beef, spicy. Except barely any beef a bit disappointed, mostly noodles. $13"}
{"text":"Our favourite Vietnamese place in the city to go for both vermicelli and pho and we've tried at least 15 other places. Don't miss the satay soup...best I've ever had. Lovely family working there as well."}
{"text":"Food: 2/5 Service: 3/5 Overall experience: 2/5  (1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)  I was really craving a sub that day so I decided to try Vietnam Sub and Grill since most Vietnamese restaurants in the area didn't serve it. I can't really say much about this place, but based on first impressions this 'mom and pop' shop is disorganized with take out boxes piling up in the back. It is also very cramped where majority of the restaurant is taken up by their kitchen. You have a choice of take out or stay in, but there weren't very many seats (about 2-4 near the door).   You can order pho (Regular $9.50; Large $10), subs ($6-$7), vermicelli ($10), and even bubble tea. This is really expensive for Vietnamese food, especially their subs.  I decided to get the cold cut and beef sate sub. The cold cut was pretty bland but the beef sate was full of flavour and the meat was moist. Along with a yummy soy sauce/mayo mix, it made for a tasty sub. However, I couldn't get over the fact that the bread was soggy, stale, and tough to eat. I was just so disappointed and annoyed.  Although there aren't many choices for Vietnamese/Pho in the area (I can count about 3-4), I wouldn't recommend you come here."}
{"text":"Subs are not bad. Vermicelli was sub par. Not tasty. The new Vietnamese restaurant in Evanston Pho nomnom is much better."}
{"text":"I love this place.  When I am looking for a more flavourful soup I go here. The Satay soup is nice and spicy with lots of flavour.   Other places I frequent make good Satay but does not pack the flavour of this soup. This is a hidden Gem in the North."}
{"text":"I order the peanut satay soup and would gladly order it again. It's full of flavor ad the portion is perfect."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced Vietnamese Subs filled with fresh flavour."}
{"text":"Gone here a couple of times most of the times were okay but I'm very. disappointed today and will not come back again. Ordered a satay beef sub and the portions are cut down in half of what it was before and they're sill charging 7$. So not worth it and the toppings were decent but again portions less than other places in china town, and the drinks are not worth it. If you're not really craving Vietnamese subs or pho find a different place."}
{"text":"I'm gonna have to agree with Queenie on this one, bleah!!!!  Subs were just ok, and the bread was stale for me too.    Shrimp Salad rolls didn't have enough shrimp, I really HATE it when the shrimp is sliced in half on the vertical to trick the patron to believe they are actually getting 3 whole shrimp, but no, I got screwed and got a measly 1.5 shrimp per roll.  This really bothers me considering how much the ingredients cost.  Didn't bother with the pho, because pho to go is not the same so I ordered a grilled lemon grass chicken dish with the typical rice, veg and sauce and found it uninspired.  The place seems more like a to go place, so I wouldn't eat in with my family.  Also noticed a bunch of kids in the back, don't know if they work there or are family members but that turned me off.  One little girl checked me out and took payment, hmmm.  Won't be back with the vast amounts of Vietnamese places in the NW, this one doesn't make the cut for me even though the lady who took my order was super nice."}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place at all.  Just another Vietnamese restaurant in an all ready saturated market.  There is another Viet restaurant 400m away next to T&T supermarket, and at the time I write this ANOTHER Viet restaurant is opening soon only 200m away in an adjacent strip mall.  The first indicator that this place is going to be sub-standard may be observed before food arrives at the table: the bowls of Pho are available in one size only. Its weird, but in my experience Viet places that dont have S, M, and L are gonna be lousy. Weird but true.  So, my one size fits all Pho was warm (NOT hot), oily, and really lacking in flavour. Plus, it was just plain over priced at around $8.  My friends submarine was not BAD, but not remarkable either. Just average, and again slightly overpriced.  Its a Vietnamese restaurant, right? Well when I was there, an awkward white guy brought the food to the table har har har! If you get a pot of tea (free at REAL Viet places) it will set you back a couple dollars here.  I personally wont return, but I do wish the owners luck. Being one of three Viet restaurants within 400m of each other means you are going to have to be either extraordinary with your food and service, or have extraordinary prices. RIght now you have neither and the future isnt bright."}
