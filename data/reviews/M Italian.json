{"text":"I had such a great evening at M Italian. Our waitress was phenomenal! She was prompt, funny and knowledgeable about the menu. The food was delicious I ordered the Wedding soup, Italian meatball and mushroom pizza from the Happy Hour Menu. The meal was DELICIOUS! The Wedding soup was created from a family recipe and it was so flavorful, it warmed the soul. The Italian meatballs were moist and tender. The tomato sauce and cheese that topped this dish raised the flavors of a simple meatball; to meatball perfection in a dish...I will order this again! The pizza was cooked well and made with quality ingredients. The food portions were generous. I was able to take food home to eat for lunch the next day.        At the conclusion of my meal, the manager stopped by our table to ask about our evening. He was a pleasure to meet. After talking with our party of 4, he sent over a sample drink for our party to try. Of course, it was DELICIOUS! Needless to say, I will be a regular patron at M Italian. I will update my comment after my next visit to include the names of the wonderful people who made my evening special."}
{"text":"Overall I give it an ok ranking jut because it's not great,  it's right at the cusp of just ok and good.. The ambiance is great , open kitchen concept, open bar , great happy hour & reasonable pricing on the menu makes it a local spot to check out. It's got all the makings of a great place but the service just lacks that crispness one would expect & food also needs a little TLC work... $2 Peroni's on Tap , that's a whole different story! Definitely coming back for drinks @ the bar but not so sure I'll be going out of my way to plan a dinner here."}
{"text":"In a nutshell, have you ever gone out to dinner and as you are walking back to your car you look at other restaurant menus or diner's plates to see what you missed?  That just happened.   Location is great. The design of the restaurant is excellent with an indoor/outdoor approach that makes it airy and bright. The problem issues are pronounced; service for us was weak (forgotten drinks, prolonged wait at table for initial order, cleared the plates by scraping them all at my seat rather than simply carrying the plates to the kitchen), \"pizza oven was backed up\" resulting in a long wait, food was better than the service but not great (ravioli was the best). I'll go back but it needs to be much better than tonight to earn my business moving forward."}
{"text":"Went to dinner with group of friends on Saturday night and the place was jumpin!   First off, this place is really cool, with lots of space but a bit loud.  That's okay though.   The location in downtown Chagrin Falls is great but, as everyone knows, the parking situation can be a challenge.  Definitely use the complimentary valet!   The decor inside is a trendy warehouse chic.  We sat by the open kitchen where all the action is.  Those guys busted their butts all night!  However, there were some snafus!  Cold soup, cold pizza, cold pork chop and an unexpected piece of plastic in a meatball.  The manager was quick to respond to everything but it did delay some of our groups meals and became the talk of the evening!   Once we all received our meals, everyone enjoyed them.  We will return because we've had great experiences before.  I'm chalking it up to an \"off night\"!"}
{"text":"This is a great eatery.   The food and service is nothing less than outstanding.   One exception though.  A guy had his large dog in the outdoor area.  Although the dog was on a leash, he nosed up to people while they were eating.  The owner paid little attention, and when he did, he falsely believed that other diner's smile at his dog's interference was acceptance.  One could easily see that one woman was not pleased with the dog nosing around them, as her smile was a grimace of disfaction .  Additionally,  the large dog blocking the aisles where people, including servers had to walk around, also presented a near tripping hazard.  Lastly, we noticed one of the servers stopped to pet the dog,  then proceeded to pick up food for waiting guest.  All without washing her hands.   Lastly, management should have played him in a location (outer table )where his dog would not interfere with other diners.  Can not give 5 stars like I normally do for a good eatery.  I was contacted by a representative.  She said that people with animals will be seated at the bar.  I explained to her is where the dog owner was seated .   No change."}
{"text":"Really great new concept. Pizza is fantastic!!! Had the Italian sour which had amaretto, fernet, lemon juice, simple syrup and egg white, which was absolutely delicious!! Go early for happy hour for the best deals from 3-6pm everyday of the week."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Our server Stephanie was VERY good, and she took care of a small issue for us when our entrees came out too early. She made our dining experience here very good. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"we had lunch today At M Italian. The service was excellent, the food very good. I had combo of Cob salad and Turkey Panini. Price was appropriate. we will definitely return."}
{"text":"Good food with decent service. I live right around the corner and have been for dinner a couple times. The food is usually consistent. The bread they serve before dinner is amazing and always fresh! I am a big fan of the decor. There can be a wait for a table but I have never waited longer than 15 minutes. If the weather is nice - the patio is a great place to have a drink. We will be back"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic restaurant. The bread is awesome as well as the pizza, salads, and paninis. Waiter was very nice and helpful! Great outdoor scene. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We stopped by on Saturday night for dinner and drinks. The bartenders were great and so were the drinks. The atmosphere is nice but loud. The food, not so good. We ordered a 4 cheese pizza and it was just bland. No flavor. No spices. Nothing.   This is a great place for drinks and people watching. It is very nice in the warm weather. If you want first-rate pizza and drinks, head over to the Crumb & Spigot."}
{"text":"The staff is alright for the most part but most of them could be more pleasant. The pizza is soggy 90% of the time that pasta is average but it just isn't worth what they are charging."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Thursday night during rush. We didn't have reservations, but we're seated immediately at the pizza bar. Great ambiance, even crowded it wasn't very noisy. The staff was attentive and friendly, and made sure to mention appetizers and desserts. The food was excellent, I had the carbonara, which was the perfect serving size. My friend went with the farmhouse pizza, which he greatly enjoyed. This is definitely a place we will return to."}
{"text":"This is our family's favorite spot for a night out or when we have guests. We enjoy the atmosphere and the food very much. The service is always consistently good as well. After having moved to the area from NYC, we are lucky to have this restaurant as an option in the Chagrin Falls / Solon area."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great service and the best atmosphere!!! We got the farmhouse pizza and it knocked our socks off. We will definitely be back and will be bringing more people with us."}
{"text":"Great staff and delicious food. Gluten free options and something for everyone. Even my pickiest child is happy here!"}
{"text":"Dinner last night was a winner!  Our server, Ashley, was outstanding... one of the best servers we've had anywhere.  They start you with a plate of dipping oil and a hot bread round, both had a really great taste.  We shared the shrimp and calamari, which was lightly breaded and not overcooked (only negative, just three shrimp).  For entrees, we ordered the S&S and the Antoinette.  Both had excellent flavor and the pasta was perfectly al dente.  We shared a bottle of Chianti, which was really good.  We loved the lively, fun atmosphere.  It is noisy when there are a lot of people, but that's not a huge surprise.  (If you're looking for a quiet, romantic place, go elsewhere.)  The complimentary valet parking makes it easy to get in and out."}
{"text":"From the heavenly loaf of bread to the free Aperol Spritzes brought to first-time visitors; from the brick oven-blistered mushroom pizza and small chopped salad, everything here is perfection, including the waitstaff and little touches perfected by the Burntwood Tavern group."}
{"text":"Went twice and both times service was poor and food was subpar. Had been excited because I love Burntwood tavern but this was a huge disappointment. Won't be back again"}
{"text":"Food is not good and way over priced for what you get. Pizza is soggy, pasta is way to oily. Bread is a hit or miss. Drinks over priced and premixed. Wait staff seems stretched thin. Setting doesn't feel special. The bathrooms smell. Valet was slow."}
{"text":"Happy Hour at M Italian in Chagrin Falls is a blast. The place is jumping and the staff is great. Owner, Bret Adams, has another winner! Also see Lunch and Dinner Menu here: http://www.mitalian.com"}
{"text":"This place is perfect for happy hour with friends or date night! The table bread is amazing! The pizza is thin and crispy, made with fresh ingredients right before your eyes. I am eager to go back to try the mushroom pizza and the turtle brownie. Happy hour is 7 days a week 3-6pm. If you are a first timer you will be greeted with a free champagne and apricot liquor cocktail. Staff is very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"We received a gift card for Christmas to M Italian and wow we had an excellent Italian dinner.  Walked into beautiful rustic hip restaurant in downtown Chagrin Falls.  It was still happy hour at 5PM on a Saturday night so we ordered a couple Peroni draft beers at $2 and at that price we still had few more Peroni beers with our dinner.  We both ordered the house salad which was a very nice fresh salad with pancetta, gorgonzola and sweet and sour vinaigrette. Excellent. My husband ordered the Pasta M (cavatelle, hugh meatball with red pomodoro sauce) and I ordered the Lasagna (bolognese, parmasan cream sauce and red pomodoro sauce).  Both pasta dishes were EXCELLENT!!!!!  I asked for extra pasta sauce for my lasagna and they actually brought an extra bowl of sauce.  Excellent.   Oh no, I forgot to mention the bread!  Excellent again! The best ever!  We will be back very soon M Italian!  P.S. We sat at the bar and bartenders were very busy but always checked on us to make sure everything was ok."}
{"text":"This was my third visit to M Italian. The food has consistently been good. The service, unfortunately, is a little uneven at times. Delivery was slow on water, bread, refills, etc. on this particular visit. The bread and main courses came out at the same time. A manager made the round at tables asking about the food - and it was delicious! Our group had a zucchini noodle pasta dish with feta and kalamata olives (so different and really good!), a pesto pasta and another pasta dish made with local sausage and portobellos. The portions were hearty - most pasta dishes were in the $13-15 range.   We were happy to be enjoying a summer-like day in early October and dined outside - beautiful setting. It was a great spot for lunch in between films at the Chagrin Documentary Film Fest!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Brunch, lunch, happy hour, dinner, dessert.. it's all great! And the atmosphere is nice too! Been here several times and always had great service. The outdoor patio seating in the front is really nice, even on cooler days (they have heat lamps). Couldn't think of a single bad thing about this place."}
{"text":"A group of us went to dinner last night.  There were 16 of us which I realize is a large group. However I made the reservation almost 2 weeks in advance.  I specifically asked the young lady on the phone if they could accommodate our larger group.   She said they could.  I also specifically asked for patio seating.  She assured me that this was  no problem.  We arrived for our 8 pm reservation and were seated inside.  When I complained, I was told patio seating was not guaranteed.  That is not what I was told on the phone and I got an attitude from the snooty little hostess about it.  The patio was the main reason we chose this spot.    We were taken to  our seats.  The restaurant has no fans and it was sweltering inside.  We were uncomfortable.  It took 25 minutes to get our drinks.  The water on the table was warm and we had to ask for ice.  We had one waitress and we should have had 2.  The wait for our food was excessive as well.  All of our bills were incorrect.  One couple's bill was incorrect even after 4 times.  We sat down at 8 and we were still dealing with incorrect bills at almost 11.    Now I realize mistakes happen.  It's how the establishment deals with them that counts.  The minute I complained about our reservation a manager should have come over to talk with me.  Due to the epic screw up with our bills, they did comp drinks for some of us (not all of us).  However this was done way too late.  Some of us had already paid.  It wasn't until some members of our group were waiting at the valet that they offered gift cards.  Awful!  The food was good but I would not return based on the service and how the management handled things.  They cannot accommodate big groups.  I will not go back."}
{"text":"We went there on a Sunday and had happy hour, I'm not going to complain about that $2 Peroni's on draft, good happy hour food,  I liked it and I definitely coming back for dinner"}
{"text":"I don't see what the big deal is with this place. The food was on par with Bravo- not bad but not especially good either. They give you this dumb loaf of bread with the meal that isn't cut and it's a pain in the ass to eat. Really cool big marble bar and the pass from the kitchen is also marble. Again not bad but unless you're into the chic look of the place I would go somewhere else."}
{"text":"We arrived on a weekend to an open air restaurant with a cool vibe - fire going in the back for the pizzas, the rolling doors open to the 90 degree air, and a glass blowing shop with 3 kilns open in a connected by a hallway provided a toasty environment. Perfect for a July day....Anyway, it took our order (2 pizzas, 2 paninis) over an hour due to a party of 22 people being hosted and the kitchen not understanding how to keep up with orders for the rest of the us. They then forgot my husband's order, and delivered a turkey sandwich as the other plates were being cleared. The final annoyance was the waiter, while apologizing for the delay, spilled the olive oil used for dipping bread down my husband's brand new sport coat. The food was not that great, and the service leaves a lot to be desired. We found it to be more of a \"I just got done biking and I want to drink a beer and then bike home\" kind of place instead of a sit down restaurant..."}
{"text":"My husband and I just came from M Italian and could not be happier to have stumbled upon this gorgeous restaurant! First of all, when they found out that it was our first time dining with them they sent over the cutest drinks to say \"welcome\". We started dinner off with the Salmon Tartar and it was excellent. They serve each table the most fresh and fluffy bread as well, that was simply amazing!  I ordered the Salmon salad, and my husband order a pasta dish that had cheese stuffed pasta shells and chicken, in a creamy sauce and they were both absolute perfection. The manager stopped over to check on us and overheard my husband say that next time we are back he plans on trying their famous meatball. She surprised us by sending one over, on the house! Talk about attention to detail. When they finally realized we had just gotten married 2 days ago, they had the head chef stop out to our table and greet us personally. To top that off, we were sent 2 glasses of champagne, dessert, and our entire meal was taken care of....like we literally paid for nothing. I am so moved by the thoughtfulness of this staff, not to mention that the food would have been worth every penny regardless!  The restaurant itself is gorgeous! It reminds me of a mix between Restoration Hardware and Arhaus because the decor is stunning. Bonus...their wine bar is beautiful and there is an amazing fire pit on their front patio. The menu is also well rounded and very reasonably priced considering the dishes you get. I am actually surprised it's not more expensive. I could have ordered 1 of everything! We absolutely plan on being frequent visitors of this place, and I encourage anyone looking for a lunch/dinner spot to check them out!!"}
{"text":"Was there on August 27.  The food was great, but...  We were in formal wear for an event in town and it had to be at least 83-85 degrees inside the restaurant.  It was AWFUL.  We were miserable.  The waitress did once get the thermostat turned down, but the second time we asked, she said \"It's as far down as it will go.\" That bar that is half inside/outside does not help.  That, with the ovens and the glassblowing next door made it hot as hell.    The other problem they have is they have no blowers to keep the flies and gnats out.  We were attacked by the bugs, which got even worse after the meal arrived.  The meal was tremendous.  I had a seafood risotto, which was the special that night.  So good, but ruined by the heat and the bugs.    I tweeted about it while I was there, and M Italian tweeted back, asking for my email.  I thought I'd get to talk to them about it.  Gave them my email, but never heard from them again.  One other thing - the death spikes that surround the patio.  Their patio has a low lying wall with these metal spikes sticking up from them.  All it will take is one person who trips or a drunk person who falls on these spikes and either maims or kill themselves and they'll have a lawsuit on their hands that may do them in.   If I ever go back, it will only be during the cool months when the outside portion of the bar is closed so there's no bugs or temperature problems to encounter.  Too bad, because the food is so good."}
{"text":"When because my wife who's birthday it was wanted to go. The atmosphere was really nice! Outside and inside! Enjoy the complementary valet parking. Once we entered we where greeted promptly and warmly. It took 30 minutes to be seated. Not bad. Food was good but not amazing! Stake was good and my wife enjoyed the food. All and all it was nice. But we'll probably go to Jackals to which is our favorite and right down the way."}
{"text":"My fourth and last visit to M Tavern.  I am admitting defeat.  The other restaurants in this group are not run as poorly.  At none of the 4 visits was our table ever ready on time, no matter how early we come.   Our server, a seemingly nice enough guy, never came back to ask how things were.  We literally had to flag down someone to help us.   Ordered lobster bisque & a margarita pizza.  Bisque was served room temperature and pizza was barely warm.  The food is so uneven.  Too much of dinner with friends was spent dealing with food and service.   Of course, they took care of the check but still resulted in not a nice evening out."}
{"text":"Very good food and service! Always enjoy coming here! Always make sure you make reservation; otherwise, you're going to have a long wait. Also just found out today that their happy hour is 7 days a week from 3 - 6. That's a big plus!"}
{"text":"OMG the meatball appetizer was amazing!!!  A little spicy and served with ricotta.  Gotta go back just for that!  We really enjoyed our entire meal.  Everything was good but particularly that meatball.  We arrived at 7 with a reservation and were seated immediately.   Valet was easy.  Space was beautiful although loud.  Still a lively spot in Chagrin."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  Must try. We had a large party for lunch on a Saturday morning.  Our service was great!  The fresh bread was ah-mazing."}
{"text":"There is nothing that stands out about this place one way or another.   Exterior: It's got a great Location in Chagrin Falls, one of the few decent restaurants in town. It's the old ski shop location   Interior: lots of wood. Rustic looking. There is a very large bar and a really nice patio. When the weather is nice, the patio is the perfect place to hang out. In the winter, the patio is under cover and heated... which is nice  Clientele: the good, bad and ugly of Chagrin Falls. If you are from this area, you know what I'm talking about. You can run into anyone you might know here. Don't go looking homeless, because you absolutely will run into somebody.   Attire: casual. Jeans are fine.  Food: good enough but not fabulous. It's Italian. Simple but not anything I would crave. You will not have a bad meal here. Your meal will always be, \"ok\".  I'm not a great cook, but some of my meals could be as good as theirs.   Final thoughts: it's got a great patio and vibe. I mostly end up there when I don't feel like leaving Chagrin Falls and I want to go out to eat. Worth trying.... you might like it."}
{"text":"very disappointing. service was extremely slow. food was mediocre  the pizza was was average at best. not a memorable experience"}
{"text":"Finally went here. We made a reservation for dinner.  Cool atmosphere with a broad age range of dining patrons.  It can get a little loud in there at times, and given that the tables are situated pretty close together, don't even try and have a quiet conversation.  Service was attentive.  The house-made loaf of bread with the oil/balsamic is ridiculously good. I could have easily eaten 4 loaves of that.  I went with whatever side salad is listed first on the menu and served with Sweet n sour dressing. Another winner. Delicious mix of flavors in that salad.  So, the entreé...I went with the browned butter sage gnocchi...and cue the disappointing music...The gnocchi was way overcooked and gummy.  The browned butter/sage sauce had more citrus notes to it and it was sweet.  The pine nuts couldn't save it.  Perhaps I ordered the wrong thing, but what really creases me is the restaurant bills itself as an Italian restaurant so how in the world can you overlook your gnocchi?  The husband got the Carbonara.  I think it was under salted.  It wasn't the best carbonara I have tasted but it was respectable. The best Carbonara is at Dante, hands down.  I don't know if I will go back to M. I really want to say I will.  Perhaps I need to read other reviews and choose a different entree next time."}
{"text":"Went back twice this week.  Outside seating is great.  You can hear the other person.  Inside that's a real problem you can't hear anything and it's very stuffy!  Great chicken salad, but the crumpets of bread on the side were salty, salty.  Seems like you all like salt there!"}
{"text":"Loved our meal and. Atmosphere was great as well as service. Definitely a top pick for future dining."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my visit here. I went for happy hour, which is from 3:00pm-6:00pm 7 days/ week. During happy hour, all of the pizzas are $7 (normal price is $14). I would say that one pizza is probably enough to feed two people, so that's a super good deal. Drinks are also discounted during happy hour as well.  I had the chicken pizza which was exceptionally yummy and had a fried egg on top. Loved it!   Also the bread that comes before every meal is super good and accompanied by some fancy Italian olive oil dip which is great.   Overall, the place is a little pricey, but definitely affordable during happy hour. Pizzas are great, and atmosphere is fantastic. Will come back."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my meal at M Italian.  I ordered the lobster bisque.  It is done a little different here where you can see the olive oil added to the bowl.  I ordered a margarita pizza well-done.  Both the pizza and the bisque were very good with my preference leaning to the lobster bisque.  The service was a little slow especially when you consider how empty the restaurant was.  I come back  here again when I am in the area.  My only concern was parking was a bit difficult.  They did offer valet parking which I am not a fan of so I decided to park on the street which was limited."}
{"text":"I honestly did not like this place much when it first opened.  I have officially changed my opinion.  The calamari was excellent and the sauce was a perfect compliment.  The dipping sauce for the bread is also a perfect match and I had to ask for a second serving as I was drowning my bread in it.    We split a pizza and each had salads.  Everything was fresh and tasted great.  Their fired pizza was well done and the crust was as expected for a good quality pizza.  Our server was very friendly, attentive, and we never waited a long time for refills or checking on us for drinks.    My only complaint about it here is that it's honestly really busy and you feel that when you arrive and try to get your table or a seat at the bar.  The outside patio fortunately mitigates this, but it is a busy feeling place.  Again, our server was great and we never felt the hustle once seated.  I have passed this place before when I look in the front and see the crowds.  But am glad I came back as the food was great."}
{"text":"Tried very hard to eat here tonight and an hour and a half later had to leave. We were walk ins so I expected a wait, and a very friendly manager assured me it was no problem and he could accommodate our walk in Party quickly. Now I realize that he was so quick to offer such assurance because he had no intention of backing it up.   Over the next hour and a half we sipped at the bar and watched our table get given away twice before our eyes. Every time it came with a story about how someone else had \"just paid their check\" and their table would soon be ours. Then when that table was given away there was someone he \"forgot about\" and another excuse. I then heard him have the same line to another party right next to us and realized the ruse. Glad they are so popular but won't be for long if they keep lying to keep people at the bar with no intention of serving them. Too bad."}
{"text":"The food has improved over the years.  In time I think the restaurant has the ability to really soar.  It's ambiance and location is second to none, in any season.  The bread is some of the best Cleveland has to offer and is the best thing I have tasted on the menu.  The food is generally better then average and is consistently good, but never outstanding.  This is a fun spot in a great location."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices and fun atmosphere. Happy hour is the best way to experience this place, offered 7 days a week!"}
{"text":"It's so great to have such selection in Chagrin Falls.  But having eaten there lately, I must say that thing that rocks is the outside enclosed in area.  In the main part it's really loud and hard to hear.  Like the vallet.  Really only option.  No parking in Chagrin.  Nice addition"}
{"text":"The space is vast; the bar is really long; it was too cold to sit on the patio, but it had a fire pit. There's a glassblowing place next door. The food was good. The service was excellent. They gave my uncle and me special complimentary cocktails because we were first-time guests at the new restaurant. The cocktails were the best, containing aperol, prosecco, and an orange rind garnish. Not too sweet. I ate the garnish."}
{"text":"Just ate here for my sisters birthday party! The interior has a beautiful industrial feel that I love, and the fact that you are next to a glass blower provides an extra something to look at if your able to sit by that window. The complimentary valet parking is invaluable, especially during the busiest hours it can be near impossible to find parking in chagrin falls, but this takes all of the hassle out of it for you.   They start your meal with some quite tasty homemade bread, dipping oils, and parmesan.  For appetizers we had calamari and mussels both of which were good but each had a bit of heat to it. I ordered the pear and honey salad which was phenomenal, one of the best salads I've had, perfect mix of sweet and crisp flavors!!  As an entree I had the pumpkin ravioli which was also soo delicious!!   M was kind enough to give us champagne and gelato as a celebration for the birthday girl. Had such a great time and meal!"}
{"text":"Greeted at the door by both the hostess and the manager  after a hard day at work.  The manager and staff provided great service along with delicious food!  The bartender made sure we were aware of happy hour specials and rapidly took our order to get it in before happy hour ended.   Even ordered each of us a back up beverage.  She recommended the meatball appetizer and pizza.  It was phenomenal!  The meatball was very tender and the pizza was cooked perfectly in a wood fired oven.  The atmosphere couldn't be better.   You can enjoy watching people taking glass blowing classes next door.  To end our evening the manager came over with an after dinner shot and to make sure that they helped make our day better.  That they did!   So reasonably priced too!   We had 5 peronis, a pizza and meatball appetizer all for only $25!!!  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely AMAZING! The food is wonderful! There are so many great opinions and they can even do gluten free pasta! My server was beyond polite! This restaurant is very unique and unlike anywhere I've eaten at before! There is also a really cool glass blowing place next door so when you are done, you can go look there (they offer classes!) this restaurant doesn't deserve only 5 stars, they deserve 10! Definitely recommend this place! :)"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere at the bar. Food and wine selections were amazing. Elizabeth at the bar was very attentive and the service was fast even on a busy day. Enjoyed the M experience.  Would highly recommend this place.   Thx  DR MD"}
{"text":"Went on 7/13/2015 below par, over cooked pork chop, tepid soup, just an apology for the mix up no discount or offer of something to make up for the bad service. Then to add insult to injury the Valet left the lights on, killed the battery, then lied about it. Recommend this place if you want to overpay for average food, poor service and long waits."}
{"text":"Good restaurant with nice ambience. Came here on my first visit to Chagrin Falls. The bread is really good and also the dipping EVOO and sun dried tomato sauce that comes with it. Just wish we were given the bread early on while waiting for our meal. Didn't get appetizers because we were expecting the portions to be big. The salmon salad is pretty good. The salmon itself is a generous portion. Just wish there were more hearts of palm! Pork chop is good too with the crust and a generous portion of potatoes and broccolini. Will have to come back and try their pizza, pasta, and other dishes. Not much to say about the service. Maybe our waitress was having a bad day..."}
{"text":"Average, not bad, not great, just average. Came with parry of 15 (half kids, half adults), so had opportunity to try both kids and adults menu. Nothing memorable, just a typical American-Italian fare. Dessert menu is poor, it really needs to improve. The glass emporium store next door is really cool!"}
{"text":"Whenever we are looking for a place to go to eat that we know will be good not matter what we order, we usually go to M Italian in Chagrin Falls.  I've been there for happy hour quite often, dinner a number of times and lunch.  The food is always good and the service top notch.  The only downside, and it's minor, is that it can get a little loud in the restaurant when it's busy -- which is most of the time!  There is some parking nearby and they offer a valet so parking shouldn't ever be an issue.  When the weather is good, they open up the patio area (it's enclosed in cold weather) and it's a great place to sit and people watch.  I've enjoyed everything I've had here but I especially like the pasta dishes!  Also, they make a delicious Italian Moscow mule!"}
{"text":"Love this little city in Ohio, I am from Idaho and every time I visit I want to come to Chagrin Falls and dine at M. Atmosphere is amazing and food is delicious.  We had a great Happy Hour tonight with the mushroom pizza and Calamari... Delicious! But I have to give kudos to Liz, our server who chased me down the street to deliver my packages I had left behind! Thank you for being so attentive and caring after we paid the bill. I will be back and hope to have you again as a server, Liz to repay you for the extra mile tonight!"}
{"text":"The food is fairly good, but if service is important to you then go elsewhere. I've given this place three tries and to me three strikes and you're out. Two times we sat at the bar and two times we were treated like sh*#. Both different bartenders, the same story both times... I don't understand how someone can work in the service industry and not know how to serve and treat others. Both times the bartenders face spoke for themselves . Clearly they were upset by being understaffed or by something? Waited for over 10 minutes to even be greeted, and then when finally we were spoken to there was barely a hello... As if we were bothering them.  The third time we had a horrible server at the table the server was rude and also clearly felt they were too busy to pay attention to us. Now I don't know if it's the management at this place or just the servers but I refuse to spend that kind of money and get treated in the way I've been treated. I will never give them my business again and cannot figure out why this place is always busy??"}
{"text":"Love! I often crave Italian food, but I usually reserve it for times when I feel like splurging on carbs. I did not feel that way at M Italian. I ordered the hummus appetizer, which was served with fresh vegetables along with toasts, and I got the chicken parmesan, which came with a salad instead of pasta. Both were excellent.   I also love the atmosphere - the interior is beautiful and it looks like it has an awesome patio when the weather is nice (I went in the winter).   There is also a very cool glass blowing shop next door you can stop in on your next visit.  Overall, the best thing about M Italian is the service. When I went, it was packed and we sat at the bar. It looked like a bunch of local groups were having Christmas parties there that night. But despite the crowd, the service was perfect. I felt like I was the only one in the place. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Not good. Place is very noisy.my wife and i ordered salmon.it came with hard carrots  not cooked and  some still wirh roots on them.the salmon was hard and way over cooked smothered with oil and lemon.service took an hour and one half.not friendly service Never saw management."}
{"text":"The new M Italian opened and its well worth a visit. The food is tasty but you feel like would pay much at someplace else.  They started us with a great bread that's cooked in the pizza oven.   For lunch I had the Caesar salad and pesto pizza. My friend had the house pizza. We both had peroni draft beer. The pizzas are very sizable and I took half of mine home.   They have a great happy hour deals that you should check out yourself.   A great addition to the Chagrin Valley restaurant selection."}
{"text":"I'm surprised to see that not all the reviews are glowing here. This has turned into our go to Chagrin Falls spot. We've gone for lunch, brunch, happy hour (which is 7 days a week), and dinner and have never been disappointed. We've also brought many guests (including picky parents) and they've also loved it as well. I love the arancini balls (we order them every time), but have tried the carbonara, pumpkin ravioli, several pizzas, french toast, bacon wrapped dates...I mean, I could really go on. Bottom line, it was all delicious."}
{"text":"What a delight to eat here.  It's open air goodness!  I had the avocado toast as well as a zucchini appetizer.  Loved them both.  Service was attentive and it has a really nice view for the patio area.  Eating inside might get a little noisy.  It's certainly a stop next time I'm in the area.  Menu is rather large and most diners should find something to their liking."}
{"text":"While in the area we decided to stop in for lunch. At first appearance the restaurant is very nice and has a rustic upscale vibe. Large dining room inside and a large indoor/outdoor patio with plenty of seating. They have a very large bar with plenty of seating. Semi open kitchen with their wood fired pizza oven upfront and center. The service was friendly and accommodating. The menu has great selections from apps, salads, pizza, sandwiches, pasta's and main entrees.   Before we ordered they brought us some fresh baked bread with oil/vinegar for dipping. Both were delicious. My wife started with a Caesar salad. She absolutely loved it the lettuce was fresh and crispy and they used fresh white anchovies which are to die for. For her entree she had the seared salmon with baby carrots and green beans. Everything was fantastic. The salmon and veggies were seasoned and cooked perfectly. I ordered their carbonara pasta. The pasta was nice and aldente, perfect amount of sauce and the crispy bits of pancetta were great. I also had to try their pizza so I ordered the sausage and pepperoni pizza. For me the pizza could have been cooked a little longer to give it a nice crisp. But overall the pizza was good. Great lunch, if you have never been it's definitely worth stopping in."}
{"text":"Went with another couple to M Italian last night.  We got there early for our 8:00 reservation and sat and had a drink at the bar while waiting for our table.  We were seated on time and had a table outside.  It was a beautiful evening.  Our waitress did a great job and was very attentive.  I started with the strawberry arugula salad that was delicious and the amazing bread.  I ordered the pesto pasta.  It was loaded with pine nuts, sun dried tomatoes, and chicken.  Would definitely order again.  My husband ordered the vegan zucchini pasta and said he wants to go back tonight and order it again.  Definitely will be back.  Had a great meal and a great time!"}
{"text":"Horible food I think it's all frozen pre made  taste like it was frozen ,we ordered 2 pizzas pasta  wedding  soup was so salty I couldn't  eat it defiantly from can."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!!! The pizzas, pastas and salads are all amazing - you can't go wrong with any plate here! The free bread is also out of this world!! Great happy hour specials too!"}
{"text":"I've been to M twice now and it had become one of my favorite restaurants in the greater Cleveland area after my first visit. I would describe the atmosphere as trendy, yet cozy; I particularly enjoyed the outdoor fireplace and covered seating that they have during the warmer months. The house bread here, along with their garlic olive oil, is quite good, and I wouldn't mind having a meal of that alone on many a day. I've tried the Bolognese and the Porcini sacchetti and enjoyed both; the Porcini sacchetti is probably one of the best dishes of pasta I've ever had. I thoroughly enjoyed the richness and warmth of that particular dish; the only downside will be resisting the urge to order it in the future so that I can try the rest of their seemingly delicious menu."}
{"text":"It's my second time here. Both time it was good. Consistently good food and quick service. You must try happy hour!!"}
{"text":"Came with a party of  eight and we loved this restaurant! The place itself is airy and seems to be industrial inspired, including a view into a glassblowing studio. Wait staff was friendly, knowledgable about the menu and accommodating, bringing out my 3 year old nephews food early because he was impatient and having a hard time staying still.  They also gave a little birthday toast with the shots we ordered ( Not for the nephew, but he did get his own little Sherlee Temple to celebrate.) As a neat side note, the shot glasses were made in the glass studio next door!   The food was enjoyable and I feel the portions were generous. The complimentary bread was a great starter, especially with the herb infused olive oil dip. Enjoyed the turkey panini but my favorite was the Italian Wedding soup. Very flavorful! I look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Had lunch there today. The salads were amazing, our waiter was awesome. But there is a but....huge disappointment that they changed the bread. Would be great if they brought back the delicious bread they used to have."}
{"text":"We had a great lunch at M Italian! Great decor. Great service. Very generous portions, without being ridiculous. Wonderful flavors. Reasonable prices, too. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Food is outstanding, the wood fired pizzas are well made and tasty.  Sunday brunch menu looks good and includes bottomless mimosas for $12.  Can't beat that while watching the Browns game!"}
{"text":"Pasta dishes are good as usual.  The service is friendly but always pretty slow even when it's not busy.  The happy hour deals are pretty good and I do go fairly often.  I also like to get takeout from this place.  Other than the slow service (which I have come to expect and accept), my issue was with the birthday dinner I had with my family a few weeks back.  Everything was fine until they brought over a slice of cake with 3 spoons, as I was dining with my 2 year old and husband.  I figured it was a nice gesture, though I didn't care for it.  My husband and son did enjoy it though.  I did not know I was going to be charged for it but since my family liked it I was ok with that too.  (I was a bit surprised when the bill came since they didn't used to charge for the cake they brought over.)  The problem is I looked up the cake online later and saw that there is alcohol in the cake.  Furthermore, the alcohol in this particular cake doesn't get cooked, so none of it reduces/evaporates!  I don't think this is suitable to serve to a 2 year old, and we should have at least been warned."}
{"text":"The food is just OK it's almost like a cult following with the gentleman that owns all the burnt wood restaurants The only thing that really is any good is the meatballs"}
{"text":"I love Chagrin falls. It's a beautiful place and it's great to walk around. We found M based on a friends recommendation and we were told it's connected to the owners of burnt wood tavern so we tried it. I'll keep this short and sweet. Great food... Drinks are pre mixed... Service is horrendous. It's so interesting how management dictates an experience in the establishment. I've been to burnt wood, pacos taco, and M which I understand all share some ownership connection and all have the same thing; good food, but the worst service I've experienced in a long time"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try M Italian for awhile now, since I heard the owners of Burntwood would be opening a new restaurant. However, I was pretty disappointed. Maybe I just got the wrong menu item, I will definitely be back and willing to give the place another chance but I am not a fan of their flatbread. I got the Margherita as a takeout order and it was just full of grease. Maybe I'm just a red sauce lover but it was pure olive oil and garlic. Not my preference by any means. The place itself is much bigger and open than I was expecting. As with a lot of downtown chagrin restaurants, parking wasn't the easiest but they do have a separate lot in the back. Not enough for the number of patrons by any means though they do offer complimentary valet. There's a glass blowing shop right next door which I think is awesome! You can watch the blow glass through huge windows as you wait to be seated. I personally don't like the look of the weird fence at this place but hey, to each their own. Overall, I can see potential, pasta dishes looked good but I'll have to go back to try them for myself. I can't recommend the flatbread."}
{"text":"This is our go to happy hour spot. 3-6p, 7 days a week. Peroni draft beer for $2 and a great selection of house wines for $4, plus half off the awesome pizzas. They recently got rid of the spectacular muscles from the regular menu but the carpaccio luckily survived the cut. Amen sister!"}
{"text":"If I was writing a review only on the food I would give them 4 stars, however we had a reservation and still had to wait over 45 minutes outside to be seated at our table. Granted it was the Saturday before Mother's Day, but some consolation would have been nice considering this is a nicer restaurant.   Now on to the food... the bread and oil they give the table is delicious. The Caesar salad was great, but my anchovies seemed to be missing which was a little disappointing. The margherita pizza was great to share with the table and was tasty. For dinner I had the carbonara and it was very underseasoned. As in I asked for extra pepper and cheese and the chickens me sauce was still bland. I tried someone else's Salmon salad which was good, but again the Salmon was underseasoned.   Overall I think I would go back for lunch, but the long wait (even with a reservation) and bland food doesn't make the price that we paid for dinner worth it."}
{"text":"3.5-3 star food , 5 star service. I personally found the food to be a bit bland but the rest of my friends seems to think its pretty good. I think they may be restricted for choices in the area but hey what do I know. Anyway, moving on, the staff the always attentive and responsive. The atmosphere inside is nice, and the place is almost always busy.   Their pizzas are nice and having a wood fired pizza is always infinitely better than otherwise. The bar staff is good and can make the standard cocktails without butchering it and thats always a plus. They have happy hour 7 days a week with half priced appetizers which is a great deal.   Overall its not bad, its in a cute area to walk around once you have carb loaded on pasta and what not. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Good location. Not a real experience of Italy but an American version with sugar in the tomato sauce and many pasta dishes that include chicken which I have never  seen in 50 years of traveling and living in Italy. Disappointing."}
{"text":"We were invited to a preview/soft opening today. We are big fans of Burntwood Tavern and are also excited for Pacos Tacos & Tequila to open this summer. All owned by the same restaurant group.   That being said, the parking is not good, but then again Chagrin Falls is a small village like town with poor parking for all of its businesses. The decor is kick ass! Very modern and hip. They share the space with a super cool glass blowing business that supplies most of the artistic glass fixtures in the restaurant. We were greeted with a smile and immediately seated at the Pizza Bar. Yes that's right a Pizza Bar! That's pretty f*$#ing cool. Shortly after being seated we received our cocktails that were really good. We were then served complimentary bread that was just baked in the pizza oven and was also really good. We then shared the Caprese salad that was delicious. We were then presented with a pair of complimentary mini Bellini cocktails. Digging it! Our entrees looked great and tasted good for the most part. Both sauces were overly salted, but not to where we didn't enjoy the meal.  Bottom line is the service was impeccable. They really seem to care. The price is a bit high. We received a discount as part of the invite which was very cool but most of the restaurants in this area are $$$. They have a few recipe bugs to work out, but over all a great experience. We will go back and try other dishes with excitement. I recommend the meat balls and a whiskey cocktail."}
{"text":"My sisters and I had a great time at this restaurant.  The food is excellent and so is the ambiance. I had the meatball panini!  The best meatball sandwich I have ever had...once you go there you will want to go back!"}
{"text":"Nice happy hour but wish they had a better craft beer selection.  They only offer their mediocre Taberna house IPA, for $3 you get what you pay for.  Had the calamari and real wood fired pizza, very good, but left before we ordered dinner when they let children sit at the bar.  I don't want to share drinks and a meal with children and will not go back.  The last restaurant we ate at that catered to children at the bar was B Spot and I haven't been back in over three years."}
{"text":"Came for lunch on a Saturday. Manager gave us and surrounding guests, welcome spritzers! Service was good. Salad was flavorful and the chicken pizza was perfect. Pre-entree bread was savory and delicious paired with the olive oil dipping plate. Overall, great! Thanks M!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful meal, excellent staff and enjoyed watching the glass blowing business next store churn really cool pieces right from our table.  Our server was excellent.  The pizza was excellent and the gluten free pasta was as good as 'regular' pasta!"}
{"text":"I don't often give out 5 stars on a first visit, but dang! This place really impressed me! Here are the details: I met up with a friend for Saturday morning brunch. They have valet but I just parked on a side street and walked over. Inside decor has this romantic industrial vibe to it, and there is a big window where you can watch what is happening inside the glass blowing workshop next door. (Someone told me that M Italian is a sister restaurant with Burntwood Tavern and the glass shop made all of the glass decor for the restaurants).   Since we arrived shortly after 11am the place wasn't busy yet and we were seated right away. They have a lovely inside or there is a patio area outside with a bar dividing the two spaces. My only complaint is that it was a hot humid rainy day and they still had the windows/doors open that separate the inside from the outside. This made for a muggy feeling experience. Ordering a frozen peach bellini $9 did help though! It was served in a large glass and was enjoyable.  For food we both decided to get the eggs benedict $14. These aren't your average brunch dishes though! You get two garlic toasts topped with a zucchini and potato hash, two poached eggs, sauce, but you get to choose your meat! I went with a fresh crab cake and my friend chose the salmon filet. You also get a side of mixed fruit. Incredibly tasty meal and it will definitely fill you up! Oh and let's not forget the amazing round loaf of bread they give you as soon as you sit down! Deliciously thick soft warm bread with olive oil to dip it in.   Our server was pleasant and did her job very well, I think her name was Makenzie? At least that is what the receipt says. My friend and I had a very enjoyable brunch here and I would definitely go back!  Actually, since it's a solid 45 minute drive from where I live I decided to grab dinner to-go (don't judge me, I was already there and decided to take advantage). I went with a caesar salad $6 which came with anchovies. I was going to be brave and try them, but they went in the trash, just not for me. Now the pork tenderloin $14 was excellent! The pork was cooked perfectly and it came with this white bean, asparagus, and red pepper ragout. Mmm so good! They also threw in their tasty bread. I'd like to mention that I ate my dinner the next day so it stood up to being refrigerated and reheated!   We walked around the cute little Chagrin Falls area afterward. It was an all around good time and I would highly recommend you give them a try! Just a tip, the food tastes great, portion sizes are filling, service pleasant, and atmosphere great for a date, but go during brunch/lunch because the prices are lower so saving money on top of everything else is just going to make you love this place even more."}
{"text":"I would like to start off by saying that I love M and I frequent at least once a week. The food is great, the drinks are good too and I love the patio....   However.....upon my last visit I discovered that they no longer have asparagus. After getting over the initial horror, I decided I had to do something about it. So here is my attempt.   Dear M. We need asparagus back. My salmon is nothing without its tall, lean, and green counterpart.  It's one of the greatest vegetables in existence. It has over 101% daily value of vitamin K in on cup! Guess what vitamin K is good for? Dark circles. Guess who has dark circles? I do. Why? Because I'm at M late night throwing glasses of rosé back.   Furthermore, it's an anti-inflammatory and an anti-oxidant. It's the perfect side for any protein!   So please, the asparagus has to come back.   #BringAsparagusBack   Thank you!"}
{"text":"Always great food and amazing atmosphere! This cozy modern restaurant is seated in a really excellent location of downtown chagrin falls with a really cool people watching view. The food is always excellent and you absolutely can't beat their happy hour prices! Definitely recommend checking this place out. Great to grab drinks, for a causal business meeting, or a nice family get together."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! Happy hour 7 days a week with half price apps and pizza. Even without happy hour pricing their food is very fairly priced and never fails to deliver on flavor. I had passed by the place several times thinking it looked too expensive and boy was I wrong. The food is great, servers pleasant and attentive, cocktails are well balanced, and the manager always keeps an eye on everything. One bit of advice is to call ahead well in advance for large party reservations and it doesn't hurt to call ahead for happy hour, and yes they take reservations for happy hour which is not limited to the bar."}
{"text":"Paninis that aren't: warning,  the paninis are just cold cuts on toasted bread. Very disappointing if like me,  you expect a panini to be warm,  with the cheese melted at least a little bit. My salad (chopped) was OK.  Overall the meal was nothing that you couldn't get in most random delis for half the cost. My husband did like his pasta dish,  though."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place, the food of course, service, atmosphere and being right in the heart of Chagrin Falls. I would wait in line just for the bread. M is at the top of my favorite places to eat. Love the brunch items in the weekends, especially the ricotta pancakes."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm the first one to say this, but I didn't love the food here. I was expecting Burntwood quality, and I just don't think this place makes the cut. Granted I did go there on the first day it was open so I will give them a second chance, but the food I had on day 1 was subpar. The cons: I went for lunch with my family, some of whom have gluten allergies, so I was happy to see that they offer gluten free pasta. Unfortunately though, no gluten free pizzas; it would be great if they added that in the future! Since I am all about the gluten though, I ordered a lunch combo of a small pizza and a salad. Our food took a while to come out, like 40 minutes long, but hey since it was their 1st day, I'll let that one go. When they brought out the salads, I was confused because the combo I ordered included a salad, but I didn't get one. Our server told me it would come out with my pizza. So I patiently sat and watched everyone else eat their salads. Then our entrees arrived, including my 'salad' which consisted of roughly 4 pieces of lettuce drenched in dressing with 2 anchovie slices on top. And because it was on the same plate as my pizza that was just out of the oven, the salad was weirdly warm. So I skipped over that and headed to my pizza, which was a decent size for only being half of a combo. I chose the chicken pizza, which included a fried egg on top. I know that eggs on pizza are really trendy right now, but I've learned my lesson that I just plain don't like it. I cut my pizza and ended up with runny egg yolk all over my pizza, all over my plate, and all over my lukewarm salad... The pizza itself was decent, I appreciate the stone firing and the crust was good, but it was incredibly salty. Not sure if it was a salt/spice mix they put on the pizza or if someone accidentally dumped some salt on it in the kitchen, but something was not totally right.  The pros: This restaurant is BEAUTIFUL. A majority of the fixtures are hand made by the glass blowing studio next door and everything is very natural, similar to Burntwood, lots of wood and concrete. The bar wraps around to the outdoor patio where there is additional seating, and I can say with certainty I know this will be the hot spot in Chagrin this coming summer. Also a great idea for a date night :) It's a local business and I really appreciate how much time and money they have put into the area recently. With several Burntwood locations, and 2 more restaurants rumored to be popping up in Solon soon, they are expanding quickly. We met the owner on opening day and he was a very genuine guy who loves what he does. I'm excited to see what the next few years will bring for this company!"}
{"text":"The M pasta is my favorite.  Their \"Zoodles\" Zucchini noodles are really good.  Our best experiences have been sitting at the bar.  The bar tenders are AWESOME!  Good cocktails too.  The one time we have actually sat at a table, the service was meh and slow.  It was to the point that we almost got up and left while waiting for our waiter to let themselves be known.  We waited a good 10 minutes after being seated to be greeted. They were very nice once we found out we had a wait person.  Just took too long to get service.  It was around 4 and was not busy.  The bar area is pretty awesome with its garage doors and indoor and outdoor sides.  The food is fantastic. The clientele can be a bit entitled but, the staff is great and helpful for the most part."}
{"text":"Quite simply our favorite local hangout!  Fabulous food. Brunch is my personal favorite. Love the pancakes!!! Great bar and unique atmosphere. You won't regret making the choice to go to M."}
{"text":"This place has a really great atmosphere, however finding a parking spot was a pain. The food was just so-so. I had the veggie frites to start and the chopped salad for lunch. The frites were a bit too salty and the chopped salad was pretty sad, made up of mostly romaine. My friend had the tomato mozzarella salad, which looked much better than mine (I had salad envy;) Best thing was the bread, but since I've been taking it easy on carbs, I only indulged in a small piece."}
{"text":"My brother and I had lunch at M Italian. It is a wonderful venue with an industrial/rustic design. There is al fresco dining offered with a large bar that wraps around the restaurant AND outside. Great design. We started with Veggie Frite, fried veggies, with a spicy aioli. Wonderful. My lunch was a wonderful portobello sandwich on house made focaccia bread, the same dough they use for pizzas. The fries that accompanied my lunch were mini shoestring fries, excellent.  My brother had the 1/2 sandwich and salad. He chose the turkey sandwich which was also wonderful.  This place is a winner. Go there!!!"}
{"text":"The worst from start to finish. Group of ten shut aside for two apparent regulars who took our table  for ten and held it for almost an hour while the rest of their party dribbled in.  Not a fun 75th birthday . No stars.   One star just to get a review posted .We will not be back."}
{"text":"First trip we immediately noted that it was very loud inside. They are going to need some sound attenuation. Food was average and an entree was brought out that we did not order. The issue was rectified quickly and the waiter was very good. My pasta dish was described by the staff as \"an explosion of Gorgonzola\" but was not very good. My wife took our daughter there several days later ( for lunch) and several promises of \" 10 more minutes \" turned into a very very long delay in getting the food. When our daughter's pizza came out it was the wrong pizza. The entire meal was comped which was a nice gesture. I believe it's far too early to determine the success here. They are going to have growing pains. But they are off to a very poor start in my opinion."}
{"text":"Our first time in CF. Stopped in the Chagrin River Outfitters fly shop while strolling. Dan, the owner recommended M Italian, a short walk from his shop. Open air tables and some further under cover. Our waiter brought menus, waters, and a small loaf of semolina bread with evoo, parmesan, and balsamic vinegar to dip the delicious bread. Milady ordered a chopped salad and wild mushroom pizza special( 1/2 of each). I ordered a panini with tomato and fresh mozzarella. Her pizza was cooked in a wood-burning brick oven so the crust was crisp and nicely blistered. Great mushroom flavor was enhanced by a fresh dusting of parmesan by our waiter( who was terrific!). My panini was served with a wire basket full of crispy shoestring fries. The bread was nicely toasted and packed with ripe tomato slices, mozzarella, basil, and arugula. Fantastic! No dessert as we had a flight to catch."}
{"text":"Great restaurant in Chagrin Falls!!!  Great bar scene and great food!  Appetizers and drinks are great. We had no reservations on a Saturday and they accommodated us immediately! Amazing staff, everyone is so friendly. If you come I recommend the house pizza as an appetizer, it will feed about three people, also the meatball appetizer it was very good.  We live an hour from here but I would definitely come back as often as possible"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and waiter. Our salads were good but my soup and my husband's chicken sliders were way too salty. I was thinking about giving it another try but other people told me their food was over salted too. Maybe I'll go back just for the salads."}
{"text":"For atmosphere, pizza, pasta, salad and drinks, a four star easy outing in one of the coolest areas of Cleveland!   Kid friendly, great outdoor dining area. Other menu entrees like chicken Marsala three stars but still good   Good service.    We will definitely be back with kids or without."}
{"text":"It was a bit noisy, but the meal was phenomenal! I started with the chopped salad which had a light Italian dressing and was delicious.  Then for the meal I had the Gorgonzola Pork Chop.  Unbelievable!  Big, thick & juicy, just melted in my mouth.  Server was attentive and friendly.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Just super overrated place! Too noisy, loud and waiters don't care to serve. The food is really below par (undercooked pasta, too much grease in the good) for Cleveland area standards (since there are so many chef owned and amazing restaurants in the area )."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant with great decor. Gave us warm bread with olive oil to start with while we waited for our dinner.  I ordered the Antoinette pasta dish, it was good. I was missing ingredients from my dish as well as 3 other people in my group. We were a little disappointed that they couldn't let us know they ingredients were not available.  Other then the missing ingredients, the meal was good and the atmosphere was fun. They have glass work and a marble bar.  I would defiantly try them out again."}
{"text":"My daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed our visit here. Everything was excellent: the delicious food, the rustic decor and the attentive service. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Overall: A very nice looking new restaurant in Chagrin Falls.  They shouldn't pre-make their drinks like a college bar.  Drinks: 2 stars.  We got drinks (Moscow Mule, margarita, wine, coffee).  The Moscow Mule was pre-made and poured out of a plastic pitcher.  For a $9 drink at a nice restaurant, it should be made per order.  Appearance: 5 stars.  Excellent decor.  I loved how the walls opened to the outside in nice weather.  The attached glass blowing area was unique.  Service: 4 stars.  No issues.  The bartender was quick.  Price: 3 stars.  On the pricey side for drinks, but appropriate for the type of restaurant in Chagrin Falls."}
{"text":"Second time dining there.It was a rainy night on Saturday. Most of the tables were filled.We sat at the bar.Ordered wedding soup only.wasn't very hungry. Soup came out & was cold."}
{"text":"The food, atmosphere and service here are excellent.  There are many choices for appetizers and main courses as well as items for kids and food critics in the family.  Bret Adams has done an incredible job of transforming what was a vacant and worn out space into a vibrant and architecturally interesting gathering place.  Lastly, their brunch is amazing and a great place to get large groups together."}
{"text":"Simply loved this place. Went here for a business dinner, they were very accommodating to our reservation and service was excellent. The atmosphere is really enjoyable too - we sat on the enclosed patio space. It's not warm enough yet to truly have it as an open patio. I had the lasagna - not too cheesy, not too saucy - just right! I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"We had dinner there.  Food was okay but service was slow. We sat for a while with no water or drinks, then everything came at once in a hurry. Valet parking was confusing and slow. Parking  attendants were not present or helpful. We tried to visit the glass  blowing but they were having a \"private event\" which was not well marked and we got kicked out.  The whole evening left a bad taste and we will never return."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere but it can be a little hard to get in.  Expect a long wait even on weekdays.  Think ahead and make a reservation ahead of time.  The wedge sale is awesome and I spent the rest of the night thinking about it.  The prosciutto wrapped shrimp was more \"ehhhh.\"  I wasn't a winner or a dud.  I feel like they should have seared the shrimp better and got rid of the random serving of beans beneath the dish.  Overall I really like this place and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Fair at best. The decor is great, although the Burntwood people need to understand one thing..SOUND! The restaurants may look nice,but they are way too loud. The food was mediocre at best. How about some better food?"}
{"text":"Eggplant Parmesan to die for! Meat Stromboli pizza outstanding! Sausage and chicken diavolo spicy. Good, but not as good as eggplant or Stromboli. Sicilian mule great drink."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try this place! Loved the atmosphere and loved the outdoor patio. We went on a Sunday and sat at the bar. The lunch menu offered wood fired pizzas, salads, apps and pastas. I ordered a Bellini and was disappointed when it arrived and it was a less then par slushy if you will. My husband ordered a negroni which was very good. Complete opposite in a crafted cocktail. We ordered appetizers- prosciutto wrap shrimp over white beans and arugula. Excellent. Beef carpaccio was excellent in taste and presentation but had a little too much lemon aioli sauce which took away from the carpaccio. We ordered tomato mozzarella as well which was fresh and delicious. Overall we had a great experience. The bartender who was our server could have been a bit more friendly, but answered any questions we had about the food. We will definitely be returning and trying it for dinner!"}
{"text":"Just go to Burntwood Tavern (related entity) where the food is just as good and service is far better. I've eaten here twice and have not been impressed either time. We entered a few weeks ago during a moderately busy time but didn't have to wait for a table. However, once seated we waited for at least 10 minutes without a server. I had to go back up to the hostess station to ask \"Do we have a server?\" No one knew who it was supposed to be so we waited another 5 minutes for someone to show up. We were almost ready to leave when a guy finally came to our table. Minimal apologies just a typical introduction.   On to the meal. We took a few minutes and then ordered food and also wine. It took our server far too long to bring out drinks as I watched him schmoozing with a group of customers at the bar for a while.   Food was decent. Pasta with meatballs was quite good. Kids enjoyed their meals.   I place a premium on decent (not even great) service and M Italian has failed there both visits."}
{"text":"Eeeeeeehhhhh..... No words, just sounds of pain. Olive Garden is better than this place. Ended up eating at the bar where the poor bartender was so clearly overwhelmed and understaffed. Unfortunately that translated into a VERY VERY poor attitude. My dad and I didn't even want the tip to go to him, rather split by the three other servers we bothered because we couldn't get any service from the bartender.   This restaurant group needs to get it together essentially. Go to the Crumb and Spigot if you want good bar service with a delicious brick oven pizza. I don't foresee spending my money here again, though it has been a few weeks so hopefully things have settled."}
{"text":"Don't really get it. Great atmosphere but Parmesan chicken salad was not good at all. Like unto airport food. Pizza was okay. Price does not match quality. Other restaurants within this group are good."}
{"text":"Can we add a few more stars here???  This place has quickly become one of our favorite spots.  Owned by the same folks that own Burntwood Tavern (which we do not care for), this place just has a special vibe with distressed beams, a huge patio that they enclose and still use during the winter.  Food???  We've never had a bad meal.  Great selection of beer, wine and liquor.  Very nice prosecco bubbly.  Hmmm... special vibe... great food... prosecco... perhaps you're seeing a pattern here?  Yeah... we really dig this place.  Want more?  Charlene, Heather, Jarod, Lauren and Elizabeth all tend a mean bar. Be sure to visit the \"Glass Asylum\" that shares the building.  Oh, yeah, don't forget... it's Chagrin Falls.  Check out the Falls.  Buy some fresh popcorn.  But just make sure to include M Italian as part of your Itinerary.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite. Pizza had no flavor - tasted like Hunts tomato sauce with cheese. Others at table agreed. Their pizzas had no taste either even with toppings. It is a trendy place and prices are reasonable but don't come here for the pizza.  Service was good once our server finally came to the table."}
{"text":"The decor makes this restaurant beautiful.  Had a party of 12 and was seated inside although they did have the patio and garage type doors open since it was such a nice day.  The place looks like a barn and was very rustic inside, I loved it.  We got arancini as an appetizer and it was pretty good.  The bread is AMAZING.  Also split wedding soup and a wedge salad with someone.  Both were very good.  As an entree, I got the shrimp risotto.  Was very full from the apps but what I did eat was delicious.  Also tried a piece of the 4 cheese pizza which I didn't love (I'm not a huge ricotta fan though!).  The rest of the pizzas looked very good and I will get one when I go back.  The rest of my table got the M Pasta, lasagna, burgers, and chicken marsala.  The two lasagna dinners looked completely different which was strange but no one complained about their food.  The service was so slow.  Like ridiculously slow.  I didn't get a cup for water and when I asked for one it took a while to get it.  Boxing up food took entirely too long.  Everyone seemed to be rushing around and overwhelmed but the restaurant was not that crowded, many many open tables.  The tables were also super close together and I kept bumping into the table behind me.  They were very accommodating for the two children at our table.  I will go back and they have happy hour 7 days a week with 7$ pizzas..woo! And complementary valet!"}
{"text":"*UPDATED* First off, I absolutely love the design and aesthetics of M Italian. But I don't go to restaurants based on how they look from the outside. I also should mention that I had excellent service there on essentially every occasion that I went. After a few of my early visits, they earned a strong 4, but I recently updated this review.  So here's the deal...I've tried numerous dishes here, the best thing I've had is the meatball sub, the calzone was a close second. The \"wedding soup\" was pretty good, and I've enjoyed the pizza there as well on a few occasions. Unfortunately, the pasta there has been lackluster to me (with the exception of the lasagne, which was decent), so I stopped trying it. It was always a little dense/heavy, which some people may prefer...but isn't really how I like my pasta. Regardless...  Over the time I spent in Cleveland, I truly enjoyed having M Italian as an option. It was without question, one of my favorite restaurants. From a 4 to a 5!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I go here quite often since it is close to home. It is very cool atmosphere since it use to be an old auto dealership. They have a garage door made of glass to be open during warmer months and attached is a glass blowing place. They also incorporated glass in the large chandeliers and the amazing pendants over the bar.   Even though M Italian is a change and I go to this and Burntwood too much for my own good, it doesn't feel like the change. The food is good (especially the pork) and it's just a fun and tasty date place or family dinner.   The food is good and sometimes it's especially delicious, but we have had over cooked bread a couple times and their cheese pizza my fiancé ordered was too flimsy with way too much different cheese texture on it. However, I got the mushroom and arugula pizza with no cheese and they cook it in this big stone oven and it was amazing!   Bottom line, it's good food at a good price in a fun atmosphere in the center of chagrin falls."}
{"text":"Wow. Made a short trip to Ohio with my daughter and wanted to take her to a \"New York\" type place with a vibe and energy. We found that, and more, at M Italian with the added bonus of amazing food, amazing drinks, incredible service staff and the bonus - a great happy hour. I can't recommend this place more. It felt like the hot spot in the Hamptons sans the price tag and wait to get in. We went for happy hour. This was one of the best happy hours. Awesome wines and cocktails and a 4 cheese pizza better than anything we have had in NY. All the food was amazing. Staff incredible. Sat outside and loved the ambiance. So relaxed but so cool. So easy. Valet parking and no wait for a table with a reservation!  Andrew, the bar manager, was a gentleman and we really enjoyed talking to him (and learning he lived blocks away from my daughter in NY). I could go on all night. Just can't wait to get back to M Italian. Loved it!  Great job M Italian! You made our trip to Ohio!"}
{"text":"A group of us came here two nights ago for drinks and dinner...I have never encountered a place where the staff is so rude.  First, the hostess was nasty.  You cannot have a good service experience if the first person you encounter is rolling her eyes and cannot seem to stop her nose from scraping against the ceiling.  No greeting, no smile, nothing.  She looked like a zombie. Secondly, the server was okay.  Flustered and curt, however, she was overworked, so we tipped well. Thirdly, the food: I had calamari and it was disgustingly salty.  The marinara accompanying it was cold and also tasted like a salt lick.  No one was impressed by the food, at all; you would do better eating Stouffer's from your local grocer.  It takes a special skill set to be able to screw up a deep fried appetizer. We were eager to try this place and we were prepared to drop a considerable amount of money on alcohol and apps...needless to say, we were unimpressed.  I was unaware that Italian food could be this gross."}
{"text":"I can see why people may not like this place. The ambiance is gorgeous and I love the overall vibe. Its enjoyable to watch the people next door blowing glass while you chat. Very entertaining and enticing. However, its the typical stuck up, holier than thou chagrin falls crowd which ruins it. I came today for brunch with my fiancé and the girl at the hostess stand was certainly not the sharpest tool in the shed and may have assumed I was deaf because I couldn't hear word she said without reading her lips.   The service is standard, nothing to write home about at all. The food was very good. I ordered a peach Bellini which came out in a large wine glass as a frozen slushee? Surprisingly refreshing but not advertised as such. My fiancé had the pear of cucs and enjoyed it. For food I had the mushroom pizza without cheese and he had the margarita. My pizza was absolutely phenomenal. It could not have been better. My fiancé's was soggy and soft in the middle and cut in 5 different slice sizes ranging from very small triangle to large square.   All in all the food was very good. The experience itself can easily be heightened with better and more cheerful attentive service. Will be back for the pizza and the fantastic brunch menu."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday dinner with my husband and three year old daughter.  Overall it was sub par Italian food.  Not bad necessarily, but not good either.    I got the calamari, chicken parmigiana, and a dark n stormy.  I felt that the drink was watered down, the calamari was unseasoned, and the chicken parm was fine.... just not seasoned.  I think bland would be the word  that I would use to describe the experience.  We won't be going back voluntarily.  Not worth the money.  Higher quality ingredients than olive garden, but the chefs are just missing something when it comes to how flavors and textures go together."}
{"text":"My wife, mother in law, and I went here for our 1st wedding anniversary.  Also our first time at this restaurant,  To say we were pleasantly surprised is an understatement.  My MIL is 88 years old and the valet held an umbrella for her and my wife (it was raining) as they walked to the entrance.  We were greeted promptly and put at a nice table on the patio next to the fire place.  Our waiter was Steph and he was excellent.  He took his time with us, got our drink orders-coffee and 2 glasses of wine.  When he returned, he got our appetizer order (MIL had the Lobster Bisque, I had the arugula and pear salad, both of which were very good).  Steph then got our dinner orders, Chicken Marsala for me, the Salmon salad for my wife, and MIL got the Pasta M.  All of the meals were excellent.  When dinner arrived, Bob, the manager, came over to check on us.  He came back a second time when we were done just to make sure all was good.  Bob recognizes what a great team he has and talked them up when we spoke to him the second time.  The staff was excellent, the food was great, and the atmosphere was exactly what we were looking for.  MIL is already talking about going back."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful. I was surprised they had a wait on a Wednesday night so I would suggest a reservation. The drink menu was amazing and they have happy house from 3pm - 6pm. I had my first ever Sicilian Mule, blew me away. Then I ordered a Carbonara and a House salad. Both perfectly made and so fresh. The Carbonara was perfectly creamy without adding cream. Great hidden gem. Even in the winter, we sat in the patio area and it was very warm and inviting."}
{"text":"We went here for my Dad's birthday.  This was our first time here.  Everything was wonderful. With reservations, we were seated right on time.  The drinks and food were outstanding.  I ordered the Sicilian Mule and it may be one of my favorite drinks.  Our waiter was very attentive and made sure everything was good.  They even offered us a free champagne toast for the birthday celebration.  We brought my 3 month old with us and they were accommodating in getting us a carrier.  He loved looking at the beautiful lighting.  Looking forward to another trip back here!"}
{"text":"A terrible disappointment.  I have tried many times to like this place. I was in the restaurant yesterday and had the most horrible service. There were only 6 tables with patrons in the restaurant and our waitress was so rude.  She was short and very put off that we were there from the moment we sat down. Two of us at the table had lipstick marks on our wine glasses but we were AFRAID to tell our waitress. Every time we asked for something that we felt was simple, like ice for the water, she would rudely  reply, \" It will be a few minutes.\"  She didn't offer cheese for our pasta or to go boxes for our half eaten meals. She didn't come to the table to check on us or see if we wanted anything more. We had to flag her down for more drinks. I will not return. The food was okay but the service made the meal awful."}
{"text":"Here looking for brunch! I ordered the Crabcake Eggs Benedict. The presentation was awesome! Looked good, smelled good and the fruit bowl it came with added that color to the plate! One of the main reasons I typically order Eggs Benedict is the hollandaise sauce. Not sure if it was called for in this iteration of the dish but either way it didn't taste like it was in there. The zucchini hash didn't have as much flavor as I anticipated as well.   All good though! I'm guessing the real charm shines through in the normal menu as it did look like there were plenty of delicious options. The atmosphere was very chic Italian. Patio offered a friendly view of the Chagrin Fall neighborhood. There was a cozy little patio furniture section surrounding a fire pit in the middle of that patio. Friendly staff and an atmosphere that I'm presuming is awesome in the evenings!"}
{"text":"The food here is awesome! We've had great meals for brunch and lunch. The atmosphere is good as well. We enjoy sitting at the bar or the enclosed/outdoor space...it's a little brighter. The bar staff leaves a little to be desired. They're friendly, but just need to be a little more on top of their game."}
{"text":"Great alternative to going to burntwood again and again. Loved the open air dining. We were brought a welcome shot as it was our first time dining there which was a lovely touch. But our waitress was awful. I had to flag someone down to get a drink after being seated and ignored. She brought out the wrong order and seemed to blame us for her misunderstanding our order.  We were a group of four women and she brought us one check. When we asked for our own checks she split the bill down the middle.  Some of us had one drink, some two, some considerably more expensive meals than others. It was completely inappropriate for her to first of all assume we wanted one bill and secondly to split it down the middle.  She then changed one credit card twice and another not at all and when the mistake was brought to her attention she was not apologetic nor did she assume any responsibility. The food was decent, nothing extremely special and after our service my return is questionable."}
{"text":"It's all smoke and mirrors... Stay away. Second time out here, I gave it a second chance and it's a loser both times. Had the calamari which was ok not special. Fried vegetables soggy, penne pasta pretty basic, pizza is like chain style. Nothing special here, just hustle and bustle... Too bad it looks great. The crazy part is that we had s reservation both times and waited over 30 mins after reservation time. We requested outside seating, we didn't get it though a table was ready. We were punished because my wife wasn't happy for the fact that our table wasn't ready as per our reservation. We overheard the hostess mock my wife over the reservation.  It will probably do ok, CF needs restaurants. Jekylls is back... Go there first."}
{"text":"Do not go till M Italian if you want to keep your hearing. It is so loud  with everyone there screaming it is the most unpleasant venue anywhere.  We got our car from valet and went to the Paris Room. It was wonderful. Question?  Why does everyone at a table for twenty women need to wail all night?"}
{"text":"Great happy hour from 3-6.  Enjoyed sitting outside on their covered patio during a sunny afternoon early in the week. Wide variety of drinks, appetizers, and pizzas for a happy hour menu."}
{"text":"Great food and service! My family and I ate here several times over the Memorial Day weekend and really enjoyed the food and outdoor seating.  Great salads, (strawberry arugula amazing), House salad great, chicken salad great, pizzas and meatballs great, calamari great too.  Service was good, they were very busy but still did a great job."}
{"text":"This review is going to be based solely on the food as I didn't eat in the restaurant (ate next door after glass blowing)  I enjoyed a wonderful meal at M Italian. It's hard for me to go out and eat Italian as my boyfriends mother is from Italy and makes homemade everything but I'm sure glad we ate here. First they bring out the most doughy perfectly seasoned bread with olive oil to dip. I had to use some self control not to eat it all and share. I started off with the arugula and pear salad topped with a fresh lemon vinaigrette and pine nuts. (I don't really like cheese so I opted for no feta) The salad was absolutely out of this world. The only thing I wish there was more of is pear. It was everything fresh as light, to bitter to sweet. The salad was literally perfect. I decided on the Spicy Sicilian wood-fired pizza for my entree (so I can take half home for later) and was super happy that I did. The fresh sausage and pepperoni was delish with the softness of the ricotta. I love spice and the peppers spiced it up perfectly. I also enjoyed that the crust was thicker than a typical wood-fired pizza.   I will be back again and will tell others about this place as well. Other people at my table got scallops, zucchini pasta and pumpkin sage raviolis... no one had to go boxes so you know everything was good."}
{"text":"While I appreciate the Chef Art Pour group and what they have accomplished in Cleveland, I have to say that our second visit to M was definitely not as good as the first. It was a beautiful night in Chagrin Falls and we were excited to share our family experience with M. Unfortunately, tonight, the server seemed more interested in the Michigan State / Notre Dame football game.    No dishes were cleared between courses and we had to ask for simple things like water. The food was acceptable but exceptional. I think it's time for a break."}
{"text":"Great food, great service but the noise level in the main dining room had our party of 4 almost yelling do we could hear each other.  Love this place but wish they had put wood floors in to absorb some of the noise."}
{"text":"The Farmhouse pizza ($14 for 8 pieces) is tasty along with Pinot Grizzio(sp)wine. The decor is clean & simple with a large glass chandelier (probably made at the glass place next door). Service is courteous and prompt. Holly"}
{"text":"Beautiful environment here. We went during happy hour on a Saturday. $6 cocktails, $6 wines and $7 pizzas! We ordered two drinks and split a pizza and Stromboli. The Stromboli was AWESOME. Pizza was good but not best ever. It was weird that the food came out about 5 minutes apart from each other. Waitress seemed confused, maybe not the best communication here. Other waitress was fun! Overall, 4/5."}
{"text":"Ok....so the first time we came it was great. Really busy but excellent service. Tonight (2nd time). Ordered exact same meal....half the size.  Sent back as I politely complained. Looks like all around from talking with other patrons that things can be inconsistent. I will however return"}
{"text":"We went out for a company christmas party last year to M Italian, food was good. However, my girlfriend was puking 7-8 hours after and myself 8-9 hours later. Not even a Zofran, pharmaceutical grade anti-nausea could stop the issue. While this was concerning in and of itself. What really bothers me and left the bad taste in my mouth was the fact that upon exiting the establishment, the valet notified my coworker of a problem with her car door.  Upon inspection the door would not fully close, it was clear and apparent it was recklessly backed into either another car or something with the door open. The valet admitted fault and then when was called about the matter \"pretended\" that the car came this way.  This issue should have been resolved with insurance, but because of the valets $5,000 deductible they offered nothing. This is Chagrin falls, no one is driving with a door unable to close. What has bothered me is to this day it is now a YEAR later and has still not been resolved, meanwhile a friend experienced the EXACT same issue this past weekend.      Make good on this, drop your valet, help your patrons or become the next Gamekeepers."}
{"text":"My most favorite place to dine with family and friends in all of Ohio so far. This restaurant is gorgeous, clean and the food is spectacular. It would also be a great place to have a party, or a rehearsal dinner!"}
{"text":"This was one of the best meals I have had in a long time. We started with a pizza- the balsamic. It had a perfect sauce, sliced chicken and I believe gorgonzola cheese. We all commented on how it was one of the best pizzas we've tasted. Excellent balance in flavors.  We ordered a couple of salads as well. A wedge salad and house. Both salads were presented beautifully and dressed well. So many restaurants offer a basic house salad, but this was anything but. Pancetta, gorgonzola and sweet and sour dressing. We really enjoyed the bread and olive oil dipping sauce  By this point, we were quite full but looking forward to our dinners. Dad is pretty picky about pasta, especially cream sauces, but he loved his Carbonara. The sauce was a good consistency, noodles cooked al dente and drained well (that's another qualification on Dad's radar) and the peas were a great addition.  I really enjoyed my Pasta Antoinette with artichokes and spinach. This was so perfectly prepared and every element of the dish was able to stand out. It wasn't drowning in sauce and although I wasn't hungry I ate my leftovers as soon as I got home.  Our server was Kiara and she was wonderful. Very attentive and friendly. For 3 iced teas, pizza, 2 salads, and 2 entrees our bill was $60. I found it very reasonable.   Chagrin Falls isn't near my home at all, but this restaurant is worth the drive. I cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"The restaurant is very very nice. Really cool glass blowing shop connected to restaurant. Food is ok Nothing great. Went few more times food not improved. To bad cause it is great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Our first night out in Chagrin Falls and we decided to try out M Italian because we had heard great things. It did not disappoint. The food was amazing, the people even better. We sat closer to the kitchen and the Chef, Eric, was so nice to us. I had a question about a menu item and he was very accommodating. He noticed my wife was pregnant and brought out a complimentary chocolate dessert. We even ordered a pizza to go just to have it for the next day at home. Amazing experience and we will be back for constant date nights at M Italian!"}
{"text":"Didn't eat a full meal here, but stopped in for a drink and treat after some shopping.  Amazing atmosphere and space; drinks were good and the salad we ordered at the bar were great!  Everyone else's food looked delicious and we cannot wait to eat a full dinner here!"}
{"text":"M Italian fits right in with the idyllic small town of chagrin falls. I think I have found my favorite pizza here with the mushroom pizza. The earthiness of the mushrooms and along with the Onions was delicious. Happy to say the service matched the food."}
{"text":"So I won a gift card to M Italian during Chagrin Valley Restaurant Week! Pretty exciting for me because M had been on my list of places to try. So I, along with my Husband and my Mom, gave it a whirl yesterday!   We arrived a few minutes early for our 6pm reservations and were seated right away by the welcoming hostess. Our server immediately followed with some awesome bread & oil and she took our drink orders.  To start, we shared the beef carpaccio appetizer...DELISH!  The caper berries were a nice touch! For my meal I opted for a Caesar salad and the M Pasta. My husband got the chopped salad and Spaghetti Bolognese while Mom ordered their Grouper special. Everything I had was fantastic!  I especially enjoyed my M Pasta!  I think that was probably the best meatball I've ever had!  Flavorful, loosely packed...just yum!  I tried some of the husband's Bolognese and found it to be quite nice!  (Although I enjoyed the spice of my M Pasta sauce more!) Mom said her Grouper was a little salty. But that was the only complaint about any part of our meals!  For dessert we split a humongous slice of tiramisu!  I'm not much of a dessert eater but I can't pass up tiramisu!  Whoa!  This was quite possibly the best I've tasted!     Our entire experience was fantastic!  Fast, friendly service combined with delicious food!  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had heard mixed reviews so wanted to try M. We went for Happy Hour on a weeknight. Our server was very good and attentive. Having been to a lot of happy hours in the area with lots of food choices we were disappointed that only wood-fired flat bread pizzas were on the menu. (Regular menu is available.)  The wine selection was okay. The beer selection had none of the Cleveland brews, and did include Peroni. We had to ask for the heaters to be turned on, being chilly in the plastic covered patio. Interesting use of the same space for summer and winter. Check it out."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Called a week ahead for reservations for 5 adults and ended up with a booth and chair at the end in the aisle. For first time visit, which we told the waitress who had an attitude, was unhelpful and at times rude. Out of 5 meals only 1 was good. On Saturday nite at 6:30 they ran out of desserts that we were offered. Service was sub-par at best. So loud we couldn't hear each other talk. Not a relaxing experience at all! Will not go back!     Kim P."}
{"text":"The service was startling awful! Even following complaining multiple times we could barely get a drink or any service at all. The floor is so slippery that I'm sure they are out of ADA compliance. Waiters and waitresses told us that they had slipped many times and the bs manager came over to me following a fall trying to make excuses. It may be the worst meal and restaurant I've eaten at in Cleveland,"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a colleague before heading to the airport for my flight home.  Good choice.  Nice sized, roomy restaurant with an open outside seating area.  It was such a nice day we chose the outside area.  The service was attentive and friendly.    We both had personal pizzas, mine was the margherita pizza.  Before the pies came out we received a large bread for the table.  The bread was delicious.  It had the consistency of pretzel dough.  I loved it.  The pizza was very good.  It was cut into small slices and had the same dough as the bread.  Lightly salted as well, and with a nice sauce to cheese ratio.  It isn't NYC pizza for sure, but I would definitely return if business brought me back."}
{"text":"From the same owners of Burntwood Tavern, this Italian restaurant fits perfectly in chagrin falls. The food never disappoints, and the atmosphere is so nice for a dinner with friends or family. In the summer, the restaurant opens and entire wall to the outdoor patio. Next door, there is a place called the Glass Asylum where you can watch (or participate!) in blowing custom glass pieces (the awesome chandelier in M Italian was made by these artists). My favorite dish is honestly their margarita pizza with a bottle of Chianti. They also have really good calamari!"}
{"text":"Hot inside - they need some fans or AC. Meatball app was really good. Calamari app was good too but NOT plentiful. Salmon entree? BORING! Bland and blah. Several of us had it and agreed. Those who had the steak said it was good. Limited entree menu OTHER than pastas. Would not probably go back by choice, thought it was beautiful (modern and trendy) atmosphere-wise. Service was attentive!"}
{"text":"Went here last night after glass blowing next door. We had such a lovely meal here last night with the whole family. The service was excellent. I highly recommend the scallop and portobello risotto. My mother ordered the eggplant Parmesan which is new to the menu and it was outstanding. If you have a Burntwood loyalty card present it to the server as it is accepted."}
