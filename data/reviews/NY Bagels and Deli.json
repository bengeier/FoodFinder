{"text":"These are definitely the best Bagels in Arizona. I haven't been able to find a good NY bagel for awhile. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!!!  Wow, my son and I had Italian Subs.  The bread was PERFECT!  It reminded very much of the subs I would get when I lived in Chicago (take that as a huge compliment).  The sandwich was very large so easy to split unless you have a huge appetite or can't control yourself around yummy food.  I can't wait to go back and try some more there.  The only reason I didn't give them a 5 is that maybe some fresh made chips would send it to the 5 star rating other than that...yummmmy!"}
{"text":"This place is right across the street from my work. All the meat used here is Boars head.  The place looks really clean and smells delicious!  I asked the owner what his reccomendation was and he mentioned the Philly Cheese Steak. I really liked it. This place also has several breakfast bagels that look amazing."}
{"text":"bagels are pretty good considering there aren't any rel bagel shops out in the valley.  the service here is TERRIBLE!!  Can;t get orders right, can't get people moving in and out of the shop....I stopped coming to this place for a year and sad I came back the 2 times I did to try and give them another shot.  Even worse."}
{"text":"I have never had bagels this good outside of New York City! The rest of their deli is amazing also. Great family-run spot I was so pleased to find when we opened our business in the Deer Valley Airpark! They bake their own bagels as well as the french rolls. Delicious!"}
{"text":"In a word, disappointing. I was last here a couple of years ago and was surprised at how it's changed. Drab, uninviting ambience and the food we had was awful. Cake-like croissants, undercooked eggs, and luke-warm coffee which was re-heated in the micro with a scowl. Not a single smile from behind the counter in all the time we were there. I like a little sunshine with my breakfast!"}
{"text":"I work close to these guys and love love love their bagels but their customer service holds me back from coming in more. They're very bland, and at times kind of intimidating and rude."}
{"text":"I've been coming to N.Y bagels for 3 weeks now and I have to say this place is A great place to sit and enjoy a breakfast meal or even lunch .The bagels are baked fresh daily and cream cheese is made to perfection .Some of the best cream cheese i've ever had .They have Lounge area where you can sit on sofas and enjoy eating your bagel breakfast burrito or sandwich while You are Checking emails social media are just wanna sit and relax ."}
{"text":"Had a breakfast bagel and was really pleased with service and food. Eggs were made fresh right in front of you."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years. Favorite bagel sandwiches. Super friendly and nice owners. Highly recommend. Need to also try them for breakfast soon."}
{"text":"IT was ok - the bagel wasn't that fresh, and they were very slow.  They didn't have much of a selection for bagels.  I will continue to stick with Hot Bagels, much better bagels."}
{"text":"I love NY Bagels! I eat breakfast here at least twice a week, and often get bagels for the family on the weekends. $5 for a sandwich and a drink, and you're full! And the family that runs it is great. 

So if you want something cheap, go to McDonald's and eat off the value menu. If you want something filling and tasty, go to NY Bagels. You'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Direct and to the point the food is great and the price is right.  If you love a good Ruben this place has one that melts in your mouth. If you love Turkey you have to try the cracked pepper Turkey. (Order it hot). Portions are not too big nor too small. Boars head meats!"}
{"text":"This place better every time I go there. I work just a few blocks away and have been on the hunt for smaller independent eateries. I ate here the first time and they were out of bagels so I got a sandwich on regular bread, which was alright, but I'm glad I gave it a second chance. The bagels are the best I've had, better than Chompies even. They use all boars head meats and other fresh ingredients. For lunch $7 (after tax!) buys you a sandwich, chips and a drink. 

Down side, polystyrene drink cups. Also the building makes it not overly obvious that it's a restaurant."}
{"text":"Great bagels, great sandwiches (Boars Head),  for a great price. Plus they deliver. I can't ask for much more."}
{"text":"Nice environment, not too small or crowded but did not live up to the hype I read about on here. Granted I had only gotten an everything bagel with veggie cream cheese so I can only go off of that. Bagel was good, average not spectacular. Cream cheese was quite disappointing to say the least. It was thin, watery and had no flavor at all. It seemed like they had mixed cottage cheese into it or maybe it was all cottage cheese and no cream cheese at all. Not sure what vegetable was chopped into it, but again, not flavorful at all. I  like my bagels warm and soft with cream cheese having a mouthful of flavor. Sadly, this wasn't it :( Einstein bagel is almost better for a regular bagel with cream cheese."}
{"text":"I was craving breakfast, we were outta eggs, and I've heard some good things about this place, so here goes:

It's strange that a place this good is in such a weird area (I actually had to map it; it's almost a blink-and-you'll-miss-it kinda place). It's like their real estate agent played a trick on them or something. I'm forever grateful for amazing little spots like this living in the meth-y part of Deer Valley as I do. Having only been here on the weekend so far maybe I'm wrong, but it wasn't too busy and that's a shame since their product is so good.

These are some TASTY bagels! Crisp out the outside (especially crispy after toasting) and soft and chewy inside, really perfect all around. I ordered an Everything Bagel with egg and bacon and it really did me in, all lip-smackin' and teeth pickin'. I see that some other reviewers are fond of buying a dozen or so and stocking up their freezers, which is an excellent idea. I also ordered a coffee and it was FREE because it was before 11am and I was buying a sandwich. Awesome deal!

I would dish out 5 stars if they had a full-on barista instead of the Farmer Bros. pump action coffee, but hey, nobody's perfect."}
{"text":"This place has THE best bagels! THE best! My hubby and I go here probably 3 times a week (combined). We honestly can't go anywhere else in the valley. Einsteins, Chompies, The Best Bagels, Hot Bagels,..just don't compare. If we are on other side of town, we will actually make the drive. We are just disappointed if we go anywhere else for a bagel. The bagels are firm but still chewy enough. Their everything bagel toasted with cream cheese is my go-to. It has the toppings on both sides of the bagel. Hubby also gets the bagel egg sandwich. Also delicious. The place is family owned and ran. You'll see the same faces working everyday. The place is no frills, clean. Choice of beverages, hot coffee, few different creamer flavors. We love this place!"}
{"text":"Listen, if this place was a tad cleaner I would have given it 5 Stars! It's not nasty, but it could be cleaner. The bagels are delicious, as are all the pastries I tried there. All the Danishes were excellent, as was their Croissant Donuts; never seen one, had 3 of them while I was there! Other donuts available. Young man working the counter was very polite, and always wore gloves. I'm originally from NY, living in NC now, and these bagels are as good as the ones I grew up on Long Island enjoying. Their coffee is delicious, but the milk and cream area needs to be cleaned more often. Area where the tables are needs a little cleaning up, but not a deal breaker.
I would go back, I hope they just clean up a little, in the long run they will make more money!"}
{"text":"Rueben on Sourdough (Great) with standard chips and soda. Tasty place - i'd come back!"}
{"text":"Family owned business with some fantastic NY style bagels! They are the old time hand rolled, boiled then baked bagels. They are ALWAYS fresh and tasty. If you don't go you will be doing yourself an injustice...."}
{"text":"The bagel and meat quality is excellent. The bagels taste just like the bagels in ny and they use all boars head meats. all the ingredients seem very fresh, my lettuce has never been wilted and tomatoes are always crisp. This is the first deli I've been to in Phoenix that really reminds me of New York, even the staff. By the time afternoon hits most of my favorite bagels are usually cleared it out so if you want a wide selection I would suggest coming in the morning. There is a large lunch crowd so if you decide to come during that time expect a 10/15 minute wait. 



Be aware that they are nestled in The corner of a    warehouse/industrial type area so it's not the easiest place to find."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast today. Got the plain bagel with plain cream cheese and breakfast burrito with sausage. Have to say that I'm not impressed and the burro was very very bland. I give this place a \"meh\"."}
{"text":"Loved the food.  Glad that I found this place.  Nothing fancy, just great taste."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Ordered bagel sandwich with lox. Got one with ham. Sandwich wasn't good or bad just nothing special. Ham was so thin I couldn't taste it. Ended up going to the grocery store and buying bagels and lox."}
{"text":"I came for lunch, ordered cold corn beef on rye with a side of chips.

Quick service, about 15 other people in the restaurant dining or eating.

The food was good, tasty rye and corned beef.  Only thing keeping me from 5 star rating was the size of the sandwich.  The corned beef I'm used to at delis is usually 4-6\" thick with heaping mounds of beef.  This sandwich wasn't skimpy just not the hulking deli sandwiches I'm used to."}
{"text":"Nice and quiet yet hard to find.  The service was quick but the lady at the counter wasn't very friendly. I told her I've never been here before and her response was what do you want! I ordered a bacon egg & cheese bagel....Although I only wanted the sandwich the lady insisted it came with coffee or a soda.....which she forgot to give to me! It's early and it's sat so I'll give her the benefit of doubt. Overall the food was good! $5.15 not a bad price!"}
{"text":"Wow!! This place is the real deal. The bagels are huge and fresh and soft with a ton of toppings on them. I was craving a bagel sandwich and I stumbled upon this place. I will never buy any other bagel sandwich now. The bagels are fresh, the meat and cheese are boars head and they give you chips and a drink with it for cheap! I love supporting small business and this place deserves a ton of credit!"}

Absolute great bagels, the kind you can really just eat without anything on.  Fantastic selection of stuff to put on the bagels including Boarshead meats and a variety of cream cheeses. 

We routinely get NY Bagels at work with many different types of cream cheese, and then I come here a lot for the Nova Lox bagel.  

Place is clean, selection of bagels is great, although I wish there was a wholegrain. 
They do have
Jalapeno
Spinach
Egg
Everything
Raisin

as well as normal selection

Plenty of seating, staff are friendly and free wifi."}
{"text":"This place is awful, and service was beyond EXTREMELY slow and unorganized. They had the cashier touch my food, after handling money. Had no gloves. Very unsanitary. I recommend Einstein bagels for ideal service and food. I will never go back here, the ownership is so poor."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and I think merits 5 stars. Having grown up in Arizona, I think this might have been the best bagel I've ever had in my life. I got the egg, bacon and cheese sandwich on an Everything bagel and it was HUGE and just perfect. Unlike another reviewer my bacon was hot, and I had no issues with the cleanliness. I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Been here many times and let me tell you, this place is the real deal. Not only am I from New York and already predisposed to good, quality bagels but I also spent 6 years working in a bagel shop as well. The bagels here are always fresh and baked to perfection, as are the sub rolls, which are made in-house. The pricing is fair considering that they use high quality meats provided by Boar's Head and the service is always fast and friendly. Definitely a must try for the true bagel lover."}
{"text":"I was in a dire need of a bagel breakfast sandwich. I love that when I ordered, I got to order what ever the f*ck I wanted. Total customizable. I got a plain bagel toasted with cream cheese, egg whites, bacon, and tomatoes. It was on point. Straight up tasted like something I would have made but I didn't actually have to make it. They had a selection of bagels to choose from. I would definitely go back and try one of their flavored bagels."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast or lunch. Nothing fancy, but exactly what I want from a bagel shop. Everything's made to order on a grill in plain sight. Fresh hand rolled bagels, plus Boar's Head meats and cheeses."}
{"text":"Bomb bagel joint, great for a quick breakfast sandwich as long as you can beat the crowd. True east coast quality and entrepreneurship, the fact that they serve boars head meats is just icing on the cake. Haters are gonna hate, why would you complain about a salad that you got from a bagel shop."}
{"text":"Got a couple of toasted bagels and schmear to test the waters. Long story short... I will be back."}
{"text":"Had a hankering for a bagel today (which is pretty uncommon for me) and decided to head up with a couple of fellow workers to this place. Of COURSE the oven was busted and they didn't have any bagels, so I wound up ordering a lox sandwich on rye bread. For some reason they kept calling this a \"nova\", although I just googled \"nova lox sandwich\" and now know why, but I didn't at the time so I was squinting at the menu and confirming that I was actually getting an ELL OH ECKS sandwich. The sandwich was pretty good, but at over seven bucks it was a little pricey - any lunch at that price (including my favourite Fuji Apple Chicken salad at Paradise Bakery) places it into the \"rare treat\" category, especially when you can buy one whopper and get one free @ less than half the price from Burger King these days. And I'm guessing a whopper would be pretty on-par with the Nova sandwich, health-wise. AND I'd have gotten a better sandwich from Miracle Mile for roughly the same price. A-ny-way, good place, but bye bye one star for calling yourselves a bagel deli but not actually having any bagels on the one day of the year that I actually decide to visit. If I ever come back, you might regain the star (assuming your bagels are actually as good as others have observed).

Wonder what that accent is..?"}
{"text":"No real signs to direct people in to the business in the multi-complex. The bagel display is a little confusing. Service became drastically nice when they looked at my phone and saw I was checking in on yelp. Very dark lighting. I don't know how the how people could read a paper in there. To top it off, the bagel wasn't that great. Not worth the trouble of finding."}
{"text":"I love hole in the wall places. This place was so hole in the wall we drove by it twice not realizing it was actually in the industrial park part. I was craving some bagle and lox and this place was closer than driving to Chompies at Paradise Valley Mall. Even though they were out of lox (apparently someone had walked in just after they opend and ordered 13) I did get the BLT on aseago with cream cheese. These are the best bagels I have ever eaten, Hands Down!. I look forward to going back for some lox!"}
{"text":"I just left and ordered a turkey club on a bagel. Really good! I let her make it her way and enjoyed it even with spicy mustard. This thing was huge! I went thinking the bagel would be small, but it was more than I could handle. . They use only boars head, so you know it was a quality sandwich. When in AZ, will definitely pay them a visit!"}
{"text":"Went here in the afternoon on Christmas Eve hoping they were open. Got there just as the owner was walking to the door to close. I said I could go and the owner said \"no, no, no, I'll help you\". I got 2 Italian subs, owner told me they make all breads at the shop and as others said, they use good meat. The sub was stuffed and the bread was soft but with a nice crunch. Sub took a while to make as there is a technique of stuffing it but it was very good. I'll certainly go back. Pricing is fair too; the sub isn't a foot long, perhaps 8-9\" but well stuffed and for 2 subs, 2 drinks, 2 chips and 1 fat deli pickle we paid about $16. Worth the price and the wait. They are only open for breakfast and lunch. I'll def. go again to try breakfast...or for another sub. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Last time I was in here I ordered a Hot Hero Sandwich. I even asked the lady at the counter what was in the Hero sandwich. She explained there was salami, etc, etc. plus a drink for $7. Well she/they couldn't get the order right because out came a Gyro wrap. I say Hero you say Gyro. Well I say let's call the whole thing off. I took the Gyro wrap since I was pressed for time. That was definitely the worst tasting Gyro I have ever had. The meat was burnt at the edges and the wrap had what tasted like a garlic sauce in it. Yuk, I won't return."}
{"text":"I always forget how quality this place is, they use all boars head meats and have an excellent bagel selection.  Their lunch special is also incredible for 5.95 you get a huge bagel, loaded with quality meat accompanied by a fountain soda (I refill like a mofo, I'm thirsty) & chips!  Way too much food needed for the average bear but at that price I can't complain."}
{"text":"This place is open till 3 and I barely made it in time the other day. I was hungry for some lunch and tried their roasted Veggie wrap. They sell Boar's Head by the pound here for all you meat lovers out there. While the inside of the wrap was a good veggie assortment it did not taste roasted and the tortilla did not seem to be cooked either. It got super doughy half way through, it was however a ginormous wrap that was piping hot for well over 20 minutes later. Next time I will come earlier in the day maybe that will be better I still want to try everything else here it was clean and about $6 for the wrap, chips, and a fountain drink. They also had coffee and a large assortment of tea bags along with a cooler chalk full of red bulls and Pepsi type products. Bagels & Lox I am so there again!"}
{"text":"Best bagels! Always taste fresh and the bread is soft. Good prices too. They also use boars head meats which is awesome too."}
{"text":"usually I'm a Hot Bagels girl, but i was studying up at deer valley area and had a hankering for a bagel sandwich.   It was very similar to Hot Bagels, except the bagel was 10 x better!   soft and chewy yet crispy on the outside.  I had a maple honey turkey on everything with all veggies and yellow mustard.  The lettuce was shredded and not very green, but the tomatoes were very juicy and fresh and the pickle was awesome. I liked that i got to pick my choice of potato chips too.  Definitely will be going back here and trying a egg bagel sandwich."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast lunch or a snack. 

Service 5 stars
Bagels 6 stars
Clean 5 stars
Price 5 stars

That is a 5.25

I get the hot pastrami on sesame seed bagel with swiss and thousand island dressing. The cheese is melted into the soft interior of the bagel while the hot pastrami and dressing combine to a wonderful flavor, topped by the chewy outer crust of the sesame studded bagel...  wheew  sorry

It comes with a drink and chips for $6.99."}
{"text":"They have a great selection of bagels and the coffee is good too. The place is fun to go to and they people are all very friendly."}
{"text":"I've come to this place several times and it never once has disappointed me.  Yum!  Need a heart attack anytime soon anybody?  Yeah, bagel pastrami sandwiches can provide that quick if you keep eating one, but boy is it good.  I might just take one for the team and suffer a heart shutdown :)  However, this place charges a pretty penny for something that basic - granted I'm not saying I can re-create any of their sandwiches, but wow we're in a recession man!  This place is definitely proud of their NY background and it shows on the walls; plus their accent is undeniable - ya heear!  -- yeah not sure if that's from NY either haha!  Regardless, I would recommend this joint if any of you are close by and stop for some heart-stopping food :) - enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great bagels. No ambience, and the coffee is mediocre, but the bagels are good!"}
{"text":"The sign says NYC bagels. I grew up in NYC eating real bagels. This places doesn't come close!!! The best NYC bagels I have found in Phoenix are at the bagel man in Ahwatukee. Far from here but I would try any place other than this place."}
{"text":"I was looking for a breakfast place and this popped up. The bagels are huge, they grill them and slather them with plain cream cheese. It was tasty and messy, but wonderful. The coffee was average. They do have a few tables outside, but it is so hot in Phoenix nobody but the out of towners sit out there."}
{"text":"These are the best bagels I've ever had! I had the sausage, egg, and cheese breakfast bagel on a sesame bagel. The eggs were made fresh, which is always a plus! The prices are really cheap too. $5 for a bagel and a drink."}
{"text":"This is probably the first time I have given such a bad review to any restaurant I have eaten at. My friends and I had gone for breakfast and it could not have been worse. The bagels had no taste and nor did any of the sides we ordered. How can you make such tasteless eggs and breakfast potatoes is something I cannot understand.
Worse there is a one cup limit on coffee. Can you believe it, for a breakfast place you get only one filling of coffee. Avoid this place like a plague if you can manage it."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to love this place, but I don't know. I have such mixed feelings, we had a breakfast sandwich and a create your own breakfast sandwich and they were really just average. Cream cheese was oddly runny.. Which I hate. And bacon that is cold is just lazy when there is no one in the place! At least heat it up and get it crispy. The bagels were good I suppose, but with the cream cheese being runny I may just have to opt for plain bagels.
Nice big spot though. Maybe we will try lunch bagel next time."}
{"text":"Best bagels! The breakfast ingredients used are great quality. My new favorite for breakfast."}
{"text":"I've been here once, because my hours are not quite \"bakers hours\".. but it was really really good. The service reminded me of being back home in my small town. Hubby had turkey on marble rye and I had a bagel sandwich. Both delicious. Service was fantastic. Don't live on this side of town anymore, but this is definitely a gem worth visiting."}
{"text":"New York style bagels that actually taste like New York Bagels. 

Service can be slow but the bagels are worth the wait. Go on the weekends and there is never a wait. 

Oh, and get their cookies. The oatmeal raisins are amazing."}
{"text":"Bagels are always fresh and the customer service is excellent!  Been coming here for years and the family running the place has always been kind to me."}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious. Great quality of food and taste.  Customer service was on cue and prices are very fair ."}
{"text":"These are some of the best bagels I've ever had and I'm a born and bred M.O.T., so trust me they are great.  Crusty on the outside, nice flavor and sweet and chewy on the inside.  They deli side is pretty good, only had breakfast sandwiches from them.

I get a dozen every few weeks and stick them in the fridge.  A little toasting and they return to their brilliance.  Hard to believe such good bagels exist in vapid NoPhx.  Thought the only stuff up there was giant corps and annoying hairstylists.

Side note:  The people who work there are not native English speakers, so when you whine to them over the phone about your order and complain, they might not totally understand you.  Oy."}
{"text":"Hands down, I just ate the best bagel I've ever tasted. I enjoy lox so much that I buy the Philadelphia cream cheese with salmon in it because it's the closest substitute I can afford on a regular basis.
I've had good lox in New Orleans, but I really haven't been thrilled with the bagels I've had here. That changed, however, upon my first visit to NY Bagels and Deli.
There was a constant flow of patrons, and the wait was negligible. The place is clean and the tv (bonus pts for having ESPN on) was without volume, keeping the noise level appropriate. They had almost every kind of bagel in stock, including blueberry, jalapeno, spinach, and the standards like everything, sesame, salt, etc. I chose the Nova on an onion bagel, which is smoked salmon, cream cheese, capers, red onions and tomato. The salmon portion was very generous for a $7 breakfast. I don't mind paying that much for a sandwich that doesn't skimp on quality ingredients! As others stated, the bagel has a great crispy exterior and fabulous, fluffy interior. I highly recommend this place if you're on the north side of Phoenix."}
{"text":"Nice family owned new York deli. All ingredients tasted fresh and the bagels were huge!! I had a hard time deciding on the menu but the chicken Philly was delicious. Definitely will be coming back here."}
{"text":"Went over here for a late breakfast, and was totally surprised with how delicious my Lox sandwich was.

The bagel was chewy, with a great crust, and an incredible amount of garlic on the bagel. I could see how someone could get annoyed by the amount of garlic, but garlic is pretty awesome, so take that as you will.

The sandwich was an awesome mix of the classic lox. Capers, Red Onion, Cream Cheese, Tomato, and delicious smoked salmon. 

However, what really set this place apart was that they served the sandwich WARM, which I have never had before. Part of me wanted to think that it was odd, but my first bite made all of my concerns float away.

It turned the sandwich into an amazing mush of fish, capers, onion, cream cheese, and tomato, and at that point, I was sold. 

I'll be coming back, for sure."}
{"text":"Not familiar with the area and really hungry, I drove around looking for something other than your typical fast food spots for breakfast.  Stumbled on this place and gave it a shot.  

First impression was that it was a big place and really clean.  Gentleman behind the counter was very friendly and told me the specials...and even made a point to mention the eggs are fresh.  

Got a bacon, egg and cheese sandwich on plain bagel and a spinach bagel with veggie cream cheese.  Split each half n half with someone.  Eggs were definitely freshly cracked and scrambled.  Bacon was good and of course the bagel was amazing!  Spinach bagel was delish!  Veggie cream cheese could use some more veggies but I'm guessing not everyone likes lots of veggies in their cream cheese like me.  

Their bagels are now my favorite in the valley.  Worth the drive when I'm craving a good real bagel!"}
{"text":"Great family owned establishment.  I enjoy their onion, bacon, egg and bagel with chive cream cheese.  Awesome NY style bagels.  You can get a dozen for $9.  Better than Einstein's or Chompies (gasp!)."}
{"text":"I work around the corner and have been going here since they have been open.  I have had nearly every sandwich on the menu and every bagel they offer.  They use Boar's Head meat (best of the best) and make their bagels fresh throughout the day.  

I am originally from NJ and consider myself a bit of a bagel snob.  I have had no luck around town trying to find a decent bagel.  There is one near my house (back east bagel's) that won New Times best bagel and it is one of the worst I have had.  That shows how weak the bagel gene pool is in this town.  But, NY bagels has a very good bagel and a variety to choose from.  

I get a dozen bagels to bring home and freeze to have for bfast on my way in to work.  I am not going to claim they are equal to a NY/NJ bagel, but they are the best I have had in town. 

The staff and owners are very friendly as well.  There are very few other locally run places in the area, most are fast food franchises.  

I have been going here for quite a while, and will continue to based on the quality of food, their cleanliness, and their friendliness."}
{"text":"The best bagels,breakfast sandwiches and lunch !! We come in a lot and enjoy just about everything they make us . On the plus side the owners are super awesome and it's down the street(walking distance) . Never disappoints"}
{"text":"I love this mom and pop deli. The bagels are always so fresh, omelets are delicious. And the Kona coffee is my favorite. Great place to meet friends for coffee or breakfast or lunch. The owners are really friendly and accommodating to special orders. I like that they have outside seating as well as a cozy couch inside. I only wish they were open on Sunday."}
{"text":"NY Bagels and Deli was one of my favorite breakfast places in North Phoenix before I moved to NJ. And my favorite breakfast sandwich was eggs with Turkey on an everything bagel. I've had bagels as breakfast sandwiches before - at Einstein Bros, Dunkin Donuts, etc - but the bagels at NY Bagels and Deli always tasted better. They also use Boars Head meat which probably adds to the overall taste. 

My only regret after I moved to NJ was that I never got to taste the sandwiches that were on the lunch menu. All in all, NY Bagels and Deli is a good place to grab a sandwich if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I went for my first time the other day. Had a Philly cheesesteak and it was delicious. Friendly and good service! a little pricey"}
{"text":"Their bagels are the best around and they are super friendly, however be learly of their meat. I picked up a turkey sandwhich today and the meat was rancid."}
{"text":"This is my family's go-to place for bagels and sandwiches.  We typically go Saturday mornings for breakfast, but sometimes end up there for lunch instead, so we have tried the bagels, bagel sandwiches, bagel breakfast sandwiches, omelettes, subs and other sandwiches.  I can't get past the bagels and bagel sandwiches myself -- my husband ventures a little more, but I dream of those bagels they are so delish!  I usually get the everything bagel...who am I kidding, I ALWAYS get the everything bagel with cream cheese, or I will get a BLT on the everything. 

 My husband loves the Asiago for the bagel, but has also tried the Rueben and the italian sub (among other things), which is on a wonderful fresh baked sub roll (I know this because I stole a bite while we went for a soda refill).   The family who runs this place is extremely friendly.  Everything is just so good!  And the prices are extremely reasonable."}
{"text":"In Phoenix for training and this place has soft  breakfast bagels. The bagels are soft Nice selection of beverages. The service is nice and welcoming. The eating area is clean and open. I haven't eaten lunch here yet, but maybe I will try it before I leave."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this hidden gem for several years now. Ben and Elda (The owners) are the nicest people! I believe they are from the Ukraine.They remember your names, and are always pleasant. I love that the prices are very cheap, and especially since all their meats are Boar's Head! The bagels are delicious, however, you simply cannot mimic bagels from NYC unless you're \"in\" NYC. But, these bagels are far better than anything else around in Phoenix. Great place to go! HIGHLY recommend."}
{"text":"The BEST Bagels in the Valley???

YES!!!

--------------------
Located on the Southeast Corner of 15th Ave and Deer Valley...snuggled on the very corner within the aisles of business complexes....it's easy to find!

They (I assume were the owners) are VERY proud of their Bagels here! They were so kind and cordial too, they even gave me one extra bagel with my order. (They do have a thick accent and didn't smile, but it did remind me so much of the authentic NYC charm that I so adore!)

The bagels were a  nice crisp on the outside, dense, and chewy....mmmm!

If I lived closer, I'd be eating their bagels everyday (and probably would weigh a bajillion pounds from it too!)

I look forward to trying their sandwiches on my next visit."}
{"text":"Owner is so warm and friendly- I felt like I was with family. I had the Philly cheese steak and it was delicious. The bread is homemade and incredible-reminds me of the bread back east."}
{"text":"Been here a few times already, basically every time I get a bagel craving on the way to work. It's small local business hidden in an industrial complex and maybe a little hard to find. The bagels here are reminiscent of bagels I would eat from NJ/NY. Hearty with just the right amount of chewiness. I always get an everything bagel with either plain or lox cream cheese. I haven't tried the other bagels but I'm sure they are all equally amazing."}
{"text":"I am from New York.  Born on the upper east side of manhattan to some yuppie parents and raised on the Gold Coast of Long Island.  I am a snob by nature.  To make matters worse when I was about 19 I decided I was brave enough to try my hand at cooking professionally.  Anywho fast forward about a decade I dropped cooking like a bad habit we don't need to get into what I actually do now. I'm more retired then anything.  Ok getting to the point.  When ever I decide to take a mental health day during the week or when I'm feeling frisky early on a Saturday this is my go to spot.  BEST BAGELS IN PHX.  #fact.  Two fried eggs bacon and cheese on a toasted everything bagel. Don't get fancy at this place stick to the basics and thank me later!"}
{"text":"There is nothing like the aroma of freshly baked bagels in the morning. It's a very cozy family owned business. Great friendly service and delicious bagel. It's reminiscent of growing up back in NY. I'll definitely be returning here!"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I order from this place all the time because it's close and we love the sandwiches. However, the last few times they messed up almost everything about our sandwiches. I ordered the Italian sub lunch special with no Italian dressing and no pickles with a 1/2 pound of potato salad and I even called back to check we ordered the right bread and went over the order NUMEROUS times with the guy. When I received my sandwich, it was completely soggy (with Italian dressing) with pickles and they gave me macaroni salad instead of potato. I called back and told the guy everything was wrong and he assured me that I could call back whenever and get a new sandwich for free. Well, I just called in and the guy who answered was a complete ass. He refused to give me my sandwich, saying I was lying and how was he supposed to know I was telling the truth. I still have my receipt and told him that. He refused to call his boss to check because I gave him my name and would not ask anyone else to see if they knew (which they should have). He then continued to yell at me and tell me I could come in tomorrow morning and he would give me the money when all I wanted was a sandwich for lunch today. He was so rude I finally hung up on him. We usually order from this place once sometimes twice a week and will not be back after this. They have messed up our food too many times and then insult me when I tried to call back (like the guy told me to). Lost a lot of business with us. And I just have to say, this is the first review I have EVER posted because I was really taken back by just how rude he was to me. Totally unbelievable."}
{"text":"Great Bagels, I come all he way from Gilbert. Simple place but prices are good and great food.  Not the friendliest people but, not rude. I'm  from the Northeast and it is NY Bagel, so adds to the ambiance!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great bagels, all boars head meat which is awesome. Overall great spot for breakfast or lunch!"}
{"text":"Decent.  Got an everything bagel with cream cheese and an onion bagel.  My total was  around $3.50.  Basically $1.00 a bagel and a $1.50 for cream cheese.  They tasted alright...the everything was better than the onion.  Service, while friendly, was really slow.  Only 2 dudes working in the place and they had an issue with their credit card machine plus were getting a ton of phone orders.  I appreciate that they apologized for the delay,  but they still seemed a bit disheveled.  This place is right across the street from work so I may be back to grab a bagel in the future."}
{"text":"The bagels are big and reasonably priced. $4.95 for sausage egg and cheese, $2.95 for bagel with cream cheese. The staff wasn't very friendly and there was only two staff in the morning. Their soda machine says one refill. I'll be back but I won't make it out of my way to go though."}
{"text":"Great drip coffee and great quick breakfast bagel sandwiches.  It reminds me of NY, down to the staff.  Definitely one of he better breakfast spots in the area.

Has couches and tvs in case you need to catch up on your morning news."}
{"text":"Great bagels...if you get there early they are still hot. Enjoyed the sausage cheese and egg with coffee special, just under $5. They use to have bottomless coffee but that is ok. Many places don't even include coffee any more. Family owned and my go to place for fresh New York Bagels. They are closed on Sunday."}
{"text":"This place is a great value for lunch. I get their bagel sandwiches on a regular basis!"}
