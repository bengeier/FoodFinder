{"text":"When the best thing one can say about a restaurant is that the food didn't make you sick, it shouldn't be considered a reason to try it out for yourself.  As one previous reviewer said, this is just bad American-Chinese food.

We ordered from here because we were feeling lazy and we wanted delivery that wasn't pizza.  Golden Dragon is close to home, and we figured that it wouldn't take too long for the order to arrive.

We ordered our usual new Chinese restaurant test menu, Beef Chow Mein and General Tso's chicken ... these are pretty easy dishes that are hard to mess up.  We also ordered a Tofu with Garlic Sauce.  The menu also said that you could get a free order of fried rice with purchase of $20 or more, and here is where things started to go south.  The guy on the phone told us that they don't offer the fried rice any more, but he would give us two cans of soda instead ... and the soda selections were Mountain Dew, Grape, Orange and others we didn't even recognize.  We passed on the soda.  It reminded me of Homer Simpson when his car was booted at the World Trade Center and the surly \"khavalch\" vendor only offered a beverage choice between Mountain Dew and Crab Juice; of course Homer chose the Crab Juice, wouldn't you?

To their credit, the delivery time wasn't bad.  The food however, was less than mediocre.  It was hard to tell the difference between the three items, by appearance, taste and texture.  My partner, being Chinese, was offended that this was being passed off as the food of his people.  Adding insult to injury, he was infuriated by Golden Dragon's version of chow mein - the word chow mein in Chinese means \"Fried Noodle\" and if you've ever ordered it in a semi-passable Chinese restaurant, you probably remember vegetables and meat poured over a bed of crispy pan fried noodles.  This is not to be confused with lo mein, which are also noodles covered with vegetables and meat, but in lo mein, the noodles aren't fried crispy.  

So the Golden Dragon version of chow mein was a brown mush of beef bits and a mass of soggy bean sprouts.  When we opened it up, we couldn't figure out where the noodles were, and I went so far as to wonder out loud if maybe they were using bean sprouts instead, or maybe they even forgot to include the noodles - as we were having this discussion, I was munching on a small bag of crispy wonton skin like you might add to a bowl of hot and sour soup; I figured this was some little complimentary munchy thing they included with all their orders.  You can probably see where this is going ... it was just then that the reality of the situation became clear to me and I understood that these stupid little wonton skin strips were supposed to be the fried noodles for the chow mein.  I told my partner what I just realized and he was incredulous - he spent about three minutes telling me that was impossible, because it was the antithesis of chow mein.  He ultimately felt the need to call Golden Dragon and verify that this was the case ... he spent a few minutes speaking with the guy in English trying to say that there were no noodles with the dish and explaining that these wonton skins were not noodles.  Suddenly he switched to Mandarin and a torrent of loud invective poured out as he sought clarification in a language the guy on the phone might understand.  \"How can you even consider yourself Chinese,\" my partner said to the guy?!  \"Your food brings shame to your family and all Chinese people.\"  There was more than that, but I thought it was the most telling part.

Needless to say, we tossed most of it and we were out $23.  My advice, steer clear."}
{"text":"I love their food, and its not too greasy. I've been going to eat here for years! The owners are so nice and always ask about my kids, etc and remember me every time I go there, which sometimes is a few months apart. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I'm new to the area, and looking for a go-to Chinese delivery place. 

For some reason this place has great reviews on Urban Spoon, and I should have checked Yelp first. I know that when you order a crispy dish for delivery, it won't be perfect, but I've been ordering crispy Chinese food delivered for a long time, and this was not even edible. The meat itself was chewy, the coating completely soggy, and swimming in sauce. 

When I called the restaurant to say the food was not even edible, I was told that's just what happens when you get food delivered, and had I eaten there it would have been fine. 

Will never eat here again. Complete waste of $20."}
{"text":"I have never been so aggravated!! I ordered for delivery, gave clear address and instructions, over an hour later the driver was literally a block away and called because she couldn't find the location. I desperately tried to talk her to the location, she gave up and canceled my order, I called the manager, also gave him detailed directions from the map...nope...they just canceled my order. Unbelievable!! I don't even live in Cleveland, they do and they don't know how to get someplace??!!! Ahhhhhhhh DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"The food to me is really good. The beef in the beef and broccoli is really cheap and chewy like you would expect for the price you are paying, but the shrimp in the shrimp fried rice is great. 
If it wasn't for the awful experience I had with their daughter, I would have returned just for the food. I ordered one of their combo dinners where you get fried rice, an egg roll and one side. We'll I ordered one of these and some crab ragoons. The daughter wasn't listening correctly and when the price became more than I thought it should be, I asked her to reread the order for me. She had put down two of the combos and when I politely told her that I only wanted one and apologized for the miscommunication, she got an attitude with me and was very rude.

I have since changed to Amazing Wok II on S. Taylor in Cleveland Heights and am able to order online and have had fast delivery and the most polite delivery drivers. I will never go back to Golden Dragon again. You lost a very loyal customer!!"}
{"text":"I order delivery here often, and although they may not be the friendliest, I keep coming back! They have late night delivery and the general tso chicken is good. My roomates and I crave their food almost weekly. The more the staff see you, the more they warm up. It's no 5 star restaurant,  but for it's a great option for a cheap late night dinner."}
{"text":"The food here is terrible. We actually tossed both of our meals (general Tsos and ). The staff is unfriendly and made it very difficult to order. A definite poor choice for Chinese.

I'd try Amazing Wok II, friendlier staff and decent take-out."}
{"text":"While waiting for Lemongrass to open we stopped in to warm up and grab some appetizers. The lights were off in the dining room and we would've thought the place was closed had we not seen someone sitting at a table in the dark. My friend had egg rolls, which he assured me were darn good; however, I'm not exactly sure what was in those overly salted triangles of crab rangoon (I tasted no cream cheese and no crab).

There were used dishes sitting on one of the tables before we arrived that were still there when we left."}
{"text":"This is a bad American-Chinese take-out place.  While I've had worse, I must say that the standards in this area are high and it puzzles me how this place can stay open when there are so many better options available.

In particular, what makes this restaurant inferior to the average American-Chinese fare is the fact that the chefs do not know how to choose which vegetables to put in which dishes.  Instead, they seem to throw the same combinations of vegetables in all the dishes.  For example, green peppers and onion chunks go fairly well with the Chinese-American curry dishes, but they do not go well with many other dishes, and yet they throw them in virtually everything.  The dishes here all taste the same, most of the stuff is quite muddled, and all of it is mediocre."}
{"text":"I'm always a little skeptical of hole in the wall Chinese restaurants (or any to be honest), but this was not what I had expected. The general tso's was AMAZING. And the portions are giant. The staff is so kind, and the inside of the building was clean and not freaky in any means. I'm definitely turning here the next time my Chinese food craving kicks in!"}
{"text":"I was sick and wanted to order some kind of soup to eat, so I ordered the wonton egg drop soup and the sesame chicken. I've ordered here previously and the lady on the other end of the line was not only rude and curt with me, but didn't tell me the total that I owed or anything remotely kind or useful, like about how long it would take. I waited for a very long time to receive my delivery order that time. Close to an hour, maybe more. No call to let me know either.

This time, however, the man on the other end of the line was very nice, patient, and was generally great. The delivery came quickly, much more quickly than I expected, and the delivery man was very nice and patient with me.

Now, the food. I tend to not expect too much out of delivery chinese food, so it's usually just as I expect. Covered in some sort of sauce, probably fried, etc. The sesame chicken was just as I expected, and it was pretty good. My only complaint is that it was very overpriced (I believe it'd be an equivalent of a quart and it was close to $10). 

The wanton egg drop soup though...it'd be a compliment to say it was bad tasting. It was terrible. The wanton skins were wrapped around some sort of sour cabbage, which should be a mixture of ground pork and tasty. The soup was bland, extremely starchy, and thick. I don't know how they messed up the wanton part so bad, but they didn't do the soup part right either. I'd stick to the fried and covered in sauce foods here."}
{"text":"My family has ordered here since I moved here 9 years ago. I have tried various places around the Cleveland Heights area and this is the only place we now order our Chinese dish fix.  

We generally order the general tso's chix, sweet and sour chix, and chix lo mein.  I do ask that my general tsos be made spicier and we always request \"no msg.\"  They do make things in house and like anything made in house it may vary, but tonight, our order was the best general tso's chix i have ever had and the freshest and crunchiest lo mein by a mile!! 
The perfect spiciness and how fresh the lo mein was is what prompted me to finally write a yelp review.  

I am not sure why people give reviews about negative customer service, as they have always been kind and the father has even come out of the kitchen (when picking up our food) to give my son and daughter a fortune cookie personally.  They have always been kind, but there is a slight language barrier (when their daughter is not answering the phone). They are all very kind and courteous!  I must say that i will be truly sad and excited when their daughter goes off to college. 

I also love the fact that this is a family business and reflecting on seeing the family grow is something that is truly special; this is why people should shop local, it is this kind relationship building that makes a business more than just brick and mortar!"}
{"text":"OK turns out that when you explore the menu as I have done over the last 18 months, and you compare it to crappy Richie changes down the street, the food here is REALLY good. they even get friendlier as you become a regular. don't let that lack of decor fool ya, this is where ya wanna order your Chinese food when you're in Cleveland heights."}
{"text":"Nothing glamorous, but the food was exactly they way I like it. Mall food court Chinese is kind of my thing, and this place most certainly met my needs without forcing me to go into a mall!  The fried rice was tasty and not the fake yellow stuff that I have been served elsewhere and the egg drop soup was piping hot and yummy. I really would not have any room to complain about the quality of a $7 meal. The inside of the restaurant could use a little freshening up and the service could be a tad friendlier. 

Overall, I would say that this place is a 3.5 for take-out and a 3 for dining in."}
{"text":"I must be crazy but I really like this place.  This IS my go-to Chinese take out restaurant.  The owners are a sweet married couple and their kids are always there and are cool.  I just get typical stuff, general tso's, wonton soup, egg rolls...It's always exactly what I expect."}
