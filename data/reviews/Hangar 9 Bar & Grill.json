{"text":"I was very disappointed about how long it took to get our dinner.  It took 1 and 1-2 hours to get our food.  My enchiladas were cold.  They had 1 server for the entire restaurant.  The only reason we didn't leave is because I had a Groupon I bought & needed to use it.  I will not be returning."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed ourselves. The food and mixed drinks we had were delicious. The staff was friendly and our waitress was very prompt with our order. I'll definitely be returning !!"}
{"text":"Had Lunch here yesterday with my two kids,, service was very good and the food was very good. I ate here before but it had a different name and it was horrible. Not sure if it's the same owner but it definitely is a good place to eat now.

Thanks"}
{"text":"Stopped in to have a beer after work, Stephanie the daytime bartender was quick to the beer and recommended the wings for happy hour ... I'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"I went there during the NBA finals,  I enjoyed the food and the service. My issue were the drinks, I wasn't told about a $3 upcharge per drink on a change in alcohol. I had left my bill on card on abs paid a cash tip, yet was charged for my tip from the vendor. Overall I think they do a great job, I won't be returning though."}
{"text":"Great food! Loved coming here the staff is great! Maryanna is wonderful! Best server I've ever had!! And ur tats are amazing! The atmosphere is wonderful! Enjoyed myself fully thanks again!"}
{"text":"Came here for Monday night football.  Great atmosphere, lots of tv's, and good food.  Service was excellent.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered the big booty Judy to go and it was ready to go within 15 minutes with great service and the food was even better!"}
{"text":"Pricing is normal for a basic bar and grill. The band wagon really so good and the drink prices and staff were were equally a nice surprise! Good job Hangar 9 bar. This place was ...awesome. live music fans everywhere! And it was so great to see such support for the live music scene."}
{"text":"This review is not related to the staff. They work hard and are great. This is aimed at the miserable owner. She knows who she is. I attempted to to have a calm conversation with her, about a bill discrepancy, she was so defensive. She told me \"there's a lot of people here, i don't need your business. Duly noted.  As a small business owner she should know about net detractors, now I am one. Sooo if your shadow darkens the doorway of this establishment's, beware of the owner!  Just pay your bill and move on."}
{"text":"Good bar. Great patio. Loved our server Kaitlin. She was super friendly and attentive.  Will return because of her!!!"}
{"text":"Table fair rates 7-8, but what make's this place so good is the staff, and the manager is out standing at her job. A solid customer service professional 10 out of 10."}
{"text":"Very welcoming restaurant and bar. Went to grab a bite and watch the UofA game. The food was good and the wait staff friendly. Very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"The staff is great but be wary of being over charged. If you order a well drink they charge $2 for ice! When we asked the owner we were told that's are policy and if u don't like it get out and never come back. It's not about the money it's about principal! When we ordered macallen 12 they don't charge only well for ice?... Never going back!"}
{"text":"New hang, comfortable, good food, smoking area Iam Like"}
{"text":"Super cool place for aviation enthusiasts to have lunch or breakfast and watch the planes take off and land. The food is okay, service is good and the atmosphere is terrific! I recommend sitting outside, if possible."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best bars in the Chandler area. The staff is very friendly! I returned the weekend following my first visit and the bartender was able to recall my name. Affordable drink prices, plenty of tv's, pool tables, and cornhole. Fun place to hang with friends"}
{"text":"The wings were good.  My wife had the nachos.  One thing to know is that the chili on the nachos is a sweet chili.  Kind of weird to put sweet chili on nachos.  We will probably go back if we are I the area, but just not get the nachos.  The menu is small but that's ok.  The waitress was great, Marianna, I think was her name.  She was talkative and helpful."}
{"text":"Awesome little bar!  Drink specials are good and there's two pool tables in the outdoor bar area.  Bartender was nice but pretty busy.  They have phone chargers at the bar - something I've never seen before, and a great concept!  I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Usually a nice place to hang out. but kind of disappointed last night.  Asked the bartender to close the doors to the patio as the smoke was pretty bad.  She refused \"because they don't get to open them very often due to the weather\". (???) SO we moved to a table away from the bar.  15 minutes later she closed all the doors. Not sure if she was TRYING to be a b@%^$# but she was surely in a mood.  Won't mention her name but Stan and Sarah are GREAT."}
{"text":"Yes, this is one of my favorite places to hang out. The bartenders, wait staff, chefs, and owners are great - seriously! The food is also terrific. I enjoyed a healthy lunch that filled my tummy for under $10! The side salad is a nice size, fresh, and served with a homemade dressing. The turkey sandwich was also quite tasty. They change up the beers often and the full bar has something for everyone. Awesome sports bar with a great team of people who make the entire experience a positive one!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood restaurant and bar! Loved it! So excited to have a place right next to our house. Waitstaff was excellent,  food was great and dig their beer selection.  We even got free beer! :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here on a Monday night for the first time. The food was okay and it was pretty empty that night. We got there just after Happy hour menu ended, but The happy hour menu didn't seem too enticing. Our waitress was okay, not bad and not amazing. Overall an average sports bar."}
{"text":"oh yeah bud this place is sweet.

Pretty straight forward beer seller here. Come here with my pig friends and get down to business. Chug a mug or 40, play some bags in the....patio.....indoor.....jail.....smoke house.....room thing or maybe some pool. They have a couple Golden Tee games in there too so you can show your friends how big of a gaming loser you are.

would totally give 5 stars but theres a tv in the back corner thats black and white for some reason and IT DRIVES ME CRAZY. but its no big thang

bottom line, staff is great, food is bar food, tons of TVs playing whatever match is on and the patrons seem to be treats. RIDEEEEEEE"}
{"text":"I stop here when I have time before my hair appointments and I just love this place! 
*great food- it's not just bar food!
*friendly staff
*great for big groups on their patio
*games

They can get busy, so patience is a virtue."}
{"text":"I come here at least three times a week.  Heather is our favorite she knows her stuff and makes us feel welcomed and remembered.  She really is a great asset to your team and is the reason we keep coming back!

This place is so clean better then any place I have ever been and that alone is a good reason to come to this place.  Sam takes an amazing care of this place and she really cares to make it an amazing experience for each visitor.  Cheers to Heather and Sam great job!!!"}
{"text":"Love the atomsphere the place is huge. service is better from the last time i visited. Dont order the soup. really miss the antipasta salad."}
{"text":"The place is decent. Its nice that they have a smoking patio. We ordered the queso and guacamole with chips and the queso was cold. The beer cheese & pretzels were also a little cold.  We also had 3 girls serving us which was so confusing. The drinks took forever to come out & we sat there for a while with empty cups. Cool atmosphere & Is come back to give it a second chance. Wasn't terrible just not a great first experience."}
{"text":"I'm giving it two stars because it's a nice place with a great setup.  Everything else terrible.  it took forever to get a drink..longer to order our food and then when we did get our food it made me wish we went to Panda Express across the street.  Quality was terrible, flavorless and not worth the price.  It was a real letdown - we were hoping for something nice but we're very disappointed.  Place was not even full and could not get our waitress to help us get some ketchup and sweet n low."}
{"text":"Our first time in was a pleasant surprise.  We did not expect a bar with good food and a great list of beers.  Be sure to check out the chalk board for the current list of beers on tap.   It is great having a spot close that not only has good food, great beer selection but also good service.  The wait staff took their time with us newbies and went over the beers on tap.. which change out on a regular basis and I think there are about 30 of them.  Happy hour Monday - Saturday.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Friendly server but place dark,drab,needs update.Had the reuben,which was good,but very soggy,like sauerkraut was not drained,and was quite messy,served with 1 napkin,needed a package.In today's competitive bar restaurants could do better"}
{"text":"I love this bar. You won't find better bartenders, especially Stan and Stephanie. Good beers on tap and tasty food. The game side is cool to hang out in also, with pool, bean bag toss, golden tee. This is a nice spot."}
{"text":"We went to Hangar 9 late afternoon yesterday. It wasn't obvious whether we should seat ourselves so we did. We had several different servers who were all very pleasant. The happy hour drinks prices were great. The menu and its prices were fine but our big disappointment was the food. We ordered the fish fry, the pb&j wings, the garlic parmesan wings, the pretzels and beer cheese, and tater tots. The tater tots were the only food we cared for and those tasted like Oreida frozen tater tots which are hard to ruin. It's a good sports bar if you are looking for lots of TVs and cheap drinks."}
{"text":"We go here all the time.  They have a smoking section, good food, pool tables, juke box, service is good and of course there is Stan, excellent bartender.  They recently added a few new items to the menu and I tried the chicken fried steak with mash potatoes and veg. OMG LUV.  Having that again and again and again."}
{"text":"That finally got this place right. This has changed owners and names several times. Now the menu is perfect with a blend of superior items. It's bar food, not its awesome. They finally put someone in the kitchen that has talent. The beer choices are great and rotated frequently."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great service, great food, great drink specials. Love this place so far and definitely will be back. They have a ladies night every night, and good deals on football Sunday. Clean place but still a great bar. Lots of TVs and they even label who is playing on the TVs on football Sunday."}
{"text":"Great bar not far from my house, with awesome daily/nightly specials and like another reviewer said, refreshingly delicious food that is above the norm.  Service was good, and happy to have a great place like this just a few minutes away from me.  Being involved heavily in aviation, I also appreciate the theme of this place and is another nice refreshing deviation from your typical neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"Favorite bar in chandler, love the atmosphere. What keeps me coming back is the great service and food. Every server there is on top of it, never have ask for a refill or box. After 2 years, this place has never disappointed!"}
{"text":"My buddy suggested we try out this place to watch the USA/Netherlands semi-final and have some supper after I got off work.  He got there early and got us a table and I arrived shortly after.  Menus were already on the table so I started looking to see what I wanted.  Found a sandwich that looked interesting under one of the sections of the menu that stated the sandwiches came with your choice of one side and then listed the choices.  

So, when the waitress came to take our order I had already decided which side I wanted.  When I told the waitress, who never introduced herself, what I wanted she told me that, that sandwich doesn't come with a side.  I pointed to the section heading and the area underneath that said that the sandwiches came with a side.  She said that, that was a misprint and that the sandwich I wanted did not come with a side.  I again pointed at \"their menu\" that they are putting out in front of customers stating that it \"DID\" come with a side.  She said she could get the manager and I said fine.  

The manager comes out and the first thing she says is, \"My waitress already explained to you that the sandwich doesn't come with a side. What's the problem?\"  I said the problem is your menu... She says abruptly, \"it's a misprint\" which I said \"that's not my fault its its? You're the one putting these in front of your customers and it says that it comes with a side\".  Which she abruptly says again, \"My waitress told you it doesn't come with a side and I explained it doesn't come with a side and it is a misprint.\"  I replied, \"Again, that is not my and until you change it some way such as putting a sticker next to the sandwich stating this sandwich does not come with a side, you have to go by what your menu says.\"  She argued with me a couple more minutes until she finally said, \"I'll do it for you this time but don't come in and expect it again\".  She said it as if she was doing me a favor when it was \"their mistake\" for not having proof read the menu before allowing the printer to make up their whole stock of menus. Then at the end of the meal when my buddy picked up the check he found they had charged for my side that I got with the sandwich.  My buddy pointed it out to the waitress and she disgustedly said ok and took it back to take the charge off.  

They had Trivia Night going on which we did not know before going there to try to watch the baseball game. That was totally our fault.  But, with that going on it was hard to keep up with what was going on, on the ball game.  The waitresses service was lackluster at best.  The only redeeming factor in this whole night and meal was the food itself.  The chef/cook did a very good job and the food was at least acceptable which is what saved this place from a 1 star rating. 

 I would not recommend this place to anyone and would recommend the chef/cook find a better organization to work for.  If they treat their customers this way, I would hate to see how they treat their employees.  Maybe a good place for Jon Taffer to pay a visit to because they clearly have no focus as to what type of bar & grill they want to be."}
{"text":"A very surprising place indeed. We went for Halloween night, and it wasn't packed like we thought it'd be. This place is a few streets over from Arizona Ave, so it's not as crazy on a weekend. 

Food and drinks are shockingly affordable, we had a 14 inch pie for 10$, you can't beat that! 22oz drafts were 5$ and 6$ for premium. 

Music was a little loud, but it's a bar, that's the atmosphere. It's themed aeronautically, which is neat.  The staff was dressed up for Halloween. 

Good quick spot with just enough choices for a bite to eat. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic, it has a good atmosphere great decor and amazing food.  I tried the wings and wrap both were quality and affordable.  It's safe to say I found my new sports pub."}
{"text":"Our order was wrong, the servers explanation was, \"well, I couldn't exactly remember, so I guessed\".  The replacement meal took 40 minutes and when she set it on the table, there was a long human hair cooked in it that we pulled out right in front of the server.  Her response was to act irritated and offer to make our food again.. We declined and just asked for the check for our drinks.  I asked to speak to The manager, since neither server had even apologized for the 2 inedible meals, she came overand let us know she room the food off our bill...which was great, since we didn't have any food...and then said...things happen...still no apology...we won't be back"}
{"text":"There are few places in the east valley to go out to watch the Arizona Rattlers Arena football. We found that Hangar 9 was having a watch party, so we decided to try it out. 
We had the most fabulous service! Our server's name was Reena and she brought her A game and then some. 
The bar was busy and loud, lots of fans milling around, but she really kept up well. She had tasty suggestions for menu items, kept our table cleared, and our glasses full.  Very friendly person! 
The only downside was the ladies room. The paper towel dispensers on the wall were jammed. You could clearly see there was plenty of paper inside both of them, but it was all wrinkled up and not dispensing. There was a large roll of the dispenser-style toweling on the counter. I wasnt a huge fan of that.
There was also an *aroma* that spoke, possibly, of problems with the sewer lines. 
However, we thoroughly enjoyed all the other aspects and plan to come to many more watch parties here at Hangar 9!"}
{"text":"I went to this sports bar to watch a playoff hockey game  after work. I sat down on the patio during the first intermission. I saw 3 different waitresses serving the patio. With 6 minutes left in the 2nd period a waitress finally asked if I needed a drink. At that point I had sat for 20 or 25 minutes on that patio and was finally addressed. I reluctantly ordered a beer, the waitress came out twice after that without my beer. She asked me if someone had gotten me my beer. I responded no and told her to forget about it. I started to walk out the door and she told me that she would buy my beer. I explained that wasn't necessary that I had sat for an entire hockey period Without being addressed. I will not be returning to this establishment. I am giving this two stars because she did try to win me back with a free beer."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of their mac!

Usually service is ok, but just ok. However last time we came my sister who is pregnant waited forever for her food after everyone else received theirs. Only to find out they forgot the order for the one pregnant hungry girl at the table."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in the area, thought bar food sounded good, and this place hit the spot. Before ordering I read the previous Yelp reviews. I think people were a little harsh. It is a bar which generally means small menu comprised of bar food. We had the snake bites for an appetizer which were good in their own realm of fried food. We also split honey hot wings that were cooked to perfection and a grilled ham and cheese which was so yummy! Sometimes a simple grilled ham & cheese can be so delicious. And my husband says their Coke Cola is good and crisp (whatever that means, I stuck with water, ha ha). If we lived over by Hanger 9, we'd probably return for another bar food binge."}
{"text":"Today was the first time I have been in this place. I was impressed with their selection of beer on tap. I was there for happy hour, and the prices are great. They have a large selection of food, and the items we ordered were fantastic.
I will be back to see what's? next on the beer rotation."}
{"text":"Stephanie is amazing! She's the only reason we come here. Well, maybe Stan too!! But definitely Stephanie!! Love the service and food."}
{"text":"PROS:

1-Aviation Theme - love it!!!

2-Stan our server was pretty cool

3-Interesting beers

4-Food was decent - rattler bites were awesome and the PB&J wings (recommended by Stan) were actually surprisingly good.

CONS:

1-HIDDEN CHARGES-
Don't be surprised to be billed $0.50 for a side of mayonnaise for your burger (or bring some mayo packets with you in your purse! haha) & another $0.50 for carrots and celery with your wings. (I guess I always assumed servers were asking if we wanted carrots and celery because they didn't want to waste it if we weren't going to eat it. Nope...here they're upselling you to purchase garnish. Lol. I guess I never thought to ask if I would be charged. From now on every place that asks me will experience me asking if they are charging me for it. I'll munch a carrot or two for free but I'm not paying for that. Aaaaaand another $0.50 for each side of ranch. No free dips with the wings here, people! 
PS: if you're a blue cheese fan, evidently that costs half as much so you can shell out only $0.25 for blue cheese. I would have made so many different decisions had I known these things. Could've saved a couple bucks!

2-Seems that the beers change a lot so you can never think \"Oh, that place has _________ and I love that so I'm going back to get one!\" because they might not have it. The good news is they'll let you sample some beers to find one you might like that they DO have in stock. :D

3-The menu is pretty small. Check it out before you go because it's very limited.


Bottom line...I'll probably hit this place up in the future for happy hour, daily specials, and appetizers."}
{"text":"I'm here for lunch and surprised that this place isn't much more busy. It's got a cool vibe and great food as far as I can tell. I had some kind of Turkey sandwich work chillies and avocado and I loved it. It's much bigger on the inside than it looks from the outside. Thanks."}
{"text":"The first time I went in after moving to Chandler I instantly felt familiar, like putting on a pair of shoes perfect fitting jeans and just relaxing. Go in midweek just for a nightcap sometimes and say hi to the girls behind the bar. They take such good care of me and they love you too! Everybody there is friendly and warm and welcoming.  The food is great and you can order all the way up until close to closing on a limited menu but still lots to choose from. Check it out and fun pool tables, cornhole, Golden Tee, new faces and locals. Huge and closed and separate patio that has access to the bar and it's a smoking area. so you don't have to go sit outside if your a smoker you can stay at the bar and shoot pool and enjoy"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this place especially the so called female manager..Very unkept nasty disrespectful attitude. She has no people skills at all.. Shouldn't be working in this type of industry especially if you can't problem solve or show Respect and listen to a customer that has been going to this establishment for several years basically longer than she been employed there.. I walked in like I do almost three times a week and on every Thursday...I sat at the bar along the end of the bar...I was wearing my MC CUTS which I have with no issues at all. And the male bar tender ask for a CC I said since when I never been ask to give a CC ..I simply said I'll pay as I go..As he walked away a male sitting at the bar said \"wow thats crazy he didn't ask for mine\" and I decided to asked the gentleman next to me and he is a regular and he said he didn't take my CC nor did he take one from the previous ppl sitting at the bar. When the bartender was giving me my beer I asked when did this new thing of taking CC he was hesitant to say then said oh yeah Sunday..I said wow that funny because I was here Monday and the new female bartender didn't ask for my CC ..I was little pissed off so as he was bringing back my change I told he he could keep the beer just give me my change....I said so you didn't ask anyone else for CC but just me am I like special because I am wearing a set of cuts he said I don't know.. so I said I'll never come here again and I will make sure no one from my chapter comes here especially on Thursday...And I'll make it my business to let the other MCs that come out with us not to spend any money here. As I began to walk out obviously the clueless scared bartender walked to the end of the bar to cackle with the girls and explain what happened I'm sure the punk lied about the whole incident. So I was being stared at and I spoke directly at  to the unkept so called mgr..And I started to explain if your gonna start a new rule/policy learn to be consistent as I was finishing my sentence she interrupted me and waved her nasty hand at me and said GOODBYE... wow some customer service..I hope the owner takes action.but I will never step foot in that place again. You lost a steady Respectful patron...Some ppl need to take a people skills class..."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I are new to the area and instantly fell in love with this place! Awesome place to hang out and shoot pool. The staff is super friendly and the prices are pretty reasonable. You definitely have to try to buffalo potato skins!!!"}
{"text":"Has to be one of the best bars in Chandler! Great staff, great food, and great people. Would definitely recommend this bar for hanging out with friends or going to meet new people. Even the regulars are all awesome. Also great place to catch the games during the season."}
{"text":"Just had the craziest experience in any bar I've ever been to.  I was charged $2 for ice on a well scotch.  We then had macallan 12 and weren't charged for ice.  What bar charges for ice. Really???  We just spent $150 for food and drink and asked the waitress about the charge.  Sweet kid had the owner stop by our table to explain that \"all bars do this\". Hmmmm I'm 50plus and never experienced this before.  Long story short we explained it wasn't the $2 per drink for ice it was the principal.  She said we were given an extra 1/2 pour for this.  I said then just charge me for the pour not the ice it's misleading.  Explained as a customer we can spend our money anywhere and she said please go ahead and don't come back.  All this over charging for ice on scotch.    Personally I have no intentions in going to a place where the owner doesn't appreciate its customers.  It's not like the place is special in any way, it's a local dive bar with average bar food and a good bartender.  Sorry Stan we won't be back.  Too bad Stan's a great bartender."}
{"text":"So disappointed with the owner Becki, she does not care about her customers. The place is run down and the prices on the menu keep going up. I used to hang out there because it was my local pub but after seeing the owners true colors I will never spend another dime there. The ladies behind the bar are the only good thing about the place. I hope they find good positions at better bars soon and get out of that dump."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch last weekend & let me say the Service was Excellent! We were advised Appetizers were half off for Happy Hour so chose the Buffalo Chicken Potato Skins which were very good - ordered Boneless Wings they were just ok. What we enjoyed the most is seeing the employees happy & attentive to their guests - will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Came in today with a group of 14 people.  Burgers were fantastic!  Chicken wings were great!! Slider trio was awesome.  Overall great food and fantastic service!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This was my second time at Hangar 9, and what a great experience! My friends and I sat on the patio and we were so glad to see that they had the heaters working! Our server, Reena, was sweet and prompt, but more importantly she was really helpful with the food and beer suggestions. We stayed for at least two hours just having a blast. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Came here to watch game 6 of the NBA finals with a couple of friends. It was fairly busy but not to a point where you had to wait 1.5 hours to get mediocre food. Plus to add on to that not even get acknowledge for service. We literally had to leave our tables and go to the bar to be served. And once we received our plate, which mine was BBQ beef sandwich it was not to my standards of good. The fries were dry and the sandwich wasn't anything to rave about. Please Hangar 9 get your acts together cause this experience was not one that I can rare about."}
{"text":"There is a Special Thank you to our waitress Shelby! We had a large group and she was the only waitress. The food was  awesome! Good prices on Happy Hour! But most important they have Shelby!!!
Our surprise for our daughter was a hit!"}
{"text":"Good service and great drinking bar.  Happy hour specials were legit.  Food was a C+ at best.  I had the green chili Mac and he had the chicken nachos.  Portions were good but chicken was dried out cubes likely days old.  Green chili Mac had little to no spice.  I would order a burger next time.  Nice asst of beers but bartender could not remember what the rotating taps were.  All turned out to be IPA's.  Need more variety."}
{"text":"Was just there for a Chandler Chamber Lunch Club.  Food was excellent and so was the service.  I like my food hot and they delivered.  It was also prepared with fresh ingredients and was tasty.  I will be back.  Great neighborhood hang out!"}
{"text":"An amazing local establishment! The Mother and Daughter team that run this place are amazing people that really care about their customers. The beer is always cold, the servers are always attentive (and hot), the food is fabulous and management is amazing. Definitely a place that I will frequent often and not just because it's within walking distance, but, because of the staff and ownership!"}
{"text":"Great place to come hang out especially with groups of friends and family. This place has great deals seven days a week and go to happy hour. My personal favorite 
\"dollar beers\" on Mondays"}
{"text":"Don't go for the food.  My husband and I decided to try this place for the first time because of all the positive reviews and we were very disappointed.  

To begin when we walked in we were not greeted, there was no sign telling us to seat ourselves or wait for a server. 

Next we had read on their website site that they served breakfast all day Saturday and Sunday,  we asked our server who said she would get us the menu,  but came back and said they stopped serving breakfast on Saturday about a week ago.  

We decided to try the dinner \"special\" which is chicken fried steak.  When our meals arrived it was obvious the chicken fried steak was frozen and the gravy came out of a can.  The instant mashed potatoes weren't half bad. 

If you have asthma and are sensitive to cigarette smoke,  forget about it.  They have a patio for smoking customers,  but they leave the roll up windows between the bar and the patio open,  so there is no separation."}
{"text":"OMG! I can't say enough about this hidden breakfast gem! The food is outstanding and the atmosphere fantastic! It's so cool to watch the planes take off and lane while you eat! They also have a lot of old planes and some replicas in the hangar you can look at while you wait to eat! Oh yeah, and you will have to wait on a Saturday or Sunday because it gets crowded but it's worth it! Don't forget to sign in when you get there too! There's no hostess, just a sign in sheet at the end of the counter!"}
{"text":"Great sports bar, we went to watch a game. Big TV everywhere! The bartender/waitress was really nice and attentive. They have a great happy hour for beer!"}
{"text":"Liked it, we ate late lunch so it was pretty empty. Everything we had was good. Going to give them another try later in the day."}
{"text":"Love the BYO Burger Night on Tuesdays. Half off! It's a huge burger, cooked to perfection with a premium, brioche-type bun. We ordered fries on the side. They come in your own little fry-basket. Drinks were great! Service was excellent. We've been 2-3 times now and we're hooked."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great neighborhood bar this is it. Servers are nice, they've got a new menu and a cocktail menu. Don't expect a 5 star sushi experience but if you're looking for a jukebox, corn hole and a well intentioned middle class this is it*. Cheers. 
*and I truly mean that in the best way possible."}
{"text":"Good food and nice staff.  I can't remember the last time a couldn't finish such a great burger.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Great place and great atmosphere... They have happy hour from 2-7 and then every night is ladies night, specials for them is 7pm-10pm so that's pretty good.

They have rotating beers and always have some sort of special. Very very responsibly priced.

Lots of tv's and they have football specials beginning in Sept... Also a great outside patio for when it cools off."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a quick lunch during the week, good food and awesome draft choices. The service is fast, the bar is clean, I can take over the jukebox from my phone, and Stephanie is awesome!"}
{"text":"Went there for their St Pattys celebration. We arrived around 930. We found a table after about 5 minutes. Once we sat down we waited and waited for someone to greet us, 20 minutes went by without a greeting. 10 minutes later I saw a server and said excuse me to try to catch her attention. She looked directly at me, didn't say a word, and walked away. We moved to a different booth hoping for service. Once again no one greeted us although we saw 4-5 servers pass us multiple times. My husband and brother in law went up to the bar to get beers, this is only \"service\" we received for the 2 hours we were there. We understand it was a busy night, but we saw plenty of tables being served, and were blatantly ignored. We even saw a table that came in after us and got service rights away...That being said, this place is not recommended."}
{"text":"This place continues to disappoint. Went there to unwind after a long day of work.  Arrived at 8:30 PM and it was busy with trivia night. Started out well with getting our drinks quick and placed our order. Food came out pretty quick and was good. However our waitress never came back after that. Did I mention NEVER?  We attempted to flag her down several times to no avail. After half an hour my family just got up and left. I left the table and went to stand by the door figured she would notice the empty table and for ten minutes I just stood waiting. I finally went and asked someone else for my tab and to talk to a manager. They gave me my tab and the manger said \"sorry. We are short staffed and weren't planing on being this busy.\"  I explained that we could have left without paying since no one even paid attention to us for so long. She just said that she was glad we didn't. 

She didn't even offer a discount off our tab, a free meal next time or anything. Just \"oh well sorry.\"  This is no way to keep customers coming back. I know we won't step foot in there again."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Service was okay. I was looking forward to trying this place out, but was disappointed. The food tasted frozen and like it was just reheated. The service was very poor in the fact that it took an hour for our food to come out when we were 1 of 4 groups in the place. The server didn't refill our drinks. Just disappointed. There is such a great opportunity to be successful and have a great reputation with your location."}
{"text":"Came here to watch some football on Sunday and its your typical bar.  Nothing special kind of one of those places where you feel like been here, done that even if it's your first time. Nothing terrible just over all standard bar food and service.  I can see myself coming back out of convenience."}
{"text":"Pb&j wings dogg... thank me later... dont say \"eww\" until you try it.. this shit so good.... if u bust a fat one, thats your problem."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here twice and each time we have really enjoyed the food and atmosphere. I had the chicken quesadillas (but they forgot the chicken and ran it back to the kitchen and added it). My husband had their grilled buffalo chicken salad and had loved it. Their queso, guac and salsa trio dip is so good. The guac you could tell was very fresh as it had chunks of avocado in it. We have also had the green chili Mac and cheese and the green chili bread bowl which were both phenomenal and bursting with flavors. It is a bar so Friday and Saturday nights can be very loud and service not as quick, but still a fun and great place to be!"}
{"text":"This place rocks....  great drink specials are awesome. ....  bar staff is hottt...  Stephanie is the best bartender out there...  good drinks an always let's me know what the specials are....and she's pretty cute. ...  they just got a new menu the rocks....  try the Hangar Flyer Sandwich an get your frequent Flyer card...  9th one is free....."}
{"text":"Love this place! All the waitresses here are welcoming and helpful. The real draw though is pop culture bingo on Wednesday nights at 7pm with Mike Simpson!

Dude is such a great host.

I go with family every week, and they treat their regulars very well. Great place to chill and have some fun especially with a group of people."}
{"text":"We came here on a weekday night and really enjoyed our time. The staff was all nice and the beers were a good price and large. 

Our friend ordered the buffalo skins and was kind enough to let us give them a try. They were really good. Keep in mind it is bar food... but I'd order them again! 

Worth a trip in."}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood spot close to me.  The customer service is always great and parking is never a problem.  They have lots of t.v.'s for sports fans and even a large patio!  I haven't had much luck with their food. It's just been average at best."}
{"text":"A very good locals place to go. Owner is very VERY hands on, and will make sure everything is going well. Recently included live music. Good rotation of craft beers."}
{"text":"The place is busy enough to still have fun and enjoy yourself. Food is perfect now and Stephanie makes the whole thing come together! Love her!"}
{"text":"Not so Happy Hour.  Why are wine drinkers sad at Hangar 9 ??? Because they don't offer HH prices on wine.  Wingers are over priced for what you get."}
{"text":"Nice bar, clean. Good place to go especially late night. They have outside activities and TVs for entertainment, very good craft beer selection."}
{"text":"There is nothing really great about this place. The food was mediocre, the bartender was very unfriendly, and the tables are laid out way too close together. Also very unimpressive Bloody Mary. The patio was nice though."}
{"text":"The food is above average bar food. (Try the rattler bites).  Some of their nightly special's are very good.  Some of the staff is incredible! Great tv's! Nice patio for the smokers."}
{"text":"Simply not a bad thing on the menu.  Great portion sizes reasonable prices friendly super cool bartenders and staff.  Great place to watch sports."}
{"text":"Great food and the best drink prices in Chandler. The environment is clean and the wait staff works their butts off. This is a little hidden gem in a quiet strip mall. Check out their daily specials too!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour spot! We sat at a high top to watch the World Series and ordered cheap beer and wine, $3/pint/glass

HH is 3PM - 7PM, $6 each for the apps and were fan of all of them! We shared these below among the 4 of us.

Wings - hot and spicy, good crispy wings! 1lb was only $6
Tater tots - loaded with green onions, cheese, sour cream and bacon...yummy!
Nachos - a little light on the toppings for me but still good
Buffalo skins - potato skins but with a twist, stuffed with buffalo chicken, it was different

Our friend tried a salad too and she enjoyed it, w/red vinaigrette on the side. Lots of big screens to watch sports and they had hockey on too. We went on a Tuesday night and they were having Trivia night as well. Lots of space and good energy. Our server was good she just got slammed due to the game and HH.

We will come here again!"}
{"text":"Go see Stan. Honestly, I'm a bartender and he's the best I've had in a good long while. Great service, and an incredible personality. He knows his beer and he takes care of his patrons. Attentive, and reliable. This is the first time I've been here and I'm highly impressed. 

Haven't had a chance to try the food only cause we came later in the night but we had such a wonderful evening time. You can sneak and drink on the patio and absorb that honest dicey pub feel without to much harshness, or you can hang inside and grab a gastropub vibe. 

This place is an awesome spot. Worth a potentially out of the way drive. So much fun, and great specials for all the football viewers!"}
{"text":"Fiania and Marianna were amazing! First time coming here and everyone was attentive and efficient. Great prices here and fun bar games :)"}
{"text":"Good food and average service.  Really, really loud though.  We will go back once in a while for a change from our regular places."}
{"text":"Hanger 9 Bar & Grill in Chandler... I stopped in for lunch, first I was greeted by server we were seated in booth, I noticed the place was clean the lady that waited on us was very nice and friendly ...Which made us feel especially welcome..Best part of all was the food was great and the prices was a good value.. They also have Live entertainment so we will be back ...Another diamond in the ruff ..You've got to check this place out.. Bm"}
{"text":"Great local spot to watch games, eat and enjoy some music. The staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"This review is solely based off of the service of Reena. 


She's RUDE every time we come in. She doesn't even bother to greet us - not a \"hello\" or \"how are you\"... just \"what can I get for you?\" With a frown and eye roll. 

Food and drinks come out correctly for the most part  - which is important - but her customer service/friendliness are LITERALLY NON EXISTENT. It doesn't matter if she has 2 or 10 tables - we're always treated as though we're an inconveniences/burden. 

She \"cut off\" my 100% SOBER (DD) sister in law last weekend, (AS SOON AS WE ENTERED THE BUILDING) because she had trouble (stumbled) while moving  a 50lb table to accommodate our party size. 

Again, regarding the above mentioned issue - she didn't even greet our party - she walked up to the MEN in the party (who had been drinking) and told them that the ONLY woman in our group (THE DESIGNATED DRIVER) couldn't be served because \"SHE'S CLEARLY INTOXICATED\". 
She walked away without offering menus or drinks to anyone in the party."}
{"text":"Love this place. I work close so I am there a lot and the staff is very friendly and always go out of their way to say hi."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our food here. Got the happy hour caprese and it was excellent for just $3! The mozzarella tasted so fresh. We also got the wings. It was a Wednesday so it was wing day on special for $.69 each, which really isn't even that great of a deal. They were pretty good and really big wings. We also have gotten the Philly cheesesteak and that was amazing. My husband kept saying how great the bread was and also that the fries were some of his favorites! He was also super excited they had his favorite beer! I got a vodka drink that was super weak. I think this place would do a lot better if they put more of the apps along with the wings on happy hour. Also they nickel and dime you when asking for ranch or side of Jalapeños etc. hate that! All and all this place has pretty good food for pretty good prices and will definitely go back. If they make some minor changes I'll update my review."}
