{"text":"Roast beef was amazing that sandwich alone will bring me back again before I leave Vegas.  I didn't care for the pizza I've had better.  But that sandwich was easily one of the best I've had.  I ordered a pizza, chips and drink and the roast beef sandwich for about $20.  The veggie sandwich is around $8 is also great. And the BLT is good as well."}
{"text":"JJ's is in Paris and made it real convenient during my last stay in LV. I really liked this meat croissant thing they had. Almost like a piroshky...can't remember exactly what it was but it was super good especially as a snack during the long drive back to LA."}
{"text":"It totally slipped my mind to review JJ's after my vegas trip. The weird thing is that I skipped over the pastries and ordered a bagel with smoked salmon on top. At $10 it's definitely overpriced, but it was delicious and surprisingly enough I was full after finishing it. Considering the price of food in general on the Strip, I'd say JJ's is worth considering for a nice change of pace for breakfast."}
{"text":"If I could give a zero..I would. Worst effin workers here I've experienced since moving to Vegas..I kid u not. First they don't get my order right. Then when I get my sandwich I noticed it was dry...it was supposed to be with Dijon mustard as advertised. At first I thought ok no problem, let me just ask for some on the side. When I ask for it..the lady had no idea what I was saying. Pointing to the breads and saying sandwich....don't know how u mistake that for Dijon mustard. So after 5 minutes of trying to explain to her what it is and going through mayo and other condiments that I wasn't talking about, she finally says she just makes the sandwiches...umm..o..k..obviously not how described in the menu...then my girlfriend asks for her rolls they forgot to give her...so I go to another worker who hopefully speaks a bit of English if I can get it and she say says \"she didn't give it to u?\" No...that's why I'm standing here waiting like an idiot. Then my girl asks if she can get her pizza warmed up and the girl says we can't its against policy...my girl wasn't having it and thankfully the chef heard and told her of course u can just put it in the oven! In a tone where it seemed like he wanted to call her a jackass. Any way ..stay away from this place..they can't prepare a sandwich like they describe and what they did make was horrible..pizza was bleu...just don't go here...walk FAR AWAY!  ."}
{"text":"Have come here the last few years for the prosciutto sandwich.  They changed it,  I was disappointed.  They don't have the little pickles anymore!  It was the best part. The bread was hard and I had a tough time biting it without cutting the inside of my mouth. Balsamic glaze is really good,  they could've used more in it.  Arugula was fresh.  Ok quality of prosciutto,  but a lot of fat on it. Definitely not worth $14, but I had resort credits so it worked out.  I would say it's just OK."}
{"text":"Two Words... Vanilla Eclair!!  Never leave Vegas without having one or three.... My husband took a trip to Vegas and I had him bring me back a dozen!!!  Yup, that good!!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food and mediocre service at a high price.  Hostess was very slow seating customers and spent more time socializing with her coworkers than on seating customers. $23 for a breakfast buffet is a price more like the George V in the real Paris for a cup of coffee and a croissant.  Not the place to go if u r in a hurry and want decent food. This was Hampton Inn quality food at a premium price. Not so bad if u r not in a hurry and want to stuff urself, however."}
{"text":"The sandwiches at JJ's are pretty good with fresh bread and ingredients.  However, it  takes so long to get your order.  Expect to wait at least 15-20 minutes.  While I appreciate the attention put into making my sandwich, please speed up the process!  And even in all the time the ladies took to make my sandwich, they included onions when I specifically asked for none.  I will probably be back to JJ's because we frequent the Paris Hotel and Casino, but I will keep my fingers crossed that they hire more efficient sandwich makers."}
{"text":"I love, love, love their pizza! They have a 2 slice w/sode special for $9.99, I get it evry time I'm in vegas. You can order any of their specialty pizza in this deal. This is great for you if you don't want to feel stuffed frm a buffet. I also like the location, there is  patio style seating, I usually sit here & people watch. Great for relaxing after losing your $ :-("}
{"text":"Very expensive for what you get.  If you stay in Paris hotel you get 9$ to spend in the bakery.  In good case is enough to regular coffee and small brownie. If you want to be so expensive at least bring more quality food.  Not recommended."}
{"text":"While staying at Paris Hotel, we stopped in here for breakfast. This one is down a little side hallway and is MUCH BETTER than the other little french shop they have that is right by the casino part. I ordered a waffle with strawberries and mascarpone cheese, which was very good. My boyfriend ordered a turkey breast sandwich that was supposed to be on a different bread, but he asked to get the french bread instead (I would highly recommend, because their bread is really good!). It is a little expensive, but most restaurants around the area are. However, there is plenty of seating and is quieter because it is back a little farther from the loud casino."}
{"text":"great for people watching or sitting with a drink while waiting to be seated at le provenal.  the gelato is refreshing but the food is on the junk food side. service is slow."}
{"text":"I used to come here every year, but this yes I got a bit disappointed with some services they don't offer anymore and the employees (from the kitchen) were such in a bad mood, almost rude I'd say."}
{"text":"Stopped here in our hotel for some great reuben sandwiches. They were made fresh and tasted very good. The tables that you could eat at were quite messy and had not been cleared off very well. The garbages were also overflowing. They need to get on some basic housekeeping!"}
{"text":"Worst system ever. Avoid at breakfast time. Totally messed up our order. Waited over 50 mins for food. Over priced for terrible food. $9 for a peanut butter sandwich!!!"}
{"text":"Very european, friendly staff and yet professional...prosciutto sandwich was my favorite!! took me back to Europe..."}
{"text":"Good pizza, very large slices. When I went it was something like $10.00 for two slices (which had to be stacked on top of one-another to fit on the plate), and a drink. They also have good gelato, at reasonable prices (relative to Vegas).   It probably won't blow your socks off, but if you want to grab something simple and fairly cheap for lunch, this is a good option."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in here before seeing an afternoon show at the Paris for something quick to eat.   We shared an order of the roast beef sandwich with cheddar cheese and a vanilla napolean. It was both a large sandwich and a large dessert, so sharing wasn't a problem. If we had both eaten an individual serving of each, it would have been too much to handle.   The best thing about the sandwich was the incredible bread, it was chewy and crispy at the same time. The napolean was also very tasty with a good mix of creamy filling and flaky, thin waferlike layers.   The price for everything came to about $20, which is not crazy expensive, but not thrifty either."}
{"text":"Before waiting in line for the hotel's breakfast Buffet, I went here for a cafe au lait.  The decor is trying to look like a boulangerie and pâtisserie, but really doesn't pull it off well.  It's a typical cafeteria style experience.  But, I was only looking for a drink to kick-start my morning and the cafe au lait was delish!"}
{"text":"The service is terribly slow unless you are getting pizza and was under staffed. Although the sandwiches were actually tasty, especially the Italian Deli Sandwich."}
{"text":"I discovered JJ's Boulangerie a few years ago during one of my stays at Paris and now I look forward to eating here every time I'm back in Vegas. It's the perfect cafe to grab a quick breakfast or lunch during the day. There's a huge assortment of pastries, danishes, breads and coffees to choose from, with the cherry-cheese danish being my favorite. It gets crowded though, so be prepared to fight for a table."}
{"text":"stopped here because we were starvingggg. overpriced. horrible customer service and not so great food. I ordered the cured meat sandwich, it was mediocre and basic nothing special.  definitely wouldnt recommend this place."}
{"text":"I ordered the bacon, egg and cheddar croissant sandwich and quite frankly, it was the best breakfast sandwich I've ever had in my life! The croissant was fresh, buttery and crisp on the outside. The bacon was perfectly crisp and not too thick or thin. And the cheese was there, but it didn't overwhelm the sandwich. It was perfect and I will be back here for breakfast every time I come to Vegas."}
{"text":"The banana chocolate tart was not  too sweet and the chocolate & sugar decoration was crispy."}
{"text":"I don't care how good the food is, if the employees have shitty attitudes then they fail. Someone told me \"They're French; it's part of their of culture.\" That's bullshit."}
{"text":"Locate in Paris Casino is a casual quick eats type of cafe.   Filled with Pastries, Baked Goods, Hot & Cold Sandwiches,Pizza whole or by the slice, soup and salads.They take out window for pizza which is great for a the fast bite. I stopped in for a breakfast pastry and coffee, prices reasonable and relaxing atmosphere.  No waiter service and seating available inside and out."}
{"text":"Simply, amazing! We had the tuna and the roast beef sandwiches and while there was a big line, it went by real fast. The sandwiches themselves were probably the best of each we ever had; and all very reasonably, too. The service was quick and very courteous. The biere wasn't bad, either. Quite affordable, too. All in all, we loved our late lunch here."}
{"text":"For some reason I continue to pick up sandwiches here, although they're overpriced and bland.  Stand in line and get a crepe, go to the buffet, try the burger place, or just go somewhere else!!!"}
{"text":"This place is so overpriced it's ridiculous. The pizza prices are okay but the drinks and everything else. I bought a water and a juice and it was 9 bucks. My sister waited forever for her pizza only to be told they didn't have it after having her wait. They also run out of pizza so fast and after a long while they only had magherita."}
{"text":"This is an acceptable place to go for a casual quick meal when everything else is closed.  They do serve cold bottles of beer if you need one.   The wait for us on a Wednesday night was a few minutes but not bad.  I don't mind waiting a bit so that my sandwich hasn't been sitting wrapped in plastic for a few hours.  The beef dip sandwich was pretty good.  I highly recommend their pastries.  We had two different ones ($6 each) and shared them and they were as good as they looked."}
{"text":"I can't understand how this place functions. Everyone there has a HORRIBLE attitude. Service isn't that great, and they are nasty people towards customers. I will never return to this establishment, and would not recommend this place to anyone. By far, one of the worst places I've experienced in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This European style cafe is located in the Paris Casino along the walk way. I've been here several times over the years and have always been pleased. It's perfect for times when you want something casual.  They have an outside window to order slices of pizza. When it was my turn to order, I changed my mind and wanted the clam chowder in the French bread bowl. The lady was nice and put my order in and told me to step inside to pick it up. The clam chowder in the bread bowl was the BEST I ever had!! The soup was delicious filled with chunks of clams in a creamy and smooth soup. The bread top and insides of the bread were warmed and lightly toasted making it perfect to dip in my soup. It was wonderful to have on a cold winter night.   This place also has a nice selection of hot and cold sandwiches, pastries, soups and salads.  The sandwiches are made with their delicious French bread and stuffed with meat. I recommend the chicken salad, it is yummy.  This is also the perfect place to grab a breakfast pastry and cup of coffee. The place is clean, the service is good, and the price is reasonable."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch I chose the 8\" Italian Sub toasted, the bread was incredibly fresh, crusty with just the perfect amount of chewiness. The toppings were absolutely fresh and the lady working the counter on the bakery side made one of the best subs I've had in a long time, I was only able to consume half of this hearty sandwich but struggled to leave the other half but hey I'm in Vegas and I'm not taking a doggie bag, unfortunately I should of but didn't wrap it up and offer it to one of the many homeless or panhandlers on the strip. My associate tried the pizza and said it was just alright I guess it's all about making the right choices, even the restaurants in Vegas is a gamble sometimes..."}
{"text":"On Sunday May 13th, my daughter and I arrived to the Paris hotel for a much anticipated 3 night mother's day getaway. Check in went well. The room was clean. We had a great time exploring the hotel, pool and gambling.  We walked past JJ's earlier in the day and the pizza smelled great. That evening for dinner we decided to stop at the window to grab a couple of slices to bring back to our room.  The window agent wasn't there and as we waited a line began to form behind us. The agent (Teresa) walked past telling us to go inside. We approached the register and waited when we noticed that Teresa was helping the gentleman that was behind us farther down the counter. So we went down there. She brought his selections to the same register we had been waiting at and then began assisting people that began to line up, again that had been behind us. For a 2nd time Teresa walked past us telling us go over there.  When it was our turn in line, we mentioned to Teresa that we didn't think it was fair that she kept telling us to go over here or there and helping other people in front of us. She claimed she didn't do that when she absolutely had. We asked to speak with Teresa's manager and she  said she would call a manager. While waiting her coworker \"Katrina\" sharply said : oh its mothers day and some people just want to complain\". I asked her to repeat herself because I was astonished that this employee would be so rude to a customer. She said \"I wasn't talking to you I was talking to my friend.  We have to work on mothers day and  I feel sorry for you being in a bad mood while some people have to work.\"  I was completely taken aback.  I was already frustrated with the back and forth about the line and Katrina was just making a bad situation worse. My daughter told Katrina to stop talking to us because she could tell that Katrina was just making a bad situation worse.  The woman behind me in line asked me what was happening and I told her. Katrina yelled that I should \"get out of line and go wait over there and stop complaining to her guests\". Shortly after, Frank a manager from another area came over and asked what was going on. We explained the situation. he apologized and asked if we wanted to file a report. I told him i just wanted him to be aware because I personally have spent over 35 years in the customer service field, my current position is  Director of Toursim and if one of my employees would have spoken with a guest that way i would have immediately sent them home while the situation was investigated. Frank assured me that they would investigate and even brought me to another area to file a report. I asked if this was just a waste of my time and he assured me it wasn't. I'm not sure what transpired but i do know that Katrina was still working at the restaurant as we saw her when we walked past. i was not contacted again by management during  my stay despite filling out a report with my phone number and room number. I am very disappointed in the service and lack of follow up by your management staff."}
{"text":"Late at night service is slow even without being busy. Tables were not clea my sandwich was mediocre"}
{"text":"So the sandwiches here are fantastic. Was in town for the weekend for a girlfriends wedding and stayed at the Paris. We ate JJ's sandwiches twice as we really enjoyed them the first day when we swung by during the slow time of the day and grabbed a late bite.   That bring said, our second experience here was nowhere near as positive as our first. The bakery was packed as it was lunch hour so understandably there was going to be more of a wait. 35 minutes for a cold sandwich is a little extreme though, especially considering my friend who ordered her hot sandwich at the same time as I got hers about 20 minutes before I did. Multiple people who ordered after me had eaten and left by the time I was given my lunch, which I only received after asking what the eta was.. They had lost my order. Then made my sandwich but threw it out before even offering it to me as they made it wrong. And then, when I finally did receive it, it looked completely different than it had the day before, even though I ordered the same thing.   I would chalk it up as a mistake seeing as I have worked it the service industry and I understand that happens. Problem was, I was 1 of about 10 people who waited an exceptionally lengthy amount of time for their food, just to watch people who ordered way after us leaving with their meals in hand.   JJ's has great food but don't come starving and expect to be patient. They sandwich line is incredibly unorganized and while the chefs are friendly enough, the food is not consistent. Lost orders, orders made incorrectly and a lot of confusion behind the counter are going to be on the menu if you decide to come during the lunchtime rush."}
{"text":"pathetic eclair. shame to be in a french hotel"}
{"text":"A good alternative if the buffet line at the Paris has your stomach in knots at the wait time. We got a large pizza with 3 or so toppings for $25 out the door. Very shareable among 3-4 people. This alternative is very much cheaper per head than the buffet, let's just say that.  But not nearly as good. It's a fix of calories. I'd probably avoid dinnertime and see what they have to offer for breakfast and lunch as the place really is a bakery, and from the menu seemed to be teem with French delicacies ranging from croissants to specialty sandwiches.  Hilarious anecdote: if you see a cash register technician named Aziza, tell her I said hi. In no fewer than 3 questions I tried to find out what nationality she was. The answers started out with \"Europe\" and ended at \"Eastern Europe\". Maybe it's company policy to not let your clients know you aren't French.  However, Albania and France are known to have warm relations.  http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files_156/albania_359/france-and-albania_6103/index.html"}
{"text":"Great little place for a quick bite. Faster than table service but slower than fast food. The turkey & Swiss was excellent. The baguette was my favorite so fresh and perfect.  The pastry was delicious as well.   This is inside the Paris casino/hotel.  I only wish we had checked this place out a day earlier for breakfast!"}
{"text":"We had the pepperoni pizza slices and hot turkey sandwich with A vanilla Napoleon. The pizza bread was thin with a thick outer crust. My boyfriend commented the chunks of fresh tomatoes was new addition to the traditional pepperoni pizza. The crust was sweet to taste.  The hot turkey sandwich was delicious. The Napoleon vanilla filling tasted different to me. Maybe I was expecting sweeter or maybe more vanilla flavor. So I rated the food lower.   This is a place you walk up, buy the food then find a table. Many of the tables were unclean after people left. So be prepared for a slightly dirtier area."}
{"text":"Expensive.   Good croissants.   Marginal service.  There are about a dozen tables.  $3.50 for bottle of water."}
{"text":"Worst service ever, the manager over there is awful, the pizza is ok but the costumer service needs to learn how to talk to a costumer"}
{"text":"Came by here this morning for some breakfast and left JJ's Boulangerie with a full belly and a smile on my face. Ordered the bacon, egg and cheddar croissant sandwich and some steel cut oatmeal. Nothing too difficult, but was everything was exploding with flavor! I know you're probably thinking, oatmeal and a croissant, how could this be so great??? Well, take my word for it. They add some kind of syrup in the oatmeal that gives it a kick ass flavor and the sandwich was absolutely to die for. Give it a shot, you'll definitely love this place like I did.   The only downfall is this place is a bit on the pricey side, but no need to be a cheapskate. Eat here: you'll thank me later! TWO THUMBS UP JJ's!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in a really long time! My husband had the 3 cheese and I had the supreme and they were both fresh and so flavorful. And the crime brûlée was to die for as well."}
{"text":"We came across this place while making our a ay back to Bally's where we were staying.  It's a charming little eatery that reminds me of some of the places that I visited in Paris. They have a wide variety of sandwiches,  pizzas, desserts. We ordered the pepperoni  pizza by the slice. The pieces are large, 1 was enough to fill me up. I was so full I wasn't able to eat dessert which I was looking forward to.  The service was friendly. It was cool to see them making the dough and pizzas by hand right there behind the counter using an old schoolish oven. The crust a was so crispy! The dough was thin, had the perfect amount of cheese, pepperoni, and sauce. We will definitely stop in again, when we're in town. They also offer massive full pies for around  $20 if a bigger group is eating together.  Check this place out!"}
{"text":"We grabbed salads from this place on our way back to our room after shows both nights we were there.  They were good, quick, and the bread rolls at 3 for 99 cents were a great, tasty deal."}
{"text":"We came on a bad day for lunch. It was the 1st day of a brand new menu. After placing our orders at the register we waited for our sandwiches. I ordered the chicken ($10.) and hub ordered the vegetable ($8.). When I asked the cashier what condiments came on the sandwich he replied, \"whatever the menu says is what is on it.\" A little rude but I didn't expect much out of him.   The wait was about 20 minutes. There were 3 employees assembling the orders. It took awhile due to the new menu and they were still getting use to which sandwiches had what on them.   The chicken sandwich was decent. The French baguette was soft and fresh. The chicken was served in small pieces with lettuce and tomato. The chicken didn't have much flavor. I added additional condiments to help it out.  Since the chicken was in small pieces it kept falling out of the bread so eating it wasn't easy. The portion was small for the price. The sandwiches do not come with a side.   They bake all of their bread, pastries and pizza fresh everyday.   Misc. info: No wait staff, seating is open, show your players card for a discount."}
{"text":"Get the gelato: $3 for 1 scoop, $4 for 2 scoops. Giant pizzas, sandwiches, a simple deli, but great food."}
{"text":"Love there turkey sandwich! It's $11 but so fillings and the focaccia bread they use is delicious. If you have a sweet tooth for deep rich chocolate flavor try their chocolate raspberry mousse, it's so smooth and indulgent. The staff are very kind and helpful, even with the most pickiest eaters, they'll make your food to your desires & specifications."}
{"text":"Food is good, but a bit overpriced just like about anything in the strip. I've been here a few times, twice I've asked for an everything bagel they keep giving me a plain bagel, I asked them to switch it the second time. \"But the ticket says plain\" she said... I know but not that's not what I ordered. Sandwiches are delicious, but again pricey. I think the problem is the cashiers are trying to keep the lines moving fast may be the mess up a few orders."}
{"text":"It's an OK place to eat. They have a few beautiful pastries but most of them lack flavor and good taste. Nonetheless it is a pretty busy spot where you can get reasonably priced eats for a quick meal."}
{"text":"I had the \"pizza special\" for dinner here which was two slices and a drink. The margherita pizza was excellent the pepperoni not so much; it was way too greasy and soggy. Had my first slice not been so delicious this definitely would have been a three rating. However! You must try their gelato which tempts you as you order food. I had the coffee flavored gelato and it was absolutely splendid. In short. Food is eh but dessert is delicious!"}
{"text":"They were very slow getting  our order. They used powered  eggs . Ham  was salty. The soft drinks machine  was not turned on."}
{"text":"JJ's is an ok place to grab a sandwich, breakfast or lunch, when you're in a pinch at the Paris-Las Vegas.   I've had their bacon, egg, cheese on croissant a few times while staying at the Paris. It's decent. I think it's like $10.50, which is a bit pricy for the cafeteria type service.   3.25 stars"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch.  Ordered 2 Slices for 9.99.  I had the mushroom and my husband had the Margherita.  The pizza was great!  The slices are thin but not falling apart as thin slices tend to do.    We also ordered 2 Cappucino with a Canoli.  The coffee was amazing but the Canoli wasn't that great.  Perhaps because I was already full from the pizza and that's why I couldn't eat it.  There's also a side where they make fresh sandwiches.  So fresh that I saw the man behind the counter carving Italian ham off of a leg.  Of course as this is a Bakery, they have fresh bread for sale!  Next time I stay here, I'll buy bread and cheese with fruits to have in the room.  I love how quickly and well the ladies behind the counter worked.  Great customer service!  I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"For a quick morning grab or a light afternoon meal, Boulangerie at Paris, Las Vegas is the ideal place. Fresh baked bread, baguettes and other baked delights with butter, jam and desserts here are divine. The folks that work here are a little rude. Perhaps they are trying to make it a truly Parisian experience."}
{"text":"Definitely not Paris in Las Vegas!  Tastes like any Starbucks pastry menu.  Keep looking if you want really good croissants."}
{"text":"We wanted a quick and light place to eat since we plan on going to a buffet for dinner. I was hoping for a breakfast sandwich but they stop serving breakfast items at 11 AM  Ham and gruyere sandwich $11: So I actually ordered the ham and gruyere quiche, and was told it would take 10-12 minutes which was fine. However, when they called out my name for my order we realized that the ham and grueyere sandwich was entered instead. The quiche was $1 more,\" and to their credit they did offer to get it made for me. I just decided to take the sandwich because they already made it and didn't want it to go to waste. The sandwich was a good size, and tasted better with the addition of mayonnaise, salt and pepper.   Small coffee $3.25: They only had self serve coffee here. I wanted an ice coffee so was given a plastic cup to do it myself at the beverage station. It was nice to be able to refill!"}
{"text":"A good place for coffee and french pastries/desserts. FYI.. They charged 50 cent for a cup of water."}
{"text":"The pizza and breakfast crescents were both great. The food prices are very reasonable and the food is so fresh."}
{"text":"Mehhh. Came here for the pizza but they weren't serving any. So we settled for breakfast. Ordered the strawberry waffle and a small drink. 15$. I was expecting the price as it is in a casino on the strip so I understand the pricing. However. The 20 minute wait for the waffle was crazy.   I had to go to the counter and ask the lady if my waffle was ready...she hadn't even pored it in the waffle maker. So I stood there to make sure I got my breakfast.   Once I got it, it was ok. It wasn't mind blowing or worth what I paid for it. The strawberries were fresh but they didn't give enough. I ran out of strawberries not even half way through the waffle. The buttercream they used wasn't all that great either. I wouldn't waste money on this again."}
{"text":"**Disclaimer this is a review about their pizza, not their deserts (which would have probably been delicious haven't we been so hung over) **  Item: Mushroom Pizza (+1) - Fast service (-1) - Gallons of oil on my slice making the crust soggy (-1) - SUPER salty"}
{"text":"Just because you are in Vegas don't expect to wine and dine here.  This is meant to be a quick service restaurant with food to satisfy hunger, not give you the \"wow\" factor.  Had the prosciutto sandwich and it tasted just as I anticipated.  Crusty baguette, prosciutto di parma, mozzarella, arugula, and balsamic.  Simple, fast, and on the go.  The cheese pizza would have used some extra time in the oven because the under crust had gone soggy."}
{"text":"Their salmon sandwich was yummy and only 8 dollars!  It fed my dad and I because we were still having a buffet hangover from the day before with all the food we stuffed into our bodies.  They have good coffee too.  Lines though... but can you really avoid that in Vegas?"}
{"text":"They had a special today that lured us in: 2 slices of pizza & a fountain drink for $9.99. Let me just say, I should've just gotten a crepe next door instead. The pizza is not great here. Costco pizza is a million times better than this crap. Stay clear, unless you're drunk AF and don't care."}
{"text":"Busy but the line goes fast. I had a provolone and prosciutto sandwich with arugula on a baguette. It was mediocre. Not bad but was room for improvement.  Their pizza seems to be a hit. Wish i would have tried that instead.  There are a slew of great looking desserts so enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came for a mid morning snack. Coffee and a croissant in a French bakery. Fail. Long line. Limited menu. No prices listed for bakery items. Ordered a small coffee and a chocolate croissant, bill was just under $8. I asked them to warm the pastry and was told to take it to the other counter. The person burned my pastry and didn't even say anything. She sent another person back to the first counter to get a replacement and never bothered to even acknowledge or apologize. Coffee was very weak. One soda machine was broken. I would suggest the Aria bakery for a coffee and croissant, way better."}
{"text":"Prime Rib of Beef Sandwich with Caramelized Onions, Gruyere, & Horseradish Sauce is life. I love sandwiches on Baguettes so I'm here all the time. It's pricey, but the quality of the ingredients are quite high. Pro Tip: The Chef Salad is amazing as well."}
{"text":"First off WOO HOO VEGAS!   Now with that said this place if Effin Hell for food!  It was a group of 10 girls we had stayed at different hotels and decided to meet at Paris for our final stop. We decided to munch here what a big NO NO! So we looked at the menu and I decided to get the Chicken Parmesan sandwich. Well I paid, and went to the sandwich station and saw that on my receipt said chicken salad sandwich. I went back to the cashier explained to her that I wanted Chicken Parmesan she then corrected it, and put Turkey sandwich. So I told the sandwich ladies \"Hey no! I want Chicken Parmesan\"  What does she do! she gets the chicken salad and starts working on that. \"HELLO! NO that's not what I want\" She said \" You want it in a wrap\"..lol \"No, I want  Chicken Parmesan\"  \" I don't know what that is\"  \"should I take a picture of the menu\" I asked. my friend next to me was having the same problem.   I finally received a half-ass sandwich with just chicken onions and lettuce!... after paying $12 that's all I received.after all this my friend was still waiting I finished my sandwich she was still waiting! finally they gave her the sandwich. She complained, manager did nothing about it. She had to argue with him to give her her Money back! NEVER AGAIN! Everyone in my group had a problem except those who got the pizza.  I'm not kidding after this AMAZING service and DELICIOUS sandwich I was still hungry, angry, and annoyed!"}
{"text":"We always stay at Paris hotel and this is just a convenient place to get something without sitting in. The food is great but the service is beyond horrible from the cooks. The cashiers are friendly and nice and fast, but then they put the orders in and it goes to the cooks it's another story! The cooks are rude and very slow. It's like they hate their jobs and don't want to be there helping others in a hotel in Vegas that lives on hospitality."}
{"text":"Literally ate here everyday during my last visit. I used to only get breakfast here because the breads are made fresh, the prices are cheap for being on the strip and service is fast. This past time I came after lunch hours and late night. Sandwiches are amazing, I tried almost every one, the stars are for the Italian. Pizza is ok great deal at $9 for two slices and a drink. I'm disappointed that they no longer offer juices at breakfast, who wants to drink soda at 7am?"}
{"text":"The pizza is ehhhhh.  the sandwiches sound cool but also ehhh. the bread is something you'd need to get used to.  I don't really know about this place. It's just okay to me as it could definitely have some great potential here but I just don't know what's missing!"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick and healthy bite...well, if you choose healthy, that is.  Freshly baked French baguette, croissants, sourdough, pastries and put-mor- junk-in- the-trunk caramelized cream puffs...yikes!  The $10 or so sandwiches were delicious.  We all shared the yummy \"communal\" turkey, caprese, smoked salmon and tuna.  The greek salad ($10) was not bad.  I felt bad for the only person making the sandwiches.  She was quick, but the line started to form after us.    We'd go here again!"}
{"text":"So, I stopped in here today with some family and let me tell you, the desserts are amazing! We got three desserts and split them, because why only get one when we could get three??  By far, the pistachio cake slice was everyone's favorite by far. The raspberry,chocolate mousse cake was super rich, perfect for you chocolate lovers out there. The tiramisu was my second favorite, but I launched a piece of the chocolate bowl across the table when I tried to break a piece off (Maybe it was a sign to lay off the sweets), so it was like  a snack and a show.  The only thing is that none of the desserts weren't labeled so when we got to the cashier we had to have her walk back to the case with us to ask what everything was (she wasn't even sure herself of the names or prices)and their coffee is pretty pricey at $4 for drip coffee, but that isn't too surprising on  the Strip. Service was ok, but the desserts were excellent!"}
{"text":"I was staying at the Paris and I went into this place to get a sandwich.  I wasn't expecting much from a little store inside Paris, but the sandwich was really good.  I'll definitely go back when I'm hungry in the Paris."}
{"text":"Acceptable bakery if you are willing to put up with the negative customer experience. The food isn't so good that it is worth it. The cashier taking your order was very angry and aggressive about people having their id. This wasn't an issue for us but her overall negative attitude just made it rather unpleasant to work with her. Then she got my order wrong (she charged me for something that was $10 instead of $1.50) which I didn't notice until after my mother had already swiped her credit card. There was this huge ordeal about having to get the manager. The whole time she was extremely rude even though she had been the one to make the mistake and was wasting our time.    I thought I would give this place a try since there is a long line here, which I foolishly assumed meant the food was good. I think the long line is just because a lot of people get breakfast vouchers here. We got a fruit tart, which was priced at $5.50 and seemed reasonable for Vegas and the location. I also got some rolls that were super cheap at 3 for $1.50. The food was unremarkable but definitely acceptable. Two stars because the food is fine but I would never come here again."}
{"text":"Sometimes it can be tough to find a decent quick bite in a casino as they tend to push formal sit down resturants, crappy buffets or really bad fast food. Located in Paris Las Vegas, this place has quality fresh made sandwiches, pizza, salads and sweets to grab."}
{"text":"Started with French Onion soup that cost $6.50/piece and tastes like it's from a can. Went to cashier asking for refund. She had to call for a manager. Next ordered a whole cheese pizza for the family. It tasted pretty good. Liked the dough and the cheese was bubble and cooked right. 3 out of 5 stars. Sodas are $3/piece. Took 40 minutes for a manager to show up and refund the $13 plus tax for the soups. The manager did apologize."}
{"text":"Looooong wait for pizza.....hard to find a table.  Expensive pizza as well.  They charge 50 cents for water after I paid over $25 for a pizza!!!"}
{"text":"(+) - large slices - lower prices  (~) - combination pizza  (-) - rock hard crust  If you need a cheap quick bite to eat and are too lazy to venture outside to get something, the 2 slices of pizza and a fountain drink for 10 dollars is probably the best deal you'll find in the Paris Hotel. They really need to add a food court of some sort in there....  I was looking for something substantial to fill my stomach for a low price and didn't want to have a dinner of just pastries (though i was tempted...)  Since every place I looked, including this one, was charging at least 10 dollars for a salad or a sandwich, me and my friend decided to split this deal.  I got a slice of combination pizza which was large but probably only halfway covered with toppings. The toppings were heavy in mushrooms with most of it densely packed in the front 1/3 of the pizza. It tasted not too bad until I hit the crust which was rock hard. Im guessing the pizzas are inconsistent as well since my other friends got  the combo slice the next day and it looked totally different.  The pizza is meh, but a good deal compared to your other options."}
{"text":"The beautiful desserts displayed in the case had me fooled that the meal was going to be good. I had a prime rib beef sandwich. The bread was good, but the meat was so greasy I could not eat it. The horseradish went well, but I wished there was more of it. I doubt I will return here to give something else a try. The only reason I would is because it's on the low end of prices for food inside Ballys and Paris."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and it's still the same quaint bakery. The BLT, prime rib and ham sandwiches are on point and delicious. The prices aren't that bad, except $5 for a Naked juice. But compared to the rest of the Strip food joints I think quality is maintained at JJ's boulangerie."}
{"text":"So I paid $12 for a sub-par turkey wrap, a cup of clam chowder, and a small drink. I ended up here because the buffet line across the hall was too damn long and my friends and I were hungry. The turkey wrap was kinda small, with basically just lettuce, turkey, and I guess some bacon bits. The cup of clam chowder was typical decent clam chowder, but I'm a fan of clam chowder in general so I liked it. I honestly think all their stuff is overpriced, but it does the job. I'd take my business elsewhere though."}
{"text":"We had pepperoni pizza and a dessert tart. They were both delicious. The pizza was fresh and warm, I really enjoyed the crust, it was crispy and not too thick. The prices were very reasonable for the quality of the food. There were specials listed on a board outside. I enjoyed the dessert tart and I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Went in for a quick bite. The prosciutto sandwich for lunch was not bad. The bread was soft and chewy.  Prosciutto is not bad. Didn't like the sweet glaze sauce on it. A little too sweet for me. Tried the chocolate Eclair based on other reviews.  not very good. Took a bite and Threw it away. The pastry itself was dry and not flaky."}
{"text":"Aside from the lame service and how slow you get the food and how you have to fight for tables...  The french onion soup wasn't too salty which I like.    The proscuitto sammie was actually quite delicious.  The proscuitto was full of that sweet cured taste and the provolone was mildly piquant.    The pizza tasted pretty good.  But by then I was starting to feel the affects of the alcomoholllllllllllllllll  The salad was crisp and fresh.  And I think my friend yacked a little somewhere in the restaurant.  Sorry."}
{"text":"I was impressed with the massive sandwiches they put out here. I've paid as much or more for sandwiches in Seattle that pale in comparison. The Italian sandwich was excellent. It reminded me of a sandwich I had in Rome last year and the Hot Pastrami tasted like I smoked the meat myself in my smoker. The pile of smoked pastrami was so big, I could only eat half the sandwich and I was hungry after a six mile walk. The sandwich included peppercorns and chips too. That was a nice touch. The restaurant is on the nice Paris rue walkway to the Mirage and was authentically decorated. They offer little Creme Brule cups just like I buy at the bakery at the bakery in the Moulin Rouge district of Paris every morning while I'm there. I was impressed with the quality of the sandwiches and the feel of this place. It actually reminded me of being in Paris so that was a bonus for me."}
{"text":"Stopped here twice during our stay. Located right in the heart of the indoor walkway between Bally's and Paris. Good place to get a quick bite offering a variety of pizza, sandwiches, daily soup, dessert/pastries, gelato, breakfast, coffee.  Bread made on premises. The pizza was decent but would be better if crust wasn't so brittle and dry. They have a special 2 slices (any kind) with soda $9.99. Chocolate gelato was non edible and  GROSS! Pastries looked good but didn't try. Tip: our experience was if you don't ask them to heat up pizza they will just serve it to you cold/room temperature!"}
{"text":"Great place for a French Croissant breakfast sandwich!  I ordered a Bacon, Egg and Cheese Croissant.  Not sure if real French people made it, but it was fun to go here and be in \"Paris\" for breakfast!  And the calories from the croissant sandwich helped keep me full until lunchtime! ;D"}
{"text":"Quick order no lines. The cashiers were very nice. 2 family members got the prime rib sandwich and Italian sandwich on ciabatta. They loved it.   Mom and I got the pizza special 2 slices and a drink for $9.99  We tried the wild mushroom and margherita and they were wonderful in flavor and thickness but they were cold. That's why I took off a star but overall for cheap easy food it was good"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a late lunch here yesterday.  It was quite good.  She has the Prime Rib sandwich and I had the Italian sandwich. We also shared a New England Clam Chowder.  Everything was fantastic.  If there was 1 thing I didn't like was I though the water was over priced. A small bottle of Fiji water was $4, but heck, look where we were at, not that unexpected.  If we are at this casino again, we will probably stop by again."}
{"text":"Inside the Paris Hotel.  This place has the best BLT sandwich ever!  It's about $12.00 and its huge!  The bread is fresh, garlicy mayo is tasty, and of course thick crisp bacon.  Their ceasar sald is also a good choice, but you have to pay for a roll with it.  All food is made fresh to order, so it can take some time.  My salad came out incorrectly and they happily remade it.  Good location if you are at Paris or Bally's."}
{"text":"Bad service, overpriced, and they screwed up the food after a long wait. We asked for our money back."}
{"text":"Super cheap, especially for a Vegas hotel!   My friends and I were looking for some nosh while waiting for the whole gang to be there before going to dinner. We stopped in JJ's to grab something light, and it hit the spot. I got the cheese/fruit plate, which wasn't anything spectacular, but paired it with a French roll which was fresh and fabulous.  This place is a good spot for a quick snack."}
{"text":"The bread is awful. No holes in the bread. Like what happens when I buy frozen bread and don't proof it correctly.   Doesn't matter b/c of their foot traffic and volume.   Their other products are good. Great at the sugar desserts and pastries. Anything with sugar doesn't need proofing. Just has to look good and be sweet.   What would a native French person think?   Still... better than most places on the strip."}
{"text":"If you want sandwiches walk a little further and try the best in Vegas @ PH's Earl of Sandwich. I guess the English IS better than the French after all!!! Here, the Sandwiches were OK (my Friend's order)!! I ordered the French Onion Soup. Was looking forward to it but was disappointed that it took 20 minutes to pour out of their bucket into their paper cups!! Service, presentation and food were not good!! love the Paris buffet across!!"}
{"text":"Mehhhhhh, I remember sitting here and quickly reviewing some of the reviews and quick tips and someone mentioned this spot reminded them of Epcot in Orlando and that was totally what I was thinking. It's really nothing special in the least.  We needed something quick and we figured a sandwich from here would do the job. I checked out the menu and wanted the chicken sandwich that was listed but when I got to the register they only chicken they had was Caesar... I said ok, well can I just get the chicken but without the Caesar dressing. And I actually got a \"no\" - it is pre made that way. I was so turned off at this point that I just went with a basic BLT.  When I opened it up, the bacon was undercooked, there was little to no lettuce and the tomato were sun dried, which was listed that way, but just didn't agree with my taste buds with everything else added to it. It was really just all bread with terrible filling.   Overall just a really lousy spot when you are surrounded by so many better options!"}
{"text":"In terms of food in Vegas, this isn't buffet, but if I come to Paris hotel, I either go here or to the Creperie.   Their pizza is usually very good, and they have a great deal (two slices and a soda). The place isn't much to look at, it almost feels like you are in the kitchen because of the set up. Their bread and pastry items are good but there isn't much selection."}
{"text":"Don't get the Roast Beef sandwich, I guess I'm used to hot roast beef because their's was cold and not to my or my friends liking.  The Clam Chowder was good, but I can't say much more then that."}
{"text":"Pizza was tasty, salty, and hit the spot, but what was that coming out of the soda fountain instead of pink lemonade? My wife thought my iced tea needed to be converted into an Arnold Palmer, for her few sips she wanted to steal from me. So I thought I'd add the pink lemonade to make it special for her, but instead of lemonade it was some form of brown soda water! Not cool!"}
{"text":"When looking for good French bread in Las Vegas, a trip to Paris casino is necessary. I really enjoyed it. I had the ham & cheese baguette with potato salad. Later after a visit to the top of the Eiffel tower, I came back for some ice cream.  They bake their own bread here, would have grabbed a loaf since they really looked good, but the rest of our meals in Vegas were planned out and no room for munching! Next time."}
{"text":"I like the location inside the Paris Casino because the elegant French interior design is a welcome break from the decor of many of the \"over the top\" casinos. The staff is friendly and efficient. The cheese danish is amazing!"}
{"text":"The pastries are very good here. The raspberry turnover is my absolute favorite. The coffee is strong but very good, not at all resembling the burnt flavor of the typical French roast."}
{"text":"Had the vegetable sandwich and thought it was worth every penny of the $9...Vegas pricing, whatta we gonna do about it? I thought it was so good, I went back again the next day for lunch! The bread was so fresh and it was just the perfect mixture of hummus-baby greens-cucumbers-onions-tomatoes"}
{"text":"While the BLT I got here was really good, I would not make a point to come back to this restaurant when in Vegas. This was good for a quick meal but since there are so many options in Vegas I would likely hold out for something else."}
{"text":"I was able to get a quiche at 1 AM so I appreciate that. My friend said the pizza was delicious. They get a fail on presentation of the quiche but again, 1 AM."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza on the strip.. take that back one of the best pizza joints in all of Vegas!   I usually go for the Margherita or the Wild Mushrooms, both vegetarian! Slices are huge, ingredients are fresh & the dough is just right not too thin not too thick. When you buy 2-slices you get a free drink!  Did I mention its not overpriced like the rest of the strip? Truly getting your moneys worth!"}
{"text":"Whenever I stay at Bally's or Paris, I always find myself walking by this place. When you're hungry..this place isn't too bad. A bit pricey obviously but the pizza here is pretty delicious. I've never had any problems here. Lines not too long... just there isn't enough seating as there is already. Overall, my kids love it and if its just something quick without having to leave the strip..with kids..this is not too bad. 1 slice is already huge so 1 for 2 young kids 3 & 5 is more then enough for them. The pizza is actually pretty fresh. Better then ordering any chain pizza places near home. I especially like the dough they use for the crust. No doubt this is one of my stops when my kids are craving pizza and and the prices are not bad as I said. I think you can get 2 slices with a drink for around $10? I don't actually remember how much it costs but I just know it wasn't super overpriced like some of the steak houses here   Yelp Review 2018 Challenge 24/100"}
{"text":"Ordered a large pie half pepperoni half margarita on a busy wednesday night - took 20 mins to make ($28). This place is inside the Paris hotel & casino and is very convenient to just order and go. The pizza was delicious with a bit of parmesian cheese and red pepper flakes sprinkled on. The next day the now cols pizza tasted even better - but i guess thats only if you enjoy cold pizza.."}
{"text":"A group of us stopped here late at night for pizza after clubbing. The pizza was very good, much better than I anticipated at that hour."}
{"text":"Yep, I ate here a few times for breakfast since I liked the location. They are not the cheapest place on the strip, but they're really close to Bally's in the tunnel on the way to the Paris. The food is made with fresh ingredients making for simply great food.   You stand in line, order, pay, and wait for your food. There are tables inside and through a set of doors, there are a lot more tables. It's not a huge place but it works.   We tried the steel cut oatmeal which was served with a fruit compote, nuts, and a honey syrup on the side (which you have to ask for or they'll put the whole thing in). It was very tasty and nice to eat something a little healthier than usual.    We also got a bagel with garlic spread which was nice, but it was not super filling. I was happy I was sharing the oatmeal too.  We also got an egg croissant with ham. That was wonderful. The croissant was flaky, and toasted. The egg was perfect light and fluffy, as well as a very tasty piece of ham to tie the whole thing together. Yes I had a bite of that too.   They also have sandwiches at lunch that are amazing. I had the Italian and it was about as harmonious as a sandwich can be with the dressing, meats and flavors all working together.   For some tasty food that is easy to get to, I recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place gets a lot of foot traffic because of its location being right across from Le Village. Heavy foot traffic means lackluster ambiance. You feel like you are eating in a mess hall.   Yet, I'm not sure why this place gets no love. Did y'all lose your minds along with your money, because I will help you find it in the form of my review.  Big portions.  I was full after eating half a sandwich here.  I'm not a soup or chowder girl, and I thoroughly enjoyed the clam chowder.   Rustic bread so good it will cut ya - literally. So big, crusty, and chewy that you cut the sides of your mouth because you have to open wide to take a bite. Brilliant.  Side of fries = a huge heaping plate of skinny fries enough to feed 6 hungry girls.  Pastries are boss.  Look at the caramelized choux (peep the pix), and tell me that's not boss.  Drinks - self serve fountain soda and coffee station.  Location: across from Le Village in Paris/near Harrah's."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the weirdest reviews I'm going to write ever.   After ordering our food (I'll get that), I sat down across the small table from my dad and a roach scurried across it. A ROACH!!!  That should automatically make me want to give them 1 star and it almost did until I ate the crossant. I hate them but the Crossant was delicious. They get 1 star for the crossant.   Other than that, it was typical food, like what you'd receive in an airport. The egg basically came from McDonald's. It was bland no flavor. The bacon was decent and crispy. The portions were huge. The Cheese Danish was good (as per my dad). The coffee apparently was terrible.   There was also horrible construction noise as they were renovating something next door.   In the end it was $20 for 2 breakfast sandwiches and 2 ocean spray juices.   Seriously weirdest review ever. Gross roaches... ughhhhh  (For other Roach stories, check out my Paris Hotel review. Apparently there were more throughout my trip)."}
{"text":"Sorry, have yet to try this establishment. Will have 2 stars until I give this bakery a change."}
{"text":"Walking through the Paris hotel & casino, The Better Half all of a sudden had a craving for dessert.  I think the large displays of pastries and sweet smell in the air from this joint had something to do with it.   Whatever it was, it worked on her.....we \"had\" to stop and wait in a long line so she could satisfy her craving...LOL.  After a short wait, we went through the line and she had a large slice of Chocolate Cake.  We sat in the common eating area and people watched while she enjoyed her Cake.  This is located by a very busy walkway, so the people watching is great.  There's nothing like watching people late at night in Vegas....it's a show all by itself, ha!  The desserts here are awesome....next time, I want to try a slice of Pizza.  Return Factor - 80%"}
{"text":"HUGE GINORMOUS sandwiches!!!  My friends and I popped in here for a quick and easy dinner before a long night ahead. First off, the desserts and pastries in the display looked so beautiful and delicious, but I had to pass them up. I ordered the italian deli sandwich, and I had no idea that the sandwich was going to be this huge, fatty footlong meal!! It was really tasty though, tons of insides. It was so filling that I was only able to eat half of it actually. My friends munched down their 2nd halves post-clubbing later that night and they said it was still tasty!"}
{"text":"No good. We had 6 of us all order different things.  Only the pizza man was happy. One turkey wrap looked like it had been already chewed. My veggie wrap was bad, I just put a bunch of mayo on it. Their idea of \"salad\" was a tiny cup of potato salad. Not a happy meal."}
{"text":"After yesterday's breakfast at Jean Philippe inside Aria City Center, we decided to come to Paris's JJ Boulangerie for a change.   We got in around 9am and already there was a long line ahead of us. We had to find a table for party of 6. We ordered 3 cranberry roll, walnut roll, croissant, original french bread and another long sweet rolls, 3 OJ and a coffee. The lady in the bakery side was very nice helpful, suggesting the french bread when I asked for any breads that didn't have any dairy and egg ingredients in them since my daughter is allergic to these. She also gave us some marmalade to spread on the french bread.  Everything was delicious and the price was great! The rolls were 3 for 99 cents!!! The whole bill was less than $20!   It's not fancy like JP, but good enough for me!"}
{"text":"We stopped off here for an afternoon snack and took advantage of the 2-slices and a drink for $9.99 deal.  The pizza slices were very big, with each of us slicing our individual slices into 2 smaller pieces so we could eat it easier. The pizza was fresh and tasty! No complaints here."}
{"text":"I grabbed a slice of pizza later in the evening while staying at the Paris.  They have a $10 deal for 2 slices and a Coke.  There are a variety of basic toppings and some specialty pizzas.  Pizza slices weren't too large, but they tasted OK.  There is a large selection of made to order sandwiches and salads.   Food comes out pretty quick and there is a good deal of seating available.  If you are looking for basic food while you are drunk you will like this place."}
{"text":"You're staying at the Paris.    It's Saturday morning, 8am.  You're famished.  You get in line at JJs for \"quick\" bite.  Then wait.  And wait.  Then, just as you feel your stomach writhe in agony, you finally make it to the counter!    You order what any self-respecting bacon lover would: the bacon, egg, and cheese croissant.  Now nourishment is in your grasp!  Six thick strips of sweet, salty, clog-your-arteries goodness!  Oh, and the croissant is actually pretty good, too.  To wash it all down is a steaming cup of the worst excuse for coffee you could spend $3 on.  Or you could get a cup of plain hot water for the kids for a reasonable $0.50."}
{"text":"tomato herb roll was DA BOMB!!!!  before leaving vegas, i bought 6 rolls to take home.  three for $1.50 or 79 cents each.    vanilla napoleon was very good,  my only gripe about this place would be the line.  the first day we ate there, there was a very long line that got stuck at the pizza area.  we wanted pizza; so we were waiting patiently behind those folks.  people who wanted other stuff passed us up in line to get to the cashier.  and then when we got up to the pizza counter, they told us to go ahead and order with the cashier and then they would make the pizza. (we wanted one that wasn't already available.)   so then we were stuck behind all those people who passed us up.  grr.  pizza is pizza.  it was good, but im not raving about it.  something about that tomato roll was just heavenly though"}
{"text":"With so many sit-down restaurant options at Paris, not to mention the buffet, JJ's fills a much-needed niche:  a spot for quick, carby, low-maintenance breakfast, which happens to be what I crave most mornings.  It came especially in handy on the Sunday morning of a blurry and exhausting Vegas weekend when I had to catch a plane in less than two hours.  Onion bagel with garlic herb cream cheese, a raisin danish, and Naked smoothie--bingo.  The bagel itself was mediocre, but everything else was good and I was very happy to get exactly what I wanted to start my day on a positive note.  They sell a bevy of pastries and other bready breakfast bites, plus a few hot items such as egg & ham croissants and steel-cut oatmeal.  The prices are extremely fair given the setting.  Tip--if the tap water from the soda machine comes out at a trickle, just fill your cup with ice and use the hot water from the coffee machine.  You're welcome."}
{"text":"If you love great pizza and are willing to wait a bit, go to JJ's. It is located at the Paris hotel on the Strip. They have some of the best wild mushroom pizza you will ever have. The crust is thin and perfect and all made right there in front of you.  JJ's gets very crowded and they do have seating, but it can be a wait. If you are staying at the hotel, maybe just get it to go and take back to your room.  Don't bother trying to have bagels or breakfast items there, it is crowded, they aren't very good and the service is somewhat slow. The pizza, however, is worth the time and trouble. Have a great time."}
{"text":"I have to keep going back to this place because my 8 year old loves the pizza, my husband loves the coffee and my daughter loves the gelato but I truly dislike the people who work at this place. This is by far the worst Service you will ever get anywhere and its not even a Vegas strip thing these people are just rude. One side of the cafe doesn't even like the people working on the other side. When I was there there was an argument about which side was responsible for heating up my brownie! I went back and forth till someone reluctantly did it (the brownie was so good) Look the pizzas good and affordable, the coffee is great and the raspberry gelato is delicious but these people need to be retrained in the art of being human."}
{"text":"I cannot imagine how anyone gives this place a good rating. I went to get a bagel. They told me X/Y/Z bagels were out and I only had a certain choice. I pay, get into the next line. All the people in front of me that ordered the same thing, didn't get the correct bagels b/c the cashiers all told the wrong thing. Then they skipped me and I just stood there for 5 mins while everyone after me got food. Then they gave me the wrong bagel (of the remaining ones \"available\")."}
{"text":"Pizza was good but the service was awful, look if you don't want to work then just go home, they pay you to serve the customers, not to stand there and sigh because we want to order food. Pissed me off. No thanks, I'll spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love their coffee!! Any form of mocha, cappucino, etc. Gimme gimme! Happy happy girl here. They have lovely sandwiches and you know I never got to anything else but do try the high test!"}
{"text":"I ordered the BLT, which was delicious. Service is average. The wait time for food was a little too long...but it was worth it! Desserts are really good here. I will eat here again."}
{"text":"I ordered a 'seared salmon sandwich on a roll' for $9. I was expecting a small sandwich ($9 in vegas.. I didn't expect a feast!). The sandwich came out and it was massive! I couldn't eat it all and wish I had someone to split it with. It was made right in front of me too so I know it was fresh (I didn't want to eat old salmon!).  My only complaint is that the prices are iffy.. A bottled drink is $4 (really??) but it's just $2 is you want chips and a fountain drink. You have to pay attention or they end up taking all your money!  I wish I'd eaten less so I could've tried some of the amazing-looking desserts in display case!"}
{"text":"Avoid this place at all costs. You'd get better tea/coffee, pastries, cream cheese, and service at any Starbucks. I can't believe they actually charge money for what they have! The bread is a disaster. It's cold and hard to chew. They have open container cream cheese and generic smackers jam.   I would not go back every again."}
{"text":"Located in the Paris hotel, this is one of the more casual places to dine. The place has a wide selection of drinks, chips, pizza, sandwiches, gelato and tasty sweets.  I had a couple slices of the margherita pizza that had been sitting under the heat lamp for too long and weren't very good, but ended with a totally delicious and decadent multi-layered cake covered in dark chocolate with a lime green candy ribbon on the top.  I would have given the place one star but the dessert bumped it up to 3 stars. The lady sitting next to me had gelato and said it was really good. I can't wait to sample their other desserts next time I visit the place."}
{"text":"Average run of the mill, greasy (a sign of imitation cheese), pizza place. Good for a quick bite, however."}
{"text":"I'm not so sure why people like this place so much. Maybe because it is \"French\", so therefore the average American tourist thinks its fancy? I came here to get a quick breakfast before departing LV and while the prices were fair (for Vegas), the food was fairly unremarkable.   Go here if you want a crappy bagel and cream cheese for $3."}
{"text":"Good inexpensive food. The sandwiches are generous in size. I would suggest splitting it with someone then save some room for dessert."}
{"text":"Located within Paris Hotel, JJ's Boulangerie has the atmosphere of a real French bakery. We had the egg and ham croissant and a chocolate croissant. Both were light and flaky and fresh when I sunk my teeth into them. Delightful. They also serve a variety of fresh breads and sandwiches and there are not as many people waiting in line as there are at the buffets!"}
{"text":"The eclair and strawberry tart were definitely previously frozen and rock hard.  The crossiant was old and stale.  The hot chocolate was watered down and tasted worse than Swiss Miss.  This place was better a few years ago.  I had expected more after paying $20 for the above.  In addition, the cashier was very impolite and seemed to rush through every customer."}
{"text":"If I could give this place NEGATIVE stars I sure would.  The wait to order food was exceedingly long.  Then, the first three things we ordered....well they were out of those.  Then to top it all off, the lady taking the money was a rude b....  Don't waste your time your money or your sanity!!!!!"}
{"text":"A nice place to grab a quick bite in between meals, but also has a wonderful breakfast selection. I very much enjoyed the breakfast croissant sandwich options, and the incredibly fancy fruit tarts! Yum, and just gorgeous artistry.   I would definitely recommend this place for anyone staying at the Paris! A great spot, great great service as well. The ladies at the Pizza Slice window are hilarious! ha! Always a pleasure to be served with a smile."}
{"text":"I was really hoping to have a better breakfast than I did. We were looking for a quick breakfast before heading to the airport. I paid $11 for a sausage egg and cheese breakfast sandwich. This would have been ok if the croissant wasn't so soggy. My friend paid $5 a piece for a Perrier, bottled ice tea,  and small fruit bowl. The chocolate chip cookie was good, but not great. Definitely didn't like the coffee. Fair service, but I'd pass and look for something else for breakfast."}
{"text":"In the heart of the Las Vegas Strip dessert J.J's Boulangerie pumps out out of this world tasting dessert. It is really out of this world and in Paris off the Rue de La Paix Shopping Walkway. It is a place where the aroma of baking bread, pizza, and dessert could lead you off the main cobblestone walking path of Paris into a working bakery and restaurant that is modeled after one in Paris, France.           Before I continue with the review, here is a trivia question. What does boulangerie mean? The answer is that is the French word for bakery where bread is sold.        I have stopped at J.J 's Boulangerie for nearly a decade-and-a-half. The majority of the visits were for a light breakfast. I appreciate the remarkable attention to detail in the Paris theme that gives me a unique experience in the desert. Over the years; I have enjoyed looking at the brick interior, vaulted ceiling, display cases of culinary heaven, chefs creating pizza pies, tourists from around the globe united in a Parisan restaurant near the Eiffel Tower, people watching along the high traffic Rue de la Paix. Most of all I enjoy the taste aspect of the boulangerie.        This is a self service eateries that is open from 7 AM to the very early morning hours. The food offerings are impressive. They include croissants, pizza, sandwiches, baguettes, salads, scones, pastries, and gelato. The love of my life in this slice of Paris has been their raspberry napoleon. Up to this writing, the J. J's raspberry napoleon is the best dessert that I have had in Las Vegas. I will repeat it again:   Up to this writing, the J.J's raspberry napoleon is the best dessert that I have had in Las Vegas!!! :-)      When I bite into the raspberry napoleon, the taste elevates my taste buds to a state of deliciousness higher than the Eiffel Tower. It is so delicious that I feel like I leave this world and end up in another world like Paris. This dessert that I write so highly about is a creamy puff pastry that is a Paris import. Isn't neat the way the unique hotels with fantastic themes bring great food into Las Vegas? The raspberry napoleon from Paris was originally called the mille-feuille in Paris. It is three layers of puff pastry known as pate feuilletee filled with two sections of flavored pastry cream and topped off with powdered sugar and raspberry touch.      The coffee is also superb. I consider it the mystery blend coffee because it is unadvertised. It is a delectable mystery blend coffee that you serve yourself and refill. It is the perfect coffee to go along with delicious food.     Over the years, I have ordered other food here. This includes a strawberry shortcake pastry that I rate highly, a vanilla napoleon, and other food.     J.J's Boulangerie is a very popular spot in Paris, Las Vegas. It gets way too busy where a line can extend to the Rue de La Paix. Regrettably finding a table is similar to winning a game of chance at the casino. On a good day you can grab a table along the Rue de La Paix. However, on a bad day every table in the two Parisan themed rooms fill up delaying the pastry for another time. I feel that the drop the rating from 5 to 4 star flaw is that their is a want for taking out and insufficient seating. There is a want for a take out bag where customers can carry the food to a nearby bench or any nearby seating place.     After nearly a decade-and-a-half my heart still beats strong for the raspberry napoleon. As they say in Paris \"je reviendrae\" : I will return.   ------------------------------------------ These pictures include the best dessert that I have had in Las Vegas up to the time of this review : The raspberry napoleon."}
{"text":"This was the best sandwich I've ever had.  I wanted something simple so instead of ordering from the menu I ordered a turkey sandwich with lettuce- that's it. Yes they did ring it up wrong & had to make it over but the bread and huge amount of turkey more then made up for the mistake. I'm pretty picky about sandwiches & subs & I absolutely loved this.  Girl at the counter taking orders was rude & again messed up my order but the girl making my sandwich was very nice & apologetic about it being wrong, & quickly made me a new one.  I will come back here every time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Run from the pizza at JJ Boulangerie inside the Paris hotel in Las Vegas, NV!  With a price of $25.93 for a regular Margarita pizza, one would think they are proud of their product; however, don't let the price fool you, and don't get me wrong, this review is not about the price.  It is about the taste and quality of their pizza.  This pizza was so hard, it literally crunched as it was bitten.  You know the term \"cardboard pizza\"?  You would be better off with frozen Totino's from the local grocery store.  Skip this pizza joint and do yourself a favor.  If you are craving pizza, walk on down to the connected Bally's hotel and grab some Sbarro's pizza.  Sbarro is located adjacent to the Bally's Las Vegas Race and Sports Book.  Enjoy your pizza."}
{"text":"This place was once one of my favorite spots on the Las Vegas BLVD. I loved coming here to get their bread and other baked goods. Not sure if ownership changed but this place is horrible now. Stale old hard bread now and the service is horrific... The sandwich lady yells people's names almost to the point where you can't understand her and the sandwiches are the worst I have had in Las Vegas since moving here over 13 years ago."}
{"text":"While we were waiting for our crepes I had a sudden craving for french onion soup. My bf noticed the boulangerie and went inside to see if they had some. He came back with a cup of soup. I opened the lid and did not see any gruyere (the melted cheese floats on top of the soup). I was like wtf! Bf went back inside to ask if the soup normally comes with the cheese and they said no. I was like damn! The cheese is like the best part of this soup! The base was alright...but come on...I need the cheese to make it complete!"}
{"text":"After ordering a sandwich they tell us there is a 30 minute wait for a sandwich. So we had to request to change it to a slice of pizza. The pizza blah and very greasy. I would not eat here again."}
{"text":"This is a great place to have a quick, tasty dinner when you're hungry and tired from walking the strip and just want something quick and yummy in a nice, relaxed atmosphere.  We kept coming back for the BLTs (and we weren't even staying in Paris!). They were really good, and depending which person was making them, they would be done slightly differently. Their caesar salads are also tasty... very good dressing.   We tend to come back here every time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"I had a lot of things to buy so the cashier let me borrow her pen and gave me a slip of paper to write everything down.  I bought like 16 items. LOL.  The pastries here are top notch.  I love the florentines.  And the prices are a little lower than standard for the strip.  Don't bother the person working behind the bread area.  She's just there to make sandwiches, not sell bread.  I made that mistake twice already.  Ha ha."}
{"text":"We stopped here for a quick bite to eat for lunch. We ordered a Caesar salad that came with no meat and cheap packaged dressing, a sandwich, piece of pizza, a small cannoli and a bottled soda and orange juice. This came to a whopping $45!! That is outrageous. The food was good, but definitely not $45 good. Save your money and enjoy a sit down/table service restaurant."}
{"text":"Wanted to get a quick bite to eat before hitting the pool. Ordered our food and ended up waiting 30-45 minutes for 2 sammiches. I did notice the ladies making the sammiches were taking their time and a lot of people behind me got their order first.  They didn't ask if I wanted the order to-go and handed it to me on plates. I asked them  to change it to to go and they spent another 5 minutes looking for containers.  The sammiches were alright..the bread was a bit stale on my pretzel roll. The portion sizes were great and they come with a salad."}
{"text":"The seating situation was terrible.  There were so many people there and I would have gladly taken the food to my room if I was actually staying there.  I was staying at a much lower budget hotel and it was 2 blocks away but getting through all those people...ick.  Now for the good part:  I went there 2x in 2 consecutive days.  The first day I bought 2 slices of pizza with a drink for about $10 and immediately regretted it.  My friend picked up an awesome looking sandwich of provolone cheese and prosciutto with the tiny french pickles.  I went back the second day and bought that while my friends went to buffets.  It was so worth the trip by myself.  I got that and had my own water.  The sandwich was roughly $9 and if you want it with chips and drink it's only $12.  In Vegas, what a deal."}
{"text":"The wait was long but the breakfast croissant was worth the wait....buttery, big and packed with thick bacon and egg."}
{"text":"i always have to get a sandwich whenever im in las vegas! i havent tried any of the pizzas or desserts, but they do look good! The sandwiches are very tasty, i have not been disappointed yet! the only reason i rate it a 4 is the price. It is a little pricey, but it is worth it!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give zero stars for the service! They had the most inefficient service I've ever experienced.   We ordered a caffe mocha and a vanilla latte. Simple, right? The person taking our order had the hardest time understanding what we wanted. In the end, she repeated our order as \"one caffe mocha, and one vanilla latte with vanilla\" which was a bad sign.   She had to ask two different people how to work the espresso machine. In the meantime, the line was backing up and no one came to help at the register. After making our drinks she brought them over without knowing which drink was which. She had to look at the receipt to repeat the names of the drinks back to us.. but she still couldn't tell us which drink was which.   The drinks were pretty bad for the amount of time we had to wait for them. We ended up asking for a refund which took a while to get since they had to wait at least 10 mins for a manager to come by. The manager apologized but didn't seem to care. He also was super inefficient in calculating our refund total. We also ordered a lemon merengue tart (which was the only good thing about this place) and instead of ringing up the drinks to get the total, he rung up the tart then used his cell phone to subtract that from the total.   Le sigh... Such a waste of time."}
{"text":"Decent joint to grab a quick sandwich, but like most everything in Vegas, what you pay is greater than what you get.  My buddy and I arrived into town very early on a Thursday morning.  After checking in, we decided to grab some breakfast.  We got into the line for JJ's and it was about a dozen deep.  This isn't so bad, but I only counted 4 employees working while I was there.  One was getting bread and desserts out of the case.  One was operating the register.  2 were working on hot food behind the counter.  This was a recipe for a long wait, which we had.    When I finally made it up to the front of the line, I ordered a sausage, egg, and gouda sandwich on a croissant.  Price with tax was over $11.  I know it's Vegas, and I know it's the Strip, but this was pretty outrageous for what I got.  I sat down and waited less than 10 minutes before my name was called.  The croissant was sort of sliced like a taco or pita with the stuff put inside.  The eggs were scrambled well, they weren't overdone and they were hot and fluffy.  The sausage was overcooked.  It wasn't burnt, but it was tougher than it should have been.  The casing was difficult to bite through.  And, there wasn't much of it.  I would say around 50% of the bites of sandwich had sausage in them.  Now, this may be a good thing given that the sausage was on the dry side and overcooked, but it was annoying to order a sausage, egg, and cheese sandwich and get sausage in every other bite.   The gouda was cold.  Not room temperature, not chilly, it was cold.  It was clearly just taken out of the fridge and placed on top of the sandwich right before sending it out to the floor.  No warming of any kind.  This threw off the entire sandwich, because instead of the hot eggs and sausage making the cold cheese melt, the cold cheese made everything sort of room temperature.  It was a disappointment to be sure.   All of the above said, I would probably return if I stayed at Paris again (which is probably not going to happen, but never say never).  It's quick, and you can get food fairly easily.  Just expect to pay high Strip prices for less than average food."}
{"text":"First of all the pastries are wonderful! If only the same could be said for the sandwiches. The people making them obviously don't give a damn since they are probably never going to see the same customers again. Whatever happened to people having pride in the food they put out? They certainly don't at this place. 5 stars for the pastries, zero for the sandwiches, at least for what I was served."}
{"text":"Good stop in between Bally's and Paris for a quick breakfast or lunch.  Prices are reasonable, though service can be quite slow.  We had a sandwich and a cup of soup, and many, many cups of water.  Great break if you need to step outside of the casino air but not be outdoors."}
{"text":"One of the crappiest pizza I ever had in my life along with the worst service I ever had in Vegas... won't go 0 stars because system doesn't accept."}
{"text":"I was waking around And modded some quick food and this was the place.   They had a good deal going 2 pepperoni slices and a drink for $10.    The pizza was pretty solid.    No issues.     I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Stopped in about 1am had a slice of pepperoni pizza. Amazing! Fam also had the BLT and Italian sandwiches which were so fresh and delicious. Wow! Great food. Great spot."}
{"text":"Good for the grab and go items i.e. a croissant. Otherwise be very clear on what you order. Somehow a sausage got inserted in my croissant egg and cheese sandwich when i never requested it. The cook wouldn't fix it until I had the cashier come speak to her. Also don't get the eggs, definitely fake eggs."}
{"text":"The Italian sandwich is two thumbs down. The bread was hard as a rock. Eat somewhere else or order something else."}
{"text":"I remember ordering a baguette here years ago and loved it.  On my recent trip to Vegas we decided to stop in and get breakfast.  We ordered two Ham and Gruyere sandwiches and one Sausage and Egg Croissant Sandwich.  The line wasn't too bad and moved fairly quickly.  Little did I know that the food will not be made near the register.  Once you pay you are told to go and wait for your name to be called.    I headed over near the bread area and waited.  After about 15 minutes the Sausage and Egg Croissant was ready.  I was then told 2 more minutes for the Ham and Gruyere sandwiches.  The sausage and egg sandwich was huge and my sister loved it.  About 10 minutes later my son's and my sandwiches were ready.  I opened it up to find the bread warm but once I bit into it the sandwich (which I saw go through the toaster twice) was still cold.  How can sandwiches be cold after 25 minutes?  My son wouldn't eat his and after about half of mine I just ate the bread.  The sandwiches were also supposed to come with dressing, tomato and lettuce all of which they did not put on the sandwiches which was fine for my son but my sandwich was seriously lacking flavor.  What as disappointment especially considering the cost of this sandwich.  I can scratch this place off my list when I return."}
{"text":"Mmmm the best prime rib and roast beef sandwich ever!! The sandwich was pipping hot, meat tender, cheesy, and the horseradish mayo all complimented the sandwich deliciously! The au jus was so flavorful as well! This restaurant is nothing fancy, but I would definitely return for this sandwich!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Not bad for a casual, order at the counter, grab your food to eat at tables kind of place. The prices are slightly less than what's around it and honestly the 3 rolls for $1.50 (tomato ones) were really good.  I had a salad which I thought was decent and my wife got soup. Unfortunately she found 2 hairs in her croutons and complained. When she did, they offered her anything on the menu, but since she was grossed out, she got a chocolate croissant which was good.   I think it's better to order something that's already made here since it takes a little time for the workers to make your sandwich, salad, etc. If I was starving and didn't want to wait for waiter service, I'd stop by again."}
{"text":"Stay away from the egg breakfast sandwiches. The croissant is good. The eggs were WAY undercooked and slimy. For $10, even in Vegas, I expected it to at least be edible.  Coffee is meh. Would have liked some flavored creamers, at least.  The only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is because their pastries are very good."}
{"text":"Service was terrible, pizza was delicious delicious(we had pepperoni, mushroom, margarita, and meat). If you don't mind waiting an hour while being told just to go to Sabbaro by the employee-this is your place. My husband went at 10:40 in the morning to get pizza. He was told they don't serve pizza until 11, so cone back back 15 minutes. At 11 he was told to return in 29 minutes again because the ovens weren't to temp so there weren't any pizzas ready. They should be more prepared for the weekend rush."}
{"text":"If you like weak overpriced coffee this is your place! If you like actual coffee, go to the kiosk near the casino."}
{"text":"I am only rating the cashier's service and the crème brûlée. It was awesome to have found the crème brûlée here sends café Madeleine, next door, had ran out hours before. In fact, they run out around 4 PM on that particular day and the day before. So, now you know that there is another place to get the same awesome crème brûlée."}
{"text":"A lovely little find on the expensive and overdone strip. The pizza looked great and they had a two giant slices plus drink for $10 deal. But I was going healthy so I had a \"6 inch\" prosciutto and provolone sandwich on crusty, hearty French bread. It was closer to 10\" though I didn't have a ruler. Excellent. The chef made it fresh and baked it. Lots of fresh veggy toppings. $9 and a whole meal. I also had a serving of French onion soup. Very good and modestly priced at $4.50. This is dirt cheap on the strip. Plus they actually had water on tap, which you almost can't find here since everyone wants you to buy bottles. The cafe is buried in the passage of shops between Paris abd Bally hotels, so look sharp."}
{"text":"The pastry here was sooo yummy!! I remember we stopped before we headed out for the day and we picked up a few pastries and drinks. It was soooooo good i told myself to come back and pick up some more before we head for home.  Too bad but its ok it just means I gotta go back to Vegas ASAP =D"}
{"text":"This was my frist time eating here with my family and it was terrible from the customer service to the food. It was awful!!  15 minutes went by and I went to go check on my sandwich, they didn't start on it yet!! Really!!"}
{"text":"We ended up at JJ's after first discovering that Bally's Big Kitchen Buffet was no longer open, and then seeing that the line at Le Village Buffet would delay our day trip plans to the Dam.  My breakfast consisted of a ham, egg and cheese croissant with a cup of coffee and a fresh squeezed orange juice. I was in breakfast heaven, although considering the size of the croissant sandwich, I should have shared. The croissant was made with real butter, and the eggs were perfectly cooked. The ham was quite yummy too, and everyone in our party remarked how pleasantly surprised we were that the coffee was good too!  One tip, if you plan on getting the waffles ask for them well done. My hubby got those and they were a little undercooked."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are not that great and over priced but it's a good place for some coffee and French pastries, the cheese cake, the vanilla Neapolitan and vanilla custard is . That's the only thing you should get, everything else is over priced."}
{"text":"Pizza is amazing  Crepe melted the plastic plate and they didnt have any lemon  Highly recommended for their pizza   I saw a cockroach in the dining room hanging out on the wooden trash container"}
{"text":"JJ's Boulangerie is located inside the Paris Hotel.  It is a good stop for a quick breakfast or snack.  We stopped in on a Friday morning and got a couple sandwiches. The line wasn't too long but it seemed to move incredibly slow.  You place your order at one counter then the order is completed at another.    Once the order was placed, it probably took a good 20 minutes to get the three sandwiches.  They had only one person making all of the orders which seemed really mismanaged.  I felt terrible for the guy who was trying his hardest to keep up.  We ordered two ham and cheese and one sausage, egg and cheese. The ham and cheese looked decent and had a good amount of ham.  The sausage sandwich was better than expected.  It had a really good, European style sausage and the egg was incredibly soft and airy.  It was actually pretty tasty.  The prices are about on par with Vegas, overpriced but you know that going to Vegas, everything will be.  I would return again and I would probably get the same breakfast sandwich."}
{"text":"Loved this little cafe! Was staying at the adjoining Bally's and stopped by here everyday. Fantastic pizza and pastries. And the crêpes are delicious. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were looking for somewhere cheap and fast to eat before we started our day. All I can remember about this place was their Salmon sandwich! It was so good! The sandwich was very tasty and it was a nice way to start off my day!"}
{"text":"Yelp's 365 Review Challenge 2015 #10 - #365  If you're looking to have a taste of tacky Vegas themed restaurant then JJ's is your best bet to have some Parisian eats.  Around breakfast time, the lines can be long but moves quickly. It's right across from the Le Village Buffet and offers fake outdoor patio seating. My favorite food to order besides the fruity danish and fruity desserts is the smoked salmon baguette. Having had the smoked salmon baguette just wants to wisp you away to Paris France.   I wish other resorts like Treasure Island, Mirage, Luxor and Excalibur can follow what Paris still holds to its theme. I'm talking about restaurants that fit in with the hotel theme. But anyways, JJ's will always be my go to Parisian eatery at the Paris Hotel.   I would like to also add that I am a huge fan of their fruit tarts, French eclairs and decadent chocolates."}
{"text":"Wednesday I came here for breakfast. I wanted a small breakfast. All I had was a breakfast croissant, Greek yogurt, and coffee. The breakfast croissant consisted of sausage, egg, and smoked gouda cheese. The breakfast croissant was delicious and filling. The charred sausage, smoked gouda, and toasted croissant  brought a buttery aroma and taste to the breakfast croissant. The Greek yogurt was a cherry Fage Yogurt. The coffee was a nice start to begin the day. Overall a nice small breakfast. The price for breakfast was tad pricy, but you're in Vegas what do you expect. At least I added points to my Total Rewards Card."}
{"text":"This is my favorite quick place to eat in Vegas. The ham and cheese croissant and the éclairs are my favorite things to get from here. The croissant is flaky buttery perfection. If your staying at the Paris or nearby its a must try."}
{"text":"If this is your first time in Vegas, welcome to sticker shock. EVERYTHING seems to be more expensive unless you're in a dive casino, then it's super cheap. Sorry while I digress, so I ordered the ham, gruyere cheese croissant breakfast sandwich.  $10.95 plus tax. Yes, you read correctly. It's not cheap but it's uber tasty and filling.  The croissant was light and flaky. Stuffed in it was the fluffiest scrambled eggs I've had in a long time. It was covered with slices of smoky ham and tucked around both were slices of gruyere cheese. They wrap it in wax paper for you to go and it's the perfect breakfast sandwich.  Simple yet delectable in taste. I would definitely go back again when I visit Vegas.   As for their coffee/lattes, I can't say b/c they don't carry soy milk so I had to pass on it. Maybe by the next time I visit,  they will start offering soy milk."}
{"text":"After landing and checking into our hotels, my buddies and I found ourselves standing in the Paris casino, debating on where to go to fill our stomachs.  Though we were starving after kicking off our day with a couple of rounds of drinks, we couldn't just eat anywhere mind you.  With our snooty, foodie status and exquisitely high standards, we needed to find a place that would fulfill not just one, but TWO important criteria:  1) whatever was quick so we could get another round and gamble, and 2) whatever was closest.  Since we were about 20 ft away from JJ's while pondering what to do, well...they won.  Now, after seeing other reviews, JJ's apparently sells a bunch of pastries and bagels for something light and quick.  To be honest, I have absolutely no idea if that's true.  Maybe they're only around in the morning, or maybe they were there and I just didn't see them, but I was too focused on getting my hands on their hot Italian Deli sandwich.  Loaded with salami, ham, provolone, lettuce, and tomatoes, this is one hefty sandwich.  For about $9, you get a near footlong PACKED with all this meaty, tasty deliciousness.  Quite a good deal considering where you're at and what you're getting.  The toasty, crusty bread they use seals the deal, but it would still taste so good even if they didn't.  So much better than a $5 footlong from Subway.  Since one of my buddies ordered the cold prosciutto sandwich and then remembered that he doesn't like prosciutto, I felt bad and swapped halves with him.  Now, if you are a fan of prosciutto, this is the sandwich for you.  This thing was literally overflowing with meat from beginning to end (also had provolone, tomato, and lettuce in it).  I didn't think it was quite as good as the Italian Deli, but it held its own.  Not sure if my sodium tolerance could take eating a whole one though.  The bulk of their menu consisted of the sandwiches, as well as salads and pizzas, but I would probably skip the latter.  Although I didn't actually try it, it didn't look nearly as appetizing as some of the photos on here would make it.  Well, one in particular at least; the cheese and pepperoni just kind of blotted together into an oily-ish mess.  In any case, considering we went again the next day for that Italian Deli sandwich...I'd say it's a good bet we'll be back next time."}
{"text":"On a saturday evening they had 2 people working at the bakery/pastry/gelato counter and I remember my last weekend in Vegas was the same too. They should get another register on that side and at least one more person, especially on a saturday.   I bought a croissant and their Parisian Blend coffee. The croissant wasn't even as great as a grocery store croissant. I'd had a cheese danish last time and I remember it was amazing. To me it seemed more Euro-style (rich and heavy on the butter, great texture). The coffee was probably the worst I've ever had actually, sour and old. I threw it out and refilled from another of the dispensers and that one was actually palatable, although still shamefully weak and tasteless.   A place like this - although touristy and 'fake Paris-y' - should at least deliver on their staple stuff like coffee and croissants. I'd only return if I have to."}
{"text":"Reallyyy slow service, rude employees and very over priced. But what can you expect from Vegas casino. I wouldn't come back here again !!!"}
{"text":"Food court in Paris. Good for a quick breakfast or late night drunk food. The croque messier is big enough to share. Ask them to toast it extra hot though."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for 3yrs now only because it's the nearest place we can go to whenever we attend the Las Vegas Antique Jewelry & Watch show. This restaurant's service has ALWAYS SUCKED ever since I started going here.   The cashiers don't pay attention when they take your order. They get your name AND order wrong. The line is always long due to the unreasonable wait time. They are very unorganized.  They should do something about the way they accommodate their guests. They should find a better way to manage the long lines and serve customers better."}
{"text":"This place was terrible.  First off, it took forever to get our food.  And their serving system is awful.  We thought they called our name or order out after we ordered.  They don't.  You have to stand in line again after you stand in line to order- stand in line to wait to get your food.  Makes no sense.  Then the food finally came and the bread was crunchy and stale on my sandwich.  The meat was minimal and the sauce heavy.  If this is how real Paris sandwiches shops are, I will stick to the U.S.A."}
{"text":"I had a $75 credit to spend...so I came here...and spent it all!!  The fam and I had breakfast \"A La Francaise\".  Things we loved were the Napoleon, Pan au Chocolat, and the Strawberry Tart (super duper yum).  I took back with me some croissants, turnovers and raspberry cookies (the name escapes me).  I nicked a star because my hubby, a TRUE Italian, likes his espresso short.  It's a must for him...and they couldn't get it right.  It ruffled his feathers a bit, but the pastries were still great!  Not an inexpensive breakfast, may I add.  But you have to expect that when you're in a Vegas hotel."}
{"text":"This is the cheapest option if you are in Paris, which isn't saying much. We'll actually there's a place two doors down that had sandwiches in a display case but for an extra dollar or two we got a much more appetizing sandwich here.   I definitely would not go out of your way for this place. However, if it is 2pm, you just got in from your flight and don't want another airport refrigerated sandwich, then just maybe this is the place for you too."}
{"text":"For the last 10 years, I always go here to eat the best Napoleons, Flan and chocolate opera desserts and mousse bombs which I believe are also available from the Cafe Belle Madeleine. I prefer to eat here as the atmosphere is darker and more comfortable and usually less busy than the Cafe Belle Madeleine. Service is always only OK but the deserts are the best I have had anywhere on the strip."}
{"text":"I used to come here as a little kid and my mom and I would buy loads of croissants and french breads and eat it on the 12 hour drive back from vegas. Now that I'm allergic to gluten, I came here again to reminisce...  Meat pizza: Bf got this...during the afternoon, the pizzas looked skimpy and cold, but the ones we got (dinner hour) were fresh and looked amazing! He inhaled the slice and it definitely smelled heavenly!  Fruit parfait: Yes, I'm reviewing the fruit parfait. Why? Because other places (like Jean philippe) give you a super small cup for $7! I got a decently sized cup with quite a lot of delicious berries for $5-7! Come here if you are craving fruits or parfaits...much more worth it than other places!   I wanted to grab the cheese plates and other goodies too...Ah, JJ's, you still give me such joy, even after 10+ years! :) Prices are decent for the amount and the fact that it's Vegas. I'd definitely recommend this place if you are craving breads or \"on the go\" breakfast goodies!"}
{"text":"We were disappointed and still hungry after the buffet at Mandalay Bay so we had to get something. We weren't up for a full meal and while walking past this place decided to give it a go.  It's a walk up place; you know make your order and pay then walk to the area where they make your order.  We ordered a turkey sandwich and it was awesome, very delicious.  The service was mediocre and once you paid it wasn't a smooth process then again we were caught in the dreaded shift change when someone new was picking up for the one leaving. So the sandwich wasn't served too quickly. But we survived.  This place is worth checking out."}
{"text":"Now you, JJ's, you will definitely get a 5 star rating from us.   Had it for the first time walking through Paris with the bf on our last visit to Vegas. Looks like an average, nothing-out-of-the-ordinary cafe/bistro....and we most definitely did not expect it to become our FAVORITE sandwich place in Vegas.   Italian Deli - Ordered it the first time, ordered it again on our second visit. We will continue to get this every time. After having it the first time, we never stopped talking about this sandwich when we went back home. It's something in that that pesto mayo spread.... 5 stars  Prosciutto and Provolone - Lots of prosciutto and the pickles were such a nice, crunchy touch. Loved this sandwich. 5 stars  Now that sandwiches here are well worth my money. Great, big portions and very generous on the meats. The ladies here do them right."}
