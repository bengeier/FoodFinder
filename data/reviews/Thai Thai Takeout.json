{"text":"I'll get take-out from Thai Thai a couple of times a month.  The portions are generous and the prices are reasonable.  I usually get the Pad See Ew (broad noodles with broccoli and chicken) which is always delicious.  I've never found them to be especially fast in preparing the food but they're usually pretty accurate when they quote you a time.  So, if you're calling on a weekend and they say 30 minutes, don't get there too early or you'll wind up waiting."}
{"text":"Best thai food I've had in the entire country.  Seriously. The Peanut Sauce could be my favorite meal of any cuisine type!  Very friendly staff.  Huge portions, great prices - I couldn't say enough great things about this place."}
{"text":"Delicious! Ordered the Gaeng Dang with shrimp and highly recommend! Authentic Thai flavoring with generous portions. Our new go to Thai restaurant!"}
{"text":"Placed an order for two dishes- waited on hold for 5 min before someone answered phone. Should have known it was the start of bad experience. Was told 35 min to pick up. Went to pick up at 45 min- waited over 1 HR and then left without food ! No apology no explanation!"}
{"text":"Thai Thai was recommended to us by multiple friends and, after moving to the Dilworth area, we decided there was no better time to walk over and try it out. We frequent Basil and Thai Taste for casual Thai comfort food and thought that this would be a great, walkable addition to our repertoire.   The menu is large with options for customization on almost all dishes and the prices are considerably less than most other local Thai restaurants, which made sense to us since it is takeout-only. We decided to start with the Shrimp Rolls which were basically shrimp wrapped in egg roll wrappers and fried (as described on the menu). They were flavorful for a basic dish and the accompanying chili sauce was delicious. We followed the shrimp rolls with Pad Thai--a classic favorite of ours that both Basil and Thai Taste make very well. The portions lived up to the hype from our friends, big enough to make 2+ meals out of--which is a great deal for around $11. Despite the large portion sizes for a low price, the flavor and spice were lacking.   We ordered one chicken and one shrimp pad thai, both at a 3-level spice (on a scale of 1-5). The spice was lacking...it almost tasted as though no spice was added at all. The sauce was very runny and bland, there was little to no flavor in it and the chopped peanuts were thrown on top added zero to the dish whereas they typically add some additional flavor.   The staff at the restaurant was very friendly, but disorganized--they weren't sure of what went in our order when we arrived for pickup as a result of not asking for a name when we called it in. We plan to try Thai Thai again and choose some alternate dishes in the future to see if we can have any luck since this restaurant is so close but we certainly will not be running back, especially with other Thai options within a 5 mile radius."}
{"text":"I live right across the street from Thai Thai. After a year of driving/walking by and thinking \"I need to try that place\" I decided, this evening, to give it a shot. However, after calling 5 TIMES with no answer, I gave up. I don't understand how a place can stay in business if nobody answers the phone to take your order. After all, it is takeout ONLY.  I am very disappointed."}
{"text":"I just moved to Charlotte and was so excited to find this delicious gem just a couple blocks from my apartment. My mom and I ordered takeout and loved everything we got: tom ka soup with seafood, fresh rolls, and pad thai. Everything tasted fresh and was super flavorful. My mom still talks about how good that food is!"}
{"text":"The dishes I had were not cooked well, more like warm-serve. It should be well cooked given the waiting time of this place."}
{"text":"I found this little Takeout spot off of East Blvd inside Creative Loafing.I love the spiciness  and the flavors of Thai cuisine and Chef owner Tony Kwok's dishes are spot on."}
{"text":"This place is interesting. It's strictly a take out spot and they open from 5-10pm. Definitely not your average Thai food joint.   Overall the food is great and my personal favorite is the Mango Sticky Rice. They actually give you a bigger portion of sticky rice here than anywhere else I've been.   cleanliness is key here. Seeing as to how they don't actually have tables here so you can eat, I'd be surprised if it was dirty.   The lady is pretty friendly and straight to the point. It looked like if it was just her and another employee so probably family.   Overall its small, quaint, cheap and fantastic! definitely recommend this for them nights that you want to stay home and watch a movie!"}
{"text":"I ordered the pad Thai last night and am still recovering this morning. It had to be the worst pad Thai I have ever eaten. Maybe I was an unlucky one, but not worth the risk for me."}
{"text":"For those that complain about wait, you have to understand how this place works.  The lady that takes your order--cooks your food--hands you your food--takes the money.  So is it efficient?  No, but it has been like this forever and one of my go to places in Charlotte the last 10+ years.  You just have to know to call in advance and you may not even get an answer.  That should tell you it would be a long wait.  I just keep calling till an answer and ask how long of a wait to expect.  Food is delicious and reasonably priced.  The owner works incredibly hard.  Just know how this place runs and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The Best Thai Food I've had around here...fast, friendly. It will be spicy if you ask for it that way. I really like spicy food and 4 stars **** is perfect for me...I'll try 5 ***** eventually."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the portion sizes are huge!  Make sure you call and place your order in advance.  It may take a few rings to get them to pick up, but it is definately worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Thai Thai rocks!  Be prepared to wait for your food as this place gets slammed every night with takeout.    Very good portions.  Very good food.  Will definitely be at the top of this list for Thai food in Charlotte.  It's a somewhat limited menu but they do the dishes right...tasty.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"The food, the food, the food! After reading just a few of Thai Thai's other reviews, I realize I'm beating a dead horse but the wait for their glorious food is STUPID long. But it's sooo good! So, I recommend if your order's not ready when you get there, pop up to Brixx and have a drink!   My go to order is an order (or 2) of spring rolls and the chicken in garlic black bean sauce."}
{"text":"I used to excuse the poor service because the food was so good. But, no longer! We ordered takeout and was told it would be an hour. 2 hours later my boyfriend was sitting in their small waiting area and they had still not started our order. Enough is enough! I will be making Thai Orchid or Thai Taste my spot from now on."}
{"text":"I visited this takeout restaurant a year or so ago and found the food \"ok\". I've been in and out of Charlotte for the last 2-1/2 years and have yet to find a Thai restaurant that matches what I've found in other big cities. After being disappointed time and time again, I decided to give this place another try. UPDATE! This time I wasn't disappointed, there was a depth of flavor that was lacking before. I also asked for \"hot and spicy.\" It could have been hotter, but next time I will push the envelope and ask for the hottest level they make. In any case, I am happy with what they provide, and they have plenty of vegetarian options. One word of advice, it takes a long time to get your order, I would add 10 or 15 minutes to whatever they tell you or otherwise you will be waiting when you arrive."}
{"text":"THE BEST thai food I have had so far in Charlotte!   Our favorite is the red and green curry. It serves 2 people for sure and we sometimes have a bit left over.  I've recommended this place to so many people....just thought it's high time I post a review and let everyone know!!  Note: on busy days (weekends) the wait time could go up to 40 mins (although the standard response when placing the order on the phone is always 20 mins :))"}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place. The food is always incredible. There is nothing like their hot, spicy soups on a cold night. The owner is a complete sweetheart and the service is always excellent. You can't go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"Have been here twice now and love it! I've had the Seafood Clay Pot twice - delicious. Friendly service to boot."}
{"text":"Very good Thai food. I came from LA, which has a big Thai community and lots of great Thai restaurants. This place would not be the best compared to those but it definitely holds it's own. In Charlotte though, it's probably one of the best. I would've given 5 stars but there's one other place in Charlotte that's better, but it's a long, long ways away from this area. Definitely going to be my go-to Thai in the Dilworth / South End area."}
{"text":"My bf and I are both fans of Thai Thai.  Our food is always prepared super fast and it's still hot by the time we get it home.  My bf always gets the special Volcano Chicken.  Two huge pieces of breaded chicken cut into strips with white rice and steamed veggies....it comes with a huge container of what I guess is \"volcano\" sauce and this stuff is spicy!  If you like super spicy Thai, this one is for you.  Warning: after consuming the whole meal, Kevin usually gets \"the itis\" and remains worthless for the rest of the night.  I had Pad Thai with tofu and it was alright.  Not the best PT I have ever had but definitely the best I have found in Charlotte.  Tasty crispy spring rolls too and really good Thai iced tea."}
{"text":"Okay, let's first address the elephant in the room. Yes, this place isn't the fastest place to get food from. After calling ahead and giving them more than 30 min before picking it up, there was still 15 min required. So, just don't go here if you're in a rush to eat. Beyond that, not much that can be said negatively about it. And with that said, the food and the value make this a four star spot in my opinion.  I've only been here a few times but each time I have the food has been great, and plentiful! You can easily get three separate meals out of a takeout order from here and I tend to eat more than I probably should!  My latest meal from here was the Red Curry with chicken and it was great. I ordered it a spice level 5 and it was the perfect amount of hotness. Highly recommend if you're a fan of spicy food.  I've also had the Pud Thai from here as well and it doesn't disappoint. I'm very much looking forward to the next order I takeout from here. I'm guessing it will be another one of their delicious curry dishes."}
{"text":"We order from here whenever I am too lazy to cook haha The portions here are HUGE!!  I usually get the Thai fried rice and husband usually gets the red curry.  The food is not spectacular but its definitely decent for the price and portion.   If you are tired of Chinese and pizza take out, def give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time.  Awesome.  Blows any other Thai place around here away.  I just wish they were open for lunch.  There was actually spice and flavor in both dishes we got (Pad Thai and Pepper Garlic), which is something a lot of places just don't get.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The food is bland at best. Never been inside the actual restaurant. My fiance and I have order takeout twice, one time for Thai and the other for Indian. The food was so bland we had to use our own spices to make it palatable. The service was awful. When he went to pick up our orders he sat for 20 minutes and after being ignored for so long he called them from the counter and asked if he could have our order. We gave them two chances and weren't impressed."}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed Thai Thai yet? The last few times I went have left such a bad taste in my mouth (literally) that I can't let go of each bad experience I had. Just to start off with--I really wanted to like Thai Thai, truly, I did. I heard they had won awards like \"Best Takeout in CLT\" plus who doesn't love the idea of a take out only place?  So when I moved to Dilworth, I was stoked to have it nearby. I could call in my order, be there within 10 minutes and be on my merry way with a container full of noodles. That was the idea in my head at least. Like any Thai place I try, I judge them based off of their Pad Thai which is really difficult to mess up. The first time I went there, it was meh. There was absolutely no flavor to it, the veggies were funky and the tofu didn't seem like it was cooked enough. So maybe it was a bad batch, very possible. I gave it a second chance and ordered it with some extra spice that time around and it was not spicy whatsoever. Wtf? When I say I want spicy, I want my mouth to tingle a bit and maybe even sweat. I did try it the day after  and it was actually better than it was fresh and was enjoyable after adding a few tablespoons of the rooster.   So now, each time I drive or walk past Thai Thai, a little piece of my heart breaks. I really wanted it to be my good-to takeout spot but I just don't see it ever happening."}
{"text":"The food is on point from this place.  We got the standards - pad thai, lad na, pad see ew - everything was hot, fresh tasting and the spicy stuff was spicy.  But the wait is kind of absurd. Can't decide whether it is better or equal to Thai taste, but as far as food quality goes this place is in my top two for Thai."}
{"text":"Sadly, I haven't even tried there food!   My friend and I decided to try this place since it's practically next door. We waited in the place with no lines and only a couple sitting, waiting on their food.   We chatted with the couple and it must have been about 20 min before an asian lady came up to the counter. She suggested that we leave. She said she wasn't taking any orders and was at least 20 min behind."}
{"text":"I don't know what all the hub bub is about this place. I took 2 bites of my Pad Thai tofu and (as ashamed as I am of admitting this...) threw it in the garbage. They clearly do not use one of the most important ingredients in authentic Pad Thai, which is tamarind. This is an orangey, sticky type of substance that is similar to honey but unique all its own and without the flavor of tamarind, pad thai just tastes like chili paste -- which is exactly what this dish tasted like. They also made the dish with WAY TOO MUCH SAUCE. The noodles were swimming! It was more like an Udon soup than a Pad Thai dish. I was horribly disappointed, and to wait over an HOUR after calling was adding insult to injury -- even though I was prepared for that issue thanks to the previous reviewers. I was NOT prepared for such an incredibly disappointing meal. I will never return and the only thing I can assume about you positive reviewers is either you've never had delicious Thai food or you are friends/family of the owners."}
{"text":"Delicious, generous portions, great prices, but will test the extent of your patience.  Order way ahead of time before picking up."}
{"text":"Thai Thai is my absolute favorite Thai place in Charlotte. I would love if they brought back the papaya salad. It's hard finding authentic papaya salad in charlotte."}
{"text":"After some roach and other issues at the Thai place down the street and poor health ratings at my other Thai go-to, I wanted to give Thai Thai another shot. I had tried it a few times before and was underwhelmed by their Pad Thai and their Pud See Ew was definitely not yummerific like Monsoon or other Thai places. Other times I've called in and the wait was super long like an hour and we punted.  It seemed to me that if you're takeout only, you should be darn good at it. Like Taipei Express is like a 10 minute wait. Anyways.  This time I called ahead at 6 for a 6:35 pickup and ordered steamed veggies with shrimp and peanut sauce (okay and very thick and sweet but not spicy even though I ordered with 2 stars) and Lard Nar with chicken and broccoli which had a bad taste. in fact I took 2 bites and tossed the rest.   I love Thai food so much I wanted to love this place but the search continues... Hopefully the next place will also have lunch service."}
{"text":"By far one of the best Thai restaurants in Charlotte!  The portions are amazing for the price you're paying and the food HAS FLAVOR! I highly recommend this place for everyone and especially to vegetarians, since I'm one.  I always tell them to take out the fish sauce and they are more than happy to do it.  Very friendly staff and amazing food!    I definitely recommend the following items:  Pud See EW- Just purely delicious.  Pud Thai  Gaeng Dang - Red Curry.  Very uniquely made.  I haven't had this good red curry anywhere.  Gaeng Massamun - really well made massamun curry.    And finally, great portions and amazing, flavorful, food!"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food I have had. Ever.  When I called they were honest and said it would be a while (45 min - an hour) and I agreed to place my order anyways.  And boy am I glad I did!  I had the thai thai fried rice and it was so tasty.  Also, plenty of leftovers as the portions are very generous.  This is high quality food and in my opinion, well worth the time it takes to prepare.  Very friendly staff also."}
{"text":"First things first, plan ahead. There will most likely be a wait, and it most likely won't be on time. If they tell you 20 minutes, just go ahead and add 10 to that and assume it's 30. I've yet to place a take out order here from that's ready in the allotted time. If you go into this with that knowledge, there should be no room for disappointment.  The food itself is awesome. The menu is pretty large, as are the portions. One order is usually two meals. The prices are also extremely reasonable for the amount you're getting.   Appetizers: the fried spring rolls are delicious, the egg drop soup is about average, and the thai lettuce wraps are quite tasty.   Mains: my wife LOVES the green coconut curry (#28 aka Gaeng Keow Wan). I'm pretty partial to the drunken noodle (#66 aka Basil Noodle aka Pud Kee Mao). #65 Pud See Ew (wide noodle) is great if you're not a fan of the basily taste."}
{"text":"Having just moved to the neighborhood, we were in need for some good Thai food to enjoy amongst our newly inhabited home. What's the story? Fire up the Yelp app and find what's close to the homestead. Enter: Thai Thai Takeout.   Do yourself a favor and do a thorough read-through of all of the reviews and tips before placing your order. Great Thai with several \"asterisks\" included. Here's my take:   Was a little confused by calling in our order. They open at 5pm and I called at 5:01pm and the phone kept going to voicemail. Then, I finally entered into a phone battle with the rest of humanity who wanted Thai Thai at the same time as we did. Busy signals galore....Finally got through and placed our order with.....ease? Had to go through our order a few times but felt confident they got it down. She quoted 20 minutes. No problem, right? WRONG. Ran a few errands and then entered the waiting room of death.   Quoted 20 minutes. Showed up 30 minutes after I placed our order, walk in....you guessed it. Food isn't ready. In fact, no one even came out front to say \"Hello! It'll just be a minute!\" There were 5 other folks in the same boat as us. Sad day for all of us Thai-loving folks. After waiting another 15-20 minutes or so in the land of Thai Thai employee desolation, a woman came up to the front and rung us up! Happy day! It was hilarious watching her pick up the phone and hang up on other folks calling in. Goes to show how busy this place really gets. Sounded like there were only two people working behind in the kitchen, too.   So, despite the miscommunications, long....LONG wait, more waiting, and....waiting, and being misquoted on pick-up time, the food was nothing short of awesome. I ordered the Pud See Ew with shrimp. Smoky, thick noodles with a hefty portion of broccoli throughout, sriracha, and a few other veggies. It was magic. Just what was needed for a rainy day, post move in. My wife had the veggie pineapple curry. Holy cow, I wish this came in sports drink form. I'd drink from a squirt bottle! It was delicious. Creamy, mild, packed with veg. Teamed up with a nice bowl of white rice. Food was the jam and we ate it all!   So, the lessons are:   1- Don't believe a word of how long they say it will take. 2- Be prepared to wait even longer 3- Don't expect amazing service 4- Your food will be worth the anguish  Moral of the story: Thai Thai is wonderful."}
{"text":"My fortune cookie was stale. No spice whatsoever as requested. Phone kept ringing and people were waiting too long perhaps under staffed. Good flavors were going though. I would try again, but not during vacation."}
{"text":"Been meaning to eat here for years but I always ended up down the street at Thai Taste. I was stuck in the nearby hospital and thought this would be just the trick to break up the gastrointestinal dismay that is known as the cardiac diet. I called the order in right at 5pm, 3 dishes and they said it would be 20 minutes. Cool.  My runner got there on time and waited another 10 minutes, no biggie as there were orders streaming in non stop while she was there. Got the food and the amounts were huge, no way I was going to be able make any kind of meaningful dents in these containers!   First up, the tom yum chicken soup. Not bad but not the best I've ever experienced. I ordered it extra hot and it was very spicy but mainly just from the hot oil on top, not from an overall flavor profile. The chicken was cooked nicely and there were plenty of mushrooms which I love. A little salty but lacking the oomph of a better tom yum.  Next up the yellow curry with squid. I liked this dish a lot, paired up to the while rice really well (they don't offer brown). The squid had a slight tooth to it which I like and had a nice mild flavor. The vegetables were properly cooked and the spice level was proper at a 3 star. Sauce was a little chalky, just barely noticeable but it didn't bother me one bit.   We also tried the Massamun curry tofu with vegetables. Solid offering of curry here, huge amount for the price. Great flavor and mild heat at a two star provided a great mellow finish to the meal.   If you need Thai food to go in the midtown area, make sure to pay a visit to ThaiThai."}
{"text":"I love Thai food and this is one of the best places to takeout some Thai food in charlotte. The only part I do not enjoy is waiting even after ordering from phone and reaching there as per their suggested time, or may be I just choose the busy weekend night whenever I ordered, my bad. But if you like Thai food, you have to try this place and you will be back for sure same as me. I found all dishes to be equally tasty, nothing specific comes to mind. Order and enjoy whatever is your favorite Thai dish."}
{"text":"Trying to find a good Thai Food place and so glad to have found this place! Great Thai Food! you won't be disappointed coming here we tried their tom yum soup which was amazing and spicy good! best Thai place for tom yum in Charlotte so far."}
{"text":"Fast and plentiful...One night I was craving Thai food, but didn't want to stay in a restaurant or make it. I wanted to eat on my couch, in front of my tv, with my pjs on. Thai Thai Takeout made that happen for me!  I walked in and ordered Pad Thai with a side of rice and within 10-15 minutes it was boxed up and I was out the door. The quality of the food was decent and the portion size was huge! I was able to share it with my husband and there were leftovers.   It's takeout only since the interior only has 3 chairs and no room to eat. Next time you want Thai to go, stop by this place."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place one late night since I saw it driving back to my hotel in downtown charlotte. Was shocked that tigers was anything open and thought I would give it a try since I was in the mood for Asian food and I doubt I would find anything open at that hour. The hours on the store say 10pm, but I walked in a little after 10:15 and they served me. I'm sure it was also because there were people in there as well waiting for their food and I caught them at the right time.   I've never seen a Thai place that was solely take out and thought it was a good place to get food quick if I lived here. I ordered pad se eew which was pretty good. Since they had a seafood option I got the seafood combination and not the typical chicken or pork I would normally get. I thought the dish was pretty good. I'm assuming that if it were normal hours it would have been a little better but i can't complain. Not the best that I have had but it wouldn't stop me from coming back and trying other dishes.   I as well tried the steamed shrimp dumplings. I should have got them fried but  of course I was trying to be \"healthy\" which I seem to regret a lot of the time. The dumplings as well looked like they were mixed in with ground chicken or some meat because it was not all shrimp. The sauces that came with it were pretty good and I think that if it was not as late as it was I would have tried other appetizers.   The thai iced tea was as well pretty tasty and I wish I would have gotten more. Overall I think that this was a good find and if I get a chance I would love to try many more dishes. The employees there were all Thai so I trust that it is all authentic. Of course being Thai myself and growing up eating all these foods I have a higher bar than most people who have only had Thai food at different locations."}
{"text":"Food was great, but the service was incredibly slow. She's going to tell you it takes 30 minutes- it'll be an hour...Everyone waiting seemed irritated because it just took so long to get the food."}
{"text":"This is my go to takeout Thai. Sure, Thai Taste has a nice atmosphere, and Deejai is great, too. However, you can't beat the amount and flavor of the food for the price at Thai Thai.   The Pad Thai is a little saucier than other local options, but the flavor is good. I actually enjoy it chilled the next day for breakfast even (weird, I know). The fried tofu is perfectly soft and crisp. The staff is also very friendly and there's a giant bowl of self-serve fortune cookies on your way out.   My only (small) complaint is that sometimes it can take a long time for the food to be prepped. It does make sense some though, as the restaurant is small and seems to be a family biz."}
{"text":"Good food. Be easy on the spice level because it may be Spicer thank you think. My favorite is the yellow coconut milk curry."}
{"text":"You Want 5 Spicy?   Telling someone how spicy you want your food varies. Sometimes you want wings or maybe salsa. These things are easy to say hot or mild and knowing exactly what you will get, but going to a Thai restaurant and not knowing how spicy they can make it may be hazardous to your health.  Waiting for my girlfriend getting takeout from Outback Steak House I noticed a place called Thai Thai Takeout right behind it. I instantly was craving something spicy. I walked in to this takeout restaurant looking around and seeing nothing, but a cash register and a kitchen behind it. No cheap statues or posters hanging on the wall that are supposed to give you the hint you're in another world.  Upon ordering the pepper chicken I was asked that question that I love to hear. \"How spicy do you want it?\" I wanted as spicy as it could be so I calmly said, \"On a scale 1 to 5, 5 being the spiciest, I want 5 spicy.\" She repeated what I said with excitement, \"You want five spicy?\"  After getting home to my TV set, I popped open the Togo container and started flushing this soupy food into my mouth. After about 3 bites I felt a concentrated tenderness in my throat. Realizing right then I had forgotten how spicy I ordered it.  After two glasses of milk and some bread the food got tossed in the trash and my ego shuttered below normal. When I thought I had a mouth that could take the heat, 5 spicy came along. Spicy or not the food was nothing more than the standard satisfactory."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE. They give you a ton of food for an incredibly reasonable price and the lady who works there is so sweet and friendly. Their preparation can be a bit on the slow side so if she says \"20 minutes\" give it a solid 25-30. Totally worth the wait. Really good."}
{"text":"Best Thai place in Charlotte! The lady who runs it is awesome. I'm disappointed with Thai food from anywhere else in the city. Basil included."}
{"text":"I've been to this place so many times I can't believe that I never reviewed their food. This is a cool take out place ran by a married couple from Thailand. You can't dine in but the food is fantastic. I love their \"Pud Thai\" with Tofu! It is so good and I always get it spicy I order mine at a level 4. The prices are very reasonable and the portions are huge.  If you are looking for good thai food check this place out!"}
{"text":"Delicious reasonably priced Thai food. I was feeling like I was never going to find a place with really good Thai food within 15 minutes of my house (Plaza Midwood) and then I discovered this takeout-only gem.   They make all the standards and make them well and for the right price. No frills, no gimmicks, just good quality food. I really loved my panang curry with chicken and shrimp and the lemongrass soup with chicken. They even did a great job with fresh spring rolls."}
{"text":"Huge portion sizes! My meal fed me three different times. Delicious food and nice staff."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken Pad Thai from here the other night. It was ok, nothing special. I found it to be a bit bland and oily. I love Thai food and may be a bit picky about the quality. But I think there are better Thai places in town."}
{"text":"I've tried getting take out here 3 times over the last couple of months however whenever I call to place my order, no one answers. The phone rings and rings until prompted to a recording asking for a pin number. I am certain that I am dialing the correct number. Each of these times I've tried to order from here (unsuccessfully), I've ended up giving up on trying to get a hold of Thai Thai and end up calling Thai Taste down the road. I have to drive by Thai Thai to get to the other location, and they are clearly open, just not answering the phone."}
{"text":"Small family run takeout only place, hits the spot every time when I'm craving Thai food. I don't need fancy service and inflated prices at sit down Thai places, all their portions are always huge. My wife and I just about always get the clear soup which is amazing especially if you aren't feeling too great. Their curries are very flavorful and delicious. The stir fries I like the most are are the lemon grass chicken and the basil fried rice, they just about always hold true to the spice level that you request. The satay I'm not a big fan of, just about every time the chicken ends up being super overcooked and chewy, the fresh and fried spring rolls are both delicious though and definitely ask for a couple sides of their hot sauce"}
{"text":"I love this place. It is strictly take out and I suggest phoning in your order because they make everything as the order comes in so it takes time. Sometimes 20-40 minutes. But it is well worth it. I usually get the Pud Thai or Pud See Ew but occasionally branch out. Everything I have had is delicious. The portion sizes are huge so I usually have enough for a snack or full lunch the next day and I usually have a pretty big appetite."}
{"text":"This is literally the best Thai food I have had in my life! I live in NYC and crave it all the time. I am yet to find a place in NYC that even comes close to Thai Thai. I'm jealous of all you CLT ppl! At Thai Thai, the food is always packed full of flavor and the quality is always consistant. It's very authentic. This place is a true gem."}
{"text":"Good news: the food was ready when we got there.  ... And that is the only good news we can share :-/  Perhaps we had too high expectations? Food was over cooked - did we not get there fast enough and it sat too long?  Spring rolls were filled with lettuce and bean sprouts, no flavor. Pork was way over cooked.  Vegetables were mushy.  Spices were fare to party cloudy.....  Even the tofu was tough.    So wanted this to be good, as it is walking distance from our Dilworth home..... Oh well!"}
{"text":"Odds are you're reading this because you're looking for some takeout food. Whether you're tired or just lazy, my guess is you're super hungry and don't want to waste time reading reviews. Here you go.  The food here looks good and smells good, but tastes bland.  We ordered panang curry and cashew stir fry, both with chicken. Both came with steamed jasmine rice, and we threw in some Thai iced teas to drink. When we opened up the bag, everything looked and smelled delicious. It wasn't.  Never in a million years would I expect Thai food to be bland. Maybe we didn't order it spicy enough, or maybe the food here just isn't that good. It's not bad, mind you, but it's not anywhere close to delicious. The chicken was kind of dry, the sauces way too mild and the veggies tasted like they came from a buffet line.  If I were you, I'd try to find some place else or just order a pizza. I really wanted to like this place; it's a shame I didn't."}
{"text":"Wow, this really is some good Thai food. Not 5 stars because, like others, I agree that the wait time is a bit silly (if it's going to take 40 minutes, don't say it will take 20). That said, Thai Thai has HUGE portions at lower prices than Thai Taste and Deejai. I didn't believe the reviews (my boyfriend and I can house good food, and never have leftovers from Thai when we order), but my fridge is full of leftovers - we barely made a dent.  Red Curry (#25) - delicious; the shrimp was de-tailed and fresh; less thick (?) than other curries from competitors, but it seemed more authentic to me. Generous serving of veggies in there, too.  Pad Thai - also great; this dish reminded me of the good Thai you can get on the West coast.  Seriously, this is the place to go if you want Thai take out. Super value for the price and portion size. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is written 'to the proprietors' instead of as a review, since they don't seem to have any way to contact them.  Thanks a lot for making my wife wait 45 minutes to pick up our food and then when she arrived, telling her the kitchen \"skipped our order\".  No apology, no token gesture, just 'oops'.  That's great.  I have spent years telling people yours is the best Thai in town.  No more.  It probably still is the best, but I won't be eating it after that."}
{"text":"To give you a little background, I LOATHE carryout.  If I'm going to put on pants and leave the house, I want to be taken care of, not turn right around and drive home to eat and then have to clean up after myself.  Don't get the enjoyment of carryout.  Husband loves it.  HATE it.  That said, Thai Thai is the only Thai restaurant from which I'll eat in Charlotte.  They used to have a brick and mortar in what became a sketchy section of town (which is when I started with them), so they moved to this location and are now only carryout.  Their food is heaven.  We have a standard order:  lots of fresh spring rolls (vegetarian and full of noodles and vegetables and mint leaves with a peanutty dipping sauce that makes me have bad thoughts), tofu tod (deep fried tofu for the hubby with an even peanuttier dipping sauce), pad thai (no onions, no tofu, extra broccoli for me and no eggs for the hubby).  Mmmmmm  When you call, you will be talking to Pim, who is a treasure.  I'm sure her husband, the cook, is also lovely, but I don't interact with him.  Pim will remember you and the vagaries of your order (see above) and is always super perky without being annoying.  Some other reviews mention that she has sometimes been a little optimistic about wait times, but I've recently heard her tell people on the phone \"be over an hour\", so she's getting more realistic.  If you'd like a Thai place in Charlotte that can get you food quickly, I can recommend several, but there's a reason Thai Thai has the wait it does.  THE FOOD.  LOVE THEM.  Sorry.  I'll quit yelling.  You gotta go.  If only they'd get tables...sigh..."}
{"text":"Being in the restaurant business myself, I don't believe in reviewing a restaurant after just one visit. Behind the scenes, a lot can happen on any particular day; and only if things seem to fall apart on a consistent basis should a restaurant really take a \"review hit\" for slow food, poor service, etc. But only after a number of visits can someone be able to review the most important and hardly ever discussed factor behind the over quality of a restaurant: CONSISTENCY.  I have dined with Thai Thai 20- plus times. They get 4 stars for being (overall) hot food, tasty food ( step up your spice number would you- it's Thai food), friendly, mistake free, and price point. Does the food take some time to be prepared because its fresh and other patrons share your craving? Yes. Just try to see a wait at an establishment as a good thing and take responsibility for your own timing and desire to eat. Eat up Charlotte, it's an incredible life."}
{"text":"Best Thai in Charlotte, hands down! I'm a pretty heavy traveler and have tried Thai food all over the planet and this place has it figured out. In fact there are some spices they're using here that are not common in most Thai restaurants. The signature Pad Thai is AMAZING. It's not on the House Specialties but certainly should be. Veggies - bright and perfectly cooked, sauces - aromatic and provoking, meats and seafood - always fresh and uber tasty. This is a take out only place in case you didn't get that from the name. It takes a bit longer from order to pick up but that's because it's the best. Super friendly owner (I'm assuming she's the owner). She's always there and one of the sweetest people I've met here. She has some magical way of knowing who you are when you walk through the door - knows your order and always has a smile. Thank you Thai Thai for picking our hood to set up shop!! Customer for life - Cheers!"}
{"text":"I first discovered this place when I lived off Kings Dr, about 6 years ago. Even now, living on the other side of town, which makes it a further drive (with plenty of other Thai options between here and there) Thai Thai Takeout is my go-to for Thai food.  The location is clean, and easily accessible with plenty of parking. The food is reasonably priced, and I've yet to have a dish I didn't find completely satisfying. I am fairly certain it's literally 2 people running the place: a man who runs the kitchen, and a woman who takes orders and checks people out. They are both very friendly, and even remember my preferred spice level (1 star spicy for this white girl, please) which makes me feel really special for some odd reason.   There are two reasons I didn't give 5 stars. One is that the wait time is insane, and almost always quoted incorrectly (if they tell you it will be ready in 30 minutes, get there in 45 minutes). I am sure this is due to the aforementioned two-person staffing model but can still be a bit of a drag. The other is that my boyfriend, who loves his food spicy, says that even when requesting the highest level of spice, it's not really spicy at all. I am fine with lower level of spice but I know a lot of people are drawn to Thai food specifically for the spice.   Still, if you plan ahead, and don't mind the supposed lack of spiciness, Thai Thai Takeout is a good choice for yummy Thai food!"}
{"text":"Super busy little place! Good location and decent food for the price. You get what you pay for here. We like that delivery is an option since we live close and sometimes don't want to put on real clothes for dinner."}
{"text":"Best Thai I've had in Charlotte thus far. Pad See Ew was excellent - just the right amount of sweetness and the texture of the noodles was brilliant. Also, tried some chicken Larb and was very, very impressed. Definitely on par with my favorite Thai restaurant in the US (Ruen Pair in the Thai Town district of Los Angeles).  Having said that, I'd really like it if they'd expand their menu to include more authentic Thai dishes. I would LOVE to be able to order pork leg over rice or glass noodle soup. But that's light criticism for an otherwise excellent Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"I really want to give this place 5 stars for the food, but the wait was a bit ridiculous.  For a place that is a pure \"take-out\" place, the service is slow.  Could have just been the day, but my friends that live on East actually build in an extra 10mins before going over there to pick up their order.  Now enduring the wait gives you some pretty great tasting thai food.  There is plenty of it too.  A lot of times I find myself wanting more rice since the sauce tends to overpower... but they give you a bunch and I pretty much inhaled it all.  Really the serving is good for 2 meals, but I was really hungry after the wait and not eating anything but a salad all day.  We placed an order at 7:15... and we were out of the place by 8:05.  Granted the poor lady seemed to be working the kitchen and the front at the same time - they could have been understaffed that night....  Combine that with the rainy weather and lots of people wanting thai food = long wait.  Oh well -  I will try you again someday Thai Thai... maybe on a day where I am not rushing to do anything."}
{"text":"I've tried a few places in Charlotte for Thai food to find the \"one.\"  When my sister and I came across this one we had try it and see what it was all about.  I definitely agree about the wait, we were told 30 mins and it took close to 40-45 mins.  Need less to say, the food was good.  I was impressed they would take out the fish & oyster sauce from their noodles for vegetarians, that was a plus for me. One thing I will point out is the abundance of veggies you will get in your dish.  If you don't want an entire garden you might want to ask which veggies come in the dish.  I enjoyed the chili basil stir fry, but I could have done without the 101 veggies in it. I will recommend this place to others, but be mindful of the time."}
{"text":"Amazing & authentic curry dishes, you get enough food for two or three servings at a great price!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food!  Their Pad Thai was incredible. Fast service and the food was very hot when picked up."}
{"text":"I took my fellow Yelper's advice and allotted an extra 20 minutes for take-out and I did not have to wait when I arrived ; ) My red curry with chicken was delicious, though I am still a tiny bit partial to Siam's.   The price was steep (about $13)  but you get a HUGE portion...I ate it for three consecutive meals. I personally would prefer a smaller portion for a lesser price just because my hubs doesn't eat curry so that means I am eating it all weekend.  Overall I will definitely go again, hopefully I can find something my husband and I both like because it's a really inexpensive meal if you can split."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just crave take-out.  Something hot and comforting while you sit in your pjs late at night.  Sometimes spicy, sometimes not.  I consider chinese/thai/indian takeout to be in it's own category of food options, similar to the way I consider grocery store sushi to be in it's own category compared to real restaurant sushi and the way frozen pizza is compared to freshly tossed pizza.  Sometimes you want the former, sometimes the latter.    Thai Thai fits the bill of the latter perfectly.  I've been a handful of times and have tried several vegetarian options of both noodles and rice.  I usually go with \"medium spicy\" as I find plain old \"spicy\" to be a little bland at times.    The price and portion sizes are great for sharing or having leftovers later."}
{"text":"I called in for take out around 5pm on a Sunday and was a bit worried when she said it would be an hour before I could pick it up. But it was worth the wait, this is the best takeout Thai I have gotten yet!  For 14 bucks I was able to get a quart of red curry chicken and a large portion of steamed rice. You can't beat that size/price for take out Thai that I've seen. It was absolutely delicious.   The staff was friendly and even gave a paper plate and a STURDY fork for easy clean up after eating (anyone who has ever snapped a fork grubbing knows a sturdy fork is key).  You're welcome."}
{"text":"disappointed is an understatement!!   My husband and I are always trying new places and we love ethnic food. When reading such great reviews, we thought we had to give thai thai takeout a try. We were disappointed.   First, the wait time is insane. It took 45 minutes for 2 stir fry dishes. I called them in at 5:45 (they only open at 5).   The dishes we ordered were more saucy then I've ever experienced in my life. The ratio of sauce to food was severely disproportioned. I referred to it as \"bobbing for food\" with my chopsticks.   The rice was cold!   This said, the flavor and spice was spot on. Regardless, my husband and I could barely stomach both of our dishes.   We were not thrilled with the experience."}
{"text":"The most important thing you need to know: call ahead and place your order. Well, unless you get lonely at home and would rather sit at a business and wait. Then go ahead, feel free to order in person. You should allow a good 20 minutes at least.   I love Thai food. My go to order here is the drunken noodles. I'm a sucker for those big wide noodles. For me, it's enough to split into two meals. There are five levels of heat: one star - not so spicy, two stars - spicy, three stars - medium spicy, four stars - very spicy, five stars - very very spicy. I usually go level three. I love spicy food, but am a little scared of just how spicy that next star up is. I'll report back when I get brave.   The friendly woman at the counter remembers all the regulars. And a reminder again, speed is not their thing. Add on to that, they get a ton of orders. Seriously, the phone rings nonstop. If you need to kill some time here, go wander around Fresh Market next door. Don't forget to grab a fortune cookie from the bowl!"}
{"text":"Great take out and huge portions.  The prices are great and a great deal.  They serve pretty authentic Thai food so be prepared for the taste of chili and fish sauce.  The lady who runs the place is kind and the chef is magic in the kitchen.  The fresh rolls are great and the Pad Thai is enough for 3 people.  This place is great.  It's take out only so when you don't have time to cook it's a great meal prepared with love and spice."}
{"text":"Much like most other reviews, the food is wonderful here, but double or triple the time quoted. I was told 25 minutes for red curry and soup and ended up waiting nearly an hour. This is a repeat issue for the restaurant. Three people were waiting to get their food when I came in.   Regardless, order long before you know you'll want it because the food here is consistently superior. Worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I love Thai food so I had to give this place a try. I discovered the food here to be decent. I ordered the chicken pad thai. I believe it could use a little more flavor compared to other thai restaurants I have patronized. I called in my order it took at least 40 minutes. Atleast you know your food is made fresh to order. I probably wouldn't return here again."}
{"text":"I have heard nothing but good reviews from this place by my friends. I don't know if I can trust my friends for good Thai food anymore. I was disappointed the food was not good. My family and I are huge Thai food fans and have practically tried all the Thai places in Charlotte and wanted to try the food here. We don't live close to the restaurant so it never came across as an option considering it's only a Togo place, however I was in the area around dinner.   I didn't like this place for multiple reasons  1. They don't have a menu you can order from on their website because their website is nonexistent. I don't know how you are supposed to order to go without it. Even when we got to the restaurant they were out of menus.  2. The food was not good everything was either bland and dry even though there was a good amount of sauce at the bottom almost as it's over cooked.   If I were u I would trust all the other reviews and not go. Not worth it and we tried a good amount of different parts of Thai food. Curry, stir fry, appetizers, and noodles all were a disappointment."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in town!! Great service and generous portion, we usually get 2 meals out of 1 order.  Awesome curry with fresh ingredients!!! The owner is super nice. We love that place. They are dinner takeout only hence the name thai Thai takeout."}
{"text":"Long long wait! The food was not that great..I mean I have had real amazing Thai food at other restaurants around..."}
{"text":"Best Thai restaurant in Charlotte. Huge portions for a great price.  All of their noodle dishes are excellent!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try Thai Thai but did not think it was great at all. The pad Thai was honestly the worst I've had with a lack of flavor, but it was a big proportion of food. We called in the order and still waited for 20 minutes there, but it seemed that only one person working."}
{"text":"Best thai food in charlotte. The portions are huge. Big enough for two to split and still be full. The curry can't be beat its so creamy and flavorful. The pad Thai is the best I've ever had. Try the Thai tea you won't regret it. the service is fast and friendly. Though they do get busier on the weekends. Still I think the longest I've waited for an order is an hour. So if its a weekend plan ahead. Totally worth the wait any day of the week."}
{"text":"Overall I felt the food was good, we have only eaten here once and I had the pud thai and was really good. I also felt they did a great job in getting the spicy levels correct. Most cases when my husband orders thai hot and I order mild...I get hot. This restaurant got it right (thank you)! The spring rolls were good. I will say the wait time was longer than what they said on the phone but was worth it."}
{"text":"Our family loves thai thai, especially the red curry with chicken and the green curry with veggies. Consistently delicious !"}
{"text":"I do  want to update my review regarding them answering the phones. I've had much better experiences my last few times calling in. I've tried a few new dishes too, # 52, 55, pad thai, & 26. Still love this place."}
{"text":"The food is good and the price is affordable but the wait is ridiculous. I waited for 1.5 hrs and when I got there to pick it up, it still wasn't ready. That's completely unacceptable."}
{"text":"Slow service. This is a takeout only place - if nothing else, have the food ready when I arrive at the quoted time (30 min after ordering). There were people there waiting who claimed to have been there for 2 hours.  Orders were coming out of the kitchen piecemeal and not sitting under a heat lamp while the remaining dishes were prepared. Who wants cold soup and a pad thai that has been steaming in a styro-foam box for 30 min?  The entire waiting area was full but the lady in the front was working the line 1 by 1...so the guy in line behind me could have had his entire order sitting there ready and getting cold.  We left after 30 min of waiting (1 hour total after calling in - 30 min time quoted).   Read the other reviews below where people had the same experience."}
{"text":"It has almost become a staple in my household; I don't even need to look at the menu anymore! The fresh shrimp spring rolls, vegetarian tom yum soup, ginger stir fry with chicken and shrimp and a side of hot sauce! I've found a few favorites and am guilty of ordering the same things over and over again. The food isn't fancy - it's flavorful, simple and fresh - exactly what you want for dinner when you're in no mood to cook. The pad thai is mediocre (I am yet to find amazing Pad thai in Charlotte), but I do like the pad see ew noodles. Some of the stir fry's are mild in flavor, but the curries are quite flavorful. On the weekend, make sure you place your order well ahead because it could take up to an hour to be ready. and don't give up if no one answers the phone and you've tried calling 5 times, try one more time. It's a really small family run kitchen, and sometimes it takes a few tries to get someone on the phone. Now, if only they delivered... :D"}
{"text":"Others should not complain about food taking awhile to cook. Good food takes time- even takeout. I  thoroughly enjoyed my takeout from here- it's not fancy but it is well seasoned, portion sizes are all more than enough to share and the owners are so friendly. Be patient! It's worth be wait!"}
{"text":"I like it mainly for the portion size.  I only get the Chicken Pad Thai and you could easily feed 2-3 people with it.   The food is ok but not bad.  The staff is very nice and the prices are good too.  I totally recommend this over Noodle and Company or some other chain."}
{"text":"I usually get the same few dishes on a first order at a place new to me, but that was thrown out the window on this trip. So, I don't know how their pad thai and see ew compare to any of its neighbors, but the dishes we did order from Thai Thai were pretty good. (and the portions were huge)  The Chili Duck we ordered with a 3 star (out of 5), and it had pretty good flavor. Some of the duck pieces were overly fatty but I was happy with the spice level and the flavors. The pud kee mao - basil noodle - (with pork) we ordered at a 4 star. Very happy with it. Awesome spice level, nice flavor, everything cooked well.   I was a little surprised that the \"very spicy\" 4 star never triggered the waterworks. It made me slow down once or twice, but not as intense as I was expecting. (I have a feeling the jump from 4 to 5 is pretty intense, though.) Enjoyable, especially in the company of others, as I wasn't really looking to be crying in my corner of the couch the whole meal.   Also, we called around 830 on a Sunday night and they said it would be 30 minutes (and it ended up taking a little bit longer) Really? Didn't seem to be any other orders being made, but oh well, good thing we weren't starving.  Overall, I think I'm more partial to other thai places in the area, but thai thai will definitely be on my list of options."}
{"text":"So, I wanted to give Thai Thai another try b/c so many others give it higher ratings. Unfortunately I am going to stick with a 3. I am a typical Pad Thai person, but decided to try the Pud See Ew with chicken & shrimp. The portion is anonymous, but just okay. I ordered mild, but maybe I should up the spice, since it is pretty bland. However, I did enjoy the crispy shrimp rolls."}
{"text":"This has been one of favorite places for about 10 years. I go weekly for their soup or pad Thai. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Visited Thai Thai on my way home one night. I called in an order and it took 20 minutes for them to cook the meal. I ordered the Basil Fried Rice and added chicken to the mix. I asked for spice level 3. I wasn't sure what to order, but the lady who answered the phone said it was a popular choice.   I walked into the small restaurant, which has no seating room, and was greeted by chef. She was very friendly and talked to me about all of the dishes on their menu. She recommends the duck, all of the curries, and the Pad Thai. As I picked up my meal to take home, I immediately noticed how much the food weighed. I knew I was getting several meals out of my $10.00 plate   I got home with my meal, sat down on the couch, and was ready to binge watch some Netflix. I  opened my box and was greeted with an overwhelming aroma of spices. There was broccoli, onions, basil, tomatoes, and chicken. The rice was cooked perfectly and the veggies were not over/undercooked. It was hot, but not unbearable. I will try a spice level 4 next time.  I cannot wait for next time."}
{"text":"Thai Thai Takeout, why haven't I found you before! So glad to have an afforable, tasty Thai cuisine nearby.   We ordered chicken basil fried rice and pad kee mao around 9p, our order took about 20 minutes so we decided to do some groccery shopping in the meantime. Upon arrival, we found that Thai Thai Takeout was an actual small takeout joint, there was no place to dine it. This is fine with me if a place can put out good food.   My boyfriend and I were surprised at how heavy our two takeout boxes were. Our food was jam packed with veggies and chicken. I really enjoyed the fried rice but felt like the kee mao was not to the book. The kee mao didn't have as many peppers and onions as I would have hoped for, it seemed more like pad see ew than kee mao. It also wasn't as spicy as I had hoped, I asked for 3.5/5 but got more like a 1.5.   Regardless, we will be back for more. Yay for Thai food!"}
{"text":"The food is worth the wait. Which is, by all accounts, ridiculously long.  Call at 5:00. Place your order. Go pick it up at 6:00 and it should be ready. The whole \"20 minutes\" can't be taken seriously.  I always order a darn good, evenly spiced vegetable curry that fills up a 4-cup deli container. It comes with rice, which i never end up eating because the veggies fill me up so fast.  So adjust your expectations...swing by Bulldog Beer and Wine for a pint or two before you go pick up your dinner and relax. It's definitely a go-to takeout spot for us...just not a quick one."}
{"text":"I have tried this place several times and the food is NEVER ready on time.  They are very disorganized and do not even start your call in order until you show up.  AVOID the frustration and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Pros: Pad See U or however you spell it is one of the best Thai dishes in Charlotte (other than the one at Basil Thai). A bowl full of fortune cookies and a bowl of candy mints to take while you wait.  Cons: The wait! I ordered food at 8:55 and arrived at 9:35 and the ladies were still wrapping up my dish. The place closes at 10:00 and there were multiple people waiting for their food. The ladies were extremely nice, but very slow. It would help if they had two people in the back cooking and another dealing with the customers."}
{"text":"I ordered the Pad see eu. Compare to other restaurants in Charlotte, the dish was okay. I feel like they over sauced the dish. Noodles broke easily. Chicken wasn't cut well and is dry."}
{"text":"I don't really have any complaints.  I got the pad thai tofu and chicken.  It was VERY edible but wasn't my favorite pad thai.  I'd say portions and cost GREATLY make up for it though."}
{"text":"Thai Thai Takeout is absolutely the best Thai food in Charlotte! I've never been to Thailand and certainly cannot claim myself a connoisseur in Thai cuisine, but I do consider myself somewhat a foodie. Thai Thai Takeout's pad thai is packed with awesomeness. I don't know exactly how they make it, but I can certainly taste quality fish sauce and tamarind in their pad thai. If you're used to the sweet \"American-Style\" pad thai that's service in most thai places, Thai Thai will be very foreign to you.   The minimum wait time is usually 25 minutes. Call ahead is the best option. I drive from Concord to pick up takeout from Thai Thai in Dilworth. So, I usually place my order just before I leave home. On busy takeout nigths like Sunday, 1 hour wait time is normal."}
