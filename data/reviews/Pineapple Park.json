{"text":"I literally make  my way here every weekend from North Las Vegas lol I love this place  sooo good, it's a great vibe and a plus for me is they have Dippin' Dots which is hard to find unless it's an amusement park or carnival"}
{"text":"Omg!!! My new favorite dessert spot. Thrifty ice cream and all. I used to have to drive 30 minutes to get that. Love this place.."}
{"text":"I am totally unimpressed with this place. The customer service has been bad both times that I have visited, and the product is not worth the money. And upon reading some of the offensive responses posted by the owner I have decided to spend my money elsewhere. It is a shame, since I am a staunch supporter of locally owned businesses, and I live in the neighborhood. Now I understand why the other location failed."}
{"text":"They have good products which is why I gave 2 stars... We ordered a soft serve and it took like15 mins. Super unorganized line was everywhere and got different answers from everyone working. Granted they just opened but they need to get it together."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!!! Super clean and very friendly workers! So glad we found this :) oh and did I mention, my two favorite kinds of Icecream. Dip n dots and also cotton candy Icecream. Yummy!"}
{"text":"This place is packed.  Its very short staff.  I keep getting asked what i ordered.  The one complaint i have is i haven't seen one employee wash their hands.  They touch the screen as they check us out then preparing your order.  Im disappointed.  I let i think one of the owners know about not washing hands.....the response was sometimes the girls get flustered  Your response is very rude.  You as the owner know you showed up the last five minutes i was there.  I watched you yourself make two shakes touching ice cream and not once washing your hands when you walked in.  There were two girls working both touching the screen, sliding cards, touching the counters and handing items to customers not once did one person wash their hands.  I guess touching money and credit cards dont count right.  Im a local and i live in the area where my family eats often.  As for a fake account its not.  Ive never felt the need to complain about other places we have been"}
{"text":"The place is amazing! I was so happy when I found out that Dole Whip had arrived in my neighborhood! I've been here 3 times since they opened...it's that good! Besides the infamous Dole Whip, they serve great crepes and waffles too. Oh...and Blue Bell ice cream for those looking for a dairy treat. I paid a visit today, and the place was BUSY. I'm not sure why other Yelpers were complaining, the staff was doing the best they could and helping everyone as quickly as possible. It's a brand new business...cut them some slack :-) The owner and his staff are super friendly and make it a fun place to visit...and they have board games too...nice touch!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and was interested in the dole whip. Ordered a dole whip, but had to change my order to a smoothie because they were out of cups.  Ordered dip n dots for the wife and kids.  Everuthing tasted very good. As for the staff and facility,  girl at the counter was showing her bra and with kids around that's a no-no, none of the tables were clean and the trash bin was full.  Two people behind the counter, but one only working while the other person was hiding, which is why a lot of people are complaining about the slow service. I would only come back to this place for their dole whip (in any firm), which is why they are getting 3 stars."}
{"text":"My daughter and I love dole whip, but my husband and son prefer ice cream. Luckily this place has both! Delicious!"}
{"text":"The only reason I went here was for dipping dots. The wait time was almost 20 minutes since only one worker behind the counter and she had to make crepes. The 6 OZ dipping dot cost about $6.50 and with the tax almost $ 7.03. The staff new I had been waiting in the for 20 minutes she presented the check and suggested to if I want to leave a tip?? This is the practice they have at this store to suggest for a tip...really??? why would you even ask me for a tip...not to mention you are charging more for the ice cream anyways. If I want to leave tip that would be solely my decision based on the service I received and never should be asked.  I know I am not going to this place again!"}
{"text":"Every single time i come here. This establishment is ALWAYS out of dipn dots. Every Time they tell me that they will not have them for several months out. Please take the sign down if you do not offer them.  However on the other hand the pinnapple whip is great and the thriftys ice cream."}
{"text":"A friend told me about this place so I came in today to give it a try and got a peanut butter crepe with bananas!! It was bomb AF, every bite just melted!! Coming back for sure to try the other crepes!!"}
{"text":"Food was great! My wife got her stuff first (ladies first) but ate it before mine arrived... would have been nice to eat togther... but it was good...  Girl working was kinda grumpy... not much politeness... felt like we were an inconvenience to their night... We apologize for coming in for ice cream... it was a good idea for us.."}
{"text":"Pineapple Park is our new go to spot when looking for dessert. Everything we have tried here has been fantastic. More recently we opted for something without pineapple and got the bananas foster sundae. It did not fail to impress and is a new favorite. Service is always fast and friendly. I just wish the owner would put one a little closer to our side of town."}
{"text":"First time going to pineapple park with my roommate, awesome. I love pineapples.   We both got the souvenir cup. Apparently it's 50% off refills for soft serve I think! The cup it comes in is super cute, reusable with a tiny lid!   I got the float (tiny umbrella included!) the pineapple soft serve was SO good, it came with a pineapple chunk.  Really refreshing, hit the pineapple craving spot. They explained their options, not to be confused! You won't get confused and think it's ice cream :) Soft serve pineapple!! What else can you ask for?    The staff was really helpful and polite! I will be back soon to fill up my punch card :)"}
{"text":"Dole whip used to be a treat I could only enjoy at Disneyland's Tiki room attraction. Now I can satisfy my craving now that we have one in Vegas!   My favorite is the dole whip float. It's a great-tasting  healthy alternative to ice cream and free of the top 8 food allergens! My daughter has several food allergies and I love taking her there since it's the closest thing to ice cream she can have. She absolutely loves Dole whip!   Kudos to the manager and staff, they are always so friendly and upbeat."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and i've enjoyed every time i've come here. I've been served by Joey and Dev and they've been fantastic! They're both entertaining and extremely nice. They're one of the main reasons why I keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Great times to be had at Pineapple Park! We loved the service, the games, and of course the Dole whip! Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"So, first off everything we ordered tasted amazing of course and  nice big portions. But, the service still needs some help.. 3 girls helped us and seemed confused. Then the owner or manager was called out and he was very rude to his employees.. Tip:let them know you'll be taking your stuff to go before hand so they can get you the appropriate containers :)"}
{"text":"Pineapple Park is amazing! I'm so happy my roommate and I discovered this place! She's a gluten-free vegan and I'm a vegetarian that prefers vegan options when available, so this place is perfection! They have multiple dole whip flavors and wonderful customer service!   All flavors, including the vanilla and chocolate are vegan, gluten-free, and even fat free! So far I have tried pineapple, raspberry, vanilla, mango, and orange. They didn't have chocolate both times I visited unfortunately. :( All of the flavors I've tried so far are good, but my favorite is the pineapple! This is my first experience with dole whip, and it's everything I imagined it to be and more!! I haven't had anything like it and I'm so happy they will be opening a store closer to me! I will definitely buy the souvenir cup next time I go :)   The service is great! We were always greeted with a smile and even a generous sample the second time we came here. I can't wait until the one closer to me opens! That will probably be bad for my wallet..ha.  The pineapple boat is also a good value at $10.95 and worth a try! You can get 3 flavors of dole whip and caramel sauce on top with pineapple chunks and a cute little umbrella. My only complaint is that the pineapple we received should have been carved out a little more to give room for the bowl and so we could eat more pineapple ;) it's hard to dig a plastic spoon into a cold delicious pineapple.   See you soon Pineapple Park!"}
{"text":"Ordered a float and it was delicious! Very festive and tropical decor, service was nice!"}
{"text":"Where should I start? I've been to this place since it's birth at the Boulevard & it is by far the best dole whip I've had since Disneyland. And not to mention the great customer service & the atmosphere is definitely worth bringing your friends & family. So if you haven't had Pineapple Park's dole whip, don't miss out!"}
{"text":"Oh yeah! The perfect spot to bring the kids after a day at the pool. The staff remembers the kids favorites and always make them feel so welcome...we really look forward to our visits! The choice of soft-serve or ice cream is great & the crepes are a welcome choice for us \"adults\" to enjoy.  A family favorite!"}
{"text":"I took my son here after I picked him up from school for dippin dots. The place is clean and everything they sell looks delicious. What made me write this review is the fact that there was a guy working/training there with ear rings, wearing a hat with make up on. I caught him picking his nose a couple of times and licked one of his fingers while we were in line. Unfortunately he was the one serving without wearing gloves. I asked the girl working the cash register if she could please fix my son's order instead of him. I don't care if the got mad at me. They are dealing with food and should be careful who they hire. For as long as this individual keeps working there we're not coming back"}
{"text":"Heard about this place from everyone raving about it. We came in and we're probably the first customers of the day. The music was blaring and the ice cream machines were going full bore. We had to yell our order and the employee still couldn't hear it and even he said it was too loud in there. When we tried to order fountain drinks, the employee told us the soda dispenser isn't working and the photos are flat. He told us to buy a soda from the cooler, because it would be cheaper. The sodas in the cooler were in mini bottles. We were told that there was no ice. They were waiting for a delivery.  Doesn't make for a relaxing lunch break. As for the food, the crepes were nicely done with great ingredients. The floats were delicious. That's a shame the business cannot be more organized. Very simple things that could be easily corrected."}
{"text":"pretty good, I  want to come back and try the mix of strawberry and pineapple, portions are good but you must eat at the store. the to go portion is small."}
{"text":"Not even 15 minutes before closing and the guy told us that he couldn't service anything he was a fucking prick. Machines are up and running in the stores are all still open but yet he was closed and they drained all the fucking machines. Next time I have one I'll be at fucking Disneyland fuck this place"}
{"text":"Great Service from the staff (Robyn,Dev and Makala).  Great dole whip, I had no idea that dole whip had other flavors besides pineapple. Definitely the place to go to get your desserts in the suburbs of Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"**Update  I'm sorry, I just don't understand how the owners of this place can be so completely unable to run a business. They advertise dippin dots but legitimately, literally never have them. Advertised in the window. Advertised on the sign outside the store.   Anyhow, I digress from this place's complete inability to keep items in stock. At least they carry Thrifty ice cream. If only the store was open as advertised on the Internet and on the store front. Open until midnight on weekends as advertised? Wrong. Closed at 1030 on Friday night.   God, this place is the worst."}
{"text":"My daughter and I entered an empty establishment on May 29th at 5:55pm.  One individual behind the counter appeared less than happy to be there.  She had long blond hair that was not pulled back.  She served my daughter her order with a piece of her long blond hair on the side of the cup.  Another women who apparently was working in back did have her hair pulled back.  I asked to speak to a manager and was told no manager was currently there."}
{"text":"Delicious I got the pineapple upside down sundae; it was amazing. Good service, I wish they had one of these places in California! My family also enjoyed a great tasting pineapple and strawberry whip and a crepe that was awesome!!"}
{"text":"Got an instant reply for my post!!She did ask the manager and she was the one who said they cant honor it.Anyways ill be back sometime to redeem it.Additional stars  for the immediate attention. :)  I got a voucher from yelp for this place and i tried and use it today and the cashier said \"we dont use yelp anymore\".Huh?! I just paid for our order but anybody please help me  redeem my $30 voucher!"}
{"text":"Saaweeeeettttttt. Love this ish so much! Dole whip though, thats some good ice cream. Had their cold hot chocolate. Totally killed it in this vegas heat. Multiple returner here"}
{"text":"Ok, I always see adverts regarding this, so I decided to see what the hype is all about. I came on a Sunday, so it wasnt packed. They have a ton of choices, but I wanted their smoothie. I ordered the Dole Whip- I didn't realize that it would be slightly pricey. But nonetheless it was perfect. On a hot summer day in Vegas this is perfect! Its sweet and tangy. I just wish it wasn't cold outside! Great place for a smoothie, the cashier was very friendly. Gonna keep coming here!"}
{"text":"I fell in love with Dole Whip last year. Since then, I have tried to make it and failed, but when I discovered this gem, I didn't have to try anymore.   The dole whip is just as good as California. It's creamy and full of pineapple flavor. Or, you can choose another variety. They swirl the whip into a cup, so the center is hollow.  The only downsides to Pineapple Park are the location (I am not a fan of ever really going to this mall), and the price (it seems a little high for both the location and the quantity). But if I am craving dole whip, at least I now know where I can go find it."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. The employee who helped us was full of enthusiasm and she knew the menu very well as I had asked her for recommendations. She gave us samples of the different flavors. She also took the time making sure that the product presentation was as good as it tasted. I am very excited to try this place again; especially when summer time comes. I highly recommend trying their Dole pineapple soft serve. I also tried their banana split with pineapple, mango, and strawberry."}
{"text":"Love everything I've tried.  Now they have a nice boba tea menu.  My favorite is the Banana Foster."}
{"text":"Between the amazing flavors of dole whip and the mouth watering crepes with fillings like Nutella or cookie butter you can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Again a lack of training. I was never offered a thing. The girl in the shorts helped us. I finally asked what do you have and she asked the man in the white jacket he said vanilla. It was never explained what vanilla was. I again asked for several different flavors on the menu board and again she said all we have is vanilla. The place is very dis organized. I appreciate your offer. It was extremely frustrating since we do not shop at that mall and my husband wanted to do something special and surprise me. Not sure why I was given a lecture. I stand by my review. Bad service and lack of communication."}
{"text":"Ignore the negatives! Just come here if you're a big fan of Dole Whips and can't afford to go all the way to Disneyland or Hawaii to get one. You'll be good. :)"}
{"text":"First time tonight and never again: I walked in at 9:00pm and the guy behind the counter and a girl in the back making who knows what never made eye contact or anything till he finally goes to the back to make a crepe next to the girl. 10 minutes later I'm already pissed and complaining the guy comes out and ask what I want. Well first I want a manger. He tells me come in tomorrow she will be here all day. Well good I'll be here second I want dole whip in a regular cup Togo. He rings me up and gets gets me my dole whip. I took it and left.   Come on are you serious you have 2 employees. 1 employee should make crepes and the other should be the cashier and scooping or getting them ice cream.  Will not return"}
{"text":"Worst crepe I've ever had, very disappointed! I ordered a Nutella, strawberry and caramel crepe. The order was ready on time which was great. However, the crepe sucked it was so dry. They were WAY skimpy on the Nutella. They also forgot the caramel. Tasted like a slimy tortilla with a lick of Nutella."}
{"text":"Finally stopped in and WOW! Great selection of menu items, very friendly service and overall super-cute establishment. Came in for the Jasmine/Peach/Agave with Boba (a recommendation from a frequent customer)..... very refreshing and enjoyed the Dole Whip sample as well. Will be back - with friends! :) :)"}
{"text":"Growing up in Hawaii, my boyfriend & I loved visiting the Dole Plantation with our families. As locals though, you never really visit tourist locations unless you had visitors (Just like us Las Vegas locals who rarely go to the Strip). When we moved here, we always had random Dole Whip cravings, especially on those extremely hot Las Vegas summer days. We would always talk about how much we regret not getting enough Dole Whips as kids & we should have cherished the opportunity back then. We only satisfied it once here on the mainland during a trip to Disneyland & we were in Dole Whip heaven!   I think my boyfriend & I almost cried tears of joy upon finding out about Pineapple Park LV because we are Dole Whip fanatics & with its huge success & fan base, I'm glad it is here to stay. They have the friendliest owners & such delicious choices on the menu to try.   I think I should end this quite dramatic review for Pineapple Park & look at the photos since I have a random craving right now. :) In conclusion, GO VISIT PINEAPPLE PARK. Alooooha!"}
{"text":"So happy they have their first brick and mortar place and not just a stall in a food court! These guys deserve it.   Don't fret; the sign, decorations, board games, tv and more seating will be coming up in the next week or so, according to the owners. They have the usual sweet, creamy dole whips in various flavors that you can customize into floats, banana splits or smoothies. Try their delish crepes and waffles or pair your whips with the equally yummy Blue Bell ice cream and much more.   Purchase the plastic pineapple souvenir for discounts (and because it's adorable, of course), check in here, follow them on social media for updates/announcements/deals and take advantage of their stamp cards which they will utilize real soon at this location.   I'm an avid fan of local businesses here in Las Vegas and Pineapple Park is one of my faves. Everyone needs to #GetWhipped, for sure. :) Congrats Pineapple Park LV!"}
{"text":"Dole Whip!... and I don't have to go to Disneyland to get it!!  Even though, I'll only come here when the Dole Whip craving strikes, they do offer many other types of sweet treats - ice cream, dip n dots, and crepes.  The only disappointing part was that service was quite slow and less than enthusiastic. I suppose it's understandable because there was only one person working with a shop full of guests."}
{"text":"The person taking our order looked like and spoke as if she hated her job. She said she was unable to use the mango flavor dole whip for a float. She was also unable to sell the pricier pineapple souvenir cup. There were also no spoons available. I ate my dole whip with a straw. I would give one star but maybe this was just an off day? I had a very confusing time however it was kind of funny. My group and I had a good laugh because of the horrid service and the food was regular which is better than bad so two stars for you.   Also, there's a blue bell sticker by the ice cream display."}
{"text":"The only Dole HWhip spot I know about besides Disneyland.  Pretty good dole hwhip ! I actually love the different flavors.   We usually order half mango/half vanilla for a nice contrast of sweet and not so sweet!  If you like the tanginess of Pineapple though,  go for the traditional!  Service varies but what Do you expect...its not the Hilton"}
{"text":"I honestly love this place. Both my roommate and I went out of our way to get to this place because we happen to LOVE the business owner's \"snarky\" responses to people that don't understand what their business is about. We loved how real she was and wasn't just kissing ass & apologizing. This is first and foremost a BUSINESS. Not a handout. So to everyone complaining, either suck it up or go tell this lady what you think directly to her face & stop hiding behind a review site.   ANYTHING you get at this place is delicious. Good luck choosing!"}
{"text":"I think this place is pretty good when you got a coupon for it on the back of your Smith's receipt. We have a Dole cannery in Hawaii and coming to pineapple park was my best hope of finding something similar to dole whip here in Vegas.  I'm surprised to say it's borderline comparable! I guess it's just not the same when you're eating it in Hawaii and when you're eating it in a dessert. But it was good enough to quench my cravings on a hot summer day!   The area was cute and organized, very clean. They have indoor and outdoor seating as well. I only came across female workers and they were very friendly as well. I'm gonna have to give this place 3 stars though, only because I feel that it's overpriced for what you get. It's good once in a while when you want a good cup of dole whip, but I would not pay that price on the daily, honestly."}
{"text":"I'm not so sure about this place. The employees always look unhappy and bothered to help you. The dole whip is amazing, but hard to mess up. Last night I ordered a large \"Dip N Dots\" and it came out to almost $10. That is ridiculous pricing and I never complain about pricing. My fault for not asking but in no way did I imagine it would be more than $5. They are lucky to be the only one in Silverado ranch with soft serve."}
{"text":"Pineapple dole whip. This place is yummy! Also got sparkling ice in coconut pineapple. Awesome service by the ladies!!"}
{"text":"It was pretty good at Pineapple Park and we were excited to go, but the girl was rude and it was very expensive! The young tennager girl taking our order was impatient, rude, and short with us. It was our first time there and they had a wide selection so of course it took a few minutes for us to decide what to get. If the service was better, I'd maybe go back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing ! The pineapple dole whip float that you used to only be able to get at Disneyland is now right down the street from me! There are so many options; thrifty ice cream, frozen hot chocolate, crepes, dole whip! They lay out is so cute there's games, a photo booth, a chalk wall you can write on. Favorite place to quench my sweet addiction!"}
{"text":"Ok so first of all I had some concerns but wanted to discuss in private with the owner....we had ate icecream here on 5/25 2015. Tried to call and let them know my concern ask the person who is a guy to speak with the owner he immediately got all defensive asking what is the reason and I stated it was a concern and asked again to speak to the owner then he said he is the owner in a mean loud way....i asked him politely not to speak to me in that tone he then went off and said \"go fuck yourself you bitch\" ok so now I'm pissed..... it was just a concern call wasn't judging in anyway just wanted to make sure they were informed of the recall.   To all the costumers who had their Bluebell icecream report them ...because in the bluebell recall it says that the establishment shouldn't be serving or selling the recall icecream......  This was supposed to be a friendly thing that I wanted to only cause people have gotten sick or have even died because of the bluebell products. Like I said tried to make this a private matter instead of being on all the Internet.                                                                     http://www.fda.gov/Food/RecallsOutbreaksEmergencies/Outbreaks/ucm438104.htm"}
{"text":"3.8 Great stuff, the shop runs out of portion cups  And dole whip (pineapple)  Gotta up your game a little Plus For the $ could be a bit better with having cups in stock or an upgrade would be satisfactory... Just sayin  No complaints on product it's flippin fantastic  And it's better than most ice cream... Kudos"}
{"text":"Great! I am lactose intolerant and I love their selection of Dole Soft Serve. Every time I come to Vegas I always make a point to stop in here. I really like the new location as well. Staff was friendly and the manager honored our coupon from the other location as it had closed early. 5 out of 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy!! We just can't get enough of this place. My kids love it here and we love the various menu options! Every time we go we are greeted very well by the owners and employees. I love that they have Bluebell ice cream options and there prices are very fair with there portion sizes. I think it's perfect timing with the weather warming up."}
{"text":"I'm confused by other folks' reviews of this place. It seems like people either think 1) they are the only people in the world and have grandiose ideas they're special or 2) that they are walking into a Joel Robuchon restaurant for dessert and expect to have 3 people serving them.  It is a small frozen treat shop next to a Smith's in a suburban strip mall. Where I come from, these places are traditionally staffed by teenagers and they're just places to run in and grab a treat and go home. Why are people trying to make it a dining experience?! Also, if you see a long line somewhere and are that pressed for time, WHY would you get in the line and then fire off a nasty gram on Yelp about it?!  Here's my take on it: The Dole Whip is spot on. It was 101 degrees outside and it was still the proper frozen consistency and the flavors were great. The place was clean, even the restroom, and the girl working on Thursday afternoon was very nice and efficient. There are signs advising that crepes are made from scratch and take some time. (Another red flag for you uber-important people who simply can't wait in a line.) I'm glad it's moved close by and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The Dole whip float hit the spot. Delicious & refreshing. Thanks for bringing this to Las Vegas. The staff was courteous and the clean."}
{"text":"We came in last Saturday afternoon, peak 100 degree weather and what a great decision to come in and try their famous pineapple dole whip. Simply awesome! Refreshing, not too sweet with of course, the delicious pineapple. I'll make sure to try their pineapple upside down on our next visit to LV in August. Customer service a little on the two dimensional side but who cares right? Kids will be kids and they'd rather be somewhere else than working. I was a little hesitant after reading bad reviews and jeez the owner sure chases after all the negative ones. Kind of in poor taste and she should have thicker skin but again, who cares. This is place is worth the stop. Just don't expect 5 star customer service."}
{"text":"Saw this on Eater Las Vegas...  We drove over to it and as soon as we entered the employees were welcoming , knowledgeable, giving suggestion and going above  and beyond to make your visit  enjoyable.. We tried the dole whip swirl, mango/strawberry & coconut/pineapple.  They were good portions, refreshing and filling.  It was very busy and yet everyone was taken care of, they kept up with all the orders and were very happy doing it.. You do not see that much any more.."}
{"text":"Ok to start we did show up 18minutes to closing and the girl working made sure we knew 18 minutes to close. We asked about the dole whip served inside the pineapple and she quickly tried talking us outta it....probably because it was now 16 minutes to closing. So we just got it in a container to go as planned. The dole whip was good but the service was horrible. Not only because it's located outta my way but I won't be back just because of the service."}
{"text":"Went to pineapple park for the first time the other day since a friend told me that they had dole whips and dippin' dots there. I was initially very excited since rarely do you see dole whips outside of Disneyland and Disney world, not to mention my son is a big sucker for dippin' dots, so I decided to drive over there after I picked my son up from school as a nice little surprise. The dole whip was good-- good flavor, just like disney's, and the dippin dot's were, well, they were dippin' dots. No complaints in the food aspect! However, I must say the customer service is extremely lacking. We came in and no one else was there, and the girl behind the counter just gave us this cold, icy look, with nary a greeting. I tried to be nice and polite to her, but she was very aloof, and it almost felt like we were inconveniencing her by being there. I said thank you, of course, after she gave me back my change and after we got our ice cream, and not once did I hear a peep from her. It was just so uncomfortable.   Also, I read some of the reviews on here before actually trying out the place, and the replies the business owner made were very off-putting. It almost feels like she is overly defensive over the littlest critiques of some, if not most, of the reviews. I do wish they'd train their employees more on proper customer service. You don't have to be all peppy and cheery, but a little smile sure goes a long way!"}
{"text":"Dropped by today while on vacation to get my dole gluten/diary free fix. Friendly atmosphere and great customer service- I wanted to try a few flavors and they had no problem at all in offering me a few tasters. My other have was like a kid with the dip n' dots and the old school coke bottles! Will definitely come back next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Owner is very nice. Kids LOVED it!! The dole whip reminds me of Disneyland but better!! Can't wait to come back again and again!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome!!!!! Lots of variety and a great place for allergies too!  Fun for kids too!!  Tastes amazing, low fat, and great service."}
{"text":"Is this place still open? I drove all the way from the strip to indulge in some pineapple whip and it was closed. Yelp says it's open until 10pm....???"}
{"text":"Came here cause my friends were visiting from Pennsylvania and they really wanted to get some Pineapple dole whip (like the ones they have at Disneyland) and this place definitely did not disappoint !  The service was a tad slow, only one person working on a Saturday afternoon.  My friends got the pineapple float which they liked a lot !!! But their float was pretty small compared to mine and theirs was a little pricier I got the pineapple & vanilla soft serve and the worker gave me a huge portion!!! Totally worth the 5 bucks ! However between the two flavors I just liked the pineapple one (tastes just like Disneyland!) and definitely would skip vanilla next time.  This place is relatively far from the strip so you would need to drive here, but it's worth it if you're craving some Disneyland pineapple dole whip!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place out because I had  nothing else to do on a Sunday night (late hours are a plus) My friend and I shared a dole whip and both got our own crepes. While we waited for our ordered, we played Connect Four from their board game collection. The Bohemia  Bri-Berry was alright; I wouldn't come back here for this though but let's face it... there's no close crepe place in southern highlands. The dole whip reminded me of Disneyland so if I ever miss Disney and their dolewhip  I know where to go. Do I think this place will out last the other dessert places in Southern Highlands (Dairy Queen, Cold stone, and that froyo  place are all but a memory here)? Probably not but I'll enjoy the dole whips it while it lasts. I'm sure in the summer it will pick up."}
{"text":"Great Dole whip and other frozen treats! Located in the Smiths shopping center! We had a very positive experience, thrifty brand ice cream, lots of sweet concoctions! We highly recommend this place! The service was outstanding!"}
{"text":"I've driven by this place for weeks and I finally decided to go in, and let me tell you it is amazing."}
{"text":"I never had a bad experience, maybe I never go there at a busy time, not sure. Understandable that a small ice cream shop would only have 1 person working. It's not like the ice cream shop at the Linq or at Town Square or on the strip somewhere that stays super busy all day everyday.  Large selection! Dole whip near my home is just perfect!"}
{"text":"Reno DeVito of Pineapple Park created the best store in Vegas! And their store and ice cream is AMAZEBALLS!! I LOVE their Dole Whip and they are literally have  the BEST tasting ice cream and treats!  Reno and Mary are the kindest people and will treat you like family and appreciate their customers. HIGHLY RECOMMEND and there just isn't enough stars to give them!!"}
{"text":"I am a frequent whip lover, but over the last couple of months I am really disappointed with Pineapple Park. Not only is it $5.35 for a dole whip, which I totally don't mind paying. The problem is over the last month the portion size is incredibly small. I even saw the girl weighing the portion size. Every time I go it gets smaller and smaller. The last time I went it was five regular bites?! The whip was barely even touching the sides. I think I will go to purple penguin or golden spoon from now on. Sorry, but if you are going to charge that much, your customers should get more than that!"}
{"text":"So nice to have a great dessert place close to home. So many different options to help any craving. Thrifty's ice cream is my favorite and I was so pleased to find out they had it there. Their price is a bit higher than other places but they make up for it with excellent customer service. I've met both owners and they are very kind. The facility is always clean and tidy. They have fun board games to enjoy and it's also a pokestop. I'm definitely a huge fan! :)"}
{"text":"We decided after reading some negative reviews about the customer service, that we'd give it a try anyway. Showed up at 10:05pm, and were turned away despite the clearly printed text on the door that read a closing time of 11pm ( in addition to hours listed as 11pm on yelp as well). The door was open, yet 3 employees annoyingly exclaimed that they were closed.  Went to Smith's next door instead, and watched another couple get turned away in the same manner 30 minutes later. I wonder why they didn't bother putting up a sign, or at the very least, locking the door. We will not be returning as it is clear that they are currently lacking structure and professionalism."}
{"text":"Pineapple Park has a great variety of sweet treats to choose from. From dole whip to thrifty's ice cream to crepes and more. It's a cute little shop with convenient hours and board games to play at your table. Awesome place to take the family. It best to avoid peak hours as the service can take longer, especially when crepes are ordered. But service is very friendly and they do their best to serve as quickly as possible."}
{"text":"If you want some good dole whip, this is the place to go!! Aside from phenomenal customer service, the place is clean. Great place for a nice date, or hang out after work after a long day!"}
{"text":"I spent $20 on 2 pints of Dole Whip because it was supposedly the \"better value'\".  Got home and found both pints are hollow.... Next time I want Dole Whip I'll just go to Disneyland, it might just be cheaper!"}
{"text":"Robin and Trae helped me get my ice cream and were very helpful, great ice cream shop!"}
{"text":"Opened on Friday The 13, me and my husband were lucky to catch them not so busy. Upon arrival, we were greeted with a friendly staff. It being our first time, we were able to sample, and that was nice. Flavors are delicious - Dole Whip, as popular in such places as Hawaii, or Disneyland. The texture is creamy, smooth, sorbet like taste ( pineapple, and strawberry flavors I tasted), and it's gluten/dairy-free/kosher/lactose ( can't feel guilty around pool season) ;-) JK. They even serve Blue Bell ice cream, if you're craving dairy. Obviously I had to go with the pineapple mixed with strawberry dole whip, it was very refreshing with the Vegas heat. My husband had the frozen hot chocolate, which was made with the chocolate dole whip, it tasted like a frozen hot chocolate, and they topped it with marshmallows (hard to sip through the straw, but cute touch). We also shared a banana Nutella crepe, no disappointment. I can see why they get busy, it's a cute place to bring the kids, family, and friends. A yummy place to cool off. Definitely will come again, hopefully we'll get lucky on it not being too busy. If not I'll take it home since, home is close by."}
{"text":"Some of the best frozen treats I've had in Vegas! I love fruit flavored desserts and treats which is basically all they sell here. The menu consists of soft serve in flavors like pineapple, mango, and raspberry as well as fancier treats served in a cored out pineapple like the bonzai and pineapple boat.   The soft serve is full of flavor and dairy free and comes in your choice of a cup or waffle cone for $4.95. The bonzai and pineapple boat are around 10 bucks. Don't forget to get a punch card too to get a free soft serve after 5 punches   This location is inside the Boulevard Mall food court and is the only reason I ever come to this mall. I hear they're opening additional locations in the future! Can't  wait until I won't have to drive as far!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. There needs to be more locations! We drive from Summerlin when we have the opportunity.   If you're a fan of the famous Dole Whip at Disneyland, then I promise this place will be your new addiction, without the 4 hour drive, $100 admission fee and long lines.   Get there now and give it a try. They also have other amazing flavors. And crepes mmmmm.   Follow them on Facebook and Instagram for their daily deals too!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try again. Wish I would t have , there's just something off in there mixture or something. The dole whip taste extremely chalky. Nothing like Disneyland's dole whip. Oh well maybe I just came on a bad day."}
{"text":"It is fair. We were very excited to get another outing location in Southern Highlands. The product is good, not better or worse than other like places, but I do believe the cost to value is off and overall not very customer oriented. We have one size, take it or leave it. Two adults, two kids under 10, two whips, two sundaes and down $28 bucks. Snow cones across the street, Dairy Queen has arrived and frozen yogurt around the corner soon - I do hope they branch out the menu a bit not with what they have done by pushing more products, but with more selection. Even the employees were apologizing about the one and your done menu."}
{"text":"I only had a taste of the cheesecake crepe and that was amazing. I also tried their pineapple banana split boat, and most of what was on there was a bit sour but I'm not complaining too much about it. All in all, it was a yummy experience and I would definitely recommend it to others.  Update: this was my second visit and I was not very pleased with it. First off, when we walked in we were greeted but once we got to the register, she like stared at us. I work in a fast food industry, and we get in trouble for not greeting customers with the \"what can we make for you today?\" I don't know about everyone else, but I think it's common courtesy to greet the customers when they come in and when they come up to the register. Also, we were sitting for about 10-15, thinking they were still making our crepes, but no, they shouted across the store and was like \"hey! Your crepes are done\" I mean, you asked for our names, you couldn't have called it out? Don't ask for our names if you're not going to call us when our order was done. AND on top of all that, from when our crepes were sitting on the counter, all the workers just stood there, socializing with each other. What kind of service is this? Shouldn't customers come first?"}
{"text":"4 stars now because of the manager Alex! I went back there again for ice cream, but decided I would try their Thai boba again. I told him it was watered down and the boba was dry the last time I went there, he said he'd let me try the tea and see if I liked it. And let me say, he was super kind! He made sure he got my order right, and made it the way I wanted. He also (for my trouble) gave me a punch card half way to free!! The tea is exactly how I wanted it, but most the boba is still tougher than other boba places. (At least it's not dry in the middle anymore)   This might not be my regular boba place, but I will come back here soon!"}
{"text":"Great price but I really only liked it because of the yelp deal: $5 of $10 worth of stuff. The prices aren't bad to begin with. ~$5 for a pineapple float, which is pretty large, I'm just not a huge fan. It's super tarty. I think it would have been better a bit more creamy.  The girls that helped us out seemed a bit confused about the yelp deal. They weren't sure how to ring it up but eventually figured it out. They were nice!  I think I'd be more likely to come back here if it wasn't located inside the food court of the Boulevard mall. I used to love this place as a kid but it has since gone downhill. It's also not as convenient, not being in a standalone spot."}
{"text":"Dude.... I thought I would only get Dole Whip if I traveled to Disneyland or went to some random Food Festival. This place not only has Dole Whip It has Thrifty Ice Cream. Do you know how hard it is to find Thrifty Ice Cream!?! What's even better is their Dole Whip comes in different flavors like pineapple coconut strawberry mango and lemon. If you got a Dole Whip hater in your group they also do vanilla soft serve. The guy behind the counter was Reno. Super nice guy. We told him we've never been in before so he took the time to explain what they offer. He even gave samples! Clean? Yes. Lots of choices? Yes. Fun environment? Yes. Price is reasonable? Yes. If you've never been you need to stop in and see what they got. They've got a freaking half pineapple banana split boat! Definitely going again."}
{"text":"It's a decent ice cream parlor, that also offers the Dole Whip soft serve. I guess this is something special and not available everywhere. I'm personally more excited about the Thrifty's ice cream when I go in. It is nice that they offer multiple brands of treats, Dippin' Dots, fresh made waffle cones, crepes, etc."}
{"text":"Loveeeee it! Vegan dairy free & gluten free ! Can't get any better!  I love the half pineapple and half strawberry! Always take the biggest size and share with my son!"}
{"text":"My Dole Whip was amazing. The perfect blend of sweet and tart. Boyfriend got a chocolate crunch shake, and he said that was amazing too. The place itself was cute with its tiki theme. They had some games in the corner, which I think is a cute idea. The employee on duty was very sweet and patient with us as well.   My only gripe about the place would be that the signage was out of control. There were two signs posted regarding crepe wait times, one about coupons, and another one about Dippin' Dots tasting policy. It was just out of hand and made the place look unorganized and cluttered. Also they have eight pictures of their sundaes laminated and strewn about their counter looking like a cluttered mess, as well as a sign with their Dippin' Dots flavors which was littered with day dots noting which flavors they were out of. I just think most of that information could be conveyed by the employee on duty without all the signs making the place look tacky.  I also read the negative reviews about this place on Yelp, and the responses from the owner almost made me stay away from this place. As a restaurant employee myself, I take Yelp reviews with a grain of salt, and try to remember that not everyone has a spectacular day that they would want to be rated on every single day. Some days are more stressful than others. That doesn't really give a business owner or manager an excuse for writing smart ass comments back to a reviewer. Both restaurants that I work for has one person in charge of responding to Yelp reviews, and 100% of the time, they apologize for any inconvenience or any misunderstanding a guest has with their business. It is not a manager or owner's place to tell their guests that they are stupid, and doing so is not a great way to run your business.  Regardless of how awful the management is at this establishment, I would definitely return. They have a wonderful product, and I will circulate nothing but positive reviews about their hourly staff as well as their treats."}
{"text":"Everything's amazing here! Love their pineapple dole whip!  I bought the souvenir cup because I plan to continue coming here & you get half off when you bring it back on a Monday-Friday!! Seriously reminds me of Disneyland's pineapple dole whip!! & Joey is amazing, very helpful & friendly"}
{"text":"Dole Whip without having to go back home to Hawaii or Disneyland?? Absolutely awesome...  This place is awesome and is THE PLACE for an after dinner Ice Cream/Dole Whip!  I'd type more but I'm gonna eat this before it melts!"}
{"text":"They have dip in dots so it gets a automatic 5 stars service is good also and I live down the st"}
{"text":"First time here and had the pineapple dole whip and chocolate covered banana. Pineapple dole whip is so good! Cute little spot and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I'm a fan! Finally, Dole Whip outside of Disney and Hawaii. Not the imitation Pineapple soft serve you get at the Hawaiian festivals here. Bonafide Dole Whip is various flavors. I love pineapple and strawberry.  My Fam are Blue Bell Fanatics and we're happy they serve it here. I tried their Gone Bananas crepe tonight, and it was delicious. I'll be paying for it at the gym but at least there was a party in my mouth while I ate it hahahaa.  My hubby got their pineapple float today and it was pretty yummy. His first time, because every time I get it at Disneyland, I never share lol.  Going back next week to try their frozen hot chocolate. Excited to try everything on the menu omg I sound like a fatty!!   Owners are so nice too! Thanks for opening one in Souther Highlands. Best wishes and much success to you guys."}
{"text":"If Angels came down from heaven and started a business, and they made it a sof serve business,  it would taste like this!!! The combination between the whipped pineapple and the pineapple juice is perfection. Its the same as the one in Disneyland but sans the annoying kids, horrible lines and the $90 entrance fee. Do your self a favor and come here instead."}
{"text":"I love Dole Whip Floats.  So we had to check out Pineapple Park.  They have so many flavors that I have never seen raspberry, strawberry, mango, orange and lemon?  Also have chocolate and vanilla soft serve.  That is seriously something for everyone.  Pick your base and go from there, cup or cone, sundae or banana split?  They have many toppings from fresh fruit to cookies and candy to add if you'd like.  They currently have 2 locations and a food truck.  Would love to see a new location or the food truck in Henderson soon."}
{"text":"OMG...The only other place I know of that serves these delicious whips is at the Tiki Room in Disneyland.  We had the pineapple and the mango whips.  To die for!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy can't wait to go back it will be a summer sweet spot for sure!!! Glad I don't have to travel all the way to Disneyland!!!"}
{"text":"I tried a Foster's banana sundae.... AMAZING !!!!! Staff was friendly and they do have a variety of ice creams. From dip n dot, dol whips and regular suspects of flavored scoop ice cream. I can't wait to go back and try a new treat."}
{"text":"A nice alternative to frozen yogurt or ice cream.  Intense flavors - mango is really good!  Little on the pricy side for regular consumption but certainly good for a treat."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday for a nice treat.  We ordered a Dole whip, coconut pineapple Thrify's ice cream, and a crepe.   The crêpe was good, but I didn't think they spread out the brie enough. They did give you lots of whip cream on the side and it wasn't short of Nutella. The banana to strawberry ratio was off, way too many bananas, not enough strawberries. Sorry, I forgot the name of it crepe!  The Dole whip was delicious. It tasted just like Disneyland / Disney World, unfortunately without the nostalgia. They had other Dole whip flavors, but I did not try them.   Thrifty's ice cream is always delicious. The employee was even nice enough to let us sample a flavor they had in the back.   I'll try a different crepe next time, but I would totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place nails it! I had the dole whip float.  It was great! just like Disneyland but no long lines and you don't have to stand in direct sunlight. Devo does not do well in the sun. Mrs, Devo had the banana fosters sundae which was also amazing! The staff was friendly and the decor was  nice on the eyes."}
{"text":"Very delicious!!!! I got the double flavor of the strawberry and pineapple in a Pint!!!! IF you use the check in on yelp you'll get 10% off and there was a deal going on that day,and came out to $5.00 not bad at all!!!! Great deal!!! Definitely worth the try! They even carry thrifty Ice cream as well (old school)   Check this place out!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I have bad luck or what, but every single time I try this place they are always out of the things I want. This is the fifth attempt (across 2 years) and I won't be having them again. Every single time something is out. The milkshakes seem to be the only thing I can ever get. At least they are very good."}
{"text":"My second visit was today and I was extremely disappointed , the place was empty and after my family received  our order the two employees made their way back to the kitchen, only to remain in the back during the remainder of our visit. At one point I open the front door thinking they would come back out to assist but unfortunately that was not the case. It's pretty sad because I did like this place, perhaps they should hire some help, not someone collecting a paycheck for the summer."}
{"text":"There stuff sure looks good but after driving out there it was closed.  Hours were listed as 12-10 and it was 12:30 so I am not sure if they are still in business or what happened.  I hope not because my kids were raving about it."}
{"text":"I heard that Pineapple Park has Dole Whip.  Could it be true?!?  After a visit, yes and no.  They have what they call Dole Whip in several flavors.  Unfortunately, it's a different mixture than what the Dole Plantation in Oahu Hawaii serves.  (Also, at the Dole Plantation they only have 1 flavor- Pineapple).  It's the same stuff that is sold in some of the ABC Stores in Oahu - more frozen pineapple sorbet, than ice cream.  It's still good, but if you've ever been to the Plantation, it doesn't compare.  They always serve other treats like crepes, dippin dots, and bubble tea.  The place is clean and the service was good!"}
{"text":"Closed on Sunday a 3:00pm-ish?  Still in business?  Sure would have been great to have a Dole Whip in 110 degree weather.  Bummer."}
{"text":"I love the Pineapple Dole Whip! I went in today to purchase gift certificates for a contest I had between my students. The girl at the counter said she was the manager and that they can only do gift certificates through an app and I have to know the e-mail addresses of the students! No kidding! So I left, looks like another ice cream business gets my money! I can't believe it's a year later and this little local place still can't do gift cards! So sad."}
{"text":"I have never been treated so rudely by a restaurant in my life.   The sign outside said back in 5 and 20 min later he showed up. Told me to come back when they opened and no hours posted. The worker should never be working there. Terrible place!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We went here the other night and all I can say is holy slowness. 2 young ladies working on a Friday night is just bad planning. We got our treats pretty quickly but it got busy. None of us finished so I wanted lids for our ice cream. My husband stood in line for 20 minutes and never got recognized. He ended up finding lids near the spoons and grabbed those.  I am not impressed. Get those poor girls some help. Only 1 of them was able to get ice cream while the other one was stuck in back making waffles or whatever it is that needs to be baked. I don't understand why someone who works for this business would come on Yelp and start attacking my review. Good luck keeping your business afloat in Vegas!! Ice cream shops are a dime a dozen our here."}
{"text":"Me, my son and my mother went to this establishment because it was hot and something cold seemed like a good idea.  My mother was unfamiliar with what there was to offer although there were pictures that doesn't tell her the ingredients.  The guy behind the counter could never be mistaken for an over achiever if you know what I mean. My mother got the strawberry flavor soft serve stuff and after she finished she spent several trips to the restroom. My son got the pineapple flavor and he was okay.  What more can I say."}
{"text":"No words or picture can even start to express how amazing this place is. Definitely a must try. Especially their Pineapple Boat Split. Omg mouthgasm"}
{"text":"Meh. I've had better from my local yogurt place which was had more of an authentic taste like the dole plantation in Hawaii and Disneyland. Here ...it's was cold and it tasted meh. Nice attempt. I've consider myself a connoisseur of dole whip ...my own creation tastes like here so it wasn't as fulfilling as the other reviews. Thus my input.  It's hard when I spent so many days of my life at the dole plantation in Hawaiian filling up on dole whip....the price wasn't too high for sown thing I can create at home. The service was blah. Not enthusiastic. Not fun not interesting just blah. Just an ordinary yogurt shop. The shop do NOT deliver as like its others reviews. It would have been a two stars but the girl who helped us did say have a good day as we were leaving so she gets a third star for being meh. And trying to make up for it."}
{"text":"I need one of these in Kentucky...seriously. Different that most ice cream shops. Awesome."}
{"text":"What?!? Pineapple Dole whip outside of Disney... score!  This place was recommended by a friend who lives in Vegas and for being a cute little shop in a Vegas strip mall this was such a treat! The Dole whips in pineapple, strawberry and chocolate were good but our service was tip top! They answered our million questions, gave samples and offered us a loyalty card. I hope we get back there soon!"}
{"text":"The pineapple float was delicious. Fast and good service. The soft serve by itself was good, not as good as the one from Disney but it does the work.  We also tried the strawberry and mango soft serve those have good flavors too. It's awesome that we have this place nearby . Definitely will be back for another float!"}
{"text":"Came here with 3 girlfriends and there was only one person working. It got pretty busy but Christy made sure she apologized for the wait and always told customers she would be right with them.  Pineapple park has crepes, waffles, thrifty ice cream and dole whip! You can put your own toppings on the crepes and sundaes. My friend ordered the bohemian crepe which came with bananas, strawberries, brie and Nutella. I wasnt sure how Brie would taste in the crepe but it was pretty good. It does take a while for the crepe to be made. There's a sign that says 5-7 min depending on how busy it is.   I got the pineapple dole whip float which was about $6. It came with pineapple juice which I wasn't too fond of because the pineapple juice wasn't sweet enough for me.  Christy allowed us to sample whatever we wanted. I tried the mango, coco loco (?), pineapple and fruit punch dole whips. My favorite was the pineapple. The coco loco tasted too much like Malibu for me and the mango had a powdery aftertaste which I wasn't too fond of.   My friend built her own sundae with vanilla and pineapple dole whip. She out strawberries, pineapple and peanuts on top. It was delicious!  The prices aren't too bad, considering I've paid much more at downtown Disney in CA and in Hawaii.   Christy told us about the Perka App where you can download onto your phone, scan your receipt to keep track of your purchases. After 10 dole whips, you'll get one free!   They have a few tables and a lot of games you can borrow while you're enjoying your ice cream or dole whip!"}
{"text":"There dole whip is awesome, reminds me of Disneyland. Now they sell boba drinks I got a pineapple, mango, and Thai tea and the reason I gave it 3 stars is because the mango was good but the pineapple was okay and he even had me try it to see if it was ok, but the Thai tea wasn't good at all. That's one of my favorite flavors at other places, but it seems like they don't have specific proportions of flavoring to make it taste right, they just kind of wing it. The new management there needs to taste their own product if being made by hand to figure proper taste proportions."}
{"text":"Tera  worst greeter very rude not helful and not friendly at all... awesome ice cream but worst service"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. REALLY. The ice cream is great. The soft serve is great. However - every time we go in - EVERY TIME - someone ahead of us orders a crepe. Crepes take SO LONG to make - and there is no one else to help the rest of the customers. I've witnessed people come in, wait 5 minutes and leave since there is no one greeting them from behind the counter. Last night, there were actually 2 girls working (yay!), but they still couldn't get the line moving.  On to our order - we ordered 3 items, all listed on the flavor board: strawberry and coconut swirl soft serve, caramel pretzel ice cream and birthday cake ice cream with a topping. We were met with \"sorry, we are out of coconut soft serve...\" - ok, change to pineapple. Then, a few minutes later...\"sorry - no caramel pretzel...\" Seriously? Why advertise that these are options if they are not? It takes a few seconds to erase a flavor from your boards so people know what you ACTUALLY have.  The last issue - just one garbage can. And, not near the door so you can throw your trash away on your way out. Nope. It's situated near the back of the store - so you can weave through the line of people to throw away your trash, then weave through people again to leave.  We've tried and tried and tried to go to this place for dessert, but because they just can't get the flow of customers, we will head to Dairy Queen across the way from now on. So disappointing."}
{"text":"After leaving the Pure Aloha Festival we decided a Dole Whip was in order.  The line at the festival was way too long.  Pineapple Park was a short drive from the Silverton so perfect.     A really nice location in a fairly large group of stores and restaurants.  The inside is bright and very clean.  The seating area is small but luckily a table was open.  The do have a couple of tables outside.      We decided on a couple of Dole Pineapple Whips and the wife wanted the Banana Foster.  The Whips were spot on and were the same great taste I remember from the Dole Plantation in Hawaii.  I got a cup but it was loaded with the delicious pineapple goodness.      The staff were very friendly and got our order out quickly.  The prices were reasonable for a Dole Whip.  I will gladly return during the summer months for a refreshing Whip to help cool down on the triple digit days ahead."}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical after reading some of the reviews, but my husband and I enjoyed our Dole Whips. His was strawberry and mine was a combo of pineapple and vanilla. I expected the pineapple to be sweeter, but the tartness went nicely with the vanilla. The kiddie size ($3) was perfect and very refreshing on a hot day. There was a big sign out front proclaiming \"Under New Management\". The girl behind the counter was very nice and the store seemed very clean."}
{"text":"Came to this spot a little over three weeks ago! This is literally pineapple heaven! I got the dole whip float and absolutely satisfied my pineapple craving! The service was quick & the staff is very friendly.   Only gave them 4 stars because the sitting area is sticky. I'm really big on cleanliness of an establishment... Maybe it was just that particular night that the tables, chairs, and games were sticky. Whatever the case may be, they need to do more frequent cleaning around the establishment. Otherwise they would have received 5 stars"}
{"text":"I live right down the street from this place so I find myself here more often than I'd like but for good reason, it's amazing. I've only ever gotten the different dolewhip flavors but that's all I need. They also have dippin dots, ice cream, waffles, and crepes.  The only negative thing I have to say about the place is that any time I go there's only one person working which is fine when it's slow, but when there's a line the wait can be upwards of 20 minutes. I'm never in a rush so it doesn't bother me but I could tell a few people in line were irritated."}
{"text":"I heard so much about Dole Whip so I Googled it and found it at this great place.  The man who helped me behind the counter (I think he was the owner) was so nice and explained the whole Dole Whip story to me as well as the flavors and gave me some samples. Did you know Dole Whip is non dairy and only 90 calories per serving? You would never know it once you taste it because IT IS DELICIOUS and tastes just like soft serve ice cream. They also offer the Thrifty Ice Cream brand (which is the best!), crepes, smoothies, dipping dots, frozen yogurt and lots of other delicious desserts but you must the Dole Whip. The store is very clean,  bright and pleasant.  I could not decide on what flavor to get and the man behind the counter was so nice and patient and did not rush me..... I will be returning."}
{"text":"Yum!! I lived in Hawaii but only in Disneyland did I ever have Dole whips and I am soooo excited to have on close by to me in Vegas.  They also serve Thrifty ice cream here. Good place for the kids to enjoy as well!"}
{"text":"Always great ice cream. Joey and Trae were great help at making a new ice cream choice. Instagram post get 20%off. Apple cider for the cold season it was tasty. Frozen Hot Chocolate taste great. Great time with family and always treated right."}
{"text":"First time here heard about it because my sister said they had dole whips just like they do at Disneyland and who doesn't love those?! So we decided to try it on night. The establishment is adorable it's very quirky, cute and bright colors. It has a Hawaiian theme and tropical, and they had cute leis hanging everywhere. They have ice cream and soft served and slushes. I ordered a pineapple dole whip and it comes with pineapple soft served and pineapple juice with whip cream and a cherry! I was also a little hungry so I had a chocolate crepe. It was pretty good honestly a little burnt but hey crepes are hard to master so it was still yummy. After we paid they had this cute photo op machine where you could take cute photos and they had things to dress up in. It so fit in there theme. I will defiantly come back again because t was so fun and refreshing"}
{"text":"The chocolate waffle cone was delicious. The service was great and price was perfect for the amount I got!! I will 100% come back, I've got to try the smores crepe!"}
{"text":"I was in the neighborhood and came across the store and came in 15 mins before closing to fulfill my sweet cravings. Waited 5 minutes before the lady could take my order. As soon as I placed my order, she refused to make me an order of crepes when they closed in 10 minutes. I did see a sign that said that crepe orders take 5-7 minutes, therefore I don't understand why it would of been an issue to make it considering I was the last customer of the night and the store was technically STILL open for business.   I can totally understand if she wanted to close up the shop already but she didn't have to do it with such an unprofessional attitude to go along with it. She made it clear she wasn't trying to stay a few more minutes for new customers with the face that she made. Disappointing customer service."}
{"text":"\"So I don't always eat DOLEWHIP.....but when I do it will be at Pineapple Park forever more\" LOL!!!!! So not exactly like the beer commercial but this place is absolutely one of kind. I have been to SEVERAL Dolewhip establishments around the country and this location BY FAR has the greatest presentation. Now all Dolewhip is pretty much the same especially if it is made correctly.....however what sets Pineapple Park apart from other establishments is the again the AWESOME presentation. I mean the wife and I walked in the place and it  was spotless.....bright.....and very welcoming. The owner (Brian).....forgive me Sir if I got your name wrong......LOL was completely awesome as well.   I had the Pineapple upside down cake Sundae with DOLEWHIP of course and my wife had the Bananas Foster and they were in a word DELICIOUS. I highly recommend those choices but just a simple cup of DOLEWHIP will satisfy you as well.....I guarantee it. Now this location is a little bit off the beaten path of the Vegas Strip.....and there is one down there as well to.....but it is definitely worth the trip. So get your butts down there people and enjoy one of the best treats on the entire planet and remember to Eat, Drink and be Merry my Friends!!!!!"}
{"text":"Dole. Whip. Sundae!! And I didn't need to be in Disneyland for it!  Sammy and Dev made the best recommendations! We will be coming back the next time we're in town! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Walked out of this place today, after picking up the kids from school, sometime after 3:30p.  We have been coming for months, as we pass this way on our way home, daily, & my kids love the pineapple whip. There was a guy in the back, cutting bananas. There was a couple already in there, eating. We waited & waited, the employee never came out of that back room to greet us or take our order. I could see straight into the back room & we were all talking so I know he could see & hear us. Both my son & myself used the restroom, still nothing. We were there waiting, at least 15 min & never got helped at the counter, so we left. I guess we'll just go to the new place in Silverado Ranch to get our pineapple whip."}
{"text":"Still good! Just I decided to try the Strawberry dole whip and not as good.....SO stick to the pineapple dole whip! I might try some other flavors next time, but I'm not impressed with strawberry and it's usually my favorite to try. Soooo sad about it really!   They don't let you use groupons, $5 for $10 deals, etc when you buy the souvenir cup but you can use it when you get the 50% off the refills. Just something to note before you buy it thinking you'll get a better deal on their souvenir cups."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Pineapple Park. I got the dole whip float and it was amazing!! I received awesome customer service and I will definitely be back! I recommend this wonderful place to everyone! It's vegan, organic and gluten free so there's something for everyone."}
{"text":"I stopped here for dessert after having dinner next door. Priced at $6.95 I ordered a \"Dole Whip Float\" and the girl who took my order was friendly. The float had pineapple soft serve, pineapple juice and a pineapple spear complete with a cherry and mini umbrella. The pineapple spear was fresh and delicious! It was a refreshing treat. They have a punch card where you get a free cup of dole whip after 6 punches. I you like crepes they have those and make them right in front of you. The crepe menu looked pretty good. I hear they are opening other locations around town, so I will look forward to trying a crepe and having a place to get a dole whip float that's hopefully closer to my side of town. Even though I hope for a location that's closer to me, I'd still stop at this one again when I am in the area."}
{"text":"I was so happy to find out this place existed and even happier to know how close it was to my home. Typically, you can only get these at Disneyland, and since I moved from Southern California last year, I could no longer get my bi-monthly fix. The price is great, and they even put a slice of pineapple in their floats (Disneyland doesn't even to that, so that was a super bonus). I hope this place stays around forever, because coming here is way cheaper and more convenient than me having to drive to Disneyland and renew the annual pass. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I went to the Dole Whip Plantation in Hawaii about 10 years ago and haven't had Dole Whip ice cream since and this place brought me right back to Hawaii! Excellent quality and good service. I want one of these right next to my home!"}
{"text":"I love Pineapple Park!  Dole Whip is my FAVORITE thing in the world.. I frequently visit the Southern Highlands location :)"}
{"text":"I've been to this place three times now since they've opened. The first experience was good. It just took a while for my order (ordered the \"gone bananas\" crepe and a pineapple dole whip). On my 2nd experience, I brought a friend with me. We ordered two sweet crepes to go & it also took quite a while. Tonight (on my third experience), it took even longer.   The girls working here are very nice, however, they look like they're all in high school and I haven't once seen a manager/supervisor (or anyone that looked of age to be one). On my most recent experience, I ordered a sweet crepe to go. Prior to ordering, the cashier was taking such a long time chatting it up with the customers (again, she was very nice), I actually saw two groups of two behind me walk out. I wish they'd have a supervisor on that can push these girls to expedite service, while maintaining their great personalities. They were also out of to go boxes this time, so I had to carry the crepe home on just a plate. They were also out of pennies for change.   I would love to give this place another review soon, as I absolutely love their product! The dole whips and crepes are seriously delicious. And, the girls are super nice. Just wish I didn't have to wait 20minutes for a crepe or carry it home on an open container.   Just a suggestion: add some barstools to the high-top counter for some additional seating!!! Maybe with some hooks on the wall so the ladies can hang their bags.   A few minor improvements and this place will be a great \"go-to\" spot!"}
{"text":"Service is extremely slow, and we were only the second customer in line. Finally get a chance to order, just one Dole Whip and it's taking over 5 minutes....and waiting....waiting.....ok it's done, yay....then the girl throws it away and starts over!!!!! So back to waiting......waiting.....waiting. Yay it's done again!!!!! So yummy, tasty and amazing. Just like the ones from Disneyland & Disneyworl  Fix the radio ...it's awful...all static And add more seating indoors, it's a weird setup.    Wow!!! You would've thought I left a one star review with Brooke's comment after my review!!! 1.The line at Disneyland is not 1.5 hours long for a Dole Whip, even during the busiest season!!! 2. This is not Disneyland!! It's Southern Highlands, not compare able! 3. No reason to respond in such an abrasive manner for a 4 star review! 4. You've now just earned yourself a one star review!!"}
{"text":"This place is probably the best desert place in town.   Indulge in the great flavors of their awesome tasting flavors of soft serve ice cream, without the guilt of all the calories. Awesome customer service! Wide range of selections on what they carry in the store.  You wanna be healthy, eat healthy.  You wanna be bad, be bad!  Awesome customer service. The owners know you by name by the second time there. Love it !"}
{"text":"I have came to this place so many times and each time the crepes are different depending on who makes them. I've gotten some really horrible ones and some really good ones. I've spent hundreds of dollars at this place because I love their Bohemian Brie Berry Crepe, and so I purchased a 3 GROUPONS to use there and they took the first two and when I went to use the third one, the same guy that rang me up a few weeks ago that ALLOWED me to use my GROUPON on my crepe, told me I couldn't use it on crepes and it was only for soft serve and desserts. I explained to the guy that I go to that location all the time and he was the one that rang me up last time and let me use my GROUPON. He got an attitude and rudely told me that it wasn't him, it was someone else and I can't use the GROUPON  (that I PAID FOR, and you would think that after going to that place twice a week for a whole year, you would recognize who is ringing you up and who you darn customer is!!!!!!!) Then he says, \"I hate to turn you down because of that, but that's what it is\". Are you kidding me! I've spent so much money at this place on myself and for my family, and bragged about the crepes, and your telling me I can't use ONE GROUPON, THAT I PAD FOR, after you took two of them already??!!! Get the heck outta here. You just lost one great loyal customer! Do not go to this place with high expectations. The Bohemian Brie Berry Crepe is very good, but customer service is horrible and the only reason I went so much was because I was in love with that ONE crepe."}
{"text":"So yummy! I would recommend the dole whip float it has pineapple juice, soft served pineapple, and a pineapple spear. Or if you want a crepe they are good in size and I would recommend the bohemian Bri berry it has Bri cheese, banana, strawberry, and Nutella spread. The prices are great for these types of desserts too."}
{"text":"Saw their ad when I went to see the movies a few months ago. Then after going to Disneyland last month I was thinking, hold on! We have a place nearby that sells Dole Whip in Las Vegas! I need to check it out! So, i did my research and then I checked the place out and it's nice. I like it. Prices are decent. When my friends from cali visit, I take them here. it's a bit a ways from the Strip but this location is nice. My Favorite would be the Mango and Orange Dole Whip selection. But they also have other Flavors as well as Thrifty Ice cream, Dippin Dots and other Sweet deserts. A must check out! :D"}
{"text":"The family really enjoyed our desserts! Everything was totally yummy,  and the employees were incredibly friendly. Negatives: they took orders from everyone everywhere near the counter, so that was a bit disorganized,  and they were out of waffle cones, Blue Bell Dutch chocolate ice cream, and apples. Still not eniugh to give it less than 5 stars because there were enough other delicious choices. Also, we used our Yelp deal, which made this an awesome bargain!"}
{"text":"I felt really welcomed by Samie he was a great help and he explained to me an item on the menu I enjoy his customer service and I will happily go back"}
{"text":"Holy guacamole, Batman! I am in love with this place! I first had Dole Whip in Disneyland (cause you have to when you're there, duh) and have been wanting one even semi close to it since then. Well what do you freaking know! There is one now!!   You guys don't understand, my mom and I went to the Boulevard Mall JUST to have Dole Whip. Totally worth it! I felt like I was in Disneyland! (Minus the sound of the Tiki Room and little kids begging to go on Indiana Jones). My mom ordered a Dole Pineapple Boat and dude, it was bigger than her face! It's a legit pineapple as a bowl! And in that bowl, was heaven. Chunks of pineappley heaven.   Seriously, I would recommend going here. Their prices are extremely reasonable and it tastes like a wonderful party cloud in your mouth. I'm in love. New favorite. Definitely taking the best friend here."}
{"text":"Great little place to pick some good flavorful sorbet, ice cream or gourmet smoothie for the hot Vegas summer."}
{"text":"I just want to say how delicious the dole whip is here. I'm so glad that they opened up near my house. I love that it's gluten free, fat free & most importantly for me, lactose free. I could eat this every day if I could. I love the frozen hot chocolate. I had a mahalo Cookie Monster crepe as well. I have also tried mango, vanilla, raspberry, pineapple on different occasions. It's so good & it doesn't hurt my stomach. Win win!  The owners are so awesome & everyone in there is so welcoming. Very chill in there.   I just have to say, pineapple park is the place to be. They have a big chalkboard wall of fame, Tv's, nice big booths.  They also serve blue bell ice cream, make delicious crepes & you can make your own waffles all day on Sunday. How cool is that??? Love it!"}
{"text":"Ammmmmmmmazzzzzzing! I love the crepes, the soft serve and my absolute favorite the Banana Fosters that's made to order. I have never had one thing here I didn't like. If you're looking for an ice cream shop with both the classics and some fun extras this is your spot."}
{"text":"The customer service here was excellent, however management obviously has not trained the staff properly.   The place has a general dirty feel to it, and there is really no explanation to exactly what you're ordering unless you ask the customer service representative on the other side of the counter.  What was most disappointing for me is that I just basically paid seven dollars for something that would cost me no more than four dollars at Dairy Queen. In addition to that, upon eating my nondairy pineapple yogurt, I realized that the center was left completely void of the yogurt!  So essentially, you really are only getting half of what you paid for because the center is completely empty. Therefore, I cannot recommend this place.  Once again I don't think it's a problem with the employee or employees that I dealt with but it's a problem with the lack of training by management and the lack of oversight by management. This place does have potential to be successful, however I just don't see it being around for much longer if it continues down this path."}
{"text":"Huge servings!  Got a half pineapple half raspberry and couldn't even finish it.  Will definitely be back often."}
{"text":"My son and I love this place it has something for everyone in the family. The kid loves the dole whip and I'm nostalgically in love with the circus animal ice cream by Thrifty. They also have waffles and crepes for the colder months but I'm down with ice cream all year around. Oh and there's icee here!!! Met the owners and they are super sweet and hospitable. I've also been served by the other employees which I can understand by the other reviews but come on!! You're buying sweets! Just be happy!!! :-)"}
{"text":"Waited and waited. Two people working. Standing at counter like dead meat. Walked out as I walked out sir can help you now. NO THANKS. Won't  be back DQ across the street"}
{"text":"These guys are awesome. I'm in here at least once a week, but mostly multiple times a week and they're all super sweet and friendly and welcoming. Money well spent every. Single. Time."}
{"text":"Server was helpful & friendly. The pineapple dole is ofcourse yummy. Tried luau punch, very good! I'll get it next time. A little pricey for size. They also have thrifty ice cream. Cute place"}
{"text":"I ate their crepe and the batter of the crepe is good! Will definitely be back for another crepe. Service was good and the girls that were working were very nice."}
{"text":"It really saddens me to have to write this review, because this store has so much potential.  I had come in here earlier today based on recommendations from my fellow yelpers.  When I got there I was unsure of what to order and the menu was not easy to read or understand.  We ended up buying a dole whip float and it was pretty good for the most part.  When I approached the cashier about the Yelp check in offer, which is a free refill based on the Dole Whip Float, which is what the ad says...I was told it only applies if you purchase the float with souvenir cup.  I wish this would have been explained to me prior to my purchase, I might have splurged a little.  Looking at the other reviews and based on my own personal experience, the ownership has obviously never done retail business before.  They should have just honored the coupon and this would have been a 5 star review and kept me coming back like a typical drug addict.  However, this was not the case and based on the snarky remarks from the owner on other reviews, it just seems like it's all about money and not the experience.  They were also out of mango and dressed in regular street clothes, which makes it difficult to distinguish employee vs customer.  Regardless, I will not be coming back.  If my fellow yelpers have a better experience and convince me to come back, I may update my second visit."}
{"text":"What a total change of service from the last encounter I had with them in the Boulevard Mall.  My previous experience was awful and the owner comments made me not to visit, however the young lady working yesterday around 5:30 PM was so pleasant to deal with and very nice to my son and I.  I had ordered the strawberry and pineapple dole whip mix (16 oz) and it was delicious.  My total bill was $5.35, pretty good deal.  It was ordered and served within three minutes tops!  They also have toys for kids and card games - pretty cool and inviting for families.  I also noticed they now serve dipping dots.  I will definitely try that next time I'm in the area.  It looks like service has improved greatly and I plan on making more visits."}
{"text":"Been on a Dole Whip kick since my last Disneyland visit a few months back. I've had Dole Whip in several places around town, but if you are looking for the closest thing to Disneyland's famous Dole Whip...this is it! This is the right flavor and consistency to rival the whip served at Disneyland. Some places claim to serve Dole Whip, but it's just not the same. This place has it! If you are a fan of pineapple Dole Whip, you won't be disappointed! They carry several other flavors of Dole Whip as well, including chocolate, which is very good too. This place is a bit of a drive for me, but it's worth it! The staff is super friendly too...can't wait until they open a location closer to me!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time- not worth the wait and definitely not worth the money. Go next door to Smiths and in the freezer section you'll find amazing treats that won't give you attitude or bust your wallet. Oh, forgot the DQ around the corner."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and thanks to my experience tonight, I will NEVER come back.  My first trip was great, ate my delicious pineapple dole whip there, and was satisfied. Tonight, I want some to go and literally get 1/3 of the amount because it's to go.  All I could think is \"Are you f'ing kidding me?\" I thought $5 was already pushing it but at least when I ate there I got a good amount.  But to charge me the same amount and give me a fraction of the serving, F YOU!  You have lost my business and I am really suggesting people think twice before going here.   You'd be better off just going across the street to the Purple Penguin or to the Dairy Queen when it opens soon.  Mr. Hayden only likes to get f'd by Mrs. Hayden...after seeing the owner's response I just had to come make some additions to my review.  Here goes:  You ma'am are the one not being honest. Yes, your cups are the same size but I watched your employee scoop 2/3rds of what she originally put into the cup into the trash once I mentioned it was to go, so she could get the lid on it.  I even commented about not getting as much when it's to go and all she did was give me a shrug and a \"yes\".  So I've gotta call BS on you there.    Next,  I did know going in that the whip was $5. I was fine in spending it. What I had said was that $5 is a little steep.  As in, steep for a plain hollow soft serve with no toppings etc.   You seem to get very personal and butthurt whenever someone criticizes your establishment. That is a consistency you have.    As far as out of my budget, you don't know what I can and can't afford.  You have no clue what I do for a living or what's in my bank account.  By even broaching the subject you show how petty, vindictive and low you are.  And now everyone who reads this will know the exact kind of person you are.   I am honest in all of my reviews.  I never ask for freebies or discounts and the fact that you come to that conclusion makes me laugh.  We are all food critics and there is nothing sinister behind what I wrote. The whole point of Yelp is to get regular people's opinions and with your attitude I guarantee this won't be the last negative review that your business receives."}
{"text":"I had the Worst experience at pineapple park the staff was rude gave me attitude.  Every time I have gone there seems to be an issue with be able to debit cards  but that's only when certain people are working."}
{"text":"We are visiting from California & my son has life-threatening food allergies and we ran across this place. They had so many varieties of Rio safe soft serve we had to come back for 2nds!"}
{"text":"So this is the mythical dole whip that you can only get at disneyland huh? I have never had dole whip before and have never heard of it until hearing all the buzz about this place.  I stopped by after getting off work and decided to go all out and buy the pineapple float in a souvenir cup. I also took a pint of dole whip home so my better half can get a taste as well. I guess we'll be coming back because its frikin' AMAZING. She loves it, our two year old loves it(he started to cry when it was all gone), I love it!! The ladies who helped me were very helpful. I get confused when toppings are an option. I'm not much of a toppings on my yogurt/icecream/gelato kind of guy but the chunk of pineapple just sets this cup o' happiness into the next level. Gratitude pineapple park! I knew I bought this souvenir cup for a reason! See you soon."}
{"text":"Omg this place is AMAZING!!! I got the Pineapple strawberry smoothly and my taste buds are loving it!!!!!!"}
{"text":"First time there and never going back.  We got there and there were only 3 people in front of us.  We order 3 crepes. After waiting 30 mins, one of the girls said they ran out of one of the main ingredients so my husband agrees to replace it with another fruit.  It was taking again longer than expected, so my husband went to check what was going on since we had 2 out of 3 crepes. When he saw the fruit it was rotten. Daniela (the girl making this crepe) denied this and was trying to show my husband the other side of the apple (the one that wasn't peeled). Half of the apple was peeled and cut in the middle. When I approach her, I saw a bruise on one side and a white whole coming from on the inside parts of the apple. I told her I wanted my money back. She didn't say anything just threw away the crepe and the apple and went to the back to talk to someone on the phone. When she came back, she didn't say a word UNTIL I asked her what was going on. She said she was going to give me my money back AFTER all the customers get their orders (by this time there was a line of about 15 customers).  1- We had our 3 year old son with us. Do you really think I was going to feed him that?  2- I am as important as the other customers in line. I was in line BEFORE them; therefore, I was supposed to receive my order before them or get the problem solved (again) BEFORE them.  3- This was beyond poor customer service. You should think about re train your staff. Daniela was careless and had an attitude the whole time.  4- I tipped them when I paid for the order but LEFT because it was outrageous to be asked to WAIT for Daniela to be available to reimbursed me.  5- I called the number that she gave me. NO ONE answered the phone.   I was happy at first because I THOUGHT this business was profesional and being so close to us, we were going to come often and recommend to my son's friends as well but FORGET it. We won't be coming back and will let others aware of their poor customer service and rotten fruit."}
{"text":"Honestly this place can be a Hit or Miss with the Service. The First Time I came here, I wasn't happy with the Customer Service given...The Girl behind the Counter didn't look like she wanted to be there at all. But the Second Time I came here, the Gentleman behind the Counter was Fabulous!   This Ice Cream Parlor is a little on the Small side, there aren't too many seating booths, Maybe 2 or 3...but it looked clean, and there was a steady flow of Customers Coming in. Albeit, the wait time is a slow...but, worth the wait. I'm not saying its Fabulous, or Anything...but if you have a Craving for Pineapple Dole Whip, You can get it here! Or in the Boulevard Mall...The Only Other Places I Know of that Sell Pineapple Dole Whip, are Disneyland, Florida and, of course in Hawaii! I Grew Up on this Stuff, and I am Happy that there is one Close to where I live.   The Location is in the Smith's Shopping Center, I Believe it's a Couple Stores Done from \"Bone Appetit\". Give it a shot if you never had it before, they do give you samples...I Love The Stuff! Nuff Said!"}
{"text":"Amazing Ice Cream but I have to say unfortunately the service was horrible. The girl behind counter had a horrible attitude. I think we were making her angry for doing her job. Asking for samples to try a few flavors was a huge inconvenience for her. She wasn't friendly at all and seemed miserable to be doing her job. I am very upset about this because I loVe Pineapple park. My friends and I go there often with our kids after school and after park days. If you want yummy dessert I would recommend Pineapple Park but if you want good service I would definitely skip this place. Its very unfortunate!  I would have given 5 stars if the service was better. To me service is more important than anything else. People dont go out to eat or have dessert to get bad service. So if anyone asks me about Pineapple Park I will be sure to make them aware of how rude the girl behind the counter is."}
{"text":"This is probably the most amazing ice cream type soft serve ever! I personally like the pineapple and vanilla, I have also had the berry as well. I do not get the pineapple bowl anymore because I feel like I get more out of just a cup! It is inside the mall, but you are surrounded by good food! They also let you try samples! My 5 for 10 dollar deal wouldn't let me purchase through yelp, but still worth it! I wish it wasn't 30 min away!   You should move to downtown Summerlin!"}
{"text":"This place is so yummy love the dole whip just like Disneyland since I haven't been to Hawaii."}
{"text":"Stopped by on our way out of Vegas since my girlfriend wanted dessert. We found this great spot for our sweet tooth cravings from dole whip, to boba tea, to even stuffed crépes...all of which I highly recommend! All of the staff were very friendly and attentive. (Thank you Hailey for your hospitality) Awesome location to hang out with friends and/or family. I will definately be back the next time I'm in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"So creamy & yummy, and a single serving is 90 calories! There used to be a couple places in town, where you could get this tasty treat, one being Boulder City, and the other in a water park in Henderson, Cowabunga. (Otherwise, you could get this at Disneyland or on the island of Oahu in the Waikiki area.) Not anymore! Now you have another reason to come to the Boulevard Mall.   We got free samples during opening weekend, and met the owner, who was really nice. There were a couple different flavors that I really liked, pineapple (the original), orange, and vanilla. The lady at checkout is also really nice, too. Later, I found this place on Groupon.com and we've been here a couple times now. This place also has a loyalty stamp card, so make sure you get one for yourself.  I love ice cream and other frozen delicious treats like yogurt or custard (this is my chocolate). I still continue to have it in the winter time. It's my thing. I love, love, love the stuff. Everyone's got that one thing, and this is mine, the one category, anyway. I figure I don't drink much these days, I eat well most days of the week, I workout, I practice moderation, so I can enjoy a frozen treat now and then. Anyway, I like getting two flavors here. The vanilla is really good, so it's usually my 2nd choice. And I really can't decide which one I like the most, it's between pineapple and orange.    Lastly, if you get the souvenir cup, when you return, you get refills at half price- that's a steal!"}
{"text":"Love this icecream place! They have unique flavors, and they serve root beer also ;) come here to spend time with your kids by playing board games (you can borrow them for free)"}
{"text":"Got the Dole Pineapple and Strawberry swirled together..... Tart and sweet! Yum yum! Best part? It's lactose/dairy free!! If you care, it's also gluten free, fat and cholesterol free and Vegan!   Definitely worth it!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed!  Traveled from the strip, arrived at 10:50pm to find that it was closed.  It was advertised to be open til midnight."}
{"text":"First time and definitely coming back. The cashier is really helpful. It's not too sweet and very refreshing."}
{"text":"A little pricey but the product is worth it.  I have 3 children and normally i can't get them to agree on anything.  But this place has so many options everyone is happy here.  We live in mountains edge so luckily we aren't too far away to stop in any time"}
{"text":"I came once right when it opened and it was such a bad service I never came back, after a couple of years I decided to give it another try, our crepe place in rainbow is closed for construction, so we came here craving a simple berry and Nutella crape, it is literally disgusting!!! We paid 20 dlls for 2 crepes and a kid single scoop of ice cream! Terrible!! The crepe is cold, the berries are frozen from a frozen bag, the nutella is so little I can barely see it let a long taste it. Can not wait for Brew Tea Bar to be open again!!!!"}
{"text":"After coming here a ton and reading a bunch of the other reviews, I had to add my two cents. I'm a bit perplexed on the owners response to a lot of the one star reviews, but at the same time I have to say I love it and have been thoroughly entertained. She is very passionate about her restaurant.    ***First and foremost I have to say: I think the reviewers are becoming a tad sensitive. Within this yelp culture, it's almost as if these people expect the red carpet to be rolled out for them wherever they go. Their panties are in a bunch if their asses aren't kissed and their presence isn't noticed within 5 seconds upon entering an ice cream shop. It's like they expect a spotlight and applause for even deciding to enter the store. You people just need to relax. This is an ice cream shop!!! I don't care how much you're paying for dole soft serve you whiney babies need to relax. I feel people take out their aggressions on these yelp boards if their asses weren't sufficiently kissed because they're not getting proper attention elsewhere. And that's not fair. I'm not expecting A list celebrity treatment when I go to get soft serve and maybe that's why I'm not always disappointed like so many other yelpers. Get over yourselves.   Few tips:  A. The place always takes a while. No matter what time you come in. During the day? There will be an order of crepes ahead of you. At night? A family of ten.  B. Dip n dots are usually out. However they have a good vegan option that's pretty good.  C. I haven't really experienced the terrible customer service everyone else seems to speak of. Just young kids working an ice cream shop. I'm not sure what everyone expects.  D.  I can't say enough good things about their crepes. This should really be your only reason to come here. You can get soft serve anywhere and most people seem to complain about the prices. The crepes here are priced well and absolutely delicious.  E. The hole in the cup. I've experienced this. I've seen it in other reviews. Not sure why they do this but it seems to be their thing.  F. All and all, the times I've waited forever and wish they had more help to the other times I've eaten here, I have to say the place and food is pretty consistent and I'm overall a happy customer."}
{"text":"If you are denying what you had written that the girls behind the counter do not wipe down the tables, then why did you delete your response?/post! Now you are backpedaling. Obviously you are a very young and inexperienced business owner.  You take every little Recommendation or Criticism personally and ALWAYS on the defensive.  Other Yelp readers are actually amused  by your inexperience and unprofessionalism with your comments. Nobody is out to get you. We want to see nice businesses in our community. But please be professional. What happened to the customer is always right?  In response to the owner, so you are telling me that the girls behind the counter, their job is not a waitress/bus person so the tables do not get wiped down throughout the day?? Especially when you are serving an extra sticky product??  DOES THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT KNOW ABOUT THIS? Lack of cleanliness! Ewwww"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get dole whip. In vegas, there aren't many places to get my favorite Disneyland treat... I live 30 minutes away from pineapple park but I'm glad to make the drive out here. I also LOVE LOVE LOVE how they have different dole whip sundaes. I haven't ever seen that at any place that sells dole whip, it's usually just the pineapple juice wth dole whip or dole whip soft serve. This place is so unique and delicious. However, if you don't love dole whip, you can pick from crepes, dippin dots or even boba! There's something for everyone! 10/10 recommend to anyone who loves the classic Disneyland dole whip. To top it off, the employees are so friendly and welcoming! (You don't get that everywhere you go)."}
{"text":"Tried to use the restaurant.com certificate that was purchased 3 days ago, only to learn they no longer honor the certificates.  Needless to say, I did not order or eat any of their food.  I would recommend not eating there since they do not honor their commitments to their customers."}
{"text":"Completely satisfied my craving. The owner was there I believe and he made my dole whip float! Service was really fast and the cashier was super friendly. So excited that dole whip came to Vegas!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by here to see what this new shop was all about in Southern Highlands.  We tried the Dole Pineapple whip and it was sooooo delicious and refreshing.  You would never know that it was not a diary product and that the small cup only had 45 calories.  It's all natural and because it does not have any diary or eggs, it's actually vegan.  We'll be going back to try other things!"}
{"text":"Delilah! So good and friendly staff. This is our go to for an after dinner treat! Excited to try more things from hers"}
{"text":"Came here for their dole whip and most definitely will come back for more. Reminds me of back at home in hawaii"}
{"text":"Refreshing, delicious and satisfying!! I was craving a fruity cool treat, and I recalled this place had just opened. I ordered the Dole Whip pineapple soft serve on a waffle cone. Good size for $4.95. I was full when I was done eating it. I will be back & give their crepes a try. They looked like they would be delicious."}
{"text":"So yummy! This place was completely out of my way but so good it was worth it.  I never come to this mall but I will be back for the pineapple dole whip. I got the souvenir cup. The staff was very nice and helpful they even brought me a trail size when I said I'd never had it before. I got the pineapple float, but would probably not get the juice added next time I come."}
{"text":"Heard about this place and passed it numerous times and finally I made it in.   Davey was awesome, he helped me decide which flavor to get and I stuck with Pineapple.  Omg! The sample alone gave me my fix.  I was about to leave and be like \"thank you, that's all I needed\" BUT.... who passes a $2.75 kid cup when the sample was heaven?   Not me!  I wanted it to go, so he said he'd put the amount of a kid cup into the next size up that way he can cover it.  When he gave it to me, he said he saran wrapped it over a slurpee cover because they ran out of actual covers. Total fine with me I thought that was awesome customer service.  Work with what you got.  It was definitely  worth every penny!  Thanks Davey!!   I'll be back and I wanna try Strawberry next."}
{"text":"Interacting with Pineapple Park both on their website chat and via phone were both easy and convenient.  Sadly, they are no longer opening a site at Fashion Show Mall in February 2015, but another store off the strip will be.  And there is another site on the strip that is currently being built and is 90 days out from opening.  Unfortunately, I won't be in the area then..."}
{"text":"I love this place the new look is awesome! Oh and the crepes are good too try it! When I first found this place it was under different ownership and the look had changed over time and was not very pleasant but looks like they now have new ownership who understands how to take care of a business now I am coming back again love the new look!"}
{"text":"Dole pineapple whip anytime you want.... need I say more?! The best on a hot day. The owner is very nice and helpful. A little pricey but worth it!"}
{"text":"In Southern Highlands we have limited options, this place is great for a quick sweet fix. I live thrifty ice cream. Crepes are okay, nothing to get rave about. I would give this place 4-5 stars, if they had more employees working. Every single time my family go's in it's a 10-15 wait easy. Always one person working, and she is always running around very little time to greet customers. Help your employees out people!!!!"}
{"text":"So this is our second time here. We were super excited the first time & the way we were treated by the owners were awesome. This time around was different...   So we got the souvenir pineapple cup the first time cause the owner said that we get a discount with the refill. We brought it back and the cashier who was \"taking care\" of us (more like bothered by us) seemed annoyed.. I think her name was Amber, that's what the guy called her. I ordered the pineapple strawberry mix & she brought me just the pineapple but when I informed her that it was wrong, she had this annoyed look on her face. & when I told her that I needed spoon, she annoyingly pointed at the container with just one spoon. & I told her I just picked up that spoon from the ground and put it there (thinking it was trash) and she pointed at the other side (with an attitude) & told me there's more there (?!?) Like really?.. I understand this is not fine dining or anything like that but with the way we were treated tonight, no matter how good your product is, I'm not willing to give you business if we're not treated with hospitality.. thought this was for family, local, neighborhood store..   Anyways, ice cream is good though. But hey, it's so disappointing about the customer service we received :( it really makes me sad cause we LOVED this place.."}
{"text":"The staff here is wonderful, along with the management and owners. Great place to go for vegan options, and the crepes are amazing. There is a wide selection of options. Pineapple Park is one of my favorite dessert places in Las Vegas and I highly recommend it. They have crepes, boba, Dip N' Dots, Dole Whip, and so much more. I would highly recommend trying it!!"}
{"text":"I like eating dessert here. Prices a little high.   Food: good nuttel banana crape, good Dole whip with vanilla ice cream. Niece has banana foster crape, that was good too.   Service:ok Inside: clean so so, great lighting, 3 short  table tops, tall counter top seating is good.  Parking: lots  I will be going back because this place reminds me of home (Hawaii)"}
{"text":"First off, this place is completely over priced!! We stopped in because it's new and we saw that they were serving Dippin Dots. I guess their main item is the Dole Whip which I've only ever seen at Disney, but that wasn't the focus for us. Dippin Dots are like a hidden treasure, you only come upon them once in a great while. We were so excited to see them locally until we went in. They're sort of tucked away in a small freezer in the corner and the prices aren't displayed on the overhead price board. My husband and I ordered 1 large (12 oz) cup to split. The total...$11.00!!! That's highway robbery in my opinion! Granted, I know they may have a local monopoly on them but don't rob your customers! We might be back on occasion but I hate going somewhere where the company tries to offset their overhead by putting it on the customer. My suggestion..slim down your menu, get rid of the cutesy cups and spoons and try to adjust staff on slower times. Not too many businesses make it in your location, be smart to keep customers coming back!"}
{"text":"The best soft serve in town!!!! Orange and vanilla in a waffle is the way to go.  Till we meet again PINEAPPLE PARK!!!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. The help was amazing.   I was really impressed by the taste, size of the servings for such little price.   Great place to go for some delicious pineapple whip.  Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Destiny is the best employee ever!!! She really loves her job and is a pro at the crepes!  Props to her :)"}
{"text":"Came for the dole whip. Pretty awesome stuff it reminds me of this one ice cream thing I used to get at Costco that was like ice cream in fruit shells. Never had dole whip before but it was actually really good and did not disappoint. I would recommend the pineapple flavor and getting the big pineapple souvenir as you can bring that back for half off every time. Be aware of the groupon and that it won't work on the pineapple souvenir though. Learned the hard way but was still worth it."}
{"text":"The best pineapple dole whip in Las Vegas. Great customer service! I have been going to Pineapple Park since they have been open, and have always been impressed with the quality and customer service. You don't want to miss this place!"}
{"text":"I got the jasmine green tea with mango flavor. So refreshing! Samara suggested some flavors for my daughter & I and we LOVED it. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Okay, so I love Froyo, but how have I never heard of Dole Whip!!??  It's delicious!  I stumbled onto this place after eating next door and I'm so glad I did!  I let the cashiers know that it was my first time there and they told me what was popular.  I'm glad I was too full for a crepe so I tried the dole whip.  Delicious!  They gave me the most popular flavor which was pineapple mixed with something else.  I've tried sorbets but this was something else!  Not sweet, perfectly tart.  Only thing that I didn't like was that the person who was making the order did such an amazing job at making a spiral, that the middle of the cup was hollow.  Felt a little cheated because I thought the whole cup was dense and filled completely.  If you would like dessert and don't want something too sweet, you've gotta try the dole whip!"}
{"text":"So so glad that we opened this location in vegas!!! I love dole whips, I use to wait around for food fest to come or whenever im in disneyland I would wait in line just for this I'm glad we have this in vegas not just this location I know they're opening another location on eastern which is right by my work so I'll be there more often! Very refreshing, won't be disappointed. They also have excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"They have dippin dots and dole whip which is great but its kind of pricey and they run out of dippin dots flavors sometimes. We discovered that King Putt is a cheaper option for dippin dots."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried dole whip you are missing out ! I know there's a few other places in town you can get it but in Vegas I've only had it here. I always get it when I'm in Hawaii at the Dole plantation , to be honest it tastes better there. Maybe theirs is more authentic but I don't know maybe it's the fact that you're in Hawaii. I can't get there as fast as I can it get here so it's a good option if you love Dole whip and live in Vegas. Located inside Boulevard mall at the food court. Fast and friendly service. Dole whip lovers rejoice !"}
{"text":"Nothing bad to be said about the product, it's Dole Whip. It's deliciousness in a cup. 2 stars for the lack of service. I have visited twice so far and both times the service was non existent. I understand it's in the food court inside the mall but c'mon, service should be somewhat pleasant no matter the location. I believe each customer should be asked if it's their first time, especially if you've been studying the menu for a couple of minutes looking perplexed. And if it is, engage them and try to sell your product. Have them try what you offer. Believe me, if I had my mind set on getting a small, but if I get A+ service 99 percent of the time I always upgrade, and I think most people will agree with me on this. Unfortunately for me, both times (12/20 & 12/23) both the guy and young girl manning the register just stood there and waited for us to order, not even a casual hello or an effort to upsell for that matter."}
{"text":"Response to owners reply:  Never did I mention nor compared your business to a dollar menu. Just stating what I would pay. We were there. So was the venue was so we bought. I previously stated in my review the savings were minimal purchasing the souvenir cup. That's were we got off to a bad start. We weren't offered that. Had you mentioned at the time of the purchase and said \"hey, if you buy this you can refill at a lower price for any future purchases\", and not just once using a Yelp coupon we would have been all over it. I'm all for future savings! Thats how hot dog on a stick got me hooked on 3 souvenir cups. Your product is great and addicting. You may now be the only reason people come to that mall.   But just food for thought \"offer it to all your customers the same way\"...upsell us!  I would have bought 2 just to keep coming back if I'm in the neighborhood. But we didn't get that service nor offer. My standards are high. I'm in sales too and get suckered into buying anything from anyone trying to upsell me, sometimes I just buy for the effort someone puts into trying to convince me.   Look I'm glad the mall is renovating, it needs a major facelift and you probably are getting a great deal on rent. I wish nothing but the best for you guys and will continue to cheer on all small business in the valley. Just consider the responses you make, some sound like attacks. I know some Yelp reviews are made in bad faith and power Trips for some people, but most of the time will give actual truths of potential issues you may encounter visiting the place. Don't let your business reviews be proven right. Or responses be taken as a slamming to the consumer who in all Essence is trying to give their opinion.  ----------- Visited this place while heading over to Sears at the Boulevard Mall. Its pretty dead. The whip is great...but overpriced at $6.95 plus tax ($7.50 total ) for a Dole Whip Float. I checked in while entering the food court and noticed they had a promo..BUT... you must buy the souvenir cup in order to redeem it. The souvenir cup is  approx $12.95 plus tax (so maybe 13.99)..If you get the free refill, you only walk away with $1 in savings and a plastic pineapple or coconut shaped cup, had you paid for 2 at a regular price. I didn't see the savings. I give them props for the varieties but I don't think that will help with sales according the the reviews I'm reading. I wont be back. The mall isn't the best part of town. Good luck guys!"}
{"text":"I like their Dole whip product and this is a much better location compared to the Boulevard Mall food court. It's closer to us and their prices are fair.   I went in on Saturday and picked up a to go cup (it was polka dot green) and it was filled pretty high. (I feel bad for the gentleman who posted the pink cup with the lid. Mine looked nothing like that.)  Back to my experience: The young lady at the register was very helpful. I had a ton of questions about sizes. She was very informative and helped me get exactly what I wanted.   I brought up the Yelp offer and she was very informative and upfront about all the details. I liked that! She was very patient and very sweet.   I will come back."}
{"text":"First time trying the infamous Dole Whip and I'm hooked! The different flavors are all so delicious it's hard to choose just one! Nice to find a place that will be serving this yummy treat year round and actually in town! The establishment itself is very clean and the professionalism of the owners is as refreshing as their product. Will definitely be back to get my souvenir cup!"}
{"text":"It's summer time in Vegas, and I was looking for an ice cream shop.  Fortunately, I remember I read about this place in a magazine.  It's not far from where I live, so I went to check it out.  It's a nice little place to chill, it wasn't very busy at all when I went in the late afternoon.  I ordered the famous Dole Whip, it was very refreshing and it was pineapple overload in my mouth.  I noticed they have other stuff too, like banana split, pineapple upside down cake, pineapple boat split and shakes. Looks tasty!!    The service was okay but lacked attentiveness.   The lady at the counter was nice, she told me if I needed anything just ask. When i finished my ice cream which was 20 minutes, I still felt thirsty so I wanted to get some juice to go but no one was around for me to ask. I assumed they were in the back, so I got started looking at the different ice creams and other selections hoping someone would see me and come out.  After 10 minutes, no one came and it was quiet besides the TV, so I felt awkward and walked out."}
{"text":"Disney is too far for my fix, so I'm glad that Pineapple Park is 5 minutes from my house. My wife and I always have great service. The lines(if any) fade quickly and the Dole Whip, well... it speaks for itself."}
{"text":"If I could give less than 1 I would. I purchased a Yelp deal for a $30 certificate. I met my friend and we planned on ordering crepes and dessert since the deal was for $30. When we entered we weren't greeted by either lady working at the counter. While ordering we were told the certificate was only good for the dole whip. Yes I'd like $30 worth of soft serve...No, not really. It didn't specify that on the certificate and the young woman said the manager wanted it that way. I asked if the manager was there and she offered to call him/her on the phone. I plainly told her that was really dumb and left. While venting outside the store we passed the owner and he tracked down my friend and I and I explained that the certificate was different from what he wanted or was claiming. He also said there was an option for a lesser amount which was also not true. I called him a shitty owner for being just that and in return he called me a shitty customer which I was not since I never and will never buy anything from that vile place. It was quite hilarious how unsympathetic he was to understanding what I was saying. He was right. I was wrong. My friend even looked up the deal after and said I was completely right. I didn't even have to buy her lunch at Rise and Shine. Which is awesome, btw. All in all I will not support a business with a tool of an owner."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here on a bday weekend with a groupon I had purchased. It's a nice little place, although very busy at nights! The place was packed when we went in there.  They have many different offerings and everything looked delicious. I ended up getting a build your own crepe, and it was to die for. The server commented she had never seen anything like it lol.  I ordered strawberries, cheesecake, cookie dough, and cookie butter. I call it the California Cookie Butter Concoction. Try it the next time you visit this awesome little place! :)"}
{"text":"A nice place to visit for an afternoon dessert.  I had the pineapple upside-down treat and it was great!  The pineapple flavor was outstanding.  My favorite part was the cake at the bottom.  The staff was very nice and helpful, as I've never been there before.  I really enjoyed my visit."}
{"text":"One of the only places in Vegas that I could find Dippin Dots! Unfortunately, they almost never answer their phones and service is a bit slow, but other than that everything is delicious, especially their crepes!"}
{"text":"I normally come here for some refreshing dessert and today I ordered the pineapple float and was kinda disappointed. The pineapple was old and the presentation of the ice cream looked horrible. The girls needs to work on the swirls."}
{"text":"Our family LOVES this place. Yummy dole whip. Prices are fair. We purchased the pineapple souvenir cup and get discounted refills. :) Small mostly quiet place in S.Highlands.   Recommend: YES"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff,   HOWEVER   Way too much stuff, stick with core items. Confusing menu. No clue what to order  most of the signature dishes are soft serve.  Way too expensive, $14 for two soft serve ice creams.  Girl ran into back, but only after she made sure I paid. No clue why she ran in back. came back five minutes later with my ice cream. I honestly thought she stiffed/robbed us, and we were actually leaving.  Bananas foster ice cream was horrible, one bite and I threw it out, $7.95 down the drain. Soft serve that looked NOTHING like the image They had good looking Thrifty ice cream, that they avoided selling us. I should have gone with that tried and true.  NEVER will I return to this confusing store. Ever."}
{"text":"I absolutely love their ice cream. My last experience wasn't so well. The manger got overwhelmed with the customers and yelled at me when I corrected my order."}
{"text":"This place has the best management and customer service. You are greeted in a welcoming manner upon entering the door. I never know what to get. Everything looks so delicious and IS. The Banana Foster is delicious! Try it with pecan ice cream! I love the peach and vanilla whip! We love this place!"}
{"text":"5 stars because why not. They have the traditional Dole desserts like dole whip floats, banana splits, shakes, and even Dip 'n Dots (which what I keep coming back for).  I guess the only downside about this place is how often they run out of the ever-so-popular Banana Split flavor for their Dip 'n Dots. But lucky for me, I prefer Cookies & Cream :)"}
{"text":"There's a handful of places that serve pineapple soft-serve/froyo or Dole whip. However, they're in Henderson or Boulder City.   I love pineapples and Dole Pineapple Whip Float reminds me of good times: Disneyland and Dole Plantation in Hawaii. I'd get pineapple cravings at random times and inconveniently when I'm on the opposite end of Boulder City/ Henderson. So, I'm glad there's a place that has pineapple treats within a 15-mile radius from me.  This is located inside Boulevard Mall food court. Park by Sears or Old Navy and use the entrance in between those two places and that will take you to the food court. I'm not a fan of this mall so, I seriously just went for Pineapple Park.  I was greeted by the owner's lovely wife who took my order. She told me that they've been open since August 1st and that they're opening up a location Downtown next month, Fashion Show Mall in Feb 2015 and Summerlin Mall some time in 2015. I was so amused that I ended up getting my Dole Whip Float in a souvenir cup. I was walking around all day with a pineapple in my purse. The DWF had a fresh pineapple spear with the usual pineapple soft-serve and pineapple juice.  They have other items on the menu. They have orange and raspberry soft-serve. The raspberry was nice and tart.  They gave me a stamp card. Getting the souvenir cup wasn't a bad idea because I'd get 50% off on my next DWF's, yay!"}
{"text":"Normally I really love this place, but the last two times I have been here the flavor selection has really been lacking. My daughter wanted cotton candy flavored Dippin Dots which they didn't have. She decided to settle for cotton candy Thrifty's ice cream but nope, they didn't have that either. Maybe you should adjust what your menu says.   We finally got settled with her third choice (vanilla Dippin Dots) and I tried to use a coupon from the entertainment book but was told that I couldn't use it. The coupon said buy one menu item, get one free but according to the girl working there, Dippin Dots don't count. Okayyyyyy  All these things were annoying, but the thing that pushed me over the edge and made me decide to write a review is that while my daughter and I were sitting there, the girl working there climbed over the counter to talk to her friend that walked in. Climbing over the counter with your tennis shoes? Wow. With more places selling Dole Whips, I may no longer be as excited to visit Pineapple Park."}
{"text":"I ordered the bananas foster which had the makings to be amazing.... Ended up with soup before I was even out the door with it.   A bit unorganized but maybe with time and training they will get better .. It was a great flavored soup though.."}
{"text":"I placed a very simple order (1 scoop of ice cream) on UberEATS 15 minutes before they closed. They never accepted it and waited until after the closed to decline. I have ordered from here many times and will not order again. Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Came for the ice cream. Who knows if I'll ever try their food, I'm happy enough just eating the Dole Whip. It's very addicting. I could go everyday! Our first trip to this location was late on a Saturday night, shockingly enough there was no line. I got the cup with 2 flavors, vanilla and raspberry. OMG! Heaven! A little of both flavors on the spoon for each bite is perfect. My husband got the Frozen Hot Chocolate, it was chocolatey perfection. I feel like the prices are a little high but I like it too much to really care what price I'm paying. The staff was pleasant. Store was clean No doubt, I'll be back again and again and again."}
{"text":"I had the dole whip smoothie with pina colada and medium dippin dots cotton candy. Service was friendly and helpful. Place was also clean. Products are good but a lil bit pricey. For both, I paid almost 17 bucks without the tip.  *update: I'm changing my review from 4 to 5 stars because owner reached out to me and acknowledged their error regarding my total and offered to refund the difference :)"}
{"text":"For someone who has been to Disneyland multiple times and never tried Dole Whip I'm disappointed in myself.  I recently attended Pineapple Park's grand opening weekend and was greeted by the owner himself who asked if I was familiar with Dole whip. When I told him I wasn't, he immediately presented me with a sample of the infamous pineapple flavor treat. Instantly I fell in love and ordered a dole whip float. This consisted of Dole whip (I got the pineapple strawberry swirl...a must try), pineapple juice, a large spear of fresh pineapple topped with a cherry and umbrella, and placed into a souvenir, pineapple park, pineapple shaped cup! I ate every bite of my sweet treat, pineapple spear included!  What got me hooked was how healthy it was. For someone who keeps kosher it met those needs, as well as fit into my weight watchers lifestyle...2 points plus for 6oz!!!!! Anyone who follows weight watchers this will be music to their ears.  If you haven't already tried it I suggest you make your way down to the boulevard mall and try it for yourself. The float is just one of many ways to get your fix of Dole whip :)"}
{"text":"First time customer live down the street! Young Girl, tattoos, noise ring, BAD attitude. I asked the young lady if i could have my ice cream inside my crepe she said, \" We don't do that here, you never want to but ice cream inside you warm crepe.\" My response was I usually do at the crepe places I go to. She nodded no. I had tipped her before but wish i hadn't. We ate our crepes and observed how she treated others customers had a few people in line and said, \" I just don't know why people rush me, when they can see im the only one here.\" Customer just looked at her like why are you verbalizing this??? ---RUDENESS is not the way to go. I love crepes Im just not returning again even though my crepe was good.    Update--Thank you for your response to my yelp review, Brooke I. but im a little perplexed with your response on the yelp review and the response my husband got via email privately.  How anybody could say publicly that they are sorry for the events that took place on the day of our visit and contact my husband via email, guessing they took the information from the email that was linked to the credit card receipt that my husband provided your business with, which was ONLY to be used to send a receipt of what was ordered and paid for not as a form to track, contact and harass us. Not only do i feel like my privacy has been violated but I have also been a victim of harassment,  threaten with a lawsuit and told we were no longer able to step foot in your business or would be arrested for trespassing. This is extremely concerning and unethical as yelp is a great way to help businesses better connect with customers. We would love to speak to the owner of this establishment and are hoping that the person who contacted us privately is not the same person who replied to our review publicly."}
{"text":"Dole whip! So I'm a little bit obsessed and am guilty of traveling to disneyland to get some in the park. Thus, when I found out about this place I was hooked. I think it tastes exactly like the one you get in the park, but without dealing with all the traffic. I love that the location has different flavors. I haven't tried them, but I plan to in the near future. They also are pretty generous with portions. I was full with just the small size. I guess I'll have to build up some tolerance to this tasty delight."}
{"text":"Was not happy with the service we received here.. This place is super convenient because it's just down the street from where we live.. We've been here twice.. The first time the girl who served us was very helpful and nice.. This last time we came here we came at 930pm. My husband asked if he could get a crepe and the girl who was working said no we don't serve crepes thirty minutes before we close..Then my husband apologized and asked for the bananas foster ice cream which then the server rolled her eyes and said fine but I'll still have to wash the pan. So yet again my husband changed his order. First and foremost I don't care if you work the night shift and you want to go home if your open your open and you should still have better customer service then that and second if your not gonna serve half your menu before you close you might want to have a sign that says that. Next time we'll just drive a couple more minutes and get better service.."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!! I feel in love with dole whip in Hawaii years ago and before Pineapple parked opened at the Blvd mall the only place I could get it was at Disneyland. I'm soo happy its literally down the street from me now... Super dangerous lol"}
{"text":"Hella unorganized. I totally understand you just opened last week but with a rush that I experienced I would think there would be some organization.  My banana' foster sundae was a total fail. More soup then ice cream."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and been underwhelmed both times. The first time, they charged my debit card 4 times for the same purchase. Tonight, the second time, the service was painfully slow. There was one guy trying to take and make the orders. Finally, when the line was 11 people deep, another person finally came out to help take orders.  The Dole whip was tasty, but my crepe was meh. There was hardly any filling, and the filling that was in there was so cold it made the entire crepe ice cold by the second bite. Plus, this place is a poor value for the money. We ordered 2 crepes, a small Dole whip, and a bottled water and it was $21! We won't be back."}
{"text":"Looks like there is hope for the Boulevard Mall after all. I have been wanting to try a dole whip forever, I thought I would have to wait till my next trip to Disneyland. It was just as delicious as I imagined :) I got to talk to the owner, he was super friendly and helpful. He talked me into the souvenir cup, so I can always get half off refills! Totes worth it. Plus he said there are plans for more locations!!!"}
{"text":"Love the new management that has taken over the place, customer service is OUTSTANDING! All the new things that they are adding to the menu are great as well, definitely worth the drive across town for!"}
{"text":"The staff here has been consistently friendly. The ice cream is absolutely delicious. It's a very welcoming environment. Fun place to get a sweet treat for kids the  or the entire family."}
{"text":"Finally a place that can cater to my pineapple needs. This place really made me feel like I was at the Dole Plantation in Hawaii. The dole whip was awesome and the Pineapple Boat Banana Split was amazing.. The workers were really friendly and the place wasn't that busy. Wish they had li hing mui tho.. other than that, price was reasonable and I can see this place getting really busy during the hot season.."}
{"text":"Great dessert, and great service. Shout out to Sam and Mae, cool girls with awesome service skills and personalities."}
{"text":"Delicious. My whole family loved it. You don't need to go to Disney Land to enjoy a Dole Whip in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Thanks to Ed V. I have been craving a pineapple dole whip for months. Last Saturday presented a prime opportunity since my daughter and I had decided to check out IKEA.   Pineapple Park is a little out of the way for me since I live in the NW but well worth the trip. My dole whip tasted as delicious as I thought it would. From the pictures, it looks creamy but it is more like an Icee. Super refreshing and large portions even for a kids cup so good bang for your buck! With our hot summers this is a fun way to take a break and cool off while enjoying this fun treat.  Service was friendly and quick. The young lady who helped us is off to college soon and she seemed to know quite a few of the regulars. I am sure she will be missed as she really knows her job and has a great attitude.   I plan to return to this cute little place before the summer ends and indulge my taste buds again!"}
{"text":"While I don't have any problem with this place, I've never said, \"let's go to PP\" over another place, hence the reason it's not 4 stars in my book.   Overall, this place has various specials, punch cards, groupons and check in offers to keep their items reasonably priced.   In addition to pineapple, they offer mango and raspberry whip as well and their sundaes are topped with fruit flavored syrups, such as lime or strawberry.  Best item to get to wow somebody in the sundae in a pineapple boat. You'll get to sample a bit of everything but it is incredibly messy to eat.   Overall this place is good but messy and located in a ghetto mall's food court."}
{"text":"Decent product. Same as Disneyland. Very creative menu. Service was too slow, as well.   Pricing is way too high. I would personally appreciate a kids menu. Spending $5.00 on an ice cream like treat for a kid is pretty steep. Same for an adult."}
{"text":"I can't believe the negativity this store has created for themselves. I wanted to leave a review just stating that the dole whip wasn't great and that was flagged because clearly the owner has a vendetta against anyone that doesn't appreciate her business. So, to go into detail: The dole whip had a sweet fake pineapple taste that I just don't enjoy. Service was slow and prices are high. For around $5 I get a sugary icy thing that is hollow in the middle and leaves me unhappy.  Not worth it!"}
{"text":"Whipped pineapple was amazing. But they also had a nice selection of ice cream and toppings. My kids loved it the staff was friendly and it was very clean I'll be returning soon"}
{"text":"Went there last Friday night to see what all the fuss is about.  Had a dole whip (pineapple) and AAAAHHHHMIGOSH it is delish and amazing. I'm already craving it again!  I want to try the other flavors, too."}
{"text":"Whip it whip it good.  DOLE WHIP here was smooth, creamy and refreshing.  Now If you really feel daring, and in the mood, try the whip on two, I mean for two, aka Bosai is a Whole Pineapple stuffed with Dole whip.  The banana fosters I had was also delicious.  Pineapple Park has many unique concoctions to choose from, but two was enough for this trip.        The staff here are super friendly super helpful and best of all, they smiled and laughed the whole time.   This place hit the spot...especially on a hot day.    I will return to play in this park."}
{"text":"I found this little gem in my community recently. My daughter absolutely loves visiting! They have a cool chalkboard for the kids to draw on and a variety of board games if you want to stay and hang out. My daughter likes to try something different each time. She has tried the chocolate/vanilla swirl, the frozen hot chocolate and the fantastic banana split. We always enjoy stoping by. The staff is also very attentive and interactive with adults and the children. I recommend this establishment. You"}
{"text":"Yummy!!!!! Vegan and Dairy free ;) A great treat ;) Took some friends for a second time. They really enjoyed it but the crepes were a little bland they said."}
{"text":"The dole products are delicious but be assured you're never going to get with your promised. If you get a cup the entire center is empty and if you get the \"special\" pineapple with 50% cost on refills... BEWARE!!!! There are many loopholes and it's not even filled close to three quarters of the way full... with a big hole in the middle... again! Not worth the money. Either get reasonable prices or serve what you promise!!!! When you come for ice cream it should be a treat, you should not have to feel robbed!"}
{"text":"Came here last night for the first time!!!!  I had the dole whip float!!!!! Sooooo amazing! I've told everyone about it!!! I will for sure be back. And the girls working were super nice, helpful, and quick with orders."}
{"text":"Although we were pretty surprised that this place was located in a mall (yuck)... BUT: So happy to find Dole whip on the 9th Hawaiian island!!!   I love the original pineapple Dole whip, and had pretty much resigned myself to either waiting until I was actually out in Hawaii again or at Disneyland. So finding it locally was a huge treat.   The service was excellent and quick, we ordered 2 traditional Dole whips and 2 pineapple Dole whip floats. Yelp actually let's you buy a great discount coupon ($10 for $5), which was nice because it's actually a bit pricey. Sucks that we had to sit and eat it in a crappy little mall food court, but we enjoyed it nonetheless. Yum."}
{"text":"Review for afternoon of 5/16/2016  We got really excited to find Dole Whip on the south side of Vegas, however very disappointed in both the service and the amount of dessert for the price. Should have read the reviews before coming here. Wow.   Walked in to an empty shop blasting music and it took the guy a while to come out of the back room. Very rude, \"whatever\" attitude as we ordered. Gotta love the techie iPad used for payment at the counter, so tacky to make someone feel obligated to give a tip before they've even signed or been served. Anyway, gave the guy a 10% tip. He filled up two cups of dole whip and plunked it down on the counter and walked away into the back of the shop.   Where the F are your manners/customer service, let alone your spoons????   Not sure if these type of people re owners or employees at these types of franchises, but regardless, the service here is unacceptable. I really hope the guy serving at the counter this afternoon in the San Diego t-shirt was not the owner, that poor service would be embarrassing, but it would make sense why this place only has about two stars. And for $5 a small cup, why the hell is it only 50% full? Both our dole whips had huge holes in the center where whip should be.   One gets friendlier service and more for their money down the road at Poppy's Frozen Yogurt...and yes: they serve a very nice pineapple frozen yogurt as well. Won't be back to Pineapple Park again and will not recommend. Thanks, no thanks."}
{"text":"This establishment is amazing. There are so many different options of ice cream including DIPPIN DOTS!! The customer service was amazing and all the samples we tried were delicious. I just found my new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"An apple cart is he making experience of fresh juices and pineapples along with thrifty ice cream awesome great way to start today very refreshing crapes are very delicious made fresh takes 5 to 7 minutes to have your crapes made for your bed while I file also waffles are available happy yelping!"}
{"text":"the employees always take care of the customers! The store is very cute and a spot that young kids would probably like to hang out at. Their drinks are delicious and I will definitely keep coming back because of how close they are to my house! My only suggestion is to start a punch card/rewards system so I can start racking up points LOL"}
{"text":"We love, love, love the strawberry dole whip!! Plus my five year old is obsessed with cotton candy ice cream, which is surprisingly hard to find in this area. So I know right where to go to celebrate my little girl! The store is always clean and bright and typically the employees are kind. We've had a couple less than awesome employee experiences, but let's be honest, that happens everywhere. In general, we love it here!"}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday afternoon, just before the crowd, this place does get pretty packed at times. The staff was friendly and the athmosphere was great. There was a lot of desserts to choose from. They serve crepes, waffles, dole whips,  and thriftys ice cream. There are many flavors to choose from!  I ordered the classic pineapple dole whip float. I'm a big fan of pineapple flavor anything but this was just a sugar overload. This is pineapple dole whip submerged in concentrated pineapple juice, topped off with a pineapple chunk kebab. This was way too many pineapple for me it was way too sweet! I was unable to finish the desert. I will try another item the next time I come in here, if.   This location is also next to a subway and China a gogo if you are craving some real good before desert!"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and I love it! Sierra and Jade are the nicest people ever and they deserve nothing but praise. I love the seasonal dole whip favors, so please bring back banana and don't take away my pumpkin!    I recommend coming in and getting your dole whip fix!"}
{"text":"the staff is super friendly! Someone gave us a sample of the passion tea and it was amazing and the perfect refreshing drink for summer. Will definitely be making more trips here."}
{"text":"I don't know where the bad reviews came from, but I've honestly had nothing but positive experiences at Pineapple Park!  The service has always been super friendly and accommodating when letting us try different soft serve or ice cream flavors. The place is pretty clean, and I think the prices are totally reasonable for ice cream.  Their menu is pretty extensive (and a lil bit random). In addition to their signature pineapple dole whip, and different flavors, they also have Thrifty's ice cream, Dip 'n' Dots, crepes and spin-off desserts with their signature pineapple dole whip.  I've gotten Thifty's here, which is always good, but what keeps me coming back is the pineapple dole whip. I've tried their pineapple, vanilla, and mango flavors, and pineapple is definitely the best. It's the perfect balance of sweet and tart. It goes awesome with the vanilla, which is mildly sweet, but boring on its own. My least favorite is the mango. Although it taste like real mango, it has a chalky note in the beginning that I'm not fond of.  Overall, I definitely recommend this place! It's a definite must stop during Vegas Summers ~   Side note: I know a lot of people complain that their swirls are hollow. But I don't think it's fair to say they're being \"cheated,\" since the ice cream swirl becomes twice as high as the cup. They do it so it looks cute. Just appreciate it. Sincerely, an avid appreciator of cuteness"}
{"text":"I was brought here by a friend who insisted that I needed to try Dole Whip .... OMG this was a life changing experience! Dole Whip is my new most favorite thing! I had to try the pineapple Dole Whip Float- so they take pineapple Dole Whip and put it in a cup and then pour chilled pineapple juice in the cup and top it off with a fresh pineapple spear and a lil umbrella!   This is probably my new favorite dessert place! You have to try it!"}
{"text":"So I know my past review was a little rough, but my second and definitely short visit was able to calm my senses. This company really strives to make sure that their customer satisfaction is truly guaranteed. The owner, Brooke, is super nice and addressed my concerns in such a kind manner. I happened to have time to stop by today for some pineapple whip and she wasn't there but I thought I would give it a try anyway. The guy ended up being another owner, her husband, and he was very friendly and knew about my situation because she spoke with him about it! They definitely didn't treat me differently because of my bad review, but they just understood where I was coming from. It seemed to have been an error with Groupon's company so I'm currently trying to get that fixed at the moment! For now, he offered me some whip and I was such a happy happy camper. Once again, texture was perfect and flavor was on point! Their menu was different than the first time I came and it was written on a chalk board! Really cute! He said they're adding more things to the menu and spicy-ing the place up a bit so I'm looking forward to the new changes. They definitely have an awesome lil shop and what I've had so far is great. I can't wait to keep coming back and trying new things. Just wish they were closer to home! Truly my new go-to dessert stop. If you're in the area, you gotta try it."}
{"text":"Definitely a great dessert stop! They've got everything your sweet little heart could imagine: dippin dots (like where can you find those at now a days), different flavored Dole soft serve (my favorite is the original pineapple), crepes, other fun desserts, and ice cream. It's such a treat! Good thing I live far from here because it'd be too addicting if I even lived close by. I recommend getting something different every time you come by, it makes it so you have to come back. The service was very friendly and if I had kids I would take them here for some praise if they got good grades or something like that, lol. Yummmmm."}
{"text":"I'm not to sure where all the terrible reviews stem from, it's almost as if everyone else went to a different place than I did.   My experience was a good one. We were welcomed by a very pleasant smile and when we mentioned it was our first time in, we were given a quick run down of the menu. We already knew we wanted the dole pineapple whip though, which by the way comes in several flavors. My daughter and I had the pineapple flavor and my husband had the mango flavor, both were very good. You also have the option to sprinkle toppings on your whip, so I went with li hing mui powder. Yum!   We sat on cute little couches and ate our tasty treats and enjoyed the sunlight that came in the huge windows. All in all, we enjoyed our visit and if we find ourself in the area again, we would definitely return."}
