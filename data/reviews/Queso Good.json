{"text":"The truck came to my work today and it was a bad experience. As a vegetarian, it can be a gamble if I order anything from off a grill. I usually ask if there is a way to clean off a small section before my food is cooked. Most kitchens are very nice and have no issue. The woman today was rude and said that this could not be done. I would think after getting paid so much from a corporation to cater to it's employees, and not wanting to make a customer sick, that she would have taken the time to make sure my food was prepared with no danger of contamination.  Other co-workers also commented that she was rude. Most thought the food was good, but as I said, it was not just me who had a bad experience with the woman who took our orders."}
{"text":"This food truck has great food!! And the price is perfect for what they serve....a must have whenever you see them!!"}
{"text":"Waited in line for 30-45 mins. When I order, there was not any fries or asada left. So, I get the reg nachos. The cheese was cold. It would have been nice to know that y'all ran out of food. Would have saved me some time. The couple behind waited just as long and they walked away without ordering food. Next time let your customers know when y'all run out of food."}
{"text":"Queso Good is my favorite food truck. I visit them every Friday night at Gilbert Food Truck Court in downtown Gilbert. The pulled pork quesadilla and Nacho Mamma are life changing. I highly recommend Queso Good to everyone :)  Enjoyed Seeing Queso Good all over the streets of Phx"}
{"text":"I thought I knew good quesadillas until I had Queso Good. Super good Carne Asada quesadillas. Wasn't expecting that from a food truck."}
{"text":"I do not recommend this food truck!  Ordered the Argentine Quesadilla.  first took about 30 minutes to get my order.  When I got back to my desk I realized that some ingredients were missing.  Was supposed to have moz cheese, grilled steak, chimichurri, grilled red onions, field greens and potatoes.  Well, no chimuchurri or potatoes to be found and what was on the quesadilla was minuscule.  The outer 2 inches of the quesadiilla was nothing but flour tortilla.  And by the way when was leaf lettuce considered field greens?  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I've had food from here twice and I'm in love. Once at Food truck Friday in Chandler & once at Chase field. I got the carne asada tacos both times. Steak, field greens, cheese, pico de gallo... Can't get better than that.. Comes with a side of chips and green salsa. The chips are nice and thick. The chia limeade is insanely good. My wife can't get over the chicken fajita tacos. My sister in law loves the quesadillas."}
{"text":".    . Best quesadilla I've ever had besides my fiance's and the service spot on We will definitely be back to this food truck"}
{"text":"Best green chile tacos ever.  Limeade in a Mason Jar made it perfect.  Good service & good salsa."}
{"text":"Ridiculous wait time for food at the Fiesta Bowl pregame. It took over 45 minutes to get food after paying. Order takers did not tell anyone they were so backed up. Food was fine once we got it, but not worth wasting that much of the pregame."}
{"text":"Save your money!!! Rude service and $8.50 for a tortilla with cheese and a little meat!!! PLUS, stomach pains an hour later lasting through out the night. First and worst experience!!! Wanted to love the Queen Creek festival, left my family with food poising and out $60!!!"}
{"text":"The truck scheduled for our regular office lunch stop had to cancel, and Queso Good stepped up at the last minute to fill in.  Great menu choices and a very large portion, I'm going to get a second lunch out of that monster quesadilla.  Lupita was friendly and very helpful in recommending just what to order, and Norma cooked up some darn tasty eats!  Carne was just a touch overcooked IMO, but the composition and cook on the quesadilla was just right.  Both Red and Green salsas were on point!  Any truck aficionado knows to get to the truck early, I beat the lunch rush and got my food in about 5 minutes flat, which is awesome. We are definitely going to ask for this truck to come back again!"}
{"text":"Got the green chili quesadilla, perfect heat with crispy tortilla, cool sour cream & thick homemade chips on the side"}
{"text":"Unfortunately for the reviewers below, who needs allot food quickly, she should have gone to Jack in a Box!   You should do a \"self review\" and get off the computers!  Good food isnt fast, and doesnt need allot of cheese or salt!   Queso Good is Good Fresh food! If your not a cheese horder or amped out on your sodium intake and like fresh food, I highly recommend trying their food.  The staff is friendly, The Trucks are clean and look great, the food is authentic, the drinks are good and creative.....  If your looking for a 5 minute meal go to Taco Bell...  Queso Good is great food and worth it!"}
{"text":"Queso mas o menos. The portion size was large but it was a basic quesadilla. The meat wasn't great quality and the chips were store bought. Won't be going back"}
{"text":"I had the Pork-a-Dilla and it was fantastic! Was actually shocked by how large the quesadillas are AND they give you a side of home made chips. Everything tasted great and didn't have to wait too long."}
{"text":"They catered a wedding that I coordinated last November. The food was amazing and plentiful, however they seemed to have a hard time dealing with the number of guests ordering food. It took almost twice as long as typical to get dinner served to all of the guests. Staff was great about ensuring everyone had something to eat."}
{"text":"I've only had it once, nachos and bean and cheese quesadilla. I found both great and filling. Nachos were just the regular nachos with regular fixings but I love those types of nachos. The quesadilla was incredibly good with good salsa. Was pretty fast service too with long line."}
{"text":"Best quesadilla I've had in years. The ingredients are delicious and the portion is huge. The killa dilla is only $8.50."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty food and a lot of it for the price. One quesadilla can feed two people, and I liked both the red and the green salsas. The one thing I didn't care for was the guacamole - it tasted store boughten."}
{"text":"This food truck came to my office complex last week! I ordered the Tora something or other and it was pretty darn good! I wish it came with more than 6 chips on the side but that is my only complaint! I hope the Property Management brings this truck back again!"}
{"text":"We tried this truck last night at the street food cinema and thought it was great! The wife and I shared a Toro Verde quesadilla and loved it. Shredded beef with cheddar jack and some pobalno peppers for a nice kick of heat - we honestly didn't even need the salsa. Portion was large and price was right. We will definitely hit this truck next time we see em!"}
{"text":"I ordered the toro verde.  It was ok it had a good amount of cheese,beans and shredded beef. There really weren't any other flavors on it there was a small amount of guacamole.  The guacamole was flavorless and looked like the cheap store bought kind.  I didn't see any of the other ingredients listed on the menu.  It was ok but bland.  I think in the future I will stick with the regular fair type foods when hitting up the food trucks.  Kettle Korn, fry bread, cotton candy the things that are hard to screw up."}
{"text":"I was introduced to Queso Good through work. I had the Nacho Mama and it was pretty good; no complaints. Portions were more than enough. Nothing to brag about or crave over. From what I heard from my co-workers, the quesadillas are delicious."}
{"text":"This review is in regards to their service at Shutterfly for employees.. I ordered the Argentine steak quesadilla ($8.50), it has mozzarella cheese, lettuce, tomato, steak and potatoes. The skin was perfectly grilled and crispy.. the insides were beautifully cooked and really tasty.   The man taking the orders was extremely friendly and was able to describe menu items (says he came up with every item himself). He said that every quesadilla could be made into a burrito and that they can put all sauce on the sides or inside the item, depending on what you wanted. Nice portions for what you pay for, can't wait to see them come by work again!"}
{"text":"Had the supreme nachos and a cheese quesadilla for the kids.  The supreme nachos were nothing special.  They were the typical store bought round tortilla chips, with standard nacho cheese sauce, very skinny and overdone pieces of carne asada, and other garnishments.  By the time the top layer was off, the chips were saturated in generic cheese sauce and soggy.  The cheese quesadilla was your standard quesadilla.  I don't know what I was expecting, but these are things we could have ordered at any snack bar.  They were good, just not the quality you would expect from this food truck craze."}
{"text":"This is one my my other favorite food trucks, the sister truck of Burgers Amore. Queso Good is sooooo good. Who doesn't love a cheese themed truck? Quesadillas, tacos and cheese topped fries and other assorted items,etc. Prices are very reasonable here and the folks who run it are cool."}
{"text":"Had their flamingos. They are not very good. The food was bland and the cheese did not seem like it was anything other than processed junk. Their Sriracha sour cream is also a horrible idea.  The lady at the front seemed bored and disinterested in taking orders and I think the quality of her work demonstrated the quality of their food.  Edit: Moar liek Queso Bad amirite"}
{"text":"Disappointed with tonight's service- we waited for almost 5 minutes for the lady to come outside the truck and take our order- she was busy on her phone.   I won't let one bad experience keep me from coming back to my BLT dilla! So fluffy with tortilla cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"There was a food truck event outside our office building today so a few of us thought we would check it out.  Out of the 3 trucks this one had what looked to be the quickest turnout of food. As it was crowded, and we were on a tight schedule we went with it. Big mistake!  2 of us ordered the Argentine quesadilla (steak, potato, spinach, grilled onion and chimichurri sauce). Neither of us received potato, the grilled onion was almost non-existent, there was no chimichurri sauce on mine, and my spinach turned out to be hot wilted lettuce - not to mention a random disgusting tomato that was not in the description. Plus they must have buttered the tortilla (which is so not needed) and it turned into a big greasy mess.  The steak had no flavor, there was very little cheese, and the whole thing took up almost my entire lunch hour just to get it and get back upstairs.  The salsa they had set out in little containers tasted exactly like the Macayo's jarred salsa I have in my fridge.  They had one person working the grill and one person taking orders. This is ineffient and created such a backup people were complaining.  Not only that, my order came out before about 10 other people who ordered before me and that started the group talking.  I am truly disappointed.  It was an absolute waste of $8.50 and 45 minutes."}
{"text":"Very good food and a lot of it for the price. This will forever be something I hunt for when I'm in Phoenix. The pork and the steak are both amazing options, and the wait is par for the course for food trucks."}
{"text":"Totally disappointed in the quality of their nachos. Their freshly made tortilla chips and salsa make this truck a 4 to 5 star establishment. The chips they serve as nachos are anything but fresh and homemade. They're cheap round chips that you can get from the dollar store. And within minutes they don't even resemble chips, as they turn into mush. Especially when they're slathered with gooey processed cheese sauce. Step up your nacho game and use the chips you actually make; THEN they'd be worth the $8.50!!"}
{"text":"We went to the Chicago Cubs, Sloan Park Spring Train game and \"Queso Good\" food truck was there.  Oh my what great food.  The first day we had the ball park food and it was bad.  The next day Queso Good was there and we ordered \"Pulled Pork Carnitas Tacos\".  They were so good we wanted more.  All we hoped was that they would be back for the next game we were going to and they were.  This time we ordered the \"Carne Asada Tacos\"  Again we couldn't say enough good things about the tacos.  We had one last game before we headed home to California and they were there.  We ordered the \"Carne Asada  Dilla Quesadila\" and again they were great.  We were so sorry we were going home because we could have eaten lunch from their food truck everyday.  Barbara you were so  wonderful  and friendly.  We hope you will be there next year when we come."}
{"text":"The quesadillas are good but the nachos weren't great. Store bought chips and guacamole in the nachos. The cheese tasted good and so did the Carne Asada. The portion sizes are enough for 2 so bring an appetite."}
{"text":"I only have the AZ Taco Festival to go off of so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt, but I wasn't impressed. Not awful, but not great either. Very bland in presentation and the salsa is the only thing that had any flavor."}
{"text":"Tried Queso Good for the first time at the Gilbert Food Truck event on Fridays. SO SO SO good!! Had the carnitas quesadilla and a huge mason jar of fresh cantaloupe juice. The quesadilla was flavorful and delicious. Nice and cheesy and messy. The juice was unbelievable. I bought another jar to take home and put vodka in...Don't judge me."}
{"text":"Probably some of the best street tacos I've ever had! You definitely get your money's worth! SOOOO GOOD!"}
{"text":"Today I had the pleasure of trying the California BLT I loved it. The crispness was perfect. I would get it again. My friends had the Carne Asada tacos they really enjoyed them. The food was fresh and the salsa is a must try. The women running the truck was really nice and had a great additude."}
{"text":"Queso Good is more like queso meh. I've had food from them twice now and for Mexican food it is surprising bland. This most recent time I had tacos for $6.50 so the price point for a food truck seems pretty good. There was one person cooking in the truck and one person taking orders. For a food truck with cheese in their name, the tacos I received had very little cheese on them. Also, I noticed another customer who ordered before me walking away from the truck with a large size bowl of nachos which appeared to have \"cheese product\" on the chips instead of real cheese. Seriously?"}
{"text":"We visited the truck today at the Mesa cycle festival. They had great quesadillas and HUGE nachos! The chia limeade was also delicious."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying the queso truck and it was better then I ever expected. We found them on Instagram and tried it out when they were near our home. We had 5 ppl with us and each of our orders were delicious. The warm churro chips dessert is now one of my favorite things and their fresca strawberry agua in mason jars was so good. The food was made quickly and the lady running the truck was very friendly. I would eat there again."}
{"text":"Arriving from snowing NY, the 90F weather in Tempe was so nice and so hard at the same time.  We were so happy to find three food trucks.  After some consideration, we decided to get quesadilla (we are in Arizona, the south of border food must be good!)  And they were good.  Were they fried?  They were crispy outside.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Great green chile beef! Perfect for a warm sunny day at the park! Don't forget the salsa!"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service. We had Burgers Amore and Queso Good cater our wedding and it was such a hit! Some of our favorite quesadillas are the killa dilla and hail caesar! Their catering services were outstanding and highly recommend them for any event you might have."}
{"text":"Have had much better Mexican food. The cheese is eh. Had the carne asada fries and was having trouble finding the carne asada. Filibertos has better carne asada fries."}
{"text":"Finally had the chance to try this out. I ordered the Shroomzilla and it was delicious. The lady was friendly and I didn't have to wait long either. Would  definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I ordered the nacho supreme and they were at best stadium quality nachos for $8.50 plus tax. The red salsa is good, but the carne asada was cold and pretty tough."}
{"text":"Not a fan, they were parked out front of my office and it looked good it smelled good. Taste not so good!  Cannot remember the name of the Quesadilla I had however it was described with Steak, Mozzarella with field of greens.  Well first off they cooked the quesadilla in butter (Who does that?) it had a rancid taste to it. They were very greasy. Then the field of greens was head lettuce. Sorry Queso that is no Bueno! That is just false advertising.   A co worker had one asked for no onion because she has an allergy. Well they put onion and she didn't realize until it was too late. We both threw them away. I called their office and they asked me to let the workers on the truck know. I did and got a thanks for telling us!   No I'm sorry do you want another or your money back or part of your money back nothing. Bad Queso!   They came back a few other co-workers tried them and found them to be just as greasy and unappealing. for $10.00 a pop they should have been wayyyyyyy better."}
{"text":"The bad:  This is a \"gourmet food truck\", but if you order the nachos of $8.50, you're going to get bagged, pre-made chips with canned cheese. Everybody else gets fresh house-made chips unless you order an entree that's chip based, which doesn't make much sense.   The good: The quesadillas and the tacos are worth the money though. They have a lot of flavor and some really unique combinations. As long as you stay away from the nachos, you're golden."}
{"text":"I have to say, I'm a little baffled by the one-star rating for Queso Good.  I had an excellent experience!  The gentleman who took my order was friendly and helpful, and there were so many delicious options to choose from!  I decided on the Toro Verde because I'm a sucker for all things green chile.  My order was ready in five minutes, max.  The quesadilla is a great value.  The portion is huge and you get a side of chips.  It was cheesy and had a perfect amount of shredded beef.  Oh, and it was delicious!  The salsa verde was wonderful too....I'm glad I grabbed two cups!  They definitely earned five stars. :)"}
{"text":"I really like this truck. For the price though they could give more. Today I barely had any meat in my toro verde quesadilla... They still managed to get a lot of the flavor in it which is why I'm giving them 4 stars. More meat please and you will have 5 stars!"}
{"text":"My favorite food truck of all time for lunch! They are a popular favorite at my office and if you read the reviews you'll see why. My favorite thing they have on the menu is nacho daddy carne asada Nachos. They can feed four of us and be so full. The steak is cooked perfect, chips are perfect. Always great service and let's be ho eat who can turn down Nachos. If you see them at first Friday, Friday family  events or anywhere else around the valley pull over, park, get out and partake of all the yummy goodness."}
{"text":"So nasty. Wish I could've gotten my 10 bucks I wasted on a half of a quesadilla cut into 3's."}
{"text":"If you are at first Friday and you want something refreshing to drink definitely stop by here and try out their agua fresca! They came in a variety of flavors, I had melon (which my friends liked better than the flavor they chose). It is HUGE and comes in a glass mason jar! We got looks from people asking where we got our drink from!  Also, the owner briefly stopped to talk to us and was very sweet! I've been craving this since then!!"}
{"text":"It's hard to get cheesier!      I enjoyed a lovely Quesadilla during a  Mountain Bike race and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food I received. I choose the pulled pork and it was loaded with meat and cheese. There were lots of options and I had a hard time deciding. There was so much I took 2/3 home when the race was done and it was just as good the next day.      The down side was the Salsa. I like it bold. I don't mean hot I mean flavorful. I had the green on the young ladies recommendation. It was OK, but didn't bring anything to the food and really distracted me from it with one bit. It has potential, but needs some TLC to make it stand out like my Quesadilla did.      I would gladly eat here again if this truck was part of a larger group or event. And I don't eat very many Quesadilla's at all. But these have lots of yummy cheese."}
{"text":"My co-worker and I, both vegetarians, wanted a quick bite at the office. So, we trotted down to the Queso Good truck in the parking lot.   Big mistake.  Our identical orders (Shroom Zilla) took 30 minutes to make, 20 of which were wasted waiting before being told the truck was out of mushrooms. That would have been handy information when we ordered.  So, we opted for quesadillas with black bean hummus, guacamole, onions and tomato. We would have gone with refried beans, but the staff didn't know if the beans were vegetarian.  Anyway, their first attempt at our vegetarian quesadillas wound up having carne asada. NOPE.  They tried again, but this time but refried beans in them. NOPE.  Finally, I just asked for a cheese and guacamole quesadilla, and I got a sad and flat meal I could have made at home for $1. In all, it cost $7.50 for a little cheese and a microscopic dab of guacamole on a tortilla. And a side of grocery store tortilla chips.  In all, it took more than 45 minutes to get my food. Complete fail."}
{"text":"Love love love. The limeade was awesome. The steak tacos were awesome. The chicken fajita tacos were awesome. Awesome awesome awesome! Can't wait to hit the chandler food truck Friday again!"}
{"text":"Look, let's not lie to ourselves...a good, hefty quesadilla is a hearty meal that'll put you into a food coma. Queso Good allows you to eat this on the go, but be forewarned...it gets messy! There are about 10 varieties to choose from, but know they all have one thing in common. They're HUGE. This could be two separate meals, but anything is single-serving if you're hungry enough! ;-)  I opted for the \"pork-a-dilla\", stuffed with guacamole, roasted pork, a touch of sour cream, and chorizo. While the tortilla was much too buttery for me, I immediately gorged on the gigantic meal, with the messy contents spilling out into my little basket. Fortunately, they give you a side of tortilla chips to scoop up every bit of goodness. Be sure to pour some of their tasty green salsa over that.  Some say \"you are what you eat\", and I definitely felt like a pig after this meal. I'm not proud of myself--it was probably like a million calories. But I DID feel satisfied for the low, low price of about $8.50, and that's why I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Yesterday, we had Queso Good cater our company picnic. They were terrific! They got there early, had the food ready to go, had a very varied menu that fit everyone's needs and were also willing to change things and make it \"your way\". The staff was cheerful ,and happy to serve us, and the food was perfect! Everyone LOVED it! Big hit with our group. Thank you Queso folks!! You made our picnic easy for us and delicious!"}
{"text":"First time eating at this food truck, it comes pretty often to my work with other food trucks but I was highly disappointed, I ordered nachos with only \"spicy cheddar cheese sauce\" (not spicy) & carne asada and it cost me $8.82! My nachos Taste like gas station nachos and the meat was COLD & had no flavor! Nothing like eating mushy, salty, gross nachos!"}
{"text":"Totally unacceptable. There's a puddle of food juice at the bottom of my plate. So this quesadilla is like trying to eat a dirty diaper."}
{"text":"I've had many food trucks and this one is one of my favorites. The food is really good and I've found the service to be pretty decent. They handle a busy lunch crowd fairly well. Bring back the Buffalo Chicken Quesadilla...that was amazing, but I've only seen them have it once."}
{"text":"OH. MY. LAWD. Ya girl got Queso Good at a residential adult Christmas party. AKA-- one of my amazing friends hired them for dinner, to our surprise for ~40 of us, to park at their house for a few hours, and feed us. All she told us ahead of time was \"pay me $10 for dinner and I'll take care of it.\"   DONE, no questions asked. The girl is a professional event planner for a living.   So humor me as I pull up to their house to help prep last-minute and a giant food truck is parked in front. FOR US! The Queso Good crew! When the party \"officially started\", the guys were ready for the steady stream of hungry and buzzed adults to place their order. We had a few pre-planned options - quesadillas, tacos, or supreme nachos, + rice and beans, a beverage... AND CHURROS! Plus the plethora of side things on their table for dinner and churros.  I opted for the nachos which were swimming in cheese.. so we deemed it nacho soup. There actually is a limit to how much nacho cheese is an acceptable amount for chips. Yep, I said it.  The churros needed more sugar& cinnamon. Mostly the taste was fried dough which is cool and all, but I really was hoping for something better than a TBell dessert.  All in all, definitely worth what I paid (did I mention they had Gatorade as a beverage option for us drunkies) and my friend's work getting them to us!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan. Quesadillas really are a perfect food truck item. Order the Just Say Cheese for the kids. They'll love it. Order pretty much any other quesadilla as an adult and you'll be happy as well. Can't really speak to the tacos, but the quesadillas are generous in size and prices are fairly reasonable. The nachos, as noted by some other reviewers are nothing special, but the kids will be okay with them. Preparation time is fairly quick, certainly not too long a wait for all this cheesy goodness."}
{"text":"4 of us got to enjoy this amazing food truck today in Scottsdale, it was amazing! My oldest daughter has been telling us about it for a while and she was right, It's the best! Only got a picture of the BLT quesadilla but we also enjoyed a carne asada & regular one. Thank you Joseph for the recommendations and Antonia for cooking up some delicious grub! BLT Quesadilla! OMG I thought a BLT in between 2 slices of bread was amazing until I had it in a folded tortilla all nice and buttery crispiness! Can't wait until we meet again"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  We had some of the big wigs at work today, so they decided to get a couple of food trucks.  We had this one and a burger one.  In N Out is like 2 minutes away from work, so if I want a burger, I will head there.  I decided to check out Queso Good and get myself a quesadilla.   I went with a Carne Asada Quesadilla.  Pretty simple...huge flour tortilla, melted cheese, plenty of carne asada, sour cream and guacamole.  It came with about 10 chips and I had some churros for dessert.  All of this was free because work paid for it.  Regularly priced, I think the quesadillas are about $8.00 or so.  It was pretty fat and tasted really good....especially for Phoenix (San Diego Mexican food is still far superior!). The churros were a tad skimp.  It was really like one small churro cut into about 6 pieces.  Tasty enough, but far from great.  The only reason why this place doesn't get higher than 3 stars is because of 2 things..... 1.  They were selling Cokes for $2.00.  We can buy cans of Coke at work for .25 cents.  So whoever purchased a Coke from them, is not too great in math and got ripped off! 2.  My friend had an order of their nachos.  About an hour later, they were bowing to the porcelain God.  Something in those nachos messed them up,  big time!    If I saw them around town, would I come back?  Probably.  I would have to be in the mood though.  It was pretty tasty, filled me up and the lady working in front of the truck was pretty nice.  Can't complain!"}
{"text":"So much grease! Also definitely not enough meat to justify an $8.50 price tag. The guacamole could have been from the packages at safe way, not good. Tortilla was good. What wasn't great was biting into what seemed to be cabbage??? Pretty sure it was old gross wilted lettuce. Not in the description for the pork a dilla. The sour cream was inside the quesadilla so it basically curdled while it cooked. It ended up looking like a white gooey powder on my food."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the Carne Asada Quesadilla at my cousins business opening yesterday and it was muy bien!  The tortilla was fresh, crisp and nicely browned.  The carne was ample-with plenty of ooey gooey cheesiness and creamy guac and sour cream.  Great fast service even with the large crowd!  I will follow this truck!"}
{"text":"Has a great breakfast selection and everything is prices accordingly love when they are in the area!"}
{"text":"Queso Good is Queso Bad.    I was very disappointed with the lack of meat and cheese in my quesadilla.  I'm used to Luncha Libra (United Lunchadoras) quesadilla food truck that packs a TON of meat AND cheese in every quesadilla so I feel like I'm getting a huge bargain paying $8 for it.  The quesadilla I got from this food truck was lackluster, FLAT, bland and frankly, disappointing.  Their guacamole even tasted fake.  It was smooth, no chunks of avocado or tomatoes or anything.  It was a creamy, bland, green cream with NO taste.  Maybe it was just green-colored sour cream? And they only gave me like 1/8 teeny tiny ounce of it. I'm not Tinkerbell.  Give me more!  Give me more!    Usually the cheese holds the flour tortilla together in a quesadilla, but since there was BARELY any cheese, the quesadilla opened up super easy like a soft taco at Taco Bell. There was probably just an ounce or two of meat, if that much.  Usually food trucks give super big portions with so much meat and protein that it's too much for one person, but this truck fails to deliver that type of quantity OR quality.   I will not go to that truck ever again and neither should you!  Remember....Queso Good is ACTUALLY Queso Bad! Don't say I didn't warn you!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! I was having a party for 80 people at my home and Queso Good did not disappoint. From booking the truck with Kimberley- and her patiently answering my many questions, to their accommodations for vegetarian and gluten free guests, everything was perfect and worry free. They arrived on time and were ready to serve food when the party started. I had four options for guests to choose from, and I think the favorite was the shroomzilla dilla quesadilla. Joseph and Miriam were excellent and professional. I highly recommend this food truck."}
