{"text":"I love this place.  The ability to have a fresh pizza is the best.  You are able to see how fresh the ingredients are. Plus it is DELICIOUS! Staff is alway friendly with a smile. Love to see when owners take pride in their business.  This family certainly does."}
{"text":"The staff here are very nice and really seem to take pride in there job. As soon as you walk in you are greated warmly and takes your order right awsy and repeat it back to make sure it is correct. The prep table is always clean as well as the inside. They always mske sure you know how to bake your pie and answer any and all qwestions you might have. The pizza is always good and everything is always fresh."}
{"text":"I almost ate at the D-nos across the street. That would have been a mistake. This pizza kills it. Papa's Favorite is a favorite for a reason. Great crust, perfect pled of spices, meat (sausage pepperoni and ground round) onions mushrooms peppers AND they are really generous with the cheese, which is the good stuff. 
Right now they're having a deal on Tuesday. Worth the trip. Salads desserts soda minis for the kids."}
{"text":"The best quality for the money. Plus, we can add or subtract our toppings at home because everyone has a different preference. Aaaaaaand we can cook it crispy! 

Service was fast and friendly!

Restaurant was clean and it was only $5 for a pepperoni pizza!

Sign up for text discounts and get great deals! Always a great option to have and we enjoy the pizza hot and right out of the oven! And excellent value...

Highly recommend!"}
