{"text":"Sub-par sushi with uncooked rice, much better alternatives not too far away"}
{"text":"This place is great! No frills, no wacky stuff, just tables and chairs and good sushi. I am a huge supporter of family owned and operated small businesses. The family that runs JK is awesome, they are very sweet and want nothing but for you to enjoy your food and visit. This is a perfect example of what we need more of in Phoenix. Go check them out, small intimate dinning area and great sushi!  I did take one star off because of the menu, it is put together very awkwardly(literally) and confusing."}
{"text":"I went there today, spend $100 for a lunch (mostly for takeout) after I done with my meal, paid for my bill, leave a $5 tips for two people, cause we only eat a little in the restaurant and most for Togo! Plus my waitress is really rude, I think $5 is fair with my order! But the older waitress look at the tip that I left on table, try to forced me to leave at lease 10% of tip with my total bill!  Well, with you bad service plus most of my order is for take out! Why I need to tip you as 10% of my total bill? Also, there has no law request a min. Of 10% tip!  Really bad service plus so so food! I think there store manager need to training their waitress again before they service customer!"}
{"text":"Hands down best sushi in town! Chan, Annie and Star had some of the best guest service I've ever had! Amazing prices, amazing service and amazing food! I'm a guest for life, I highly recommend JK Sushi"}
{"text":"Very Friendly, nice price. Nothing fancy but a great local spot when I get a sudden craving"}
{"text":"Very happy.  Made a to go order. Angle Wings are a hit. The Bing Bong Pork or something close to that name was great! Sorry, I'm old and that was probably not P.C.  but these good folks were very friendly and fast. Be back very soon."}
{"text":"Round 2 but happy hour this time  if youre serious about no frills and no trend sushi go here now or regret your existence!!! Another bomb.com experience here! Please go here now!!!!    *****NO FIREARMS ALLOWED*****"}
{"text":"If I could rate this place a negative number I would. Don't ever eat here! Got severe food poisoning from their food and was vomiting for a full 24 hours. This place is no good!"}
{"text":"Very small and cute little place tucked between a Great Clips and a Papa John's. Easy to miss if you're driving by. At first, the name of \"J.K. Sushi\" makes you think it means \"Just Kidding Sushi\" but after entering the restaurant...(pun intended), this place is no joke. It made sense to me that it most likely means \"Japanese Korean Sushi\" given that it serves both Japanese and Korean dishes.  The food here is great for the value! We ordered the Phoenix Roll and Dragon Roll as well as a spicy pork plate. All three dishes were very delicious and the food came quick. The service was wonderful and the staff were very friendly. Also, they have a neat wall where all pictures of their sushi plates are shown for customers to see what they are ordering. Would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The atmosphere was relaxing and the food was top notch. Highly recommend the vegas role along with the dynamite role! 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for about 6 months now. Good sushi and good attentive service. Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I had the spicy tuna roll during happy hour and I would have to say it was a disappointment...the tuna was okay but the rice was hard and not fresh at all..and the temperature of the place was horrible seemed like there AC wasn't working."}
{"text":"Customer service was great, however I didn't come here for that. I'm extremely disappointed. I've been here couple of times wanting to give them a second chance, because everyone deserves second chances right?? Well I was let down again. California roll, Texas roll, and the JK roll taste doughy. The food doesn't taste fresh & comes out so quickly, which is questionable. I don't recommend this place if you're a sushi lover. Two stars just for the customer service."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and it isn't too bad. I had the Spicy Tuna Roll and Spicy California Roll, besides being a bit too thick with rice they were bomb!! They do need stronger wasabi though."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for 7 years and LOVE it!!! It's family owned, they are fantastic.  They have watched my kids grow. You can't go wrong with any of the food, SUPERB!!!!"}
{"text":"Super Good Sushi!  The lion roll is spicy Tuna with cucumber and is so fresh tasting. The summer roll has spicy tuna with cream cheese cucumber and salmon on the top with eel sauce. Very tasty. We highly recommend for our North phoenix friends."}
{"text":"This place deserves one of the best reviews on here. I ate 3 types of rolls all were very nicely presented and the quality was amazing! I ate at the bar so that's why I don't understand that someones review said there was not one. The service was absolutely fantastic and very friendly I felt that the service and for the type of place it was the atmosphere fit it perfectly. I will be there every single time if I have a choice on where I am going to eat sushi. EXTREMELY satisfied with this restaurant wouldn't have Ever second guessed my choice! A million thumbs up"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere and great service. It's easy to tell how much pride the owners take in this place. Also, awesome prices.  Quality ingredients and everything tasted fresh. Plus, I enjoy supporting local restaurants as opposed to large chain restaurants. If you need a sushi fix and aren't in the mood to spend a bunch of money, I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"This was by far the WORST sushi restaurant (if you can even call it that) I have ever been to. The sushi menu is on the wall with big pictures and no descriptions. To start, I ordered the crab angels and calamari. My girlfriend and I were expecting crab wontons, but what came out of the back room was nothing close. It was basically a puff pastry filled with imitation crab...and that was the best part of our whole meal! The calamari was so tough and bland we couldn't eat more than a bite of it. The miso soup that came out beforehand had hardly any tofu in it and tasted very watered down. I ordered the sashimi plate with salmon, tuna, and yellow tail, all of which were old, warm and chewy. My girl ordered the fire roll which was decent, but the only flavor came from the siracha on top of the roll. We left close to ten minutes after our food came and went to McDonalds down the street. As a server you should know that when the customers don't even touch their food something is wrong!! Should've listened to our gut when we heard of the name \"JK\" because this place really is a JOKE!"}
{"text":"Best sushi we have ever had.  My wife and I are about halfway through all of the menu selections.  Not a fancy place; Yet another thing that we like.  Cold beers and saki bombers, great healthy fun food makes us keep coming back for more.  Thanks to our niece and her husband for turning us on to J&K."}
{"text":"After passing(and judging) this place multiple times on my way to Fry's, I had never stopped in.  I LOVE sushi with a capital \"Get in my belly,\" but with the strip mall location and pictures of the menu items displayed on the windows, I choose to skip over this hidden gem.  That is, until one hungover day I was craving Tempura Udon soup.  I hopped on Yelp, saw their menu, and choose to give JK Sushi a try.  Boy was I glad I did!  I ended up also ordering a caterpillar roll, edamame, and ikura sushi to go(adventurous I know!)  Everything was fabulous!  The soup was so amazing, and at $5.75 I was very impressed.  The soup did not come with any tempura, but usually when it does at other restaurants it can range from $10-12.  Since then my boyfriend and I have been back a couple time.  Each time they are very friendly, we are seatied right away, and the pictures on the wall actually help me decide on something new.  Overall, highly recommended!  They have only beer, wine, and saki, and the saki bombs are a little pricey.  I would love to see a happy hour menu here someday, but wishful thinking.  Oh and something I figured out about the 3rd time I was there.  JK stands for Japanese and Korean.  I have tried 2 of their Korean dishes, and they all come with rice and 4 little side dishes(kimchi, potato, spicy cucumbers, ect)."}
{"text":"Love this place!  If you're tired of franchise joints, check out this true mom and pop restaurant. Nice happy hour too."}
{"text":"I enjoy this food every time. I am trying to taste all of the rolls. 1 roll at a time. 2nd time here and will be back."}
{"text":"HUGE FAN! We've been supporting this place for several years and tell people about it whenever the subject of sushi comes up. The quality of food is wonderful, the prices are fair and the service is excellent.  This is a family operated, local business and should be on the radar of anyone who like sushi."}
{"text":"My fiance n I love coming here to get away and have amazing Japanese/ Korean dishes. The sushi is super fresh and the hot dishes never disappoint! One thing I really like is being greeted by the sweetest owner you'll ever meet! He's always all smiles and prepares all your sushi carefully, really showing how much he loves the art that it is. He's also been making a lot of great new renovations that's worth checking out!!"}
{"text":"The sushi here is great and so are the prices but the service is hit or miss. Especially if you are phoning in an order. The place will be dead and you'll be the only one to order and somehow they will still screw up your order.   I don't know if there is a disconnect between the waitress and the Sushi Chef but it's happened enough times to me personally that I'd consider trying somewhere else.    Update: Tonight was a Hit. Would go again."}
{"text":"Spicy tuna and crispy rice roll sooooo good! The owners let me substitute avocado instead of cream cheese. No charge! Wow awesome."}
{"text":"I debated between giving them 4 or 5 stars. Here's why: If I was rating the staff, I would rate them a solid 5. They always remember us when we go there and they are super friendly. If I was rating the food on taste, I would rate it a 4.5 to 5. Most of the food is really great, but I would have to downgrade the rating to a 4 because some of it can be a little bit expensive. This is truly a hole in the wall place (as others have said), so I'm not as understanding of the prices as I would be if I was eating at a place with more ambiance. Nevertheless, I will continue to eat here, because the food is addicting. And, thanks for being so close to my home!"}
{"text":"This was the best hole-in-the-wall sushi place. The owners were very nice and greeted me instantly. Also, it was the best tasting sushi. I will definitely continue going back to get my fill!"}
{"text":"My weekly spot.  I take my daughter here once a week for lunch bento boxes.  A great deal- you get a huge meal for about 7.99 and the owners/staff are super friendly.  Great sushi place!"}
{"text":"Sushi was subpar!  So chronological. ... eat sushi at this joint a  ladies bathroom visit revealed. .....WE SHOULD HAVE NOT EATEN THERE!!!  Maybe the Bob Marley music playing in an oriental foodery  was a clue.  Maybe that a spoon taped to the order pencil was a clue! After all I might want to steal the pencil. Maybe the soy sauce drenched sushi roll was a clue. The only thing I know was trustworthy was the Kirin beer in the bottle.  I'm ready for the apocalypse. I now know that I can't stomach the Cockroach and prevail.  Pictures of the roaches  posted to their page !"}
{"text":"This place is a COMPLETE disappointment! I went in and noticed there was Ramen on the menu. I was very excited because I hadnt had Ramen in a whileeeee. Ordered Ramen. It was like $10.  Ramen came out... It was literally watered down Top Ramen!! The chicken it came with was just boiled in water. It had noooo taste. I told my server... She apologized and said they don't do refunds... Uhmmm...   I didn't even take more than a bite of the basic tasteless ramen they served me....  My boyfriend wanted to just walk out but I ended up paying $10 for some watered down Top Ramen that I could have made better for 10 cents!   If you have ever had legit asian food, this place will be disappointing."}
{"text":"The real definition of \"mom and pop\". In this city of franchise restaurants, it's nice to see this place survive for at least the last 8 years that I've lived here. Friendly staff, father makes the sushi, mother makes the food in the kitchen. Overwhelming flavors that won't disappoint. I think I have tried everything on the menu twice over. Not one complaint from me."}
{"text":"Just be forewarned that if you are not satisfied with the quality of the food they will not refund your money. They only do exchanges. I got the Ramen and it was watered down and tasted like the Ramen you can buy for 10¢ at your local grocery store. My bf got the yakisoba and it was pretty lackluster as well.... Prices are outrageous for the quality of food. Not impressed at all..."}
{"text":"I love this place. My mom and I have been here several times and it is always great. Seems somewhat \"hole-in-the-wall-esq\" but it is worth it. Their rolls are amazing and they are priced fairly as well. I have never had an issue with anything thus far."}
{"text":"If you want real sushi you must try this place!  I come here whenever I need my sushi fix!  Service is great!"}
{"text":"Yelpers got it right on this one. This place is a-okay. The sushi was good but the atmosphere and missing bar stopped me from giving it 4 stars. With most food, I like hole in the walls and I'm not to big on atmosphere. But with sushi I think it is important. But in terms of sushi quality, it was good. They had a huge variety and the price was reasonable. But yen in only a few miles down the street and WAY worth the extra drive!"}
{"text":"This place is one of North Phoenix's hidden gems. It's unassuming, but delicious. It's also very clean!!! The wait staff is very attentive, and you're always greeted with a friendly \"hello\" from the owners.   My husband and I always get the JK roll which is cooked with fish on top and a heavenly mayo based sauce. Their fried rice is just addictive... it's hard to put your spoon down. I recently had the saba gui, and it was fantastic. Definitely salted just right, with a perfect amount of oil. One of my favorite dishes is the dolsot bibimbap.  It's hearty, and is just like what your Korean mom might make at home, but better."}
{"text":"become a Fan of J.K. Sushi on FaceBook - http://bit.ly/FAsHM  J.K. Sushi is also a Korean restaurant and not only is their Sushi great quality and affordable, their Korean dishes are authentic and very very tasty.  Our family judges a Korean Restaurant by their Kimchi Jjigae, that's the flagship dish.  If the jjigae is good, then it get's a big thumbs up us and J.K.'s has some of the best we've tasted.  We've been going to J.K.'s since 2006 and since relocated right around the corner....couldn't be any happier.  Another member mentioned the photographs on the Wall, it's great for everyone to see the food, not just read it on the menu, also they've added some new dishes.  One dish is called an Avocado Salad, I'll post those photos, you should try it, you'll like it.  J.K. Sushi is a hidden treasure for Sushi Lovers and Bulgogi fans, I would definitely recommend J.K.'s. to anyone who enjoys great food and a friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem that needs to be discovered by sushi lovers everywhere! Our experience was absolutely fantastic from the lovely and welcoming staff to the delicious food. If you want fast, fresh, and good food, this is your place. Thank you, J. K. Sushi for everything!!!"}
{"text":"The people were nice, but the food sucked!! Tastes like everything is microwaved, and believe me, you can even hear it ding when it's ready. No pictures, only on the wall.. Like I said the server and cook were super nice, but the food isn't. If you're a sushi lover, this is not the place to go."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi spots in the valley. Happy hour from 8-10! Sushi is delicious and fresh. I have tried almost every roll, have no complaints with any of them. The prices are great as well."}
{"text":"So I went here for the first time. Read reviews and seems decent to try. I order the Spicy Tuna roll, Rainbow roll and the Super Shrimp roll. I saw pictures of the super shrimp roll and it looked so good. When I got home and opened the box it looked nothing like the other pics I saw(see picture). It was extremely dry and soaked in soy sauce. My spicy tuna was NOT spicy and also very dry. The Rainbow roll was the only decent one but there was huge chunks of Ginger on it and was a little over powering. Loved the customer service, loved the prices but I guess I got what I paid for!"}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly good! It is very much so a hope in the wall and I will admit that the name, JK (translating to me to just kidding) was kind of a put off but they totally changes my mind. My roommate and I came at a normal dinner time so we missed happy hour thus it was a tad expensive but the sushi was very fresh tasting so it is a fair deal. Neither my roommate's not my miso came with seaweed but that was included in the meal so that is a wash. One of our rolls (I believe the Osaka roll) came out looking great and it did taste good but it seemed like it was missing something that could've but it over the top. I think the other rolls we got were the sweet and sour and the fire roll and those were both perfect.   Spark-notes version:  good place where you get your money's worth. Will come again! Probably go happy hour!"}
{"text":"We have been here twice now, and both times were great, A++!!!   On our first visit we just ordered two orders of the Spicy California rolls, then on our second visit, we ordered two orders of their avocado rolls, which by the way are only like $3 for 6 pieces, and one order of the spicy California roll, with also an order of their Teriyaki chicken with white rice and four small veggie sides.  *** The food was good, but I think what keeps us wanting to come here is the wonderful customer service, they have been AWESOME to us,  we were greeted with an honest smile and we were well taken care of during our entire dining experience there!!!  There is a really sweet and kind guy and girl that work at the register too, they are both extra awesome!! We will keep coming for more, hopefully to slowly but surely try-out there entire menu, eventually!!!"}
{"text":"They have really friendly service & great prices. I love the crispy rice jalapeno salmon. Delicious"}
{"text":"Ok this place is amazing don't let anybody tell you otherwise lol. Fast, clean, good food and the environment is very intimate and quiet and peaceful. It seems like a family restaurant which is why it's better than those big restaurants. They have a lot of menu choices"}
{"text":"Favorite place for sushi, such a cool little place with its own style! Don't judge its food on the humble location, the inside is always nice and clean and it's happy hour makes a sushi feast affordable. They are never very busy and seem like a well kept secret worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Awesome. We had the seaweed (wakame) salad appetizer, which tasted different from the others I have had, quote good! And we had ettuce leaves with bean paste (which tasted house made). I had the kalbi and my GF had a bibimbap (hot pot). Everything was really good. My only comment: the miso soup was exceedingly mild, almost too watery. And the banchan could use a little more variety but the kimchi was perfect for me (I had two bowls). Good service, pleasant conversation, and yeah, we will be back, as we're planning on trying everything on the menu eventually!"}
{"text":"highly recommend!  very fresh sushi  attentive staff   and you cant beat the prices!  Perfect Sushi joint!"}
{"text":"A good and unpretentious sushi restaurant with friendly staff and several vegan options.  If you're looking for a place with big egos and sex appeal, this isn't it. They will put good food in your stomach and treat you like a valued customer, but don't go here looking to get wasted on sakai-bombers and listen to shitty techno."}
{"text":"We try sushi places all over the valley and a lot of them are not worth the price you pay but we've been coming here for many years and I love this place. Everyone I bring here loves it too. It is definitely our go-to spot. Good prices, friendly staff, great family running it and great sushi! Love their jalepeño poppers and crab angels!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service, great food, & very reasonable prices! Family owned & all around high quality. One of my favorite sushi restaurants on that side of town. Their teriyaki salmon is sushi grade & extremely high quality. They also have a very good Korean BBQ menu. Great place!"}
{"text":"My family stopped by Fry's Supermarket a few doors down to pick up some groceries.  Seeing that there was as sushi restaurant nearby, I decided to pick up something.  I ordered a few items for take-out.  After looking at the menu, I noticed that they served Korean dishes as well.   Where are the prices for the rolls?  Okay.  I'll find out once I pay.  The salmon teriyaki came with miso soup that tasted like water with a few cubes of tofu.  Preserved Korean side dishes came with the entree, but the side dishes weren't ready yet.  They lacked flavor and taste.  The spicy scallop hand roll was really small and had very small scallops in them.  They are very limited menu for sushi rolls.  I forgot the name of the roll that I got, but it was supposed to be topped with raw salmon.  Where was my salmon?  Oh, it was cut paper-thin and some crab meat was covering it up.  They didn't mess up the CA roll.  I barely got any ginger or wasabi.  The rice used seemed different than rice normally used for making sushi.    I should've driven a few blocks to Hana Sushi."}
{"text":"Don't recommend stopping here for a weekend lunch. Sat down and ordered a caterpillar roll and water. After she took menu and order, I saw on the chalkboard they have plum wine with the actual ume (plum) in it for $5, with a picture and an arrow pointing to the fruit in the bottom of the glass. So I ordered it, pointing to the picture on the board, plum wine please. Came out with no fruit, so I asked her, pointing to the board again, asking why it had no fruit and she said they were out. Bill came priced more than the $5, again questioned it. She talked to the chef and learned she served me the wrong thing, but didn't adjust the bill. And the caterpillar roll was marginal, the nori tasted like the humidity had softened the seaweed to a mushy texture. Got to thinking if they can't keep the nori fresh, what's happening with the fish?? Won't find out, because I won't go back."}
{"text":"This place is located next to Great Clips. The sushi is great, especially the Las Vegas roll and the Nagoya roll. The latter is mind blowing! The only drawback from the menu is the sunomono doesn't taste very good, and the \"creamy\" cucumber salad was horrifying. I will def stick to what I like.   JK also has happy hours with discounted prices, so check it out!"}
{"text":"We were looking for Korean food to tame a craving. We were sorely disappointed by the bibimbap which was mostly rice.  The most anglicized version of Korean I've ever had for $13.95!  We had shrimp fried rice to fill out the meal. 4 pieces of shrimp and fried in vegetable oil and butter!! No sesame oil. Craving unsatisfied."}
{"text":"We went to three Sushi restaurants looking for a good meal.. We ended up here because they were the only one open on a Sunday in the area.. Elise our server was fast courteous & kind.. I'm a non seafood eater and she went out of her way to make sure that everything that I had was without seafood in a sushi restaurant. I believe this place is locally owned small business."}
{"text":"Great price cool reggae music good sushi and tempura cool world beat vibe one of our faves"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with this place. Ate some sushi (to go) and didn't expect the best. Turned out to be awesome. Prices during happy hours is exactly what I look for. Nice."}
{"text":"Overall the sushi was pretty good. Not the best that I have had but for a quick dinner for the family it is good. For the quality of the food I would say that it was a little expensive but it beats going to McDonalds or other \"fast\" food restaurants.  We had edamame (didn't come with salt), Shrimp Tempura roll, California roll, Shrimp Nigiri, Crab Nigiri and Chicken Teriyaki bowl. One thing we found was odd- they didn't have the typical Japanese soups."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, I have been to most sushi places in Arizona, from Tuscon to Flagstaff. This place serves THE BEST sushi ever!!!The food was so good and I want to comment on the Nigiri Sushi. Most places don't prepare the fish right or the rice for that matter. Mind you, these are important. There is an art and craft to sushi making. This place does it right. The Maguro was perfect. It was smooth, crunchy, and perfect in size. Most places make the sushi to bland, the rice stale, and huge, which is not a plus in my opinion. This place made them perfect in size and taste.   I will forever come to this place only for sushi. Bookmarked for sure too. :)"}
{"text":"I have been frequenting this place for about 10 years now.  It has in my opinion and experience fallen from what I once would have given it a 5 star a few years back but no more.  I thought maybe I had a bad day a few months ago and thought Id go again and give them another try.  I love Korean food, especially Kalbi in the dinner entree so this is what I orders for lunch...at $22 bucks its not cheap.  Kalbi is not a very tender cut to begin with because it is connective tissue but got this for lunch and the first three pieces were nothing but grizzle...which tells me it didnt get heated at a high enough temp or a bad cut of meat.  So I told the server to take it back and I ordered a Bulgogi in its place.  While waiting I knibbled on the little Kimchi dishes and rice.  When the entree was brought I asked if she could refill 2 or 3 of the Kimchi dishes and she said it would an extra cost...about a spoons full of vegetables.  So this kinda set me off and told her I have been coming there for 10 years and all...never charged an additional for replenishing the Kimchi dishes and I asked for the bill...paid the $18 plus dollars for three pieces of grizzle, a table spoons worth of rice and two teaspoons of cabbage...told them Id never be back.  I used to love this place."}
{"text":"Great place to try different rolls, so good!   Clean quiet place with no waiting and you can relax there.  rice could be better.  Super nice folks.  Price more like $20 per person."}
{"text":"This place is super chill and good food. My first ramen experience here. It is Korean not Japanese ramen so it's a little different. Friendly staff. Great service"}
{"text":"Lunch stop here blew my budget and was a disappointment. Certainly I don't mind paying for good sushi but standard rainbow roll had very little fish and no personality. Hand roll of salmon skin had unrecognizable crumbs of fried something. Even ginger condiment was a small pile of half shavings. Edamame was not fresh. Prices inappropriate for quality & ambience; too many wooden fence panels indoors for me.  Restaurant was clean. Server provided entrees while talking on the phone."}
{"text":"We stopped in for take-out, so I can only comment on the food. We had the \"Lion\" Roll, \"Super Shrimp Tempura\" Roll, \"Spicy Crunch Dynamite\" Roll and a modified \"New York\" Roll. We were both pleasantly surprised  with all the rolls we ordered. I can honestly say we will be ordering food from J.K. Sushi again soon."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The minute you walk in, you're greated by either Starr or Chen.  The place is small and doesn't get too crowded. The place is always clean and the entire staff is friendly and always on top of things.   They have pictures on the walls if you're in question on what your food will look like, which I found very creative of them to do. They do have a mixture of Korean and Japanese food.  I usually just get the sushi, so whatever you're craving, Japansese or Korean, or a little of both, head on over to J.K. sushi."}
{"text":"Good hole in the wall type of place, never is busy.  Only bitch is the waitress was up our ass, she might as well have stood next to us and pulled empty plates out from under us as we lifted the last piece of sushi.  Not much for atmosphere either, if you like to dine in alley ways behind the homeless shelter, you'll feel right at home here."}
{"text":"I am confused about the previous reviews - unless something has changed drastically in the recent past, the previous reviewers are sushi noobs or have very little discretion or taste.  The place is clean, the service is prompt and kind, and that's where the positives end.  The food (what there was of it) tasted great... but a 3/4' diameter salmon roll?  Please.  Long story short - the prices are high for the tiny portions you get, and while the complimentary miso soup and half a chilled orange were nice touches, I'll be skipping this place in the future.  Try Akai-hana on I-17 and Northern if you want the real deal for less $."}
{"text":"The sushi here isn't that exciting. I tried a few things off of the menu for lunch, sans alcohol (who is this woman!) and it was okay. It was quiet inside for a Saturday lunch (we were the only two people in there!) and the waitress - Star - was very helpful in choosing a roll or two when we had trouble choosing. I feel like it's clean and fresh, I only say 3 stars because it could be better, and there are better places around town."}
{"text":"Landed here not by choice, but the first 2 places we went to weren't open on Sunday!!!  Well, we couldn't be happier!!  Like a previous review said...  Nothing fancy, no bells and whistles...  Just a place with chairs, tables and Sushi!  Prices are affordable, food is amazing, service couldn't be better!  The sushi chefs, who might even be the owner came out to our table at the end to make sure we enjoyed our food!  They have for sure gained 2 lifetime customers!  They have a great happy hour as well so we will be coming back for some of that!"}
{"text":"I am so glad we stumbled across this gem. family vibe. incredible chefs. beautifully fresh salmon. yes. yes. yes. yes."}
{"text":"Not really bad, not really great. Food and service is nothing above average. Save yourself the trip and grab sushi elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great  little whole in the wall Sushi place. The customer service was very good our host/waiter was really on the ball and had excellent presence.   My husband had  a few Korean Dishes that were suggested and her really like them . My daughter has Her standard choices of Salmon, red snapper, maguro and  yellowtail .  They looked  very fresh and she pronounced them delicious  .   My caterpillar roll was good but not the best but I 'd order again just because I like caterpillar rolls.   We saw many other rolls that looked great  and we will try them next time."}
{"text":"Service was amazing and the food was so delicious. My boyfriend and I went on a date there and we got California rolls, vegas rolls, 2 servings of shrimp tempaura, California rolls, we each got a sacki bomb and I got a glass of wine and a Dr Pepper and it was all only $40 which is absolutely  amazing and our server was so sweet and made sure we were completely taken care of. My new favorite spot!!!"}
{"text":"It has everything you need from Chinese to sushi! Why not! Went to with 4 people and sent 30$! And sushi is high quality too! Their fried rice is like none other"}
{"text":"Yes, it is a small place. But they make up for their shortcomings by serving very good food."}
{"text":"Ok so heres the deal. I have had alot of sushi in my time at many different places. Out if all these years I have had one bad experience. That is here at J.K Sushi The room was pretty dang warm, not the biggest of deals but warm none the less.  We had the lunch bowl with eel and the caterpillar, with the crunchy roll salmon jalapeno. The beginning starter which was the miso soup was bland and flavorless. I was like ok no big deal. The lunch bowl came out. The chicken was fried with a bottled sauce thrown on top after cooked. No real flavor and bit down on some cartlidge a few times, the vegetables were under cooked also lacking in any kind of flavor. So now we have our sushi. The sliced brownish tented green caterpillar came out and it was ok. Nothing special no biggie. Its the same for the other sushi except the eel. Eel is my favorite sushi anywhere that serves it. I try it here and my eel doesnt smell right. I take a bite and to my surprise it doesn't taste good. Not a good as flavor but i honestly think they served me bad eel. The smell was so bad i can smell it as she brought it out. We pay our bill and then she asks why i didn't tip. I was very nice to her and I explained it to her in a very nice manor and she pretended not to understand me and walked away. This was my first trip and my last. I don't ever not tip which was also a first time for me. I felt bad till she snubbed me."}
{"text":"My roommate and I go here all the time and we love this place!  The prices are great and the sushi is even better!  The service is outstanding! With every meal you receive a bowl of tofu soup, which takes a bit to get used to but it will grow on you.  All the sushi rolls are pictured on the wall which is a great way to help you pick out what you want.  There is no alcohol served so this would not be the place to go for a night out but for  a quiet place to eat some great sushi, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"I really want to give this place another star but cant as of yet. It is Korean family owned. They are in the process of getting their liqour license so their menu's were a bit confusing. They didnt have the beer pictured on the menu and they were out of or did not have what we really wanted to order from the menu. No fatty tuna etc etc. I suggest either not having those menus out or marking out what is not available. It was a bit confusing.   We finally started with the green mussels and crab angels they were ok. Imitation crab eh, the Ikura was good see pics. The kid loves those damn things. The roll we ordered tasted really good but I cant remember the name, it had red snapper on top it came apart easily and their mayonnaise sauce was a little too orange looking compared to what I have seen. The meat eaters seemed to love the dolsot bibimpap with all the little sides. The tuna titaki was different hardly seared at all.   I have been here before its a cute little place I love the staff they are super nice. There was tons of people picking up food while we ate. There were also several other diners being served. The best thing about this place is the pictures of all the dishes on the walls I think that is pure genius.   The new sign says J.K. Sushi it was also known as The Japanese Bawl not bowl. I agree with Aletheia on this place though, it truly is better than Hana on 7th Ave. http://www.yelp.com/biz/jk-bowl-phoenix   I really hope they get their liquor license soon before Ah-So opens up at Norterra."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi, great service and very friendly sushi chef. Dining area is nice too! I go here all the time."}
{"text":"Sushi fine  Inside temp little warm makes me think fish might be also Happy hour menu minimal Customer service brought out booze id after"}
{"text":"Can't stop, won't stop eating at JK Sushi! Let's just say I detested sushi for the longest time ever until I tried this sushi. I've been going here for 4+ years and it's always a nice experience to see the owner of the restaurant, the chef make the sushi. They already know me by name which is advantageous because I get free dessert every now and then ;))) Speaking of desserts if you check it out make sure you try their green tea ice cream :) yummy, yummy, yummy in my tummy. Their menu keeps growing! The recently added alcoholic drinks to their menu, HELLO A+ to that! Them Spicy California rolls are only ~$4.00 and they are glorious! nothing fancy, nothing complicated just something delish enough to satisfy that tummy. Highly recommended! It's nice to go eat somewhere were you are always greeted with a happy attitude. Like previous reviews have mentioned don't be fooled by the appearance, is the food that takes the experience to a whole different level. As I am writing this review I can't stop thinking about their sushi, too bad they close in 30 mins or else I would go her a roll. Just THE BOMB.COM!!!!"}
{"text":"It's awesome how this place combines korean dishes with japanese food choices.  I was able to get a korean dish named 'daji balkogi' (I believe that's how it was spelled) at the same time as my favorite sushi rolls.  The miso soup they bring to you as part of your meal is always great as well.  They do not serve alcoholic beverages (saki is not a choice), so keep that in mind.  It's small but worth the visit.  They are good people, I love them."}
{"text":"Awesome little hole in the wall. The sushi is good, although, some of the hot rolls were a little bit too cool. However, the service more than made up for it. Now that I know about it and its right down the street, it will be a staple!"}
{"text":"Sometimes we have off days and sometimes maybe it's not your jam.  Needless to say, I'm always open to try new places regardless of the Yelp reviews.  JK Sushi seemed like it was on the fences when checked the reviews, but I went for it anyways.    I brought my two friends along for the ride.  The pace is small and dink and we were the only guest during lunch hour on a Friday; it was quiet....too quiet.  We started off with some rolls, the Hana, Dragon, and Las Vegas.  My take was it was overly doused with sweet brown sauce and literally I didn't need to dip my rolls in soy sauce because of it.  The Vegas was probably the best of the 3 with a crunch to it from be fried.   Moreover, we also ordered the Japchae, Bulgogi, and the spicy pork Bulgogi.  Japchae had a slight hint of Sesame Oil which I rather have more then less of, but good on the texture with the boy choy.  The Bulgogi unfortunately smelled like it was old and sitting in the freezer for some times.  As for the spicy pork; my friend said he couldn't taste anything except spice and boy was he sweating.    In the end, I think I'll pass on this place, but what really made me pass is both my friends didn't feel too well after their visit.  Service was good overall, but we were the only guest.  Again, was it an off day or was it business as usual?  I don't know but I generally hate giving 1 stars to a place that tries, however I have to be honest for my readers. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"What I love most about JK Bowl is their super-personal service. It's a small family run business, and overtime my family and friends and I have made friends with Chan and his family.   This is our go-to place for dolsot bibimbap (korean stone bowl with veggies, meat, and rice mixed with some hot red sauce) and some fresh, relatively cheap sushi. the korean food is ok - perhaps not the best in the valley, but quite satisfactory. i really like their sushi - they have some fun, creative rolls, along with more traditional sushi, all nice and fresh, and on the cheap side."}
{"text":"The waiter was the most condescending jerk I've ever encountered. My girlfriend and I went there a few nights ago to try them out. We ordered a seafood pancake, which we have had at several other Korean owned restaurants in multiple states, as well as in Asian countries. It came out soggy and slimy, and when the waiter saw we only had two bites, asked us if everything was alright. We very sheepishly and politely told him it was a little soggy, and he dismissively retorted, \"Oh it must be the SEAFOOD in there.\" I asked if I could get a vegetable tempura instead and write off the price difference. He said that was fine, and ended up charging us $19 each for two little bottles of nigori sake, while most places charge 8-10 dollars. Obviously gouging us to make up for the pancake. When I tried to talk to him about it, he laughed in my face and said that's the retail price. I found it on my phone from bevmo for nine bucks but he wasn't hearing it. My little story here just doesn't do justice to how amazingly rude he was. Never going back. As we walked out after paying the ridiculous bill, he had to toss one last comment to my back, \"Have a good night at retail price.\" What a dick."}
{"text":"I love pictures. I love pictures of male athletes. I love pictures of good hair. I love pictures of food. But I love pictures of every dish offered on the wall of JK Sushi the most.  I had a monster craving for sushi so I ventured to JK for takeout. 2 avocado rolls, 1 Las Vegas roll [to celebrate booking the MGM Grand for the 15th-17th], 1 veggie roll, 1 order of crab angels. 15 minute wait, and the place had 0 patrons dining dining inside. The hostess wasn't too talkative but maybe just shy? All that ran me $25, you make the call on price.  Took my bounty home, and enjoyed Robert Downey, Jr. as Sherlock Holmes as I also enjoyed my sushi. The Vegas roll was tasty, but different from what I've had [the entire roll covered in crispy tempura]. The avocado rolls were wonderful, my old stand-by and forever simple favorite. The veggie rolls are where it got weird. Cream cheese, cucumber, avocado, and rubbery lettuce. I've never seen lettuce in a sushi roll. It wasn't good. It made me feel weird. And it was rubbery. I didn't eat but a couple pieces.  It's not the best, but it's good when you just have a craving."}
{"text":"Had the super shrimp tempura roll & spicy tuna both were great. The chicken Korean BBQ was not my cup of tea. My boyfriend enjoyed it. Ordered the crazy dragon roll & was not appealing. Would eat here again but stick to my first 2 rolls. Good service."}
{"text":"Stopped by after a workout.  Service was fabulous!  Sashimi was very fresh w/ buttery texture.  Rolls are super flavorful and innovative (some I had never heard of and had to look up).  Plating was creative.  There is more than sushi on the menu, but I was looking for light protein.  Will definitely be back to JK's for sushi and to try the other menu items.  YUM!"}
{"text":"My husband & I are frequent diners here. We love that it's family-owned, they always remember us & are always very friendly & sweet. The sushi, as well as the other dishes we've tried are always delicious.  The California rolls are probably the freshest, best rolls in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing.... Especially being family run. I had just got my husband a Chef from work and decided to take out.   The Dad\"chef owner\" was right this was the best sushi ever and service was great. Will try new rolls soon.thank you all"}
{"text":"On a Friday night and had sushi on my mind with the taste buds speaking to me! I have passed by this particular establishment many of times,  as its hidden on the backend of plaza on the SE corner of 7th street and bell road. My mission was to place an order to go and continue my Friday night at home. This place is small and intimate sushi bar with its typical order menu. I placed an order to go of a Yellowtail Roll and Calamari Tempura Rolls. The wait time was under ten minutes, and this was with a decent crowd dining in. The Yellowtail rolls were fresh and tasty and the Calamari Tempura Roll was very crunchy with big pieces of calamari inside the rolls. The things I got out of my meal was the freshness of the rolls and the rapid service to prepare the rolls. Sorry as I was so hungry I have no pics to share, but there will always be next time!"}
{"text":"Don't even think of coming here! Ramen is instant! Told the waitress about it and you can't even get a refund! What a horrible business! Please save your hard earned money,  take it somewhere else!"}
{"text":"This is the best, freshest sushi I've found in Phoenix. I was born and raised in southern florida, so I know what fresh seafood tastes like, and have been disappointed in the past trying to find something fresh in Phoenix without paying an arm and a leg. J.K. is very simple, family owned, sushi restaurant. You're not gonna find thousand dollar decorations, or sushi that's more about presentation than flavor. They focus on amazing, simple flavors and it really shines through.  Plus, who can beat california rolls for 3.50?! And don't even get me started on the happy hour, 5 dollar sake bombs, tempura fried rolls...heaven."}
{"text":"I don't quite understand why this place has 4 stars or so. I've only been here once and that was enough for me. The service is not the greatest, we had to wait  for a while before we got our food. The sushi rolls were ridiculously small and not fresh enough. On top of all that they charged a lot. I dont know if they were holding back on some fish or what but 4 or 5 rolls equal $50? kinda sounds silly if you ask me, especially if the sushi is half the size. The rice was kinda of hard and the fish wasn't the best. Im a huge supporter for the mom and pop businesses but this restaurant did not meet my needs."}
{"text":"They have some really delicious, creative rolls! They also have a great happy hour from 2-5 and 8-close with $5 sake bombs and several rolls!"}
{"text":"Disgusting rancid fish. I'm not even exaggerating that the tuna was smelly, slimy, and warm. The owners who are also the chefs didn't even apologize for the quality. I've been here a few times before and it was okay- certainly not the freshest but passable. This time is was bad and I was further disappointed the staff didn't offer an explanation or apology. I will not ever return and hope I don't get sick from the bite I had!"}
{"text":"Just moved here, abd all i have to say is THE PHOENIX ROLL!! hands down one of the best rolls i have ever had. They have a great happy hour also."}
{"text":"Tonight was the first time my girlfriend and I ate here after living around the corner of the past 9+ months.  The sushi was very good and the service was very nice and accommodating.  We had the Spicy Dynamite, the JK Special, and the California Roll.  All were excellent and had a very nice presentation.  The egg roll appetizer was disappointing.  They were more like veggie spring rolls than egg rolls really, but I wouldn't rate a restaurant on just a few egg rolls.  My girlfriend and I will be back here for sure!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and attention to detail. Always smiling staff and very clean inside love this place definitely our go too sushi spot"}
{"text":"This little family run place has wonderful sushi!  The owners are Korean, but they serve sushi and many traditional Japanese dishes in addition to their own Korean Bulkogi.  I prefer their sushi and their tempura over the Korean dishes.  The sushi is well crafted and fresh.  The have a nice light tempura and several other nice dishes.  It is quite inexpensive.  I like to pick up a few rolls to share with friends  on the way home"}
{"text":"Great place , we love going in there , casual laid back friendly atmosphere ,, fresh , tasty !!  One of our favorites!"}
{"text":"JK Sushi is a great local spot where you get great service! Chan was my server tonight and he was always attentive. This is my go to spot for catching up with friends for a nice Korean dish, a side of sushi, and a sake bomb to top off my meal. Chan is always friendly and always remembers what I previously ordered and makes great suggestions that never fail."}
{"text":"Dined here for first time this afternoon.  JK really does have all of the true components of a dive sushi place:  *Pictures of various sushi (from the mid-80s) gracing the pressboard walls *One wall being unfinished raw lumber (maybe they're replacing the fake walls?) *Plastic flowers with copious amounts of dust in the women's (onesie) restroom  *Sushi pencils attached to plastic spoon? Do ppl really steal these? *Vinyl seats  It works for them. Cheap prices and great-tasting sushi. Avocados were a little overripe and lifeless. One of the rolls seemed kind of sloppy, but overall - great experience!   Loved the fact that the sushi chef himself came over and asked us how we were. Also thought it was sweet that the owner and his family were doing their Sunday family meal w one big rice cooker at their table! Very nice!  If you're looking for glitz and glam - it ain't gonna be here. This place is no frills and I'm a fan."}
{"text":"I have to say, my first venture into the amazing flavorbomb of Korean food was indeed an awesome one.   First off, this restaurant is the definition of \"hole in the wall\". Family run, the interiors are not very fancy ( unless you want to look at the entire menu in picture format), but really, the food shines.   While their sushi looked very impressive and terrible for you, we decided to go for the Korean food, as we have friends in South Korea who rave about the food all the time. She had the Bulgogi, and I had a Kimchi based soup that had tofu and beef in it, and both were awesome. The bulgogi had a lovely sweet flavor about it, that highlighted the flvor of the beef wonderfully. I could easily get addicted to it. My soup was amazingly hot & spicy, with large chunks of beef and tofu. It was warm and fulfilling, I assume it's the soul food of Korea.  Also, the side dishes. They laid out about 7 different side dishes, each of them delicious. They ranged from cold daikon, to some sort of zucchini encased in pancake.    As for the service, it was super personal, and amazing.   I will definitely be going back and trying the sushi, which could secure that final star."}
{"text":"This is easily my favorite Sushi place; they have a large assortment of authentic sushi and unique local favorites, and some of the best crab puffs I've ever tried. It's a small place, but it's never very crowded or over-done in anyway. It's great for a casual lunch, or a nice dinner and sushi. I recommend this place for anyone looking for great sushi, and not some over-the-top franchise."}
{"text":"Sushi is amazing service is great. They make you feel welcome, the atmosphere is great always comfortable. I go there every month.Never got sick. They are a small place but it really works for them! LOVE it and recommend it to everyone.!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite sushi place! Everything is always so good and everybody that works here is super nice. Some of my favorites are the sweet and sour roll and the lion roll. I have been eating here for years and will definitely continue to do so. :)"}
{"text":"I only eat sashimi and nigiri, so I can't comment on the rolls, but what I did have was not so good and rather overpriced.   The Miso soup was a salty mess without seaweed and tofu bits with the consistency of gravel. The green tea (tea bags, really???) was, well, cheap tea bag tea. The nigiri was okay, but the sashimi was simply awful: wrapped in lemon sliced (to hide the smell of old age?) and of microscopic size.  Last but not least, an overbearing waitress who wouldn't listen.   Not coming back!"}
{"text":"Food is okay, but pretty good service.I do love the deep fried ice cream though.As far as sushi goes it's okay, but not my first choice and I've had much better."}
{"text":"I've been eating at this restaurant for years.  When I started going here it was called the Japanese bowl and had different owners.  The menu under the new owners is much larger than it used to be and now includes a nice variety of Korean delights.   Every visit is friendly and welcoming and we were always treated as family.  I used to go with my family on a regular basis and they always remembered my son and his favorite order.  The sushi is some of the best in the valley and they have some varieties that I've never had anywhere else. The Korean menu is great and they have specialized \"bento\" boxes for lunch as well as full sized dishes for dinner.  The portions are good and we never left hungry. This is one of my regular dining pleasures."}
{"text":"Great food, service fast & efficient. Star was very good. Nice friendly place. Clean & nice people."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the sushi here! Good quality for the price (not too expensive but not grocery store sushi either) and the people are soo friendly. I always have a good experience at J.K. Sushi."}
{"text":"My husband, daughter and I have been going here for over a year, and absolutely love it.  Aside from everyone being so incredibly nice and attentive, the food here is just fantastic.  We initially came here for the sushi, but Chen talked us into trying one of the Korean bowls, and now we're addicted.  We have not had one bad meal here.  The prices are very reasonable, the restaurant super clean, service quick--couldn't ask for anything better.  They also have a couple of plasma tvs which are usually tuned to a sporting event, which my husband loves. Contrary to a previous review, we did not find the menu confusing at all--it was very organized and descriptive (which is very helpful for the special sushi rolls).   Highly highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Sushi restaurant or brothel?  I had lived basically across the street for 2 years and had seen this hole-in-the-wall joint, but had never been, despite sushi being my favorite food. I figured it was time I check it out - I went there around 4:30 on a Thursday, in time for happy hour, which is from 2-5.  I walk in and there's not a single customer in the restaurant, which wasn't a surprise considering I had never seen anyone walk in there.  The place looked somewhat run-down inside and especially on the outside.  I'm greeted by a cute asian girl who's sitting at a table on her laptop.  I ordered a couple rolls off the happy hour menu (#4 and #7) for $5 each. Both we're good, but I probably wouldn't pay their regular price of $8 for either.   More importantly, let's talk about how this place manages to stay open?    Facts: - They have been open for at least 2 years (they were here when I moved here 2 years ago).   - I've been in this strip mall many times and had never seen anyone walk in the doors of JK sushi. - There were at least 3 employees working - Not a single customer in the restaurant besides me - The cute Asian girl (mentioned above) had a \"get boned\" bumper sticker on her laptop.    My theory is they have something involving \"getting boned\" going on in the back.  If they don't have some other way of making money, I have no idea how they manage to stay profitable.  I don't think I'll be back unless I'm really curious one day and want to see if I can purchase some \"extras\" in the back."}
{"text":"We really liked this place, even though we found the sushi to be lacking. The sushi rice wasn't right for the rolls, and it kept falling apart, and it was kind of dry. The Fresh Roll had a dark sauce on top of it which we found extremely overwhelming. We only had 2 pieces of it and couldn't eat any more. The AZ roll was very dry and fell apart. Their CA roll was just fine though.   However, despite the sushi, their bento boxes were great. I had the Kalbi lunch box and the beef was perfect. My boyfriend had the sushi bento box and the nigri pieces were excellent. I also had the sashimi order, $10 for 6 pieces of sashimi is great pricing in my opinion. Unfortunately, we didn't get to choose the fish, it was just a set order of 2 tuna sashimi, 2 sake sashimi, and 2 white fish sashimi.   The wait staff there were really awesome though. They were polite, attentive and answered the questions we had. Overall, we will be back here for lunch some time in the future, we will just make sure to avoid the sushi and go for the bento boxes."}
{"text":"On point and affordable.  Crab angels and rainbow roll were amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! We eat here once a week and they never disappoint. There are so many options and types of rolls to choose from and you can't beat a $5 sake bomb or $5 happy hour rolls. JK sushi will continue to be a favorite with us and our friends."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick sushi meal or full dinner. We bring our family here often. Good quality food and competitive prices."}
{"text":"Arrived around 3:00 pm with husband and son.  Nice folks.  Awful food!  Really awful.  So sorry to say, but come on.  We always order a lot to try and lots of things. Crab angels were freezer burned and not crispy.  Sauce from bottle.  Salmon nigiri was okay.  Soy sauce labeled light, was definitely full sodium.  Salmon roll was mostly rice, with pencil circumference portion of salmon and the seaweed paper was chewy and horrid. The Las Vegas was the most hideous thing of an excuse for Las Vegas ever. I think that there was mix of old smoked salmon and carrots in there. It was definitely premade, and doused in dark, sweet sauce to try to hide what was going on in there. Spicy marinated pork Bulkigi was flappy and bland.  It was served with many \"sides\".  Some of them were OK some of them not. The kimchi was good but not what we know to be quality  kimchi.  Not fermented long enough. Portions were measly. Rice was too sticky and falling apart.  I think they may know that they are getting by with substandard overall food. They ARE really nice. But but we are not likely to ever return. Seems like this is most likely the way it is every day.  Not good for sushi - for sure."}
{"text":"I really hope we don't get food poisoning because the food was horrible. Everything tasted old. We had sushi and the rainbow roll. We also had beef bulgogi. The beef bulgogi had a weird taste and we always eat it at different restaurants. The side dishes were slimy from being old. The sushi was too fishy and super small portions. The service was great but horrible quality food. We will never come back and if I were you I would not come here. It's scary and I'm really hoping we don't get food poisoning!   Ps. It is RIDICULOUSLY expensive. For two people (and we don't eat a lot) the bill came out to $64. Worst sushi restaurant ever. Please don't come here."}
{"text":"Wow what a diamond in the rough ! The wife and I were in the area and in the mood for some sushi on a Sunday (the day when a lot of good sushi joints are closed) so we did a google search found it was open and decided to give it a chance.   Don't be fooled by the appearance upon walking in, it's obvious they tried to save costs in the decorations to up the quality of their food. Besides it seems to be a quaint family owned operation by people who know good sushi! Why waste money on funky lights right?   Long story short, the sushi and service was outstanding and reminded us a lot of Tokyo lobby before their move across the parking lot. Small place, big satisfaction !!! Definitely worth it and we'll be back again. I'm also looking forward to experiencing their happy hour too.  Oh and the people next to us were in there for third day in a row."}
{"text":"J.K. sushi must mean \"Just Kidding not Sushi\" I had to give this place 2  attempts and I have been progressively disappointed. The waitresses were fantastic, but it appears the owners of this place are taking every possible opportunity to cut costs and make this the worst sushi place in Arizona. Good luck finding anything on the roll menu without crab meat (the fake cheap stuff of course), I even found crab in their spicy tuna. If you ask for something spicy they will just dump siracha on top. Something as simple as fried rice or yaki soba looks like it would belong in an army dining facility. One would think that after you cut costs at every possible turn at least the bill would be cheap,  don't be fooled, it was as expensive as most places in Scottsdale. But hey, at least they are open on Sundays. Jiro has nightmares about this type of restaurant."}
{"text":"J.K. sushi?? Yeah because they are clearly a joke! How is this place still in business?!  California roll, shrimp tempura roll and egg rolls set me back $16 bucks! Worst sushi ever!! Old rice, stale, poorly assembled, not fresh and ugh, just so gross. I'll be amazed if I don't end up sick.   Omg, no... Just no."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! This little family owned sushi restaurant is the best I've been to in Arizona. I go here EVERY year for my birthday and my familys birthday's. They are so sweet and friendly, and make the most amazing sushi and soups and etc., you will ever try. So fresh and full of flavor, you can never go wrong no matter what you order. There is NEVER a wait its great especially if your hungry...you'll be rolling out once your done with this place ! :)"}
{"text":"I drive by this place everyday and decided to give it a try due to the good reviews. I called for a pick up order of Las Vegas rolls. I got home and started to eat them but they smelled/ tasted very sour! I began To pick them apart and eventually only ended up eating 3 of them. The next day I woke up with a rash on my legs that went all the way up to my elbows in red itchy patches! After going to the urgent care the doc narrowed it down to the bad sushi! I will never go back or recommend to anyone.   (2 Benadryls later I was ok)"}
{"text":"Wow fantastic sushi... i came from California and have been looking for a great sushi place. I decided to start of simple with avocado rolls and california rolls and they were amazing. Portions are perfect sizes. i will definitely go back and get suahi from this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE this place. We live in the neighborhood and got hungry while running some errands. JK looks a little sketch from the outside, and maybe even a little on the inside... But the amazing service and to die for sushi is what has made is regulars. Be sure to try the super shrimp tempura role!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a couple of times and love it. I'm surprise they are not more busy. maybe there is something to being the best kept secret!! I give them top marks"}
{"text":"Great little sushi & ramen place 5 mins from our house! It's a tiny little place in a strip mall, but everything we've had so far has been really good!"}
{"text":"Just another strip mall sushi place. Kind of run down looking inside and out. Sushi was on par with that from your grocery store but higher priced. Wait staff was horrible! Our waitress sat next to us and erased used menus and wore a t-shirt two sizes to small, exposing her butt cleavage. I regret not going to my regular sushi place. Either those who have reviewed this either haven't had real sushi or the business is writing their own reviews. I was not impressed and will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. Stopped in around 5 pm because it looked like a inexpensive spot that may have happy hour. There was no alcohol or happy hour. Sushi was decent, but the prices were RIDICULOUS. Way over priced for a strip mall sushi joint with FM radio and so so service. While I was eating a couple came in, looked at the menu, and walked out as the server actually chased them out the door to charge them for the soda they left untouched. I actually created this Yelp account just to warn people about this place."}
{"text":"Meh. Hardly anything but rice in the vegas roll. Crab puffs seemed store bought. The heart attack appetizer was the saving grace. Guess i will stick with my regular sushi place.."}
{"text":"Great North Phoenix hole-in-a-wall for sushi!  Love their caterpillar roll.  And, if you are daring try the Kentucky roll with tempura chicken."}
{"text":"Cute little place. Just had their yellowtail & eel nigiri. Very delicious - definitely will come back for my lunch breaks!"}
{"text":"First time getting take out from here. It was really good  and has nice friendly staff and is very clean in the inside. We will for sure order from here again :)"}
{"text":"It's not as busy in the morning but it does get busy in the evening! Their sushi is made fresh by a very kind man. This restaurant not only serves sushi but also korean food! To those that live close by and love a mix of Japanese and Korean food, are very lucky. I, for instance, don't get it that often and consider myself to be lucky. There is only one waitress that pretty much serves the food AND takes over the cash register. Although she has more than one position, she still manages to interact with her customers and treats them as they should be. She's very very nice and still continues to be. Besides staff, the food is made fresh!"}
{"text":"I love love love the sushi here and the staff is so nice. it has easily became one of my favorite sushi restaurants!"}
{"text":"After looking at the reviews for this place I thought I would give it a try. I have driven by and thought about it but always reconsidered. I wish I would have gone with my gut on that. This was probalby one of the worst sushi experiences ever! The food was bland the service was blah and I spent way too much for what we got. We asked what beers that had and she sais \"kirin\" so we ordered it. Then on the way to the bathroom we see a whole fridge with coors light. What BS!. I ever never tipped so poorly in my life but it was well deservered. Never go there it is a waste of money. Go with your gut on susho most of the time! If it looks like cr@@ it probably is. Oh yeah and my 7 year old thought the gyoza was made for a toddler. It was like MINI gyoza with no flavor."}
{"text":"I have lived near this place for 6 years and my favorite place is closed on Mondays, so we decided to give this a go.  I was really after chirashizushi and really, you can tell a lot about a sushi place by it's sashimi presentation.  First of all it was overpriced at 19.99.  I convinced myself that if it was good, it would be worth it.  There were 2 of us and normally, I would eat the chirashi by myself, but it also normally comes as 2 pieces of several varieties of fish and at least shrimp, ika and I was hoping for ikura.  This is the first time I have ordered chirashi and gotten it so far removed from it's Japanese way, that it is no longer chirashi.  The server couldn't pronounce it, when I asked her what was cut for it, I got an empty vague answer.  She had no idea.  The bowl looked like bibimbap (which is a wonderful thing, I love that, too.  but that's not what I ordered).  So, it was a stainless, covered bowl of rice.  (sans seasoning) , 2 bowls of lukewarm miso soup.  1 spicy tuna roll.  and this large bowl of cut green lettuce dressed in sesame oil, and topped with paper thin slices of salmon, tuna and snapper.  The lettuce was fresh, the sesame oil inappropriate and the whole thing was covered in sesame seeds.  And the 'chef' came to the table to instruct me to add the \"chirashi sauce\" to it.   I let him know that sauce might be for bibimbap.....and he lingered table side until I put some on my plate.    So, it was as disappointing as ordering a taco and getting a burger.   And my bill was $32.00, at lunch time with waters to drink!  There is nothing wrong with dishing whatever floats your boat, but it's not cool to use menu names that are misleading."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this little mom and pop sushi spot. The staff is always so friendly, the prices aren't bad and the food is awesome!"}
{"text":"Hubs and I used to frequent this place when we lived closer, but now that we have moved, it's rare for us to visit....but every time we visit, we are never disappointed.  We actually have never ordered sushi there but have come for the korean food.  Their kalbi is always meaty and flavorful.  We also order the mandu gook soup which is a dumpling soup with noodles and a delicious light broth.  Their \"free\" side dishes are always delightful, too.  My favorite are the fish cakes and potato cakes.  The little man for some reason, always loves to eat the soy bean sprouts.  We also will usually order the dolsot bibimbap - the korean fried rice in a stone pot.  Oh so delicious. Now I want to go there and eat some Korean food.  The service there is always awesome.  I think it's a brother/sister that work the front and the parents are the cooks.  But both siblings are super nice and always remember us even if it's been a long time since we've been back. Maybe someday I'll try the sushi if I'm not always craving the Korean food so much!"}
{"text":"I chose this place because the Korean barbecue restaurant that I really wanted to go to was too far at the moment but I was just pleased to be able to find some soon dubu aka soft tofu soup. Alas, the side dishes only offered a few basic add-ons (just sprouts and everything else pickled) and the \"seafood\" ingredients left a lot to be desired (can you imagine having to peel and eat one of those baby shrimps?!?) The service was great and the piece of sushi and eggrolls were alright. Not bad for a small strip mall joint."}
{"text":"I have tried many of the sushi places around the area, and this is by far my favorite. The rolls are delicious, and they never skimp on the toppings (if something says it has crunchies, I expect more than a sprinkle!). Dine in or Take out, our orders are always correct. My favorite are the handrolls, which are a cone made of seaweed, filled with rice, cucumber, and your choice of a few select proteins. If you dine in, they serve these in a special dish to hold the handrolls upright, instead of laying on the side.  If you have never been here before, definitely try it. You will wonder why you eat sushi anywhere else! If you like spicy foods, try the heart attack-trust me!"}
