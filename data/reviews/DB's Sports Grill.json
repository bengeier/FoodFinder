{"text":"DB's Sports Grill is under new management and I think you will love the new atmosphere with great food and cold drinks.  We also have the PAC 12 network for those that want to watch PAC 12 action!  Come check us out!"}
{"text":"They may have fixed their food and service now they need to work on the staff. OMG the gals are, for the lack of a better word, GROSS. 
I mean come in who's hiring them??"}
{"text":"Was not impressed at all with the overall  bar it is super bright they need to dim some of there lights down. Now to the food I ordered a burger so when the burger arrived it was served with regular lays potato chips, if you want fries they cost extra. Really? The burger had no flavor at all I feel like you can get a better burger with more flavor from jack in the box. Now to the beer it's a regular draft beer nothin special so I had the regular size it cost 5.00 a glass seemed to me a little over priced I would hate to see how much the mug cost."}
{"text":"Very unresponsive cold waitress unless you were a young guy... She did not smile much less barely even said a word.  Maybe some customer service training?  First and last time here."}
{"text":"By far one of the best sports bars I've been to.  Service was great and food was awesome. Not to mention there is not a bad seat in the house when watching any event. The owner was a stand up guy who goes over and beyond to make sure all his customers are satisfied.  I would definitely recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Great place to watch a game or fight! They have good deals and the food is great for bar food. Service was great from our first server however, after she left the girl who took over was not very good. She was rude and seemed annoyed when we asked for something. Besides that this place was a lot of fun! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed at all with the overall bar, first off they leave all the lights on they should dim a few of them down. The food was ok nothing special I personally felt like you can get a better burger at jack in the box that has more flavor, also the burger comes with regular lays potato chips so if you want fries they cost extra. Really? Then to the beer it's a beer nothing special but over priced 5.00 for a regular draft beer I hate to see what the mug cost."}
{"text":"Been going here for years. I've never eaten anything here that I didn't like. New ownership changed a couple of things I didn't necessarily care for: 1)I used to love the classic rock music and accompanying videos when nothing was really on in the sports world, 2) changed the meat on the loaded fries from chunks of steak to some sort of cheaper beef. But other than that, the food is good, the waitresses are nice, and the beer is cold. And the one good change from new ownership that I noticed was daily drink specials."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere, friendly staff and great service.  The owner Bubba introduced himself and made me feel welcomed.  Compared to many bars I've been to this placed is well staffed; I always have a full drink.  Try the deep fried pickles, they are really good!"}
{"text":"hamburger I ordered was the bbq burger, it was kinda plain no taste really except the bbq sauce.  The  fries were  kinda soft and not done.   Just a little seasoning would be great.   Beer was great though.   Friendly service."}
{"text":"I have yet to get a bad meal, or a messed up order from this place. Great food and staff, and yes Friday nights are PACKED, but with good reason... I mean, you don't get packed, or have return patrons time and time again if service and food is subpar.

Since under new management from the old \"Desert Babes\" last year, the owner has whipped this place into shape."}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon - not many people there, but that didn't make the service any better, We walked in and someone said \"Hi\", but who? The \"waitress\" was sitting at a table with some friends having a chat. We seated ourselves and a few minutes later she was able to tear herself from her chums and bring menus. A long wait - then she comes for a drink order. How long should it take to get a couple of bottled beers? 10 minutes is ridiculous. Then we place a food order. Took way too long to get. While waiting made the mistake of using the guys restroom. Filthy, gross, smelly. It needs to be cleaned  - every square inch - with generous amounts of Clorox, checked hourly, and cleaned constantly. No excuses. The food was ok. Hamburger well done and tasty as was my partners. But the management really needs to address the wait staff and get a more professional level and they must do something immediately about the cleanliness.  A shame, too. Right next to a new hotel with another coming in soon and people need a nice place to go - but DB's isn't a nice place. Clean it up!"}
{"text":"Ok place to drink, but don't expect much for food. Had the wings, worst to date! I ordered them medium flavored, and extra crispy. They had no flavor, and were undercooked and rubbery."}
{"text":"This place has done a complete 180! Bubba is doing a great job of making the customers feel important and trying hard to get more people in the door. The specials are great and I look forward to any other changes management has in place. 

I've heard talks of shuffleboard :)"}
{"text":"So... I have given this place another chance since my last review was quite awhile ago. I figured \"ok, since I've seen all these bad reviews, this place must have changed a few things\"... NOPE... My wife and I arrived during happy hour and it was moderately busy. I entered the double doors, looked around and saw what I thought to be prime real estate next to the back/kitchen/point of sale machine. My wife and I parked our butts right there to ensure we would be seen and have prompt service (I attached a photo that shows our location). At first the waitress greeted is within 3 minutes of us sitting down, we ordered our drinks and got them about 7 minutes later. Needless to say, I was all smiles at this point because I thought to myself \"YASSS! This will be a great visit and they've changed their lack luster methods\". I am sad to report that this was NOT the case. Once we received our beers, the waitress supplied menus, however, she never returned. My wife and I sat there patient for over 20 minutes all while the OWNER (previously introduced at our last visit) walked by us multiple times and the waitress as well walked by us Over and over... At several points the waitress parked herself at the bar to shoot the breeze with her co-workers and never even gave us a second look. My wife and I were able to finally get the check, we paid and we went to a different sports bar down the road. 

 I'm definitely shocked at the conduct displayed by this place... One has to ask... Does the owner even look at the reviews about his bar?? You'd think that he would to ensure a future. Anywho... This is the second visit in about 6 months and it was super disappointing. I don't recommend this place and must advise to enter at your own RISK.

 All in all the visit was pleasantly disappointing... The pleasant part was my wife, no matter where I go, if she's with me, I'm a happy guy. 

 I'm not trying to be nit picky, but an FYI, their beer tastes as if their taps/lines are dirty. My family owned multiple sports bars and I have a taste for beer that's been run through dirty tap lines and the lines at this bar are dirty. 

 Note to owner: Please, kind sir, can you have a training sesh to supply your team with the proper skills to ensure your guests have a good time at your establishment."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp trying to find decent late night dinner. Called first and woman on the phone was very friendly! Stopped in @10:30pm on a Tuesday and received great service, great food and an awesome crown and seven! It was my first time and CiCi the bartender recommended the burger and she was spot on. 1/2 lb. burger cooked to your liking. It was juicy, well cooked and flavorful. The owner, Bubba was very amiable. I will be back. Oh did I mention that my perfectly cooked juicy 1/2 lb burger was only $5.00 during happy hour at 10:30pm. Yes!!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time with this joint.  First if the bitches that they have working there deem you worthy to wait on you don't expect the service to be speedy or friendly.  I had the misfortune of going there to meet some friends their suggestion.   After finally getting noticed by the wait staff we ordered drinks and food.  Nature called so I went to the restroom only to find a guy puking  in the toilet.  He said don't get the wings!  Dang that is what I ordered .  After returning to the table the drinks showed up maybe 15 minutes after ordering them.  After another long wait and looking at our empty beer glasses our food showed up.  My wings were placed in front of me and I thought what the heck the guy throwing up in the restroom may have had something else that upset his stomach so I selected one to taste only to find my Hot wings were really cold wings with hot sauce poured on them.  Needles to say I did not eat them.  I paid for my beer and got the hell out of that Tomane tavern as fast as I could.  My friends were not far behind me.

Needless to say I would have given this place no stars if that was an option.  This place sucks there are much better sports bars in the area to go to.  I highly suggest not going here."}
{"text":"Found this place accidentally. I was out looking for a good bar when I happened to see the sign off of Higley and the 60. There were a few guys outside on the patio, and several people inside. This is a sports bar, so there are TVs everywhere and a pool table. I went to the bar and ordered a Rum and Coke and a plate of sliders. Both were awesome and since it was Happy Hour the prices were even better.
I met the owner, Bubba and we talked for a while. He is a very nice, endearing guy. 
He wants his customers to let him know what can be improved or what you like about the place. He's owned it now for about 4 months. 
I'm going back for sure."}
{"text":"Cold beer, tons of games on the TV's. I had Kristi as my bartender. She was helpful, friendly and quick. I asked what was good, she said the toasted sandwiches were a hit. I wanted hot wings, and she walked me thru the choices. I ordered wings, they arrived quick, and cooked to perfection. I ordered the toasted meat ball sandwich..... It was amazing! I am not kidding, this was a delicious sandwich. The bread was fresh, and delicious. The wings were hot and tasty. The San Tan Pale Ale was very fresh and tasty. Kristi was very friendly and helpful. It makes me sad there are no more of these, because there needs to be more. Kristi the bartender was a huge factor in my great experience"}
