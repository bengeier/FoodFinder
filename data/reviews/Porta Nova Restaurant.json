{"text":"Was at Porta Nova a few days ago and really enjoyed the food. The waitress was very friendly and attentive. The prices are very reasonable for the quality. I would definitely go back again. Great to have a restaurant like this in my community."}
{"text":"Came here for a Birthday party on the second floor. Great service, friendly waitresses and very reasonable prices. We ordered bunch of apps which were okay but the entrees were amazing. Half of us had francesinha, which was huge and tasted amazing. Rest of the party got bife a casa which they said was good too. I would definitely come back here. Muito Obrigado!"}
{"text":"Honesty one of my favourite Portuguese restaurants in the city. Been here so many times. Was introduced by some friends, never left here without being satisfied. Great work from Manuel!"}
{"text":"MY SIMPLE REQUEST TO THIS RESTAURANT:  \"Please email me a menu with your prices. Many thanks, Ned L.\"  THE RESTAURANTS REPLY: \"Good evening, thank you for your request, however, we do not have our menu pricing on our webpage nor do we email that information because it might change at any time. We apologize for the inconvenience this may have caused you.   Best regards Yvonne \"  MY REPLY:  Nuts...are your prices secret ?....If so, I'm sure Trip Advisor and Yelp, Dine Rewards, etc. would love to know... Most reputable restaurants give their pricing on request if not already on their website... even if their prices \"might change at any time\"...or perhaps you should go on the Stock Exchange and have minute by minute pricing... Please forward my email to your business's owner...before  I go public with your email... Yours,  Ned L"}
