{"text":"If you find yourself in this neighborhood by Queen and Parliament, there isn't much in the way of a decent meal, except the Berkeley Cafe. Great sandwiches, vegetarian options, chewy bread and seeds and stuff in the salads.  They keep weird hours though, there's been a lot of times that I'v passed by and it's been closed in the middle of the day, so it's not really the kind of place you can rely on."}
{"text":"I work really close so Berkeley is my regular haunt for my morning coffee. I love the staff - everyone is super nice. I should save money and bring my own lunch more often but the sandwiches at the Berk are so good I rarely do.   If you're in the area I highly recommend getting on their email list for daily specials. Also try the chicken, bacon, avocado and brie sandwich - it's to die for!"}
{"text":"Dear Ms. Owner of the Berkeley Cafe, how do you stay in business with your prices so low????  I wonder about this question every time I step foot into this place.  It's one of the only places even remotely close to the Distillery where you won't go bankrupt paying for your lunch.  Hence why everyone in the 'hood refers to it simply as Cheap Cafe.    If you're looking for ambiance or something hip & trendy, this is not your spot.  The cafe resembles....well.... a high school cafeteria but that doesn't take away from the rating here because there are just too many good aspects of this tiny little gem to let something like decor bring it down.   The food is always fresh, the owner is a lovely lady who mans the till (and has actually apologized for raising lunch special prices by $.25!) and there are Mon-Fri specials offered for, get this, $4!  Tuesdays are my fav with chicken and rice on the menu.  With prices like this, I have to actually debate with myself over the benefits of packing a lunch.    Should you show up in the lunch rush, expect a line but not to worry, everyone knows what they want and the staff are efficient so the line moves super quick!  I've withheld the final star only because of the service hours.  If you don't get in there before 3pm, you'll find the doors locked."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! They have been in the hood for as long as i can remember. The owner and her daughter are  seriously cool... to be honest im kinda of jealous wish she was my mom !!! Also they hire total babes that are down to earth.   The food is always on par. My favourite sandwich is the vegetarian option with avocados etc on a baguette. Love their Salmon Nicoise.  It opens early and closes early so make sure you get there before 3pm."}
{"text":"I love The Berkeley Cafe! For the many times I've been here, I have only ever had the Salmon Wrap because it is delicious! The wrap consists of a large piece of salmon, arugula, red onion, feta cheese, and tomatoes with sun-dried tomato aioli. It comes with a soup or salad - I always get the daily soup, and although it is always delicious, I find the soups tend to be a little salty for my taste. (But keep in mind, I am super picky about eating soups from restaurants as I am iffy about sodium content.) All this for - I think - $9? Totally worth it; definitely the best deal for lunch around.  The space is small though, so try to come here before or after the lunch hour rush. Or get your food to go! When it's nice out, there is a small patio open, which is nice. The waitresses here are super friendly :)   When you eat here, you leave feeling good, not fat or bloated, which is a huge plus when you have to get through another half day of work."}
{"text":"I used to eat here EVERY day when I worked at CanStage. It was terrible that I didn't pack lunch more often, but the prices here are so good, it's almost cheaper to eat here than grocery shop for lunches!!!  I think that's their clientele, which is why they're only open from early morning until about 5 p.m.  This is NOT a place to stay and eat. There are a few tiny little tables, but the CONSTANT line-up means a constant din. Grab and go! Or eat outside if it's nice. They have a bunch of stone/marble picnic tables.  Though, I must point out at this point, there really is a CONSTANT line-up. This is always a good sign. And believe me, that line-up moves QUICKLY, man!!! Soup nazi style! Only the staff here are all sweethearts. They are all just friendly, funny people who work hard to feed a TON of people every day with home-cooked, freshly made meals.   There are 3 or 4 hot specials every day, as well as made-to-order sandwiches of any type you desire. There are chips, fruit, salads and soups as well as baked goods like muffins and cookies to snack on as well.  GREAT place to grab a quick bite or lunch during the day! FAB prices!"}
{"text":"I met a friend for lunch that works in the building next door today and we came in to eat. The food was phenomenal!!! I had a cup of the day's soup and a salmon wrap. Taste, presentation, quality, and price = All fantastic! I'll be in Toronto again on Thursday and am already planning to go back for lunch then."}
{"text":"Gearing up for our annual event finds me on the corner of Berkeley & Queen again this spring and so we dash into the Berkeley Cafe for a bite of lunch and some respite from a long morning of meetings. My affection factor the BC has jumped a star and I've decided that as small and limited in their hours, this is just about one of my most favorite lunch spots in the city.   It's not cluttered with bric-a-brac like so many other garage sale decorated cafes that have popped up all over the city. There are no funky smells from old chairs and sofas and there are no greasy dust strings across old lighting fixtures. Is it a busy spot, yup, it is. A constant stream of coming and going for takeout, which in my opinion, tells you this is a place that makes decent food.   The soup of the day was a Mexican spicy chipotle lentil soup. I asked about getting it in a takeout container because I can never eat all this food in one sitting. The waitress suggests I order just a cup size. I jump at this suggestion and this soup was damn delicious, almost coming across like lentil stew. My lunch mate took one look at my soup and promptly ordered up one for herself. I ordered an egg salad sandwich with a side salad. This was simply one of the best egg salad sandwiches I've ever had in a cafe. Red onion, fresh dill, lots of arugula and bean sprouts on super fresh whole grain bread. The side salad was pretty, bright and screamed fresh, fresh, fresh. Grated carrots, beets, big chunks of crunchy red peppers, spanish onions and cukes atop a bed of spring mix with a light, tangy vinaigrette.   My lunch buddy ordered up a spicy grilled chicken salad topped with feta and dressed with a lemony vinaigrette. In addition to this I had an Americano at the end of my meal. The bill total came to a whopping $15.40 for both us together. Best lunch bargain we've had in ages. Check out the pics. The Berkeley Cafe is one of my most fave lunch destinations and considering I'll be in that neighbourhood for the next few months I'm grateful that they are there! Fresh, delicious food and easy on the pocketbook. Thank you BC!"}
{"text":"I had a delicious grilled chicken sandwich (avacado, brie, tomatoes) today with a cappuccino for lunch. The sandwich was really good, the cappuccino was veering on the bitter side with less aroma than expected, but the atmosphere here is definitely one of the greatest draws for the place.  This teeny tiny places has two red curtains the hides the place as you walk in the door, making you feel like you're walking into some kind of stage. Inside is small, cute, and cozy, perhaps fitting no more than 10-12 patrons at a time. A lot of people come to get things to go. We arrived at 11:50am and there were only one other table occupied. As we approached 12:30, the place became packed.   Price-wise, the place isn't cheap. 8-9 dollars for a sandwich. I did have an enjoyable time here and it's definitely a great place for people who work in the area to stop by for lunch."}
