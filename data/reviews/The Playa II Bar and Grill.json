{"text":"Hey, disregard the one star talk around the playa. This is a neighborhood establishment and it has allll my respect. It has a funky beach theme (hula skirts everywhere), jukebox and pool table, and big TVs to watch the sports. Go sports!

I really enjoy this place because the staff is very friendly and the beer is cheap. Also I can't get in and out of this place without running into someone I know from the neighborhood...and that's a great neighborhood bar trait! Also they have lots of food for your 1 AM snacking needs."}
{"text":"This seems to be a pretty cool place to hang out
The decor is cool
The people seem to be friendly 
Prices aren't too bad
I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Smells nasty. Free breakfast on Sunday. Not worth the trip"}
{"text":"I am sooo glad that I paid no attention to those negative reviews from 2011!!!  

First off I smelled nothing off kilter whatsoever (and being OCD I would know). Please put that out of your mind right now.  Nor did I see anything I would associate with \"trailer trash\" whatever the heck that is supposed to mean, it sounds rather mean-spirited to me so will just ask that you to please put it out of your mind. 

This is a local establishment with a history to it. It deserves respect and to me in one visit has definitely earned respect. I love the place. 

Momma, the owner, and everyone I met there is *amazing*.  Everyone is so friendly, polite, courteous, great sense(s) of humor- wonderful eclectic mix of music (covers most tastes-I was unable to locate the source but suspect jukebox). They watch out for each other as one would in a family type of atmosphere, which is what this felt like...  

Why hasn't the food been mentioned?!?

OMGeez!!!  I haven't eaten this much in eons!!!  Everything is made fresh!  My friend and I had the fish tacos with cole slaw and homemade potato chips.  To die for!!!  The cod was delightful and FRESH.  In fish tacos the fish is so rarely this fresh, succulent and NOT battered to death or at all oily or greasy. It was simply in a word...delicious. (Sorry Mama that I was unable to come up with a better singular adjective, I'll work on it!)

Tucked back from the road a bit, which to me adds to its charm.  Parking is good. Great happy hour specials. 

I've heard they've got a killer Bloody Mary and free breakfast on Sunday morning so will have to try to make it up and out to review that...  

Definitely give this place a try!  I will be here again that's for sure...  Enjoy!  Casual attire (stilettos not required, I left mine at home).

I do need to find out more about this band I have heard that apparently plays here at times called \"narcoleptic spiders\"... I saw that online but forgot to ask about it. (Doh!) Oh and I read online that they've got open mic nights too though I wasn't there for it...  

Namaste'"}
{"text":"I don't know what Dave S.'s problem is, but The Playa II is a very homey, comfortable neighborhood bar.  I am not trailer trash - major eastern city symphony orchestra musician with degrees who stumbled upon Phoenix when retiring - but I enjoy hanging out here in a friendly environment with Mama Sharen running the show. The kitchen is VERY good and very reasonable. Italian night on Wednesday is one of our favorites. Hamburgers are very good. Great drink specials. This is not a Scottsdale phony place - give it a try."}
{"text":"We have come here before and have had wonderful service. We came in for our second time a few nights ago and I was hugely disappointed. I had looked at their drink menu and saw one of my favorite drinks (a mudslide) and couldn't wait to do it. When my friend went to order the bar tender claimed to not have either of the drinks we wanted. My friend came back to the table to grab the menu and show her that you do in fact have those drinks. Realizing so, she then asked if I wanted my mudslide as a martini or on poured over ice...well then...last time I checked mudslides are a frozen drink, like a frozen margarita. But she explained that's not a choice which once again said frozen on the menu. I still ordered it and to say the least tasted good still. But I don't think she knew her menu, bar, or her job very well.  I wish her the best of luck with future guest. My friend loves this bar so we will be back but hopefully the next time I am there the bartender will be more knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Here is a photo taken today of the ice well. I pointed this out to the waitress and she said there is nothing I can do about it and kept serving drinks with this moldy ice.. This is very dangerous to your customers and a serious health code violation."}
{"text":"I love this local bar in my 'hood.  It's a casual dive bar with friendly staff.  The bartenders are great -- they are attentive, funny, and all very nice.  There are pool tables and video games.  They have open mic nights (I think Tuesdays), poker nights, and sports.  They have drink specials every day.  On Sunday morning, they serve complimentary breakfast with the purchase of a beverage (and it's yummy)!  If you're looking for a local bar where you can just hang out and have a good time, Playa is it!"}
{"text":"By far one of the best neighborhood bars I have gone to, plus it has a kitchen with  a very good menu. The bar tenders are quick with a smile and your drink . The food is so good , people working at a restaurant next door come there to eat. there is a good sound system for music, plenty of tv's for sports, pool tables, darts,and pin ball machines. The patrons there are friendly and I just love the beach decor [ it reminds me of where i would love to be, being we are in the desert ].Good atmosphere and good company. Can't beat it. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Trailer trash Phoenix now have a home! This place smells of urine but of which the aroma candles that are burning cannot cover. The locals with no taste in music, the songlist is all over the place with no sense of direction. Bare and lacking, the decor is in major need of the Fab 5 from NYC. I'm sorta afraid of even trying the food. Beach theme in the middle of the desert? Get the picture. Someone mentioned an Open Mike Night, but not gonna stick around here, I'm too afraid of what I'll see. Too many people wearing sweat pants for my like, and the woman next to me at the bar is using a hand stapler that the barkeep loaned out so she could 'fix' her shoe!?!?
Did I mention the drinks are dirt cheap?"}
{"text":"I love the Playa. I love the owner. I really love the bartender Lauren. I love the bartender Joe. I love a good cocktail. I love neighborhood bars you inevitably will run in to someone you know. I love North Phoenix!!! 
You can trust me, I'm in the business ;D"}
{"text":"I'm giving 5 stars comparing to other neighborhood bars. I really like coming here great deals during football games. Tonight is $2 well drinks and a cerviche tostada with chicken fideo soup for $6. The waitress/bartenders are really friendly. It's clean, not too dark. The food is good bar food. Saturday's they have a great fried chicken dinner. Don't be put off by the creepy and loser comments. It's a really nice neighborhood bar. Lots of singles and couples. Everyone is welcomed and I wouldn't be afraid to come as a single woman."}
{"text":"Great place for cheap drinks! 
Everybody knows each other and you can becom part of the Playa family quick :)
Sharen ( the owner ) is very friendly and nice and she will remember your name and what you drink after one visit.

Great place to watch games !"}
{"text":"With football season just around the corner you need to find a place to watch your team & this place is great! Free breakfast and all the games on sunday. Very chill and you can even hear your game, plus the bartenders know how to pour a drink & are easy on the eyes. A+"}
{"text":"Great local bar. Missy; Lisa; Fernanda and Bree are great bartenders. Very personable and professional. They make some of the best bloody Mary's but please ask for them at an appropriate time! 

Sharen the owner has created a great business and for the last 5 years I have made some great friends up here."}
{"text":"Every neighborhood should have a tiki/beach themed dive located in the non-descript strip mall on the corner.

A locals place for sure, but as an out of towner I felt totally comfortable here knocking back a few brews and shooting a few games of pool.

2 beers were only $5.50 (I think)."}
{"text":"Love this place! Momma (The Owner) is the most amazing woman you could ever meet. She always has the best interest for all of we customers. They have poker some nights and breakfast for free at 9am on Sundays. Great place to watch football, play pool or hang out with you friends from the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The owner Sharon and her husband are two of the best people a person could meet. They open their arms for every patron that walks through the door. The motif and atmosphere are relaxing. There is a wide variety of people who enjoy being there. It's like a family. The deep fried tacos are amazing."}
{"text":"I'm now a repeat customer after trying this at the recommendation of a coworker. It isn't pretty outside but once inside it is neat and clean, beachy themed as the name would have you believe. I have tried the fried tacos, and the wings. The fried tacos are like jack in the box tacos but better. They are perfect to go with a beer. The wings are bigger than most wing places which is great because they are priced well. There are wing specials and trivia on Tuesday nights. The locals are welcoming. It has a true neighborhood feel. I'd prefer that there was no smoking by the front door as it makes the food unappetizing, especially when they prop open the door. I've had no problems with the service here. They are always friendly and attentive.

The bathrooms are like super cute beach stalls and they are always clean. 

Try to catch dueling piano night!"}
{"text":"Worst service EVER!!!!!!!
Never came back to ask if we wanted to Oder anything.   Short staffed.  Seems like you only get service if you are a regular which apparently they don't want any new ones. So sorry but bye bye"}
{"text":"The Playa was a dive bar that I ended up meeting a friend at one night because his friend lived up in this area. The bar was pretty large but the crowd was just like you'd expect at a dive bar. I got two beers and didn't stay very long but they seemed to do decent business. They operate much different than bars I've been in. They had a refrigerator like you'd see in a kitchen right behind the bar and the prices just seemed to be throw at random from the bartenders. This is not a place I would choose to visit myself."}
{"text":"So glad my co-worker and I went and checked this place out before we did Friday happy hour with our 15 co-workers!

Bartender did not greet us even though all of the men at the bar turned to look...sure she saw us.  we sat down read the menu 3x.  Long day at work and the last thing I wanted to do was hunt down a beer.

We waited around for 15 min at a table and left.  We then walked 20 yards to Uncle Sam's and had beer in hand in within 5 min.

I am so disappointed!  I was excited to bring my co-workers to a new place \"for us\" that has fish tacos.

Unfortunately we did not even have the chance to try anything other than the service.  Not a chance in hell I would take/ask my coworkers to this place.  I would have been mortified if 15 of my friends came
 in and were ignored on my recommendation.

Sucks cause it looked so
Fun until u couldn't get a beer!"}
{"text":"What a great find for locals!! Pool tables, a lounge area, great drinks...but the best part...Hands Down...is the attentive and expeditious service of the staff, particularly Whitney, Fernanda, and Bri! Two thumbs up! Definitely recommend. I will gladly play you in a friendly game of pool!"}
{"text":"This bar is what it is. I love it but it's not going to overwhelm you with the ambience or the food. Everything is average which is ok because it's considered a dive bar. All good in the hood."}
{"text":"La Playa is a quaint dive bar that recently got a makeover. Its glass walls were painted black which made for interesting summer visits. But now it attempts to have a beach motif, complete with a faux great white shark head biting an Arizona license plate and puffer fish. 

It offers two pool tables, an electronic dart board and a pinball machine or two. Nothing remarkable there. It is well lit which coincides with its new attitude. There is also a digital jukebox and few pay-to-play digital game consoles at the end of the bar. 

I have yet to eat the food. Honestly I will not likely try it. 

There are a few pool/lawn plastic seats to sit on outside. They have some small plastic bins for garbage and cigarette refuse.

But the drinks are great and the prices cannot be beat. There is a very gorgeous bartender there sometimes. She is actually worth the trip. She makes a great root beer shot. None of the other customers seemed dismayed that there is no (none that I saw anyway) wine. Overall a pleasant drinking experience."}
{"text":"Right near my new house, so I got very excited, but it's impossible to get a drink in there unless they know you.
Moving on."}
