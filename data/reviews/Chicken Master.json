{"text":"The food was good. Mine came hot and fresh. They did sub the rice for a large fries, had fresh buns, well done wings and a nice char on the chicken. 
They did forget the dipping sauce, and the fries came extra soggy, but I'd def order from here again. 
It's a great option when looking or chicken different from Swiss chalet. They use BBQ sauce and a BBQ char. 
It was a nice meal over all."}
{"text":"Arguably the best wings in Brampton.  Go here every few weeks. The service is friendly and prompt.  Wings are great! I always get medium sauce (perfect blend of sauce and spice). Chicken and fries are good too.  One tip, pick up your order. Call ahead and pick it up, they usually give an estimated time it will be ready.  Tuesday and Wednesday get 40 wings for under 30 bucks!! (Buy 30 get 10 free special)"}
{"text":"Just (delivery) ordered a donair with sweet sauce and some buffalo chicken pieces (like wings with no bones). Both items were delicious. Will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"Was looking for a new wings restaurant. I searched and found this place. Was not disappointed.  It's my new favorite. Hope they're around for a while."}
{"text":"If you're craving wings this is THE place you need to call! Good size wings, super friendly staff and decently priced. We will eat their wings and only their wings! They truly are the Masters of Chicken joints"}
{"text":"I will never order from here again the food was cold did not get my hole order and the driver never has the right change he had to go get change sorry but I was not giving a 10 tip"}
{"text":"Although I am not a huge fan of wings sometimes I like to have some.  Recently moving into a new area in Brampton has expanded my choices in many types of food.  Chicken Master stood out to me as I was searching for places to buy wings.  Its crazy seeing how much some restaurants charge for wings.  Chicken Master had a great deal.  50 wings for $42.95.  That's not a bad deal at all.  We ordered the 50 wings and a large order of fries.  The wings were ordered half honey garlic and half sweet chili.  The wings were a bit small and there was way to much sauce at the bottom of the container but none the less the wings were very tasty and cooked perfectly.  The fries were a bit soggy by the time I brought them home but that usually happens when you don't eat fries right away.  The only thing I do wish was that being a chicken place they could have had more selection in sauces for the wings.

I will be back especially after seeing their full menu.  The menu is extensive.  Chicken, Ribs, Sandwiches, Burgers, dinners..... too much to list."}
{"text":"DO NOT BE FOOLED by the good reviews here, I am SURE they are written by the owners or staff.

The chicken here is terrible. I ordered a family meal ($60+) and was so very disappointed. The chicken was too oily, and the fries were dry. I ordered two philly cheese steak sandwiches on the side and they came on HOT DOG BUNS!!! It had melted CHEDDAR cheese and did not resemble philly cheese steak even remotely!

I have no idea why people are rating this place high. They must be high."}
{"text":"Wings are good, but small. Would have preferred bigger wings, although, the chicken itself was great. The service was good, and fast and he gave us an extra four wings."}
{"text":"I moved to Brampton about a year ago.  Food scene in Brampton is lacking, but I've come across a few gems.  This place in particular has become a regular go to spot for chicken.  Their pickup special (whole chicken and fries) feeds 2 and gives leftovers for under $20.00.  Chicken is well grilled and sauced.  Excellent value and quality.  I can't give a 5 star rating as some of the other menu items I've tried have been mediocre, but these guys do chicken and they do it well."}
{"text":"We placed a pick up order over the phone, when we arrived it was ready. Each order had 2 extra wings and were very saucey. The fries and gravy are ok but I would definitely recommend the wings."}
{"text":"Really good chicken.. prefer this than wild wings or any other wings place. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a chicken spot."}
{"text":"The original chicken masters sandwich, is a must try! The fries are typical.. the Tiziki sauce was runny.. which I don't like, but it was flavorful, so I can't complain. I would definitely order from here again, the reason for the 3 stars is because it's just a typical restaurant with good burgers and fries and sandwiches but I've had better. Not bad, I do recommend you try it at least once. The cheese cake is good :)"}
