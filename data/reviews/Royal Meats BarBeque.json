{"text":"Good food and atmosphere. Definitely try the chavaps. The pork and veal was really good. They also have a nice patio. Parking is also available."}
{"text":"In my 36 years on Earth, my night here ranks as one of the worst eating experiences I've ever had. I don't know if this is \"authentic\" food, but I hope there isn't a nationality out there that wants to claim as its own a leathery, deeply chewy tube of greyish meat wrapped around a pound of lumpy cheese separated into chunks and oil. When I eventually managed to cut through the meat, the contents spilled out onto my plate like a huge puddle of bad life choices made solid. That this \"restaurant\" serves pre-frozen items manufactured somewhere else comes as absolutely no surprise. 

It's hard to screw up fries. The only real way is to leave them for a while in the heater before serving them to a guest. I mean, when the majority of your foods are deep-fried, you would think that they would at least deep-fry them to order. 

And on top of all of this, the manager spent about five minutes berating an uncomfortable-looking waitress about ten feet from our table. Super-successful managing! You sure put that poor lady in her place IN PUBLIC, as all good businesses do."}
{"text":"Visited Royal Meats during their soft opening.  The service was excellent.  The portion sizes are great for the price and the food is very good."}
{"text":"Went tonight to try this place out as my husband and brother in law were craving meat and meat they got! The cevape were very tasty and the lipnya bread wasn't greasy. If you've been to Croatia, Bosnia or Serbia the food would be very familiar. The portions were worth the money and we all left stuffed. Casual place to get a drink and eat dinner. We will be back to pick up some fresh cevape for BBQ. We also had some crepes and they reminded me of my moms cooking, Nutella and banana was soooo good! 
Great place and worth the visit."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and very well priced. I had beef and veal chevaps, it was delicious. my Dad and husband had the steak sandwich, it really good as well. Would definitely recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Concept for this restaurant is serving variety of good cut meats. Almost like butcher shop in the back. But unfortunately they don't have steaks like Filet mignon or different size of steaks. And mine was chewy. But good size of side salad and love French fries.
Why am I giving 4 stars?
Service was great and sangria was excellent.
I may not try steaks again but more to offer and good vibes"}
{"text":"Yuck. 

Frozen burger disc. Frozen fries. 

Lousy service by a bearded hipster calling me \"mate\" , when he finally stopped chatting at the bar and took and delivered my order.  

Sliced dill pickles on the burger were great so they earned the one star!"}
{"text":"It is a cool concept.  I went there with family and friends and we had a great meal.  Some of my friends are from Croatia so I know that the food was prepared authentically.  Location is good, but would like to see an outdoor patio....probably not possible tho."}
{"text":"Disappointed...You would thinks a place that has \"Meats\" in their name would pay special attention to the quality of their meats...Wrong. I ordered a steak sandwich, and honestly, it was the WORST steak sandwich I have had in my life. I don't know what was worse, the fat or the grizzle...
Yes, the portion was fine but that was about it. It took about 2 years for this location to open but if they don't improve the quality of the food here, it will probably close a lot sooner.  I definitely won't be giving this place a second chance..."}
