{"text":"OK, I have been here before and loved the food, and my daughter adores this place as well. I was a little hesitant because there was a review posted that made me uneasy, I am Caucasian and my daughter is bi-racial. I have been in places where both she and i had been discriminated against and it is hurtful. I will say when i came in here today, i was immediately greeted by Jasmin (?) I hope I got her name right. She was so helpful and took our orders right away. I had a restaurant.com certificate and i wanted chicken and waffles (my daughter loves Roscoe's in Pasadena and I wanted her to have them here). Jasmin suggested we get the chicken and waffles and in order to utilize the value of the certificate she recommended the smothered chicken as a to-go order. The food was brought out fresh, hot and delicious. No attitude by anyone that I was aware of, if anything, they were uber attentive. She even got us our drinks to go. Nice touch. All the food (and there was a LOT) was so delicious. I will definitely be coming back more often. everyone has an \"off\" day and poor service and rudeness are inexcusable, but I am happy to say that M&M treated me and my daughter like family. I can't wait to try the chitterlings next time.."}
{"text":"We stopped in to try this restaurant based on the Yelp reviews and are we glad we did!  The food was delicious!!!  We ordered the fried chicken (crispy and delish) and the short ribs (falling apart & sooo tender).  For the sides:  fried okra, collard greens, cornbread stuffing, yams, red beans & rice, mac & cheese.  The portions were generous.  We ordered a peach cobbler to go and enjoyed it on the way back to LA.  I highly recommend this place...you have to try it!"}
{"text":"Everyone is so friendly. It was our first time here but I feel like we are regulars. ..smothered oxtail is just as tender and savory just like at home.   Definitely coming back here with kids...for them to experience real soul food."}
{"text":"My husband and I eat here everytime we are in Vegas. The service is exceptional!  The food is super tasty. I have never had a bad experience with the food or service.  The folks here are quite pleasant and personable. They try their best to accomodate."}
{"text":"Amazing gumbo and great customer service toniesha was or server and boy was she great I asked for cold water to go and before I could walk back in the place after I forgot she was bring the water to me now that's great service and keeping her customer in mind I have not had great service in a long time but thanks to her I did experience it"}
{"text":"I'm from down South and I can tell you this restaurant serves some of the best soul food I have had period!  The portions are perfect.  The staff were all very attentive and extremely professional!  

I was absolutely stuffed.  I had the fried okra, rice and gravy, macaroni and cheese, and yams...so good!!!  And please don't get me started on their signature corn cakes, absolutely delicious!  We also had the fried chicken, pork chops, ox tails and gumbo and could not get enough!

I definitely recommend going to M&Ms when you're in town.  The owner is amazing and will make sure that you feel right at home."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews I tried this place while I was in Vegas last weekend.I went to the one on Las Vegas Blvd ,the service was so slow,not enough staff,the servers were exhausted and couldn't keep up.Alot of food kept getting return because the cooks would just throw something together. I am from the South and the food we received didn't have that touch to it....even the mac n cheese wasn't home made. I think we caught them on a bad day. It was an older lady doing her best to make sure people got the correct stuff,she was really nice ."}
{"text":"Just finished my meal here at M&M.  Solid, authentic and simply comforting food.  The free corn bread pankcake was fluffy and buttery.  Juicy fried dark meat chicken with gravy is to die for, pairing with yam and waffle is heavenly!  Great price, big portion, friendly service, and one of the best soul food I ever had.  We will make this a regular stop whenever we come back to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Best fried chicken in Las Vegas without question.  Brooklyn Bowl is #2.

Friendly Southern hospitality and smiling faces serve you the best southern food in the LVC.

They have great cornbread to keep you occupied while you wait for the chicken, which is made to order so expect to wait a few minutes for the freshness."}
{"text":"Visiting from new york. Wanted to venture out and try some soulfood. Service was great and food was delicious. Ordered fried chicken collard greens and mashed potatoes. Everything was delish. 
Waitresses are completely upbeat always smiling and seems like they all work well together. 
Would highly recommend"}
{"text":"This. Is a breath of fresh air.. everyone is nice. You get greeted. As soon as you walk in. Thats a plus. And the food... the food is fantastic. Definitely check it"}
{"text":"This location on Charleston has always been my go to place for soul food, I had always put them above other soul food restaurant that have come and gone over the years, BUT I went in 2 days ago to take my friend for a bday dinner, my grand daughter was also there, she was buying me dinner for mother's day, and dinner for herself as well, well we walked in almost empty, the waitress was either new or didn't know much about being a waitress, it was the worst food EVER, CHITTERLINGS still had trash, cabbage and greens no flavor, tasted watery, banana pudding was like mush with one black banana at the bottom, peach cobbler was so doughy and had a sour taste, I was and am so disappointed in M & M's at this point, don't when or if I will ever go back, that put a bad taste in my mouth, I would like to add that I had not been there for a while, because it is so far from where I live"}
{"text":"I was there a couple of months ago, at the one on Charleston and Valley View, and I had horrible service and the food was not much better, they were very good at one time, I don't know what has happened with them. My 17year old grand daughter took me there for my bday in November, and we were both disappointed.. gloria"}
{"text":"Had the full plate short ribs, green beans, mac & cheese, red beans and rice, and a coke. 

I thought the full plate was a half plate. This place is not bad, but overpriced. The food isn't Michelin quality. If the prices for meals were cheaper then I'd go as high as 3 to 4 stars.

Food came out quick. Servers were average in noticing needs of diners. Servers were always in a hurry...not looking at diners when asking questions and halfway off to their next task before an answer was given.

Friendly atmosphere.

C/C+"}
{"text":"Food here was so delicious, service was great. Chicken and waffles was excellent. Chicken was cooked perfect and the waffles have a hint of cinnamon. We also had the sweet tea which was good too.

I recommend it."}
{"text":"This is an OASIS of southern cooking in a vast & dreary desert... BEST SERVICE that's only outdone by ,\"WORLD CLASS FOOD\"... Trust a fat man & get busy eating this! Try the 2 pork chips, waffles, chicken fried chicken, spare rib, meat loaf, peach cobbler, & I love their sunny sides eggs too... I'm fat; That's my everyday order..."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to visit when I come to LV. If you want some home cooking soul food this is the place to visit in LV. Pancake cornbread isso delicious! Fried chicken, catfish, oxtails, greens and candy yams are a must!"}
{"text":"While on a weekend vacation in vegas we ate at all the big name chefs restaurants,  and M&M beat them all by a mile.  We went for breakfast and had our favorite meal of the trip, I had the best chicken and waffles I've ever had (and I've eaten a lot of chicken and waffles).  My wife had the catfish, eggs, potatos, and a biscuit,  all was cooked and seasoned to perfection.  The catfish was delicious!!  We were so glad we took the time to find this hidden treasure. We go to vegas 2 to 3 times a year and now we will be eating at M&M 2 to 3 times a year, if not more, we may eat their everyday that we are in vegas."}
{"text":"Visited on Monday morning, November 9.
My major issues with this place is that the waitress had a real attitude.  Not only that but she had a cell phone to her ear from the time we were seated to the time we left, over an hour.
Service was practically non existent.   Several times I had to get up and go to the counter for incidentals.  Getting a refill on coffee was like pulling teeth, we never did get a water refill.

I ate there twice while in Vegas.  The meatloaf dry with the consistency of a can of dog food.  For my Monday breakfast I ordered sausage and eggs, all bland.

To be fair, my friend really enjoyed his gumbo but completely turned off with the service."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken mac/cheese, potato salad and cabbage. Chicken was fried and seasoned well. While the cabbage lacked any seasoning and or taste. Mac was ok and the potato salad was trash. Overall experience could have been better had to wait almost  40 minutes for food but staff was friendly and polite"}
{"text":"Always got to have their chicken and waffles, fried okra, oxtail when in Vegas. Service is great. One of our must go to places."}
{"text":"A whole in the wall spot. Catfish was salty and wasn't battered properly. The mac n cheese and red beans and rice was cool. The koolaid was yummy. Customer service was good! Except for the guy was sweeping under my table while I was sitting there. Probably won't go back"}
{"text":"Was in the neighborhood and decided to check it out. I had the oxtail dinner with a side of mac n cheese, dressing, and collard greens. and sweet tea. I will review each item individually. 

Pros:
1. you are greeted immediately as you enter by friendly staff
2. I received complimentary pancakes

Cons:
1.wait. Took me five minutes to get my drink. I came in at 430 didn't leave until 5 with my food that i ordered to go. the menu does state extended times for fried dishes though
2. small portions for certain dishes, (oxtail)

Now onto the food:
1.Oxtails- I am Jamaican and we make oxtails differently but I wanted to try them southern style. I was a bit disappointed. There was mostly fat on the bone and I know oxtail is not the cheapest of meats but i should not pay near twenty bucks for a meal and get kiddie portions.
2. mac n cheese- it was nothing spectacular. You could tell whomever made this batch put way too much Lawry's season salt in it. because that's all I could taste. 
3. dressing- it tasted great but was a bit too mushy for me and smothered with gravy on top. The oxtails already had gravy and then more gravy was put on the dressing, too much gravy for me.
4. collard greens- again, nothing special. needed some more flavor and spice

5. sweet tea- I ordered it and got it in this little mason jar. Um, hello, I'm an adult. a bigger glass please. It was OK tasting as well.

lastly is the complimentary cornbread pancakes, or whatever you want to call them. I was puzzled by this. Since when does a soul food restaurant serve cornbread pancakes? What ever happened to traditional cornbread served square? And they were so thin!


Over all this place get 3 stars. idk about A-ok, it was just OK. I will return again though and try something else on the menu. this place isnt horrible, it isnt faboulous either."}
{"text":"Eh. I grew up in texas and owe my love hamdles to the soul food i grew up on however if the food is gonna be amazingky fattening i wish it was tastier. Im sorry i just feel like top ramen had a cousin made with gravy that got fried on the way and it turned into a restaurant. Nit bad but not great which i was hoping fir."}
{"text":"OMG!  Stumbled across this location by accident and I am so glad I did!  The food and the service was outstanding!  Very clean.  Great staff. I would fly back to Vegas just for the cornbread!"}
{"text":"I have only been there once but I had a great experience. All the staff is friendly and greets you as you come in. However the service was just average. The real great thing about this place is the food. Best koolaid, best fried chicken, best waffles ever! They serve your drinks in jars which I love, and the best thing there is the chicken and waffles.  The fried chicken is so flavorful and juicy and the cinnamon waffles are as fluffy as bunnies. Overall great place to eat."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating food from here. I've been in Vegas 7 mos, asking people where to go. I ordered from doordash. The short rib half order with greens, red beans and rice. The ribs had too much fat on them, swimming in oily gravy but the meat was tender and seasoned. Greens so-so, the beans and rice needed sauce but seasoned well but those mini pankcake cornbread looking things weren't tasty at all."}
{"text":"I decided to have a carry out order here of half order of catfish. I did not receive sweet water cornbread with my order which is always included with every meal and i won't be eating at M&M again. I don't feel like i am getting what i pay for when i dine here, 15 dollars including tax and tip and I'm still very hungry."}
{"text":"Good soul food. Nice staff. Over rated, but not bad. Seemed like it wasn't in a great area. There was an armed security guard. I'd go back."}
{"text":"Honestly, I was disappointed. I went there ready to order Catfish, when the people that I was with told me not to. I asked why and was told \"because it's not Catfish\". I was shocked as hell! I asked our waitress if the Catfish was Catfish or something else, she laughed and kept walking, when she came back around I asked her again and she said \"no it's Swai\". Sooo, you're charging almost  $15 for Catfish, when everyone knows that Swai is $1.50-$2. a pound? If that's not bizarre, crazy, and deceitful, then what is?? The you lady stated that if the customer asks if it's really Catfish, then they tell them, otherwise they don't say anything. But why would a customer ask if the food that they were ordering is really the food that they were ordering? Anyway, I ordered the roast chicken, which was drowned in gravy, the Collard greens had a weird sweetness to them, and the Mac & Cheese was ok. And, some big bald security guy with a gun kept walking back and forth behind us, that was just a lil crazy to me. Not going back."}
{"text":"Went here last night for my first time...the catfish and chicken were amazing but the mac n cheese was freezing cold and dry. All the other sides were okay nothing special. Like i said the chicken and catfish were great id get that alone but none of the sides were that appetizing"}
{"text":"My friends came from out of state I live here but never been there before, so we decided to go on a Friday night it was kind of slow. Got a seat fast but took a while to get drinks and our order taking. It took quite sometime for our order to come out then when we received our food it was quite disappointing. For one our silverware was dirty, when we got our food it was horrified it was cold the smother chicken and gravy is like they fried the meat and dumped hella gravy over it, to cover the look the plates were dripping with gravy, and also it was cold. So disappointed I cook soul food and that place is definitely not it. The server was trying to be nice about it, but come on the food was just not up to par. The greens were out of a can, I was more embarrassed than anything taking my friends there I would of been better cooking myself. I can't believe this place has even been open this long, I felt I wasted my money was pissed and still hungry. If Chef Ramsey would of went in there he would of closed them down. Big F for me!!!!!!!!!! Really no stars it wouldn't let me post without putting anything......"}
{"text":"Since I hardly cook at home, to have soul food from M & M is Soulfully Delicious treat on vacation.  The fried catfish was the BOMB! Service is outstanding"}
{"text":"I give this place a one star because of  the service not the food.  The food is fine.  But the service is outrageous and the place isn't that clean. I've eaten there a lot; I forgave the crappy service too many times, but after the last visit, I stopped eating.  What waitress decides to fill out your credit card receipt?  I looked at this illiterate moron like she lost her mind!  Soooo, I just stopped eating there months ago.  I stopped recommending the place and I refuse to go back.   The bad unorganized service isn't worth eating there anymore.  The prices are fine and if you don't mind dumb waitresses, it's the place for you.  How many times should a waitress asked what do you want after she's written it down a billion times and she still asks!  WTF?  And I'm a great tipper, but after the last time, I was pissed off forever!"}
{"text":"This \"soul food\" was cooked with hate instead of love! We ordered through postmates and our order was not only completely screwed up, the food was horrible. The killer part was some man called ahead to confirm our order and they still screwed it up! $108 for burnt fried chicken, cheeseless macaroni and cheese, tough ribs, and disguisting oxtails. We were charged for things we didn't receive and food arrived cold. Will never order from here again. I can make better at home, so I definitely feel a way paying $100 for this crap :/"}
{"text":"Very slow service and the food isn't that great. The main location maybe better. Dirty tea bag, no water refills, waitress running around with her head cu"}
{"text":"Ok....this was the best soul food I've had since I've been in Vegas! We ordered catfish, chicken wings, smothered catfish and my husband couldn't decide between the catfish and the snapper so the server suggested trying one filet of each, needless to say he was very happy he took her up on her suggestion.  But wait, I missed an important part, as we were sitting down, they gave us hot cornbread pancakes. I've had cornbread, I've had pancakes and I must say....two great tastes mixed up into one(where've I heard that before?). Everything was really good. Our sides were yams, greens, cabbage, red beans and rice, fried okra and Mac & cheese. My only critique is of the red beans and rice, I like juice and they were a bit dry, but the flavor of the beans was really good. The cabbage had too much black pepper for me, so I just took my husbands mac and cheese and gave him my cabbage and he loved it. Mac and cheese was really cheesy and creamy, the greens were delicious, the okra was ok, needed some seasoning but had a nice crispy batter and was fried perfectly. My cousins smothered pork chops were so tender and flavorful she really didn't need a knife to cut them...enough said? Fish was flaky and well seasoned. Yams were delicious, not overly sweet, but very mellow. Oh and did I mention the RED KOOL AID? Get it mixed with the lemonade, delish!!!! The food here is really good! So if you have a hankering for soul food, go to M & M's. I'm really sad that I had to knock off a star for the dry (ish) red beans and the peppery cabbage, but it's just my personal preference. Someone else may love it that way! Oh well, I guess I'll just have to go again to see if anything has changed when I come back to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The food is good here.  Come with an appetite.  They offer large portions.  The cornbread pancakes were a good introduction to better food to come.  The service is excellent and our waitress made us feel welcome.  It was our first time here.  It will not be our last."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place. The place itself is average, the ladies restroom was not very clean, however the food was delicious. I had the smothered fried chicken and it was to die for. My daughter had the chicken and waffles, which was delicious. The mac and cheese and mash potatoes where delicious. The mash potatoes I feel need more salt, but I just added it. The peach cobbler with ice cream was the best I ever had. You will not be disappointed! Service was fast and friendly. They also serve these cornbread pancakes which were so good."}
{"text":"We were craving soul food when we were out in Vegas and a local recommended us here and it was GREAT!!! The ribs were finger licking good, ox tail w/ gravy is delicious, and the sides were fabulous.  We didn't get a chance to try the chicken because they fry it when you order it. The waitress said it would've taken about 20 minutes to cook and it was almost closing time so we had to pass.  We'll definitely come back when we're in town and by far one of the best soul food joints i've been too..."}
{"text":"The food was amazing the employees look like they are having a lot of fun! Great experience! I would give a five star but the seating could be better"}
{"text":"Great Improvement since we ate at M & M's years ago!

The restaurant was very warm for a July afternoon, bearable, the staff did move us to a cooler location in the restaurant. 

Good food BUT, who serves -GUMBO without saltine crackers and LIVER and ONIONS without white rice or mashed potatoes...who...where not a soul food restaurant, you know better. And we question the size of the catfish filets (huge-but they do not claim organic) 2 filets of catfish as a whole order and 1 filet as half, that's a first. 

The waitress and waiters where extremely friendly and patient for a party of 12 hungry people, they made it a very nice experience and we will return for the excellent customer service they provided."}
{"text":"Great authentic soul food. Best fried chicken I have ever tasted. I literally fought my friends over it. We all got different dishes there 3 times in a row and had to guard our food from each other. Finger licking good does not begin to cover it. Very nice service as well, hooking us up with sweet tea refills all the time. I am going to miss this place big time :("}
{"text":"I was visiting Las Vegas a couple of weekends ago.  I always enjoy trying out new places to eat, but I was getting bored with the usual mainstream food on or near The Strip.  Because I genuinely enjoy soul food, I went on Yelp and looked up local soul food joints and found M&M Soul Food Cafe.  My friend and I made the drive over and it was completely worth it.

I had the smothered chicken with black eyed peas and mac & cheese.  It was delicious and the portions were large.  I could only eat half and decided to take the rest back with me on my drive back home.  I wound up eating the leftovers for dinner that night.

If you have room for dessert I definitely recommend the caramel cake.  Ridiculously good.

The staff there was super friendly and the wait time was a bit long, but they were hopping busy.  Completely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken in Vegas. Mac & Cheese is fantastic. The chicken and waffles are tough to pass on as well. Friendly staff always makes you feel welcome."}
{"text":"When I say I miss those hole in the wall mom and pop shops that serve the BEST food, I am defiantely talking about places like this!!!  I have to put this place at the top in terms of fried chicken and cornbread (they serve them as little pancakes)!!!  And I know I will get people saying something else is better but this is MY review and what I say goes! Haha!!!  I usually get the Fried Chicken Breast (it takes 20 min to cook and it even says that on the menu) which is the most succulent luciously mouthwater peice of chicken that I ever had the honor to put my lips around (yes, I just said that!).  Also the cornbread pancakes are sooo AWESOME!!!  I really don't know how else to put it, but I think it's because they make them in pancake form that it gives you the light, airy, crunchyness and moistness that you want from normal cornbread but that normal cornbread can't deliver (sorry normal cornbread, I still have love for you though).  And of course you have the sides which are GREAT!!!  You can't really understand it until you've tried it, so get crackin!!!!  Oh, and if you go during breakfast time make sure to try their Chicken and Waffles, all I have to say about that is they are card carrying members of what Chicken and Waffles are supposed to be!!!!!"}
{"text":"Omg! Awesome place. Were going to IHOP. Saw this place across the street. The people there were friendly.  Greeted us right away. Loved the food n atmosphere. Felt like i was at home!"}
{"text":"Delicious. I had the catfish dinner w/fried okras & mac 'n cheese, but the service was exceptional!"}
{"text":"Service: Mediocre
Food: Was okay. What was good, greens, kool aid, red beans, fried catfish, fried chicken, and eggs, if they havent run out. What was bad, yams were all sugar, no spice. Mac n Cheese was bland. Grits, flavorless. I remember this place when they were on MLK for theyre BBQ. Portions are small for price. Half= 1 piece of protein. I think I'll try Lolo's soul food next time."}
{"text":"This place was awesome the first time I visited earlier this year but it was not the same on our recent visit. 

Chicken was fine. Collard greens delicious. Fried okra good. 

Waffles were not as crispy on the outside as last time, which made me really sad. 

Lastly...and most disappointing was that I saw a roach crawling on their wall near their kitchen. No one from the staff even noticed. 

It's too bad because I thought I found a gem the last time I stayed in Vegas."}
{"text":"I was visiting from North Carolina to Vegas over spring break and NOBODY frys chicken wings like my grandma (im talking best in town) but I was completely blown away by these wings they tasted exactly like my grandmothers wings down to the crisp and seasoning!!! The sweet tea was also amazing. The only reason I'm not giving five stars is because I wish the eggs and potatoes had some seasoning, other than that everything including our server tarsha was great!!!!"}
{"text":"Had high expectations walking in. Left with a full non-satisfying stomach. After gorging on buffets for 3 days straight we decided to switch it up. Found it on yelp and based on the reviews I was already salivating.  

The order:
Fried chicken with side of gravy. It was crisp and fresh but lacking in flavor. Gravy didn't have much flavor either I added a ton of salt.

Sweet tea- listen to our fellow Yelpers and get the muddy water. Better than the sweet tea.

Fried oka- AMAZING! I have never had okra before but it was small and crisp and we fell in love.

Mac & cheese- meh

Mashed potatoes- so fresh, you can taste it! 

Service was good considering how busy they were and prices are cheap. Maybe I have been spoiled by eating all the rich in flavor food but I would have been happy getting the muddy waters along w some okra and picked up some Popeye's fried chicken.  That would be an epic meal"}
{"text":"Good food but the service is lacking. It seems every time we have come except for once the waitress has a problem."}
{"text":"The staff was amazing. The food was on point loved it first time visiting Vegas definitely when I come back will return here for some good soul food"}
{"text":"My daughter and I ate at M & M on Sunday, 2/19.  My daughter had the Chicken and Waffles and I had a traditional breakfast.  I didn't like the toast or the coffee, but the eggs, grits and turkey links were good. I wanted to go back for lunch.  The entrees looked really appetizing.  Also, I loved the uniforms and the cleanliness."}
{"text":"M & M Soul Food Cafe is one of the BEST, most satisfying dining experiences I had in Las Vegas. I would never have found this place on my own (located in a super-tacky strip mall), but thanks to a foodie friend who is a Las Vegas local, we went. I ordered the short ribs, sweet potatoes (yams), and greens. She ordered chicken wings. OMG! everything was amazingly delicious. 

The nice attentive efficient waitress starts you out with two light, delicate cornbread pancakes that were slightly crispy on the edges, and slightly sweet,  tender, full of fresh flavor -- just amazing. Like getting perfect dessert first!

Everything we ordered was way, way beyond expectations. Mac and cheese is just what you hope it will be (but in most places never is). Greens and yams perfectly complimented the melt-in-your mouth short ribs. The vinagar-based hot sauce on the table provided that touch of sharpness that made all the dishes exactly satisfying. All portions VERY generous. Chicken wings were huge and the best chicken I've ever eaten.  

One negative: Ordered banana pudding and peach cobbler. Both were bad -- pudding tasted like 'Nilla wafers and pudding mix; cobbler was canned peaches with tough crumbled up pie crust (my guess). Both desserts sickeningly sweet and clearly made out of processed food.  My foodie friend told me both desserts were standard African American nostalgia foods and were exactly what AA people would expect them to be.  Whatever. 

Service: Excellent
Dinner food: Beyond excellent
Dessert: Sucky
Price: Very reasonable considering quantity and quality.  

I wish I could go there right now (but I'm not in Las Vegas)."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice while visiting Las Vegas. The service was good on both visits. On the last visit I ordered the fried chicken and my husband ordered ox tails. Our sides were macaroni and cheese, cabbage, rice/gravy, yams and pinto beans. All of which were delicious! They have a great system because they serve your meal very fast for a soul food establishment. The food was fresh, hot and we enjoyed it. Definitely a must go if you visiting or live in Las Vegas! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I am in Vegas a half dozen times or more a year. I used to take potential clients to the upscale $200/ plate joints on the strip. I have since started taking them here and the relaxed atmosphere, great wait staff and PHENOMENAL FOOD have won us (and our clients) over.
I grew up in Harlem, and often ate at Wells, the original chicken and waffle spot. In my opinion, the C&W at M&M beats the pants off of Roscoe's.
Do yourself a favor, eat here. 
Downside is that they close too early."}
{"text":"I was happy to see this location open since we live in the area.
We decided to go for breakfast because I wanted grits and eggs.
When we arrived at 10:00 AM there were 3 other tables. We placed our order and the place started to fill up.
20 minutes later we still didn't have our beverages and people were being served that arrived after we did. So, we left."}
{"text":"Stephanie was very nice a friendly. Came in for breakfast ordered salmon croquettes and catfish breakfast. The catfish was good. The salmon croquettes were disgusting. Please don't order this. Super dry and It didn't taste like salmon. Wouldn't be surprised if it's filled with tuna. Don't be fooled by the 4 stars. Maybe better for lunch or dinner but chef couldn't make over medium well eggs. They literally ran off my plate. She knew they messed up when she came by 3 minutes after dropping off the food to pick up the plate that the eggs were still running off of. but I didn't even bother saying anything. But she knew I don't like sending food back unless there is hair or foreign substances in it. True. The biscuits were ok but flat and greasy. The grits with cheese we ordered were screaming for cheese. I didn't ask for extra :/      The breakfast potatoes were ok. Best thing I ate was the catfish and it COULDA been cooked a bit harder. Stephanie and the catfish get one star each :)"}
{"text":"We met up with friends for lunch and had to wait for over 30 minutes for a menu. The restaurant was short menus so we had to wait for menus to become available. Overall the food was great, and the waitress was awesome and very accommodating."}
{"text":"Terrible!! Waited a hour for a leg and breast meal. The only thing good were the yams. Barely any cheese on the macaroni & cheese, greens were sweet, and the black eye peas tasted like pickles. Keep your money and spend it elsewhere! My friend had to go to the bathroom to vomit the smothered pork chops they ordered."}
{"text":"Customer Service was GREAT!!! i ordered ala carte short ribs && beans and rice.. so good... the ribs had so much flavor. the cornbread pancakes was just the kick to start off a great meal. ill be coming back again"}
{"text":"Food was great but felt a little akward becue me and my friend were the only white guys thier, it felt like i was the big elephant in the room. Not the great service but the food was awsome!!!"}
{"text":"It was disgusting. The chops were soggy & cold. The mac n cheese is better in a school lunchroom. I'll never eat it again. I now see most black folk don't know good food because that was nasty"}
{"text":"We were heading out to Red Rock and passed by this place.
Who doesn't like comfort food?

Especially fried chicken with okra which was the best I've had.
It's very welcoming and homey. The sides we got besides the okra was mac and cheese which was good too.

I just liked the overall feel of the place and the food was good. Can't ask for more than that."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good... The service was ok. If your looking for a nice cooked soul food place, come here ... I use to go to this other place but it too far .."}
{"text":"Try to give this place a second chance after bad service at the Charleston location were I waited for over and hour to be told they ran out of food. Well today was worse. They sat us in the hot part of the restaurant and when we asked if they had AC they said oh let us move you to the other side. After we waited for 15 mins with no greeting we approached the counter asking for a manager which they never seem to have we noticed the cook LICKING HIS FINGERS WHILE COOKING and the waitress USING HER DIRTY HANDS picking feathers off the already fried chicken. I knew I wasn't eating there at that point. We told the lady about our problem her response was \"ok what you want I got yal\" and that point I was done. I'm still waiting for the manager to call me back after my fiscal Friday night at the W. Charleston location. I'm done. You try to support black establishments but they just don't wanna do right."}

Noticed ppl were getting their food before ours sat there 20 mins for chicken n waffles. 
Had to ask for refills had to ask for check.  I could get better chicken n waffles at the hash house!! 
Never going back! Stinks also!"}
{"text":"I took my wife there and she didn't want to get out of the car.  But finally she went in.  She was keep looking at me like \"Where the hell did you take me?\" kind of look.  She ordered fried chicken and I ordered fried catfish.  Somehow the waitress asked me if I want it crispy.  I said yes.  When the food arrive, my wife was a happy camper.  She said the chicken was crispy and very good.  My catfish was very good and I was glad I ordered little more crispy.  This catfish was the 2nd best catfish I ever had.  The best one was at the Dot's in Austin Texas.  Too bad it burned down.  I was told she reopened at other place but I don't live in Texas anymore."}
{"text":"Visited different location before. Uoon arrival their was a sign in sheet eith no pen for you to sign yourself in. No one greeted us until after we waited anout 10 minutes when a guy appeared and asked did you sign yourself in. The servers were moving with urgency but just not tbe level of service I expect. 

I had smothered pork chop, greens, yams and fried okra. It was decent but lukewarm. The okra and corn cakes were the best. My son had fried chicken, mac n cheese, yams & greens. Chicken, greens and yams were tasty however they ran out of  mac n cheese so no comment other than better food prep for orders. 

The service and quality of food was not worth the cost! Not a place I will revisit."}

{"text":"The food is great and the staff are very friendly. The new location is much bigger then the other one so if you have a party of more then 5 come here."}
{"text":"I really wish no stars were an option here. As a local I was excited about the second location due to the Charleston one being so small and this one having a later closing time. Um, scrach that nonsense! It was shady enough in the daytime on a Sunday after church I don't even wanna know what Saturday night is like. First things you relise is parking sucks. Maybe 4 spots 1 of which is handicapped but you could park at the pay by the hour hotel right nextdoor. My party of 5 was shuffled to the far back past several empty tables after waiting 20 minutes already to a dirty table that can seat 8. I place my expense camera on far end of the table away from my party. We order, fried chicken both white and dark meat were order, paid extra, spliting sides of different things at the table, all 5 ordered waters. 15 minutes later our water shows up, dropping off on the side of the table that has my camera, purses and so on you know, not the people. But no straws but she'll be back. 10 minutes later dry mac n cheese, still no straws and a leg. I had the kids split it. They are hit and hungry. 3 larger groups have now come on and have been seated with their order taken. 
Oh look, our straw showed up, just 1, 4 more to go. We ask another waiter he said he'll be right back, he was swallowed by the black hole too. A thigh, and the saddest strip of chicken came out. We pointed and said whats that, is that supposed to be a breast the waitress said \" I don't know I don't eat meat\". Those 3 large groups  are finishing up their meals now, Im still a piece of dried out over cooked piece of chicken! I cant hardly wait to leave. No complimentary cornbread cakes like normal, no knowledge of your food, overcooked, under served, I question going back to the original on Charleston after this experience. Hated the environment, the food, the staff. The magic and warm feeling of home you used to have is gone with this place."}
{"text":"This place is awful. Paid 18 dollars for oxtails but my order was for a kid..lol.   Made them give me regular size oxtails..Check your to go orders before you leave..The sides were awful and not seasoned at all.."}
{"text":"When your soul needs soul food so you go to get some and your the only white face in the restaraunt and none of the waitresses approach you  definitely not welcoming to white people"}
{"text":"Came to M&M's at the suggestion of two friends when they heard I was visiting Vegas. I was very pleased. Actually visited twice the same weekend! The service was awesome each time. All the staff was personable and friendly. Anything that needed refilling was done, no questions asked, and regardless how busy it was (second visit we had to wait for a table about 20 minutes) they took the time to talk and treat us like family. We never once felt rushed. And the food was great. I grew up eating food like they serve so I'm not easily impressed but it was much like to remembered! Nothing was sitting under a light. You can hear the chicken frying in the background. Will be one of my stops when I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"We visit Vegas once a year and always go to M&M on Charleston, so we were happy to hear about this new location on the Strip...

Unfortunately, it's not quite the same....

The parking is almost nonexistent... A few spots on the side of the restaurant. But it's a much larger dining room and the restroom was very clean.

We got there on a Sunday around 10:30am and decided to have breakfast.... We later decided that maybe we should have chosen the iHop across the street.

After placing our order, we realized that there was a group of about 12 people seated behind us. Each one of them got their food.... One plate at a time.... Our waitress came by after about 45 minutes to tell us that our food was \"next\".... 

After about 10 more minutes, the people at the next table joked with us that \"they must have had to kill a hog to get your breakfast\"..... they had been served and were finished eating before we got any food

I ordered the omelet and pancakes.... Omelet came with a biscuit sliced in half. Half order of pancakes was two.... They were large with warm syrup. The pancakes were whole wheat, with a touch of cinnamon... If this had been described on the menu, I wouldn't have ordered them.... But they were nice and tasty, as was the omelet.

My husband ordered the Denver omelet with hash browns. Again, the omelet came with one sliced biscuit, so I gave him mine. The potatoes, priced at $2.50, came out on a saucer and looked to be about 2 ounces! 

One other thing.... Proofread your menu! There is no such thing as a \"salmon crochet\"! LOL try \"croquette\"....

We think the problem is that there needs to be more help in the kitchen.... Maybe they had only one cook who was cooking one order at a time.... We'll probably give this one more try but will probably drive out to the Charleston location if we see no improvement."}
{"text":"This restaurant has Worst service. Me and a couple friends walked in had to wait while others were seated right away. The worst part is receiving your food before my drink..0 stars for this rude establishment."}
{"text":"The Workers at the Charleston Location ARE COMPLETELY RACIST!!! Three of us went in there ALL white and the server was rude, greeted us by saying we are in the middle of breakfast and lunch only a limited menu and would check on the available items.Didn't come back for 10 mins and said just order and she will let us know if they have it well EVERYTHING we picked they didn't have. Then I started getting suspicious because she wasn't the nicest about anything and didn't even bring us our drinks . We ended up ordering 1 dessert a side dish and appetizer which after 30 mins still was not up. So we got the point they were not going to serve us and left! We were discriminated AGAINST AND THIS IS A RACIEST place of business!!! It deserves 0 stars!!!!! DO NOT GO HERE AND SUPPORT THIS RACIST ESTABLISHMENT!!"}
{"text":"i ate here at 8am in the morning and they blast loud music in the early hours i dont think i have ever been to a restaraunt that has such loud music in the early hours like this i got a bad headache and felt rather irritated by it. 

the menu looked like it was written by a 5th grader, its written in a very basic form of english.

the food portion is super little and the food was no different than what i can prepare at home...."}
{"text":"I don't know where to start, from the friendly staff to the incredible fried chicken it's hard to fault an unpretentious place like this.  You're not there for the atmosphere, it's all about the food that definitely feels like someone cared about making it.

The fried chicken was one the best I've ever had.  It was not greasy whatsoever, skin that just melted in your mouth and yet the meat stayed moist and juicy.  The fried okra and greens were a perfect side to the chicken and the yams were basically more like dessert.  I'm not sure if they are normally supposed to be that sweet (not sickly sweet though) but I think it still worked well as a side dish.

Gumbo was stupidly good and pretty large for a small bowl!  If you order the large, be prepared to share as it's very substantial.  I didn't get a chance to ask if they made the sausage but it sure did not taste like anything you could buy in a store.  It was nice that they used real crab in it instead of the cheap imitation stuff.

I'm almost glad that they don't have a place like this up here cause I would probably be visiting it every second day and gaining many kgs in the process."}
{"text":"The worst place to ever eat at. The customer service is horrible. While sitting waiting for my food the busser was picking up the dishing slamming them in the bus tub. The waitress precedes to tell me we don't have time to place them in the tub so we slam them. (Sounds like dishes are breaking) I asked for cornbread dressing and I received smashed up cornbread with gravy.  My friend asked to have her tea replaced with koolaide because it was Nasty, the waitress brings her back her same glass with the same straw (lipstick was on the straw).  I asked to speak to a manager and was told  there is no manager only a chef.   The worst dining experience ever, not sure how your still in business"}
{"text":"This was my first time at M&M. I have to say that walking in there I was a tad nervous because the restaurant looked a little run down.
My attitude changed quickly when one of the waitresses greeted me with a hello and a huge smile. 
I ordered the ox tail with yams and Mac & cheese with a coke beverage. It was a nice surprise when my drink came in a cute little jar with a straw in it. 
The service was super fast! I waited less than 10 minutes for my food and the quality was actually really good. The ox tail was tender and the gravy was delicious. Yams were oh so sweet and the homemade Mac & cheese was adequate. Tons of food and endless Coke refills. 
Will definitely be going back there :)"}
{"text":"Yankees and caucasians: Try the ox tail! Yes it has a bone and sounds... well it sounds disgusting, but it is delicious. Mac and cheese was good. Collards good too. Johnny cakes came with the meal. 1/2 order was filling."}

{"text":"MMMMM mmm good!! I ordered the smothered white chicken, mac and cheese, cornbread dressing w/ gravy, and collard greens. 

Ok so I went the day after Valentine's Day and it was very very very BUSY!! I called my order ahead and they told me they were very busy and the wait time. No problem my Pregnant belly & I was so craving soul food. When I got there it was packed door to door.  I had previously called from car and asked for them to call me when my food was ready. I saw people were walking out left and right so I figured they were busy.

The owner Tim was very attentive giving me updates and checking w/ me and the hostesses were warm and very friendly. After looking at my reciept I realized I was overcharged for something. I called over the very lovely server Tashera and brought it to her attention. She quickly took ownership apologizing stating it is very busy it must've been an honest mistake. She then gave me the difference from her own tip money $5. She insisted I take it and I was really impressed by that. 

Anyhow I finaly got my food and was surprised they had added a complimentary banana pudding dessert I quickly got to my car and me and my pregnant belly were so very satisfied. It was sooooooooooo worth the wait!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and great staff!! The BBQ chicken was so soft and tender and if they had such a thing as bottomless banana pudding I don't think I would ever stop."}
{"text":"oh my goodness the food here is good. the collard greens are cooked to perfection never over cooked or too dry. the oxtail and gravy great seasoning very moist easy to eat don't even need utensils. the cornbread stuffing tastes really good, but I'm not too sure on the cornbread pancakes. the service was good I didn't have any problems. the fried food is really good , but be prepared to wait.  they make it fresh they don't pre cook it and then just serve it. the chitterlings tastes really good but I was just a full order not the house."}
{"text":"We came in the restaurant around 7:45 we were told to sit down someone would be with you there's a 45 minute wait,ok no problem around 8:00 the girl came and said here you guys can sit at any table, ok except there all dirty but she disappeared,  so we sit down after 30 mins no one came to take our order, oh her comes a waitress but oh no she doesn't come to our table she takes the order of 2 guys who had just sit down 2 minutes before she walked in the room and went right back to the kitchen without even acknowledging us . So finally the  lady who cleans tables asked us if we had been help and went to get our drinks let's cut to the end We waited an hour and 15 minutes before a waitress ever came for our order. Service POOR food ok. Will I be back doubt it thumbs down"}
{"text":"This restaurant  is horrible  I got hot water corn bread and it was a pancake the service  was OK but the food was dry and hotrible."}
{"text":"I recently moved to las vegas and my wife and I were craving some good ol soul food. We stumbled across this place while taking a drive. When we walked in it smelled great and the service was emaculant. The food was wonderful as well. We both had the fried chicken. My wife got the mac and cheese and I got the collard greens for our sides. Highly recommend this place if you want some good southern grub."}
{"text":"This time I went for breakfast while visiting Las Vegas. I ordered Smoothered Liver and Onions. It was hot and delicious. I originally ordered grits. That was not so good but, the nice waitress offered to let me change it to the home fries. Those were very good. I will be returning the next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"I got there kinda close to closing the food could have been hotter with that said I would still go back to eat.  Soul food that is good is very hard to come by ."}
{"text":"So a friend of mine recommended this spot, as he and his friends come here quite often.  Now I see why.   Being from Hawaii, you don't see many Southern comfort food places back home, so I was game to try something different.  First off, unfortunately the day that we went, they had a power outage, but the restaurant and kitchen were still open and happily serving customers.  Right off the bat, I could feel welcomed as the waitresses and even the owner welcomed us in.  Everybody was so kind and genuinely cared about their customer service, so it showed.

My friend ordered his usual, the oxtails and I ordered the smothered chicken.  We both had the mac & cheese sides, as well as the red beans and rice and collard greens.  I also ordered a side order of hot wings and some sweet tea.

While we were waiting for our meals, they serve you these amazing corn bread pancakes. They were piping hot and had just the right amount of sweetness and crunch along the edges.  When our entrees came, I couldn't wait to dig in.  I tried my smothered chicken first and the chicken was still crispy and so hot and juicy.  Then the gravy hits you......omg that gravy.  So tasty.  I had a bite of my friends oxtails and they were amazing as well.  Not too fatty, super tender, and swimming in that wonderful gravy.  I also loved the hot wings too, as they were incredibly crunchy, juicy, and quite meaty.  I thank my friend for introducing me to this spot.  Had it not been for him, I wouldn't have ever known about this gem

*** On a side note, I know that the owner fully understands and lives customer service.  As we were wrapping up our meal, one of the customers requested if they could sit outside (power was out remember?, and the restaurant was a little warm).  Without hesitation, he jumped into action and set up a table for 2 outside the restaurant for them.  The owner did this.  Now if that's not  a man who cares about his customers, I don't know what is."}
{"text":"Had lunch with coworkers and we were all satisfied with service and food. Entrees: Oxtails and Fried Chicken. Sides: Cabbage, Macaroni and Cheese, Black eyed peas, Candied Yams. We were all comforted with each bite. The food was definitely good for our souls."}
{"text":"I agree with the previous poster that there is confusion in the seating.  Regardless, my wife and I loved the food.  The restaurant was busy and the service was friendly.  I recommend the restaurant and I will return."}
{"text":"Great food,nice staff.Almost as good as Roscoe's in LA.The chicken is great, but the syrup for the waffles is very stringy.Nice family vibe."}
{"text":"Worst experience. I came in last night for dinner with my family and the customer service was horrible. When we arrived it was 40 min wait to be seated which they weren't even busy . Then after we were seated they was out of red snapper , meatloaf, short ribs , waffles, cornbread, Mac and cheese, and stuffing. When we got our order together and ordered we waited for a hour and ten minutes when we finally got fed up of waiting and seeing people get served that came in after us. We approach our server to find out what was happening to find out our order was given to another table and that our food wasn't on the way . When asked to speak with management they said there was no manager at this point we were all fed up and just decided to leave. Never again ?"}
{"text":"The m&m soul food cafe is a very good place to eat, they're priced reasonably and not to far from LV Strip. I had the smothered pork chop dinner with mac & cheese and red beans & rice as sides. Overall pretty good nothing spectacular; it was a fair meal at a fair price. The interior could use some updating to improve the overall appearance."}
{"text":"we went to m &m's because of the reviews we saw, and i am pleased to say it was the TITS!  They have koolaid!! but i got the sweet tea, yummy!  my grofriend got the fried chicken half order with red beans and rice and mac and cheese.  and i got the BBQ chicken half order with okra and potato salad.  Her fired chicken was good but the red beans and rice were kinda blah (meaning just ok.)  the BBQ chicken was falling off the bone good! and the okra was awesome.

in summary we recommend getting the half orders because its just too much freakin food!  

p.s. it was alot cleaner than i thought it would be.  its in a grody looking strip mall."}
{"text":"One of my favorite meals I had on my last trip to the city! Oxtails, sides and desserts were outstanding!  Ill be moving to town in a few months and I hope to become a regular :)"}
{"text":"We just happened to be going down the street and everyone in the car was hungry. We saw M&M Soul Food and decided to stop. We were all full when we left.

My daughter said the mac and cheese and fried chicken were good. I had the ox tails and loved them, they had a little more fat then I like, but were seasoned very well. The black eyed peas were a little too salty for my taste but good nonetheless.

I highly recommend this restaurant for some good soul food."}
{"text":"We recently visited this restaurant during our trip to Vegas. I was skeptical after reading so many reviews, but decided to give it a chance anyway. 

The service was great and the fried chicken was fried to perfection! 

We had the chicken and waffles and the 3 piece chicken wings with Mac and cheese, string beans and yams. Everything was delicious!! It was so tasty we went the next day for more chicken. Can't wait to return to Vegas and eat here again!"}
{"text":"My friends and I hit M&M whenever in Vegas, usually making time to eat there at least twice. I always order the fried chicken with fried okra, red beans & rice, and collared greens as sides on my first visit, and mix it up on the second visit. One friend always gets a bowl of gumbo (served only on weekends).

As a starter, the cornbread hotcakes are amazing.

I've never been disappointed by their chicken. It's perfect: not too dry, seasoned throughout, with a delicious crust. I suspect that they brine the chicken, since it has a nice, subtle flavor in the meat. It's some of the best fried chicken I've ever eaten, and judging by my shape I've eaten a lot of fried chicken. Per my friend who orders the gumbo, even after four years at Tulane he's never had a bowl of gumbo so flavorful and delicious, and once told our server that he'd put it up against any gumbo he had while in undergrad. The gumbo doesn't come with sides, but my friend likes the red beans & rice so much that he always orders a side with his gumbo.

M&M is on our permanent itinerary when visiting Vegas, much like hitting up In-N-Out for a burger and Trader Joe's to buy stuff for family & coworkers. The staff is friendly, the wait minimal, and food delicious. Prices for entrees with three sides are reasonable, and it's easy to get to, right on Charleston in a small strip mall. The only drawback is that they close relatively early for Vegas."}
{"text":"Better than Roscoe' s chicken and waffles in Cali. Very clean,  food was perfect!!!!!! Warm and inviting.  
Will recommend !!!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry but I grew up eating soul food plus I'm from Chicago where we have the best soul food restaurant every, shout out  MacArthurs miss ya!.  I was very disappointed.  The best thing I had was the cornbread hotcakes.  Just glad I had a coupon...."}
{"text":"After spending 3 days dining in pretentious Vegas restaurants is was great to eat somewhere that's great for what it is, the Ox-tails  were incredible.
The service was some of the friendliest we saw for our entire Vegas stay"}
{"text":"Probably the worst eating experience I've had while in Vegas. I'm sure they had to hatch the eggs raise the chicken then prepare the chicken in the amount of time it took for us to get our food. I had ribs mac and cheese and yams. My Wife had chicken, greens and mac and cheese. Sub par to say the least. I'm sure any where would be better than here. We had high hopes based on a personal recommendation, not sure what he based  his experience off of. From the wait to the food to the waitstaff this is not the place if you are any semblance of a hurry.  It took about 2 hours total to get seated and served. Gordon Ramsey would crap a brick if he came here. 1 star is being generous. I wouldn't recommend this place if even had a 2 for 1."}
{"text":"Amazing food, service and value for money! I had the smothered chicken with sides of cornbread dip and mac&cheese and it was soooo good!! We also loved that they gave us a free starter of cornbread pancakes... Absolutely yummy! I could eat those pancakes everyday! It's also rather reasonably priced as compared to all the restaurants in casinos. The service was great as well - our waitress was very friendly and attentive and our food was served within 10 minutes, but that could be because we had an early dinner at 5pm. It's quite conveniently located opposite the IHOP near the Stratosphere, so you could easily get there by taking the northbound monorail along the Strip! However, 2 of my friends had that and were rather disappointed by the small size of the fish, so I would definitely go for the chicken instead!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious yummmmmm!
But the service was HORRIBLE.....Being that myself and girlfriend are from out of town I felt they were completely biased seeing them serve \"4\" other families after we arrived 35 minutes prior to us being there....they never asked us if we were okay nor took into consideration for the wait or the food we ordered...never ask us if we were thirsty."}
{"text":"Found this gem on the recommendation of a good friend.  I've been trying to find some good Soul food, like my Mom used to cook.  Let me tell you, this is THE place.  Everything down to and especially the sweet tea, is spot on.  Friendly staff and a great atmosphere make this an ideal place for any displaced Southerner, or wanna be types.  

I had the smothered pork chops, collard greens, and fried okra.  Way more than enough food, especially for the price.  If all the dishes are equally as good as my first time fare, you will not be disappointed with your meal.  

Did I mention FRIENDLY staff?"}
{"text":"The food was 4stars, my experience was a zero star so I split the middle.

This place has been on my list due to southern fried chicken and sides.

I was greeted immediately and received great service throughout.  It was the the trickery of the menu that soured my taste.

I ordered the half order of 3 piece fried chicken. Waitress asked me if I wanted dark or white meat. I asked for a mix and she said sure. Menu says that white meat would be a $1 upcharge so I knew I'd likely see this on my bill.

Dish arrives with two pieces of chicken (1 leg and 1 wing) and my two sides. Why only 2 pieces? I thought maybe the \"half order\" was only two pieces so I went with the flow.

Chicken was great as were the sides (cornbread dressing and string beans).

I get bill with $1 upcharge for white meat so I tell waitress that I was charged $1 and only received 2 pieces, a leg and a wing.  She tells me that a wing is considered white meat. Dude, really? So bill was $11.88 after tax (without drink) for a leg a wing and two sides.

I certainly have the right to feel cheated in my opinion.

Won't be back."}
{"text":"The Chicken and Waffles were excellent, and the service had that Southern Charm. Great energy in the place for breakfast !"}
{"text":"This place had been recommended by a few different people and based on the reviews I went for it. I had the fried chicken with greens, rice and gravy and black eyed peas. The chicken was well fried but not seasoned. The greens were cooked well but I'm not a fan of greens with sugar in them. The rice wasn't salted when cooking and the gravy might have been from a jar. The peas and the corn bread were the best things on my plate. Prices were pretty average. Service was excellent. Might be willing to give a second shot."}
{"text":"Food is great! Service is 5 star! I had fried chicken, yams and string beans. Hubby had meatloaf, daughter had snapper and her hubby had oxtail. It was all 5 star quality . I highly recommend going."}

     Tasted my wifes fried okra very good seasoned well,waitress forgot about the okra and delivered after my wife ate her food,normally We would have  said forget and leave, but the wife was craving fried okra, that's y we came here,our first choice  catfish alley was closed. I'm thinking of deducting another star as I sit and wait for my ck. Yes I'm writing my review as I sit and wait and wait....... service here sucks.  If u come don't b in a rush cause service is in no rush, too bad food is really good."}
{"text":"We still remember the great dinner we had at M&M's when they were located on Jones and Harmon.  My wife ordered fried chicken and it was hugh (capon?) and good.  It was crispy on the outside, warm and moist on the inside.  She couldn't finish it all.  She now orders just a couple fried chicken wings for lunch ($1.50 each) at their relocated Charleston location.  Very good cornbread pancakes are brought to you when you are seated.  If you ask they will give you 2 more no charge.  We will definitely return to try other entrees.  Good collard greens and blackeye peas as sides.  Diner atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food was good. Price was fair. Service was lacking. I'm not a picky patron. I just get thirsty. I did not get offered a refill my entire meal. I got my refill when I asked for it when I received the check."}
{"text":"Slow service but the food was ok.  If the place is packed, how long would it take to get served?  I'm not sure I am willing to find out."}
{"text":"Felt like i was at home.... The staff was very nice and the food was great.... I definitely will be back next time in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"My friend and I encountered horrible service here. 

This occured on June 18th, 2011 my Vegas road mate decided to try out this place. So we walk in and were told to wait and we did so. Then we were seated with no menus, so we sat there just to see how long it would take before we were given a menu. 

The black bald head male waiter said he would give us a menu and he never did. Finally after a few minutes a waitress gives us our menu. Now usually when you are seated the waiter ask if you would like water or drinks. We were not ask this. 

Now as we are waiting a couple comes in and they are serviced before us! Then the bald head waiter who is a table behind us says 

\"Yall want a drink or something while Yall waiting?\"

Well I thought that was standard procedure from the start. We ended up leaving and going to Eggworks. 

kathys when it was open had Much better service, so sad that her place closed."}
{"text":"Are you freaking kidding me!!! I never like to write bad reviews however I could not pass this one up. I am from Chicago visiting Las Vegas and read the reviews about this food which seemed to be favorable. The food was so tasteless and unfulfilling. We order mac n cheese (must be velveeta- yuk) which was dry and separated. Greens favorless, Sweet potatoes not sweet and were very dry. Ordered baked chicken with dressing  (no dressing came home with my order), Fried okra (also was forgotten by the order taker).The side of green beans ($5.50) tasted like canned beans.  I was told that the catfish was just sub-par, nothing special. The rib looks to be dry.  This was soul food w/o any soul at all.  I am so disappointed.  I spent over $50.00 for three orders that I could have easily cooked myself but I am ill and needed food that was already prepared.  Would not recommend this place to anyone as I think the food was nasty and the service (order taker) was not fully capable of using her listening skills.

Oh and the corncakes tasted a little sweet.  Not to my liking!!!

Hopefully this was just a bad day in the middle of the week. Yikes!!!"}
{"text":"The new location on Las Vegas Blvd really needs a manager.  Someone with customer service skills to train and supervise the staff.   No one wants to patronize a business with nice-nasty people (people that pretend to be nice but comes off as nasty and really don't want to wait on you.).  They really need to train their staff better and have some respect and customer appreciation, if expecting to stay in business because the food is not all that.  At least at the Charleston location the staff is friendlier and the food is better.  I will give this location a second chance in a few months just to see if this is a serious business.  If they are so nonchalant and careless with their customers, I hate to see what the kitchen staff is like handling my food."}
{"text":"Thanks to other Yelpers here we found this amazing gem, my family and I thoroughly enjoyed our 1st family dinner here in Las Vegas.  The food is very authentic, scrumptious and absolute heaven for our taste buds.  The staff are very sweet, charming,friendly and very attentive to us; their smiles are genuine and an added bonus to our wonderful experience at M&M  . I am absolutely recommending this wonderful establishment."}
{"text":"Omg their corn bread is to die for. I ordered Smothered fried chicken with mash potatoes and red beans and rice, so delicious! To top it off our mother is so picky when it comes to any soul food restaurant, I was very shocked that she didn't have any complaints. Shout out to the Chefs! Lastly, our waitress Tashara was very sweet and accommodating."}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming here. The atmosphere, the food, the ambience, the customer service is just awesome. Every time I'm in town this is my go to spot for soul food. The people who work here have become my family. You should let them become yours."}
{"text":"First I must say that I am from the south so I was critical when I walked in. The place is nice and the staff looked nice in their bow ties and white collard shirts. I debated a long time and never once did I feel rushed to order. I ended up with the smothered pork chops, macaroni and cheese and collard greens. I also had the opportunity to try their sweet tea and peach cobbler.

Pork chop - Was on the smaller side, but very good flavor
Greens - Were okay, probably won't order again. A bit too sweet and over cooked for my taste My mom's collard greens have spoiled me. 
Macaroni - Again, it was okay, Not really cheesy or anything, but I would order again.
Cobbler - Way too sweet and was not warm when I got it
Sweet tea - was good, probably would have made it a bit sweeter, for the fact that they put ice in it

All in all, I would say their food is good. I understand that the taste of these items can change from day to day so this about my experience only. 

P.S. they are on the pricey side but the portions are reasonable, so I would say its worth the try."}
{"text":"Great food, fantastic service! Had the chicken and waffles.... Seriously some awesome waffles and crispy deep fried tasty chicken! Recommend to anyone who needs some comfort food."}
{"text":"Get it together M & M. Your food could be better don' t put BBQ chicken if you not going to BBQ the chicken. Just call it what it is baked chicken with store bought BBQ sauce. The cleanliness of your establishment could be waaay better. There are not that many joints out there like yours so be the best and fresh!!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious. Didn't have to wait that long, maybe 15 minutes to get our food. We got a full order of fried chicken and collard greens, mac and cheese and string beans. Also, half order of catfish and rice and beans. My only complaint about the fish was that was a bit too salty. Unlimited cool-aid. Chicken was reasonably priced at $12 and fish at $9.99. I would definitely go back there again! Staff was super pleasant, friendly and efficient:)"}
{"text":"Best soul food ever! I'm a good critic to the max and this place deserves it's stars. I usually have the bbq chicken with collard greens, mac n cheese and candied yams."}
{"text":"Shrimp and grits the shrimp was very small and dried out. The severs are all very vice but the food quality was not good."}
{"text":"Great food and great service, clean and professional as well. I proudly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Was looking for some soul food and found m&m driving past. People were standing outside so i thought this place should be good. There was a guy serving water in Dixie cups, make along story short we couldn't place an order  or receive any type of service.  I guess when they are busy , new customers dont mean anything . Wanted to do a phone order and the dude said email him later to place an order. So glad i didn't waste my money here after reading all the bad reviews,  just will wait to i get back home to California.  Horrible service beware!"}
{"text":"Second time coming to this location as usual the food was delicious. My only complaint is the waitress. She was rude, short like she was too busy i wont put her name out there. I got the snapper and catfish. The greens remind me of my grandmas and them corn cakes hot dammm.."}
{"text":"Good food, but portion sizes way too small for these prices. May be best to eat here early before they start running out of entrees."}
{"text":"Area isn't the best but food was good. Did not care for the sweet green. Fantastic"}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden gem in Vegas. The chicken and waffles was great. The muddy water was made with fresh lemonade and the red beans and rice was delicious. Great food and southern hospitality. Portions are big for the price and you will leave stuffed."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant as the husband was craving fried chicken.

The staff are extremely happy, polite, prompt and helpful.

We tried the fried chicken (both), mashed potatoes/gravy (both), macaroni and cheese (me), collard greens(him), and cornbread stuffing(him).

The cornbread pancakes  you get as you sit down are super tasty!!!
The fried chicken was cooked perfectly, we just wish it was seasoned a bit more.
Mashed potatoes/Gravy, they were okay but again lacking in seasoning.
Collard greens, according to the husband, absolutely fantastic.
Cornbread stuffing, unfortunately some of he worst he's had.
Macaroni and cheese, it was okay, but rather dry (could be because we got there just before closing).  Wish it had been creamier and a bit more seasoning.

We'll probably give it another try in the future."}
{"text":"Great food! We were looking for home cooked breakfast and found it! Creamy grits, good coffee and friendly service. Smooth R&B playing in the background set it off."}
{"text":"Although the servers were friendly enough, the kitchen was way too slow! I write this as I've been waiting 40 min for my dinner! Just heard they were out of many favorites too!!!"}
{"text":"we go here everytime we visit vegas, a matter of fact thats one of our highlights of our vegas trips, we accidentally discovered it one day while driving back to the telly from walmart, from the first visit to the last visit they all have been delicious, i always order the oxtails cause they are big, meaty and good, my wife orders different entrees each time and no complaints from her either, we just love the place! i also feel very safe eating there too cause they got \"zeus\" as armed security there, lol."}
{"text":"Every time I visit Las Vegas I eat here at least twice. The best southern soul food ever. Great menu with large portions. Super friendly staff and good prices. You have to try the muddy water (ice tea & lemonade mix). It comes in a mason jar!"}
{"text":"Great smothered chicken, fried chicken, collard greens were fabulous but the real finesse was when Tim the owner insisted we have some sweet potato pie. WOW the best ever! Everybody we met there was very nice, customers included. We have a feeling we will become regulars."}
{"text":"Came in for an early Monday night dinner.  Got seated right away. I had Cherry Kool-Aid to drink, and the first sip immediately brought me back to my childhood. I love how food/drink can do that to you. Unlimited refills, but $2.50 seemed expensive for just Kool-Aid. They serve cornbread... in pancake form! Kind of quirky at dinner but I like quirky and they were actually really good! 2 thin pancakes served on a plate per person. It already made me want to come back and try their breakfast menu. I ordered the BBQ Chicken (white meat, 1/2 portion) and it was delicious. The meat was really tender and fell right off the bone. I wouldn't say it was actually BBQ chicken, but rather chicken they made and poured some great BBQ sauce on top of. I just wished the portion was bigger for the price. All I had was a tiny breast and tiny wing under globs of sauce. My husband had the meatloaf (full platter, which is 2 slices instead of 1) which was very bland and unimpressive. As for sides, we liked the fried okra, yams (really sweet!), and rice & beans. The mac & cheese and black-eyed peas were just okay. I would've liked to have tried their dessert but we decided to save that for our next trip here.
The service was friendly and somewhat attentive.
This review wouldn't be complete without mentioning the huge security guard that manned the restaurant. I guess it might be considered a sketchy neighborhood (they close at 8pm - kinda early?) but I couldn't decide whether I felt safer or less safe with his presence. You couldn't help but notice the firearm on his belt in plain view."}
{"text":"American Southern food rarely gets better than what M&M serves.  Not everything qualifies as great, but I haven't had a bad dish yet.  The main dishes are (in my experience) always exceptional.  The fried chicken at M&M qualifies as some of the best I've had, along with the fried chicken at Hard Knox Cafe in San Francisco.

The ox tails, the liver and onions, etc. all rate far above similar dishes served almost anywhere else.  

The corn \"bread\" (really cornmeal pancakes) is really a treat.  The fried okra superb.  The collard greens are OK, the same with the black-eyed peas.  The macaroni and cheese is good enough, but nothing to write home about.

All in all, though, M&M deserves a five-star rating.  Not only do I recommend it, I eat there repeatedly."}
{"text":"This place was delicious! We were a party of 4 and we ordered the catfish, the fried pork chops smothered with gravy, the chicken wings, and the fried snapper. The food was slap yo mamma good and the red Kool Aid was on point. This place is definitely on my list to go back too!"}
{"text":"The only thing good about this restaraunt was the wait which was less than 20 minutes. Food was horrible. They were out of oxtails and greens and this was at 630 pm. While we were eating we seen other customers getting greens. Which we were told oh yeah we cooked some. The service was beyond horrible. The waitresses were loud,unprofessionsl very rude,talk with atitude and not very attentive. My son asked for a refill of coke and she brought back an ice tea. The waitress slammed our checked on the table. If i could i wouldn't give it a 1 star. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. The manager really needs to hire professional employees or give a customer service class to their current employees. Customer service skills is HORRIBLE!!!!!"}
{"text":"A bit over priced in my opinion but the food was very tasty. Homemade corn bread pancakes, fried okra, fried chicken and catfish, mashed potatoes and collard greens. Although the food is well seasoned, be sure to order water because it was quite salty.
The service was good and friendly, we got our food quickly but there weren't many other customers while we were there."}
{"text":"Pretty average breakfast. My table mates seemed to enjoy there's pretty well. The sweet tea is excellent. 

I had the sausage links, eggs, grits and biscuits. The sausage links were greasy and I couldn't finish them. Hey, probably my fault. I can't eat that stuff like I used too. The eggs were fine but either had too much butter or some cream or something in them. The biscuits were \"flat as a fritter\" and over cooked. It looked like they hadn't been proofed at all. 

The grits were flavorless and obviously had been sitting in a warm pan for a while. 

Staff was nice enough, but the place was dead on a Monday morning at 8:30 so they were just hanging out and BLASTING music. They did turn it down when asked. 

I've said this on other reviews, maybe I'm just being too hard on the Southern fare places. I'm a native Georgian and perhaps my hopes are too high. I WOULD give them another chance for lunch though, probably."}
{"text":"I was visiting from out of town and had a taste for soul food so I went to this nasty restaurant in the ghetto. DO NOT go to this dirty dump. I ordered sweet tea but it was more like water with sugar. The cornbread take like uncooked pancakes. My entree was disgusting even the gravy.  The waitresses were ghetto and rude. If I could give it a 0 I would."}
{"text":"The food is always good. But the service is dependent on your server. If
the server with the attitude is on, we order it to go. She seems preoccupied,
as if you're interrupting her very busy day. She's the exception rather than the rule, so all things considered, the quality of the food makes the occasional
take out option, seem like no bother at all. This is home cooking like I wished 
we'd had more of in the cafeterias of the schools I attended. The place is actually reminiscent of  a school cafeteria. The booths are upholstered in industrial orange plastic and the walls are painted the same kind of faded
yellow that is a staple of the Denny's motif. M and M is the only operational business
of the the dozen or so store fronts that were built in the 70's. The prosthetic limb place has closed. And unfortunately the garish display of mismatched
limbs(a wonderful way to spend the waining hours of an acid trip) that used to adorn the large window in the front of the store has moved on as well. The 
food is superb, but you'll have to bring your own  ambience with you."}
{"text":"Absolutely without a doubt the most disgusting fried chicken and mac and cheese I have ever eaten.  I am absolutely clueless to how this place got 4 stars let alone still in business! W.T.F is going???????????????? I rather go to KFC and deal with the diarrhea then step a foot in this place.  Horrible horrible horrible!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for soul food. Whenever I am in Vegas I try and make it a point to make it out there. The short ribs with bbq sauce is my favorite. The staff is very friendly. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Unprofessional & Lack of Customers Service was our experience. 
While I was visiting from California my friend & I yelped this location because we had a taste for soul food. I wish I could comment about a better experience, but unfortunately that's not the case.  One star is far more generous than I care to give. If I could give no stars at all I would. 
We walked in waited to be seated nearly 5 mins we were never acknowledged. My friend walked to the counter and asked if we could be seated. While approaching the counter employees were cursing, she asked if we could sit and she was told yes, sit anywhere. We sat towards the back. I noticed an employee walk in the door (maybe she was coming back from a break) there were 2 guys and a lady with her, she seated them and as she passed our table she said \"I'll be right with you\". Maybe I'm she was talking to the table she just seated nevertheless she seen us. At that point I decided to give them the benifi"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food at this place...but the sevice SUCKS!!!!!! Thank goodness the food keeps me coming back. This is the best soul food place in Las Vegas.  There are alot of imitators but they can never duplicate M&Ms."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to M & M soul food on a Monday morning (11 am) during a Vegas getaway. We were staying at the Stratosphere Hotel across the street so it was very convenient.  I ordered the fried chicken, collard green and yams...everything was hot and delicious. My boyfriend ordered the smothered chicken, collard greens, yams and macaroni & cheese. His food was also hot and delicious, except for the macaroni & cheese...the waitress informed us after serving my food that the \"noodle truck\" was just arriving and that the mac & cheese would have to be swapped for another side item. My boyfriend chose the rice and beans instead, which was luke warm and bland. The table next to us was offered free drinks since they also had to swap out their side items...we were not offered the same deal. Overall the food was good and the service was good but hopefully in the future they will schedule their \"noodle truck\" to arrive before they begin serving lunch."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Our waitress Jerria was the best. Wish we had M&M in sacramento.  Wonderful experience!!!"}
{"text":"First let me say the staff was always smiling but... the service was horrible.  The food was okay. We started off terrible because I have twin 2 year olds and they only had one high chair in the whole place.  I was meeting a group of ladies and told them just bring the one while I waited at the door.  After 5 minutes I asked again and another staff member informed me they just had one and I told them that was fine and that I was sitting with the group right by the door.  After another five minutes I decided to go to the bar and asked for someone to bring out the high chair which they again informed me of the one and they finally did.  After all that, the one chair was broken and so I had them take it back.  Then since I was joining the ladies already in progress I waited for a waitress.  After never getting one I went to the bar and ordered the food with the first person I could get, then when they brought it I had to go back to the bar and ask for a drink and silverware. After finishing I went back to the bar and asked for the bill.  We paid and left.  The one good thing is we were right at the door and right by the bar so getting someone was always easy and they always had a smile and responded.  The bad thing is I always had to initiate everything.  Unfortunately I'll never go back to this location but I have been to the other location with three babies and got excellent service with high chairs in excellent condition."}
{"text":"The food is okay! The greens were sweet, mac and cheese was box Mac and cheese and even though they we good the oxtails were not meaty at all.

As far as the service, very slow and the waitress hardly ever came back to the table to check on us!

I would only recommend the breakfast!"}
{"text":"i love there cornbread pancake! MMM
i had the smothered fried chicken with green bean and fried okra. i didn't really liked the green been but fried okra and chicken was MMM good. i also got the peach cobbler...that was really really sweet. i could almost taste grains of sugar on my palette. the food took a while... but it did say on the menu there can be up to 20 min wait for any fried food. our waitress was a sweetheart i'm gonna be back here SOON"}
{"text":"First time eating at m&m soul food at Charleston location 3/14/16 I heard a lot of good stuff about the place read a lot of reviews most were good so I decided to give it shot...Never Again...very disappointed walk in place had a good southern feel to it...waitress took my didn't take long...I order catfish and bbq ribs first off way over priced second Quality of food was not good they brought me out 2 pieces of fatty so called ribs in gravy not bbq sides where horrible Mac an cheese they used lawry's seasoning salt on it potato salad bad yams no flavor mashed potatoes gravy bad  only thing that was decent was catfish I will never eat at this place or recommend it nobody."}
{"text":"There was no hostess to greet us when we arrived. We were seated after about 20 minutes. There was some type of mix up with our food. Everybody's plate at my table arrived at different times with missing items. It took about another 30-40 minutes to get our food. Once we received all of the food it was delicious, i will give them props for that. But, I probably won't return again."}
{"text":"We went near closing time, which was a major mistake. The short ribs were old which they tried to disguise with the gravy. (They also had the audacity to place two bones without meat on the plate.) The end result was a tummy ache and a night on the throne. The hot water cornbread was cold. However, the fruit punch Kool-aid was cold, sweet, and refreshing."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Excellent service and yummy yummy food!  I had the smothered chicken greens and Mac and cheese and my boyfriend had the barbecue chicken with fried okra and red beans and rice.  Our server was great, friendly and quick!  Everything was bomb.com!"}
{"text":"Greetings to all again! Last night i experienced another vivacious meal... It started with my well mannered, professional & i might add beautiful waitress \"adree\" i hade the smothered chicken & catfish. My meal arrived to my table as alway's hot & fresh! I will alway's give my favorite soul food spot two thumb's up for the excellent service and i might add as well the place is alway's clean and the music is relaxing! I just want to thank all of the staff for displaying professional service again & again thank you! I \" highly\" recommend you get up and plan for a time that you will never regret at m&m's soul food on the strip very tasty!"}
{"text":"I cant believe I waited so long to try this place. From the outside it doesn't look like much, but once you step through the door, its a pleasant surprise. The first thing I noticed was how happy all the customers were. This is one of those restaurants that make sure solo diners don't feel awkward. I was one of three people dining alone. My server Tonika was friendly and  I took her suggestion of the half order of oxtails. I chose the blackeyed peas and collards as my sides. It was the perfect portion size for lunch. The food was delicious and I left feeling well fed and treated like family. I can't wait to come back and try the catfish!"}
{"text":"Tremendous soul food restaurant.  I am especially a catfish lover, and M&M has the best catfish I have ever eaten. I also love what they call cornbread there that is served with every order but it's interesting that it resembles a small pancake...you get two of them with your order. All servers are friendly.  I strongly recommend this place if you have a desire at some point for soul food."}
{"text":"Considering how much I've heard people rave about this place I really expected a lot better.  Prices are too high for mostly average soul food.  I'm from Los Angeles and have eaten at the original M&M Soul Food restaurant and at Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles - both were/are better.  It's been a few years since I've had Roscoe's so don't remember their prices, however I do remember being very happy about everything whenever I ate there.  Can't say the same for this M & M.  I learned how to cook from my Louisiana born and raised mother and grandmothers' and I can prepare most of these dishes (esp. the mac 'n' cheese, fried chicken, greens, liver and onions) better than this place.  Outrageous prices for the drinks too.  Plan on checking out a couple of other soul food restaurants I've heard about because I won't be returning to M & M.
The decor is uninviting."}
{"text":"I wish we were allowed to put half stars because I don't want to give them a 3 because they are better than that, but not quite a 4, but I'll go with that for now.  Finally had a chance to try it out and the vibe was really cool in there...I felt like I was thrown back into the 70's in DC eating at a place on North Capitol Street or Florida Ave....very cool!  

We were greeted by a very nice waitress and given our plates of corn cakes...which kept coming out as soon as we finished them.  I ordered the baked chicken with stuffing and string beans.  My one big disappointment was the beans tasting like they came out of a can.  My seatmates ordered ox tails, smothered fried chicken and catfish.  They each ordered the mac and cheese but said it wasn't that great.  I don't know for sure because I don't dig that stuff myself, but it's interesting that all three said they didn't care for it.

I'd like to go back for breakfast and would be willing to try for lunch again.  As I said, 4? No.  3? No, but solid 3.5."}
{"text":"First, everone who works here are the nicest group of people. My husband an I shared a full order of fried chicken and ribs. With each full order you get three sides which were all amazing! 
If you're looking for great soul food, this is the place.
We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Crunchy and juicy fried chicken which was tasty. Greens, made to what I imagine them to taste like. Black Eyed peas fantastic too! Wanted to go back but being from Chicago, chance was slim. Would go back when in Vegas again. Worth it. Price for amount of food can't be beat."}
{"text":"If I can give this place a 0 star I would. Let me start off by saying the service is horrible here. I took my little family here and ordered the food and it took them almost an hour to get are food served. The people that came after us got served before us. What's up with that M&M?!? I ordered oxtail which is really all fat and greasy and my wife ordered fries for my kids and that came last and had to ask the waitress like couple of times. The waitress never took care of us or checked up on us to see if we need anything. They are even lucky I tipped them $5 which I felt like they didn't deserve one at all and still got a dirty look after we left. I'm NEVER going back there since there is plenty of BETTER places to eat in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I will give it two stars since im writing about 2 different experiences. If I was only writing about my horrible experience I would give 0 stars.

The first time my husband and I went here it was good. The waitress we got was very nice and our food was hot. We enjoyed ourselves.

Second time we went our friend was in town so we thought to take him here. Big mistake. Our waitress was a different woman than the first time and so rude. She acted as if we were bothering her by putting our order in , we received our food cold and never checked on us once. She was real nice when she came to bring us the check though.

I love soul food but will never go back because of my last experience I was so embarassed that we took our friend there."}
{"text":"I have been here more than 10 times in the past few years and their food has always been 5 out of 5 stars - the best. The service is fast and friendly, the food has been consistently fantastic, and the price is very reasonable. Do not let their red beans and rice miss ya!"}
{"text":"The gumbo the  sides the smothered chicken every time I'm in vegas i pay this soul food spot a visit food is great staff is cool"}
{"text":"We love to experience local restaurants when we travel and gave this place a try. From a business point of view its a shame the owner or manager does not take notice of the reviews regarding the service and get organized...whatever $$ they are makin could easily be double or triple of what they are currently bring in. We came in and put our name down on the waiting list and waited while the waitress would ask who was nxt instead of going from the list of names...from there once we were seated we now waited over an hour for our food....in tht time we saw the waitress hosting and seating customers....busing tables and serving food....it was total chaos...once our food came it was medium warm but pretty good.... coming from Los Angeles where the food scene if jumping this type of service wld not survive with all the competition.....tht being sd as a business owner help your community...hire some locals to bus and host and let ur servers do what they need to do to tend to your customers...get it together and i'm sure you will reap the benefits"}
{"text":"Service is WONDERFUL....I had the pleasure of having the Yelp famous Tashara as our waitress and she is a SWEETHEART!!! The food was good but not mindblowing....but THE BEST SOUL FOOD PLACE IN VEGAS."}
{"text":"We finally visited, after 2 years of hearing rave reviews, and I'm never leaving!  We had an amazing breakfast of corned beef hash, pork chops (mouth-watering tender inside a crispy breading) rice and gravy and grits. I'm back this afternoon for Gumbo (only on the weekend), greens, yams, black-eyed peas and cornbread.  It's crowded, lively, entertaining and delicious!  Service is attentive but they are so busy it can be a bit slow.  Still - I'm never leaving!"}
{"text":"Friendly finger burnin' good.  Tim, Owner, runs a tight ship crewed by friendly and considerate people, especially Malika.  The reason I call the food finger burnin' good is that I was literally burning my fingertips in between bites of what is the best friend chicken I've ever eaten because I couldn't wait for it to cool down.  

When living in LA, I went to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles on Pico (http://www.yelp.com/biz/roscoes-house-of-chicken-and-waffles-los-angeles).  This place is much better.  Even went back again a second time with the wife on our weekend in Vegas.  Skip the overblown buffets and eat something real!"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely good. And the service is even better. Our waitress Yana was outstanding! Her multi tasking skills is a 10. Next time in Las Vegas I will be back."}
{"text":"We came in on a Friday night around 8pm, 2 hours before they closed. We sat to order the server says we are out of Greens, string beans, cabbage and Oxtails. I said are you serious she says yep we are out of everything green. This was a problem because one person in our party could only eat the vegetables and meat no carbs. Since we didnt expect them to be out of lots of things we didnt have an alternate plan so we stayed. We waited and finally recieved the cornbread, I asked for butter and you guessed it they were out.. What the????  We finally got our food at 8:58.. worst experience ever. So sad cause we were so excited to eat here..."}
{"text":"We were unsure after reading reviews, but we are so happy we gave it a try!! If you think you are coming to a fancy establishment then don't come! This is a down home diner with amazing food! The shrimp and grits was delicious, the smothered fried chicken with world famous gravy was AMAZING!! We are now aware of why it is world famous!! Our server was great. Will be coming back, maybe tomorrow lol!!"}
{"text":"OXTAILS! OXTAILS! oxtails and gravy over rice is the bomb diggity ya heard! i always come to this place at least twice when iam in Vegas"}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for our Valentines day after a long time craving for soul food. The resturant  was very quiet that night only four patrons.  We were served corn bread in pancake style immediately as we were seated. The food was more than phenomenal!!!!!!! I got smothered fried chicken  O M Goodness !!!! My husbamd got fried chixken he said O M Giodneas as well.. The only thing  that will be best when the sides are little bigger since it was served in small bowl. Dont allow that be a negative.  They also serve breakfast when we saw the menu..  We still cant get over how DELICIOUS the meal was !! ORDER muddywater which  was half lemonade and iced tea soo Phenomenal delicious!!! WE WILL BE BACK SOONER THAN WE THINK !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant for some shrimp and grits... Waited over and hour for my order.  This meal was the worst I have ever had.  I doused it with salt and the server asked if i wanted some butter, I said I would but, she came back and said they didn't have any butter..  If the shrimp and grits were worth the wait it would have been great but, these shrimp and grits wouldn't have been worth waiting for 5 minutes."}
{"text":"Great food! Nice little stop when in Vegas for good soul food! Great greens and good can and waffles! Must try for the ice tea!"}
{"text":"Welllllll. After sitting for about a half an hour to be told that my party and I had to sign OUR own selves in, we finally got seated 20 minutes later to only sit another 27 minutes to order our food. Food came about 30 minutes later which was some bomb ass catfish that wasn't enough. With some bomb ass muddy water and potatoes. Dnt order grits, they're inconsistent. Bring patience !"}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant...took an hour for to go order to be ready...every 15 minutes I was told they were out of something I ordered...Food was ok but not worth the wait and anxiety..."}
{"text":"I have driven by here everyday for the last year wanting to go in because I'm a country boy from Oklahoma and I love me some soul food! Last night a buddy and I were looking for someplace to eat and I decided this place would be great. 
I ordered the fried chicken (white meat) with sides of fried okra,red beans and rice and the mac and cheese with iced non sweet tea and my buddy got the smothered chicken with the same sides. The menu says to allow 20 minutes for fried foods. ( That right there means it's all prepared FRESH!)
The waitresses here are absolutely the nicest servers I have encountered in Las Vegas thus far! 
They first seat you and bring you out corn bread like I've never seen before. I'm used to skillet style cornbread and they brought us out some little cornbread pancakes. We ate ours so quick that the waitress brought us more and she said we should put honey on them, which we did and dadgum it was AMAZING! Once we got our food the sides were in little bowls on a plate to keep them seperated. Then came the chicken. Once I put that food in my mouth, the only things I could keep doing were giggling like a child, shaking my head and repeatedly saying\"Mmmmm dam%it!\"
That cornbread breading on the fried okra and the chicken was like sex in my mouth! The only thing I wasn't really a fan of was the mac and cheese, but I still ate it and cleaned those Mo Fo'in plates up! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because they close at 8pm....If you want some good soul food or just dang good grub, CHECK THIS PLACE OUT!"}
{"text":"This place was great. We got huge breakfasts, meat, eggs, potatoes, and biscuits (which they fried on the grill!) For only about $12. All was delicious!!! Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Lunch.  Arrived at 12:09.  I was the 10th customer  and all but one table had been served.  Ordered immediately,  1/2 smothered dark chicken w Ocracoke and greens and a Dr Pepper. 

Store was clean, wait staff prompt.

12:14 - hot cornbread pancakes. Great start.  I appreciate the fact they make it per customer.   Doesn't sit and dry out. 12:18.  She had to bring me more.  ;-)

12:19 lunch served.  

Sides great.  Chicken flavor is great. First piece of chicken is slightly overcooked but I pull most of the skin off anyway. Second piece is on target.  Could be the way they like to eat/prepare it.

Waitress forgot my Dr. Pepper but I didn't bring it up.  Two more tables had come in and I really didn't need it.

I'd come back.  May try other location to compare.

My soda is on the bill.  Evidently the bill wasn't checked.  Happily changed the bill."}
{"text":"OMG.. I can not believe that I did not do a review on this place any sooner. I went a few months ago with my aunt. LOVED IT. I had a 2 piece dark chicken meal that came with sweet potatoes, macaroni and cheese, greens, and some cornbread. I also had their lemonade. OMG.. I thought I was in heaven once again. I love adding hot sauce to some greens.. Their greens were DELICIOUS along with the mac & cheese and the cornbread. The lemonade was the sweetest lemonade that I have ever tasted!! Believe it or not, we went during the meal times when it was $5. I give M&M two thumbs up and Highly recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing. I went 2 times so far and although the second time I opted for the fried chicken that ended up not being good, the rest of it was. Just skip the fried chicken and go with the country fried, meatloaf, chitlins, and catfish which are all good."}
{"text":"Our first attempt to patronize this establishment was on Sunday evening. We were greeted outside by other patrons who told us that the wait was around two hours long. They also said the food was not worth the wait. They said their mother cooked better food. We went inside and saw how many people were sitting around like they were waiting to be seated and decided to go elsewhere. Monday afternoon we tried again. This time we walked in but wasn't sure where to go because no one greeted us at the door. We saw people sitting in chairs that looked like they were waiting to be seated so we asked them what we were supposed to be doing. They were actually there for job interviews so they didn't know. One man behind the bar did tell me that he would be with me after he waited a table. But he never came back. Someone who was dressed up and look like they may be a manager or owner asked me if I had been helped yet. I told her no and she quickly got someone. She thought I was there for a job interview at first. We were given menus and told we could sit anywhere we wanted. We ordered Chicken and Waffles and had muddy water drinks. I'll have to rate the chicken and waffles at three stars. The chicken was fried well but not seasoned any particular way. Didn't have any type of flavor that would make you remember it. The waffle sort of tasted like gingerbread. Not sure but it wasn't awesome. It was just okay. The waitress was nice. The establishment itself was a little grungy and could use a facelift. There was a friendly gentleman who seemed to be an owner or manager that kept going around to different tables speaking with people to see how they were doing or if they liked the food. Overall I'd say this place isn't really worth the time it takes to get your food. It offers average food and a medicore dining experience."}
{"text":"I must start by saying that I am one who is prone to wandering. A former GF would say nosy, but I prefer to think I'm observant. At any rate, I am driving down the street (wandering after my trip to WalMart) and see a rather unremarkble place with a red sign-- M&M Soul Food. 

Now I'm driving a full size dually pickup with CA plates, so I'm not about to drive over the median like Myke R. So as I'm driving around the block, I'm thinking that it's a bit early for dinner and maybe I should keep driving. But I live in LA, so when will I have another opportunity? Indeed.  

As I walk through the door, I am welcomed by a man who I think is a patron sitting at the counter. He invites me to have a seat anywhere. Odd, but still, I'm thinking \"what a great place where patrons welcome each other...\" Further observation leads me to believe that he may be the manager but I'm not sure. Sittling beside him is the armed gentleman that Teri C. mentioned. Being a gun guy, I recognize the make and model of his pistol; what I find odd is that he's wearing a red and blue muscle shirt and baggy pants. WTF-- that's no security uniform I've ever heard of. Odd, but not intimidating.

So I order a fried pork chop (half order-- it's a bit early for my dinner, remember) with mac & cheese and red beans & rice and a sweet tea. My waitress brought me a couple of corn bread pancakes, sort of like hushpuppies that got smashed. My pork chop comes rather quickly, definitely less than 20 minutes mentioned. I've never had fried pork chops like this, and it was good! Nice flavor, cooked through, yet still juicy. 

The red beans & rice were unremarkable, but is that a bad thing? I like red beans & rice and I liked them here. Mac & cheese is a different story. People can be very particular about mac & cheese-- cheese was good but mac was too mushy for me. 

Since this was not really a dinner, I didn't order a dessert. I'm intrigued enough to come back to try the ox tails, short ribs, sweet potato pie and banana pudding!"}
{"text":"Great food, healthy portions.  Always enough to take home.  I had oxtails witg greens, macaroni, yams and their specialized cool aid.  Food came out quick and hot.  Waitress was nice and accomodating.  They accepted my restautant.com coupon with no problem.  Unlike the other Soul food restaurant called Southern style eatery.  Food was 100 times better.  Will always come back when visiting Vegas.  Loved, loved loved it!"}
{"text":"I ate here a couple of times and food was excellent and the service was awesome!! I love love their oxtails. seasoned perfectly."}
{"text":"My cousin and her husband were in town and we decided to eat here for lunch before they got back on the road.  I have heard great things and not so great things about this place but I decided to try it out anyways.

For some reason half of the restaurant was hot and while the other half was nice and cool.  After awhile it began to feel uncomfortable.  My cousin and her husband were already seated and waiting for me to arrive.  Once I came, it took the server awhile to come and ask for my drink order.  My cousin's glass of water was empty and you would of thought she would have refilled it when she brought me my drink but she didn't.  She gave us more than enough time to look over the menu.  We ordered and the food took forever to come out, but we were okay with that.

I ordered the half size cat fish plate which came with two sides.  The fish and mac and cheese tasted great but I didn't too much care for their collard greens because they must have had sugar in them.

I would have given it 2.5 stars but it wouldn't let me.  I'm real big on service and my server wasn't the best.  She never came back to check on us and we had to flag down another server twice.  I planned on ordering dessert but she never even came back to ask if we wanted any, so I didn't bother getting any.  While waiting to pay for our food, our server and one of the cooks decided to argue about orders out loud and super unprofessional.  We asked another server if she could just check us out but she said ours had to be the one to do it.  She called out to her two separate times to get her to help us.  She finally came and gave us the bill and didn't even thank us.  

I understand we all have good and bad days at work, but you definitely shouldn't let it effect your attitude especially when you're working in the food service industry."}
{"text":"Waited an hour and 15 minutes only to get our food and for it to be luke warm. I was expecting burning hot food for the wait. Service was slow. Pork chop was tough for the butter knife we were given and the snapper tasted like oven fish sticks. The kool-aid and the muddy water was the only thing decent."}
{"text":"This is the best soul food restaurant I've eaten in.  They fix the best red beans and rice ... So much so that I'm thinking of ordering a take out order for today!  
I had the baked chicken which came smothered with M and M's signature chicken gravy- it was extremely well prepared and was \"fall off the bone\" good!  

They bring out their signature  cornmeal pancakes with every order which is by itself incredible!  
I am looking forward to my next visit and plotting a plan on how to get this restaurant closer to home!"}
{"text":"If you want Soulfood, you'll get it here.  It may not be my Grandmas cooking, but gotta someone else's Grandma's cooking, because of the home cooked taste of the food. I need to go back and try other items on the menu, But I had the Fried Chicken Cornbread, Collard Greens, and the Mac'n Cheese. So good.  I gotta go back."}
{"text":"I'm from the south and this food is so authentic and delicious! It reminded me so much of the food my late grandmother used to cook for me I almost started to cry! Great service and the corn muffin pancakes are addictive."}
{"text":"We were craving some soul food but were a bit disappointed with M & M. First of all, they are extremely slow and it took forever to get our food. The servers weren't the most attentive. Then, the food was bland without much flavor. I got the short ribs and had to salt them to add some flavor. There was hardly any meat on them, too. I tried my sister-n-law's mac and that wasn't bad. We both didn't care for the greens, though. It had too much of a vinegary taste. We did like their free corn cakes, and I liked the menu with home-style southern foods. My sister-n-law had been to the M & M in L.A. and loved it, so we had high expectations but were let down. I might still be willing to give it a try since I saw other things on the menu that sounded good."}
{"text":"I love me some good soul food, but M&M didn't do it for me. The service was extremely slow. It took a while for someone to take our order and then forever for our food to come out. To make it worse, they just weren't that attentive. The food was just OK and a bit flavorless. The greens, which I normally love, was a bit to vinegary. The only thing I liked were the corn pancakes that they gave to us as an appetizer. My sister-n-law raved about this place, but it was the one in L.A. that she visited. This one was very different, and we left us unimpressed."}
{"text":"Went around 11:30 this morning. We weren't greeted either but the staff was really nice once we were seated. Horrible coffee. My wings were greasy. The waffles were good. I like the other location much better."}
{"text":"Really Outstanding fried chicken! Staff were welcoming, kind and super fast. The final star was deducted for the sides. Good, but not spectacular. I would not order the dressing. The cornbread pancakes were delish. Go for those and the muddy water, and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is Awesome! When you sit down ask for bread (tip from our waitress) their little cornbread pancakes are super tasty.
We ordered the ox tail and it was super tender and flavorful. We also tried the smother fried chicken it was tasty. But our favorite has to be the fried catfish, soooo glad we got it a la carte to try so flavorful. The batter was perfectly seasoned. The fried okra was delish too. It was definitely worth the trip off strip to try =)

I was very sad that I didn't wake up early enough to try the chicken and waffles, next time.... We will be back!"}
{"text":"The best thing I had was the yams and hot water cornbread. The fried chicken which was smothered in gravy was not only dry but HARD. I also had the rice and gravy which didnt have any taste but Hey it's rice. The cabbage was bland and soft.  My wifey had the fried pork chops which was actually pretty good but basic. The greens were extremely bitter to the taste.  Our service was mediocre. We advised her that we needed a refill on water before the Mason jar was empty. As I watched her gossip with another server for 5-10 mind I kindly gave my girl the rest of my water as I was already annoyed with my food.  She later came over dropped off water and check. Had this place been busy she might have gotten a tip but considering we was her only table...  That service wasnt acceptable. I wouldn't recommend this to my neighbors dog."}
{"text":"Family and I came here from SLC. Yelp reviews complained about the service. It only took about 5 minutes to get sat down, friendly staff, and fantastic food. I highly recommend this place if you like southern/soul cooking. Fried chicken is perfection. Greens were fantastic and hot sauce on the table. My kinda place."}
{"text":"I went here last week with a friend.  The waitress got us started with the complimentary cornbread pancakes, which we smeared with butter.  We couldn't believe how tasty they were.  

I got a half order of the fried chicken with sides of collard greens and red beans & rice.  The chicken was well-seasoned, crispy on the outside and tender inside.  It was very delicious.  I also enjoyed the sides, but didn't think there was anything special about them.

For a beverage, I couldn't decide between the sweet tea and the lemonade, so I got the muddy water, which is a mix of the two.  That was refreshing.

I once met a guy from Tuscaloosa who raved about how much he loved banana pudding.  I never had banana pudding before, so when I saw it on the menu, I had to try it.  Now I know why that guy liked banana pudding so much.  It was insanely delicious!  

I felt the service was adequate and the diner-style atmosphere was fitting for a soul food joint.  I would definitely return to this place:  good fried chicken, yummy corn cakes, heavenly banana pudding."}
{"text":"Ummm I guess it's good for Las Vegas soul food. I guess. The koolaid was just stupid sweet, like dummy sweet. And I like my koolaid sweet but this was way too extra. The baked chicken was regular, the meatloaf was regular, the Mac n cheese was sad... It wasn't even baked. So your koolaid taste like instant tooth rot but your Mac is like Betty Crocker Walmart. Come on son"}
{"text":"We ate at M&M's on 8/3/17.  The best thing on the menu was the little corn pancake.  We ordered  greens, yams, mac & cheese and fried fish and fried chicken.  The food lacked seasoning.  The yams were just overly sweeten, again without any seasoning. The greens had so many stems in them, I could not enjoy them.  The mac & cheese - bland..  Chicken.. so-so

Not sure what happened... the food used to be better.  I would not go back :("}
{"text":"I took my sister to Las Vegas for her birthday.  We are both from the South.  We wanted some true soul food and we definitely got it at M&M Soul Food.  Starting with the cornbread fritters to liver and onions, rice greens and rice...Yum Yum!  Oh and sweet ice tea...
Prinscia our waitress was awesome!
We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"You can get some serious soul food in Vegas.
The girls that work here are really funny and nice.
Ox tail and fried chicken.
Kool-Aid.
Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"After living in Las Vegas for a few years (way back), I finally got to try this place out tonight. I'm upset I never came here sooner and now I have to head back home to Washington tomorrow. The food here is stick-to-your-ribs and will leave you so full that you will want to curl up into a ball and take a long nap. 

Get the Muddy Water (tea & lemonade). So good! The corn cakes that come at the beginning of the meal is complimentary and is much better than any place that tends to serve dry cornbread. The fried chicken breast was moist with a perfectly seasoned crispy skin. The porkchop is a must when coming here. We decided to get it fried and not smothered, but added a side of gravy so we can dip it in. I hear just getting them smothered is just fine, but I personally like having the porkchops arrive crispy initially and then dunk it in sauce.

Only things I didn't really care for was the fried catfish and mac & cheese. The catfish was good, but not great to me, but overall was just not a fan of the mac & cheese unfortunately. Overall, the server was very friendly and personable. Whenever I am back in town, I will be stopping back again for those succulent porkchops and fried chicken."}
{"text":"When ever I am in Vegas, this is where I go for my soul food.  It is better than a lot of places in the SF Bay Area.

The fried foods take awhile to cook.  Menu says 20 minutes.  It is worth the wait.  I enjoyed eating all the food that we ordered, including the fried chicken, catfish (how do they keep it so moist and not overcooked?), and cornbread pancakes.  The weekend gumbo was delicious.  I would have preferred less liquid and more ingredients, otherwise I would also order this again.

All the side dishes I sampled had good flavor.

Tim, the owner, came around multiple times to check on us.  The waitress, Timakah (sp?), was friendly and personable."}
{"text":"I have had spotty service here in the past, but this Saturday it was spot-on. And the food was even better than I remembered.

My husband and I were in the mood for some comfort food, and M&M was mmm mmm good. He had smothered chicken (two legs and a thigh) with fried okra, mac and cheese, and mashed potatoes and gravy. I had meatloaf with fried okra, black-eyed peas, and red beans and rice. Enough food here for hearty leftovers, and we barely touched the corn cakes they serve in place of bread.

There's a huge menu, and they offer lots of half orders (with two sides) in case you're not that hungry. My only gripe is that I had a BOGO coupon from the Entertainment book, and our waitress said they didn't take coupons on the weekend. Didn't say that on the coupon or in the book, so good thing we had a credit card to pay our bill!"}
{"text":"Staff is horrible the wait is always so long. The staff is rude and ghetto as fuk!!!! They make u wait to sit down then wait to order drinks then wait to order food then wait a to get the food. I asked for service three times before someone took my drink order!! Then I get my food and it's the wrong order and it's cold!"}
{"text":"Upon arrival no proper greeting; no ventilation. Our family didn't receive good customer service so we left and will not return"}
{"text":"Upon arrival no proper greeting; no ventilation. Our family didn't receive good customer service so we left and will not return"}
{"text":"So this place came highly recommended by my husband's friend. Warning- this location is in the hood. When we first walked in, you have to wait to be seated and there was security by the door. So getting past all of that, we were seated and served right away. I tried the muddy water and it was good but the koolaid is delicious.... By far the best drink. I had the catfish with collard greens, mac & cheese and potato salad. The sides were all really good but the fish was fried a little hard for my tastes. It was still good though. Overall a decent place to v"}
{"text":"With not many soul food avenues in Las Vegas. This is definitely one of the best. From their fried chicken to their macaroni. Definitely a Must VISIT!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by how delicious the food is here! Southern style fried chicken is very flavorful, served fresh out of the fryer with minimal fat. Fried okra and Mac and cheese are also delicious. They also serve complimentary cornbread and it's fluffy and not too dense or sweet. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This was one of my faves once, but slipped a tad. Still good, but not quite like it was"}
{"text":"They were very busy when we got there but friendly waitress and delicious southern cooking worth the wait.  Oxtail, shrimp and grits, and hot cakes our favorite!"}
{"text":"I so much wanted to like this place. However, the food was awful and service was pathetic. I should have left when I realized it was taking so long for my food to arrive. About thirty minutes after placing my order I inquired about the whereabouts of my food. One would think that an order of shrimp and grits would be a quick preparation. Well, I finally got a bowl of bland instant grits, warmed up salad shrimp, and a few sprinkles of something green on top. Even salt and pepper couldn't spice this flavorless dish up. Yes, those were the only ingredients!

Service was as horrible as the food. The waiter stopped by once to ask if I was okay. As soon as I looked up to answer, he turned his back and walked over to another table.

Also, I do know the place is small, but please I ask you; why would you abruptly remove a chair from my table and scratch my feet in an effort to accommodate a party of about twenty folks? Yes, my table was now in the middle of that huge party! Those people looked at me sitting in the mist of their party as if I were an alien invader, because my table was literally in the middle of their tables. I will never go back to this place again! I should have known not to believe I was getting soul food in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Hate to say it but the quality of food has declined.  The food was barely warm, the smothered baked chicken (was truly smothered) was tough- thank goodness for the gravy, and the black eye peas were cold.  Service has declined too!  

BUT the Red Kool-aid was on point"}
{"text":"Who would've thought that there would be soulfood in Vegas this good. I had the half fried chicken plate with cabbage and mac n cheese. It looks like an old school hole in the wall, but it is very modern and nice on the inside. The service was great and the food was fantastic. The cornbread that comes with your meal was just ok. I liked that they were shaped like pancakes, however, it would have been great with sweett butter since the cornbread was bland. I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Best part of this adventure was the waitress, she was very nice and accommodating! However, the pork chop needed a little more seasoning. Please tell me why someone who appeared to be perhaps the owner, was delivering supplies at 9:55 am and they open at 10. We were served grits from yesterday, as you can see they are not creamy and have many chunks. I really want to support black owned businesses, but ppl please we gotta do better. Food wait was super long, but glad we got our food first, even though we arrived at opening (10 am) we received our food around 11 -Mind you, we ordered as soon as we arrived. I have many ideas for positive improvements m and m, please contact me!"}
{"text":"Just wish there was no restriction on the time for breakfast and lunch menu. Came here around 1030am and when you're in vegas breakfast lunch dinner doesn't matter what time.. We waited so long for our order to be taken and all along no one told us it's only breakfast. Won't be coming back to this location right next to stratosphere. I rather go to the other one I like the vibe and people at the other location better. 

Aftwe we got our food ..
We order the chicken & waffle and catfish .. one word. Bomb !! Lol so good. 1 star less because of the breakfast and lunch restriction. I still prefer the other location"}
{"text":"Was in Vegas visiting family last July 2015 . I had to stop in and show my 11 yr old daughter what my fuss was all about at M&M's . 

One taste of the fried chicken and she was hooked !!! If you could see her face after the first bite ? Wow !    Lol

Funny thing , we eat very heatlhy at home , so she has NEVER tasted Kool Aid . I had to fight her for a sip as she almost lost her mind in the flavor . 

We will be moving to Vegas June 2016 from NJ  . M&M's will be our favorite go to spot . . . 

Thank you for having us ."}
{"text":"A few of us from work went last week...they would not accept the coupon, couldn't split the check between 2 people, forgot our red beans and rice order and argued with us about it although it was on the receipt and they were more concerned about decorating instead of helping the customers!

Really disappointed...food was mediocre...we will never go back."}
{"text":"Crispy golden chicken hot out the frying pan all of sides were good(black eye peas) stood out!!!!!awesome:)"}
{"text":"Surprisingly came across this place looking for breakfast and we were all on our way to Denny's. It's Easter Sunday so you can imagine lines and people everywhere. We peeped in the window and said let's give it a try. 

The decor is simple nothing to brag about. The staff are slightly disorderly but I think it was due to the rush. With the rush going we were just pointed to our seats versus being walked over. The server Jaayvon was nice and courteous and everything was bought out hot and fresh. 

So let's talk food. Well breakfast ends at 12:00 but they actually have a cut off around 11:40 which was slightly disappointing but chicken and waffles are served all day. I was in the mood for French toast however but it's okay. The chicken and waffles were very good. Chicken was cooked well and the waffles are wheat but delicious.

I do think they still have some work to do with the customer service aspect so overall I give it 3 stars and would come again to see if they have progressed with the level of service."}
{"text":"Delicious gravy and chicken. We liked the pork chops. The mac n cheese was disappointing. It was gritty and not fresh at all and it was freezing in the restaurant. We had a friendly waitress. I'd go back but order different sides."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. I've been there for breakfast and lunch. I think the waffles are whole wheat. not sure but they're great. I walked around the walls and looked at all the pictures. The oxtails were tasty"}
{"text":"Everytime I go to Vegas, I need to come here off the strip. Well worth the drive!

Service - The servers are so happy and helpful. They are very accommodating and will answer any question you have about the menu. I've never had once a complaint about them

Food - AMAZING. Fried Chicken and the Catfish are great. They also serve sides of cornbread (HoeCakes) to start.... hmm they are so tasty.  I love getting their lemonade to wash down the grub that this place has.   

Ambience - They have upgraded and remodeled the place. So the seats are much more comfortable and their's A/C on those hot days.  Good for small/big groups!

$ - Totally affordable. If you're in Vega$, definitely super cheap!!!"}
{"text":"They seated us after 30 minutes. My boyfriend got one crumbled piece of fish then 20 minutes later they brought out the other piece. My chicken was cold and their customer service was horrible. Would never eat there again"}
{"text":"I wanted a home cooked breakfast and this restaurant just so happened to be a quick walk away. I enjoyed chicken and waffles as well as creamy grits. My fiancèe got the liver breakfast and everything was yummy. The service was good and they greeted each guest and made sure they said good bye. So important to support the small businesses."}
{"text":"This spot near end of strip by Stratosphere Hotel was the epitome of soul food restaurant. With huge serving sizes and excellent fare, it is worth the ride from the big name hotels. The food is more than reasonably priced and the service was fast and friendly. Our waitress, Angie, was excellent!! Make this a pit stop when in Sin City"}
{"text":"The service here was fantastic and I was pleasantly surprised with my food. I had the catfish that was cooked to perfection with two delicious side. But I plan on going back soon for those yummy cornbread pancakes and some muddy water. The place needs a little make over inside but I guess that doesn't matter with food that good."}
{"text":"My servers name was Pearl and she was wonderful! Unfortunately the cook was late but my server stepped up and made my moms food and my food and it was delicious! I would definitely recommend this restaurant to my locals and to the tourists that visit our city!"}
{"text":"Disregard the facade, this is a very old building in need of desperate remodeling but who cares about the outside? Is the inside that counts...you know..the soul.
Ok disregard the inside also and lets concentrate on what's really important,the food!
We were here for breakfast but didn't realized that breakfast is only served at certain time in the morning so we ended up ordering something else from the menu. This was our first time in an all soul food restaurant aside from Popeyes fried chicken so it took us a while to go through the menu to finally order their very popular fried chicken and waffles. Service is good but a little bit disorganized when they get busy, we were asked what we wanted to drink about 4 times from 4 different employees and we got the food before our drinks. The fried chicken was very good, it was crispy and moist and the waffles were outstanding, the thing is there are so many places that serve good chicken in town I'm not sure I'll be making this my number one fried chicken destination. I know, I didn't ventured enough and tried something more soul-ish like the liver and onions or the Chitterlings, maybe I'm not much into the soul thing, but I do want to come back sometime and try the seafood gumbo, but for the meantime I'll just stick with some chicken soup for the soul."}
{"text":"If you're a Vegas native (such as myself) you know of M & M's. Its known around town as the best soul food cafe hands down. Since this is the only SF cafe I have ever been to, I can neither confirm nor deny that remark. But I will say that M's is a 'no bull' kind of establishment where the food talks and that's that. The place it self is nothing to write home about. It's located in the corner of a small run down shopping center, and since its in the less than desirable side of town, one may never think to stop by. But the food is a completely different story. Everything is hearty and delicious! The gravy is just Yum! the chicken is BETTER than any fried chicken my mom ever made, and the corn bread pancakes are a great lil surprise! The portions are pretty good, the prices are steeper (is that a word?) than expected but the food is soooo worth it!"}
{"text":"First time I ate there da food is delicious and I very much love the service I will be back there again thank u for great service"}
{"text":"If there is a rating less than one star this restaurant should get it. Worst service ever!! We got here an hour ago and NOBODY bothered to seat us. We were standing in front for a good 15 mins and nobody was there to greet us or seat us and the place was not even crowded. My husband had to go to a server and asked if we can sit in an empty table and that's how we got seated. It's more than an hour now and we still don't have our food yet, not even the appetizer that we ordered! We've been to the other location and we thought we would try this location but we were just sorry we came here. Horrible, horrible service."}
{"text":"Stopped by while in town working.

Was told this was a spot that Obama visited while here but found his folks just got his lunch here.

Food was on point... Had pork chops, collards, yams, and Mac/cheese. Yea wasn't diabetic sweet but the Kool-aid, yes I said Kool-aid, was!

The staff was also very cool. Very friendly and helpful.  Last but not least the music was great!

Will be coming back on my next visit!"}
{"text":"My mother is from Mississippi
I am born and raised in NYC
M & M is pure heaven. Absolute local, must see, must eat experience, gem. I'll gladly drink the Kool-Aid..... Thank you!"}
{"text":"Food was average. Some of it lacks flavor. The spot is very busy and it was very warm inside.  The service  was sparadic. The waitresses were busy but also doing alot of talking. Had to ask for silverware and napkins. I think the food is overpriced. $16.50 for 3 pieces of chicken."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill since the remodeling. It's a shame that the service is not up to par with Southern Hospitality. The waitress forgot parts of our order. Came in hungry and left hungry and I even ate my all of my order. It just goes to so you how displeasing the service was."}
{"text":"Overrated. Got the catfish. They messed up the sides. Disappointed."}
{"text":"On the high reccomendation of a friend...we took a trip off the beaten path for some soul food in Las Vegas.  M&M had some high praises to live up to and I was excited to see if all the hype was justified.

Our party of 3 got 2 orders of the fried chicken and one order of the oxtails on the reccomendation of the owner himself...first, the fried chicken...mmmmmm...one of the best fried chicken I have ever had! The oxtails were just as good, if not better! Almost like braised shortribs if you ask me...plus the oxtails were as big as my fists! Each order came with 3 sides, my favorites being the fried okra and the red beans and rice.  

Included with every order are these scrumptous cornmeal pancakes! Ohh, those pancakes!!! They were so good we had the waitress bring a second order of them BEFORE our food came out!

Not only was the food good here, all the wait staff and even the owner was pleasent...we had a nice 5 minute conversation with the owner once he found out we were from Hawaii, telling us that his daughter was born in Hawaii.

M&M is definately a staple from now on during every trip to Sin City!"}
{"text":"My friend from ny comes here all the time. So not Bronx BBQ in Long Island but definitely worth a trip, esp for Vegas. I love that they play 90s r&b! I think they had mint condition on when we walked in=good ambiance. So chicken and waffles, oxtail and gravy and everything is good. We went on a weekend and it was packed. The waitresses looked a little overwhelmed. Really good food and it's off the strip so we had to look for it. I been to a lot of nice upscale restaurants in Vegas. The food was here was one of the best and I will definetly be back the next time I go to Vegas."}
{"text":"While visiting Vegas, the hotel shuttle driver told us about this place... She said it was the best soul food in Vegas...  so we thought we would give it a try...  the neighborhood is not the best, but since it was mid afternoon we thought we would give it a try.....  we ordered the catfish, redbeans and rice, coleslaw and mac & cheese....  the catfish was some of the best I have ever had!  fresh, moist, tender and very well seasoned with a nice coat of cornmeal...  the sides were average..... portions and price were excellent and the customer service was very good...  would definitely recommend this place if your looking for some good soul food while in Vegas"}
{"text":"My sides (greens & yams) were delicious. My fish (red snapper) was hard as wood. My fish was severely over cooked. I tried to eat the parts that weren't over cooked but gave up. The manager was very kind and compensated us for the inconvenience and offered a return visit."}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend this place. From the moment we walked in service was horrible no one to greet you . They have a tablet for you to write your name on but you don't find out until 15 mins later when someone else walks in. Place smells horrible of dirty dish water or something. Waited 20 mins after finally being seated no one came to even ask if we wanted water. We left another couple said food wasn't anything special and we didn't miss anything."}
{"text":"Great breakfast right across from the stratosphere! It doesn't look like much outside but the inside is nice and clean and the food is full of soul.."}
{"text":"Service was good,food was good, banana pudding so Good make you want slap your grandma"}
{"text":"So this review is looooonnngg over due. 

When I waled in I felt a feeling like I've never felt before in a restaurant.  It was a feeling of I guess you could say home? Idk but it was nice my server was very nice and helpful I want to say her name was Toneishsa? Maby maby not? She was great though she kept me and my family laughing every time she came to the table.
The food: 
Omg where do I start.... The corn bread was sooooo good I had to order 2nds, chicken was juicy falling off the bone, ribs very flavorful and juicy, Mac and cheese bomb, let's just put it this way everything that touched my plate was delicious. Oh I almost forgot I didn't like the greens (that's because I'm picky about my greens) but my cousin enjoyed them!! 

My whole experience here was amazing! I also love the fact that this is a black business with black workers! 

IF YOUR IN VEGAS YOU GOTTA GET SOME M&M'S!"}
{"text":"Came here while in Vegas because we were craving some good ole soul food. The restaurant is in an old strip mall and could use a remodel. We had fried fish, oxtails, fried chicken, mac and cheese, collard greens, potato salad, and uptown (Which they call dirty water). Everything was good, except the oxtails. They were huge and flavorless, but will definitely visit them next time I am in town"}
{"text":"Well.. if you have watched the latest episodes of Sweetie Pie, and wondered what could have gone more wrong for Tim and Co. at his Houston venture, look no further, cause M&M is it. 

All you need is light and camera, and Gordon Ramsay himself, and this one can easily go down in one of the \"Kitchen Nightmare\" episode.  Or give Robert Irvine a call, and this will do quite well for \"Restaurant Impossible\". 

Sarcasm aside, let me get in the experience my wife and myself just endured today.  

After waking up early in Vegas (around 1230), my wife decided to check out M&M Soul Food Café since her friends from Seattle (Red Flag #1) told her this was a great joint for soul food.  We caught a Uber and arrived in the not so crowded restaurant, about 7 waiting (including us) and a dozen or so dining in.  So I thought to myself we shouldn't wait anytime with our dining experience. 

A sign near the host stand caught my eyes while we were waiting, indicating all fried food will take 25~40 min (Red Flag #2).  I have been in the industry for 20+ years, managing restaurant big and small, never have I seen a sign like this before. But when in Rome...

Ambiance (2 out of 5)

Typical diner set up.  This one doesn't bother me as much since most soul food place is defined by their food rather attractions. 

Speed of Service (1 out of 5)

I have to separate quality and speed here because the staff were actually friendly (forgetful, but friendly).  But the speed..

After the waitress, singular as we didn't see another one for another 1 and 1/2 hr later, took our drink and food order, it took another 30 minutes for the \"cornbread\" to arrive.  We then waited nearly 45 min, and watched 2 tables worth of customer (who sat after us) leaving, we got our food.  Despite telling the waitress to have my fried food for take out, so my wife and I can enjoy the non-fried food first, everything came at once.  

Quality of Food (1 to 2 out of 5)

I ordered a good sampling of the food, because I wanted to be fair to my judgment. 

Cornbread - I know these are actually mini pancake with corn bread mix, but they tasted delicious especially when you top them with some tabasco.  4/5.

Collard Green - I hate stems in my greens.  Stems checked.  I hate watery greens because they lessen the flavor.  Watery green checked. 1/5

Corns - This must be either canned or frozen, with little process.  I would've settled if they just simmer some frozen corn in butter.  But corn kernels simmered in hot water? No thanks. 1/5

Beef Short Rib - I had to settle for this since the waitress told me their Ox tail would take 1 hr to make (Red Flat #3).  The flavor would have been great if they didn't doused with BBQ sauce.  I think the rib was slow cooked with the greens.  Not a bad idea.  3/5 

Chitlins - This dish was actually pretty good.  I know some of your food critiques would complain about the smell and question whether they were treated properly.  But I grew up in a farm in China, so I am okay if my plate of chitlins smell a bit on the raw side.  It's tender and completely broken down, a bit more spice would be nice, but this is nice. 4/5

Fried Fish - 4 oz of cat fish fillets don't take 1 hr to make.  It doesn't matter if this is Chinese math or Deep south math.  There is nothing write home about these.. no bones? 2/5

Fried Chicken - Though I disagreed with my wife that her chicken was better than the restaurant we went to yesterday, I assured her that hers were better today.  But I was so hangry, I finished mine anyway.  Kind of wished I saved the $$$ for some KFC or Popeye when I get home. 1/5

Seafood Gumbo - Gumbo should not be snoddy (Red Flag #4).  Put some acid (tomato will do), and it will break down the chemical chains which make snoddy gumbo.  My wife had a horrible experience with it and I couldn't say much about it either.  Just because you have all the ingredients of a gumbo in a dish, does not make it a seafood gumbo 1/5. 

Price (1/5)

Just because you are near the strip, does not mean you can charge it.  Especially with the slow service, unattentative table touches, and sub par food.  The menu price does not justify the food, in a bad way. 

Overall (1/5)

I heard there is another M&M on Charleston Blvd, and the food there is better.  But I only had the experience at the one north of the strip.  I must regrettably say my experience was not a fond one.  If the ownership or manager thought I was overtly harsh or critical, I am more than willing to offer more insightful suggestions regarding operation or improvement. 

Bests,"}
{"text":"I am a very picky eater and I am very very health conscious. However, I love good quality food with natural flavors. I have been living in Vegas for 6 years and never been here before. I saw the reviews and figured I'd give it a try. I really wanted to try Oxtail since I have never had it. OMG! So me and my husband who have had ate pretty much everywhere in Vegas that claim to be \"HIGH END\" \"TOP CUISINE\" that are overly priced restaurants. There is nothing that can compare to this place... NOTHING! 

We ordered, the Oxtail with collard greens, red beans and rice, macaroni and cheese, Fried Chicken, Okra, and Chitterlings. My husband is the whitest white guy on earth and he was hesitant about trying pig intestines. He loved it!!!!! This will be my go to place from now on when I Have my \"cheat meals\". 

The service is top notch. Everyone there is soooooo friendly and the service is soooooo quick. I am absolutely in love with this place and will recommend this place to EVERYONE!!!! I am so excited I finally found a place in Vegas where they believe in QUALITY FOOD and excellent service. Huge portions also. Our tab was $25 for all that food. 

If I could rate this 10 stars I would!!!!!"}
{"text":"I loooove the food at M&M!

They start off by serving you corn bread pancakes. I was already hooked and I hadn't even had their fried chicken or collard greens yet! I got the smothered chicken, which was friend chicken smothered in gravy. They gave me the option of dark or white meat, and I chose the white meat. My BF got BBQ chicken (dark meat), and it was so juicy, so next time I will definitely get that as well. We got mashed potatoes, corn bread stuffing, collard greens, and mac and cheese for the sides. All tasted so good with our chicken. I also got a sweet tea to tie everything together. Although I thought I couldn't eat anymore, I somehow found some room for peach cobbler. And I am glad I did! 

The food here matches the service. Our server was so nice and friendly, she made sure we had everything we needed and checked up on us often! 

I would recommend this cafe for anyone who's looking for some good soul food!"}
{"text":"I'm an older white guy who grew up in the Chicago area but had friends and relatives from the South where I was able to sample Southern and Soul restaurants through many southern states. At my Asian wife's suggestion (she LOVES her fried chicken) we went here for Mother's Day with our oldest son who loves him some chicken and waffles.

I could not believe the quality of the food! Absolutely the best black-eyed peas and greens I've ever eaten with delicious fried catfish. Our son had the fried chicken and my wife decided on the pork chops. We were all exclaiming out loud how good the food was at every bite. The staff was professional and friendly. As we were leaving, many AA faces were smiling and happy to see us there. When a party of older people were leaving, the men held the door open for us. I wished their party a \"Happy Mother's Day\" and they were happy and gracious in returning the good will.

Yes, we will be back. Over and over again! Great food, great atmosphere, I just wish they'd turn down the volume on the music. Old guys have a hard enough time hearing dinner conversation as it is."}
{"text":"Smothered pork chops, super sweet service, and complimentary sweet cornbread pancakes?
Okay, you have my attention!

Drove past this place several times and couldn't tell if they were open- found favorable reviews on Yelp and headed in the very next day with the BF. We were immediately welcomed by two lovely ladies who were super friendly throughout our visit- though sadly their names escape me.

I ordered the half order of smothered pork chops with sides of mac and greens, while BF went for their chicken and waffles. While our order was being made, we received the famous sweet cornbread pancakes- and sweet they are! Warm and tasty, but yes, super sweet- as is the muddy waters beverage my guy was drinking.

Orders came in, hot in fresh out the kitchen...
The chops are amazing. Second only to a fabulous place in Texas, but they're not kidding about that \"world famous gravy\"- it's downright decadent. Cant even find words to describe the flavor, but it's amazing. The chop was a good size and cooked well, too. Mac was a little on the dry side, and the greens were way too salty for our tastes- they may have been canned? In the future I'd just opt for two chops a la carte, but I'm a total glutton...

BF had the chicken and waffles and raved about them- I took a bite and the waffle was super sweet, and tasted like it was made with brown sugar. Yum, but too sweet for me, let alone for an entree. The chicken was good too- very crispy. BF says is the best chicken he's had in a damn long while. And he knows his chicken.

Would come back again, likely sticking to the chops for me. They also have a breakfast menu til 11AM- might have to check that out. I didn't see shrimp and grits on their menu, but if they ever offer it as a special I'd get my butt down there in a hurry!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place when I went there while I was on a business trip. Since then I have bought a second home in Las Vegas and plan on frequenting this place whenever I have a chance."}
{"text":"I tried them before and had oxtails, everything about it was terrible including the service. ( Charleston location ) So I went to the Charleston location today. I placed a call in order for a half portion of Short Ribs with Mac n cheese and collard greens for sides. Let's start with the actual call which I had to place 5x's before I got an answer. Not the most professional people answering the phone. I get there and a young lady named Tonisha help me. She was very pleasant, however the rest of the staff were quite loud and ghetto. It seems that they were having their own little party, which is probably why I had to call so many times before getting an answer. After all they didn't look that busy when I walked in. Now let's get to the food. It looked like something you would get I a school cafeteria. It was 1 rib, the sides were skimpy and not good at all. I was actually upset that I live so far away and I had to eat it. I would've been more upset if I had waisted $16.73!! Would I eat here again? Probably not!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious , waiter service trash . very rude & it's already 109 degrees hot outside . Half of the building Is cool than the other half is hot This is ridiculous"}
{"text":"Unprofessional!!! Walked out on these sorry ass waitresses just walking by, not taking orders. It's the fight weekend and I guess they think they poppn with these bad ass weaves and fake ass eye lashes!! Poppn is learning how to be hospitable when it's busy and providing customer service. I'll never visit this establishment again!! I coulda ate this shit at home in LA!! They need 2 be re-trained and where the hell is management???"}
{"text":"When I need my soul food fix, this is the spot! Never disappoints! I like the beef short ribs with BBQ sauce and my husband usually gets the liver. There are a lot of great foods on the menu that I have tried, however, I am a creature of habit!

I have always had great service and quick pick up. All the waitstaff has been polite to me, even offering recommendations when I want to stray from my favorites!

Only wish is that there were two locations, perhaps, closer to Summerlin!! A girl can dream right."}
{"text":"The customer service was pleasant / mediocre. I'm not sure if i got there at a busy time , but due to the wait I sat at the counter top. It took a while for me to get a menu and for someone to greet me . Once i received a menu it took a while for someone to take my order. The woman who took my order was very quick I would like to say and also pleasant . I ordered my food To - Go and they called me very quick to come and pick it up . The food was very good . I ordered the fried chicken , collards, mac n cheese, and also yams. Even though the Mac n cheese seemed a little dry and lacked flavor i still give the food a 3 out of 5."}
{"text":"Excellent service, yams were sweet and perfect.  Fried chicken was on point.  Meatloaf not so much, but still good. Cornbread pancakes were great.  Once again, food and staff are great!  Best of both."}
{"text":"To jump straight to the point, it's okay. Three people were in my oarty and we ordered the full order of fried chicken, full order of catfish and half order of bbq chicken. 

I can (and will) only speak for the taste of the fried chicken. The fried chicken was well seasoned...but the meat itself seemed kind of dry. I had also ordered greens, mac & cheese & mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were alright, nothing extraordinary. Mac & cheese wasn't as cheesy as I prefer, but again..alright. The greens... I can cook greens so I'm pretty particular. I prefer mine spicy, these greens were not. They were quite smokey tasting. Some people prefer that. 

The pros about this joint is that there is a lot of space, the mason jar kool aid (drinks in general) are a nice touch and the hot water cornbread served with the meals was great! 

There is room for improvement in the service. The person acting as hostess that day (she was also serving, wish we had gotten sat in her section) was sweet and attentive. Our server stopped by to take our order and drop off our food and check. Our server never checked on us or our drinks... how our food tasted. I was thinking that maybe she was having a bad day, but I've served... leave your home problems at home. 
There is also room for improvement on the flavor and quality of some of the food... but that may vary by person. Those who did not grow up eating and/or cooking soul food may not know, ha, but it can be executed much better. 

Speaking about everything outside of the hostess... it just seemed like everyone didn't really care today. Perhaps just one of those days? I'm antsy to try the other location... I'm used to seeing a soul food joint on every other corner. I don't always feel like cooking, ha!

Don't come to Vegas for soul food... if you are really craving it, try this location if you want to - but don't expect anything to blow your mind."}
{"text":"I'm originally from California so my family and enjoy to taste of home every once in awhile. Over the last year or so the service here is going down. The young ladies that take the orders have a bad attitude and act as they are doing you a favor. The portion sizes have decreased when the prices are the same. I was very disappointed when I got home and seen my small portion of burnt peach cobbler. I don't mind spending money for quality food. However I felt like I wasted my money and the service was ghetto."}
{"text":"Service was great. This place use to be our top soul food places to go all the time but they recently changed their menu and upped their prices. 2.95 for a cup of koolaid without any refills that's just greedy/crazy. They use to always have refills before. The fish half plate use to come with one FILLET and a full would have two. Not anymore you get one fillet for the full order. Their portions are smaller and they changed the noodles in the Mac and cheese. The greens and cabbage are the same. It definitely downgraded!"}
{"text":"What a treat! Had the chicken and waffles with koolaid! Then you know you had a true soul food experience."}
{"text":"If No stars was an option that would be their rating. We arrived at 8pm (1hr. before closing). It took approximately 5 minute to be seated, with less than 15 people in the restaurant. Once seated it took 10 minutes to receive our drink orders. Two of the sides we attempted to order were not available, bc they were \"about to close.\" We (4 people) ordered an appetizer and meals. At 9:10pm we left, because we still had not received our food."}
{"text":"The service (Janean) was nothing less than excellent, the food was very very good. When I'm back in Vegas, I'll definitely visit again. I had the smothered chicken, collard greens, mashed potatoes and the sweet potatoes. And ended it with the banana pudding (which was excellent). Love love it!"}
{"text":"It was our first time at this establishment which was based on a referral from a family member that lives in Vegas. It was a busy Sunday evening. No one greeted us so we sat ourselves at a corner table. We were given menus after a little while but that was it! We watched 3 parties come in and be seated. Some regulars took seats at the counter and got water served to them and their order taken immediately. We watched as the waitress cleaned tables and ignored us. We finally got up and left. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"I  love the food here. The gravy on the smothered fried chicken is so good. the red beans and rice and the black eyed peas were very tasty. Try the peach Cobbler you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"It's sad that the first review I write on this site is a bad one. If you are going to put your restaurant on the Las Vegas strip your establishment should be up to par. Unfortunately this place doesn't hold up. When my friend and I arrived on a Saturday evening it was slow and we we seated quickly. Our server took a little too long to arrive to take drink orders. It was understandable as she was training someone. They were both very nice though.
     Things went downhill from there unfortunately. service from the kitchen was super slow. The hot water cornbread they brought it as we waited was terrible and over cooked. I ordered the half order pork chop dinner with cornbread dressing and greens. The pork chop was pretty good but on the small side. I've had better ant many other soul food restaurants and my mom's house. The sides however, were awful. The cornbread dressing was super wet and almost soupy. The greens had an extreme amount of black pepper. My friend ordered the full catfish meal with Mac and cheese, yams and string beans. It was a complete disaster. The fish was fried too hard, the Mac and cheese was dry and the string beans and yams were cold. I forced my meal down but my friend couldn't even finish her meal. It was taken off the bill, but when she asked to lodge a complaint to the manager, they refused to come out and talk to us. Very unprofessional. 
     I want to support black businesses, but when you treat your own people like this and serve less than mediocre food, it a shame that I have to write a review like this in order for you to do better. And get someone's granny to go in the kitchen and whip them into shape."}
{"text":"I came here for a late lunch. As we entered, we were told to sit anywhere. The windows were darkly tinted. Not sure why this was. Seemed like it wasn't in a great neighborhood. We saw bullet holes in the windows. That's a scary thought but at least windows were darkly tinted. 

The nice lady gave us menus and wiped down our table. The ladies here were working hard. Busy place, so that means something. As I browsed through the menu, I decided to get the fried chicken meal, Half plate which runs around $11.00 and includes two sides. They charge extra for white and dark meat so make sure you get one of the same. For the sides, I got fried okra and potato salad. The potato salad was a little tangy but good. The fried okra was good as well. Not too greasy. The chicken was a little over cooked because when I tried to cut it open, the meat was dry but I enjoyed everything else. I had literally like 3 refills. The mason jars were small. 

Our service was excellent which is why I gave them four stars. I definitely liked the service here. Ladies were friendly. I enjoyed the vibe inside as they were playing old school hip hop. My daughter ended up dancing and bopping her head. Some of the songs brought me back to the past. 

The restrooms were separated by side. It's only a one stall bathroom and it was clean. 

Parking is too the side of the actual restaurant. I would come back to try other items."}
{"text":"Ive been here numerous times, i usually get the smothered porkchops. I like it a lot, i tend to ignore my sides...i like that they have kool aid on their menu...

Just in case you order the ribs, order the full, once we ordered the half and were upset to find out once we got home it was only 2 pieces of meat and it was delicious"}
{"text":"Great soul food joint that really knows what Southern Food is all about. SWEET Tea (yes, that sweet), real Texas Pete hot sauce on the table, great grits, bacon, eggs and biscuits, Also fantastic chicken and waffles (OK, waffles are eggos out of the freezor case, but the bird is dead on). I am from NC and have been all over the South eating bird, OK? I KNOW bird. This is GOOD bird - crisp, almost greaseless, and HOT outta the fryer. Best locals soul food joint in LV - trust me."}
{"text":"Absolute best place in town for fried chicken. Ribs are great, sides are awesome. Always craving this place ! Servers are really nice too"}
{"text":"Great stop for soul food!  

We walked in as a party of 8 at around 7:30 and we did not realize they were closing at 8pm, (oops) but they welcomed us in with a smile!  They could have easily turned us away or given us the take-out option, but they did not.  Instead they demonstrated service that would only continue to add a quality effect to this great dining experience with friends! 

They started us out with some Arnold Palmers, Sweet Teas and Cool-Aids and then some delicious sweet Corncakes.  Drinks were delicious and refillable throughout the evening.  The Corncakes were simply delicious warm and lightly sweetened. 

Then on to the main dish! Our group ordered Catfish, Oxtail, Smothered Meatloaf, and of course Fried Chicken!  My Fried Chicken was wonderfully seasoned, crispy and juicy.  Best of all you can order half orders for a lot of their menu items.  Full orders will  come with your choice of 3 sides and half orders with 2 sides. 

On this occasion I had their Cornbread Dressing topped with Brown Gravy and their Yams.   Both were delicious and the right portion.  I love that they don't over sweeten or spice up their yams and the dressing is comparable to Thanksgiving stuffing.    Some of the other sides enjoyed tonight were their Macaroni and Cheese, Collard Greens, Green Beans, Mash Potatoes, and Rice and Beans.  All delicious!

This place has been here for a while and they recently renovated their dining area to a pleasant 50's looking diner! Also they have another location across from the Stratosphere with a Grand Opening in 7 days and that location will be open 24 hours which is very much needed and welcomed for our city that never sleeps!

The comfort food served at M & M's satisfies our cravings but their continued great service will make this place our first choice for Soul Food."}
{"text":"Was in Vegas and craving some Soul Food. Asked some locals where to go and they told me about this place and it hit the spot. I leave in a week and I wanna try to go at least 2 more times lol."}

Catfish breakfast entree for me and Chicken & Waffles for my hubby!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! As a Mississippi girl my standards are pretty high and this place more than delivered. Fabulous fried green tomatoes, fried chicken and the liver and onions was the best I have ever eaten. Atifa was our server and she was polite and very helpful as we took forever to decide what we wanted to order. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I don't go to many soul food restaurants, but this one was pretty good! I ordered the full order of smothered chicken (with the gravy on the side) with Mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, and fried okra. The chicken was delicious and the skin was nice and crispy! I've never had fried okra but I really enjoyed it. The Mac and cheese was good, nothing spectacular, and the mashed potatoes weren't anything special. But overall I really enjoyed my meal! My mom ordered the half order of grilled catfish and it had good flavor, but it was extremely tiny. 

The service was awesome! Loved our waiter, Angie!! Extremely sweet and funny, made our first time experience even better."}
{"text":"Today, me, the wife and child visited this establishment for breakfast.  While the outside of the restaurant is not particularly attractive, the inside is neat, clean and has two plasma TV's with Sportcenter.  That's always a good start.  We were allowed to seat ourselves.  From a fabulous southern/soul food selection, I was the most adventurous, ordering the liver and onions for about $6.00.  My meal came with the choice of potatoes, grits, or rice; two eggs made to order, and a biscuit or toast.  I had the grits and the bisquit.  The liver was covered with brown gravy and onions.  The portion was huge, and I did not finish it.  The biscuit was small but tasty.  The grits were good as far as I could tell.  My wife is the grits lover, and she said they were tops.  My wife ordered the cheese omelette.  I also tried a few bites.  This is not the typical omelette that his a majority of fluffy eggs with a little bit of cheddar.  This is more like a flat, triple folded omelette filled with cheese and cheese on top.  Everyone has their priorities with omelettes, ours is more about the cheese than the egg, so we were delighted.  Her omelette with choice of toast came to $6.99.  There was no child's menu, but for $4.00, we purchased the french toast.  We tend to eat \"family style\" and the kid at my eggs, then ate most of the french toast, careful to avoid the dreaded crust.  I tried the french toast and it was six half slices of battered bread with a hint of cinnamon.  It was delicious.  Our coffee was $1.50, and the waitress was attentive, keeping the cup filled.  I would say that we were able to eat 2/3 of the meal, and we arrived pretty hungry.  If you are tired of the usual breakfast, you can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"I got lost trying to find this place, it's on the West side of the I-15.  The food is good, but the waitress was sassy.  I liked the fried chicken with waffles and sweet tea. Yes, they do have Kool-Aid."}
{"text":"I wish I could get my money back. We never go out to eat, but decided we were long overdue for a date, so we chose to waste our one day out at the extremely overrated M & Ms. 

$40 for overly fatty, cheap quality ox tails, and short ribs that were more fat and bone than meat. Mac & cheese was extremely bland; greens obviously came out of a can; fried okra came out of a bag from the freezer; dressing was extremely dense, but the flavor was okay; black eyed peas had no flavor; cabbage was mushy & flavorless. Everything was cold. Oh..and the cornbread pancakes (???)...uh uh. That is not cornbread. 

Come on now...southern food is made from scratch!  And use a smoked turkey neck once n a while!

I've noticed every restaurant in this city has been voted Best of Las Vegas at one point or another. That endorsement is quickly losing its value with me. 

On the bright side, if this nasty place can stay in business for as long as it has, we're going to be around forever when we open our own restaurant

* Service was very good though. The staff was friendly, helpful, and quick to assist us. Thank you."}
{"text":"This place is just freakin awesome!!!
Great service great food great value. Shared the gumbo and smothered fried chicken with the boyfriend and it was more than enough food for the both of us. The fried chicken would definitely have to be my fave. Their gravy is very savory and definitely compliments their fried chicken. The boyfriend also ordered a Muddy Water and he said it was THE BEST LEMONADE + ICED TEA hes ever had in his life. We got refill after refill and the nice waitress even asked us if we wanted one to go. Only downside is that its in a so-so location. Would definitely come back here again for some good ol' soul food."}
{"text":"I am giving this place 5 stars because it is the best soul food restaurant in Las Vegas. 

Let me say... this really is like home. oh wait, but I've never been to the south. THAT'S HOW GOOD THIS PLACE IS. Truly southern soul food. Just absolutely amazing. That's all I can really say about this place. I've had other soul food in Las Vegas but it was just too salty. The cornbread pancake is absolutely delicious and is unlimited! 

All I usually get is the smothered chicken, mashed potatoes, and the cornbread dressing. I got the half-order so I only could get 2 sides. 3 if you get the full order, but honestly the food is pretty heavy and so I barely finished it.

The waitresses are so attentive and so friendly its unbelievable. I'd move to the south right now if I could have this every day. But then I probably wouldn't. Hah. I want to just get up and dance like James Brown because he releases the soul in me. 

They keep true to their southern roots by having other dishes like Cat Fish with sides like Okra. AND CALLING AN ARNOLD PALMER A MUDDY WATER? As dirty as it sounds, I'll drink it everyday. It seriously couldn't get any more southern than this. 

Even the interior reminds me of an old school diner back in the 50's. Everything just black and white. I wouldn't have been surprised if Bill Haley & The Comets just came out and sang Rock Around the Clock. 

Just by the way.... Bird is the Word..... 
oh shoot that's the 60s........

My #justeatit rating is: WheneverIwanttoreleasetheblackinme

{"text":"The corn cakes that came out first were the best part of the meal, hands down, and are really memorable. Fried chicken, mac-n-cheese, and collard greens were average. Would have given three stars but the service was unbelievably slow to the point of feeling intentionally ignored."}
{"text":"Very sad about what happened .
Yesterday Feb 11 my mom me and 5 other ladies went in for breakfast. Why did it take almost 2 hours before we got ir breakfast ...there excuse was there was one cook in the back.. That is no excuse all they offered us was free kool aid.... NO JOKE. I just wish they were honest about the situation instead of telling us 15 more minutes and 2 hours go bye.. I will eat my soul food here in Daygo...I will not return back here unless they can get it together and have better customer service ...Free KOOL AID IS NOT GONNA CUT IT ..ill wait for the Manager to get back to me . Ill repost soon if they do or not.
Thank you
Jerry"}
{"text":"I visited this location and had a terrible experience. My catfish is fried too hard twice my sides where cold, and how long it take for our food to come out it was ridiculous. For this to be a soul food place the macaroni and cheese tasted terrible. I had asked to see a manager and no one came over to speak to me. I specifically went up there myself and ask for a manager and looked at the manager in her face when I asked to speak to her  and she still never came over. The food was removed from my bill as it should be since I never eat it! I'll never go back to this soul food location."}
{"text":"So we get to M&M's for breakfast...and when we attempted to order chicken and waffles, Tashara the waitress said they were out of wings. That they were waiting for them to be dropped off. I don't understand. I mean I get it, but it was only 10:00 am. I couldn't stay and support that foolishness. I give them one star for having a simple menu."}
{"text":"Food is alway on point. Owner always shows luv when i come thru. If your in the mood for some good soul food this is the best spot."}
{"text":"omg this place was soooo delish, the fried fish and chicken with the sides of mac n cheese greens and red beans and rice oh yea don't forget the kool-aid. if u looking for some down earth soul food! this is the place for ur soul!!!"}
{"text":"Soul food in Vegas?  Uh, yeah.  I am from Chicago and soul food restaurants here are plenty.  Some good, some bad.  All of them are filled with homey, down-to-earth personnel that make you feel you're at your grandmother's house.  This is a good thing if the food is worth it.

So I have been wanting to try M&M for a few years now after reading all the good reviews on many LV boards.  Finally tried it yesterday morning and am glad I did.  Being on West Charleston, I know the area leaves much to be desired, but so is every other soul food restaurant I've been to.  The inside is diner-looking with music blaring, several tables and a counter.  The personnel was a surprise with their almost-formal attire.  Interesting.  We walk in and I hear, \"hey, how yall doing?\" LOUDLY.  Yeah, that's a sign this is going to be good.  Following is what we ordered:

Chicken Wings and Waffles, side of two eggs over medium:  The chicken wings - oh, the chicken wings!  Hot, fresh and oh so golden.  I tore the wing apart and smiled with I saw the smoke rising from this wonderful morsel.  The waffles were oval in shape and were soft with a maple flavor even before I put the syrup on.  Delicious.  The eggs were eggs, no complaint.

Turkey Sausage and eggs, grits and toast:  Everything was cooked to perfection.

With coffees all around, we got out of there with a bill of $22.15.

The service was a bit slow, but they were swamped so again, no complaints.

All told, I will be back.  Imagine that, soul food in Vegas."}
{"text":"I waited almost a hour for this?  Plus 15 mins to be seated.  Catfish was cold...collards tasted like nothing...mac&cheese tasted like nothing....and they can't even make their own tarter sauce?"}
{"text":"We drove past the sign saying \"soul food\", and hubby instantly remembered having read about this place years back. We both loved fried chicken when in New Orleans and decided to eat dinner there right there and then. 

The building is by the road and looks pretty anonymous, but it is rather nice on the inside. Not high end, but a down to earth place where you can enjoy a good meal :) 

We were greeted as we entered and shown to a table. A waiter came to our table instantly, and a nice Muddy Waters tasted lovely along with the cornbread.

I noticed this place has some 1 and 2 stars and after having dined here, I have come to the conclusion that American yelpers simply are too strict in their rating.  Oh, you were not met with a warm hellooo when you arrived (nor a hug?) .. Is that really important? I take such ratings with a huge pinch of salt from now on.. 

BECAUSE, the chicken and waffel were awesome and the waiters nice and attentive. Also, we paid less than $30 for two persons and I was not even able to eat everything. We left being totally full and satisfied. 

I did not quite get the menu as there were little info on each dish, but I could have just asked. Next time I will. That being said, I am Norwegian and not updated on Southern food really. 

 So, to conclude, I will be back and will truly recommend eating here to my friends."}
{"text":"This place is a jewel in Las Vegas!  The service Aimani gave my group was outstanding.  Food was very delicious!  I really enjoyed this soul food spot and will be back again when I return to Sin City!"}
{"text":"Blessed! Bigger is better! Food still on point after a long nite out! Need bigger sides now!"}
{"text":"This place should have been great, the place had good music playing, it was clean, and the service was great. Only 1 problem the food was bad. I ordered the fried chicken with greens and yams. The waitress told me the chicken would take 20 mins too cook due to the chicken being fresh I agreed to wait. After what seemed like 5 mins out came my fried chicken dinner. I started to ask questions but the chicken looked good and was hot so I gave it a try. Well the chicken was tuff ,stringy and dripping very hot oil. The bottom line was that the Chicken wasn't freshly cooked, it had been precooked and put back into the hot oil and reheated(NASTY!) The greens had a slightly sweet taste and the yams were way too sweet for my taste.
   Overall I have to say this place should be great but the kitchen staff was more interested in the 2 young women that they were entertaining during my visit. I really hope this was not the norm for this place, everything is in place for this to be a great restaurant. It seems like this place is in need of leadership, before leaving I asked to speak with the Manager and was told the manager was gone and would be back in a few hours. 

Save your money if you want some tasty Chicken, go to the Cafe in the Winn Hotel and order the Chicken and Waffle's and make sure to ask for the spicy syrup (unreal !!!!!!)."}
{"text":"This location has great food but the customer service is THE WORST. I had lunch here and received the worst waitressing experience ever from a young lady named Ashley. She started the experience with a very passive attitude and when my friend found a hair on her plate, Ashley proceeded to pick out the hair in front of us and asked my friend \"are you sure this isn't yours?\". That was very rude of her to do that right in front of customers and not just simply take the plate back without any objections. The next time I come to this location I will request to be helped by Tashara, she always never disappoints when I visit this location. Also when a customer asks for tartar sauce with fried catfish, please never bring out the entire craft bottle and plop it on the table, that's pretty unprofessional. Next time put the tartar sauce in a small dish or bowl."}
{"text":"Excellent soul food! My son recommended we stop here and was not disappointed for breakfast. The portion was huge. My hubby got the catfish and I ordered the shrimp and grits. The muddy water drink was the bomb! The ambience needs an update!"}
{"text":"Food was great, I could have eaten more. It was worth the opportunity to come here with my family. Being from Louisiana I enjoyed the southern hospitality. So if you're in las vegas come check this restaurant, its worth it!"}
{"text":"First and last time at this location.  When I walked in the door the waitress hollers from across the room did I want dine in or carry out.  I wanted carry out.  She hollers to me to sit at the counter and she would take my order.  Fifteen minutes later she takes my order.  Thirty minutes later I get my order.  I ordered two fish dinner and one dessert.  When I got home, I discovered I didn't get the dessert AND I was over charged $5.00.  I called and asked to speak to the manager and was put on hold.  After 10 minutes I called back and was told the manager was busy.  I drove back to the restaurant.  The manager was very pleasant and rectified the problem.  The fish was good.  The cabbage was over cooked.  The peach cobbler and yams were good.  The string beans and potato salad were average.  There was only two waitress's for the entire restaurant."}
{"text":"The best soul food I've ever had I'm addicted. Never been disappointed. It's very clean I do kind of wish the sides were a little bit more in portion but I'm satisfied"}
{"text":"A tad over priced for its portions, but the food tastes good, and gives a different type of American feel than your typical diners. Loved the cornbread cakes, though the place could be a tiny bit cleaner."}
{"text":"When I want fried chicken for breakfast this is my go to place. That's right! Fried chicken and grits for breakfast! I happily order this at 10:am after gym class even! Hey, why not, you've got all day to work off all the calories! 

The fried chicken here is always a perfect golden brown, juicy, and the seasoning blend used for the chicken is simple like my mama's fried chicken. Sorry for the lack of pix. I don't want to get razzed about it especially after workout. 

This down home diner is cool! The small L-shaped dining room  has tables and counter set up. Love when you walk in there is r&b, soul tunes playing. I feel at home! All the servers are friendly, funny and down to earth. Full service, so find yourself a table and they'll come over and take your order.

The only downside is the parking lot here on the corner of Charleston and Valley 
View is jacked up!  Especially if you come during their busy hours. Good luck finding a parking space!  It's all good, Im just happy I can get fried chicken and grits before the lunch crowd."}
{"text":"I'm use to the M&M's in my home town L.A. they are a little different here, they have an ad playing on the local r&b station which is great advertising for the restaurant when they mention that they serve catfish if you like a type other than cat like filetosole they don't serve it here which was really strange to me....Other than that the experience is good."}
{"text":"Mississippi potatoes, excellent, great omelet, grilled biscuit, all awesome, staff is also always great.  I try to go every time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"O...M...G...heart attacks served on plates have never attracted me very much until my arrival at M & M's. I am very fortunate that this place exists in Vegas because there are times where I really need comfort food and some southern hospitality, to make myself feel better about rotting in sin city. 

Their smothered fried chicken, green beans and mac and cheese is freakin' awesome! And while cornbread is a simple item, I've never had it prepared like pancakes before; those perfectly delicious, yellow, circular cakes are so delightful. Additional props for offering kool-aid as a beverage choice as I waver between that and sweet tea. I think while some people might be turned off by the prices of this place, I don't mind as I feel their portions and quality are worth it. 

Maybe I'm not used to the effects of soul food, but I typically have to fight off food coma. OR I get drunk off their food. No, it's not alcohol that is impairing my vision/senses/motor abilities/ability to think; it's their good food. This is the only \"bad\" thing I can think of, and even that won't deter me from coming back."}
{"text":"This has become one of my favorite spots in Las Vegas. Food is excellent......I typically will frequent there at least twice while I am in town. You must try there Chicken and Waffles for breakfast, dinner or lunch..... Greens,  Yams, and Redbeens and Rice is on point!!!! Be sure and ask for Pearl she is Amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I'm just now leaving this place ... I live in Vegas for almost a year and I'm from Texas . And I've been iffy about the \"soul food places \" here . The ppl TRIED but the food really sucked !!! The fried chicken was good ( after waiting 35 min for my order ) but everything else was really not good . Wait fried okra was great !! The \"ribs\" ( only gave me ONE rib with this nasty gravy on it ... ) WHO DOES THAT TO RIBS ,?? .. I don't even think it was a rib ! I'm really upset cause I paid over 30 bucks for food that I didn't enjoy.. Didn't open food till I got home ... I'm realllllllllllllly realllllyyyy disappointed in the food ."}
{"text":"I was skeptical at first due to the reviews but glad I decided to taste their food myself. When we arrived we were greeted by a very friendly lady who seated us, followed by our waitress Ebony, who provided excellent service for my family of 8. The only minor compliant was some of my party rec'd their coffee well after dinner arrived. The food was seasoned, portions were big, and the place was clean. Give it a chance you WILL NOT be disappointed!! Oh and they have kool-aid on the menu :) Try the chicken fried chicken, it was outstanding!!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing, my hunny had the oxtail plate and I got the chicken and waffles. This restaurant did not disappoint at all. We enjoyed every bit of our plate"}
{"text":"Cool Lil small place really like down south feel. First time eating here didn't have a good experience. This time we sat down and ate inside it was amazing great staff and food"}
{"text":"Everything was absolutely delicious. Fried chicken fried to perfection. Kool Aid mixed with lemonade perfect. Smothered pork chops... let's just say I sucked the bone. Collard greens... I drank the juice.. everything was on point"}
{"text":"oxtails werent as tender as they could have been but the gravy was good.. short ribs were really tender, i would probably get that next time with the gravy. its a good spot to eat at"}
{"text":"I hate to complain about this place because their food is actually good and so is the service but this place ruined my Thanksgiving. I ordered a deep fried turkey from this place for $130 and what I got was a complete mess. Not only was my turkey late. It was burnt and soggy. I ordered about a week in advanced and set a time to pick up at another location but when I arrived at my time I had to wait another half hour then a lady with a pick up time a hour after mine was served her turkey which looked Golden and was actually larger than the one we received. We tried to call and speak to a manager who has not been available since Friday which I understand due to the holiday but this is not good for business this runied my holiday no one ate the burnt turkey which was a waste of money."}
{"text":"Service is non existent here. Don't expect it. Servers are young and ghetto fabulous. Tables are not sectioned so servers are everywhere. We arrived and were seated. Took our order only to tell us that they ran out of certain dishes and that we should have came earlier. We waited 2 hours and our food still had not come out. Kitchen was chaotic. Servers arguing with the cooks. This place needs some organization and new management. Guess I won't be coming here again!"}
{"text":"Love the food. But you better be ready for rude, lazy, uninspired service. It's a shame to, because the cook is good."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Best chicken and waffles!! Smothered chicken is juicy,  not dry.

Tip: Their biscuits and corn bread pancakes are super addictive! !  I'd come just for those alone."}
{"text":"Yeah, sorry I was not impressed. I have never had sweet greens before, what was that about, and the mac and cheese, not great. My liver and onions were good, but the potatoes?? It seems like they have all the sides ready and then they just heat them up. I was not impressed. This was the Mayweather fight weekend, the waitress was more interested in the male patrons..sheesh"}
{"text":"Ordered BBQ chicken whole (which is a breast and two legs), with the sides macaroni, mashed potatoes, greens. They all tasted bland, especially the greens. Save your money, you can make the same thing at home."}
{"text":"Sooooo... I preface this by saying soul food is a very personal thing. Unlike other types of food you are often molded by your upbringing. How auntie so-and-so made her greens often becomes the benchmark for good greens. Same for fried chicken and BBQ. That being said I think the food was just mediocre. We opted for the original location and not the one on the strip based in fellow yelpers who exposed their growing pains of being the new location. That being said the ambiance is that if an around the way soul food joint. Expect little by way of decor, photos of celebs and blaring wall mounted TVs bare tables is the basic aesthetic. The service was fine but my expectations were low and not because of M&M but because I'm used to around the way soul food spots. Low on customer service high on great tasting food. This time the servers were on it and acknowledged us quickly, let us seat ourselves and then quickly took drink and food orders. We ordered the full orders of the fried chicken wings and BBQ chicken with candied yams, collard greens, black eyed peas and potato salad. The short of it.... The food was just meh. The BBQ chicken was simply baked chicken with BBQ sauce. Lazy. The fried chicken appeared crunchy and was seasoned well from what my dinner guest said. The sides were just ok...not particularly well seasoned and not outright bland. I would probably go back just to try other things in the menu as I think I may have ordered the wrong thing. I encourage you to try them out and support this business that is off of the strip. You can hv high end chain restaurants on the other days you are in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, affordable prices, and downright GREAT tasting food!  I've been here a few times and will definitely be returning.  The only drawback, though, is the location.  It's not in the safest of neighborhoods.  When the sun goes down, the area can give off a pretty sketchy vibe.  I wouldn't let my mother walk alone at night in this neighborhood.  This place still deserves a 5-star rating, though!"}
{"text":"Not really impressed. Ordered fried chicken full for carryout. Asked for all thighs, they said no problem. Got mac and cheese, yams and potato salad as sides. Got home, had two legs and a thigh. Chicken was dry. Mac and Cheese was ok, nothing to the yams or potato salad. Might try the breakfast but don't get the hype. I wish them luck."}
{"text":"Service was terrible, we waited almost 2 hours for our food, no type of customer service, staff was all over the place. Think they lost our order. Not a great 1st experience. Everyone around us had no food. Extremely irritating. Management needs to step in and do something."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things, wish I could be a regular here! 5 stars on the quality and taste of the food and amazing service to top it all off! A restaurant.com coupon brought us here during a visit from San Diego. The fried chicken was the best I've ever had and so were the collard greens. We also had the catfish and grilled pork chop w onions and peppers (special request) amazing!!!!  Eat here if you like soul food!"}
{"text":"Some of the worst food I've ever eaten. First let me start by saying that the wait time to order our drinks was approx 15 mins. My date had to go find menus and let the waitress know that once again we're here. The food awful. The greens were salty and tasted like they're straight from a can, and if they're not, I have to say that someone has a special skill if they can make a collard green taste that bad. The cornbread dressing was a stiff blob of something with once again gravy that appeared to be from a jar or a can. The cabbage was the saving grace but for the fact that it had very little seasoning. The fried chicken was inconsistent, the wings were a tad greasy but weren't dried out like the chicken breast. The mac n cheese tastes like it looks, like dried paste. Look at the pictures that are posted they will tell you everything you need to know. There is no love and definitely no soul used in making the food at M&M. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Look, I'm from the south, deep south, and this is where you find the best soul food anywhere! I've been to M&M several times, and the food is good. My complaint, is with the corn bread! Like I said, I/m from the deep south, and down there, you'll see what corn bread is all about! Those two dime sized pancakes, is not corn bread, and they have even gotten smaller! Look, if you are going to consider yourselves a bonafide soul food restaurant, you need to take a trip to the deep south, and learn what cornbread is all about. Your other food is delicious, but you have to tighten up on the bread!"}
{"text":"Very satisfied with the food preparation and overall taste. Server Lexi was very cordial professional and a take-charge individual. We were all pleased with our overall experience and will spread the word about the Charleston location. We will come again. Kudos to the chefs."}
{"text":"This place is delicious and a must try! We came here twice and truly appreciated the service each time a and the food. We can rant and rave about the catfish and the chicken wings. We had them both times because it's cooked so well. The best sides are: potato salad, green beans and rice w gravy. Also, their prices are unbeatable."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this location. I have visited Los Angeles Cali locations over the years and they are great. I enjoyed the meal however the portion of catfish was small and the cabbage had no seasoning at all. It tasted as if it were the last left in the pot. My fam ordered the chicken and that seemed to be a better choice. The lemonade needs sugar..It may sound picky however I hope they read the reviews. These small changes can make a huge difference since the cost is at the top of the scale. I want to compliment the servers that work here. They are on top of their game. I will return to try again since I love fried chicken."}
{"text":"Customer service is the worst! If anyone answers the phone, you're on hold for 30 mins, at least. I was trying to place an order to pick up and was on hold for so long my husband drive there and ordered before anyone picked the phone up again. We called again last night to order and the employee was rude and wanted me to pay for my order ahead of tome because she \"wasn't gonna have a ticket open under her name\" we cancelled the order and went elsewhere. I couldn't imagine the owners are aware or accept this type of behavior."}
{"text":"Excellent, FAST service! The fried chicken was light and crispy, just perfect. I LOVED the yams and the macaroni was good as well. My husband also had black eyed peas and red beans and rice and was crazy for those also. We really enjoyed the corn cakes they give you before the meal. Overall great experience, I would go here more but it's a bit out of the way for us."}
{"text":"Was hesitant to eat here at first bc of the reviews about the service but it actually wasn't too bad. Food was good and didn't take as long as the review said. Fried chicken and oxtail over a bed of rice and gravy was yummy. I had greens, yams, potato salad and they were all delish. Corn cakes were also good"}
{"text":"So I saw an old menu that showed they were open at breakfast and work had pretzled my brain and I needed a minute of decompression.  I got there 3 minutes before their new hours showed they opened and clearly the guy that was there to open the place was out in front on the phone.  

Did he want to put down the phone and take care of a customer that was 3 minutes early cuz the new hours weren't announced anywhere... No.  Went to L & L Hawaiian Barbeque a few steps away and got some snackies and decompressed my brain and as I drove past M&M as I was leaving - with no customers I had to wonder about the commitment of the place."}
{"text":"Unprofessional poor service, but not all the servers just mine! My food was salty and lacked flavor. This place was highly recommend to me, but I wouldn't recommend it! Maybe the other location is better."}
{"text":"I came and expected to get my taste buds a real treat! My waitress was nice but my food wasn't hot at all! I ordered meatloaf mac & cheese and mash potatoes... I was told they ran out of mash potatoes so I ordered rice & gravy! The meatloaf was tasty but cold and the mac & cheese wasn't that tasty at all! The rice and gravy was alright! The environment nice and spacious not too loud! It only took about 20 mins for my order to come out!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Everytime we are in vegas we try to get in there for the best fried chicken and mac and cheese there is."}
{"text":"Place was dirty, slow service, loud talking waitresses,,,you could hear them from the kitchen, food was mediocre at best. Kind of scary if you ask me"}
{"text":"This food was AMAZING!!! I am shocked how good the waffle, chicken, pork chop and eggs were prepared.  If you can get here, stop in and get something."}
{"text":"Came to lunch with my girlfriend ... Good Southern food and the staff is amazing !! Luv Angie & Stephanie !! I will say it was a Lil hot in there, turn the air down :)"}
{"text":"We love coming here everytime we in town. I actually miss it when im in l.a.
Very good food, my favorite oxtail and corn bread. Nice people. We actually ate there twice on this trip. Thats how good their food"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of the chicken or the fish. This place is as close as I'll get to grandmas cooking for sure!"}
{"text":"Thumbs down for me meatloaf wasnt cooked long enuff and mashes potatoes had black mold spots the worst i have had and in city . But service was friendly and prompt!"}
{"text":"Found this place on purely by chance. Nice, neighborhood environment. Had the fried catfish, greens and cornbread. Generous portions; took a bit home for later. Loved it. Not as far from home as some others. Everyone was courteous, friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Fried chicken and cat fish are the best. All side dishes are tasty. Sometimes a long wait, but worth it. Good prices."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for the most juicy and tinder  Oxtails I've ever had period... I've had other soul food spots Oxtails but these are the best! The gravy they put on them is the finishing touches to excellence..."}
{"text":"Good service good prices, i loved the place. Only negative is that is on the sketchy side of the strip over by the stratosphere. It has a good atmosphere"}
{"text":"Kool-Aid was awesome!
Our waitress was awesome!
The food was ok. I wasn't a fan of the wheat waffles or pancakes  and the rice was pretty gross for it to be a soul food place...stick to the grits but we had a good experience and the food came out on time so overall it was good."}
{"text":"The outside not so nice but inside is nice.... Service was excellent and super Friendly (Jerria)! I had meatloaf it was ok my hubby had fried chicken that was awesome... My son had chicken and waffles and ate it all! Ok my review on the food the sweet tea and cool aid was very good! The green beans, Mac n cheese and greens was good not great. The cornbread stuffing with gravy was bomb! The cornbread pancakes were awesome! We will go back!"}
{"text":"This I believe my second time being to M&M \"Soul\" Food Cafe and once again I'm not impressed. But at least last time I got quality customer service.
Let's start off with the fact that we came through the door, the three of us and weren't greeted more the less  even acknowledged. Then once we do get seated were we asked about a drink or something to start us off? NO not all. Okay I big deal maybe she'll come back in a minute or two. Lol no we weren't asked about drink for at least 15-20 minutes, in fact she didn't even ask about a damn drink she went straight to asking what we wanted to order (with no type of emotion, smile, or anything, like she was a damn zombie with an attitude). The sad thing is that they weren't that busy at all yet other people that were coming in were getting asked what they wanted to order and drink. And let's not forget also receiving their cornbread pancakes as a little appetizer while they wait for their food. We couldn't even get that much. So drink and no appetizer that you're supposed to give every table plus you have a fat attitude when you come to take my order? Um no. Definitely will not be back. And it's sad to say that because as a black female you don't expect to be treated like that at a soul food restaurant nor by other black females but sadly that's exactly what this was.
 And don't get me wrong I work in the food industry and I completely understand how a shift can be crappy as hell!As a young woman in the food industry I know that those girls could've just had the worst shift of their life but that doesn't mean you treat customers like trash. Do your job and make your money and get your tips or go home. It's that simple! Don't get in the customer service industry if you can't handle the heat! It's literally just disgusting to see plus your food isn't that good at all! Then the fact that a full meal is only 2 measly pieces of fish and some gross sides. Macaroni is barely warm and tasteless. The red beans and rice tastes worst than the box stuff. And the green beans were trash too! At least get one of these things customer service or the food but having both that are shitty is just plain horrible. Sorry I'm not a typical ratchet that comes in there everyday. I guess next time I'll come in a lot more ghetto. That's all"}
{"text":"I took a trip to Vegas with my mother back in April. We decided to try this place. Let's just say it was the worst experience ever. We sat down at a table and waited and waited. The waitresses just walked right past us. We then decided that we would just leave since they obviously didn't want our service. As we were walking out the chef and/or counter person yelled THANK YOU as we walked out the door. I've never in my life have been treated so poorly and rude! I noticed that the place closed by a previous review. My response to that is that it probably closed due to the horrible rude staff!"}
{"text":"I was raised on good soul food, so I look for a specific taste. Was a little apprehensive at first because no place is like home, but my husband and I gave it a shot. From the first step in the door, the customer service was great. We were greeted immediately. It was awesome to see Kool-Aid on the menu...what a great addition. My husband ordered the fried chicken dinner and I indulged in the oxtails. For a picky soul food eating girl, I was COMPLETELY satisfied. The gravy was awesome and DID NOT taste like flour or cornstarch. The chicken was fried to perfection. The sides, especially the yams were good. 

I wish I could remember the waitress name...she was so friendly and attentive. She was a lighter toned young girl with a colorful tattoo on her arm...She, solely on her customer service had us sold. Cannot forget the security guard. Great team and great food equals happy customers!!!

Now that we live in Las Vegas, we will surely be back."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by my dad who loves checking out restaurants when he travels. The food here is good from the oxtails to the fried Okra, but I don't recommend coming here in the evening as service can be much slower than during breakfast or in the afternoon.

My family and I waited in the seating area for 15 minutes, and I didn't understand why such a long wait because there was empty seating in parts of the restaurant. After we were finally seated and placed our orders, we were given hot cakes, which were good and soft. A great combination! Our waiter was very friendly and welcoming, though she made a mistake on our orders, she was quick to rectify them and offered us complimentary sides with dessert. Sometimes things happen that are beyond our control and we can only move forward and control our own actions, and our waiter handled hers very well. 

I would highly recommend this place. Just be sure to come earlier in the day for a more speedy service."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience there I had breakfast there first it was wonderful the atmosphere and customer was great not to mention tha food was hott and well season.. I returned a couple of days later for the oxtails they was great too"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food!! Had the porkchops, greens, Mac and cheese, and black eyed peas!! Jerria our server was also great too!! Will definitely return when I come back to Vegas!!"}
{"text":"So, I had never been to a \"soul food\" restaurant before and really wasn't sure what to expect, food wise, but already knew what I was going to order... Chicken and waffles! Best decision I ever made... Ok, not really, but as far as \"soul food\" goes it was!

The chicken was perfectly seasoned and delicious and I'm not a huge fan of waffles/pancakes, but the waffles were THE BEST I have ever had! 

The wait staff were super friendly and attentive.

The second time around (different trip), the food was not as good as I remember. I had the smothered pork chops (seriously amazing!) and three sides. I believe I got mac & cheese and potato salad. The portion was HUGE, and what I didn't realize is I got the full order (option for half order), so unless you have a big appetite, I suggest getting the half order. The sides were less than satisfying... Mac & Cheese was so-so and the potato salad was just gross. 

The wait staff the second time around were less attentive, but it also was alot busier.

Though the second visit wasn't as good as the first, I still really enjoy the food and will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I had my first chicken and waffles for breakfast here.  The chicken wings are really good!  The waffle was okay.  My waitress was really friendly.

Get the muddy water, pretty refreshing."}
{"text":"I am a disabled veteran with a service dog was denied service was told we do not allow any animals in this place company policy"}
{"text":"Came here about 2 PM EST coming off my flight to Vegas before my hotel check-in. Was hungry and figured I get something to eat since I just arrived in town. Came in and sat at the counters area you see as you enter. The place had enough customers to be busy and by the way, everyone was moving around you'd think it was much busier. Was disappointed by the wait. Yep, they were busy, but it took longer than need be for someone to ask what I wanted and take my order. Thankfully ANGIE was great! Despite having her hands full, she took the time to check on me, take my order and give me some cornbread to start. I watched as all the servers hustled, the chef's coordinated things with them and one dude who acted like a manager but looked like he was a customer walked the kitchen area. About that: Bad Idea to have a wide open kitchen/serving area. Despite having a low wall to block the direct view of the kitchen, I could still see how everything operated in the kitchen. Back Of House....Keep that view away from the customers. It was no doubt part of the reason why a guy who came in ten minutes after I did leave when no one waited on him.

With all that, my food finally came and you know what? It was delicious! The battery on my phone drained otherwise I'd have taken a picture of my order of short ribs, red beans and rice, greens and fried okra. The beef was tender and leaving me wanting more. The greens? Well, I can eat just about any greens, but these were a bit dry but still great. The Red Beans and Rice were not New Orleans but still good and the fried okra wasn't how I usually have them, but that may change because I liked how they were done. I left full and happy except for that wait time and the architectural blunder of seeing the behind the scenes activity of the staff. The manager-looking guy should also consider dressing as professionally as his servers and chefs. But Angie was fantastic and the food was great. It's A-OK with me but I'd reconsider when I'd come in. I also chatted up a cutie customer who was coming for take out who told me of another location. I'd be curious to see how they operate. But, want a soul food fix in Vegas and willing to deal with these drawbacks? Then, by all means, check this place out!"}
{"text":"Building is old, the inside is... different but the food was actually pretty good. Their waffles are better than Ella Ems but that was about it. Oxtail was decent, their sides (mac/potato salad/mash) were decent. The service was very good though.  

This is a place i'd try again if i was in the area."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience ever. Horrible customer service. Food took over an hour to come out and when it finally came out it was cold. Waitress (Shekinah) never asked how we were, if she could fill our drinks again. They were overall unprofessional (arguing with each other in front of customers). Never again will I visit this establishment."}
{"text":"We stopped here to eat while in Vegas. The food was awesome! Everyone was super nice too. Big portions for the money. I told all my friends to go there. Can't say enough!!"}
{"text":"Poor representation of soul food. If this is what Mississippi soul food taste like I would never visit Mississippi.  If I could give this place zero stars I would. For as long as the wait was you would have thought the food would at least be ok, the food was disgusting. I ordered fried snapper with the yams and mac. I noticed the patrons beside me all ordered yams as well and no one touched the yams, I asked how the yams were and they said it was disgusting. I should have took their word. The mac and cheese was watery as if they poured sauce on the mac but never baked it. I tried my husbands collard greens and they were extremely sweet. My fish was coated in grease, so I sent it back. I instead ordered okra because I was at that point starving. The okra was swimming in grease. I sent the okra back too. The yams were ridiculously sweet and tasted like they came out of a can. I wish I would have listened to the patrons next to me and just left. Please save your money.

I included a picture of the napkin that I used to drain the grease from the okra. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!"}
{"text":"With a city like Las Vegas with all the flashing lights and glamor and food prepared by a guy who's name you cant begin to pronounce it's very simple to overlook a place like this.

FIVE FRIGGIN STARS
If it wasn't for other Yelpers i never would have came across this place. 

The place is nice very clean very casual diner type environment. 
The food is a bit pricey but that's because portions are HUGE and the fact they offer half orders is awesome.
This isnt fast food so dont expect to be in and out in a heart beat they actually take time to COOK your food not just heat it up.

Ox Tail - Very nicely cooked lots of tendon and VERY tender WIN
Fried Chicken - Came out hot fresh, tastes great WIN
Wings n Waffles - This is my new breakfast, something about the home made waffles makes it lighter and crispier EPIC WIN
Short Ribs - Had them with the BBQ sauce gotta try gravy next time VERY tender WIN
Fried Okra - Something about it is just pure WIN
Mac and Cheese - Again something about it makes it WIN

The only Fail is we asked for water a few times and it never came, so if you're gonna want something later on in the meal order it as your ordering your food

Overall - EPIC WIN"}
{"text":"They get a 4 because the person who took my order was really nice and they season their chicken really well. They didn't get a 5 because the chicken was dry, to clarify I did get white meat but I've never encountered this texture from other restaurants, and it was a boneless chicken breast with very little skin which is my favorite part. The sides were pretty good but the greens were a little lacking in flavor. For as packed as they were on a Sunday the floors were pretty clean and that's definitely a plus. I would come back again if I were in the area."}
{"text":"I must say, this place has great chicken! So Fresh, crunchy, and not too salty! The tea and lemonade was also great! I'm so full with all the sides they have to offer! Not a bad price either! 

The vibe with the waitresses were awesome. The customers are very friendly and everyone talks to everyone! Ha ha ha! 

Great choice and off the strip! My papi did it again and found a local joint!"}
{"text":"I got some food and it  we pretty good . Cat fish , red beans and rice and Mac and cheese pretty good"}
{"text":"Got here at 3 pm on a sunday for brunch and the wait was terrible a hot 30 min to an hour to be seated when there are clearly empty tables available. You hAve to sign your name on the notebook when you arrive. Overall, though the food seasoning and taste make up for it. The prices are reasonable. Good portion sizes. Small parking lot. I recommend taking uber to get here. Once you order the food came out quickly. And this was legit country soul food. There is full size and half size food orders. The full size comes with two pieces of meat and three sides. The half size comes with one piece of meat and two sides. Great portion for price paid. Overall i got three meals and spent $70. Including 2 fruit punches. I highly recommend the fried catfish. Mac cheese and collard greens with fruit punch."}
{"text":"We hadn't been to M&M in quite some time, and the only reason we came today was because we were coming from the HarvestFestival and my husband wanted some meatloaf. I'm not crazy about the place, it reminds me of an old time \"greasy spoon\"....which is cool if it's DAMN good food and you're in the mood for it. The Soul food here is OK if you don't know how to cook soul food yourself. ANYWAY, I wasn't really hungry and I saw they had Fried Green Tomatoes which I LOVE....so I ordered some. It was under appetizers, and the price was $6.95. Well DAYUM I thought, we must be getting a nice big plate of Fried Green Tomatoes at that price...RIGHT!!?
NOPE, Think Again...
(I'm gonna try and post a pic)
The waitress (she was nice), but when she brought me a saucer with 3...yes I said THREE slices of FRIED Green Tomatoes, I must've looked at her like I was cray-cray!! I said SERIOUSLY, 3 SLICES FOR $6.95!!!???? She was like, yeah we just raised all our prices, they WERE $4.95. I was like that's STILL TOO MUCH...this isn't even a whole tomato!! My husband was like G, just chill... I wasn't yelling at her or anything, I was just astounded thinking WE ain't on the STRIP for god sake. So she eventually brought me 2 more slices...which was like whateva. 
They were decent, of course I make'm better!! 
He liked his meatloaf, the Mac and cheese was dry, like they'd scraped the corner of the pan for the last bit. So...yeah overall, I'm totally NOT impressed! And they really REALLY need to lower the price, or just take the dang Fried Green Tomatoes OFF the MENU at THAT PRICE....that just don't make NO GD CENTS!"}
{"text":"This was my 1st and only time to review this place. After reading reviews of their shrimp and grits, I decieded to give it a try. I couldn't wait to get some; however I wish I had!
The grits were super bland which my blood pressure probably went up a few points due to all the salt I had to put in them just to give it a tad bit of flavor.  The shrimp had a boiled taste to them with very little flavor besides the bell pepper taste. The gravy on top tasted like oil or oily taste. Overall, it was a bad choice.
Now on to the chicken n waffles. The chicken was hot and fresh with a decent flavor. The waffles were delicious with a taste of cinnamon goodness 

Initially ordered catfish and quickly changed my mind after being told of portion size of fish. For $17, it wasn't worth it, downright robbery IMO. I would expect a large fillet for that price, not 3 skimpy pieces not larger than 3 of my fingers.

The overall environment was clean and dimly lit. The tables were too close together as by back was nearly touching the person behind us.

Waitress: Greeted us as soon as we walked in and seated us asking for our drink orders before we even sat down. Chose water which was brought out in mini mason jars. Not sure if they had free refils for other beverages, but for the size I sure hope so.

I really hoped to like this place cause I Love Love Love some good soul food. I guess I will continue on my search for it."}
{"text":"The servers are nice. A little unprofessional and the element around the outside wanders in and makes you feel uncomfortable.  The food portions are too small for the prices. The flavors are subpar. Yams, macaroni and cheese, and cabbage had no flavor or spices at all. Yams tasted like they were straight from nature with no sugar. The cornbread pancakes or whatever were dry and tasteless. The $1.50 up charge for white meat chicken is ridiculous! Especially when the white meat is 2 chicken wings and a thigh! I cannot believe this crap. I feel like I was robbed. I used to frequent other locations in California, but this location has turned me off."}
{"text":"OMG this place is sooo good! I got the fried chicken, mac n cheese, and collards! Fried chicken was so seasoned and fried to perfection! Boyfriend got the smothered chicken, yams, and mac n cheese. He couldn't stop smacking his lips! It was delicious. We also got a bowl of shrimp and grits and shared it...everyone needs to try this place! Great soul food! About to try their sweet potato pie! Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Complimentary corn bread was just right. Chicken was well seasoned and juicy.  Fried Okra was pretty good as well. I wish the Mac and cheese was more cheesy and well seasoned but that's just my personal taste. Service was great and fast! I'm reserving that one star mainly cause of the markup of the meal, but I guess I'm paying for the brand. Idk that that it should cost $15 for a 2 piece and 2 little sides though. Overall, pretty good first experience. Might come back to try the pork chop next time."}
{"text":"Nice service but hair in Mac and cheese Roscoe's in la is way better. Chicken is good. I had BBQ chicken but she had friend chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"Read reviews here...I'm from the south so I was excited to try the food.  Unfortunately I was so disapointed.  Love cornbread but the thin fried cakes were very greasy and I'm not fond of sweet cornbread. Mac and cheese was lumpy and not much cheese flavor? My short ribs were awful.  We're probably cooked several days ago, no flavor at all...only tried a couple of bites., and the gravy was awful..funny taste,the fried okra was like you get at any place, frozen and dropped in deep fryer.  One of my favs black eyed peas were so overcooked they were mush.  Overall nothing on my plate was even a little bit tasty.My husband liked his 2 small pieces of catfish, nice and tasty but for $16.99...with unappetizing sides...NOPE!  I'll still be on the search for good southern food here in Vegas.  Last comment the music was deafening so we had hard time conversing over our \"icky\" food!'"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located a mile from my home. My wife and I have eaten there perhaps 20 times of the last few years. The food is excellent. We enjoy the Southern style food  that they produce.
The restaurant is owned and staffed mostly by black people. As much as I enjoy the food, I cannot go back there due to the hostile anti-white prejudice that we have consistently experienced over the years.

We went there last night about 7 PM. We sat down and were promptly greeted and our orders taken. They serve two small corn cakes as a free appetizer, but, it seem, only if you are black. After waiting 45 minutes without receiving our food, and seeing other customers who arrived well after we did served their food, my wife got up and asked the manager if we could have our food. After she did that, the food was brought to the table promptly. It was delicious, we paid our ticket and left. This has been a very consistent pattern over the years. If you are black, you will be served promptly. If you are white, you can plan on sitting for a long time and being ignored. I understand that everyone wants to live in a post racist world, but this is ridiculous. And as much as I enjoy their food, I am most doubtful that we will return."}
{"text":"Very interesting little place. Very authentic southern food. I had the fried chicken with Mac and cheese and fried ocre. All very good, I'm giving four stars because I felt like the menu was a little small, like I wanted more choices on food. But overall, good for some fried chicken and waffles! Good service, too!"}
{"text":"You will not find better Fried Chicken in this town. In fact, you may not find better Chicken West of the Mississippi River. Other things to try: Corned Beef Hash for breakfast, Fried Catfish, and Meat Loaf, are items not to miss! ENJOY!!!!!"}
{"text":"All I wanted to do was get a chance to dig into what I had heard was the best representation of Soul Food in the valley... I never got the chance.

We headed to M&M with a mixed group of friends (and by mixed, I am talking about ethnicity/race). There were no booths/tables big enough for our group, so we sat at a few different tables. After waiting well over ten minutes, my wife and I had no water, no welcome, nothing. Tables around us had food. Tables from our group that included at least one African American had their drinks/orders taken, but even after my wife went to the ladies room, we had not even been spoken to (most likely had not been looked at...) 

There was no shortage of staff, since I saw several employees standing around near the cashier area.

Once we realized that we were being blatantly ignored, we left. I thought we (as a society) were above this type of behavior. I feel like I should look into taking action to bring the media into the situation (much like Denny's in the 1990's, no restaurant should act this way.) Last time I checked, my blood was just as red as the next guys, and my money every bit as green. 

This whole in the wall will never get anything but extremely negative press from me.  If you have any desire for real equality in this day and age, you won't go there either."}
{"text":"Hands down this is some good soul food. I had some fried pork chops and the food was the bomb.  MAc and cheese, yams were good as well- i really didn't care for the greens(something was missing).

Yummy yummy yummy"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I found this place on restaurants.com while in Vegas. We left stuffed and everything tasted amazing! 

The staff was attentive and super nice, worth the drive from the strip. Our food came quick and piping hot. Our fave part of the menu was KOOLAID! Brought us back to our childhood. 

I had the smothered fried chicken (dark meat) with fried okra and red beans and rice topped with banana pudding for dessert. 
The boyfriend had fried chicken, mixed meat; okra, mac and cheese, and rice and gravy with peach cobbler for dessert."}
{"text":"Went around 6 on a Saturday for take out smothered pork chops, Mac and cheese, and yams. Sat at the counter. Everything coming out of the kitchen looked great. My food was amazing. Seasoned perfectly. Texture and taste was everything. Like it was made to order. Mad I only have one more day left, but they'll see me again for breakfast. Could've had a bigger portion, but that could just be me wanting more;). Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Amazing service and food!
Couldn't have been happier choosing this location to sit down and have an authentic soul food meal!!!"}
{"text":"Fried chicken is solid, but not spectacular. Waffles are a bit soggy. Great corn cakes. Rice and beans were so so, as was mac and cheese."}
{"text":"M & M is an unbelievably consistent operation, as I have never been disappointed with the service or food here in the numerous occasions I have visited so far.  I have never walked in without being greeted politely, and having my muddy water (arnold palmer) and corbread cake served up immediately.  The fried chicken is always good, and I even tried the catfish the other day, excellent.  They do run out of sides on occasion, but no big deal as they have plenty of others.  An unexpected, amazing feat of service and quality from an unassuming joint off Charleston."}
{"text":"Being from Houston I am very sensitive about my soul food. My friends n I gave it an early overall 3.5 stars. 
Pros: 
Clean and the owner is very personable. He came out and greeted us. 
Fairly priced.
My short ribs wrere really good although cold.
Yams were really good.
Cons:
Fish was a bit salty.
Service was kinda good but kinda slow
Some of the food was cold
Greens were really bad.
Beans n rice - ok. 
Cabbage- ok."}
{"text":"The two stars are ONLY because our waitress was sweet and so was the cornbread. I agree with the previous reviews they take a long time to seat you. I saw three tables leave and everyone is waiting for their food for 45 minutes or more. There is a disclaimer on the menu that fried items take 20 minutes...but my oxtail was old my mom and grandma got some weird looking shortrib...both of which came out cold. The only thing that was good were my father's blackeyed peas and my greens. The location on Charleston is wayyyyy better but they are currently under construction. #sadday"}
{"text":"This is a must if you're in Vegas. This hidden gem has very authentic and great tasting food. Everything was freshly made and served to perfection. This place gets busy and you might have a little wait, but it's worth it! Staff is very nice and accommodating."}
{"text":"So, review of M&M Soul Food From Mississippi on Charleston & Valley View...
I got baked chicken (dark meat) with mashed potatoes & collard greens.
The chicken wouldn't have had flavor if it wasn't COVERED in gravy. The mashed potatoes were good, but who would know since they were also covered in gravy that is really salty....and the collard greens???? Usually Mississippi folks cook stuff to death, but they forgot to finish these. Super firm and big chucks...and they put SUGAR in them!

Only redeeming thing is the cornbread pancakes....good & just a little sweet.

Also, $12 for a meat and 2 is a little much. Only a leg and thigh..."}
{"text":"Love the food here the service is always great... if u want good food come to the one on Charleston Blvd in Las Vegas!!!!"}
{"text":"I am not claiming to be a soul food expert as I grew up in Montana. BUT we did live in Mississippi for 2 years and have had our fair share of awesome soul food while living there. 

We found this place on accident and were joking about eating there, until I checked Yelp on my phone and saw the great reviews. Sold. We turned around and have been hooked ever since.

The cornbread pancakes are so good and complimentary. The staff is friendly and attentive. (Even on mother's day when the place was PACKED with a line out the door. We still got drinks refilled and timely/friendly service.) I haven't ventured beyond the fried chicken but my husband has had the short ribs and said they were delicious. 

If I was on death row my last meal request would be this place's smothered fried chicken, collard greens, mac n cheese, and fried okra."}
{"text":"I didn''t even get to try the food because the wait was over an hour just for someone to acknowledge you. The system they have in place just to seat someone is beyond ridiculous. 

Write you name down in a spiral notebook to even place a to go order. Once your name is called and you say you would like a to go order, you are seated at the counter and wait another 30 minutes! 

I left hungry, AIN'T NO FOOD that good. 

Maybe next time I can say something about the food."}
{"text":"This is an actual soul food restaurant there were people standing outside the door at 10 and it fills up pretty fast the service is very I got my coffee when or actually after my food came the food came nice and hot everything was great. I changed my stars from 3 to 4 because the food was really good even though the service was slow but again it was busy we spent about an hour in the restaurant waiting on the food and eating"}
{"text":"It seems like every year at this time I'm in search of food from home. Of course I wanted to get my black-eyed peas and collard greens, but I had a craving for home cooking so to google I went. I had heard about this place and after finding out that no one in town has Chicken and Dressing, I figured I'd get some Meatloaf plus they had okra and mashed potatoes. I was ready

It's New Years Day so needless to say that I wasn't the only one who wanted to get some good luck for the new year. It wasn't even noon and the place was PACKED. I thought it was a great sign that I was one of only two white people in the place. It's kind of a family diner kind of place but that's fine by me. Everyone was super friendly when I walked in and I only had to wait maybe 5 minutes before I was sat. They also had the football game on so I was set. 

I quickly ordered sweet tea while I looked over the menu. I decided to go all out and got a Half Order of Meatloaf, black-eyed peas, collard greens, mashed potatoes and gravy, and friend okra. The food came out very quickly and I was pleasantly surprised with everything. 

I'm definitely glad I went and left feeling full. It's good to know that there are some good places like this in Las Vegas when I need to get my Southern food fix. As someone from Mississippi, I can tell you that this place is legit."}
{"text":"I don't know if I came on a bad day or what, but I didn't enjoy the food here. The staff and atmosphere was great and friendly, don't get me wrong. I just didn't enjoy the food as much as I thought I would. I ordered the catfish and oxtail, which were actually really good! It's just the sides that were below par. The macaroni was bland and didn't taste much like cheese at all. Even the table behind me made a complaint to the waitress about the macaroni. The greens were cut into strips, which was a little weird, and they weren't soft or flavorful like how good greens usually are. The mashed potatoes and gravy was very bland also, with no real flavor. I think the sides are just important as the main dish, so the poor quality of the sides really hurt this restaurant from shining as a good soul food spot in Las Vegas. Maybe I'll take another trip in a few months to see if they've made any changes."}
{"text":"Nice casual sit down. Food that definitely fills your stomach. Great service as well. Recommend to anyone for some soul food."}
{"text":"Well to start my expectations for this restaurant was a little on the low side since I've been slightly disappointed at other soul food restaurants. They haven't been bad but definitely not on par to real southern soul food. This one right here was not only delicious but far far exceeded my expectations. Everything I ate was the bomb! I sampled from my husband's plate and his smothered liver was perfection. My best friend's red snapper looked right out of a magazine and tasted divine! If you haven't tried this M&M Soul Food restaurant I advise you to do so. No disappointments her! You'll love it!"}
{"text":"As a native of Louisiana who has also lived in Mississippi, I love me some good soul food. 

After several trips, I can safely say that M&M's food is legit and authentic; but I have reserved judgment in giving a rating in hopes that they could improve their service quality. Unfortunately, after last night's experience, I was convinced that it is not going to get any better any time soon. 

I arrived about 7 pm and the restaurant was not very busy with approximately 10 customers. I sat at the bar prepared to place a take-out order and **20** minutes later, the waitress finally took my order (fried pork chops, collard greens, mac & cheese, black-eyed peas). During that time, she asked the women sitting **next** to me three times what their order was (they were being very indecisive). 

**45** minutes after that, I finally received my order. In the meantime, I experienced the following:

-2 take out orders fulfilled. 
-The women next to me being hit on by the cook. And the cook giving them a free side order to try to win their favor.
-The waitress helping the women next to me as they didn't like their food and getting them replacements.
-The waitress asking me two additional times what my side items were
-The waitress not acknowledging me in any other way (e.g., I'm sorry about the wait, would you like some water, etc.) during that time.
-Did not receive the complimentary cornbread appetizer that is custom and other tables received.
-The kitchen running out of the side items I ordered.
-Lukewarm food when it finally arrived.
-No \"thank you\" or \"sorry\" when the bill came. 

I sat there patiently for this entire time. Maybe I should have spoken up but I didn't want to be disrespectful so perhaps that's on me.  And since I'm from the south, I get that we have a different pace of life there but service here has consistently been mediocre to poor with poor being more prevalent as of recent as I experienced last night. 

I just can't ever see myself going to the restaurant again for the forseeable future."}
{"text":"Went for a quick dinner. I gotta say, from beginning to end, this place was fantastic. I really enjoy their food. I ate the Short Ribs 1/2 Order, wow, tenderness all the way. And I gotta say, Tonisha and Honey are 2 of the most awesome people, they are super friendly and make you feel at home (really the whole staff, but today both of these  ladies stood out). Getting back to the food, it was great, the short ribs were tender, and the collard greens were very tasty, no bitter like in some other places I've been. The one thing was that I had a hot link appetizer and it was over cooked just a bit and dry inside, but I blame myself because I ordered it after I got my dinner. 

I have also been here for breakfast/early lunch, and they breakfast items are really good. Everyone here makes you feel at home.

Thank you All."}
{"text":"We had a large party of 22 & although we couldn't make reservations, we didn't have to wait long too order and were seated within 5 minutes. It was a Sunday, so we went at 12:30 to avoid the after church rush. Never thought I would be able to find such good soul food in viva las Vegas. It's great, I always get the smothered chicken, greens, & Mac & cheese. The sweet tea/lemonade mix is awesome & the service is great! The owner was even running around hustling & bustling with a constant cheerful demeanor."}
{"text":"Got a carry out order... Fried chicken had little flavor...the beans & rice smelled of smoke when opened the package...Not edible... They forgot the cornbread order... The banana pudding was good... 1st time & last time for us."}
{"text":"Can we please get a a half way decent Soul food restaurant. Not super bad but not great. I had the Oxtail they were ok, mac and cheese didn't have any cheese in it, Collard greens had more stems then greens. The yams were really good."}
{"text":"The corn pancakes are the stars of this restaurant. It sets your palate up for the greasy salty fried chicken. Arnold Palmer is a must to wash down some of the grease lingering in the esophagus. Food comes at a Southern pace too. It's OK though, just eat more corn pancakes. Service is excellent and the owner swings by every so often. Southern hospitality! Reminds me of my childhood in Mississippi (I have to sing the song every time I spell this state)!"}
{"text":"The bomb.com off the chain!!! A must visit food off the chain amd the service is great make ya feel right at home!!!"}
{"text":"Is sad to have a restaurant on the strip and have over 40-50 people here  am ready to be served but they tell you 30 minutes to wait to be call to a table and than it will be a whole hour before you can get our food thats a damm shame and we don't even get cornbread to eat on while we wait for that damm hour."}
{"text":"After being referred here by my hair dresser I was so excited to try this place... that quickly left.

We were greeted right away but took about 5mins til we were seated, not bad. Once we were seated i noticed the waitresses were running all over the restaurant with  no clear direction of what was happening. 

I ordered the muddy water and the full order fried chicken (3pc of 2 legs on thigh) with Mac and cheese, mashed potatoes and gravy  with collard greens. My boyfriend got the half ribs with Mac and cheese with mashed potatoes and gravy. 

The chicken was fried good but lacked flavor along with the mashed potatoes that tasted like they didn't season it at all, the Mac was pretty dry, the greens were ok and ribs were half fat half meat. 

Our waitress was a mess. Kept asking what we ordered, forgot my boyfriend's water and took forever with my card... boyfriend went to the bathroom and some before I got my card back.  I would not recommend or return here."}
{"text":"This my second time at M & M's in Las Vegas , Charleston.I have been to several in Los Angeles, California where I live. Please stay away from this place. Roaches,roaches,roaches. The manager did nothing, no good customer service, so sad I try to support but I just can't"}
{"text":"Well! This resturant could use some help in the customer service department and time your food is served! I over heard people saying they had been waiting an hour! We patiently sat and waiting on our food, which by the way took an hour! If I was the owner I would hire someone to manage this establishment and at least help comfort the customers as they are waiting! Perhaps bring out waters and drinks with cornbread cakes or something to help the time go by! There was so much chaos in the kitchen and it is my opinion that the energy of the kitchen shifted to the waitress who were clearly frustrated and over worked! There needs to be a better process of serving the customers! They are not prepared to handle large groups! They should take care of there smaller parties first!! Hells Kitchen needs to come film here and help this establishment!! Good food! Really good food but the wait time is too long! You're food will be fresh unlike buffets, so I give credit in that department! The owner should sit and watch how his business is being run!!! He would learn a lot! If your wait is long, get water and you have to try the lemonade and ice tea mixed!!! I sat and wrote this review and watched a show! Great concept! Well decorated and centrally located! They have take out! The kitchen needs to get their act together and fast! The reviews will match up once the kitchen moves faster and the waitresses help make the customers feel better!! Confusion!! Confusion!! Great food though!!"}
{"text":"I get the impression that Southern food is like pizza and BBQ.  Everyone has a strong opinion about what the best kind is, no one seems to agree, and if you didn't grow up with that certain recipe, you aren't going to like it.

Thankfully this place cooks just like my granny used to.  I've never been to Mississippi but I feel like this place has Alabama comfort food down... or at least how my grandmother used to cook Alabama comfort food.  Fried chicken, mac and cheese, collard greens, stuffing with gravy, red beans and rice... all very good!  The cornbread... now that I've had it, I don't think I can live without it. The hospitality is amazing!  

The only thing that was not like back home was the chitterlings.  Most people have to good sense not to order chitterlings (pig intestines).  But I lack such common sense.  I'm used to them breaded and fried.  But here, they are not breaded and kind of soupy.  Not bad, but not great.  

Definitely a fan.  Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I don't know what the deal is on all the previous bad ratings. I had the best experience here. Service was quick and accurate. I am amazed on the food. It's something truly special. We were planning to go to IHOP across the street, too busy. So we had to \"suffer\" with some authentic soul food instead. The biscuits here are so buttery, corned beef hash is an A+. Pancakes taste like Cinnamon Toast Crunch, for real! I mean, can't get enough so I had to order to go too! WOW! Good job, y'all! I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I just hope that they get more help for the servers so the take out orders can be done w/o being messed up like mine was messed up 2X before I walked out the door like the signs inside the restaurant say to check. I had big expectations but it was a bit of a let down."}
{"text":"The restaurant is very homey feeling. A nice place to eat. We ordered a full snapper with mac & cheese, green beans and yams and a half mixed fried chicken with rice & beans and yams. The mini cornbread pancakes are definitely a tasty treat.

The snapper was good. Crunchy cornmeal shell with piping hot insides. The yam side dishes were delicious. Overall a satisfying meal.

Service was very friendly and quick.

Prices were higher than I expected them to be."}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed this joint yet? M&M is hands down the best soul food joint I've had in the Vegas area. And I'm sure everyone else agrees too because this place is always packed full whether it's lunch or dinner time. Upon seating you'll get some fresh, warm cornbread pancakes that are mmmm so delicious and much better than actual cornbread or dinner rolls. They only bring you 1 or 2 per person but sometimes I wish I could have more!

I always get the smothered fried chicken, but the regular fried chicken is always good too if you're not a big gravy fan. The chicken is always fresh and crispy and the full dinner order comes with your choice of 3 sides for around $13.99. They also have a \"half\" order for slightly less but you just get 1 less piece of chicken and 1 less side. The sides here are ok and it really depends on what you get. The mac and cheese is probably the best side here. The cabbage is sometimes a little bland and I'm not a big collard greens or okra kind of guy so that's really my only green option. 

I just wish they opened later than 8 pm! Also be patient because when it gets packed in here, the speed of service goes down a little bit because they only have 2-3 servers at all times. This holds me back from being able to give them a perfect rating"}
{"text":"Very good food, large portions and excellent service. Every time I am in Vegas this place is a must!"}
{"text":"I had a very very bad experience tonight at this restaurant i recommend no one goes to this restaurant. First we walk in and have to sign a book and write are own name and how many in our party then we waited about 10 min which was the only good thing, we got seated and we waited 35 min before anyone came to take a drink order...there was no silerware on the table...the hotsauce container was dirty, finally someone came to our table and ask us for our food order before asking us what we wanted to drink then she was called away and she left us once came back started to take our order then she was called again and left us again then she came back and continued the order she was called a thrid time and left us again by then i got up and ask for a manager i was told the only manager was the kitchen manager. Then we were told we only can take cash because the cc machine was down. So i cancelled my order because i had no cash so the kitchen manager came out i told him my complaint he said he would take care of my food that was nice however when the rest of the food came it was terrible and the waitress got our order wrong so when my free meal came out it was horrible the chicken was not cooked right the mac and cheese was cold and the yams were way to sweet so i didnt enjoy my free meal at all also the people i was with from out of town food was terrible. There was a waitress who saw we were upset and offered us free dessert that looked terrible..then on top of that the kitchen manager came out and cussed a customer out in front of everyone. It was a very terrible experience and the owner Tim should pay better attention to his new restaurant and train his cooks and waitress how to really run a restaurant. I went on Facebook and on google to tell people that my experience at mm on the strip was terrible and i wont go there again."}
{"text":"The service was not great at all, we waited over 30 minutes for our order. The waitress never came back to check on us, it was a horrible experience and not to mention the food was horrible in fact my husband got sick after eating there. I would not recommend this place at all. We were visiting from out of town and wanted a soul food breakfast, definitely the wrong choice"}
{"text":"Had the usual CHICKEN AND WAFFLES !!! Server was great & very attentive. Thank you so much !!!"}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER!! BEEN SITTING HERE ALL OF 1 HOUR AND 4 MINUTES AND STILL NO FOOD... NO REMORSE  JUST A BUNCH OF ATTITUDE AND POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. We waited 30 mins to even take our order and came and left without taking our order then took a groups order who was seated 15 mins AFTER us!!! Will never come back to this restaurant next time I'm in vegas worst experience  ever!!! Gave one star cause I had too!!"}
{"text":"Wow and wow I was looking for a soul food spot in Las Vegas, let me tell you M & M Soul food did not disappoint in any way! From the moment I stepped in the service was wonderful. The young waitress so nice and helpful and truly made you feel like you were old childhood friends. They brought us out homemade corn pancakes along with my sweet tea it was perfection. I am eager to come back and try their breakfast..chicken and waffles YES PLEASE!"}
{"text":"If youre going to las vegas, you MUST EAT HERE!!! ive never tasted a more superb gumbo before. Absolutely amazing!! No complaints whatsoever. The staff are really nice and the kool aide is great! I love the fact that it is served in a jar. Great atmosphere!!!"}
{"text":"I was raving about this place to my coworkers all week after reading the reviews, so we finally decided to go! So excited! Met up there about 10:15a. Little did I know they ONLY served breakfast until 11a. I was hoping to get the oxtail thing, but after a long debate, I settled with wings and waffles. My coworkers had gotten there before me and had already ordered. 10 minutes later, I put my order in. Got the muddy water. Mmmm, sweet and tangy goodness.

The food ended up taking about 30-40 minutes. How horrible. There seemed to be 1 server for the whole place and 1 busser, and 1 cook. The server was impressive though, carrying 5 plates of food all on one hand. Other than that, I guess you can't expect great service.

But the important thing was the food! I actually got a side of pancakes also. And they came out first, before anyone's food. And they were yummy. There was a vanilla cinnamon flavor to them. And the waffles were probably the same batter which were delicious as well. When the wings and waffles finally did arrive, nice and hot, I was famished. The waffles were great, very soft and moist with a great flavor and the wings were cooked well and seasoned well. The hot sauce was great.

So overall, 4 stars for their food, 2 stars for service and atmosphere. Comes out to 3 stars. (Yay I can do math!)

Oh BTW, their music/speakers... funky stuff. As we were waiting for the food, we noticed that the music kept stopping. Like in a dance where they pause so you can change partners. Or maybe someone trying to practice DJ-ing. Either way, not very cool. At first it was fun to joke about, then it just got annoying."}
{"text":"Not the greatest soul food. Ribs were really fatty chicken was ok BBQ sauce was not that great corn bread was not good only thing good was Yams."}
{"text":"I got an order to go. 60 dollars worth. Although, it does say that fried foods could take up to 45 minutes, it took an hour and it wasn't exactly busy until I had already been there for 30 minutes. Could be better. Staff was nice but there seems to be only one cook for the entire place. It's a little old inside and could probably use renovation but since I won't be back, I won't even know."}
{"text":"I normally don't write reviews as I'm sitting in the place, live-tweeting it.  But this is a special case.  Wow. The service here totally sucks.

This didn't happen to us, but there was clearly a party of similar size who have been waiting longer than us to get a table.  I mean, it sucks for them that they got seated after us, and I'm not complaining, but that's not cool.

It's also a complete waste of space.  At least, like 5-10-15 feet between tables.  There's no list by which you sign up and wait for a table.  It's just a woman who walks around like every 5-10 minutes and asks how long people have been waiting, totally inefficient.

Got seated, and waiting to order?  Like 10-15 minutes.  Waitress apologized, but she probably didn't care.  It sounded like she was used to apologizing and was just doing it out of habit.

Got water and drinks? About 5 minutes after we ordered...

Let's see when the food--  ya'know what? I'm as fired of writing as I'm tired of waiting.

I'm not gonna review the food.  It's probably whatever.

I'm done.

**I know there are typos in here.  Not worth fixing.  If they go out of business, fine.  Whatever."}
{"text":"The service was great and the cornbread pancakes are the thing that would have me coming back...the shrimp and grits and the other hand were just ok. It would have been better if they were cheesy grits"}
{"text":"wow!  what a gem!  their fried chicken was exactly what i wanted: crispy outside juicy inside. my husband and i fought over the very last piece.  oxtail was very flavorful and the gravy was amazing!   my favorite side dishes: collard green and cabbage.  service was lovely.  highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Stay the hell away from the place if you want REAL soul food!..

First off be prepared to have hours to spare was waiting on this mess of a place!

Im a local here take it from me when i say dont waist ya damn time! We waited over a hour, and a half for our food. My mom and i ordered cat fish, mac, cabbage, yams.  Place was not even packed and had us in there all day. The big RED FLAG is the sign in sheet that have when you walk in! We ordering take out?  Not waiting to be seated so im trying  to understand why we have to sign in but watever. 

So she takes our order. We waiting damn near two hours not offered a complimentary drink maybe water perhaps by this time im getting parched and annoyed! My mom ask the lady hey did they forget about us she says oh no what did u order again ill go check. She comes out like oh its done waiting on cornbread. By this time im like skip the corn bread just bring me my food. So we get the food pay leave out and head to the car. 

Get to the car my sis who was the driver wanted to taste her food, so im like let me taste mines too. I open up my plate to my surprise so hard dark looking catfish? Mac and cheese wait i mean the mac cause wasnt no damn cheese on it. That shit was light skin tf!!?
Cabbage looked like so soggy leaves in autumn no damn season didnt even bother to open the yams i know them shit was canned from walmart by looking at my moms plate.! 

Went in got a refund told them fools never again!!!! 

You heard it here first!"}
{"text":"I was driving by and had to try this place upon reading so many great reviews and i am always on the search for amazing chicken & waffles. It was so yummy! There is so much flavor in the batter! The chicken was nice and crispy and so flavorful! I will definitely be returning, there is so much to try! The staff was super friendly and inviting! Worth the drive i will be back !"}
{"text":"What is in Las Vegas for vacation and eight at M and M Café soul food wave that was even greater had a great time food was delicious if you get a chance to go to Vegas go to m and m soul food"}
{"text":"I had fried chicken macaroni and yams.
AMAZINGGGGG!!!!
Great service Nd also very good sweet tea & muddy water."}
{"text":"On our trip to Las Vegas, my husband and I heard great things about this soul food restaurant. So we decided to take a chance and eat here. We were not disappointed! Our waitress Jazmin was very attentive, and very very sweet. It was a little bit loud in there, but that just goes to show how friendly and comfortable everyone was. The food was phenomenal! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Oxtails, fried chicken and corn bread dressing were amazing!! The seating list is ridiculous. Management needs to come up with a better system.  The service was great from the employees working!"}
{"text":"The great smothered fried chicken did not compensate for being treated like a second class citizen!

The entree's and sides reminded me of being at Peaches in Jackson, Mississippi.  Unfortunately, sitting beside the window with the summer sun beating through and no blinds installed at the dinning area, eating the food was uncomfortable at best.  Beyond that, the slow and rude service made my party feel as if the folks at M & M were doing us a favor by allowing us to eat at there restaurant.  I'll make better soul food at home and let M & M treat others so poorly as they clearly do not value their customers."}
{"text":"The place was crowded and everyone spoke to everyone. When The customer enters the door saying good morning as if their at home.
It was very crowded even these good looking cops came in were friendly.  Breakfast was good. The only thing is I had to tell them to clean off the table because there was still was mugs and crumbs from last guest.I noticed  they clean the table when the customer is sitting.  That's a no no"}
{"text":"Service was horrible! Waited almost 20 minutes before anyone greeted us. Everyone that worked there just kept walking by us like it wasn't their job to seat us. We didn't leave because we really wanted to like this place and support it. The food...

Mac and cheese: Subpar..cold and not seasoned
Greens: Nothing Special about them and also cold
Corn bread dressing: Decent but needed more gravy and also cold 
Catfish: The only reason for the star. It was the only good thing on the plate.

Portions are small, food is waaayyyy over priced for the small portions they give, definitely won't be going back and it's sad because I want to support black businesses as much as I can. We have to do better folks."}
{"text":"I was craving soul food and my bf did research on Yelp and came across M&M. Overall, it received mixed reviews, we had to try to it out for ourselves.
 
Amped and juiced from the Pacquiao-Hatton weighs-ins, we decided to have pre-partying celebration dinner with my brother. We started off with the sweet tea and the cornbread pancakes, which were nice, light and not super thick like regular cornbread. Then we ordered the fried catfish, fried chicken, greens, mac and cheese, and rice and gravy. The food came out hot and it was so good! I have to say that it was the best soul food I had in a long time! The staff was very nice and helpful too. 

With our bellies full were were ready to conquer the LV  nightlife!"}
{"text":"Jerria gave us the best service by far that I've had in the last two weeks. I never had to ask for a refill once. Everytime I looked up she was anticipating me or my girls next need. I always here how amazing this place is but never about the wonderful service. The food was EVERYTHING. Thank you Jerria for the making are trip a great experience. We take are meals serious lol"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting this wonderful restaurant.   My waitress was excellent, informative  and very polite.  I had the Smoothed Pork Chops, Greens, Fried Okra and Dressing.  Food so good, I didn't need salt or pepper. Wonderful seasoned and the portion was perfect. In other words, it's time for a nap.  Highly recommended and I will be returning often."}
{"text":"Husband and I finally decided to try this place (hubby ate there all the time in LA). I was super excited as my husband has been raving about food forever.  Wow was I disappointed!!!!!  I ordered smothered chicken and we had mash potatoes, green beans and Mac n cheese in the side.  Chicken was decent, however mash and green beans were so salty it was inedible!! Mac n cheese was horrendous....don't really know how to describe it besides \"globby and gritty\".  Don't think we will ever return."}
{"text":"The kool aid takes me back. Love the corn cake too!"}
{"text":"Long wait for food and drinks . But food and drinks was good when it eventually came ."}
{"text":"Heard about this place and had to visit... Excellent food, service and laid back atmosphere... My son and I will be back soon! It was just what we craved."}
{"text":"I thought I had wrote a review here when I tried it for the first time but I guess I just checked in. I was reviewing all my reviews when i noticed i missed mine for M & M. So i wanted to write mine. I have tried Roscoe's chicken and waffles in Los Angeles, Ca several times. I was very excited to find M & Ms where i could get chicken and waffles. I have to admit it was delicious! I just remember when i was eating, when i would eat the waffles i would say yummm the waffles taste the best, then i would take a bite of the chicken and say oh nooo the chicken is the best. and this just kept going back and forth the whole entire meal. I was soo stuffed by the end but i wanted to keep eating more. I would definitely come here again and recommend this place to everyone! =D really enjoyed my experience here."}
{"text":"What can you say about this place?  It's soul food, it's incredible. Today we had the fried catfish, with greens and red beans and rice. And the smothered pork chop with cabbage, and mashed potatoes. The service was perfect, the food was incredible, and it completely satisfied our craving for soul food. It's a bit of a drive from our house, but we were over on this side of town and decided to stop here for lunch. As always, we were glad that we did. Our water was never dry, and the food was delivered promptly and right on point. 

For desert, we split some banana pudding, and it was the perfect ending to a great lunch. Thanks M&M!  Never change!!"}
{"text":"Ok so I was a little skeptical cuz I only read about them on yelp.  Well it was everything I needed it to be.
Great food, great service and the prices were reasonable.
I had the chicken and waffles and it was incredible.  My step daughter had the pork chops and eggs and it was also great.
I'm picky about my fried chicken, it's got to be seasoned properly - and it was!  Can't wait to go back....."}
{"text":"This is a prime example why black businesses receive a bad reputation and aren't supported by the community. My friends and I were on vacation and decided to stop into the local soul food restaurant with high hopes. The initial wait time was 1 hour for five people which we decided to accept and stay but ended up not being seated for an entire hour. That was the first sign of mismanagement. We then sat down and waited for our server for an additional 15 minutes before she even greeted us. We all immediately knew what we wanted and ordered straight away. It took 25 minutes for our drinks to come. Another 40 minutes passed with no food or update from our server so we requested to speak to a manager, he told us that he was too busy to speak to us but eventually came over. We voiced our concerns and he proceeded to yell at the kitchen staff. Another 20 minutes passed and the chef came out to speak with us and even voiced his disappointment with our service. After all of this time passed they began to then tell me that they were out of the item I ordered. And for our 2 hours wasted and terrible service they were only willing to pay for 2 out of the 5 meals. We immediately left. To say I left disappointed and outraged is an understatement. This is by farrrrrrr the worst service and restaurant experience I've ever encountered. I wish I could give them less than one star."}
{"text":"Located next to the iconic stratosphere hotel on the end of the strip, M&M Soul food restaurant is known for great soup food at a reasonable price. Well, I regret to admit that the food here is overlooked by rude service. Some of the girls that work here need a reality check. It's customer service not just serving food. My server happened to be very good. It was the other one who really got under my skin. And, this is the second time I've dined here and witnessed the same service. You have to do better ."}
{"text":"The food was good. They don't give enough Mac and Cheese. The chicken was seasoned well. Greens were very good. Red beans and rices were good also. Corn bread cakes were tasty."}
{"text":"My friends and I tried this place after church on Sunday.  We all had heard about it and wanted to give it a try.  Although the outside wasn't very appealing as we pulled up, we decided to try it out anyway.  Once inside, we noticed that things weren't much different in regards to the decor.   It reminds me of a country style cafe with modest décor.  There were a few pictures of celebrities that had visited on the wall.  Despite the minimal décor the environment it was clean, friendly and welcoming.  The waitress, Stephanie, seated us right away.  She was pleasant, warm and engaging.  Her service and knowledge of the menu exceeded our expectations.  I thought that was great compared to some high-restaurants that I have visited where they seat you and 20 minutes later you still haven't been approached by the waiter.  The restaurant was full of people and although she was busy with other customers, she frequently checked on us.  Upon receiving our menus, I immediately noticed that the pricing was very fair. There were a lot of options and all of the soul food favorites were included.  At this point, my M&M Soul Food Café dining service had been great and I hadn't even ordered yet.  The food was even better than I anticipated!  The portions were impressive and the presentation was on point.  One of my friends ordered the shrimp and grits.  Another friend had the chicken and waffles.  My third friend tried the oxtails, greens and yams.  I ordered the smothered chicken and gravy.  Everything arrived quickly and was steaming hot. The food was very delicious!!  It made my heart feel glad and my tummy was very satisfied.  It reminded me of my good home cooking.  We all shared each other's food and laughed and talked throughout the meal.  We had a delightful experience at M&M Soul Food Café.  I'm very glad that we didn't let our first impression stop us from trying a new place.  M&M Soul Food Café has gained a new fan.  I'll certainly be back for some more of that good home cooking."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and funny gals!
The food...only reason why I dinged this place a star is because I've tried their breakfast twice n it was just ok. My date had an omelette also n it was rather tasteless n dry... 
BUT! Their lunch/dinner menu! Great! Omg I crave their oxtails all the time! So tender n yummy! The sweet potatoes and fried okra are amazing as well! And those cornbread cakes! Wow! I can just eat those alone and be happy!!!! I sure do wish they served their entire menu all day because I'm just not a fan of their breakfast. But my son does love their chicken n waffles. 
Prices are good, restaurant appearance seems pretty run down but it's clean. It'd be great if they'd relocate to a nicer location, but it's worth the drive!"}
{"text":"I feel like an absolute dumb A$$ for living in Vegas now for about 3 years and just now trying this place for the first time. I actually might go back tomorrow.

I have sampled some 25+ chicken & waffle takes from regions abound and consider myself an expert on said subject. I would stack this up against some of the best I've had including my perhaps previous favorite Maxine's Chicken & Waffles in Indianapolis. I am debating having a friend from Indy ship me in some Maxine's for a side by side comparison cause this right here folks is some of the best C&W I have had.

The service was stellar! Sweet tea was decent. Even my eggs were cooked perfectly.

I could ramble on, but you get picture. I will be a fixture at this place."}
{"text":"I had the beef short ribs with rice & gravy collard greens,  candy yams &  muddy water. The service was great. Food was excellent."}
{"text":"This location is awful and the waitress was very rude. The total lack of customer service is at a whole another level.  I will never bring anyone to this location again. Best believe I'm a local and won't return ever again. 

Our sever was rude and hopelessly forgetful. To the point it was us asking and reminding her our drinks ect...  I also had to remind her we needed our corn bread too. We ordered our food and waited over 35 min for her to return to tell us they are out of everything. We order our food prior to three tables and they got their food before ours. The best part she drops chicken wings on the floor and comes and tells me you need to find a different side and walks away. 

When we asked her to explain how it happened she starts yelling at us to the point  it was so loud that three tables can hear her. This behavior could have started drama with other people having dinner. 

I letting you know don't go there. The worst part is NO management could be found. I ask for the manager and she walked away."}
{"text":"Good soul food the price is OK it make me miss home!
Thank you very much I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I went with a large group and I don't think they're used to that kind of volume. It took a long for the orders to finally come out. Others were done while some were just receiving their orders. I had the 3 chicken wings and waffle plate. The chicken was crispy and moderately flavored, however, it was very oily/greasy. The waffles were very tasty and prepared the way their supposed to. The prices are very reasonable and the decor is adequate. This place will not blow you away but if your in the mood for soul food at a decent price, then give it a try."}
{"text":"I came here with my family as we were leaving Vegas, being fans of soul food we thought we'd check it out. The workers were really nice and make you feel like you are at home, the food however is eh. 
Here is my verdict on the things we ordered.

Hush puppies-pretty good 
Red beans and rice-was okay 
Shrimp and grits-bland, I had to add a ton of salt, pepper, and hot sauce just to eat it
Fried chicken-really good but you can't go wrong with fried chicken, am I right?
Mac and cheese-bland
Biscuits-were awesome like all biscuits are, nice and buttery 

To conclude this place isn't that bad but with all the places to eat in Vegas I think you can get better food elsewhere, maybe the location on the strip is a little better."}
{"text":"Boy oh boy!!!! Food was excellent!!! Had the full order of pork chops and couldn't stop eating!! Can't wait to come back on my next trip to the strip!!"}
{"text":"Came for breakfast while on vacation in Vegas. This place is a tucked away gem. The location is off of the beaten path but is definitely a great find. This restaurant is off of the strip and seems subtle and quiet, but the taste are powerful!

The biscuits seemed to melt in your mouth. I had bacon, eggs and home fries for breakfast along with succulent biscuits. The bacon was crisp, the eggs were perfectly cooked and the home fries were flavorful. My companion had chicken and waffles. I must admit, I don't normally like the combination of chicken and waffles, but the chicken and waffles came with chicken wings and buttery waffles. The chicken was perfectly seasoned and very crisp. The combination  of sweet and salty were divine. This is definitely a place that I will return to when I return to Vegas. What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, except for when it comes to great food !"}
{"text":"Walked in signed in for 2,  waited for 15 minutes was told to have a seat. Was sat down waited another 15 min with no service for drinks. Got up and left along with another patron who also was waiting, he left! Terrible service on a first impression..."}
{"text":"My wife and I loved this place.  It's old and worn, but that adds to the charm.  Very friendly service...never ending awesome corn pancakes at no charge...they don't need butter!

Get the fried chicken...it's as good as we had ever had.  Super crispy, juicy, and great spices.  Also really enjoyed the side items, including fried okra, blackeyed peas, and red beans and rice.

The Entertainment book also has a BOGO coupon, so you can take a friend and it's half the price.  

We plan to go back to M and M Soul Food each and every time we visit Vegas."}
{"text":"Havent had a good soul food meal since living with my mom and I must say I love it! Shoutout to our waitress Angie she hooked us up. I ate here twice and eachtime i was happy with the results."}
{"text":"Got the oxtail. It was great. Really tender and flavorful. They have a great atmosphere and play hoppin music."}
{"text":"Loving this gem not in the normal part of the strip! Greens were amazing!! Shrimp and Grits!! Fried Chicken was on point! And not these baby whings and legs either! Parking is tough so a ride share is best! Deffo going to come back out this way again. Server wasn't the most attentive, very nice, but the food kept me occupied!!"}
{"text":"I ordered biscuits amd gravy. I've never had biscuits and gravy in brown sauce. The onions and bell peppers was just thrown on top uncooked. For this to be a soul food place I was expecting so much more. Never will I ever eat here again. Someone in out party had dressing, someone else had cabbage, mac and cheese and none of it got ate.

Dis-appointing and disgusted."}
{"text":"Great soul food restaurant. Their jams and fried fish were delicious. Great service as well. If you go order the muddy water! Made perfect Very professional and fast. It is a small hole in the wall location but cute and the prices are reasonable !"}
{"text":"I have to write a review about this place cause it was just that damn good!! Go to spot for soul food in LAS VEGAS!!! Tho my Oder was incorrect when I got to my hotel room but I quickly called and told them. They were very polite and when I got there my correct order was just fresh off the fire!! Oh btw I got the smothered chicken!  hands down so good! The waitress I had was beautiful and so very inviting. I'm definitely going back to m&m when I get back in town! 10 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Great food but bad service , got put on hold twice n they never came back to the phone and then the next phone call I get hung up on . Please get it together y'all!"}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast and I seriously cannot wait to go back for lunch. If this cafe hadn't been almost full, I totally would have licked the plate. 

I was with a group of 3, all first timers, and we agreed that we would  be coming back soon. I ordered the fried chicken wings and waffles, of course, as I am a huge fan of this dish and order it whenever it's on the menu. The ONLY time I eat fried chicken is when It's accompanied with a buttered waffle and smothered in maple syrup. If I'm gonna go, I wanna go all the way. Wings are not my preferred piece of  the chicken but that is a small thing and I'm willing to overlook it because the waffles were awesome. Perfectly soft, chewy texture and I'm pretty sure I detected a hint of cinnamon. They were a perfect compliment to the fried chicken. I might be spoiled for this dish at any other restaurant. 

The catfish plate with two eggs, grits and toast was really tasty too. The eggs were perfectly cooked and the grits didn't require any doctoring up. They were good without any added butter or sugar. The third breakfast entree was corn beef hash. I didn't try it, not really my thing.  I'm guessing it was good though because there wasn't one bite left on the plate. 

This building is in a state of slight disrepair. It looks a little rundown but don't let that keep you away. It's just part of the charm. The two waitresses that served my table were great. Fast and efficient service with a friendly smile. Everyone was busy and doing their part to make this place run smoothly. It was about 9:30 in the morning on a week day and while this place wasn't packed, it was still busy and they kept everything going like a well oiled machine."}
{"text":"We visited M&M last time we were in Vegas and it was fabulous. My mom used to cook soul food and so it was very nostalgic for me. The fried chicken was absolutely delicious. It will be a regular stop whenever we visit Lost Wages from now on."}
{"text":"Cliffs: Good soul food - gives you the itis


----

This palace is the shit, I went here on a recent visit to vegas. I love checking out places like this. The food was excellent, short ribs good, fried chicken good, pork chop good. Chicken and waffles combo good.

All I can say is they have good soulfood and I got the 'itis."}
{"text":"The three stars are mostly for the service which was very good. Three of us went to this place for an early dinner, I ordered the shrimp and grits. I would say definitely do not order this dish. Not much flavor and some kind of grease all over the top of it. Which I did not appreciate. I love shrimp and grits but I would never order it here again. Other person in my party had smothered fried chicken. They let me taste some of it it was just OK, nothing fantastic. DM's that came with it were overly sugared. With plain white sugar and out with brown sugar. This is a matter of taste however I prefer my yams with just butter and no sugar at all. The green beans were also rather on the tasteless side. Again, I love green beans, but these were just not very good. 
Third person in our party got the barbecue short ribs. He tore them up I didn't even get to taste them he really enjoyed them so I guess they were really good!
Oh, I almost forgot the most important thing to me. I ordered red beans and rice to take home with a hotlink sausage. The next day when I ate it, the hotlink sausage was really good but the red beans and rice were not. Sadly, you can get much better red beans and rice at Popeyes. And the next time I get that dish that's where I will get it. I've had this dish all over the place and I make it myself. It's not that hard to get it right."}
{"text":"The service is excellent! The corn bread is great and the dressing is very tasty. However, do not order peach cobbler to go or you'll get overly sweet peaches, no taste of nutmeg or cinnamon, and tiny piece of the burnt crust"}
{"text":"Best chicken wings and waffles ever! The corned beef hash was fresh and cooked to order. I absolutely love the muddy water!"}
{"text":"Was in town a week for a seminar, and wanted to try a soul food spot. I was told about this particular place by a friend, who doesn't live in Vegas, who have it rave reviews. It was pretty packed when I got there, but we were seated fairly quickly. We waited 45 min AFTER being seated, before the waitress even came over to ask us what we wanted to drink. When we finally got our food, it was nothing to write home about, as the food was just OK! Trust me on this one.... If you're ever in Vegas and want some good soul food, hit up Gritz Cafe instead (one of the Uber drivers told me about it), you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Nothing like sitting at a table for 15 min while the staff is talking at the register and ignoring you.  

This used to be my favorite soul food place in town.   The food is good.   Good enough that we drove clear across town for crappy service.  

Ended up paying for our drinks and leaving.  Sucks that they couldn't even try to make it right."}
{"text":"The BEST soul food I have had (outside of Detroit) in my entire life! The okra and smothered chicken are out of control good. The service is great, and despite being packed the staff and servers were all very nice and attentive. Be prepared if you go on certain days (Sundays and anytime around New Years) that you are going to have a long wait to get a table in this small restaurant. I have gone back several times since and have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"When you've been eating a bunch of Mexican, pizza, pasta, and burgers. A soul food spot seems like heaven. Although the food needs to be seasoned more if you want to call it southern. (I'm from southeast Texas/Louisiana) it's decent food. I had Mac and cheese, greens, red beans and rice, and green beans. All had no taste but the greens. The Oxtails were not meaty AT ALL. The pork chops were good though. But considering I don't have much time to cook in Vegas and I miss soul food I won't stop coming here. I'll just have my own seasoning on deck"}
{"text":"WHO: To anyone and everyone who hasn't had a little soul food in their lives, be my guest! & to those who have had soul food, go ahead and have some more!

WHY: If you're hungry, YOU'RE HUNGRY!

WHEN: The cafe is open Monday-Sunday from 7am-8pm.

WHERE: Located on Charleston & Valley View.

WHAT: I have been waiting all month for this day to come! My girlfriends and I have been planning a lunch date to the cafe and we finally pulled through!

First and foremost... hands down the best customer service ever! All of the servers were phenomenal, kept coming back to give us water, asking if we were okay, and the owner (or who I believe was the owner) came to our table to greet us and asked if everything was fine. 

As I was looking through the menu, I was overwhelmed with excitement and full of joy! I ordered the full fried chicken (white meat) and it came with three sides. I chose macaroni & cheese, potato salad, and collared greens. I personally loved the collared greens, but the sides were okay. The chicken, on the other hand was cripy, well-seasoned, and delicious!! OH YEAH! HOW COULD I FORGET! Prior to bringing your meal out, they give you corn bread pancakes, which I absolutely love! The perfect flavor & goodness, I wanted more!

I was so happy about everything, I ordered pork chops to go for my brother (which I also snagged a piece). That was really good too!!

BIG UPS TO M&M SOUL FOOD, AS I WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK!"}
{"text":"Came in from Denver for my 40th birthday. My dad lives here in Vegas and has told me about this place. Was great food, and very pleasant customer service. Our server was great. Will definitely come back, espically for the cornbread!!!"}
{"text":"Oxtail absolutely amazing. Very clean, everyone friendly. My husband got cat fish plate he loved it as well. Our waitress Atifa was very nice and made sure we had everything we needed a must go to spot. If you're looking to be around good folk, great atmosphere and leave full M&M is place too be."}
{"text":"Soul food at it's finest. I am so happy M&M decided to open a second location. I am even happier that it is right by my job. Now, I can get this southern style comfort food quite often if I choose to. I don't know how healthy it will be for me, but I will enjoy it!

I am a big fan of the catfish, and the fried chicken. The meatloaf didn't impress me, but the gravy on top was great. 
The greens, the mac & cheese, and the rice and gravy are personal favorite sides. And if you like mustard, try the potato salad as it has a mustard-y flavor that is undeniable. 

This location is pretty big. You could pull off a birthday dinner or special event easy. The service is great, very friendly and hospitable. They make me feel welcome every time. 

Don't let the surrounding area throw you off. It is not the best neighborhood, but there are way worse areas in Vegas. 
I am glad to see a local mom & pop shop expand. Especially to Las Vegas Blvd where they will hopefully get that tourist traffic. Thanks M&M, next stop, Henderson!"}
{"text":"Good food most of the time. Terrible service most of the time (unless you get Tashara). 

As a Black southerner I love the food. But sometimes the service is so bad that it makes me consider never going again and it's a 5 min walk from my condo. 

My favorite menu item is the pork chops. They're ALWAYS good.  The fried chicken is great too. 

My least favorite menu item is the shrimp and grits which tastes good but has terrible presentation. It just looks like soup on top of grits. In fairness to the restaurant I had it when they first added it to the menu but I haven't had it since because it just looked so gross. 

The other thing that I don't like is the noise level. The building has awful acoustics so no matter what's going on it sounds super loud. Even when there's no music. 

Overall I still rate it as a 4 because the food is almost always good and no matter how badly some of the servers treat me I just can't seem to quit them!"}
{"text":"Great selection of Southern style Cuisine. The service is excellent and attentive. The Oxtail was seasoned to perfection and fall of the bone. A must try if you craving some southern comfort food"}
{"text":"Walked in M&M's on a Sunday night only to not be greeted by a hostess waitresses were just walking by but never acknowledged my presence. Finally got seated after 10 mins of standing by the door. Gets seated and immediately I hear the other tables complaining about there food not being served and others that came in later than them being served before them. Ordered my food and so did the person I was with to only find out they were out of things on the menu. Get my food and boy was I disappointed the full size order of fish came with 2 slices of fish and 3 sides the fish was pretty good but the sides were terrible the red beans and rice looked old, the macaroni and cheese was terrible, and the greens taste like they had sugar in them. Then the table next to mine the woman had hair in her food. The cook comes out with dreads that weren't even in a net. I was disgusted I didn't finish my meal and the food was garbage. 

Ps. The corn bread came in the shape of a pancake."}
{"text":"good food. cooked to order fried foods.  great flavor.  will def go back when im back in las vegas!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was pretty good. We had nearly everything on the menu. The smothered pork chops were delicious. The gravy was the right consistency and the chop was crispy and well seasoned. The oxtails were tender. The chicken was crispy and seasoned. The waffles and pancakes were sweet and cinnamony. You really can't go wrong with the kool-aid. Our waitress, Toni was really good and made our experience even better. I'd recommend it if you want good soul food.,"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service, excellent experience.  My father and I come here for breakfast or lunch at least once a month.  Serving sizes are perfect and the lemonade is some of the best I've had.  I suggest the ham steak breakfast with the homemade corn bread."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing, the wait times can be a little heavy once your seated but the food makes it all worth it. 

This was my first visit to M&M's Soul Food so I played it safe. I ordered the catfish with Mac and cheese, collard greens and rice with gravy. 

This would have been a five star review but the long long wait time wouldn't allow me. 

Stop in and visit if your on the strip!"}
{"text":"Ok I haven't had decent soul food since big mama's chicken closed down on rancho and bonanza, and that shit was gooood!! So Ellen F. and I get the itch for some fried chicken and what not, we just did farm basket not to long ago so we are in search for the next semi best thing. Low and behold M&M soul food, another joint many of you probably passed numerous times in your travels. It's in the plaza on the southwest corner of Charleston & Valley View. 

You walk in and it's a diner like atmosphere with the counter and all. There's seats straight back if you don't want to hear the blaring music with the TV in front. We opted to sit by the speaker to get the full experience as it is soul food and a lil Earth Wind & Fire never hurt anyone. I ordered the smothered chicken with 3 sides (Mac and cheese, rice & beans, collard greens). The badass thing about this place is they let you order half orders of stuff if your not feeling like stuffing yourself, half orders come with two sides. 

While you wait for you food they bring this corn bread in the shape of a small pancake, at first I put it aside but after staring at it for a few minutes I tried it. The corn bread was very good and when you finish the waitress is nice enough to bring you more (at no charge). My chicken was very good although a lil on the dry side but the gravy helped with that, the Mac and cheese tastes home made. I really liked the rice and beans as they are kidney beans which I am a big fan of. Collard greens were just ok, lil strong for my pallet on the green side, had a lil bite. 

I felt completely safe and comfortable as the 6'5\" security guard (probably not that tall, i'm short) with a gat strapped at his side paced up and down the place several times. Waitress was very friendly and service was prompt. Four of us ate for under $65 and was stuffed when I left. Music was old school 80's pop and when there's a game on they tune in. If you ever get that fried chicken itch or soul food in general give this place a try as there aren't to many in the 702."}
{"text":"The 2 of us were craving a soulfood breakfast. We walked in was greeted and our orders taken. After 25 mins waiting on our order we started to smell uncooked chitterlins. Made us nausea because chitterlins stink really bad, and we don't eat pork. Finally we got our meals and I must admit the meal was good BUT the service needs improvement and the morning waitresses need to work on their getto acting attitudes because it's offensive to customers like me. Despite the lousy waitress with the snotty attitude I still tipped her because she smiled after I express my unhappiness."}
{"text":"I visited Las Vegas this weekend and was told that M & M was the best, which is partially true. I had the fried chicken on Saturday which was okay...I've had better at Popeyes and my boyfriend agreed since I ended up giving him the rest of it. I tasted his fried catfish which was some of the best I've ever had. So good, in fact, that we went back again on Monday. This time the fish was just as tasty, but the service was horrible. We never received a menu and when the waitress came to take our order 20 minutes later she had an attitude. She walked up to the table and said, \"what y'all want.\" She didn't offer a smile, say sorry for the wait or offer us a menu! Overall the catfish, red beans and rice and mac n cheese was delicious, but I will not be returning because of the service received."}
{"text":"The food here is just so hit yes I stopped coming. The last time I ordered biscuits and gravy it was served with a brown gravy. Perhaps I'm wrong but everything pretty much taste like it's out of a can. Other times I've been here and the food was really good but it's very much not consistent."}
{"text":"In my 30 years of living, I have never had such  an abhorrent experience as I did today at this restaurant. I'd like to start by saying that I'd heard so many wonderful reviews on M & M Soul Food Cafe and my expectations were quite high. I got to the restaurant with my family, 5 other individuals, at 3:30 PM and stood waiting to be greeting by a host. After several minutes of waiting, the host, who also happens to be the manager, came to greet us. She informed us that there was a wait of 25 minutes. After waiting for about 45 minutes, we approached the manager and asked for an update on the table. She informed us that we could not be seated because there was a shortage of fried chicken and there was another table who had not been served their food yet. Fast forward 1 hour. We are irritated that we still don't have food. The manager came over and started to have a friendly conversation in which we informed her that serval parties have left because of the long wait and bad service. Verbatim, she replied \"we don't care! Our food is good and we only want to serve customers who understand that it's going be a long wait\" 

Fast forward another 25 mins.. still no food! The server came over and told us our food was \"up next\". My cousin asked what \"up next\" meant and then all hell broke loose. The server replied that she didn't know what it meant but that she saw our ticket up next at the counter. My cousin asked if the server could go and ask the manager how long \"up next\" was. The server replied \"no I already asked my manager 3 times and she just told me to get the hell out of her face\" Wow. My cousin said, you do realize we have been waiting for 2 hours and the server replied \"what do you want me to do about it\" 

Fast forward 10 minutes, our food finally came! BUT our orders were wrong, the food was cold, and the vibe and experience was ruined."}
{"text":"This is a small place. If you weren't looking for it you'd pass it for sure. I ordered this to eat for lunch at work one day. I called ahead and they told me how long it would take. I got there a little before the time they gave and the employees were kind of picking fun at my accent. The food was cold and the only real item that had any flavor was the chicken and it was smothered in barbecue sauce"}
{"text":"Nice time out. Great people so friendly. Frist time for this Floridian. Food is 5 star. Out of this world!"}
{"text":"The food at M&M Soul Food is outstanding. Red Kool-Aid started my meal off on the right foot and the cornbread, chicken, greens and mac & cheese were perfection. The staff was very friendly and the owner even came outside to chat with us as we were leaving. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food was ok but there was some false advertisement involved, we where given a coupon which was not listed on the website at all that had the business name on it. False advertisement !
In return the manager was very rude and had a Mexican cooking soul food .tru story..!"}
{"text":"Been eating out for weeks on vacation, and really ready for food that tastes like grandmas house as opposed to the chef specialty. I totally got that at M&M's. I had the smothered chicken with greens, and Mac n cheese. Fiancé had oxtails, cabbage, Mac n cheese, black eyed peas. We also ordered the fried green tomatoes. Everything was fantastic except the Mac n cheese. It wasn't that fresh and not creamy at all, but it was greasy. Pretty sure it had been sitting under a heat lamp for awhile (see video). However, I was able to look past the ashy Mac n cheese because of how friendly the service was and how excellent the rest of the food tasted. The fried green tomatoes came with only 3 slices, but it was literally as good as they are in New Orleans. Not kidding, you HAVE to order them."}
{"text":"I give them a 2 food is ok but They dead wrong for charging 22 dollars for chitterlings dinner and give u a very small portion of chitterlings and very small portion on the sides... I will never go back there...at lease Ellaems give u your money worth..."}
{"text":"Not impressed! The service was awful! We waited an hour for our food and then when it finally came we had to send it back because everyone's eggs were prepared wrong. The biscuits arrived after we'd already finished everything else. The food was okay, but nothing special! I will not be returning again!"}
{"text":"So my husband and I went here because it was black owned and black staffed!! 

So, the shrimp and grits HORRIBLE. They give four shrimps (regular sized) and the grits were not seasoned, not creamy, and simply NOT good!!! The dressing is really stuffing, out of a box. The chicken breast was not flavored. The peach gobbler, canned peaches (which is not bad BUT it didn't have flavor e.i nutmeg, cinnamon, etc... and the crust was brunt!! 

The waffle was good!!! But it is s long waffle not a Belgian style waffle. The sides rice and beans and cabbage were decent. 

Price is reasonable and staff was friendly... though they forgot to put our waffle in the bag! Not a southern soul food joint and we're from Mississippi!!!"}
{"text":"I am so very disappointed with the service that this restaurant gave us! We were there for 3 hours. We asked the waiters and waitresses what was going on after about an hour and they would say they're checking on the food but none of them came back to tell us anything, they kept avoiding us. It's not cool to waste people's time this way, at least tell us what's going on, we really tried to show support but...come on. People were walking out back to back. We only stayed bc we were from out of town and didn't want to waste anymore time riding around trying to find somewhere else to go. Besides that, we figured as long as we waited the food just had to taste amazing...WRONG! 2 people ordered the chicken...it was COLD. One person ordered ox tails, another ordered short ribs ( he got 2 small ribs and they wanted him to pay $30), I ordered fried snapper and it was over cooked. All the sides were cold. How in the world is the food cold?? I asked the waiter for the manager, she came over looked at all the food we had just gotten served. We informed her why we weren't eating it, she says let me take care of this. Next thing we know, the COOK comes out and says \"what's cold!! \" (I really have to laugh bc this seems so unreal.) No customer service whatsoever, no hi how are you guys or anything, just \"what's cold.\" First off, what manager takes the COOK out of the kitchen with a full restaurant and people complaining...trust me we were not the only ones upset. Anyways he said he would \"hook us up\" with more food...really! I asked for the manager again but she was literally HIDING in the back...she sent the waiter out with our ticket that she had taken 25% off of. I was not going to pay for this but she would not come from the back to speak to me. 25% off a ticket and the food wasn't even eaten. If we thought we weren't gonna go to jail for not paying, we sure wouldn't have!"}
{"text":"Worst soul food I have ever ate. Ordered the BBQ chicken dinner and the food came out cold with 2 small pieces of chicken and the wrong sides. This is by far the worst soul food place I have ever ate at. Avoid this place. There service is not really good and worst of all their BBQ chicken was 2 small wings."}
{"text":"I feel sort of bad about this, but we only ended up tipping our waitress $1 here. I honestly think she deserved a lot less, like one cent. We did tip our bus boy $10 though and let me tell you why.

I had truly high hopes for this so-called 'classic' Vegas restaurant, but I was just disappointed. 

We were quickly assisted in finding seats as soon as we walked in. We had to move to another table because the table we were given was very wobbly. It was weird that they kind of expected us to deal with that, instead of finding a solution and just leaving the table that way. I told them I was clumsy and that I needed a different table.

Our bus boy was great and refilled our drinks several times. It was kind of cute that they were in mason jars. Our waitress, however, was unacceptable. While she was taking our order, she left in the middle of my man talking to speak to another customer just walking in. She came back 30 seconds later and didn't even apologize for interrupting him. The worst part was that she got our order wrong. We were going to get it corrected, but ended up deciding not to. They would probably going to mess that up too and we didn't want to deal with her any longer.

I did, however, ask for the smothered gravy sauce that she failed to bring us for our smothered gravy chicken. She came to our table irritated and said \"sorry\", in a very unapologetic matter, as if it was our fault she forgot to bring it. She didn't check on us the entire meal, unlike the other waiting staff there. The only time she was polite, was when she brought us our check, which we had to have another employee get for us since she was not around.

As far as the food, the fried chicken was better than okay (not better than Roscoe's in Cali), but the sides were absolutely horrid. The mac & cheese had no flavor and the collard greens tasted as if they had no spices added to them. I think I could make better at home and I'm not even a Southern cook. The mashed potatoes were edible, but that's about it. I didn't like the corn cakes, but that was my first time having them.

I have had way better Southern food here in Las Vegas. It is my opinion that you could get your filling for Southern food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Food was decent and waitress was nice but the wait time was insane...by the time I got my food I wanted out of there...may try it again as sometimes we all have bad days..."}
{"text":"Came here to get some good soul food and oxtails . I came with a group of four and we were there for over 1.5 hours. We watched two groups of two get served in front of us while we still patiently waited . The waiter lied to us and told us are food was ready and ready to come out , 30 minutes later we were still sitting there . We ended up just leaving . Wish I could've had some food to give them an accurate rating for the food . Customer service goes a long way and they lacked it . They never checked on us , just kept looking at us . We watched the kitchen continuously  bring out food and to go boxes . It was the most frustrating experience ever . Don't go here ."}
{"text":"The food was good and the people are nice. Cute little restaurant and they played good music. Being from LA it's hard to find good places that feel like home out here."}
{"text":"Really really wanted to love this place! It smelled wonderful! The menu items looked delicious... Grits, gumbo, wings... but we sat there waiting for service on the sticky floor in the half empty restaurant looking at the flustered waitress running around the kitchen and had to leave because we couldn't wait any longer. Very unorganized. No hostess to be seen. We were to write our names down on a list with a blue marker ourselves. Very confusing experience."}
{"text":"The service was outstanding, catfish was perfect, portions were ideal. Delicious, salty and satisfying Saturday brunch. Plus, the coffee kept coming."}
{"text":"Came here on a visit from Cali for a graduation. I am a huge foodie and I have been all over for GREAT food. My brother once lived in Vegas and ranted about this place. I ordered the following:

1) Gumbo - very watery and the only flavor I tasted was similar to white pepper. There was no gumbo file flavor and the gumbo was red in color. There were lots of pieces of crab, however, the crab did not taste fresh and it had a garlic flavor. I've had gumbo from white owned eateries that tasted far better. The gumbo is a no go for me.

2) Oxtails (ala carte) - The oxtails were very fatty and came covered in some type of thick orange-reddish gravy that was over seasoned. I just was not feeling the gravy or the flavor.

3) Short ribs - same as the oxtails.

4) Cornbread patties - the first bunch came out to our table cold and thick. When I informed the waitress, she brought a fresh set of patties and they were pretty good.

5) Our server was very nice but totally ghost. She rarely came back to our table and was actually sweeping the floors in the front of the place and waiting on every other table but mine.

6) Lemonade - I asked if the lemonade was fresh and home made. The server informed me that it was freshly made but failed to inform me that it was freshly made Kool-Aid Lemonade. Not \"KooL\" at all.....  

The place is very clean (the waitress made certain of this by choosing a broom over service) and it is located in a desolate tiny plaza in a somewhat industrial area with heavy traffic. There is a lack of ambiance.

To be fair, there is a lack of great food, and other than the strip, a lack of ambiance in Vegas. Therefore, the food here is in alignment with other eateries but I think I'm good on my never again visit to Vegas."}
{"text":"Best thing was fried chicken, short ribs, & corn bread. The rice was a bit undercooked & kind of hard. Greens were not seasoned enough and the macaroni tasted kind of mushy. Not a fan of the lemonade it was not sweet at all & tasted kind of watered down."}
{"text":"(9/21)..Ok why did we leave still hungry? Let me tell you the food was below average. I mean come on Chef how can you undercook Thin pieces of fried catfish.. it was so slimy underneath a nicely coated crunchy batter (i give them that much).. we were told by the waitress the oxtails were fall off the bone tender uhh yea one of the pieces were but the rest were tough..hard to chew tough... the mac & cheese , fried okra and fried chicken were the only things that hit average and trust me the hot sauce helped. The yams were likely from a can with extra sugar added to mask this I mean hello diabetes in a bowl some of that sugar should have been in the sweet tea... 4 of us thought it was not sweetened... the mashed potatoes & potato salad ughh what! Sorry i lost words.. for the benefit Maybe there was a sub chef that day or maybe he was under the weather but please get it together, Vegas needs a good soul food spot. Check the utensils we had to ask for plastic dishes were dirty ughhh.. I informed them that I should not be charged for the raw catfish (this is not a sushi spot)so they charged me  for the 3 sides and my drink which basically knock the bill down maybe 5 bucks sorry but not sorry m&m."}
{"text":"Okay the service is bad but..... If you want as close to home soul food cooking as possible this is IT! I ignored the service and went back again. They have the best chitterlings, fried chicken, cat fish and pork chops. The potato salad is HORRIBLE do not get it!!!!!!! Every one in our party and near us sent it back. There were 8 of us and we tried everything. Remember it's in the 'hood' and the service is 'hood' service, slow and with an attitude. But I'm going back to Las Vegas and M&m's Soul Food in September!!!"}
{"text":"My partner and i had breakfast one of our days in vegas. The customer service was amazing. The manager and his staff were the nicest I've ever had at an M&M's. I felt like i was at my families house  enjoying some good homecooked food!  #ThoseCornbreadCakesAreAMAZING"}
{"text":"I didn't mind the wait at all. I really enjoyed the red beans n rice, the smother chicken was good. TBH the gravy and greens were a little bland but overall I liked the food quality. The sauce for the hot wings was great. I will be back when in the city"}
{"text":"I love soul food so I thought I'd give this place a try. They always have advertisements on the radio for M&M. Been here twice now, & got their chicken & waffles. I think it's just alright. Their muddy water's really good. You get it from a jar, so it goes well with the theme. The place is over-priced for simple food, therefore I'm not sure if I'll be back. The portions don't match up with it. In addition, it's just not the cleanest place. However, if anyone finds a menu item that's worth the drop-by, I'd like the heads up."}
{"text":"This place is located at the end of the strip and in a somewhat shoddy neighborhood (well, compared to the rest of the strip), but I decided to try it out since it was a 5 minute walk from my hotel. 

Service: Very friendly.  The people were great and welcoming.
Decor: Kind of like a very big diner.  I sat at the bar and saw all the magic happen.
Food: I don't have deep south food often (as it isn't the healthiest), but they had some great selections such as oxtail, chicken, chiclets, etc and serve it in 1/2 sized entrees (2 sides) or full size (3 sides).  I got the 1/2 oxtail and it was delicious.  I have to admit there was quite a bit of fat on it, but it also had quite a bit of meat on it. In addition, they give you free cornbread which is great to dip in any of the gravy.

Overall, try this place out for some deep south cooking if you are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Moving to Vegas from cali is hard (Soul food Wise) 
We Decided to try M & M Soul Food Cafe 
We Ordered the
 Catfish Dinner - Catfish Was Great.. I would come back for that alone 
And the Chicken Dinner Very Small Portion and wasn't the best chicken but eatable  

Mac&Cheese Side- beyond cold and seemed to be day old Extremely Disappointed 
didn't waste our time at all with that crap (NOT EATEN)
Red Beans and Rice- lacked seasoning (Picked At)
Potato Salad - had that pickle taste to it (not-eaten) 
Green Beans-  very cold but the best side they had (eaten)
Yams- yams seemed to be from a can sadly (eaten)
Koo-Aid- kool-aid was Great 
CornBread Cakes -  CBC Greasy but great as well 
Sweet Potato Pie - Burnt  but the areas that wasn't burnt was good 
The Best Part About this Place that day was the Staff by far 
and i was offered new Mac & Cheese yet  we just didnt want  it 
i would say 50% of the food wasn't eaten but still not the worst experience in the  world i just think they need some better cooks more then anything 

i think for anyone who's not use to GOOD Soul Food Eating
they would find this place to be a great Soul Food Place because i have yet to find a Good Or Great Soul Food Place in Vegas"}
{"text":"Very friendly, everyone spoke when you walked in. It's a smaller establishment but very tasteful. They have two tv's for your viewing. The menu isn't large but I order the classic chicken and waffles. The BEST chicken and waffles I've ever had. Food came exceptionally fast, was fresh and steaming hot!! I'd have taking a picture but it was so delicious that I devoured it within minutes. I also had their koolaid! Delicious and free refills:) Truely enjoyed the friendly atmosphere and exceptional service!!"}
{"text":"I been wanting to go tho this place for years since I moved to Vegas but I never had time.  Today finally I got the opportunity and it was amazing.  Food was great and the service was outstanding.  We had an order of the fried chicken and and order of the meat loaf.  The Fried chicken was incredible, I will definitely go back and enjoy their food.  The atmosphere of the place was great, good music and good people.  Thank you to all the servers that waited on us, you truly made this a great experience."}
{"text":"For my family and i first time, our experience was great here. Loved the food and especially the catfish & snapper. I especially loved the corn bread dressing and I'm usually not a fan of okra but it was really good as well. Plus friendly staff and great vibes all around. Definitely will come back again"}
{"text":"I'm here on business from Mississippi and I was glad to find a place that made me feel like right at home. The food was great I recommend eating here if you're looking for for that southern soulfood atmosphere along with great taste I'm actually from Mississippi not far from the original owners home and they definitely got it"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite breakfast spot. Delicious and very reasonably price, with excellent know your name service thanks to great people like V & Stephanie."}
{"text":"So, in Vegas for the weekend and decided to go downtown to Freemont we walked so far to get to the Monorail and we saw this place. I never heard of it but Hubby said he did and it was great! So detour from the Monorail into this sweet place. Looked in and saw lots of beautiful brown faces which confirmed this place might have some Soul for real! Well, it was good every thing is made to order. I thought my mac n cheese was on the bland side. I had great side of okra and the BBQ chicken which was juicy, hot and fresh. The hudband devoured his mash potatoes with gravy, corn and smothered chicken. The sweet tea had an off set taste, but i think it was because they use A LOT of cane sugar, so got Kool-aid (yes its on the menu) it was sweet too but the sweet we love!"}
{"text":"I can't begin to explain how delicious the food is at M&M's Soul Food Cafe. My girlfriend's and I decided to make this our Sunday Dinner destination on our vacation. 
Location: Nice ducked off location on the corner. Our Lyft driver told us it was a very popular place, as he picks up a great deal of customer's from here. The restaurant isn't a fancy joint, but it's clean and cozy. *BEWARE... I've seen better public restrooms though.. IJS.
Customer Service: We followed previous Yelper's advice by going when we thought they wouldn't be busy. IT WORKED;-) We were seated immediately by the hostess. Then our waitress Lasanna(AMAZING) made us aware that she lost her voice. Which is why she'd be talking strangely, we completely understood. She answered all our questions about the menu truthfully which we appreciated. 
Food: We ordered to much .. lol But here's the  breakdown.
3pc chicken wing and waffles w/fried okra, cornbread dressing, and black eyed peas.
2 orders of the Smothered pork chops(full) w/mashed potatoes, collard greens, yams and red beans and rice.
1 Smothered fried chicken (full) w/fried okra, black eyed peas, and greens. 
1 order of banana pudding (100% YUM)
3 cups of Kool-Aid and 1 muddy water. 
EVERYTHING WAS MOUTH WATERING especially the red beans and rice, black eyed peas and waffles. Which contained cinnamon something I've never had, but I can now say I like it. Our bill came to $79.86 which I thought was amazing for all we ate. 
Lasanna ended up receiving a $20-25 tip from us as we were VERY FULL and pleased with our experience dining there. M&M's will be on my list of places to return to in future visits."}
{"text":"Amazing food & fantastic service. There was a bit of a wait so don't come hangry but if you do, you will be more than rewarded.

Chicken fried steak comes with gravy covered biscuits atop home fries. Best I've ever had.

Waffles are crispy outside and moist inside, with a touch cinnamon- perfect."}
{"text":"This place is so friendly, there was dancing good music and amazing food! Their menu just takes me to a whole new world. Even more amazing when you pair it with a blunt haha"}
{"text":"This, apparently; is a super famous restaurant. The food was okay and the service was average. Since I am from the south, I am super critical of any food bearing \"soul\" to its' name and this place offered the classics but it didn't blow me away. The tastiest part of my meal was the kool-aid...yes, I mean that! It was so cold, sugary and fruitly refreshing. [I know 'fruitly' is not a word but I just made it up] I felt like my dish was missing real flavor and kick. I wasn't impressed at all. I remember my fish tasting like a bad hookup after the club...no more one-night stands for me. Tbh, the whole experience left me without any impression. I guesss its better than fast food and the over priced show meals from the strip. I'll take the kool-aid and keep it moving."}
{"text":"Party of four .
Seated ourselves .
Slow service but big portions ! Food was good. 

Veggie omelette-really good! 
Mississippi stole potatoes - seasoned so well!
Sausage and bacon - tasty.
Eggs scrambled hard with cheese -
Excellent.
Grits were runny .
Chicken and waffles- chicken lacked seasoning but waffle was delicious with cinnamon in the batter. 
Biscuits were tasty!
Coffee cups ran dry and items were missing due to slow service, however pleasant
Clean and nice atmosphere . Overall, Enjoyed our local taste of Vegas ."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience at M&M, both times I visited I had the Oxtails smothered in gravy. If you like Oxtails or have had oxtail soup, I'm certain that these will be the best that you have had so tender and meaty they come right off the bone.  The pork chitterlings are also very very good for those who eat them. If you don't eat them but wanted to try them, this would be the place to do it.
  The gravy they make is also top notch.  I sampled the collard greens, okra, red beans and rice and yams, all were very good.  A little corn bread pancake comes out with every meal.  The portions come in full and half sizes, the full sizes can probably be shared so you leave room for dessert. 
  The only negative part of the experience would be the climate in the restaurant during the summer months can be a little warm for some but that doesn't take away from a great soul food restaurant that is on the strip."}
{"text":"I was disappointed mainly because of the poor customer service and the lack of response of the managers on site; after waiting nearly an hour to eat my husband was too frustrated to eat - what I tasted; however, was pretty good."}
{"text":"For starters,  the service is very good.   The staff responds like they are happy to see you. The owner shows great pride in his establishment.  Food is seasoned and very tasty.   This is a must if you are in Vegas."}
{"text":"I'm not too much into how a place looks.  I'm a foodie, I just want that stuff to taste good.

The corncakes that they feed you when your waiting for your food is far better than most bread baskets served at restaurants.  The only thing missing was a LITTLE honey, but the edges had a nice crisp to them.  Delicious.  

I got the BBQ hot link as an appetizer.  My wife thinks all hot links just taste like hot dogs.  I agree to some degree, but I know that's what I'm getting when I order it so it doesn't bother me.  The BBQ sauce on that puppy was a celebration in my mouth, and I love how they cut it up for me to slice my pieces off.

We both got the fried chicken and two sides.  I got the mac n cheese and the corn bread stuffing.  My wife got the red beans and rice and the yams.  She wolfed down the red beans and rice and said the yams were sweet enough for her dessert.  I hate to say it but I've had mac n cheese that was so good I'd bathe in it so I don't think I can ever have mac n cheese again since this one (though good) couldn't compete.  I was glad they put gravy on the stuffing not only for flavor, but I think it helped the texture too.  The only problem with the gravy is that is does cool down.  

The fried chicken is the best I've ever had.  Throw some of the hot sauce on it and I was in heaven.  Eat it slow so you can take in the sweet grease in all it's glory dancing with the spices and sweet steamed meat of this perfection of poultry.  I normally hate the skin, but this was just too good.  I'd have that again and again.  

I finished off my meal with the sweet potato pie.  I've never had it, but the meal was going fine to this point so I took a chance.  I enjoyed the flavor, not as strong as pumpkin but some part of the pie were luke warm and other parts were cold.  That's my only complaint on the food.  

Will I go back? Probably.  Soon? Probably not.  It's pretty out of the way for us, but I wanted an experience that was different that what we normally have and I got it.  Just when you walk in I felt transported out of Las Vegas and into the deep south.  Nice hospitality, everyone working there had a smile and were as courteous as could be.  This is a must place visit for those looking for something different with just plain good comfort food."}
{"text":"Jammin' food made with love and soul!! Awesome customer service even the security guard made us feel at home!!!  I got the oxtails with greens, mac & cheese & yam!!! Oxtails fell right off the bones so delicious!!!  I must say I have to minus 1 star since the mac & cheese was not all that as I expected since everything else was on hit. The hubs got the fried chicken with red beans & rice, and maaan it was sooo jammin' seasoned perfect/crispy and moist inside!!  I tried my friend's Kool-Aid yes I said Kool-Aid and boy it was gooooood and I don't even drink Kool-Aid since I was a kid!!!  Great food, service what more can you ask for??"}
{"text":"The food here is really good very southern and I was blown away with the prices.  The services is kind of slow but southern hospitality.  It is so worth going to and will bring back home cooking memories from your childhood."}
{"text":"The family and I had dinner here earlier this evening.

As far as soul food spots goes, this one is among the best in Las Vegas.

I have to be honest, the strip mall that it is located in is not the most visually appealing but don't let that fool you, the food is top notch.

There was a tiny bit of a wait but we were seated rather quickly and greeted by a very friendly staff.

The menu is a basic homestyle soul food with traditional favorites. I started off with the sweet tea which is a personal favorite.

I had catfish dinner with the macaroni and cheese, mashed potatoes and yams. Catfish was seasoned perfectly and the breading was nice and flaky. The mac & cheese was slightly dry but still very good. I have to say I love their gravy.

My kid had the Fried chicken. I'll swing, leg and a thigh to be exact. The seasoning they use the fried chicken is out of this world. Skin was nice and crispy and the meet was nice and juicy. The collar greens were amazing! 

It is all served with peas corn bread pancake looking things. Pretty tasty but I am a more conditional fan of the regular cornbread

The staff was very attentive and very friendly and were quite eager to make sure we had everything we needed.

I'm originally from Los Angeles and have frequent did a lot of the soul food spots. This one by far ranks up there with the top of them. 

I highly recommend trying them for lunch, because they do offer a lunch size portion of it in case you wanted to try a variety of different things."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite restaurants in Vagas! Great hospitality! I always recommend M&M to friends and family. The  hostess have great hospitality very clean and relaxing. 

If I had one complaint it would be their portion sizes."}
{"text":"Last night we went to M&M's soul food. I ordered oxtails, cornbread dressing, yams, and macaroni and cheese. Since it was a holiday they were packed, it took about an hour and a half to get just our order. The oxtails were wonderful, the cornbread dressing was a bit dry as well as the macaroni and cheese. The yams were delicious and the service workers were very very friendly. When I want oxtails I will definitely go back to get oxtails."}
{"text":"Some of the best soul food I have had in Vegas. Mac and cheese was excellent."}
{"text":"amazing service, food, and timing.  what can i say, ooking forward to the next visit."}
{"text":"We got there right after a dinner rush. We only waited a little bit for a table, but everyone was very friendly. Fried chicken was crispy and delicious. Greens were amazing and so was the mac n cheese. Kool aid and sweet tea were both awesome."}
{"text":"Soul food that's good for your soul 

First stop off the plane was the infamous m&ms 

Review: we arrived in Vegas hungry and tired what better way to start the day with a homecooked meal when we arrived we were greeted with hugs and a nice warm welcome seated right away and begin exploring the menu 

Food selection: fried catfish 
fried chicken & hot links 

Sides: eggs waffles yams cabbage corn rice & gravy cornbread & the lemonade sweet tea to wash it down 

Everything came out hot and fresh the catfish was so fresh and clean everything was good and came out in a timely manner customer service was great and we left full and satisfied can't wait to come back here !"}
{"text":"Love the menu.....try the smothered pork chop or baked chicken...collard greens, Mac n cheese and red beans and rice are few of the many available sides. Drinks? No alcohol, but how about a muddy water or better yet just drink the Kool-Aid! For real."}
{"text":"I visit Vegas several times a year. This is my second time at M&M - this time for breakfast - and I was just as impressed as when I had the PERFECT oxtails and hot water cornbread last time. Service is excellent - thank you, Shai and Stephanie.  Added to my list of must do every time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Never ever have I had Kool Aid in a restaurant .... and I have to say it was AWESOME.   Chicken wings were juicy and crunchy, collard greens were great!!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, however if your dying of hunger this is not the place to go. I've seen snails move faster than the cooks and servers, but in light of the authenticity it's overall not a bad experience especially when the servers try to Jedi mind trick you into thinking you ordered something else. The hospitality and attitude of the servers easily change the mood to lift spirits."}
{"text":"Meal started with cornbread pancakes -  very good - tender, crispy on the edges, with that great conrmeal texture.

Ordered the full order of fried chicken - freshly made, excellent preparation - hot, crispy and great flavor.  Had the mac and cheese, red beans and rice and fried okra - all good, mac and cheese and red beans were authentic southern style and particularly good.

Also had a half order of the short ribs in BBQ - tender and well prepared, very good.

All in all a great southern style soul food meal - high quality and definitely had that homemade quality to it - recipes tasted like family home cooking.

Breakfast menu looked very interesting as well - may go back and give it a shot.

This place is very diner in style and decor - a bit run down but reasonably clean - perfectly appropriate for the type of food and price point.  Service was good and wait staff was very friendly.

Recommended for soul food and family dining."}
{"text":"absolutely a bust food was not good! service was below standards
why us it that everyone think they can cook soul food!
very untrue statement!!!
greens... nasty
potato salad.... too much mustard
chicken.....  very bland
beans and rice... no taste
yams... horrible
mac and cheese ...no taste
short rib... so so
cornbread... ok
overall rating .....
poor !!!
miss me with this place.!"}
{"text":"Adore this place!!  Best soul food around.  Okra reminds me of home in Texas."}
{"text":"Best chicken and waffles ever! I came here for the first time in Feb with some friends and family, the people were friendly, their service was EXCELLENT and food is mouth watering! So soo soo good!!  I recently went back a couple weeks ago with some friends, and got the same great service. I am from the San Francisco bay area, and refuse to eat at the chicken and waffle places out here. They are nothing compared to M&M. This place is the best of the best! Ever since I ate at M&M back in Feb I will never eat at another soul food restaurant except for this one.  Next time I go back to Las Vegas this will be my first stop! I highly recommend it to anyone who likes soul food, or just good food in general."}
{"text":"Next time I go to Vegas I will be coming here...they had a great atmosphere with even better food...I had the smothered chicken and tried the friend chicken and smothered chops...the only bad thing about this place is you don't know what to get because all the food looks and taste good...I yea you can get kool aid too"}
{"text":"Old School Diner Look--service was good, food good too when you get it....It was my first time there and I was with some friend, we ordered @ 10:15am and didn't get our food or my food@10:45 only because I mentioned I needed to get to work by 11:30. Everyone else got their food 15 mins. later------geeeeezzzzz! It may be Southern food but we're not in the South where I assume everything's slow paste. 
I had the Chicken Wings and Waffles, the chicken was perfectly cooked and properly seasoned, the waffles looked like they were overcooked and crunchy but they were soft and moist. I think they looked like that because they use vanilla extract. 
Everybody else got the same meal as myself except for A.J. he got the Turkey patty meal which came with a choice of Grit, Fries or Mississippi style potatoes (hash brown potatoes with onions and peppers), toast or a biscuit. His meal looked really good. 
Unfortunately our food took soooo long that by the time we got it we all were alittle P.Oed to really enjoy it."}
{"text":"This place was excellent!  We found it on accident; I had just vetoed a caf across the street when Friend A says, \"What about that place?\"(In hindsight I think he was joking) My boss and I go \"ok\". And off we went. I'll admit that it is not much to look at, but the food more than makes up for that. 
 When we walked in It was like everyone was just kinda hanging out, a nice lady it what looked like a pair of house slippers looked up  from her conversation with a patron at the bar and told us to just sit wherever we wanted.  About 30 seconds or so later someone appeared out of thin air and took our drink order. When we hesitated he began listing off all the drinks they had. I was about to settle when he said the magic word \"kool-aid\" and to top it off it was red flavored.  We took a minute to peruse the menu it made my tummy happy just looking at it. They are one of two places that I have found that has grits that are worth a damn. Other items included fried okra, catfish, fried chicken, meatloaf, liver and onions, red snapper, chitterlings, and a host of other southern classic.  
 I had catfish Mac and cheese and yams. The yams were sweet and juicy but not soggy.  The Mac and cheese had real cheese in it and the catfish was some of the best I have ever had.  Friend L had the liver and onions and friend A had fried chicken. We never agree on anything when it comes to lunch but we agreed that this place was solid.   A word of warning there is a 20 min delay on anything fried and you are going to be hard pressed to get out of here in a hour if you come for lunch. Other than that this place was great."}
{"text":"Every time I come to this place, it\"s always a big disappointment. First of all the place is to small for the heavy foot traffic on weekends especially , too loud, dirty tables, seats and floors. Ended up not ordering anything since me and my girlfriend couldn't decide on sharing a full size order of an entrée. I wanted chicken, she wanted oxtails. Just ate their dry hot cakes with water instead."}
{"text":"I am truly sad that we waited 3 years to try this place out and now can't wait to come back!

We went in on a Friday night after a show in the strip. It does close early at 8pm, so beware but we got there around 7:30pm and everything was fine. It was super busy but we were seated within 2 minutes of coming in. The husband and I got Muddy Waters to drink and they were fantastic. My daughter got sweet tea and she needed to add more sweetener (she's a Texan, through and through). The cornbread pancakes they bring out before your food are yummy and a nice touch.

Service was excellent!

For the meal, I got fried catfish, yams, mac'n'cheese and fried okra. Everything was wonderful and it was the best fried catfish I have had since I moved out of Texas 11 years ago. I didn't even need the tarter sauce that I requested. And the friend okra? Divine! You can definitely tell it is hand battered and not that mushy bland stuff from a bag just tossed in the fryer. DH got the liver and onions, greens, fried okra and mac'n'cheese. He raved about his food, but I'll just have to take his word since I'm not a fan of liver or collard greens. DD got the half order of chicken with fried okra and mac'n'cheese. Her chicken was fabulous, crispy, juicy and flavorful.

We didn't have room for dessert and that made me sad, but $50 for all 3 of us including a tip, definitely made me happy. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Soul food in Vegas?  Yes, please. I saw that M & M was highly rated on Yelp and I wanted fried chicken, so we ventured here. It is way off the strip, we drove into what seemed like a working class neighborhood - when we walked in, they thought we were lost! Once we assured them we wanted to eat, all was well and we were seated. We ordered the smothered fried chicken and the pork chops, with mac and cheese and okra for sides. Everything was super good. The fried chicken skin was crispy and the chicken itself was juicy. The gravy was typical southern brown gravy deliciousness. No complaints on the mac and cheeses or okra either. I actually restrained myself a bit and saved room for banana pudding. My sister had never had southern style banana pudding and she was floored. It was super good!

Definitely a good spot if you want to get away from the buffets of the strip. I'll be back for the chicken and waffles next time!"}
{"text":"This place was garbage....we waited over an hour and 20 minutes for our food. 2 tables that came in way after us got served before us and one completely finished. They brought 1 meal 13 minutes after the others... and it was completely wrong (how do you mix up Catfish and porkchops?) Their reasoning behind the long wait was that they don't like to serve anyone until all orders are done.  The food was mediocre. Mac n cheese tasted like they were frozen.  Greens were salty. Hoe cakes were good (only plus). One member of our party ordered dessert to go...they charged us and then forgot about it! I will NEVER eat here again!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a good soul food restaurant while visiting Vegas. Since there was a location on Las Vegas Blvd we decided to try it. It was just OK. The food was served lukewarm and the gravy didn't really have a taste to it. We all ordered something different and left with over half our food on our plates. The service was great though! Maybe the one on Charleston is better..."}
{"text":"First, the location is conveniently located right off the Strip before the Stratosphere. The dining area is bright and clean. The service was fast and friendly. The food was crispy and homey. Overall, a great lunch/dinner!"}
{"text":"This place is waaaay overpriced and the food is NOT spectacular by far! This is standard dinner a teenage girl trained by her mom can cook nothing special at all the place really needs a deep clean if you ask me! They need to drop the prices"}
{"text":"Food was not the greatest and but the service was good due to the staff being very friendly. The food took forever in a day to come out and once it did we was disappointed to say the least!"}
{"text":"Love the food, not too crazy about the service. A friend and I went, and were standing at the front for about five minutes. We scooted towards the front dining counter area, in hopes we'd be noticed, which we weren't. Finally, my friend walked up to the register to let them know we were waiting on a table. Finally, one of the gentlemen shouted clear across the room to get our attention and waved for us to sit at a table he had ready. I understand that it gets busy, but they gotta work on the service, because the food alone isn't going to suffice. Again, the food was great. I grew up on fried chicken and greens, so to find a place that serves this, and doesn't mess it up is awesome, but the service really needs to improve."}
{"text":"so i finally got up enough guts to ask for more pastry less peaches. what a difference! I gave the gentleman a lil Q&A but he shut me down with i gave u what u asked for, and yes indeed u did my man! good stuff."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, crappy service. Never again. A wanna-be Soul Food place. Waitress never came to check on us, we never got refills on our drinks, and threw the bill on our table and walked away. And this was on a slow day there. Ridiculous. Biggest waste of money and time."}
{"text":"I am from south Carolina and this is the closest thing I have found to southern cooking and the meat and three like you find in the south. Service is great
Jerria is awesome but every body there ask if you need anything. They all are there to serve you. My favorite is the smothered pork chops collard greens yams Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Would def go back. Was visiting a friend and she raved! Get the smothered chicken. The gravy is World Famous and I AGREE! Nice friendly staff. I had the okra and the rice and beans. Very good. The sweet potato pancakes were so good! SOUTHERN Cooking! it is GOOD! It's a funky kinda place so just deal with it and enjoy the crowd there and the food. They greet you right when you come in. They are busy so maybe get it to go. Would def go back when i can afford the calories! ;-)"}
{"text":"First visit was almost a let down.  I ordered a half plate of fried chicken with greens and red beans and rice on the side. My bends were full of flavor and seasoned well. The greens looked good but had a sweet element to them that I did not care for.  I returned my entire plate because my chicken was well below the desired serving temperature, and tasted as if it has been sitting for quite some time. I could tell this by the tough cardboard texture. My waitress took the plate back like she knew the chicken was not right. On the menu it even states \"Be aware there is a 20 minute wait on all fried foods.\" Mine came out in about 8 minutes. I am writing this in real time and still within my 20 minute window for my fresh chicken. The waitress staff is full of beautiful neatly groomed black women in black pants white shirts and bow ties. They greet everyone who comes though the door, and are very professional. My food has arrived and it is hot. Hot foils is always good but my chicken is just average tasting. This location has nothing on the ones I've visited in LA or Long Beach. Bye Felicia!

*note...What's up with the hot sauce?  It's either not very hot at all or I need to lay off the scotch bonnets and jolokia peppers."}
{"text":"The food is good here. We had the smothered chicken with collard greens, fried okra, and mac and cheese and we cleaned our plates. What is really notable about this place, though, is the service and the atmosphere. Our waitress was helpful and friendly and the restaurant has a sort of \"hang out\" feel to it- good music and a diner feel. As we were seated, we were given small complimentary cornmeal pancakes. They were really yummy, probably my favorite part of the meal. 

All in all, a great place to experience something new or come in for some familiar homecooking.

Pros: friendly service, authentic soul food menu

Cons: no kids menu, a bit overpriced"}
{"text":"Came by to try their smothered fried chicken with my friend. Took note that it takes 20 minutes for them to get it out the kitchen to us. We ended up waiting for about 50 minutes with no sign of our food and our water was not refilled even though we had requested it 10 minutes ago. The table next to us that was seated after us and ordered later than us got all their food and then some even though we had ordered the same thing. Horrendous service. Never going back there again."}
{"text":"This M&M restaurant is way better than the one on the strip. Food is always good. Family has been going to this one for over 10 years."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. I ordered my food over the phone and was told it would take 20 min. I arrived 20 minutes later and my order wasn't even put in yet. I was told it was busy but the restaurant was no where near capacity. The server put in my order and told it would be long. 40 minutes later my food still hadn't arrived. I don't really write these but this place is ridiculous. Customer service is horrible here. Looks as if they don't even have a manager on the floor or even in the restaurant period. Being an African-American as well as Chef I was sorely disappointed in this place. I like to support black owned businesses but all to often I find that they lack what it takes to be in the service industry. If you want to make it in this business you need to invest in quality workers front and back of the house. This place lacks both and therefore I want be going back to this restaurant. You only get to strikes and this place has used three. I truly hope whoever owns this place fixes these issues and takes this post seriously."}
{"text":"The food at M&M what's the worst food I ever ate no seasoning on the chicken and greens with no seasoning and the green string beans came out of a can they need to be shame of yourself talking about Mississippi cooking that's not Mississippi cooking"}
{"text":"Love the fried chicken and smothered dishes.  Good thing i don't live close as i would be there every day.   True soul food.   Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Damn good.
I'm a bodybuilder, I know how to eat. This place gave me a ton of damn good food. Staff remembers me every time I come in town for business. It's real southern cooking so be ready. 5/5"}
{"text":"This time out at M&M was disastrous.  Service was horrible.  Ordered smother chicken.  Normally a good choice.  But today, I needed a hammer and chisel to eat the chicken.  Others in my party had similar experiences.  Will not be coming back anytime soon.  The kicker was the waitress spilled water on one of the guest in our party, and never apologized or cleaned up the water spilled.  We were left to clean up!!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service!! Very poor management of employees and customer service. Not enough workers and the food took over an hr to come out! Not that it wasnt already bad enough that I had to fill up on koolaid but our food came out 1 at a time and the last person waited another 25 min. Food was cool but the experience blocked the taste of the food....Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Best breakfast on THE strip!!!!!
Everytime I come to Vegas, M&M is a MUST!!!!!
 & waffles,  & grits, Kool-aid in the mason jar. Everything I have had is THUMBS UP!!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! Great Service! Definitely will come back. Ordered the Chicken Fried Steak Breakfast, it was absolutely one of the best ever. Served over potatoes and a biscuit on top then covered with gravy. I'm going to dream about this meal till next time!"}
{"text":"I wrote a review awhile ago but deleted my account so figured I'd write one again since I recently visited M&M..

This is not the best \"soul food\" that I've ever eaten in my life but in Vegas - it's pretty damn good.  

II always order the same thing - fried chicken with 3 sides.  It's $13.99 and definitely will send you home with a doggy bad.  This time with my chicken I got mac n cheese, string beans and rice and gravy.  I usually get yams but figured I could use some green veggies on my carb ridden plate.

The mac n cheese is always on point.  The string beans were great.  I was worried they might be too salty but they definitely were not. and the rice and gravy - well, I'm a sucker for rice with brown gravy and this gravy is damn good.  My other half also got the same as me but instead had cornbread stuffing and collard greens which he raved about.  

One of the greatest things about this place is the corn pancakes they give you.  They are like CRACK.

If you are looking for stellar service, a trendy atmosphere, etc - this isn't the place for you.  But if you're looking for real \"soul food\" you won't be disappointed.

Side Note:  I had a coupon BOGO from the Entertainment Book stating that you could not use if on holidays.  Apparently - they don't accept them on the weekend.  It wasn't a big deal for me as I would have come here without the coupon but just an FYI for the future."}
{"text":"The best friend chicken my husband and I ever had! And their gravy is so Yums! Pick a side, any side and you won't be disappointed. We enjoyed the pancake bread they give you before your meal too. Mmmm! Don't forget to get their sweet tea or their muddy water! We had lunch there today, and we wanna go back for dinner! Yup! If not tonight we are definitely returning!"}
{"text":"Service was AMAZING!!!  And food was really good. Especially the little cornbread cakes you get with every meal... Yummm!"}
{"text":"Best little hidden gem in Vegas.  Great people, great food, great place!!!"}
{"text":"I went down there today with my family and we had a table for 14 and they fucked up everyone's order. I have never been to a restaurant where they ran out of food. DO NOT EAT HERE. It's very ghetto there and waitress and managers are pathetic. I will never eat SOUL FOOD AGAIN IN VEGAS!!!!! I order ribs and they waited til everyone at my table food to tell me they are out of ribs and everyone at my table got different sides when the food came out because they didn't have enough sides. WTF!!! Never heard of at a restaurant unless your at this fuckin ghetto as place."}
{"text":"I'm notorious for always trying new things but when I come here I turn into an old hag and order the usual - the 2 piece fried chicken with 2 sides lunch special. 

I start out with the complimentary corn bread cakes - very tasty. Ask for extras as they do oblige.

Next wash it off with some ice cold koolaid bc I don't play. 

Out comes the crispy,juicy, moist chicken with my cabbage and collard greens. 

I tear this Shiz up all the time. As David Alan Griers dad says in Boomerang, from the rooter to the tooter!

Side note- I did try the gumbo once and although the portion is huge, it didn't represent the Nawlins style"}
{"text":"If your looking for down home comfort food while in Vegas this is the place to go.  Its nothing fancy just a simple restaurant that kind of reminds you aunts house.  The food is simply southern comfort food and you get plenty of it and not to mention the good service. We will definitely be back on our next trip to vegas."}
{"text":"One of my must-go places whenever in town. I personally never mastered cooking soul food, but why bother when you have places like this?! 

I usually order the catfish. It's perfectly seasoned and the sides are equally as good. The sweet tea is a bit too sweet for me, but that could also have to do with the fact that I'm usually visiting with a hangover. 

The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the ambiance. But just remember you're going for the food and the staff are great!"}
{"text":"I last visited this establishment back in January during the late afternoon during a weekday.

Atmosphere: Atrocious!
Upon entering the restaurant, it was the usual dining experience I would have when I usually came to M&M. However, upon being seathed, I noticed a slight scent in the air that wasn't food. It was more like musk, dust, and humidity. I knew this visit wasn't going to be my best. 

Service: Slow, but got the job done.
There were definitely waitresses on board, but it didn't look like there were many cooks working this day. Upon ordering my food, I was informed by the waitress that the wait would be significantly longer than usual (20+ minutes). I acknowledged this fact since I really wanted soul food this afternoon. The wait didn't feel too long, and I was served my food within the given time period. For my wait, the waitress gave me a free chocolate cake for free upon leaving. Not too bad for service!

Food: Still fantastic!
The hotcakes were awesome, as usual. Hotcakes are always good to start off with, especially with a dab of butter on top! I ordered Fried Chicken with Fried Okra, Collarded Greens, and Rice. I felt the food was too acidic at one point, but that was my fault for what I had ordered.

Overall:
My last visit here left me a bad impression. I will never look at this restaurant the same again. This was my only \"bad\" visit. I will definitely visit this place again, and for anyone who wants to try soul food, this place is great! However, I'll enter with more caution next time I visit this place."}
{"text":"Wow, good stuff!  Staff is super friendly and chef is very accomodating.  My cousin ordered the fried chicken breast as boneless and they didn't hesitate to fulfill her request.  Wow, talk about top notch southern fried chicken!  The chef came out to make sure she was pleased, too!  The cornbread pancakes were yummy as a starter.  I had the fried cat fish with sides of collard greens and mac & cheese.  There are full and half orders.  Half orders are already big in portion, so you are warned LOL  My party of 4 shared a sweet potato pie ... OMG to die for!!!  Highly recommended.  Enjoy the celebrity photos/guests on the wall who enjoyed the restaurant, too."}
{"text":"WASTE OF TIME.

We were staying across the street at Stratosphere and I was really excited to finally try M&M after not being able to get down to their Carson, CA location. However, after waiting for our food for 45 minutes (posted estimated wait time is 20 minutes) and after the TABLE NEXT TO US (who ordered AFTER is) receiving their food, we gave up and left. And, the place was not even half full. Despite waiting for the food (kitchen's fault), the servers were rude and horrible as well. 

After coming to this location, even though I WAS excited to try M&M out, I am sad to say I NEVER WANT TO EAT AT ANY OF THEIR LOCATIONS AND HAVE ADVISED MY WHOLE GROUP OF FRIENDS TO DO THE SAME."}
{"text":"As someone originally from the southeast, I was not impressed by the food or the service. The music was loud, the dressing was shameful, and our server was rachet. The fried okra was good, but you could get the same from \"churches chicken\". The cornbread and sweet tea were on point, but not good enough to tolerate our server saying \"ya'll black, but we get a lot if ni#@as in here\". Food but not soul food."}
{"text":"I have been here a lot for breakfast.  I love the catfish and grits with eggs.  The chicken wings are also great for breakfast.  I went here for lunch and I had the catfish with fired okra, cabbage and red beans and rice, all were wonderful.  My guest had the fried chicken with mac and cheese and the red beans and rice and the green beans.  It was her first time and she was blown away. The server was very friendly and out going and made our short wait seem even shorter by bantering with us.  This is a must for anyone who loves soul food."}
{"text":"We were looking to try the Soul food that Las Vegas has to offer. We made the horrible choice of going to M&M soul food cafe. We ordered take out to take back to our hotel. We waited almost 40 minutes for our food. Once we received the food we ended up eating in the car because we were starving. Usually when your hungry the food is great. No not here! The food was horrible. You know it's horrible when they cannot fix french fries. I really wish I didn't waste my money of the food."}
{"text":"This is a must every time I visit Vegas . the oxtails are out of this world,  the meatloaf I want to slap somebody,  the corn cakes phenomenal, Fried Chicken seasoned and flavorful and let's not forget my once-a-year favorite the chitlins and muddy water dang! Lastly the gumbo ,well y'all already know ! I don't even have to go there. This is absolutely every big boyz heaven"}
{"text":"Sorry...but I can't understand the average of 3/4 stars reviews.
First of all I was totally ignored by the waitress. After 10 min she took my order.
1 FULL beef ribs 
Sides: rice, fried okra and mash potato
For $ 22.00
When I got home and opened the box I was absolutely chocked by the amount of food! There was not enough food for a kid to eat. 
And they forgot my fried okra.
The service is horrible! Never again!"}
{"text":"Ate brunch at M & M prior to leaving Vegas. Greeted us as soon as we came in the door, but were poorly staffed. Food took a long time. My parents had chitterlings, collard greens and Mac and cheese they loved ever bit of them. My husband and I had a southern breakfast of chicken wings and catfish nuggets with grits and eggs. I also had an order of fried green tomatoes. My dish was the only one not prepared correctly. Tomatoes were too greasy, fish nuggets were fried too hard and my eggs were scrambled hard (I asked for soft). I was disappointed but gave a three because the others were satisfied."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Good eating. Like being back home.  Gotta check out the small places in Vegas often times the best places are off the beaten path"}
{"text":"The service was god awful. We waited a long time for our food to arrive. I had chicken & waffles. The waffles were to crispy. The chicken wings were dry & tough. I had to ask for a refill on my Coffee which was weak. They only have margarine, which I hate & never buy or use. No butter. There is no communication with the kitchen & waitress. My Fiancé Ordered the 2 piece chicken & got 2 wings no breast. The waitress just put his plate down & left. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I have eaten at the one in LA so hoping this one was just as good.  Nope.  So unorganised.  You walk in and there is sign for you to have a seat to wait to be seated.   I and another wanted to place a to go order, so we walk to the counter.  After 5 min we are told to sit down.  Then we wait...people are seated, seated.  We are asked if we are next.  I advise we want to place a to go order, \"Okay come sit at the counter\".  Seriously! WTH!  Wait five more MIN.  Place our order and wait 20 min.  We are chatting so not to bad.  Not offered water or anything while we wait.  NOT crowded at all!  I get my smothered chicken home, blah!  Mashed potatoes, blah.  mac n cheese..okay.  Corn pancakes...Great!  peach cobbler, blah!  Never going back.  TC's Rib Crib 1000 times better!"}
{"text":"One word.....NASTY! Horrible soul food, sugar coma cornbread and ratchet service. Use to love the one in LA 10 years ago, was there recently and it was mediocre too."}
{"text":"This place gets no stars but yelp making me check at least one they don't deserve it got in there and they hand you a menu and ask what you want and never show back up to serve you after waiting for 20mins or more I left no good customer service at all. After that I guess I won't be trying their food since I can't get served plus I ask other customers how is the food they said it's ok not all that lol."}
{"text":"I came here with no expectations since it didn't seem like much from the outside but I was happy once I received my food. I had the short ribs with gravy and a side of mac and cheese and cabbage. The ribs were so tender and delicious, the mac and cheese was good but needed a little more melted cheese on top. My boyfriend had the chicken and waffles and the chicken was really good."}
{"text":"1. Poor customer service...ATTITUDE 
2. The oxtails were salty and cold
4. Beans and Rice was dry 
5. The gumbo was tasteless 
6. The catfish arrived 20 minutes AFTER everyone ate
7.  In the picture, you can see how much food was left over."}
{"text":"O M G!!! DELICIOUS... Everything thing was great I had the Chitterlings, Greens, Mac and Cheese with a Chicken and Waffle on the side...mmm good!!! My Son had the Catfish, Yams, Mac and Cheese with Chicken and Waffle... Consistent and Good"}
{"text":"Ummm where do I start? Took forever to order and get drinks waitress just simply had a bad attitude..,Food was a mess sides tasteless fish fried way to hard chicken was ok but could of been seasoned a lil better .. most likely will not return"}
{"text":"No doubt that the food is great and the portions are large.  As busy as they are, they still manage to be very polite and the overall atmosphere is nice.  They should use some of the profits to update the dining area.  The padded benches are so old and worn out that you tend to sink when you sit on them.  That is why they get 4 stars instead of 5.
-------------------

Ok, they updated the furniture so I have to change my review from 4 stars to 5 stars  Again, the food is 2nd to none.  EllaEms run a close 2nd place, but I have to admit that M&M's is the best as far as taste.  I hope M&M don't move to a more upscale location.  I love the hole in the wall feel.

Nice touch that the owner is always around.  He greets and checks on the customers.  He waits on them too.  He is a young man which is nice to see these days."}
{"text":"Located on Las Vegas Boulevard, just south of Sahara, this is the second location for M&M in Vegas. If you have a hard time finding it, look for the Holiday House Motel on the East side of the road. They are in the same parking lot, which features excellent views of the Aztec Inn (which I hear has a great buffet by the way) & an Ihop...ok, kidding about the views. But this new location is definitely much larger then the first, with quite a bit more seating and a lot more of an open feeling. Everything else remains just about the same, including the styling, menu, etc.

While this was my first visit to this new location, I've been to the original a couple times. I've tried quite a few different things at the other that I wasn't happy with, but I'll save that for another review of it. At this location I ordered something I've never gotten before, Smothered Pork Chops. For $14.99 you get two pork chops and 3 sides. The pork chops themselves were on the smaller side, pretty tough and also dry. Since they were smothered, it wasn't too bad eating them, but the texture of the gravy was a bit weird and it was way too salty. Besides helping the meat be more edible, it didn't really do anything for the plate. For my 3 sides, I chose greens, cornbread dressing and fried okra. It could just be new opening issues, but besides the greens, all the sides were lacking. The dressing was extremely grainy and also covered in the overly salted gravy. Okra was basically flavorless and seemed barely fried making them too greasy. Overall, the sides just weren't what I'm used to getting from the other location.

Unfortunately, the same could be said for the service. Our waitress was friendly for the most part, but I felt a bit rushed and they were having strange issues with getting drinks. When we first sat down, they completely skipped me when taking drink orders and then brought out the wrong drink to a couple people in our party. When it came time for refills, they had almost no clue what anyone was drinking and had to come back more then once to ask. They were also bringing out warm tea without refilling ice, or even just bringing out extra glasses of ice. Some of this could have partially been the fault of the busser, who looked like he was on his first day, but with only 1 other table sat during most of our meal, it was pretty frustrating. We got checked on a couple times, but again, the service just wasn't like what we get at the original location.

There were a few things however that matched what we're used too. Maybe most importantly, but it was the cornbread pancakes and fried chicken. Those little fluffy cakes brought out before your meal are absolutely delicious and if I could, I'd probably order like a half stack of those things by themselves. They also seem to be executing the fried chicken well. I only had a small bite, but I had no complaints. It had nice crispy, salty skin and was cooked just right. Very juicy and not a hint of dryness. There's definitely a reason they're known for that chicken.

Now, when the employees at the Charleston location told us about this new one opening a couple months ago, they told us it was going to be open 24 hours. It looks like those plans changed, and they're only going to be open 24 hours during some portions of the summer. I guess at this time, they are thinking only weekends in the summer time. All other times they'll be open from 7am - 9pm. Breakfast is served up until either 10am or 11am, depending on the day of the week.

Really, I'm still torn on M&M. With as many things as I've had at the other location that I didn't like, I can't say for certain that I'd give that one any more than 3 stars either. But with this one having both service and food that just doesn't compare to the original, I'd say it's a solid 2.5 that I'm rounding up to a 3 since they're new. We may be back if we were in the area, but I'd much rather visit the original location for the time being."}
{"text":"Excellent food (especially the fried chicken). The staff was very friendly and efficient. I will note: a \"large\" entree is a lot of food. I wouldn't order a large entree unless you're either VERY hungry or sharing with a friend."}
{"text":"The first thing is the music! It will take you back for sure! Puts you in the mood for that down south home cooked meal that your big mama would get up before the chickens to fix for you and the rest of them knot head cousins. I had the famous chicken and waffles. It was divine. Nothing like drinking out of a mason jar lol. Sad that I had to come all the way from San Diego to Vegas in order to get some good chicken and waffles.
So the next time y'all want a real southern home cooked meal and you're in Vegas make sure y'all  cruise on by M & M's.  Service is fast and friendly. Nice to hear a big hearty \"Hey, how y'all doing? Come on in.\""}
{"text":"This place was good.  It was my first time here.  My friend kept telling me about this place so we went in for dinner.   I  got the fried chicken which was a wait but  it was worth the wait.

The side dishes I got were just ok nothing great. My side dishes were mashed potatoes, mac&cheese and rice&gravy. The rice was really hard I couldn't eat it.  The mac&cheese didn't taste that good but it was edible. I  tried my friends yams they were really good. 

I  would go back again for the  fried chicken."}
{"text":"Really dig this place. I may go back there for breakfast on my last morning in town! Looking through reviews, it's a really mixed bag. Seems folks have issues with a person, a wait, go on a bad day and so they give it one star. I call B.S. This place is a solid 4 as far as I\"m concerned.

Left the hotel in search of breakfast my first morning. Walked by this place but kept on walking because I had a destination mind (thanks Yelp!). Somehow I couldnt locate it. I managed to find the hotel it sits in but still once inside got turned around. Was in a mood so just huffed off. I probably walked 40 minutes, passing nothing of consequence but managed to leave the largest souvenier shop in the WORLD spending only a few $.

By the time I headed back around towards my hotel, I was famished and even more annoyed. Cut to the moment I once again saw this beacon across the street. All of a sudden everything fell into place. Breakfast was over but I'm not the biggest chicken and waffle fan anyway. But I AM the biggest fried chicken and sides fan in the world!

I was one of a few white folks in there. Any jew who eats chinese food (which btw is EVERY jew) knows that's how you know whether or not you should eat there. And I bet the white people were all southern. I hope I don't get in trouble for this one, as my loud mouth often gets me.

I really enjoyed my chicken. Crispy, moist (that word!) and deliscious. Cooked perfect. I've never had corn cakes before and I am in LOVE! Please give me these every day and I will never eat a pancake again. Mashed potatoes was great. The green beans were canned which wasn't awesome for me, so I asked instead for collard greens. I will admit I did not love them, but the caveat is that I'm still new to collard greens and sometimes I like them, sometimes not. Still trying to figure out why and since I don't cook them it's harder.

The decor is kinda cafeteria and bare bones with some cool stuff on the walls. The place on Friday around 11 was fairly busy but many seats were still open in the front area as it's a big space! All this for just $10 for the two pieces and sides. No way! YES! Love M & M cafe!"}
{"text":"Service fantastic! Food excellent! Unfortunately, they did not have the corn bread pancakes ready in the morning. I think it's usually a lunch thing so if you go and try it, review so I can hear about it.. Since I won't be in Vegas anytime soon. :o/

PS. The best thing they had was the grilled biscuits. Freakin' heaven on a plate!!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed at the service and the food we sat for a hour waiting on our food, the place wasn't busy at all , we asked to speak with the manager and out food miraculously showed up, my wife ordered liver and onions and the onions were burnt and the liver tough, my food was cold and the corn wasn't cooked at all. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Just visited this restaurant and I should have followed my first mind and left after waiting over 45 minutes even though the sign says sign in three ring binder. Well no one ever looked at it,party of four seated before us (4) also. I suppose the staff was too busy arguing amongst themselves (waitress with curly blond hair and cook). Food finally arrives and smothered chops just okay,rice with gravy(about a teaspoon ) worth. Meatloaf extremely salty and not done. Mac and cheese out of the box. Best thing about the meal was red kook-aid and sweet tea. Credit is due to waitress with red hair,she was very nice, she apologized for the shortcomings but not enough for return visit. I only gave one star because you have too. We (blacks) can only blame ourselves when our businesses fail."}
{"text":"Good catfish, the peach cobbler is amazing get it a la mode. The sides were all ok something I could have made better at home we had the greens and mac n cheese just bland. Oh also the hot corn cakes are amazing my kids love them too i order at least 2 extra."}
{"text":"Service sucks! Food ok. Waiter forgot  2 of our orders....
Service was suck! A fight almost broke out cus another Customer was waiting too long / or they forgot the food! Crazy!"}
{"text":"We met up with dear friends for dinner tonight at 6:30 on Charleston. They do not take reservations and we were glad we got there a bit early.
Catfish, red snapper, fried okra, red beans, lemonade, oxtails, and fried chicken were ok. 
I may be a Boston girl but my friends have cooked real soul food and this cook is not the greatest.
We looooved the corn cakes though.
Warm lemon cake and sweet potato pie were an ok dessert.
The place was hopping- they had to turn multiple parties away as they close at 8pm but they have another location at the Strip.
We probably watched 30 people who could not get in be redirected to the other restaurant. And they were upset.
This obviously is a good social spot and the staff are good: with an upgrade in food it could be amazing."}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles are outstanding.   The chicken is too damn delicious.  Staff is super nice.   Decor could use help and is the only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars.   Visit this place at least once while in Vegas..... you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Some good and some bad here. Let's start with the bad. The sides. They were crap. Nothing good I can say about any of the sides. If they did a better job on all their sides, I'd give 5 stars. Nothing tastes fresh and homemade. It was all out of cans and really bad. Now for the good. The free hocakes we got were delicious. The hot link app was spicy and covered in BBQ sauce goodness. Now the best part, the smothered fried chicken. Where do they get such huge pieces of chicken??? My chicken leg was as big as a turkey leg!!! The gravy was legit. Chicken still had a bit of crunch to It even after the gravy blanket. The entire staff was super friendly and my kool aid was always full. Given that our table was the only table with Asians here, I did not feel out of place at all. Definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Just left  tonite @8:30pm. Really good food horrible service. Ordered my favorite..the meatloaf, she said  we outta that, didn't refill coffees, kept bringing 1 creamer w/ my coffee, I take at least 4' food took approx.1 hour and 10 muh.fuh. Minutes. What gives. I still tipped her $6.00 Because she was nice and apologetic for the long wait. Restaurant was nearly empty. All the girls were nice though. The fried chicken and the porkchops were to die for,and came out piping hot,burnt my tongue,but so  delicious, make you wanna slap yo mama. Lot of street traffic guys coming and going back and forth in and out, I'm thinking we bout to get robbed up in this shady joint. Took some fried chicken home, so good I am eating it cold.my gosh the crust is miraculous. Forget the shoddy service and stay for the food .p.s. The Greens are great, red beans and rice came out cold and so did the cornbread......if you are Caucasian be afraid that big security fella ain't there anymore or at least he wasn't we'd.nite"}
{"text":"I've bean coming M & M's since they first opened 10 years ago and it's so exciting to see the growth and expansion. I love the cozy family atmosphere. The staff is extremely attentive and courteous and the food is quite tasty. I love the chicken and waffles for breakfast and for the dinner I love the smothered chicken. The sides are delicious too!!! I appreciate that after 10 yrs I can come in and feel like I'm at home. So if you're looking for good down home soul food this is the best place to get some. And I'd like to shout out Frank the waiter. He's so sweet and genuine, I honestly look forward to going there and seeing him...."}
{"text":"Great customer... Food came out really fast. Service is amazing, I love coming here when I'm in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Love love love it! I always eat off the strip when coming to Vegas   Fried chicken, red beans n rice, yams, banana pudding. U crave it? Go get it!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch before we hit the road home.  I ordered oxtails, Mac & cheese, collard greens and cornbread stuffing.  My husband had fried snapper, potato salad, yams and cabbage.  There was a lot of food and the service was good."}
{"text":"First time here..very good soul food reminds me of the original in LA...clean, air conditioned, and fast service with a  very frindly staff...definitely goin back soon...I had the fried fish with yams, mac&cheese,and red beans&rice and hot links.. My wife had Red Snapper and same sides..they also give u these corn bread like pancake things that are delicious...highly recommended if you want some good ole southern home cookin with a smile"}
{"text":"I normally love this restaurant, but today I just had the worst experience here!!!  I expect there to be a wait to be seated. I even expect to wait a little while for my food when they are busy, but today my husband waited for over an hour (after waiting 20 minutes to be seated) just to find out that our order had never been put in. I know that things happen but our server was so focused on the large party that she didn't check on us to follow up. I wish I would have gotten the young lady's name who did finally check on us because she was very sweet and could have saved our experience if our food been ready!!!!!"}
{"text":"I honestly wish I could give no stars. 1. The server was not pleasant. When we asked for a manager the waitress was rude about it. 2. The music is SO loud we had to almost yell to hear each other speak. 3. The food. Smh. It was so salty. The macaroni & cheese was SO salty, the yams tasted like syrup, the greens had no flavor but very salty and the red beans and rice taste like they were out of a can. The only thing that was good was the chitterlings. My friends ordered catfish and smothered pork chops and they were both very salty. We didn't eat ANYTHING. My friend threw up the food was so disgusting. I won't be back again. Save your money. If they offered a gift certificate, I still wouldn't take it."}
{"text":"I don't like paper plates and plastic forks and spoons for soul food"}
{"text":"Went here recently after enjoying it on our first trip last year and the service seems to be going down. We waited well over an hour and a half for our food to arrive. Our waitress had a really snotty attitude when she overheard my husband complaining about the service and wait. Obviously, they ran out of food and didn't tell us but, continued to tell us we'll be served shortly. Instead, we saw a guy arrive with boxes of food coming in from the store and then, about 45 minutes later, food was being served. People that arrived after us were being served food. Obviously, they weren't being served chicken or fish because that is what my party ordered. We spoke briefly to our previous waitress (Relly) from our prior trip who is so sweet, as she was getting off work. All I can say is, DO BETTER! We spend a lot of money when we come to your restaurant. However, the food is still decent."}
{"text":"Kool-Aid, corn cakes and Ox tails! Oh my! We hit the jackpot when we found this gem on our way to Old Las Vegas. We are from Texas and when we saw the soul food sign we had to stop. The greens and cabbage delicious! The peas weren't to my liking but I'll let it slide because I like my peas cooked a certain way. The yams... Oooo so good. The Oxtails were tender and the smothered chicken was delicious! It was so good we ate there twice while in town."}
{"text":"Ate here a few months ago and let me say it was off the hook. The staff is attentive, the servings are large and tasty and the prices are reasonable. A nice mom and pop place for some great soul food for those who like to venture off the strip."}
{"text":"I have been going here for YEARS. The food is good and the staff is ALWAYS nice. 

PROS: Fried snapper
           Macaroni & cheese
           Oxtails
           Brown gravy
           Service/Staff
           Chitterlings
           Potato salad 
           Peach cobbler

CONS:  Cornbread stuffing (mine was super dry)
             Small portions for the chitterlings full order. 

I like taking out of town visitors here because the food is so good. Everyone I've taken has really liked it so I know it's a great place.  It's really hard to find chitterlings and I like theirs better than Soul Food Cafe but the portions are small. But they are small everywhere I've had therm."}
{"text":"The food here is good, and I've never had the pleasure of going there when it was busy or dirty. Every staff member greeted me with a smile and treated us exceptionally well! Food came out fast, fresh and good! I recommend you give them a try!"}
{"text":"First time we came to breakfast here. Had the smothered pork chops. They were good,but cold. We had five in our party four of us got food,then my girl had to wait about five mins for her food. Don't think we will be back for breakfast. Never had a bad lunch here. It might be because we always get the same waitress, and this time she wasn't here. And for 65.00 dollars for breakfast it should be hot."}
{"text":"This is a great off the beaten path place.  Very small and not fancy but great prices, great food and excellent service.  A great place to grab a quick breakfast or lunch before you hit the casinos.  We had the chicken and Waffles and the hash.  The chicken has the greatest crisp skin and seasonings, and the hash was very crispy, the grits were also very good.
Stephanie was our waitress and did an excellent job"}
{"text":"I'm from Colorado and I've been coming to M & M's for years.  Love the pork chops & the corn cakes. But now with the corn cakes you now only get 2 and the size is not consistent. Some came as small as the bottom of a drinking glass and some came the size of a small pancake. Also, I was quite disappointed with this location. The lobby chairs need to be replaced. I had a back injury and couldn't sit down because the cheap plastic chairs are worn out. Instead of being upright, they are now slanted towards the ground. So, I had to go outside and sit on a cement ledge on what I think was the patio. I went to the bathroom which smelled horrible and when I touched the top of the stall, it was extremely dusty as if it had not been cleaned in months. It took 5 times before the toilet would flush the tissue paper. The food is good but, atmosphere is everything. Take it to go."}
{"text":"Love love LOVE this place. First and foremost, the cornbread pancakes. I could seriously eat these every day for the rest of my life. Savory and just slightly sweet.

I had the smothered fried chicken and it was fantastic. The chicken stays crispy, even with the amazing gravy that it has been dipped in. The gravy is practically it's own food group. The chicken is moist and tender and easily the best fried chicken I have had in Vegas. The sides were awesome too, especially the collard greens and the yams. Got a piece of sweet potato pie to go and it was awesome. 

The service is excellent, the servers are all friendly and fast and you can tell there's a real camaraderie among them. 


I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I actually would have giving this restaurant 5 stars about 3 years ago but it has TOTALLY changed. I am actually VERY disappointed because I use to come here every other weekend. It takes forever to get the food to your table and the service is pretty mediocre. This place use to be AWESOME and now I have to find another soul food establishment to spend my money with."}
{"text":"Terrible service. The restaurant wasn't even full. We were greeted walking in the door; however, we sat at the bar for over 30 minutes waiting for someone to take our to go order. If my mother wasn't asking for it I would have walked out. Nice nasty service is what we received. I will not come here again!"}
{"text":"I love going to this place! Their red snapper is delicious! Their chicken and waffles dish is good too."}
{"text":"2 stars because the women working were very nice

I ordered shrimp and grits with a small side of yams

Yams very good
Shrimp and grits was horrible I only had 4/5 shrimp and the grits had no flavor or seasoning beside the run off from the shrimp. It needs some cheese or more seasoning/ something to pull it together , or even more shrimp would help. 

All in all was $13.80 or so for the take out order. 
Price was okay not great. 
Won't be coming back which sucks cause I work right down the street and looking for new lunch spots."}
{"text":"The food was just ok! The greens was bitter and cabbage was cold! The cornbread was the best thing. The service was horrible!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Great staff! Great food! It's clean! Everyone is welcoming! If you get Jennifer as your server you really won't be disappointed! I will be back again & again! Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Great Service
Hard to find
Food is OK...too salty for me (gravy) Greens had a lot of stalk pieces. Pork Chop was tough to cut. Yams..no butter or brown sugar (straight out of a can), loved the sweet tea.  My husband had ox tails which he loved...but agreed on the greens and the fried okra was not good."}
{"text":"Best soul food in Vegas.  Lots of food.  Hubby's first time, and he loved every bite.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was somewhat surprised... The food here was pretty darn good. I had the smothered chicken, Mac and cheese (where 99% is usually garbage) potatoes and gravy and cornbread dressing with gravy on it. Also had lemonade and cool aid mix drink that was very tasty. I really liked the smothered chicken was very very good. The Mac and cheese passed muster... Not the best ever but good which is a hard thing to do!! All was great except I did not care for the cornbread stuffing... Too sweet. 
My wife had the meatloaf, she said the flavor was good by was very dry. The yams were also way too sweet.
It took a little bit for the food to come out, but the service was very good. I will be back, a nice treat."}
{"text":"Greeted by hostess and seated right away! Very cheerful servers and the vibe was really nice. Great r&b music in the background. Place was decently clean.
They gave a complimentary corn cake which was really good! I ordered a basic chicken waffles. Chicken had a bit of hair in it which kinda made me not eat it. The chicken though was good. Crispy and it wasn't dry. The waffles were okay. I'm not much fun of cinnamon if you are then you will enjoy it."}
{"text":"I was visiting in the Bay area on a girls trip this past October and we were staying down the street from this place. We had just had a really long day in San Francisco and were starving. I saw on here that this place was pretty good and it was relatively close to our hotel, so we decided to stop by. I will admit it was about 15-20 mins to closing when we pulled up but we figured if we're just getting it to go it would be okay, right? Wrong. We saw them bringing in the patio chairs and I asked them were they closed they said no, but that they didn't have any food. Like what? Lol . How do you not have anymore food. I felt as though they simply said that so that they wouldn't have to cook us anything right before closing. Needless to say we didn't eat there nor will I ever whenever I am in town."}
{"text":"This place has been busy every time we've been, and understandably so. The food is consistently good and the servers are always friendly. Even the cook has popped out now and then to give us a friendly nod of recognition. The fried chicken is just great, as are pretty much all the sides I've tried : red beans and rice, green beans cooked with bacon and potatoes, rice and gravy, etc.,, but my absolute faves are the yams in syrup - always hot and the perfect amount of sweet, and their amazing cornbread dressing that I wish I could make at home. I would be the Queen of Thanksgiving! Banana pudding would put a smile back on Paula Deen's face. My only quarrels: I wish they were open a little later - 8 pm comes awfully quick, especially in summer, and I know it's soul food, but I wish they at least offered a couple of lighter options like fresh fruit or green salad. Again, in summer, gravy-covered everything can get mighty oppressive."}
{"text":"The food was just Ok. We waited over an hour before we got our food once we were seated. I didn't get my food until 20 mins after the rest of the people in my party. The servers seemed to be busy, but the place was only maybe half full...so idk. This was my first time and will certainly be the last."}
{"text":"M&M is my first brush with Las Vegas Valley soul food. And I just gotta say, WOW. I was blown away at first bite.

The very first time I came here, it was because of my boyfriend. Even though he is Chinese, he was raised on an island, so he periodically gets cravings for island food classics, like oxtail soup. One of his friends had told him to head over to the California Hotel and Casino to this random diner for the best oxtail soup in town.

We get there and find out, they only serve the soup on Sundays. It's all in the details, right? Anyway, long story short... His craving for oxtail soup had not been satiated. Another friend told him to check out M&M, if he likes oxtails so much.

When we arrived, the first thing you notice about this restaurant is the energy. The place is just buzzing with people and the vibe is an energetic one. The servers are very upbeat and talkative.

I decided to get a classic, Smothered Chicken. It is the fried chicken dish, but coated in this delicious brown gravy-esqe sauce. I believed at the time that I had made the best decision, hands down. The bf ordered.... Wait for it.... OXTAIL. I was more about that chicken at the time, honestly.

But when the food came out- wooooooo! Those oxtails were looking really, really good. The chicken was yummy, of course. But as I was munching, he decided to hand me his fork with a bit of the oxtail on it.

Oh. Lawd. Yes.

Now, we both always order the oxtail whenever we go. It's fabulous. It's a bit on the pricy side (the large order comes with three oxtail and three sides for $17.99 or so), but every bit worth it. I think there must be crack in this dish, cuz it's that good.

Another tradition of ours to to get the kool-aid to drink, which is super sweet and comes in a mason jar, but it's just the way I like it. When I was little, I used to hate going over to other people's houses that didn't know how to make kool-aid. It would be all watered down... Not M&M! They keep the \"half a bag of sugar\" custom alive and well here.

The cornbread is not made in bricks, but instead formed into these thin, light mini pancake sort of things. So tasty.

The side dishes are all delightful as well, but some are better than others. A few of my faves are the mac and cheese, the yams (they are candied), and the mashed potatos with gravy.

I still need to try the other Soul Food places in town to really get the picture, but aside from my auntie Carla's cooking, this is gonna be a tough act to beat."}
{"text":"The veggie plate is spot on!!   If your craving momma's southern cooking this is your place!!  YUMMY!!  The prices are fantastic."}
{"text":"I will give this location   a negative   1000 not an exaggeration  over 2 hours and 45 minutes before we got pur food. And it was awful no flavor porkcops smothered in gravy and we needed steak knives to try and cut through   they were   so hard. Greens, cabbage, and macaroni   and cheese just dry. The only thing that was decent   was the kool aid. The original   location needs  to   send over the chef and the kitchen   manager to teach them how to cook large portions and put a system   in place for better rotation of food preparation .  Also don't   tell people it is going to be an hour and a half to get your food after   you  have   waited an hour to be seated. Advise that in the beginning   to give people   an option  if they even   want  to   stay. I will   NEVER   come to this establishment  again. I will also advise everyone   i know to avoid this place like the plague. Posting on Facebook  and   instagram ."}
{"text":"Awesome soul food place. Oxtail and fried okra are the bomb. Super tender oxtail and okra is fried perfectly. 

Honorable mention to the catfish as well. Cool local joint with friendly service. 

Would recommend."}
{"text":"This soul food in Sin City was exactly what I needed. I had the catfish which was cooked to perfection. The waitress seemed a little occupied, especially when it got busier but she was still attentive. This review would be perfect if only we had at least been offered refills. 

Ps. 
The Kool-aid was on point!"}
{"text":"The best food I ever had in my life.....out of the five nights I stayed in Vegas....I eat here four times.....everything is delicious....especially their chicken.....very inexpensive....great comfortable restaurant..playing the oldies but goodies for music ....makes you feel like you at grandma's house...."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my first time in November be this time today was terrible. Services was bad, we waited 20 mins for 2 water, a Coke & kool-aid. Then waited almost 1 hours for food. We never seen our waitress at all. Idk what going on but this is the worst ever point blank. They discounted our bill but the discount wasn't enough for how long we have had to waited & the bad service we had. I don't recommend coming here for soul food."}
{"text":"M&M Soul Food Resturant 2211 W. Charleston, Las Vegas. I guess Friday was not a good time to dine. Wait time was about fourty minutes, had to keep reminding the Waitress about our position in line. Their was no placing of names on list so it was like waiting in a Barber shop. At least three in our party of nine wanted Ox tail, Only to be told ten minutes after ordering that M&M had run out. Asked for Short Ribs, Sorry not available. Sitting on the right side of restaurant resulted in our party being blasted by the SUN setting in the West. There was no shade except for the occasional high profile vehicle that passed by on West Charleston blocking the SUN. The place is NOISEY, do not expect a nice quiet place or folk speaking to each other in normal volume. Imagine being in a Prison chow hall if you will. The food was \"okay I suppose\". My Meatloaf was cold in fact the string beans were hotter. We received our food before we got utensils to eat with. Orders were mixed up and at the very end when the Bill was presented, lo and behold the Ox tail was on the Bill. I believe if I live to be 100, I would not want to eat at M&M ever again. Ghastly!"}
{"text":"Loved the food and the service. If you ever stop by ask for Toni. She's super pleasant."}
{"text":"I went here a while back so my review isn't the most up to date but I'll get to it anyway. If you were to ask me what to order to not be disappointed I would tell you to bet on the chicken and waffles. The best I've had, and that's with a lot of restaurants being considered. Regardless they had a cinnamony taste so look out for that"}
{"text":"If you're craving soul food-this is the spot. Overall excellent experience. The fried fish was delicious--the MAC and greens were good although a little heavy handed on the salt the day we went. I did not care for the potato salad at all.. too much vinegar?No regrets tho--excellent meal. Don't waste your money on those fast fried chicken chains--eat here."}
{"text":"Where do I start? Kind and down to Earth people. Service was Great. I don't even cat fish and it was Off The Chain! Chicken and Waffles  Awesome.... and to top all of that Kool-Aid in a Mason Jar it doesn't get more southern than that"}
{"text":"M&M soul food the food was ok my mother in law cooks better food ever Monday just because you make soul food your attitude need to give better service to all people"}
{"text":"Always fantastic. When I'm on that side of town and its lunch time, we def go.  This restaurant has the best soul food sides, hands down! The fried chicken is average, I've had better homemade. But I love the side dishes especially the fried okra and red beans and rice."}
{"text":"My review in one word-wow! This place is the spot for authentic southern food. This is not a hipster version, inspired, or fusion southern food. Comparing it to that is ridiculous. This is what your southern grandmother would take pride spending all day making from scratch with love. The ultimate comfort food. 

Upon entering I was promptly greeted by several smiling and welcoming waitresses. I decided to dine in and they asked me to sit wherever I wanted. I did and was greeted again at my table and given a menu. I was thrilled to find out that they had sweet tea. I looked at the menu and was delighted to see so many choices that reminded me of my childhood. I went with the half order of the fried pork chop with collard greens and macaroni & cheese. 

When they brought my drink I was pleasantly surprised to see that they brought me cornbread as well. The cornbread was in the shape of a pancake. I didn't understand the reasoning until I tasted it.  OH MY GOODNESS! This was so yummy. The cornbread had the right amount of sweetness and the pancake shape meant the delicious crispness of the edge was all over the piece of bread.  I can't believe I haven't had it like this sooner. 

When my food arrived I was pleased with the overall appearance of the food. I am used to seeing the breading darker on the porkchop. Once I tasted it any hesitation that I had immediately disappeared. I was cuting the porkchop at first. By the end of the meal I had picked up the porkchop and was eating it with my hands. It was so tender and juicy. The macaroni and cheese was baked and perfect with cheesy goodness. The greens are cooked to perfection. While I was eating, my drink was promptly refilled and I was offered more cornbread. As yummy as it was I had to turn it down. There was so much food. I am surprised that I didn't roll out the door after my meal. I left stuffed and so satisfied. I will definitely be back and have already recommended this restaurant to several friends. This is great food, large portions, attentive service, excellent prices,  & all the comfort I'd expect in a real southern restaurant. A+"}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Service was great!! Our waitress Jerry was great and always checked back with us to see if we needed anything! You cant go wrong with the fried chicken at all! The sweet tea is great as well! We even got one to go! We will def be back! Jayvon was very nice as well and told us a second location was opening on the strip! We will def. Be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Not all that. Requested red snapper they didn't have any. So I had the catfish is was very salty. Service was horrible took 25 minutes just to put our order in but all the waitresses were just standing behind the counter talking :( REALLY! Once our waitresses got to us she was really attentive but it seemed like she was the only working. The guy the greeted us at the door Sat the entire 25 minutes looking at us sit there. didn't ask if we needed anything. Should have just got up and left. Oh by the way I waited another 25 minutes just for the waitresses to come pick up our card to pay for the not so great meal. Only reason I gave it one star is because the sides were good."}
{"text":"Great Food/ Cozy Atmosphere!! 

We we're seated as soon as we walked thru the door. About 2 minutes later, drinks were on the table. My companion and I both ordered the \"muddy waters\" ( half and half or Arnold Palmer).  They were good, not overly sweet or tart.. Since I am a vegetarian, I had the veggie plate ( 3 sides). My selections were mac & cheese, yams and fried okra. Everything was great and came out in no time.. This was my first time trying okra and it is something that I will have again!!! My companion had the Ox tail and she praised it with every bite!!!!! I ordered the banana pudding to go and it was simply amazing! 

Everyone there was friendly from the time I walked in the door until i left. After leaving, I felt like I just had dinner at a relatives.  The service was quick and very efficient. My waitress, Tasha was amazing!!! Yes I intend to visit again!!"}
{"text":"Been here several times and always am greeted with a smile. Love that the servers and hosts go out of their way to make sure you have everything you need and are satisfied with your dining experience. The fried chicken is so good and I'd definitely recommend having it smothered. They even have Kool-Aid. If you're in Vegas and you love soul food and service with a smile M&M is the way to go!"}
{"text":"Walked in and seated right away. Reasonable wait for food to be served, no complaint. Ordered fried chicken,fried catfish,mac n cheese,red beans and rice,fried okra,cabbage and banana pudding. Everything was very tasty, would order every item again. Server was friendly and attentive. This was my first visit and I must say I'm a fan and will make sure to visit this spot whenever I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Had chicken and waffles, one was dropped off plate so a replacement was brought. They are frozen and deep fried. Oil was on plate and when you push with folk more oil came out. The meat loaf was nothing special and at $13 over priced. Would never go back"}
{"text":"I recently went there for the first time ever and the customer service was horrible! No one greeted my boyfriend and I. Everyone looked at us like we didn't belong. I know my soul food, especially coming from down south, I know it should be made with LOVE. The food wasn't even made with love like a real soul food place. I got the BBQ chicken and it just looked like they boiled some chicken and added BBQ sauce on top! The collard greens were good though. Majority of the waitress were rude and didn't check on my table. The yams seemed like it just came out of a can or something. I barely touched it. I was really looking forward to this place because I've been craving soul food ever since I've moved here and I wanted to find a really good place like back at home, but this place is disappointing! I would not ever recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Food is perfect.   We've been here for breakfast and dinner.   Have never had a bad meal.  Muddy water is the perfect mixture. Not to sweet    service is really quick.  If it was closer to my home I'd be there all the damn time"}
{"text":"Service is slow like others complained about   tables were dirty and never cleaned off   good taste as good as the other location but portions are smaller  full order of catfish and chicken is supposed to come with 3 pieces but here its only 2... Drive the extra mile and go to the original spot"}
{"text":"OMG. So glad we found this place. Breakfast was delicious. I had hotlinks, eggs, homemade biscuits. husband had liver and onions, eggs etc. Friendly, helpful staff. Not a fancy place but food is first rate with reasonable prices. Recommend highly!"}
{"text":"The service was horrible. No management at this establishment. The waitresses were literally arguing in plain view of customers. I ordered 2pc. White meat chicken meal with Mac and cheese and mashed w/ gravy. After a 40 min. wait, I got two cold sides and two wings (for $14). I wasn't told that they ran out of chicken breast and I guess they just decided to give me whatever they wanted. The waitress was no where to be found and it took another 10 minutes to get anyone to fix it. So after another 20 minutes she finally brought out 3 more pieces of dark meat and replaced the cold sides with hot food. The chicken was delicious, the greens were delicious - to replace the dry Mac and cheese and a fresh hot mashed and gravy which was ok. When I came in I wanted to experience delicious food followed by great dessert. After almost two hours of this joke of a restaurant service and the mediocre food I just wanted out of there. I won't be going back and I recommend you don't even waste your time here."}
{"text":"Me and my bf absolutely love this place!! Our favorite soul food restaurant... I usually get the bbq chicken which is soooo good and my bf always gets the oxtails"}
{"text":"First time and found it using Yelp. Great food and service! Loved Kool Aid and Mac and Cheese. Red beans and rice was also on point!"}
{"text":"The service here was fantastic.  I've never had someone pay such attention to detail when helping me package my leftovers (brought me new, sealed syrup; a \"to-go\" cup for my drink; extra napkins...).  Of course I had to have the chicken and waffles for my first visit.  The chicken was great: fresh, flakey, & well-seasoned.  The waffles were crisp on the outside, moist on the inside, and tasted of cinnamon.  Yum.  They play fun music, too.  Great place.

Only downside was the unsweetened iced tea had a bit of a coffee flavor to me, and I don't like coffee (but they do have Splenda.  Nice.)."}
{"text":"Great spot for Soul food and comfort food. Prices are very reasonable. Staff was friendly. We went there at least 3 times. Just flip through their photos. Enough said!"}
{"text":"Was in Las Vegas visiting and decided to give this soul food a try. So glad I did! The food was excellent. My friends agreed that the food is awesome! If you're in the area don't miss out. Real soul food serves right!"}
{"text":"So far to me the best southern style place to eat in Las Vegas. It's nothing fancy but it's very satisfying. I got the fried catfish, greens & mac n cheese. The catfish and mac n cheese was awesome! I think the greens were Old Glory! (for people that don't know, you can by greens in a can, and Old Glory is the brand) I wasn't too fond of the greens. My husband had the fried pork chops w/ red beans and rice and greens. Again off the chain. Our other 2 friends one had smothered Chicken and the other had fried Chicken. And we were all very satisfied with our choices. I love the way they serve there drinks, in a jar! lol 
We have been here several times, we have also had there breakfast. It's pretty good too. 

The Corn Cakes are awesome! Definitely something different!"}
{"text":"I wish i didnt have to give a star, I would give minus star's. This place sucks ...I don't see us ever coming back here.  We ordered short ribs.   We waited. ...and waited.   Or waitress said they were running slow, well, we're still waiting.   It's been almost 1 hr.  We ask her how much longer.  She went to check it out.  When she came back,  she said we were going to be mad!  They ran out of short ribs! And not only that, some people that came in after us also ordered short ribs.......and they got (ours) there's.  The chief or th manager couldn't relay that to the waitress!   So we asked to speak with the manager.   So far we've been waiting for 20 min.   We've seen other people talk to the waitress,  an not get there food,  and leave!  I don't see this location lasting very long.   That's too bad, because there's a lot of foot traffic.   I we would have gone to the Charleston restaurant.   Waist Of Our time!  We waited 20+ min for the manager,  when she finally came out, she went and grabbed the phone!   Really,  you would just rather loose customers!   We will never ever come back to this place.  And the manager is the owners sister!   See how family treats your business!"}
{"text":"The waitress recommended the beef liver, with onions and Mac and cheese, black eyed peas and cornbread dressing. The food was delicious and a lot to eat. We had enough left for lunch the next day. My compliments to the servers.."}
{"text":"YUM!!!!! The staff is super nice and very attentive.  I got the fried chicken with red beans and rice and potato salad, oh and a sweet tea. SO FREAKIN GOOD!!!!!! Can't wait to go back for more."}
{"text":"My family and I had heard about this Restaurant and wanted to try it while in Vegas, well let me tell you, we are so sorry we went here, the food was sweet, they forgot to bring out our starter and it took forever,, along with not getting very much food for the price they charge, it was horrible all the way around, I wouldn't recommend this place to a cut cat.. and to be honest with you, I think it all had to do with the fact that my son inlaw was Caucasian.. what a waste of time and money."}
{"text":"This is more like a ZERO star downgrade... Easter Sunday,  1:45 p.m....We came in hungry for some fried chicken... everyone is dressed in their \"Sunday Best\" probably coming from church, and there were a few tables along the wall up front, but we get sat down in the back on a round small lounge table and are the only ones there.

Our waitress, Pearl seemed bothered, no smile, no acknowledgement, kept it short and took our drink orders. Comes back with our sweet teas and takes our order. Fried Chicken, all white meat for wifey,  Fried Chicken, all dark meat for me.

This is not our first visit here...in fact, we recieved awesome service from waitress Shy on our last visit which was during dinner hours and we know that the hot corn cakes come usually after the drinks are dropped off as we wait for our fried chicken which usually takes at least 20 minutes. During our wait, we observe four other tables arrive after us in Pearl's station...
Service with a smile, drinks brought promptly, and corn cakes on every table. We still don't recieve any corn cakes.

\"This is not right!?!?\" Wifey says...Trying not to jump to conclusions, we wait and see that if our entrees come out first, then it's a problem.
6-8 minutes later, our entrees arrive, minus one wing from Wifey's order. Pearl says (her face looking at us and her body already walking away)that the chicken is coming but it takes time...last time I checked,  a breast takes longer than a wing to cook!? We had to ask Pearl for our corn cakes, and reminded her TWO other times that we hadn't recieved Wifey's other piece of chicken, which she insists is coming.

Carefully digging into our food so we don't drop any plates off our small round table, all our sides are cool to room temperature, cornbread dressing was dry, as was the corn cakes, my chicken is barely warm and bland inside having to douse it with a lot of hot sauce,
 wifey's chicken breast is dryer than dry, only eating her wing, and STILL not receiving her third piece!?!? \"You know what?, just remove that third piece from our bill\" wifey says having to flag Pearl down. 

Is it because we were the only non-black people in there?

Is it my board shorts and flip flops I was dressed in, and not my \"Sunday Best\" because I helped baptize over 100 people of ALL possible races at our church since 9am that morning?

All Pearl could say was \"Sorry about that\", which was met with dead silence from us...within a 5 minute span, Pearl comes to our table THREE TIMES with \"can I get you anything else?\" (Chicken never came, drinks were never refilled, why would we want to ask you for anything else but our check?) Pearl received no tip for her uncalled for actions.

Denied an apartment because my Persian
roomate and I weren't white,

Put up in very dirty living conditions(didn't even last a day) because I wasn't a certain religion,

All eyes on me because I was the only brown skinned person in an all white restaurant, 

I've been down this road before...I hope 
 everyone at M&M Soul Food get to read this....SHAME ON YOU AND YOUR DISCRIMINATING WAYS PEARL!!! Makes me sick to see that this kind of nonsense still exists. We won't ever step foot in here again..."}
{"text":"\"Needs A Little More Soul\"

ATMOSPHERE:

M&M's newest location on Las Vegas Blvd. is a bit more open and spacious than their Charleston location, Memorabilia of celebrities and sports legends decorate the walls, and if you wish, there is counter dining as well. Service for the most part was okay, but at times, spotty. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and call it working out the service kinks.


BITES/BEVERAGES:

Fried Chicken is my entree of choice.. This time, I went with a half order($9.99) being that they are new, and we also had plans to go check out a new ice cream spot for dessert that opened earlier that day. My Half order came with a couple of Corn Cakes two pieces of dark meat (I'm a leg and thigh man when it comes to fried chicken) and two sides. I got the Cornbread Dressing and Collard Greens and some Muddy Water to enjoy with my meal. Although on the smallish side, my chicken was pretty good, as was my sides, but again, not as good as the Charleston location.


CLOSING STATEMENTS:

I really do hope the kitchen and service staff can fine tune things because not only are they in a good strip location, they also have potential to serve up some tasty soul food like the flagship location does.  ALOHA!!!

Shaka Meter:  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  3

Chances of returning?  Nah, I'll stick to the other location..."}
{"text":"First time here and I must say food and service is outstanding. My waitress Regina, was fast and courteous and the Snapper is to die for, HIGHLY RECOMMEND"}
{"text":"only giving it 4 stars because my boyfriend looooved it!! and they serve koolaid on the menu and bring it out in a jar w free refills which is all i really loved about it!! was in vegas this pass weekend and wanted to try something different from the usual strip eateries so we googled a soul food restaraunt (out of towners of course) came up wit this spot from the reviews i read i thought i was about 2 be eatin grandmas cooking i ordered pork chop cabbage and mac n cheese pork chop was dry not enough seasoning mac n cheese tasted RE-heated cabbage was bomb tho i will give them that but like i said i was only in love wit the koolaid which i coulda brought 4 10 cents a pack and made on my own boyfriend had the smothered chicked mac n cheese and yams which he was in love with every bite i tasted a bite of each and was not impressed at all i will stick 2 the strip food i know and love because this wasnt up 2 my \"soul food\" standards"}
{"text":"I love M&Ms the food is always flavorful, my only complaint is that when you make an order to go, it is typically smaller or lacking the quality (ie. fatty meat or tiny wings) of when you dine in. the staff is always welcoming and pleasant."}
{"text":"Food is always great, Staff is very pleasant, I love both locations!"}
{"text":"Food is good , But the service is a little on the downside I sat At the bar right in front the cash register and it still took 20 minutes jus for me to get a menu another 20 minutes for my order to get taken food came out in a normal time not once did I get checked on never got a refill on my water when my plate was done it took almost 30 minutes for my check to come , So If u plan on coming here have a lot of time on your hands"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch and I'm so glad I did. As soon as I walked in I smelled the beautiful aroma of fried chicken in the air. I was greeted quickly by a very friendly waitress. I ordered the ox tails. My ordered included corn bread, greens, mac and cheese, yams and ox tails smothered in delectable gravy. The food was hot, fresh and delicious. I definitely will be going back for more. Really good real food."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The wait staff is great, the chef was great!! The food was soooo good! The catfish was fried to perfection! I have nothing bad to say about this restaurant at all! And they have kook-aid on the menu! 6 stars!"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent! We love our grits, and they did not disappoint! Other food that was tasty included peach cobbler, cornbread, red beans/rice and fried chicken! Friendly service too! 

I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"So three of us arrived at 11 waited about 8 minutes to be seated.  Was told breakfast was over but three entree of breakfast was still available. Ordered our food and due to ordering fried foods was told that it was going to be twenty minutes. Fine but a group of 13 came in ordered there food after us and still got there food before we did.  It's now noon and we have had nothing but Juice and cornbread.  Server Stephanie didn't apologize or offer anything.  After hour wait we walked out.  Mine you they also ordered fried food."}
{"text":"This was an interesting experience, and to be honest I'm still deciding on if I would come back or not. It was a normal Thursday night and my friends family was in town. They wanted to do something a little bit different and go off the strip (they were staying at MGM) and a friend of theirs that visited a while back recommended they go to M&Ms soul food. They up and raved about the koolaid and the food and my friends family was convinced that this was the place to be. Let's be honest now....  I am now partial to LoLos Chicken and Waffles koolaid so I took this opinion seriously and kept my head and stomach open. This location is catty corner across the street from the Stratosphere so its an easy place to spot. We pulled up and walked in and the vibe we got is 70s funky diner. The place wasn't necessarily clean and there was no hostess. Unfortunately I have the habit of going to resturants on the nights they are short staffed.  An overworked yet pleasant waitress advised us to come on in and pick a table. Considering the options weren't plenty (more dirty tables than not) and the other tables were occupied it wasn't hard to choose a spot. Now let's fast forward 15 minutes and no menus, no greeting, no drink offers, no acknowledgement.  Once again I think this poor girl was by herself and the other only person working on the floor with her was working hard in another section of the restaurant.  Now let's get on to the actual service and dinner portion of this night.
 
Once we finally got the waitress at our table we ordered three koolaids and three waters with lemon. 10 minutes later she arrived with 3 overly sugared koolaids and two waters no lemon. She told us she'll be back with the water and the lemons. I can tell you now a day later, still no extra water or lemons. Once we finally got her to come back (she was busy I tell you!) we stopped and ordered because who knew when we were going to get this lady again.  We ordered the half plate of fried chicken with mac and cheese and mashed potatoes, full plate of fried pork chops with cabbage, okra, and mac and cheese, and another half plate of smothered pork chops with mac and cheese and yams.  Now clearly on the menu it states when busy meal may take 25-40 minute wait if you order something fried. DUDE they meant it! We were waiting forever. We actually waited so long we all got tired. Thankfully they brought out their cornbread (which looks like pancakes) but those were pretty dull. The butter is the only thing that saved these flapjacks that they called cornbread.
 
Almost an hour later we received our food fresh hot and piping. Few mistakes here and there mashed potatoes came out wrong, the mac and cheese had no flavor, they didn't put any salt or pepper on the fried okra, still haven't gotten my water with lemon lmao. But the porkchops were nicely flavored, the potatoes were good, and the greens were salted perfectly. It was definitely disappointing only because we waited so long and still didn't have all of order and when we did ask for another mashed potatoes she actually finished her food by the time they brought it to her. 20 minutes later. All in all we spent about 2 and  1/2 hours  here waiting for service, waiting for food, hell just waiting. Would I go back? Idk. It's decent food nothing spectacular, but just thinking about the wait....NAAAAH..."}
{"text":"Great awesome food! Been there 6 times and the food never changes it's flavor. You get more than enough. Thank you Regina for your hospitality and service. In spite of the lunch crowd. You did well in getting our food out in a timely manner. Kuudoos to the chef also!"}
{"text":"When we first arrived there was a 30-45 minute wait. No greeting or direction. However, the other guest waiting told me put your name on a notebook and wait. Crazy how here was a wait and no one was in the restaurant. Seemed to be short staffed and ended up waiting over an hour to be seated. I was told they had people who called in. Only 2 waitresses available. Once seated the waitress was very nice and helpful. She was great. The food wasn't worth the wait. Chicken wasn't seasoned. Greens had no flavor. I had to season it myself. Yam too sweet. Mac and cheese was okay. Cabbage needed some help. Corn bread was burnt. I wouldn't go back"}
{"text":"Revisited this place on a Saturday morning. The service was totally different than during the week. We were seated immediately, it wasn't crowded. We ordered our food in a timely manner  but it was almost 45 minutes before we received it and even then some of it was cold. We had to send it back. We didn't have any salt and pepper on our table, we requested it but eventually had to go to a table to get it ourselves.  When everything finally arrived, hot, it was good but the service and the wait took away from giving it rave reviews. I'll stick to going here during the week."}
{"text":"Went to this place for Sunday lunch with my man and it definitely leaves a lot to be desired. The serving staff is a delight however that does not compensate for the tasteless soul food. I had dark meat fried chicken with greens and macaroni & cheese... My other half had smothered chicken, black eyed peas and greens. Why we both choose those dreadful greens, I don't know. The chicken was old, the mac was something out of a box and the greens... Well they tasted like someone picked them out of a garden and threw them in salt water. We both had this muddy water drink... watered down country time lemonade and generic iced tea. 
On the bright side, the staff was very friendly and helpful. So if I was looking to make friends, I guess I would revisit but I wouldn't go back if I was hungry."}
{"text":"Mmm Mmm good...

Im from Los Angeles and we have a few good soul food restaurants to choose from, when i moved here I hadn't had such great luck finding a good one until I went here.

Omg DELICIOUS the food is so so so good.

I ordered the BBQ spareribs with yams and cornbread dressing as my sides, the meat was falling off the bone and was so tender and the BBQ sauce was of the chain, the yams were so sweet and delicious and the cornbread dressing well lets just say i could have had seconds and thirds of it. My plate was completely empty by the end of the meal and I still had room for banana pudding which was homemade just like everything else. 

The waitress was very friendly and on point with my refills of their delicious sweet tea.

I cant wait to return here again by far one of my favorite places to eat and it was worth every penny."}
{"text":"Ordered Oxtail with two sides, Collared Greens and Fried Okra. The oxtail and okra were salty. 

The waitress, Frances was very sweet, she asked me if I wanted something else and I asked for smothered pork chops, yams and rice and beans. 

The yams we're great but the pork chop was salty and the rice and beans was okay. 

This place has the best corn bread I've ever had. I'm from Chicago and I've had some great soul food, unfortunately, other than the corn bread, yams and the service by Frances, the M & M's Soul Food in Las Vegas was a big disappointment."}
{"text":"Large portions!
Friendly  and fast service!
Soul food done right!
Ghetto fabulous but in a good way!
You will want to take a nap when you're done!
Your belly will be \"fat happy!\""}
{"text":"We are on vacation from Texas and wanted to try something off the strip and home cooked style so we found this place on Charleston and Lanesha or Lanessa (our server - I am sorry i cant remember her exact name) but she was awesome at taking care of our meals and drinks. She was always checking on us and making sure we had everything we needed. And the food was so good! We had smothered fried chicken, smothered  stuffing, baked chicken etc, all of our plates we very good! Thank you for the pleasant lunch and awesome service! Also, I have to add, we first stopped at the  S Las Vegas Blvd location and the service there was awful so we left and almost didn't even try the Charleston location but I am glad we did, everyone there was so nice and the service and food was awesome!"}
{"text":"The chicken and waffles were on point! Not one compliant about the food (I ate a number of side dishes). I do not recommend the desserts, any of them, i went with a group of six and we all have southern roots and although the food is great.... the drinks and desserts are not. You should definitely try the food though its good!"}
{"text":"This place has great food and service. Worth stopping in for lunch. Catfish was very tasty and the cornbread is warm sweet and soft - so good!"}
{"text":"As soon as we stepped in the hosts & servers are greeting us. Even as we're making our way to our seats the cooks are saying hi, lol very friendly staff for starters. 

I got the meatloaf which was delishhh literally melted in my mouth a side of mac & cheese, fried okra (first time eating okra very simple but good) & collard greens. The corn bread was in little pancakes so cute! Never seen corn bread like that but of course yummy! 

I had a bite of my friends fried catfish (never had it like that) will definitely get my own plate next time. 

I recommend to order a bigger portion than what you would usually get."}
{"text":"Visit #2 (2 days in a row) Imagine a bulldog protecting a delicious large bone. This is how I feel about the catfish. Come near mine and you will get bit!"}
{"text":"Good stuff very tasty smotherd chicken, red beans and rice, yams, , and cornbread  cakes, HOWEVER, the mac & cheese was GARB! Mac and cheese lacked seasoning insufficient  cheese AND  the noodles were overcooked might as well not have been included. 

Can't  for the Service it was very good!"}
{"text":"Today I was willing to spend $25 or so on fried chicken for a late lunch.  I walked in the restaurant had a decent amount of people eating, maybe 60% full.  I ended up waiting 5 min to be seated at the counter, when they said to me we'll be woth you in a second sir (which was great), but they could of said do you want to sit at the counter to begin with.  Then the real wait began.  After a minute, I figured out what I wanted, I put the menu to the side and waited.  After a minute or two I picked up my phone and started surfing social media.  13 minutes later I got up and left...no glass of water, no place setting, napkin, what would you like to eat...nada even though I'm sitting at the counter.  Chick fil A got my money today...thanks for saving me $15 on my lunch expense."}
{"text":"After visiting here many times they've had another location and they just aren't the same restaurant and now are one star that I will not return to I should just avoiding this place and going someplace like Lolas or elsewhere Cheers!"}
{"text":"This is a very good restaurant, but I don't think it is as good as the original. Our first visit the manager was rude to us and it was very apparent that this wasn't the original. The nephew of the owner was bussing tables saw that we were upset and put us in touch  with his uncle that evening. 

The owner offered to purchase us a meal on out next visit and promised to fix the issues. I never did take the owner up on the offer of a free dinner but we have been back to this location a few times and the restaurant has totally changed. I haven't seen the not so great of waitress nor the rude manager but have been very happy with every thing they have done. It just isn't the original though."}
{"text":"Servicio un poco lento, aunque el pollo esta muy bueno así como los huevos y los waffles. Bien ubicado el restaurant."}
{"text":"I had the gumbo and it was great the first time I actually tried gumbo it had shrimp chicken sausage and crab!!! Yum But I must say the pancake cornbread now that was delicious!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. When ever I am in Vegas, and want veggies with a good meat, this is the place. Keep up the work and service. The staff is so wonderful!"}
{"text":"Visiting from the Midwest. Would've thought I was in the south. Very good customer service and the food was awesome.  Had oxtails, greens, black eyed peas. Great experience. Probably best to avoid the weekend, not a large place"}
{"text":"I am visiting from Ohio and this place was suggested by my family. My experience and this location was all bad. Wait to be seated wAs long, almost as long as the wait to get our order (over an hour) I went basic chicken and mashed potatoes and was very disappointed. Bi had to send the potatoes back for cabbage which they put sugar in . the red beans and rice were so bland. Then to top it all off, they kept my boyfriends credit card at the register and we had to go back after leaving to get it . We later went to the other location where everything was % better."}
{"text":"M & M Soul Food Cafe is a hit or miss restaurant.  Every time I go there, I have to send my food back because it is not done right.  The chicken wings are always dry because they over cook them.  However, when they re-do them, they are usually pretty decent.  I should not have to go through this to get decent food.  I am burnt out and will not go back.  The M & M's in California is not any better!"}
{"text":"We had a really good experience at this particular M&M's. I think that it is better than the one on Charleston. The food was really good and the service was exceptional. Our server Jerria was on point. She was very attentive and competent at her job, and very mindful of our needs. She always addressed us with her beautiful smile. I will definitely eat at this location again in the near future."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Not only the food but the service was outstanding. We had a large group and they allowed us to combine tables. We ordered a ton of food and it came out fast. The fried chicken, fried catfish, gumbo & rice were all amazing. He ordered a ton of sides as well. The best part was the peach cobbler wasn't quite ready yet but the waitress was able to get us 6 servings of it right as it came out and it was amazing. Definitely will be returning again."}
{"text":"Simply amazing soul food and great staff that make you feel right at home. And the price is right too!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service! Was really excited to try this place while visiting Vegas. I got a rewards coupon that was buy one get one meal free type of deal. Upon arriving, I walked up to the counter and one of the waitresses told me to have a seat in the diner chairs and someone would take my order. I let her know right away I had a coupon and she said ok and took it from me. My husband and I waited about 5 minutes before our order was taken, along with other people beside us. We waited about 10 minutes after ordering and the people beside us received their food. No big deal... after waiting another 10 minutes, a hispanic/white looking waitress (didn't get her name) came up to me and said I couldn't use the coupon because I had already used it in a VERY rude and accusatory/condescending tone. She kept saying I used it on the 24th of March and it was barely the 22nd the day we were there. When I brought it to her attention she just said \"well you already used it\" (Which I never did since it was my first time ever going). I asked to speak to a manager and she said \"no we don't have one\". She kept talking to me beyond rude like she owned the place or something. Then she asked if we still wanted to place the order. After waiting around 25-30 minutes she still had not place our order!! Clearly it seemed like she had it out for us or something. I've never been treated so rude in my life. My husband and I decided to just get up and leave. I will not support any business that treats people in such a manner. Unfortunately, we didn't get to try the food and never will because of this experience. Just an FYI, beware if you use promotional coupons because they will give you the run around."}
{"text":"I'm going to give the place on Charleston 5 big ones! The service, the food and the wait staff was superb!!! Definitely on our \"go to\" list when we return. Can't say enough about this place. Portions were large enough not to finish at one sitting and we love leftovers. We felt welcome from jump and the wait staff was all over service. The food was served hot and was definitely \"eye candy\"."}

Again, all were outstanding.!! And, oh yes-peach cobbler."}
{"text":"Found this place in Fodor's Las Vegas Travel Guide... and it's in there for a reason.  Food is exactly what you'd expect it to be.  Delicious soul food -- chicken, mac & cheese, greens, cornbread.  Down-to-earth crowd.  Not much on atmosphere, but the price and service were terrific."}
{"text":"Eh...soso and ok at best. Outdated kitchen area. One cook on duty and slow response from the server all add up to average experience at best. The food could have been warmer. Part of the problem is a combination of timing by the cook when he prepares the food and the server. The corn bread pancakes were greasy and cold. Our table of 4 got our food in increments...not all at once. My meal was brought out with vegetables first and the pork chops 5 minutes later. For better service they need to learn how to coordinate the meals so that everyone in our 4 person group gets their food at the same time...not 10 minutes apart."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a very good soul food restaurant, we would highly recommend M & M Soul food.

Every time we are in the Las Vegas area we try to make it to this restaurant it is an easy place to get to and understandably it is a very good restaurant. The cooks definitely have learned from their parents grandparents and other culinary personnel how to serve a great meal. I may be a little jaded, I have never really been to the southern states and had a traditional home cook southern meal, but I definitely have had good meals throughout my travels and this is definitely one of them.

Their menu is well made, it's not very extensive and you have a lot of options that you can make with the size of the menu, I am more of a chicken and waffles type person with some Collie greens and some sweet potatoes yummy.  When you order your meal you definitely can smell the home cooking promenading throughout the restaurant. The food is hot and fresh the new quality is terrific and the chicken is to die for.

If you happen to be in the area you can always give this a try and I look forward to seeing your review on here as well."}
{"text":"Just what I needed for a $15 or less lunch.  Service was great, too.  Liver & onions with the house gravy was just what I needed for a chilly day in Vegas.  Muddy water, fried okra and cornbread stuffing made for a great alternative to 'big-house' diners.  Close to the Westgate Las Vegas Casino and Resort (walking distance to walk off my meal, keeping me honest, people).  Good service with a smile!  Dig in!"}
{"text":"I ate here today for the first time. We ordered the chicken and waffles, catfish dinner, and fried chicken dinner. Everything was hot and had great flavor. Reminded me of Sunday dinner as a little girl."}
{"text":"This review is for the M&M on the strip, A few of us where visiting from out of town, a friend recommended the food. As we got there the wait time was long,(30 minutes) but we could not understand why, because there was so many open tables, we noticed three waitress working but no organization. We where finally got  seated waited another 15 minutes, had 2 keep asking is someone going 2 take our order? The we noticed another group that came in after we did was seated, & there order was being taken first. Buy the time the waitress that took the other guests order first came over to use, we was asking her questions about it. She instinctively got an attitude, we got up and left. Never ordered, I do not need 2 spend my money in an place that does not no how handle a guess.  If this business wants 2 stay in business, they need some serious help in management & staffing, Good luck if you still want 2 try this place"}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I've had legit soul food. This place was seriously off the hook."}
{"text":"The service was terrible if you get Ebony run and run fast!!! She is a hood dirty with a bad attitude. Food was good after the hour and half wait."}
{"text":"I must say I was higly dissapointed in the meal that I ate here. I had the oxtail meal with collard greens, cornbread and yams. I think the only thing that was good out of the entire meal were the yams. I am originally from the South so I was expecting this meal to be off the chain since I have seen so many good reviews. I must say that the young lady that served me was nice. Other than tha and the yams that was it. I was told that there is another cafe which is the original one and they are 5 times better."}
{"text":"This place is to good! Went in expecting  to be okay with the food and left a loyal customer. Although I don't live in LV I will make this place a must have on every single trip. Great, homemade food items and friendly staff. I had the half smothered chicken and my husband had the meatloaf. Both were delicious and worth the wait! Must try while in town!"}
{"text":"Food is good but the customer service needs to step it up. Some are rude look at u as if u have 3 eyes"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, yes! M & M has the best friend chicken I have ever had!!! The batter not too thick and very well seasoned and the inside was really moist even if I ordered white meat. My sides were mac n cheese and fried okra. Mac n cheese was delish and fried okra was pretty standard. This place is a must try for anyone, I was in the area with a hungry stomach and thought \"hey why not try it out?\" since it has been on my list for ages now. My server Jania (sp?) was super nice and she referred to me as baby (lol), I thought it was cute and made her very hospitable. I'm sure everyone knows it's in a sketchy shopping center on Charleston & Valley View, but as I parked and walked to the entrance it felt even worse. Oh well, take the risk because its worth it! There is also a few security with guns inside the restaurant. The outside is pretty dead, but inside you'll see a restaurant full of people. You will also see a mixture of patrons eating, which is comforting to know they give their love to everyone!"}
{"text":"I don't know what happen, but this place has gone down with its customer service. 

Our party walked in the door and was not greeted even though a waitress was standing less than five feet away. No \"good morning\" or \"I'll be right with you\". Had coffee and never got asked if we wanted a refill. Food took way too long to come out. Staff was standing around socializing with each other. Other people walked in and waited several minutes to be acknowledged and to be seat. One party walked out and I don't blame them. 

Will not be returning here."}
{"text":"We had family visiting from Virginia and my mother in law knows true southern cooking. Big mistake. They ordered catfish and the Mac and cheese was so dry and the plates came out and I was embarrassed. My mother in law could have gone into kitchen and gave a few lessons.
Not impressed at all. Time to get food took awhile and atmosphere was less than impressive.
We ended up having a real soul food throw down at our home and it was 10x's better. First and last visit."}
{"text":"We've never been here before even though we've known about this place forever and been talking about coming here for a while. 
When we arrived, the atmosphere was really friendly and boisterous. We were seated quickly, and we were near one of the TVs so we could watch the basketball game (which was a little weird because the TVs weren't synced and the speaker next to us was synced for the other TV)
Our server Tonisha was super, super friendly and helpful. She helped me steer clear of all the onions (some servers at other restaurants won't check to see if a food has a particular ingredient because they decide it's only a preference of mine instead of an actual allergy or they seem to think their tip will decrease if they tell me I can't have the food I want- FAIL) and she kept our drinks full most of the time (Kool-Aid  and bf got muddy water- both were good).
They brought out these absolutely yummy cornbread hotcakes first, which was a really nice touch. 
We ordered catfish (which was good, my bf said the tartar sauce was pretty cheap though so maybe bring your own little bottle) and 6 sides- all of which were pretty good. Word to the wise- if you get the fried okra, eat it before it gets cold.  I enjoyed the mac & cheese. I was too full to really give the rice & beans a fair shot. String beans with little potatoes were fun. Bf liked the black eyed beans. The peach cobbler for dessert was nice. However, if you have a sweet tooth like me, the YAMS are DELICIOUS!! I'm thinking next time I just might order multiple sides of yams"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. The customer service is terrible, the tables were dirty, it took 15 minutes to get the drinks we ordered and to top that 30 minutes after we ordered we were told they ran out of many of the items earlier in the day. Really, it took 30 minutes to realize that. 

Don't do it. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Food was substandard, service was the same. I had really high hopes for this place but unfortunately I was let down."}
{"text":"well we went there today and it was actually packed because of the football game, but the service was still and courteous. We started of with these cornbread cakes which very good. It did take some time for the food to come out but I figured it was because of all the people. Being a southern Belle I was going to be a critic on the good because of being from Mississippi. It was quite good. What really surprised me the most was the diplomatic solution on the take next to us. From what I gathered was that the food was taking way to long and when it came out some of the order was wrong. The server have her the plate with some of the wrong side dishes and got her the correct one at no charge. So instead of 3 sides she got 5. Also, desserts was on the house for the table. From working in the restaurant industry she did what she needed to make the customers happy. I can't wait to go back to try a new dish the next time"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and it was quite busy. I sat at the counter since I was alone and didn't much time. The staff was pretty friendly and helpful. I ordered smothered pork chops and is was ummm ok... Gravy was flavorful but you can tell they just dump the gravy on the pork chops without any simmering. And the pork chop itself was cheap and thin, not what I was used to. Others have said good things about this place so I will give another try but a different dish."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant  when we were in Vegas that Memorial  weekn. The food was great but, the service  was horrible.  One of the waitress kept passing us not asking if we have been helped or anything or even took our drink order . But, when we finally flagged her dwn she asks if we need anything??? Uh duh!!! We are not sitting here for our health. I can't believe   the service was so bad we waited for to long.  That will be the last time I ever go there,even though food  was yummmy. The service ruined  everything!!!
P.s  why do u hv wheat waffles??? they looked liked ego waffles are u serious smh"}
{"text":"My fiance and I have been here twice now and had the same experience both times. We started off with a very attentive waitress who was quick to bring us our drinks and pancakes. Shortly after, both times, our waitress seems to disappear. (That isn't to say they are rude, they were very sweet, they just never came and checked on us again.) The wait time between ordering and actually getting out food wasn't too bad - about 15 or 20 minutes - but during that time we did not see our waitress once. The food itself is very good! Both times I have ordered the fried catfish and my fiance has ordered some type of chicken. We were really impressed both times. I do plan on returning to this location, although hopefully the waitresses will be more attentive the next time!"}
{"text":"Originally went in for the $5 lunch special only to find out it's one piece of chicken, red beans and potato salad. So I ordered fish. Too expensive with an \"ok\" value. $9.99 for one piece of fish and two sides?!?! My sweet tea remained empty until I asked for the check the waitress asked if I wanted a refill. Will not return"}
{"text":"Wow! From the fried chicken, to the sides everything is homemade deliciousness, those corn meal flap jacks are awesome and don't leave with out some banana pudding.  We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I absolutely love home style southern cooking and M&M Soul Food never falls short.  From the authentic genuine traditional old school Kool-Aid to Chicken and Waffles this place leaves you wanting more of what momma used to feed you as a kid.

On this visit I ordered pork chops, Mac and Cheese, and Green Beans.  The pork chops reminded me of how my mom used to batter them and get that salty taste jerky chew.  I got the half portion for $9.99, WOW!  The Mac and cheese was made with real authentic cheese handmade, the real deal.  Not that microwavable shit you get at Von's or Smith's.  The green beans had been cooked to perfection to melt in your mouth with every bite.

I forgot to mention our server and her co-workers were very delightful to deal with...I usually never base my reviews on that, but definitely icing on the cake! Very attentive, automatic refills, and offered us dessert.  My wife took home Peach Cobbler, yum!  I wish Las Vegas had more of these type of restaurants or at least one closer to my house, because I would go everyday!"}
{"text":"We have eaten in this resturant as well as taken food out. My wife absolutely loves the Sweet Potato Pie to the point that 3 or 4 times a year I have to go and get her a whole pie. This visit was one of those times and for the first time the pie wasnt good at all not smooth and the taste is very off after one bite it was thrown away. Very Disappointing not what we expected."}
{"text":"not the first time i've been here, was great again.  oxtail, fired chicken, ribs, and ordered the pork chops but the waitress forgot, but just as well cause we had more than enough food will all the sides.  will be back again."}
{"text":"The food was great and the service just as good. The cleanliness however wasn't the greatest but not bad enough to not eat here."}
{"text":"2.5 stars. Food was just ok. Hubby had the fried chick and I had the fried chick smothered. Again just ok nothing to write home about. Our server was really nice and on point though."}
{"text":"The food was amazing!! Good portions and very tasty. Fun location too downtown for lots of people watching. 
Like this location the best. Was told there would be a wait for food but ours came out very fast with no problem. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Outstanding. Prompt service. Fast food 
Real potatoes
Real cheese in the Mac 
Real hand cut greens!!!"}
{"text":"\"Salads are too healthy for us.\" This was stated to another party at M&M when they inquired over any leafy salads they might offer. This is certainly not food that should be eaten every day (see health rates for states like Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana as reference), but it sure is a treat for every now and then. 

Absolutely affordable, definitely delicious, and the wait staff -- at least when we visited (Thursday night; waitress: Toni) was wonderful. I have a feeling that they are usually wonderful.

The cornbread pancakes are incredible. I ordered pork chops, smothered, and sides of rice/ beans, yams, and fried okra. Dessert: sweet potato pie. All delicious, and brought very fast to our table. Normally, I do not consume even a fraction of the daily recommended amount of sodium or fat, so eating this much salt/lipids was not really a concern to me (I gained .2 pounds in morning weigh ins after eating here). 

I definitely need to return for some chicken and waffles and for the banana pudding. Next time I will probably inquire over purchasing some cornbread pancakes to take home. - E"}
{"text":"This place is really nice and clean. That's the first thing I look at when going out to eat. If it's dusty and dirty I will politely exit and do my Yelp review  we were immediately greeted by almost all of the staff which was nice. Our waitress was so nice and welcoming, she never left us unattended. The wait for the food was a little long however the drinks are free refills and so is the cornbread a plus. I will definitely be back when I visit Vegas again. The owner actually came in and came around to all the tables and engaged in conversation which was really welcoming."}
{"text":"This was my second time here and I ordered the same thing cuz last time it was so good. But this time the chicken and waffles was not everything I was hoping for. The waffles were soft and soggy the chicken was good but I wanted a complete meal. The best part of my meal was the kool-aid.  I will most likely give them another shot but definitely staying away from the waffles"}
{"text":"The food is great.... I will come back to this spot each and every time I come to Vegas.... I had the waffles and chicken.. The chicken was seasoned well and the and was fried perfectly the waffles was light and fluffy.... Great service and music... This place is a must.... You get a lot of food for the price and prices are much reasonable than the IHOP across the street....
Shigirl"}
{"text":"I had to try this out myself after reading all the positive reviews about how good the food here is.  I ordered the oxtail and fried chicken with their famous gravy on the side to go.  I was surprised how big the orders were.  The price is definitely reasonable for the portion it comes in.  Now for the food, it was absolutely delicious! The oxtail was so tender and it's sauce was so flavorful.  The chicken was mediocre.  It just tasted ordinary. But, it could be due to it sitting in the to go box for half an hour. So, I wouldn't judge it too harshly since food tastes a lot better fresh out the stove.  My daughter loved the mac and cheese it came with :) I would definitely come back to this place again. The owners and cashier were super friendly as well which makes this place A++++!"}
{"text":"Amazing comfort food! Much better than our hotel would have offered. Servers were nice and pleasant. Food delivery was quick which helps when on a schedule.Give thus place a try, you will not be dissatisfied !"}
{"text":"I desperately want to love this place but I don't.  It's expensive and kinda bland.  The space is a little on the nasty side too.  The red kool-aid and the corncake pancakes are really good."}
{"text":"Best fried catfish evvveeerr!!!"}
{"text":"Avoid!!! My company recently ordered from here for a work event, and made sure to get vegetarian sides for the non-meat-eaters in the group. After delivery was made (and we had already paid), someone called to confirm that the vegetable sides were actually vegetarian -- and was told that \"all our vegetables are cooked with turkey.\" WTAF? Who does that? This is incredibly terrible customer service, and made all of us wonder what other weird ingredients they weren't disclosing. Screenshot attached to show that nowhere on the menu was this disclosed. Definitely stay away if you have allergies or dietary restrictions, or just plain don't want weird ingredients thrown into your dishes that you didn't order!"}
{"text":"This was the best soul food I've had in a long time and it was a short walk from my hotel. My server has pretty, I wish I caught her name but she had purple lip stick on. I am throughly impressed with the service I received! #BlackExcellence"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday around noon & were instantly seated.  The dining area was clean, they were playing a mix of soul & R&B music, the TVs were playing a basketball game. The service was quick, friendly, & all wore cute appropriate uniforms. 

My grandpa ordered the half fried catfish (9.99) w/ yams and collards.  He is 80 and doesn't eat much, but cleaned his plate today.  I got the half fried chicken (9.99) w/ fried okra and macaroni and cheese.  The fried chicken was some of the best that I have ever eaten - I grew up working in a fried chicken restaurant in south Georgia.

I will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Went to new location on Sahara Blvd couldn't find location on Yelp. I understand it was their first day opening but I shouldn't have to wait 40 mins for some  pork chops and shrimp and grits. The sides were cold... I expected to devour this food and it was weak. The pork chops was hard to cut so they overcooked it. I live in Los Angeles and the M&Ms have not made it... The main waitress Vee was good and others just didn't know what to do because they seen we were curious why our food was taking so long... When I come back to Vegas I'll check and see if the 2nd location is still there because I highly believe it won't be. You gotta do better M&Ms staff I don't care if it was your first day this your second location. Business is business customers are most of the time right."}
{"text":"M&M Soul Food is Mississippi cooking at its best. It is located in a little strip mall and not easy to see. Ask the front desk at your hotel and they will know this place. 
It appears there is usually a wait, it is a small place, but it is worth it. Really, and I hate waiting.
The service is great and the place cute and very clean. Parking is in their lot.
The food is the best. They have breakfast, lunch and dinner. All are great. They have some of the best macaroni and cheese and fried fish you will have anywhere in Nevada.
They have corn bread rolls and the best beans. I have been told the liver and onions is great, I don't care for liver, but I trust the person that told me.
If you have a chance get the chicken and waffles.
It is just wonderful. Have fun."}
{"text":"Came here with friends was craving some fried chicken. Love the gravy.  Will recommend to friends who are visiting in town."}
{"text":"Can't believe I just had liver and onions for breakfast.  But OMG! Fantastic.  The chicken and waffles are huge wings.   One of the little gems off the beaten path."}
{"text":"Catfish was bomb AF!! Greens were good, mac n cheese, ehh your better off with the boxed Kraft. It seems like they don't have any manager/management. Things were a bit disorganized. One person in our party ordered fried green tomatoes and he ate his whole meal, but the tomatoes never made it to the table. Not sure if they're short staffed on the cook or what. But bottom line, that catfish is worth the wait. Everything else, you can pretty much get elsewhere and it'll be more flavorful."}
{"text":"How can you not give 5 starts when you jamming to Barry White at 8:30am having amazing pork chops and eggs for breakfast..I love this place!"}
{"text":"First of all, the restaurant closes at 8 PM, not 9 as listed everywhere on the internet.  So, if you do not want to feel rushed while eating or told that \"it takes 25 minutes to fry chicken, so don't ask\" do not walk in at 7:30 as we did without knowing the true closing time.  We were looking for an authentic soul food restaurant and an off the strip experience but this was not it.

After being told what not to order, I opted for the baked chicken and two sides.  I've never gone to a restaurant where the meat comes out first, at least 10 minutes before the accompanying sides - oops, only one side was brought out, the other was being cooked.  At that point I told the waitress to keep the second side, by the time it would have arrived, the other food would have been finished.  The baked chicken was just OK - gravy was too peppery but then again to each his own.  Overall, the chicken was just ok nothing to run home and tell anyone about.  The one side I did get - greens were good.

My husband had pork chops and three sides - greens, cabbage & rice/gravy.  He stated the pork chops and rice gravy were salty the veggies were good.

Maybe this was not their best night but first impressions are lasting impressions.  The restaurant came highly recommended by locals who've never eaten in similar restaurants around the country.  I had so much hope but have no plans to return."}
{"text":"Loved the food!! Ordered the porkchop with potatoes and eggs. Was just like something out of your mama's kitchen. I enjoyed everything,  even the toast. Will definitely br back on my next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Just arrive to Las Vegas and we always stop here even before checking in to our hotel , food always delicious waitress very attentive a must when coming to Vegas , the chicken and waffles are awesome , my husband said chicken is made out of super chickens big pieces very recommended"}
{"text":"Got here around 5:45... here it is 6:46.... and WE STILL HAVENT RECEIVED OUR ORDER!! Our \"server\" screwed up our whole order and it had to be re made.... my kids left to go get food because they were sick of waiting. I will NEVER come back to this unorganized place! ZERO STARS!!"}
{"text":"I would give no star if I could. This is the WORST place I have ever been to. When I first arrived I was greeted and placed on the waitlist. After I was seated, I waited 15 minutes before my drink order was taken. It took another 15-20min to get my food order. After waiting 40+ min for my food I finally had enough and offered to pay for my drinks. They kindly (sarcasm) gave them to me on the house. I should also say, I am a lighter skinned Mexican and felt I was not treated the same as the other customers. There was a family next to me who got in after and were treated like a customer. I definitely do NOT recommend this place. If you want a place that treats you like a customer and human being try the Gritz Cafe, they're service is superb and food is even better. They do get wait times but that is food worth waiting for."}
{"text":"Their food is absolutely fantastic, it fills a need for melt in your mouth, roll your eyes back in your skull soul food. The ambience is super casual and the service was fantastic."}
{"text":"The food was really good but they need more staff. They had two servers and they had way to much to do between the two of them covering the whole place. 
Might be back due to the food being good but the service needs work."}
{"text":"Great food and service here at traditional soul food. Beautiful atmosphere and staff. Bought so much food and Lyft back to the hotel with meals for days."}
{"text":"Thank the food gods that this place is a two minute walk from my office, because I am in love with the food. So far my experience only includes the catfish.. but it is AMAZING! So much flavor. I order the half order, which comes with two sides and one long piece of catfish. The large order includes three sides. For my sides, I always get the fried okra and Mac and cheese. I would say the flavor with the sides is just as good. Service is always fast and friendly! It always takes about ten mins to make. I'll have to come back and try the other stuff, no wonder this place has been here a while! Parking lot looks pretty small, lunch time it's never busy but I'm curious how it is during dinner time"}
{"text":"Fabulous food with fantastic service. 

Make your way to the ole downtown Vegas area near the SLS Casino and the Stratosphere Casino and you will come across a little shopping district and a slew of wedding chapels. Right before all the soon-to-be-divorced-shops, you'll find M&M Soul Food Cafe across from an iHop. Offering an interesting choice of breakfast items that you find find from your standard restaurant, M&M blends cultural favorites to bring you unique and mouthwatering menu items you don't often come across at a great low price.
 
Definitely a great place to stop in for early for breakfast, brunch, or lunch and keeps you on a budget that can easily feed two people for under $20. Opted for a cheese omelette with a few strips of bacon and a fresh and buttery biscuit washed down with fresh orange juice poured into a mason jar glass. Cheese was dripping off the top of them omelette and oozing out the middle, just the way I like it and the bacon found it's way onto those buttery biscuit with precision accuracy into my pie hole. Highly recommended for those seeking a cheaper breakfast from all the casino and resort options with a quiet atmosphere and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I loved my first experience here.

Upon entering with my sister and one year old niece we sat where ever we pleased.

I've driven by many many many times, but the inside was a lot nicer than I expected. I think the recently renovated. 

I hate eating with my niece because she's a baby and causes a scene. Anyone who loves food knows that eating is an experience and I hate to ruin other people's experience with a toddler causing a raucous.

The staff here won her over and had her smiling, laughing, and behaving. Even the other customers were laughing at her. She doesn't do we'll with strangers so this put me at ease. In return my opinion of the staff is very high. We had help from about five people. She also dropped about three forks that the staff replaced every time with a smile. 

That little part aside..

I CAME FOR THE FRIED CHICKEN! 

I love fried chicken and I had really high hopes after being disappointed by Meat and three just the night before.

You could choose a full or half portion. Full was 3 pieces of chicken with three sides for $15 half was 3 pieces and 2 sides for $9.99

I had Mac and cheese, collard greens, and mashed potatoes.

Before my fried chicken came out they serve a corn bread pancake with butter. I could eat a million of these. They were yummy.

For a drink I had red kook aid !

The brought all the food at once.

The fried chicken was fresh, cooked perfect, but I hate to say nothing special. It was very good fried chicken, but not what I hoped for southern fried chicken to taste like. I don't knock the chicken. I just had very high expectations.

It was my first time trying collard greens and I wasn't a fan.

Their Mac and cheese was special though. Next time I'd order three portions of it. YUMM. I DROOL. It's that good.

The mashed potatoes were just average. They honestly tasted boxed and the gravy wasn't particularly good either.

The kook aid was very good but maybe a tad too sweet. It was $2.50 and we didn't get a refill.

For dessert I had peach cobbler. It was very good but a bit watery. I wish their was more dough and peach rather than watery sauce.

Overall I really loved this place.

It may not sound like it from the review, but the food, staff, and overall experience was awesome. 

Next time I'm trying different sides and ill be having my fried chicken smothered."}
{"text":"Bookmarked for awhile and they were the only soul food option open today. So we take the 20min ride to check them out for lunch at about 12/1230. We arrive and it's no line or wait. A few tables were filled, but the waitress advised us to sit anywhere. 

We ordered a full fried chicken dinner it came with 3 sides he got mac & cheese, yams, & greens. Add on catfish 2pc. My order was a half smothered pork chop, 1 fried chicken thigh it came w/2 sides. I got greens & yams. We expected a 20 min wait per other reviews due to ordering fried chicken. The food came out quickly in about 10mins. Everything was hot except his sides were wrong & cold. They replaced the wrong side. Far as the taste goes the chicken thigh was flavorless. The wings were good he said. I didn't like the yams. Greens were ok, but not hot. He said mac & cheese was bland. Fish was good, I think it's swai tho. 

Killer of the meal, the waitress called the cook over to tell him our sides were cold, he screamed over the restaurant they couldn't be. He comes over and said \"them hoes leave the food in the window & it gets cold\" REALLY DUDE??? This is totally unacceptable to say to people you don't know and disrespectful with a female being present. He saw that we didn't engage in laughter and tried to laugh it off with excuse my language. I have never in 34yrs experienced a cook, server, waitress, cashier, owner, or manager call their employees \"hoes\". So ummmmmmm yeah I'll never go back. 

2 stars for the pleasant waitress. Good luck ladies I hope that's not the owner because he doesn't think much of yall."}
{"text":"M&M is my favorite spot for soul food in Las Vegas.  I knew after my first visit that I will be back again and again and again.  The service is great and if there's a wait, it usually doesn't take too long for us to be seated.  My favorite dish at M&M is their smothered baked chicken.  This dish is hooked up with big pieces of perfectly baked chicken smothered with gravy.  I'll usually get a full order and it comes with 3 sides.  My sides is pretty much the same every time...cornbread dressing, the yams, and red bean & rice.  My entire meal is big enough to feed two people. But it's so good that I will finish the entire meal on my own.  Most of the Yelpers I know rave about their chicken & waffles.  The chicken is fried to perfection and seasoned just right.  I highly recommend their chicken & waffles if it's your first time.  In my opinion, M&M is the best place for soul food in Las Vegas.

{"text":"Teach your servers how to serve or hire better ones, there's people out there who wants a paycheck. Remove the ghetto service from ur soul food restaurant and you might stay in business...hopefully break the stereotype too! Sooo disappointed here's why: 1) Not well greeted. 2) handed menu at entrance and said to \"sit wherever\" 3) took order by someone who thinks she should be somewhere but work 4) watched people who got there 5 minutes after us get there drinks as we sit thirsty for 10 more and left"}
{"text":"Peach cobbler was delicious and the service was good. Seemed to have a steady stream of regulars on a Saturday afternoon. I will go back again for sure."}

{"text":"The catfish sucks is hella fishy! The sides where to die for !and the waters are so nice I would go agian for the sides !the drinks are served in like mason jars it is the cutest thing ! Yams and the Mac is something to get !(:"}
{"text":"So I went to this location with my honey. We came in and seated are selfs like they told us. Waiter Toni was sweet  she gave us corn bread that looked like pancakes. We order kool Aid and it was so good not to sweet and Not to watered down

Food
I ordered Fried Snapper with two sides Green's and Mac and Chesse my honey order BBQ chicken and  his two sides Mash potatoes and Greens.

The Second time we came it was  Monday and we came right after breakfast. I order same drink but meatloaf black eye peas and Greens. The meatloaf was not cooked in the middle a little red and my waiter was sweet and took it back with no issue.  She also gave me more sides for free. Will be back"}
{"text":"I'm still a fan, but I have to say that something's different at my favorite Southern spot here in Vegas... and it pains me to say it. 

But the last time we went (and this was the first time I took my husband), the chicken wasn't cooked fresh - it had been sandbagged...and it was tough and stringy.  the corncakes were wonderful as always.  but everything else was off...  and this time, for the first time, we ordered dessert, the banana pudding.  it was all cookies and the two banana slices that were in it, were grey.  it was old.  and not good.  

I even asked the owner, whom I adore, if he had a new cook - and he said no - and asked why, and I couldn't bring myself to go into it with him.  But things are amiss... very very amiss... and if they continue in this direction, no amount of southern charm and wonderful service (which has not changed, by the way) will save it.   People will wait for your perfect fried chicken.  Even at lunch.  We just will.  Because it's perfect.  or at least, it used to be.  I have to go lie down...I've been putting off writing this update but I want them to get things together, so badly, so this is, in effect, my prayer.   xoxo"}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD.. I'm from the Southside of Chicago so I know what soul food is about.. This place hits it right on the head.. The portions are VERY big, the mac n cheese wasn't the \"baked\" mac n cheese that I was use to but EVERYTHING else was great... The service was AMAZING and it was very clean.. I'm coming here again when I come back to Vegas.."}
{"text":"Food was good, but that's it! My server was a JOKE! First off She didn't get me my drink & I always had to keep looking back in hoping she was going to pass me by.Secondly I paid my bill w/ my Cc & for tip I put cash. I seen my server & 2-3 of her coworkers huddling near the register looking at me & my table. I put 20%tip in cash on the table in ones. My serve walks by my table & sees the tip & eyes me down?! Like seriously?! You weren't even a good server. I was feeling nice & you gonna eye me out. I should have just grabbed My money and left.she swears like I owed her. Please!!! You gotta do a good job to earn a tip! I would seriously never eat at this place & will never recommend this place to anyone just because of the experience. Oh & if you do head there better be ready with the stare down for tip from PEARL. That was my server."}
{"text":"I have had better soul food, which is why I can't give this place 5 stars. Our server was exceptional, I really couldn't have asked for better service. The place itself could use some updating, but it's all about the food, right? I wasn't impressed with the Mac N Cheese at all. It was blah and bland for a soul food restaurant. My own personal recipe is better. I also didn't care for the cornbread cakes, give me a slice of warm cornbread from a cast iron skillet! The side of yams were perfect. I could have eaten a whole plate of those. I also had the fried pork chops which were fine. My husband ordered the oxtails and they were finger lickin' good. This place didn't wow me, but I would return to try something else and maybe get a glass of Kool-Aid. The prices are reasonable too."}
{"text":"Came here on a random Thursday night with a friend.  This restaurant is in one of the sketchier parts of town located near the Stratosphere, but my friend and I continued on in the name of food.  The restaurant itself is quite large and plainly decorated, it looked like this place could use a good sweeping too with straw wrappers/crumbs littering the floor.  We were greeted and seated right away.  Our server was friendly but not the most attentive (ex. forgot to bring out coffee requested). 

However, what saved our opinion of this restaurant was the food!  We ordered:
-Chicken Waffles ($10.99) - People you need to get this!  I about died from joy when I put the crispy on the outside, yet juicy on the inside fried chicken (3 pieces) in my mouth.  The waffles were so fluffy and delicious, I was so sad that it only came with 2 waffles.  This was definitely the stand out dish out of everything we ordered.  Get this and enjoy the savory sweetness of this dish. 
-Baked Chicken ($9.99 for Half Portion Size) - My friend ordered this and I had some of hers.  The baked chicken was smothered in a tasty BBQ sauce and the chicken was so tender that it literally fell off the bone.  The mac and cheese side was decent but the red beans and rice side dish was a little on the bland side. 
-Cornbread (free!) - Came out warm and delicious, no complaints here especially since it was free.
-Kool-Aid ($2.75) - Really good, but this was literally diabetes in a cup...just keep in mind they put a lot of sugar in it. 

I'm torn between giving this place a 3 star rating and a 4 star rating, if I could I would give it 3.5 stars.  Yeah this place was a little dingy and dirty and our server forgot a couple of things, but the food knocked it out of the park for me."}
{"text":"I'll give them 3 stars only because their fried porkchops were just THAT damn good.  They were a thick cut and they were moist and seasoned really well.

For sides, I got the cabbage, greens, and macaroni and cheese.  I can be picky about my macaroni and cheese, but this was absolutely the worst mac I've ever had.  It was basically like someone took Kraft mac and cheese, didn't cook the macaroni all the way, and used only a quarter of a packet of that fake cheese powder.  The cabbage smelled really old (I get it, I know what cabbage is SUPPOSED to smell like and i know it smells, but trust me on this one, guys).  I was scared to try the greens so..I didn't.  They could be good, but I honestly didn't get that far.

My boyfriend got the catfish and said it tastes like something out of the frozen section of the grocery store.  The potato salad side that he got was similar; no flavor and tasted like something from the grocery store deli.  He is a pescatarian and asked the waitress if the collard greens were cooked with any meat bc he can't have anything besides fish.  She said, \"No, no meat.  We cook it with turkey.\"  My definition of meat could be off but...isn't turkey meat? No?

The servers were nice and very helpful and aside from the food, they made the experience positive.  The place looks like a real hole in the wall on the inside and outside, but I don't hold that against them because hole in the wall soul food places usually have the best food!  It wasn't the case this time, aside from those pork chops."}
{"text":"Service was great, very friendly with a smile. 

Food was... Ok? I'm confused as to whether I was in on a off day or if it's always kind of bland, but it wasn't anything to rush back in for. Everyone says its so amazing, but it really wasn't. The macaroni and cheese was overlooked and tasteless, the yams were good due to being so sugary and loaded with syrup.. And the greens tasted good due to an all day cooked flavor.. The chicken was over cooked and while it was edible, it certainly wasn't the best I have had. 

I don't see myself going back, though it's not out of the question if I'm in the area.. Updated review if that happens :) happy eating!"}
{"text":"Were in Vegas for one day and decided to stop here for lunch. They start you off with cornbread pancakes that are to die for. We all ordered fried chicken and couldn't be happier. Stephanie was our waitress and she was fantastic."}
{"text":"I've had better yams and mac n cheese. Chicken and waffles were good but I think that'll change after I taste BurntSugars!"}
{"text":"We walked in and was seated. They brought out waters from a guy with missing teeth and laborious hands that were extremely calloused. We are very observant and noticed folks seated next to us after we were seated for 15 minutes.  They received their orders before us whole we waited another 20 min. After receiving our food, she abruptly placed toast (wrong type of bread) on the table and said \"oh sorry\".  The food looked like slop from a prison cell! The bacon was uncooked, potatoes looked like it was tossed in dirt and the eggs were tasteless slime. We received the cornbread cakes as an opener but it wasn't placed on our table until 20 minutes later after we arrived! My husband's dish was dried ass Mac and cheese and hairy ass fried chicken wings as if chickens mated with spiders to create their menu item (wtf)!We asked the broad for ketchup and she handed us a drop from what was left in the last ketchup bottle that was probably there when the restaurant opened and had to nerve to act as if we were inconveniencingher! That was the straw that broke the camels back. We were out of there. Foot left untouched and all! It is provably to your bests interest that you hire young ladies named Brittany or Mary not Kyesha or Respucha. So please don't go to the dark skinned sista with battle marks on her face that was created by a knife or machete. Peace!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my experience when visiting. It was clean, waitress was very nice and attentive. Great service!"}
{"text":"Talk about Southern Hospitality.  These ladies are really nice, efficient, and combined with downright comfort food, I'm game.. all day !. T shirt and jeans kinda place, and nothing fancy k? 

I found this place on a whim in a strip mall, since LV traffic is soo bad with construction, I was frustrated with driving across town - I pulled into the first place I could see. 

A group of 4, we shared full portioned meals like family style Chinese food. 

Freebies of cornbread pancakes and jars of kool-aid started us off.
My , those pancakes are different but tasty.  Kool-aid bursting with flavor and setting me back to my childhood. 

I highly recommend:  Fried chiggin, the fried catfish, sides of candied yams, fried okra, collard greens.   

Standard fare: liver-onion-gravy (hard to remove the gaminess),  potato salad,  rice and beans,   mac n cheese. 

Good portions,  didn't even have room for pie ... and good prices. 

A  solid 4/5."}
{"text":"My best friend and I in Vegas earlier this week and it was a long day of traveling and business meetings. We were in the need of some good food. We were in search to find a place that was open and not something that we could find back home.  As we came into this neighborhood we found on Yelp M&M Soul Food Café, Mississippi home cooking. We sat down the first thing they brought us were very delish sanddollar size corncakes. We saw on the menu printed \"it will take 20 mins for our order, we cook to order\". We said it better be good. We drank Kool-Aid and Muddy Waters, ate BBQ Hot Links for a snack to wait for our Smothered Fried Chicken with sides. I will say this was NOT a disappoint by means. I will be going back again.  I HIGHLY Recommend it."}
{"text":"So, I had a cravings for some chittlins, so I went to M & M Soul Food, and ordered them because I've heard good things about the restaurant. So, I'm all excited to get home and start grubbing. I open the container, and strike one, they had not been chopped into small pieces, it was like they just put one big piece of intestine inside. Strike two, the collard greens did not have any flavor, and strike three, mac n cheese was more mac than cheese. Well, I'm all about second chances, so I went back for shrimp and grits. This was absolutely terrible, a few pieces of shrimp, no cheese, and I still don't know what the hell the stuff was on top of it, so needless to say, I will not be eating there again."}
{"text":"I ordered a half order of catfish with collards and Mac n cheese. The catfish was decent small portion for a half order. The food and wait time is mostly the reason why the rating is 2 stars. Our server was very kind and polite. However, it took 30 mins to get our food. Even though there was only 2 other tables waiting for their order as well. If you want good southern food rolling smokes is undisputed champs of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is awful!!! The hostess is rude!!! The food is average at best.  The only reason they are busy is because there is no other place nearby for breakfast.  The hostess should be working in a women's prison with her personality!
I will starve before I ever go here again!"}
{"text":"Worth the trip for the peach cobbler alone, seriously, get it. Great and super friendly service and food made with love!"}
{"text":"M&M WINS AGAIN!!! This was our 3rd visit to Vegas and my wife talked weeks prior about the oxtails she could't wait to get. We arrived at this location and was immediately greeted by Relly, she took our drink order and asked if we were ready to order. I ordered the smothered chicken of course and my wife the oxtails. Relly apologized and said that they were all out of oxtails, my wife was pretty let down since she has been craving them since our last visit. Relly quickly said \"I can call our other location to see if they have some, its not far away, I can give them your order by phone and it should be ready by the time you get there\" Relly immediately called in the order and informed the sister location of our name and said they had the oxtails available. We arrived at the second location and our food was just coming out. Excellent taste as always and great service from the ladies. Thanks Relly for providing great service and going above and beyond to ensure we were accommodated. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was recently in Vegas for my bday and had a random craving for soul food so we came here. We were kind of in a rush so we decided to order take out instead of sitting down and eating. 

The service- the customer service here Sucks big time. We walked in, there is no sign that says \"to go\" or \"take out\". Nobody working in the front to direct you where to go to order. And to top of off, we flagged down one of the servers (who just so happened to be a manager) and asked her if she could take our order for our take out. Her words to us were \"you have to wait until we take care of all of our tables and maybe someone can help you\". Keep in mind we had already been waiting patiently for 15 min. We were finally able to get one young lady to assist us with our order. We ordered the friend chicken meals, with sides of candied yams, and mac n cheese. We were then told that it takes an additional 20 minutes on all fried orders. About 35 minutes later the food finally arrived. If we would've known it would've been that slow we would've sat down and eaten. 

We did notice that the kitchen employees were working very hard and get the food out quick. However the servers were not coming to get the food from the line in a timely manner. Therefor the chef had to yell a number do times for them to come get the customers food. 

The food- Great. No complaints at all. 

Overall, a really nice restaurant food wise, but the customer service is deplorable."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. I never ate there, frankly. I walked in saw how nasty the place was and was immediately turned off and that should've been my 1st sign. Not a single person greeted me upon entry. I signed the wait list and sat down. There were plenty of tables available. I waited for about 30 minutes and couldn't wait any longer for a table so I proceeded to the bar. I get there and saw crumbs and trash all over the counter. The waitress finally told me after waiting another 10 mins that the bar was closed. She did me a favor because I walked out to find some more decent food in a much cleaner and welcoming establishment. I wish I had taken pics because you can't even begin to imagine just how filthy this place was."}
{"text":"I'm from Los Angeles and someone told me that there's a M&M in Vegas... wow It wasn't crowded, it took 8 minutes for us to be seated. No one ever came to our table, but the coupled that was  seated after us received there water and there order was taken, because of the disrespected we decided to go somewhere else. Consumer Service gets a F."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem if you are not familiar with soul food.  The highlights for me are the cornbread, the chicken and waffles, and the service.  This is the best soul food around, especially for the price.  

I dream about the chicken and waffles.  The chicken is whole wings, lightly breaded then fried to perfection.  The waffles are light, crispy and have a hint of cinnamon."}
{"text":"I was so excited about coming to M&Ms! I have heard so much about it....Bae and I walked in - Hoping to get a GREAT DELICIOUS meal to celebrate her birthday.  Walking to our table, I saw food on people's plates that made me salivate IMMEDIATELY.  I was ready to tear into some food AND I was SOOOOO excited about them having koolaid!!! .....But, boy did M&Ms disappoint.  We walked in - table for two....We sat there for 15 minutes with no service, as we watched 8-12 waitresses run around. We didnt get a hello, piece of bread, water, menu....Nothing. Maybe they were so awe-struck by Joe Jackson's mean looking self that the other patrons did not matter.  But with it being my first time there - it was a HORRIBLE first impression. Additionally, because I have a disorder that makes my patience dissipate at an expeditious rate - when I am hungry (Called FUHUNGRY, a couple levels above HANGRY), by the time we were finally able to get someone for our table, I was ready to go. The waitress said - she didn't even know if she had our table or not...by the time she brought us menus, Uber had been requested and we hit the door - Aint nobody got time for that.   

I will adjust my rating IF I am able to go to M&Ms next time I'm in Vegas, and actually get serviced and am able to EAT."}
{"text":"Was in town celebrating my honeymoon pt2. Me and the Mrs wanted soul food for dinner so we picked this spot. Boy were we not disappointed. The the fried chicken wings were cooked to kill for and the oxtails and short ribs of beef were on point. If was well worth the money and the drive from the Vegas strip. It was so worth it that we came back again for breakfast. Whom ever the owner and manager is I give you kudos great job. I am from New Jersey and we know a little about cooking and this is good cooking."}
{"text":"Today two of my sons and I had lunch today. Frank was our server; he's awesome, fast, knew the menu, gave enough napkins where we didn't have to keep asking for more. We eat here at least twice a month, truly enjoy the whole atmosphere. They place great music from XM satellite as well as several televisions. The vibe is on point. If you want some rrrreally good soul food, checkout M&Ms! This is the  West Charleston location."}
{"text":"My friend Marissa and I had a delicious lunch,today. She's vegan, but still was able to find compatible food. She had fried green tomatoes, okra, and fries. I had smothered chicken, Mac and cheese, house dressing, and green beans. Needless to say, I didn't have to cook dinner thanks to the huge portions. Our server,Jay, was great, fast, and supplied extra napkins!!!! As we know many establishments are tight on the napkins! We went around 11:30 ish, lunchtime so we had about a 10 minute wait, not bad at all! I enjoy and support M&Ms and highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal!! Stopped in and grabbed the chicken and waffles and I am glad that I did! Everything was on point! Huge shout out to Sherllan (sorry for the spelling) she definitely made sure the kid was WELL taken care of. I will definitely be coming back whenever I visit the Sin City!"}
{"text":"awesome!  Large portions and full of flavor.  I had smothered chicken and boy was it worth it.  Not the place to go for low calories.  But if you want some comfort food after all you rpartying then check them out."}
{"text":"Its like going to grandmas for Sunday dinner....

Its a cozy little spot in walking distance of the Stratosphere. Service is wonderful and the people are friendly. The food is absolutely amazing. They've yet to disappoint..."}
{"text":"I want to like this place more. I've had it bookmarked for months, and when I finally got to it.. it just wasn't very exciting.

The place was packed when I went in with my boyfriend and it took a while for a server to come to our dilapidated booth and take our drink orders. I understand they're busy, and I understand this isn't a fine dining establishment. No problem. After our drink orders are taken, a long while passes before our food orders are taken. I order the fried chicken, white meat, mac n cheese, collards. Boyfriend orders chicken and waffles. 

I get my fried chicken and wait as is polite since his food wasn't there yet.. even though I'm certain waiting to eat hot fried chicken is really one of the hardest things a person can endure. It was definitely a test of love. Five minutes pass by and his food still hasn't gotten there, he insists I start, I do not argue. The chicken was lightly battered and really really dry. I also had the problem of it being very salty as previous viewers have mentioned. Not inedible, just too salty. 

His food finally comes 10 minutes after mine was dropped off. He isn't ecstatic about it, but loves my mac n cheese which I find too mushy and greasy and bland. Collards are pretty standard, cold by the time I dug in.

Overall, poor service, dry chicken, and no refills on our muddy waters. I'd give it another chance if it wasn't out of the way for me.. but it is. And so I won't."}
{"text":"Best food in all Las Vagus!! Adreana was the so friendly and made sure we tasted it all!!! Home cooking at its best!!"}
{"text":"Hello, soul food. It has been a while.

I've been to M&M a few times before. My most recent visit had to be the most notable of them all. I usually roll with the fried catfish dish (very good), but today, I decided to go for the chicken & waffles (faint-worthy). Here's a rundown of what I have tried:

***Chicken & Waffles - By far, my favorite dish here (and my favorite waffles of all time). The waffles have an airy, incredibly fluffy consistency. It is practically melts in your mouth with each bite. I actually have to admit that these even surpass the famous Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles over in L.A. While the chicken wings themselves, did not wow me as much as the waffles did, they did have a delightful crisp, with a nice touch of seasoning.
***Fried catfish - I am a catfish junkie. Suffice to say, M&M does serve up a great plate of catfish. If you're in the mood for crispy, flaky, and well seasoned pieces of fish, you can't go wrong with this order. Note: Half order includes 1 catfish + 2 sides. You may want to go for a full order if your stomach demands it.  I paired my half-order of catfish with fried okra and black eyed peas. Just like they sound, they did my body good.
***Cornbread pancakes - These come free to your table as something to munch on while waiting for food. They are usually incredibly fluffy and fall apart with a savory crumble with each bite, but my most recent visit came off a little dry.
***Muddy water - Pretty much a drink like an Arnold Palmer. Half iced tea, half lemonade. Their lemonade really does pack a sweet punch, so it does stand out above the usual Arnold Palmer.

The wait for the food was a little on the long side. We must have waited 20-30 minutes for our plates to arrive. The friendly staff made sure my coffee mug was never empty. Plus, the cornbread pancakes continuously came to our table to plump us up during the wait.

As they say, soul food sticks to your ribs. Over here at M&M Soul Food Cafe, not only did the food stick to my ribs, rear-end, and whatever flab that was hanging off of my body, it did also ingrain itself a spot in my brain as my favorite spot for chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"Food was extremely cold, sent it back and was still slightly cold the second time. I would love to come back here but I probably wouldn't."}
{"text":"Frankly, disappointing... and overpriced!. And my wife, a true Southern Belle, was so looking forward to some good home cookin'. Food was C+/B-, Service very good & friendly. Nice ambiance. But $25 for 2 lunch entrees and two ice teas??? Nope, not worth it. Sorry."}
{"text":"It really is a good as everyone says.  We went with a big group so I was able to taste a little of everything...

Fried Chicken - really favorful 
Fried Catfish - 1 piece was a little over cooked making it tough but the flavor on the breading was fantastic.  The second piece was perfect
Ox Tail - (what I ordered) Meat falling off the bone goodness.  Plenty of natural grave and juices that the smoothering of the house gravy was almost not neccesary.  It is a bit gristly for those who are squimish on fat but that's what give ox tail such flavor.
Sides - Fried okra was the star though they were all good.  Mac and cheese underwhelmed a bit.

Will definitely go back for more!"}
{"text":"Really good food but the service was super dry and they don't take credit card and don't tell you before you have to pay. When she did tell me there was no credit card it was so matter of fact like I was dumb lol. I would go back but just don't go thinking people will be soulful. Just the food. Lol."}
{"text":"Went hete for the first time yesterday. The girls at the counter were so rude. They didn't speak when i walked in. And when she got my order wrong she blamed me! First off it smelled of old bleach nooo smell of food what so ever! Which was my first red flag. I ordered chicken with 3 sides.. Omg. Just dont waste your time!"}
{"text":"So I finally ventured out to see what the hype is about. I was pretty disappointed : (

There was construction on Charleston so I had to make sure I turned in the right hole to get here. I was confused bc the doors arent really visible. I thought one was closed bc it has that reflective tape on it so we parked in the back. We walk in and the place is dead! Not a good sign!! We sit and a little bit later our waitress greets us. Without looking at the menu I order a kool aid and a muddy water. She went and got our drinks and I checked out the menu, I was kinda in price shock! The drinks were 2.75$ & 2.50$!!! Thats insane! Im paying that much for sugar water??!!! Whats worse is that throughout the time we dined I only got 1 refill and my son got none!! 

I looked at the menu and since I heard good reviews about the chicken so we opted for that. One things that was weird is that they do not have kids meals, lame!! They also dont have childrens prices on drinks. I ordered the 3piece all white with dbl man n cheese and rice w gravy. I noticed there was a 20min wait for fried foods and was fine with that. 

Our waitress brought us the cornbread pancakes and I tried them and they were yummy. Shortly after my chicken arrived, not even a 10 min wait! Idk if thats good or bad... Anyway, the order included 1 breast and 2 wings... Wtf? Im paying 13.99$ for that!? At least give me 2 breasts!

Lets talk about the chicken: I expected something orgasmic, alas the only one I had was later that day when I found out Old Navy had 50% off clearance sale. My son grabbed the wings and I was left with the breast. I took a bite and instantly needed water; it tasted as though their seasoning was only salt! Dont get me wrong, I love salt, but sheesh! Thank goodness I ordered a side of gravy (which she forgot) I sucked down my drink and waited for a refill... Which took almost 20mins and I had to ask for one even though she walked by my empty glass... 2wice!! Once I got my refill I went back to my chicken. I guess it was semi juicy but what seriously turned me off was the breading. I have never ever tasted breading that salty! 

I tried the sides and was soooo let down! The mac n cheese was tasteless and freakin dry!! What a sad thing bc I ordered 2 sides and my son didnt even touch his! The rice and gravy was meh, nothing special. I guess the only good think was the corn bread. Our waitress was ok, only checked on us once which was sucky. The others seemed super nice to other diners in there though : (

This place imo is over-rated and seriously over-priced! The chicken was semi juicy but wayyyy too salty. I couldnt even finish a breast and trust me im a fatty and love me some chicken! I've had soul food before, my bro in law is from Louisiana and has cooked some yummy eats! If this is what Mississippi soul food is then hit dog its hella shitty! I'll stick to cooking my own home-made, not dry, mac n cheese and super yummy fried chicken!"}
{"text":"Everything was super tasty. The time to get your food is slow, but it says that on the menu they make everything to order.

Our server was fast and friendly, kept our glasses filled and constantly checked on us. 

I guess it's good that this isn't very close to home. So much deliciousness."}
{"text":"If there were more stars,I would give more stars...I wasn't even planning to go there....was driving to another restaurant,for a cheesesteak...and there it was,I an glass I stopped...I hardly ever say someone makes the best fried chicken,cause my mother makes the best fried chicken...but this stuff eight there...my ol my...the staff was great and the prices were great...definitely will recommend and go back..."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, didn't like the service (I walked in with my friend and I was quickly told that I don't look like I from Vegas, how do people from Vegas look like )..
... nor the food was good. Mac n cheese was definitely dry and collard greens... Correction CAN collard greens were not too fitting as well.. Let's not talk about chicken.. I'm not sure if chicken \"tight\" is considered a \"white meat\" I got charged an extra 1$ for that. (Weirdest white meat I have ever tasted) 

Nonetheless, I do have to say I LOVE, soul food.. This place was a miss though, I am on a mission to find a good spot in Vegas."}
{"text":"Honestly came here to have breakfast, which we got seated quickly but then they took about 15 minutes to take our drink order which we asked for sugar and cream and it was ignored to where we had to get up and get it outself, once they took our actual order  the girl comes back in 5 minutes saying oh breakfast is over so we tell them ok we are leaving then, since we really wanted breakfast. Places like this are why we have issues in the world today. The discrimination against us quite honestly was but much and we aren't even white, oh well, Definitely would give this negative stars just on customer service alone. I'll tell anyone that asks not to go there"}
{"text":"I was there on Saturday. Took my nephew,  niece and daughter. Food was great, environment authentic, and the service was just perfect, impeccable and wonderful. Thank you Tonisha!!  I will be bringing my family again!"}
{"text":"For genuine southern soul food this is the place to come to and enjoy a nice gmason glass full of Kool-aid  just like grandma used to make one sip and it will take you back to being a kid. Now the food is definitely worth the wait I ordered the fried chicken with my 3 sides collard greens, Mac and cheese, Red beans and rice. This food is definitely comfort food mmmmmmhhhhhh mmmmmmhhhhhh good."}
{"text":"Cornbread pancakes are pretty good but if Id come back it would definitely be for the smothered chicken and warm service. The chicken was Deeeeelish! Crunchy and juicy, absolutely amazing. And all staff was friendly and attentive. A place always earns points for their service. 
I will definitely avoid Mac n cheese and peach cobbler. Mac and cheese wasn't cheesy at all and the peach cobbler was way, WAY too sweet. 
I came to a conclusion that carry out food usually doesn't taste as good (even though I usually start eating it in the car, don't judge!). I will have to try them again for a sit down meal to draw a decision."}
{"text":"Great Southern food here! 
The fried chicken & smothered chicken are a must try.
I wish I could just eat the cornbread...! Soo good.

The service was great, even considering it was lunch time with a packed cafe.

I love the counter seating, makes it personal.

If your down near the Stratosphere and hungry, check this place out."}
{"text":"OMG! The food and service are stellar! Me and 8 girlfriends stumble in after going to Rehab at the Hard Rock. Lucky for us there were enough seats at the bar for us to sit together. The waitress was so sweet and understanding of our \"turned up\" situation. She was very patient with us and took all our individual orders. the food was promptly served hot fresh and delicious. They have the best candied yams I ever had in my life! Boxing champ FLoyd Mayweather was there dining with his family and was nice enough to take a few pictures with us! This will be a must have everytime I come to Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"after trying both locations, i find the portions small and  relatively expensive.  you can find better fried chicken at raising canes, for example."}
{"text":"What a fun soul food dining experience. Half plates are filling. They come with 2 sides & start with corn cakes/bread. Big parking lot. Very busy at 3pm with dining patrons & take out orders. Loved the collard, sweet & not oily. Food served immediately & wonderfully temperature hot! Enjoyed the music. Service was super."}
{"text":"This place started in Los Angeles and opened a sister location in Vegas.  The LA place was sold and the family's only place is in Vegas. It's located in a strip mall with a lot of parking.  About 15 tables and a small counter fill this interior along with the walls of photos of famous people who know the owners.

I need to put out a disclaimer that I'm writing this review the next day after having a horrible dinner at Del Frisco's Double Eagle, so when I write about Quality:Price ratio, you can see where my bias is coming from.

When we found out there was a M&M in Vegas, we knew we had to try it based on the reputation they built in Los Angeles.  We got there at the perfect time ahead of a party of what looked like 20 people celebrating a 40th birthday.  The staff is really friendly and for a mom n pop operation that thinks Michelin is a tire, we got great service.  The food does take a long time to get to the table, but that's par for the course when they are dropping each order into the deep fry.  Other places will cook in advance and use heat lamps. Not M&M.  You have to wait 20 minutes for chicken to fry.

I got the fried chicken, greens, mac n cheese, and Kool-Aid.  I don't know how they do it, but the skin on the chicken is crispy good, but the batter isn't burned dark.  The batter sticks to the skin and the skin will just peel off the meat leaving you with the most crispy potato chip type delicacy.  I bet you can just sell the deep fried skin. It's that good. 

The others at the table had the gumbo, ox tail and short rib.  All was excellent.  They also serve the table cornbread that looks like corn pancakes. They are buttery, sweet and have a nice crispy edge.  Those little cakes are addicting.  For 4 of us, the bill was $63.

Some might say it's pricey, but for what we got, it was worth the money.  We spent about $320 at Del Friscos later that day.  We spent about 5 times what we spent at M&M and our food at M&M was 5 times better than what we had at Del Friscos.  If I was told I had to spend $320 and $63 on the two meals I had, I would have paid $320 to M&M's.  Anyway...  you might want to go read my Del Frisco review."}
{"text":"I came here on a recommendation from a friend and WHAT A GEM!  M&M is legit.  The food, the service, the atmosphere, the overall friendliness and vibe are amazing.  If you want a down-home, comfort food experience in Las Vegas, M&M is where to go.

My food highlights:

1. Corn Pancakes - Order as many as you can.  These suckers are freaking addicting and ohh so orgasmically good.  Slightly crispy exterior, butter soft interior, with amazing flavor.

2. Chicken and Waffles - Man the chicken is moist, crispy and NEVER dry.  The waffles are sweet and fluffy and don't forget the hot sauce and syrup!

3. Oxtail - *DROOOLLLLLL*. I love oxtail, and the gravy that drowns the super tender oxtail... I shudder to think about the awesomeness.

4. Ribs - Tender... Check. Tasty... Check. Order it? Do it.

5. Gumbo - Order a small because honestly, after all of the above, can you fit anymore?  Smokey, with a bit of spice and full of seafood. NOM!

If you are in Vegas on a random Sunday afternoon looking to kill some time and gain some weight, go to M&M's and you will not regret it at all!"}
{"text":"I just love this place, the food is what brings me.  I get cravings and the staff is what keeps me!  They always make me feel so welcome and I always leave with such a happy feeling in my heart and my tummy!  Special thanks to the owner, your staff is a reflection of you!  Kudos!"}
{"text":"This place is hands down my favorite for soul food!i call it comfort food. They nail it every time. I highly recommend the Ox Tail!"}
{"text":"Despite the reviews, I decided to give this place a try. Overall the place wasn't half bad
 The amount of time we had to wait was uncalled for as there were several tables available. I along with my 6 dining companions were seated finally. But the table we were seated at was still being cleaned. The person who was doing the cleaning didn't even bother to excuse himself while reaching over myself and my dining companions. Any how our drink orders were taken, and brought to us. Not too long after that, pancakes, oops I mean hot water cornbread was served. I've never seen cornbread look like a pancake, and I never want to again. Give me a nice thick piece of cornbread, not a flat pancake to eat my greens with. I liked my food, but I didn't love it. The service wasn't bad either. They could use some more customer service training tho. The smothered chicken I had was good, the gravy too. The greens were on point, but the mashed potatoes tasted more like chunky potatoes, with gravy."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely a 5. I'd eaten here before and thought it was just ok. My food today was soooo good. I had the smothered chicken, Mac and cheese, collard greens and peach cobbler! We got so much food I also have dinner! Our server Crystal was amazing! She was quick, friendly and super polite!"}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would.  This place has  THE WORST Customer service that I have experienced in my life!  It took 30 minutes for them to take my To Go order at the counter.  to make things even worse they had no sign up or they did not advise me when they gave me the menu that have their menu was sold out.  So basically I waited 30 minutes for no reason.  I would never come here again and I would never recommend this to anyone that I know."}
{"text":"My grandmother and aunt owned a soulfood restaurant until she retired.  Regarding the food...it was almost like eating at my grandmama's table.  I had smothered chicken, mac-n-cheese, fried okra and red beans and rice for sides.  A+, if I ever return to Vegas, I will be stopping in.  The atmosphere was fine and the waitress was very attentive."}
{"text":"On January 14, 2011 we had the unfortunate opportunity to eat at M & M Soul Food Cafe.  It took 5 waitresses 20 minutes to come take our order as they chatted amongst themselves about the previous nights activities.  When they took our order, it took us one hour (I am not kidding) to get our food, remind you now this restaurant had maybe 20 patrons.  My husband ordered the hash and eggs.  When it came an hour later it was burned completly on the bottom (charred) and the egg on top was fried hard, he had ordered over easy.  When we complained about our order, our waitress, blatantly rolled her eyes.  We will never return to this place again.  We should have know from the minute we got there, as the place was a little no, I take that back, it was on the grungy side.  I don't know how this place stays open!"}
{"text":"It's not just the fantastic down home cooking although the Fried Catfish and fresh southern cooked vegetables are to die for. It ain't even the fact that the place is squeaky clean and no frills. It's the staff and make it a great place to go, they are courteous, welcoming and attentive.
Great place to go and enjoy everything M&M's has to offer."}
{"text":"There is a 2nd M&M Soul Food Cafe located on North Side of Las Vegas. We were out taking in city sights. Hunger pains began to sit in as I searched Yelp for nearby restaurants. M&M Soul Food Cafe appeared. It was in a 15 min walking distance. 
When we arrived, we were greeted by the Male employee. This location was just as busy as the Sister location. Our server was nice but her memory skills weren't the greatest. We ordered thenBBQ Chicken, Cabbage, Yams & Blackeyed Peas. She kept repeating the order back to us. I'd assume to make sure it's correct. While waiting, I viewed all the photos on the wall of a Man (Owner) and Famous Celebrities. Pictured is Comedians, Singers, & Actors. 
The BBQ Chicken doesn't stand up to the Fried Chicken. It was seasoned to perfection. All the fixing were finger licking good. No Complaints at all. Washed it down with that Southern Sweet Tea!!! Man, What Foodie Memories were made about this joint. Must Try if in Vegas"}
{"text":"Great Mom & Pop Business serving up Southern Cuisine to North Las Vegas. Hubby & I walked a few blocks down from the Stratosphere Casino and Hotel. You could smell the Fried Chicken from down the Street. John immediately said, oh yes we can go get Chicken. We crossed 2 lanes of traffic following the smell. 
Small white building said M&M Soul Food Cafe. Leosha was our server. Friendly and busy. She was waiting on several tables and still gave quality service. 
John and I shared Crispy Fried Chicken; Sinfully Delicious Candid Yams, Collard Greens, Black Eyed Peas & Cabbage. Man do I miss My Mother's Cooking. 
Great Soulful Music Playing in The Background. We throughly enjoyed our Dinner. Only negative was flies. Hey, 110 degrees outside. They want to cool off too...lol"}
{"text":"The fried chicken was really good. It reminded me of the south. The friend chicken was really good, the greens were really good. My lady had the links which tasted good as well. The only downside is that visiting its pretty far off the strip in a run down shopping center but other then that nothing to complain about"}
{"text":"Mmmm... this soul food cafe is so worth the extra bit of time to get here from the Strip (assuming you are a tourist that rolled poorly and need to eat your sorrows away with good ol' Southern hospitality). After a good weekend out, before heading home to California ,we wanted to try a unique restaurant to Vegas. Low and behold, it took us here!

The restaurant inside is very narrow, but that doesn't stop the lively atmosphere inside from stopping. We walked into massive numbers of families gathered together over the weekend for a meal. Brunch menu on the weekends gives you a more affordable but limited selection of food. Here's what we ended up getting:

* Chicken & Waffles - Classic, everyday soul food. The chicken was really good, but the waffles themselves were pretty forgettable. This certainly is no Roscoe's, but for the chicken itself, I am a fan.

* Catfish Basket - Fried catfish is always amazing when battered and deep fried well, and the ones here certainly hold on its own. Hushpuppies and fries on the side complimented the meal well. I just wish there was more fish in that basket of ours.

For Soul food in Vegas, M&M definitely holds its own. While service was a bit slow, I can respect that they had a lot of people to cycle through. Be prepared though if you are hungry or needing some grub after a fun night out in Sin City.

Parking is plentiful in a private lout outside the restaurant."}
{"text":"Hands down best soul food in Vegas! Pricey! But worth every penny! If you love chitlin's, corn bread, Mac and cheese and collard greens! This is the place."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this little gem as we were leaving the Stratosphere. The fried chicken, yams, green beans, and corn cakes were delicious! Definitely recommend this spot if your looking for some good soul food. The prices are reasonable and the staff is really friendly. Will have to go back next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Food is good but the service is slow!! Also I think this place needs a little something to make it have a warming feeling."}
{"text":"If I could give NO STARS I would. First the wait was ridiculous ! Im literally looking into the restaurant at empty tables and we still waited about an hour. The furniture looks like something from a yard sale for the owner to say the place is \"new\". The waiting area was literally two rows of fold out lawn chairs . Now on the the food. The food is definitely no worth the money and they over cooked the fish. The fish was fried to the point where it's was just batter . I understand trying to \"save money\" but when you have a business, under cutting your customers is not the way to go . My friends snapper looked like 1 filet cut in half again!  My fish was one small little filet .I was so disappointed with my plate I instantly returned it . The owner came out to speak with us and offered to compensate our horrible experience with a discount . The discount was a gracious 3% off !! That's not even tax! This place is ridiculous and a disgrace to the name and brand \"M&M soul food\" I'm so pissed & disappointed !!!"}
{"text":"Awful!! The only word I can think of.  Staff was super friendly but the food was awful.  We ordered full fried chicken dinner (all white meat).  Paid extra for all white meat and expected more than just two wings with small piece of white meat. Side dishes were just OK.  We ate the fried chicken and sides at the restaurant and took the full order of short ribs home.   Just tried to eat the short ribs but there was no lean meat!!  All fat and bone.  Yuk!!!   Oh, wait, the corn bread was amazing.  Air-conditioning inadequate and restaurant needs to be scrubbed down with bleach.  A fresh coat of paint would be nice, too.  And, don't even think of going to the ladies room.  Never, never again."}
{"text":"They have the best Ox Tail ! It was so tender and a half of an order is still huge! I ordered two sides Red Beans and Rice and Potato Salad. The rice was okay but I'm not used to having the gravy on it. The salad was a little on the sweet side.

The stand out items for me were the Ox tail, Banana Pudding and the Muddy Waters. I was sorry that I ordered the lemon cake once I had a bite of the Banana pudding. It was comfort food at it's best!  The lemon cake was good but I would choose the pudding over it any day!"}
{"text":"I like this place. The atmosphere - well there honestly wasn't much of that but everything else was excellent. The food was hot and cooked to order, the waitstaff was awesome, and the wait-time for food wasn't bad at all - especially considering they cook to order. The cook even came out and asked if I'd like him to grill onions for me with my meal. Hospitality is obviously an element they are not lacking! It was nice. Everyone was smiling and social and just plain pleasant. What they don't have in décor or atmosphere they make up in character and hospitality. 

Be warned - this is not a date night type of place. It's a pick-it-up-to-go type of place!"}
{"text":"We were on a mission for the best fried chicken in Vegas. After reading the reviews we had to try it. And, it did not disappoint!!!!  Had the 1/2 order with mac n cheese and collard greens. I am seriously fat dumb and happy right now!!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a meal off of the strip. We stopped in on a Wednesday afternoon and had no problem getting a table. Our waiter Brett was a fellow Ohioan and extended so much hospitality. He recommended several menu options. My husband had the oxtails and I had the catfish. The food was delicious. I'm particular about collard greens but these were tasty. Would def recommend for soul food in Vegas."}
{"text":"This location is recently opened and last night was my first time there. The food is excellent and our server Arecella was outstanding. She treated us like family and was very attentive. We did not have to ask for a refill and she answered all questions with a great smile. I had the smothered port chops with Mac N Cheese and rice and gravy, Chris had the fried port chops, with yams and rice and gravy and Alvin had the fried chicken with yams and an order of fried fish. I enjoyed the my meal and I will be back. Glad to see they are open a bit later than their Charleston location. Not a high ambience kind of place but the food is good, reasonably priced and I like the have  TV's on  various games."}
{"text":"Really good fried chicken!! I also really like the red beans and rice that comes with a hot link.
Service is a little questionable at times, but the food is always good!"}
{"text":"This location has his good and bad......the good, is the food....... the bad, is the poor organization and service. Don't get me wrong, they are friendly and polite. This location is just very busy and they have no real system for seating you properly and taking your order. It is just a mass of confusion from the moment you walk in until you are seated........They have really improved lately on the ordering process, it used to take forever to order and get your food, but lately they are much more improved on the timing, so hopefully they will get the seating issue under control next.......
The food though....solid four stars, all the time.....
The Fried Chicken is my husbands favorite, and he likes the collard greens, mac & cheese for the sides. 
I like the red beans and rice appetizer. It comes with a full hot link plus, hot link cut up in the beans. This appetizer is really a full meal. 
The corn bread is amazing!!!!!!"}
{"text":"M&M serves up the very best Soul Food in Las Vegas. As a new resident, I walked into M&M's location on Charleston looking for the type home-cooked meal that my grandmother once prepared and I was totally shocked when I found it! 

This deceptively simple style of food is actually complex and demands 3 critical elements: high-quality meats/vegetables, skilled preparation techniques and a genuine passion to do it right: M&M consistently delivers this quality to every single plate that comes out of their kitchen. M&M may well be the best kept culinary secret in Las Vegas. I turned my next door neighbor onto M&M and she now orders take-out for her family and serves it up to her kids as if it's her own at least twice a week because they just can't seem to get enough; neither can I! Don't forget to order the fruit cobbler or banana pudding!"}
{"text":"Experience:  I have been here before and really enjoyed the food, so I decided to come back and bring some friends. There was a total of 6 of us. 

Facility: it's located in the end of an older strip mall right on Charleston. It is kinda a long room with tables down one side and the kitchen on the other. It's not the most up to date, modern place, but it's clean and comfortable. 

Service:  our waitress was Tashara and she was really busy, but the times she was at our table, she was attentive and nice, and she answered all our questions. 
There were a few times we had to ask for refills.  It's nice when a sever does that naturally. Then there was even a pretty long period where we all went without drinks after the food was served, and I had to flag down another waitress, because ours was too busy. 
When we were taking a final picture a playful guy photo-bombed us...turns out he was the owner Tim. He chatted with us for a few minutes, and he was super personable and cool. 

Food:  everyone at the table decided to order something different so we could taste many things. 
BBQ Shortribs: I loved these. They could have used a little more sauce, but these were one of my favs. 
Oxtails: they were tender and delicious and smothered in the house gravy. Definitely my other fav dish!
Smothered chicken: I thought this would be a filet, but it was pieces of their fried chicken with the house gravy. Pretty good. 
Fried chicken: I like the fried chicken, but it's not out if this world. It's just good. 
BBQ chicken: meh. It definitely needed more sauce.  This was my least fav dish. 
Catfish: the catfish was at the top half of the good dishes. It was moist in the middle and crispy on the outside. I was SUPER disappointed they brought me packets of tartar.  I just expected a good southern spot to make their own. 
Sides: we had cabbage, mashed potatoes, green beans, Mac and cheese, fried okra, and greens.  Most of them were just ok, but the fried okra was on point! 

Overall:  I still like this place. It reminds me of just going to a friends house to eat. The food tastes homemade. Some things could use a little improvement, but overall I need my southern fix and this does it."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for sometime.  The place is bigger then it looks from outside.  The place looks clean on the inside but the smell of oil could be overwhelming. However it is soul food and you cannot make real soul food without a lot of fried foods....

I decided to try the Chicken Fried Steak.  My server did warn me it's not your typical chicken fried steak, it's a real chicken breast hand breaded and cooked to order.  It came with Mississippi potatoes which were awesome tasting and a small biscuit with gravy.

The food here is true soul food and I am a fan....If you are in the area, you should stop in and try this place.  My server was awesome, she has been there since they opened this place and is as sweet as can be.

I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I've never been to M & M 's in LV.  My husband & I came on a Sunday afternoon.  It wasn't crowded & the staff were attentive, but in your face every second so that you that you could not enjoy your food.  Good place to eat some good soul food. The staff, our waitress made it even BETTER!"}
{"text":"Just left this fabulous restaurant a few hours ago. They are deserving of 5+ stars. A coworker of mine suggested this soul food place since she previously lived in Vegas. My hubby and I have been wanting to try it and today, the day before Thanksgiving was the best time to try it. There was no wait. We got seated right when we walked in. I tried the short ribs with gravy, Mac and cheese, and potato salad. My hubby had the chicken and waffles. Both entrees were amazing!! They give free cornbread too. I can't wait for our next trip here, we'll be back in a few weeks and I'm going to try something new! Great fast service and delicious food."}
{"text":"I've been to their location on Charleston Blvd and to me that's the best one. The only reason we wanted to try this one was because the other one was crowded. The food was good but the service was mediocre. With about a max of 10 people in there, they never checked on us once. They were too busy chit chatting in the front of the restaurant. This will probably be the last time we come back to this location."}
{"text":"The restaurant on Las Vegas Blvd. is no good their chicken was not crunchy at all it was raw their green beans had no taste I'm pretty sure they opened up a can of green beans. macaroni and cheese was dry and the Red beans and rice was watery. waitress was stoned out of her head. the one on Charleston has good crispy chicken good string beans good red beans and rice The place is dirty but it's good."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today and was greeted by a very nice server. Gave us cornbread pancakes to start off for free. Me and my boyfriend both ordered kool aid and it was good. I had the meat loaf and my boyfriend had the fried chicken. Food was pretty good. Side dishes we're yummy especially the Mac n cheese. Defiantly would go back."}
{"text":"Finally got here after years of \"meaning to\".  Great atmosphere and service. And the food was everything I'd hoped for. The chicken didn't disappoint and the sides were phenomenal. Tried the Mac & Cheese, cabbage & red bean and rice. Best southern cooking I've had in Vegas. Down to the mason jar glasses. Looking forward to my next trip and trying the waffles."}
{"text":"We arrive at M&M's on Sunday at 1pm and leave at 2:30pm with our food to go, because it never came, and the waitress waited 1 hour to put the order in. We get back to the hotel and notice that we have a take out order of food that's incorrect. Save yourself the time and the money and go somewhere else. It's dirty with horrible service."}
{"text":"My husband has been wanting to come here for the past few years but we haven't managed to fit it in until this trip. This review is based on service alone because we never even got seated before we decided to leave. It was like a bad movie scene walking in,  there were 4 cooks sitting around at a table still in aprons, 1 server yelling in the window for her food before she finally asked who the f**k is cooking her food & all the cooks just shrugged & 1 walked back in the kitchen. We were told it'd be a 45 minute wait on a Tuesday afternoon at 3pm with only 3 tables in the restaurant. We waited for about 30 before we just left and said never again. We live in Houston & appreciate good home style food but I don't care how good your food is if your service is this awful."}
{"text":"This is the worst place hands down! Now I normally try and be unbiased, atleast as much as possible but I've visited this location two different times almost a year apart and got the exact same sorry food and treatment. Each time I've ordered the baked chicken , rice and gravy, and greens ! Each time it has taken them close to an hour to bring me my food and each time the food has been overall horrible ! Did I mention both times I've ordered to go! The first time after 30 mins they came back and asked me what did I order! This last occasion they forgot the sides after about 40 mins! There are better places in town that I would recommend"}
{"text":"My review is based on the entire experience. Food & Service. 

Let me start off by saying that my family and I went here on a Sunday night. Probably should have known that the wait was going to be a little longer than usual. 

When we walked in, the place was PACKED. The poor little waitresses were running around trying to serve everyone as best they could, but the amount of people seemed to be overwhelming. I'm pretty forgiving so the wait (which was close to an hour and fifteen minutes WITH a toddler) was ALRIGHT. Good thing I had my phone full of kid-apps to keep my little guy entertained. Our waitress probably popped over like 2 times in that hour and fifteen minutes. I feel like she could have popped over a few MORE times, but she seemed so exhausted and overwhelmed, I really just felt bad for her. 

What really bothered me was our food. First off the served us these little corn cakes, but after waiting forty minutes, I contemplated asking the waitress to give us two more batches because we were famished at that point. 

When the rest of our food came out (fried chicken, greens, beans, mac n cheese for my boyfriend and another order of fried chicken, this time smothered in gravy and the same sides for me and my little guy) My boyfriends food was hot but I found it odd that mine was cold. I feel like they fried the chicken, left it out for an hour to cool, THEN dumped the luke warm gravy on it. The sides were pretty good. The collards were very flavorful and had a little kick, the beans had just the right amount of seasoning and the mac n cheese was creamy but it would have been nice to have a little bit more cheese. 

AGAIN, the place was EXTREMELY busy and I'm pretty forgiving; just maybe keep in mind what day you try to come in. And really, I can wait for a while before I start to get really agitated, but I just ask that my food be HOT when it comes out ESPECIALLY having to wait that long. We'll definitely come back ....... on a not-so-busy day."}
{"text":"Food was terrible, no flavor, waitress was sweet. BBQ chicken tasted like if it was boiled with a little BBQ sauce. Mac n cheese had no flavor, tasted as if it was sprinkled with cheese powder. Potato salad seemed as if it was boxed mashed potatoes with relish. The only thing that tasted good was the corn bread. This place is dirty, Will never return. DO NOT waste your money."}
{"text":"great soul food. loved the service. they served kool aid! great i had the smothered chicken and the greens as well it was delicious. and the cornbread they bring out is phenomenal"}
{"text":"$14 for two pieces of over done fried chicken. Place is dirty and service sucks. Don't bother, better off going to KFC."}
{"text":"This was my first time at the restaurant. The Meatloaf taste like spam. The only thing real good was the cornbread dressing and the greens. The kool-aid is good as well."}
{"text":"Wow! :-) So thank you, Yelpy toy for this find! After a day of shopping I was famished! I was in the mood for southern comfort food. I ran this place by my man Friday and we headed over. It's an inconspicuous corner spot in a strip center. We were greeted at the door and seated immediately by a most friendly woman. We both ordered small plates as it was late afternoon do dinner would be around the corner. Small, sweet cornmeal cakes were brought to our table while we waited...they were most welcomed and delicious! The fried chicken was tender on the inside and crispy on the out, wonderfully seasoned. Red bean & rice along with fried okra finished this plate off nicely. The pork chop was also seasoned well if a tad dry...I could have and should have asked for gravy. The greens were delightful, the right consistency with the perfect amount of smoky bacon goodness. The waitress kept our drinks full. We wrapped it all up with? Yep, you guessed it...banana pudding. Folks, step out of your comfort zone...give this place the college try. I'm so pleased we did...added to the list of Vegas faves."}
{"text":"I cannot wait to go back!  My friend and I went here for lunch, I've only heard amazing things about it and I've been dying to go. When we walked in, I think every waitress and waiter in the whole place greeted us. They were all so pleasant and seemed genuinely happy to be there and happy to serve. The food service was fast and the food was hot and delicious.

I ordered the smothered chicken, with macaroni & cheese and greens, and I was in heaven. Even after being smothered in their delicious brown gravy, the fried chicken was crispy, juicy, and cooked to perfection. The macaroni and cheese is made from scratch, you can taste all of the seasonings and cheeses melted into the noodles. Normally I'm a fan of really creamy macaroni and cheese but there was so much flavor to this, I couldn't say a bad thing about it. I loved the greens, they were cooked perfectly and very flavorful. My friend ordered the fried catfish, it was also cooked perfectly, the breading had just enough flavor to give the fish a little kick without overpowering the taste. Her fried okra was also amazing, the coating they use tastes amazing! Unfortunately, neither of us had room for dessert. =(

Oh yeah, and they serve Kool-Aid!"}
{"text":"The service was subpar, the waitress was inattentive and very slow to return to the table. Some of the food was tolerable. But there were dried edges on the meat, as if it had been left out for a long time or something.  Overall, I kind of enjoyed a couple things but I would probably never go back."}
{"text":"The wait for the food was longer than expected, but for food made to order I guess I can make an exception.  My husband loves that they served Koolaid.  So waiting our waitress redeemed herself for not checking on us or giving us an update on our food.  She brought him a glass of Koolaid .  The catfish is very well seasoned and fried nice.  I had the shrimp and grits but I wish I stuck to the catfish.  The shrimp and grits had no flavor I had to keep putting salt and hot sauce on it. But overall the staff was nice."}
{"text":"Dark fried chicken was so so so good. Some of the best I've had without question. Skin was seasoned well and really crispy. Cornbread pudding was tasty, the fried okra was crispy and fresh, and the collard greens were okay. The yams are good but really sweet. Complimentary corn bread cakes were warm and delicious."}
{"text":"Arrived at this establishment around 4 PM. Waited 20 minutes for waitress. I think there was confusion about who should wait on our table in an almost empty restaurant. Ice cold coffee, cold food Served along with Styrofoam Cup of water with the hole in the bottom. Traveled all the way from Alaska for poor customer service. Thanks but no thanks."}
{"text":"Muddy water and corn bread is the best here by far! I love their greens and their smothered fried chicken! Good service as well"}
{"text":"We ordered the gravy ribs, bbq ribs, full chicken plate, catfish plate, snapper plate.  We ordered several sides but we were told 45 minutes later that they ran out of mac n cheese, collard greens, yams.  The sides came 30 mins after we received our entrees.  The service was good.  We enjoyed the sweet tea!  Not sure if I would recommend."}
{"text":"This was the worst restaurant I have ever been to the fried Chicken was over cooked and very hard you could not eat it and management was so unorganized and really could care less"}
{"text":"This was the worst restaurant that I had ever been to the food was horrible there was only a few people in the restaurant and the hostess made us wait the chicken I ordered was very hard and I couldn't eat it when we were getting ready to leave is when they brought the corn bread I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to any one not even people that I don't like"}
{"text":"Best fried chicken & waffles ever. I love coming here whenever I'm in town. Great staff. The owner is very nice!"}
{"text":"This place really understands the meaning of customer service and hospitality! 
My wife and I got here early before they opened.  Servers were nice enough to open early give us free drinks. What a way to start the day!  It was the first time trying muddy water and it was quite refreshing! 

Gumbo was killer and ended up ordering everything lol.
Catfish was not greasy at all and batter was right on the spot as the ones I ate in New Orleans. 
Excuse my language but God damn this is how chicken is made!  This place takes out Roscos and Everette n Jones all day! 
Thank you for making the drive out worth while!  Will make sure to stop by every time in Vegas. God bless!"}
{"text":"I gave this restaurant  2 stars because the customer service was good. If not for that, I would have given it a 1.  The food, with the exception  of the hot water cornbread, was just mediocre. I had a pork chop, mashed potatoes  and greens. All of which, lacked seasoning and sadly, the chop was fried too hard for my taste. One sample of my hubby's mac & cheese left me shaking my head in disbelief. How can you mess up sonething that simple? In summary, I know soul food and this ain't it."}
{"text":"I had the meatloaf, collard greens and mac & cheese. It was delicious! Best collard greens I've ever had. Not soggy at all. Good sweet tea. Okay service. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This place was so freaking good. I still have cravings for this place. The little apps that's they offered were so good. Like little cornbread pancakes. Loved their pork chop. Super filling. Wish I would have ordered a full pack."}
{"text":"We received complimentary cornbread pancakes - delicious.  Each of us ordered fried chicken as an entree with me choosing dark meat and Ann white.  Mine was moist and delicious; Ann's was dry.  I enjoyed the crispy crust, Ann didn't.  Each came with a choice of 3 sides. Together we sampled macaroni and cheese (good), green beans (canned), collard greens (best I have ever had), fried okra (very good) and sweet potatoes (pretty good).  The restaurant was in process of closing for the night as we began to exit so the biggest, baddest-looking security guard I have ever seen opened the unlocked door and watched as we got safely in our car."}
{"text":"This place was great from the food to the service to the sweet tea. You don't typically go somewhere in this area and ask for sweet tea because nine out of ten times they will offer you raspberry tea. I had the smothered pork chops, collard greens, fried okra, and dressing. It was all VERY good. Made me feel like I was at grandmas. I will definitely come back the next I'm in town."}
{"text":"This was some of the worst soul food i ever had i just had to try them since everyone talks about it i doubt that i would ever come back when i come to Vegas i wanna way the best and this was definitely not that smh. I ordered smothered chops with rice n grave, mac n cheese, and dressing i wasted everything"}
{"text":"Service great, food amazing, PRICES  even better! Portions were huge! I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I haven't gotten my food yet and I don't care if the food is bomb after this.  The service is effin terrible and I won't be back.  The wait staff and their lack of service is annoying.  My man and I waited 10 mins before flagging the waitress down for water (I guess our closed menus weren't universal language for being ready). We were brought corn bread but weren't given silverware for another 10 mins.  If I was not on this date and we didn't just have a wonderful Vday weekend, I would set it off.  We're getting this mess to go!!!!!!!!!  Then, he had to find the chick to pay!  Um hello, if I ask for togo as soon as I get our food isn't that a clear indication that we're ready to pay!!!!  Then she never bought his lemonade, had water instead.  A 45 min debacle for what turned into takeout. Smh"}
{"text":"The pancake corn bread is delicious.
You can't go wrong with anything on the menu.
I like the liver & onion, sweet yams, & cornbread stuffing."}
{"text":"No wait to be seated.  Friendly wait staff.  We didn't have to wait too long for our food.  Our meals were hot.  But that is where the positive ends.

I grew up eating real southern soul food in Florida.  THIS is not real soul food.  It's over-priced wanna-be without any flavor.

There were LOTS of stems in the collard greens.  The \"meatloaf\" was nothing more than a salsbury steak, and a very small portion at that.  Also, the meat was raw in the center.  Undercooked ground beef is a recipe for food poisoning!  The fried pork chop was thin, mostly bone and fat, and flavorless.  The black-eyed peas were so over cooked they were mush and had a burnt taste to them.  Their \"world famous\" corn cakes were rubbery and flavorless.  They only good thing really were the mashed potatoes that had decent flavor and lumps (yes I love lumps in my mashed potatoes).  

The music was so loud it was impossible to carry on a conversation without yelling.  We went for dinner, so the sun was starting to set and was blazing down onto the tables making it hot and stuffy inside.  The staff never offered to change the blinds to block the sun even with us squinting and fanning ourselves while trying to block the sun with our hands.  Between the heat, the sun, and the sheer volume of noise from the music, I left with a pounding headache.  

The floors in the dining room were dirty.  The ladies room was FILTHY!  The trash cans were overflowing onto the floor.

While we may try the location on Charleston, we will not ever return to the location on Las Vegas Blvd.  Way over priced for the quality and quantity they serve."}
{"text":"Read the reviews and should've listened to the bad ones. The cornbread and koolaid was good. Service was horrible. 

When the server brought our forks, she brought a cup of hot water to rinse them off (who does that?)

We had 5 in our party, we got two cheap napkins. Asked for napkins three times? We got napkins when I went to the ladies room and got us paper towels. It's fried chicken wth are we gonna do with two napkins between 5 of us!

One of use asked for our server for her drink twice before getting it. One of us asked for refills twice ... never got a refill.

Now the food...Cornbread was good. It came 10 minutes after our meal was brought to us.  Chicken was over cooked and dry. Mac and cheese was so dry it wasn't edible,and the mashed potatoes were a'right. 

Place was way overrated with 3 stars.  Won't be back. Save your money and go to Peppermill instead. Peppermill is so worth the wait! Hang out in the lounge for amazing drinks!"}
{"text":"Tried to phone in an order.  When they finallu answered the phone I was put on hold for over 10 minutes.  I hung up and tried to call back and was hung up on. 

HOW DO YOU GIVE BAD SERVICE OVER THE  PHONE??????"}
{"text":"I was really hoping this place would be good. 30 minutes before closing, it was still pretty busy  with mostly black folks so I thought this place must be legit. Service was good and friendly. But, the food was lacking. Good food in general is a rarity and good southern food in Vegas is about as common as an oasis. 

The gravy was too damn salty. Unless you've got a major mineral deficiency and a raging salt craving to go along with it, you're gonna find the gravy they put over just about everything too salty. The meatloaf was a bit dry and hard and the flavor was smothered by the salt laden gravy. The liver was overcooked and also soaked in the gravy. The seasoning on the fried chicken was salty, too.

We got ours to go. When I got home and opened up the orders, the meatloaf and liver had two side orders each and they were both the same! Both entrees should have come with 3 sides and they should have all been different. That royally sucked. The mac & cheese was unexceptional and the cabbage was well boiled and lightly seasoned.

The fried chicken wings came with two long, oval, very dark colored waffles that were weirdly dense. I was expecting the light, fluffy, crunchy kind. They were ok with butter and syrup, but hell, styrofoam would be ok with butter and syrup.

Overall, the food and take out service was way disappointing. Again, the staff was friendly and  I was greeted with a smile, so the extra star. Otherwise, to me this is a 1-star place."}
{"text":"If you want soul food this is the place. Across from stratosphere hotel going towards downtown but on the strip.  I don't eat a lot of soul food but the pork chop dinner I ordered was delicious with green beans and mash potatoes THE FLAVOR was AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"if you want a good ho down southern meal this is your place to go! me and my friend drove 35-40 mins to get down here!! so you know it's worth it. when you first walk in you get a automatic greet, which is awesome because you don't get that just anywhere. what i love about this place is it seems like all the workers have a little accents which sets the whole mood of the place. we got to choose our seats ourselfs, which was pretty convenient. one down side is that it did take at least 15 minutes for them to actually attend to us, i had to get their attention to even order our drinks. our servers name was Relly she was overall really nice. i ordered the fried catfish with the two sides of mac and stuffing but ended up changing out the stuffing for more mac and chesse because it was just too delicious. The fish was right on the point of perfection, flakey, right texture, and crispy batter. the mac and chesse was of course amazing you can taste the homemade. my friend ordered bbq chicken, she said the chicken was flavorfull and tender but her side of potatoe salad unfortunately had way too much mustard she also stated the rice and beans were pretty average. the reason im giving this place a 4 instead of 5 is because of Relly, everything we asked seemed like a bother to her. she even commented \"are you sure thats all you need\" and laughed right after! noticing we didnt take it as a joke she said just kidding after. but still succeeded to say that comment a couple more times, it made me
feel uncomfortable asking her for anything in general. for me customer service is EVERYTHING and number one important thing. i still love the place and would definitely recommend it to friends and family."}
{"text":"Everything we had- fried chicken, greens,mac& cheese,green beans,& corn cakes were outrageous - staff is great- very welcoming & friendly. If you want real deal soul food get off the strip about 10 min & check this place out. If you have any idea what good food is you will be happy."}
{"text":"One of my buddies took me here Monday and I was impressed with the service and grub. My menu selection was the smothered chicken with sides of mac & cheese and rice & gravy. The muddy water (lemonade and iced tea) was also quenching. Oh yeah, how can I forget the tasty cornbread!"}
{"text":"Came here with my fam on Sunday! I am from NYC and was in Vegas for my son's birthday! This place is awesome! Clean, very friendly staff that greet you as soon as you walk in! We ordered the Fried Chicken, Smothered Chicken, and Ribs.. For sides we had Collard Greens, Mac and Cheese, Potato Salad, Sweet Potatoes and the Cornbread Dressing! Those corn cakes they serve before the meal are delicious, and the cornbread stuffing I could literally sleep on a bed of that at eat myself out of it with a spoon..OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The greens were a little spicy but still yummy! I washed down all of my deliciousness with 2 mason jars full of Muddy Water. (We call it Half and Half in NY) If you are in Vegas you must check this place out.. Its also next to the little white wedding chapel. Everytime I am in Vegas this spot will be a place I hit from now on."}
{"text":"Worst Customer service ever!
When we walked in we were told to sit wherever. Which would have been fine except the only empty tables were dirty. So we waited about 5 minutes for them to clean a table off. We got sat directly in the sun so we asked to move tables. Which took another 25 minutes. During that time no one took our drink orders. We finally got seated and was told that our waitress would be right over. 5 minutes later she never came so the only helpful waitress working came back and took our drink and food order. We waited and waited still no drinks. We've been waiting for 50 minutes with no drinks at this point, not even water! At this point we asked for a manager. The manager was nice and worked on getting us our food and drinks. When we were explaining the situation to the manager one of the other waitresses who had an attitude problem chimed in and said well yea they didn't get served because they kept moving around. Her attitude and comments were completely unnecessary. After the manager stepped in we finally got drinks and our food came about 15 minutes after that. The table had no silverware so we asked one of the men there for a few forks and he said wow they really didn't do anything. The food was good, but not on the same level as their other location, the black eyed peas and red beans and rice were both bland. I will say the catfish was delicious. In the end they did try to make it better by comping our drinks and giving a percentage off of the meal. The manager and the girl who ended up serving us did apologize several times for the issues we had. Unfortunately until they can get their staffing issues in order I'll stick to the Charleston location."}
{"text":"Weird thing happened to me. I was driving and there was this car accident on Charleston. People who know me understand how I get when it's car accidents...I get antsy. Plus I was thinkin of food. Mmmm salad. Something light you know. But I did smell fried food.....So while I was waiting for cars to hurry at 2 mph just to get past me I noticed this M & M Soul Food. Now I remember M & M from LA and I wondered if it was the same thing. I got retarded and drove over the median and pulled into the parking lot. Sure. It's 10:30am. I'm thinkin granola and my fat ass is getting soul food! Walking into this establishment - well it's no 4 star restaurant. It reminded me kinda like a truck stop place....Kool Aid 2.00 WTF? Well we gotta keep the Kool Aid man in Bling! 
I saw a sign. Oxtail.....then I saw another......Chicken wings and waffles. I wanted the oxtail. The savoring of oxtail - stewed for hours, falling off the bone goodness of melting meat....
(music stops) Oxtail won't be done for another hour....NOOOOoooo Christmas is ruined again.
What about pork chops? Smothered or fried. Holy crap....decisions...I ended with fried with mac and cheese and red beans and rice. Definitely some of the best fried pork chops I've ever had - with hot sauce....Mmmm It was crispy and juicy, full of flavor.
What? You think that's it? HELL NAH! I had chicken and waffles. MMMMmmm Damn not as great as Roscoe's but hell it was GOOD!
I definitely am coming back for everything else on the menu. It was just way too hot to eat some of this stuff.....Wow...Thinking about it now...
I'd like a salad."}
{"text":"This is absolutely the worst customer service experience I have ever witnessed in my life. A group of six of my friends and I went to this restaurant after hearing great reviews. We were told there would be a 20-minute wait. No problem. After about 50 minutes to an hour we were finally seated. We sat at the table for over 20 minutes and witnessed The Waitresses seating several other tables and taking their orders but still had yet to come to our table. We politely asked why I order had not been taken yet because we had already been there over an hour. The waitress had no explanation so after sitting 10 more minutes we decided to get up and leave. A different waitress came outside and caught up with us and asked us to come back and apologized for the wait so we came back and sat down again. We waited another 10 minutes and finally our orders were taken. There were seven of us so of course it was a big order. 20 minutes later the same waitress comes back to our table and slams the receipt on the table and says the cook is refusing to make your order then she walks away!!!!!! Mind you at this point it had been well over an hour and a half we were never rude the entire time except to Simply ask why are order had not been taken it. There were plenty of reasons to act ignorant and make a scene but of course we never did. For absolutely no reason they refused our service because we we asked a time in being served. This was absolutely horrible customer service I don't care how good your food is you don't treat customers that way. They need to be shut down or get new owners or take classes on customer service because there's is SHIT!!! This is supposed to be a black owned restaurant too. I'm ashamed of them."}
{"text":"Don't come for the service. Come for the food. The food is dee-lish. Everything is pretty good. I've been here a few times and have only had good service twice. If you don't mind service that's not up to par come in in but if you are a Strickland for good service, spare yourself!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to M&Ma's this past weekend and the customer service from Taschala was TERRIBLE.  We walked in and asked how long the wait was, they said 1 hour, we asked if we could order to go, they said yes, we said ok. We sat at the counter Taschala asked if we were ordering to go, we said yes, she said ok, but NEVER came back. Mind tou we were sitting at the counter so she saw us but she never took our order. After sitting at the counter for 30 minutes another waitress came and took our order. As we looked around the patrons that were ahead if us were sitting and eating and we still were waiting on our to go order. We waited for a whole hour and 15minutes,  that included ordering our food and receiving it. This makes no sense. I have never been to am establishment that took this long to feed anyone, we thought bc we ordered to go the service would be faster, but nope fooled us."}
{"text":"on my trip to vegas, my friends raved about this place so we stopped by on sunday afternoon. While the service was super friendly and the prices were great, I can't say that I was impressed at all. First they brought us the cornbread that's like a griddle cake, super thin and sweet. Not terrible but nothing special. I got the smothered fried chicken, cabbage and yams. I've never had smothered chicken and I don't know why I decided to try it that day, but I wish I had left that nasty brown gravy off of otherwise decent fried chicken. The cabbage was so bland, I couldn't even finish it. The yams were super sweet, as if they were only seasoned with white sugar. I don't think this place was terrible, like I said the customer service was prompt and friendly and the prices were very good. But the food could be better if it was seasoned better."}
{"text":"Great southern style food. You literally can't get better southern style food in Vegas. 

I sat down at lunch and had my food within five minutes of ordering. I got meatloaf with Mac & cheese and collard greens. Everything was delicious! 

Sweet tea was good too. Waitress was nice and very attentive. 

If you're looking for five star dining this isn't it, but if you're looking for delicious southern food- this is the place."}
{"text":"Like everybody else says, the food was great, the service was SLOW!!! From the time we walked in till the time we got the food was over an hour, and it wasn't crowded. We also watched other tables that arrived after us get served first. If you come here, be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Overdue review! Had M&M's right before I left Las Vegas and loved it, as usual. I had a waitress that made my meal extra great. I didn't enjoy my green beans and ordered some macaroni instead, not asking for them to be replaced, but she still noticed. I wasn't charged for the green beans on the check and the macaroni tasted even better with my fried chicken. The service here is always commendable, but sometimes you get someone that is extra attentive and friendly. Big portions and quality food!"}
{"text":"Awesome experience at M & M Soul Food. If you want a fancy place with perfect service, don't bother coming here. If however, you want to get great home style cooking at a neighborhood restaurant from a caring server, this is the spot! Best fried chicken west of the Mississippi. Sweet tea. Fried okra. Mac and cheese. Sweet potato pie. If your mouth is watering, head over to M & M."}
{"text":"I was not impressed.  My catfish tasted like some aquariums smell."}
{"text":"I was raised in the Midwest by a large group of 'soul food' cooks (Aunts, Uncles, etc)! Including a soul food restaurant that my Uncle Charles owned for 50 years. This food definately rivals Uncles wonderful slow cooking & BIG FLAVOR. Im a fan of they're tender & flavorful down home chittlins!!!! The price is a little higher, but good portion and worth it & it's on the strip and the best in town, so you've gotta keep up with the Jones! 
      The facility is clean, help is nice & attentive, I live next door to another soul food restaurant, and won't even say how bad the food & service was there. Just letting yall know, I know the difference and THIS ONE IS THE BEST IN TOWN I'VE FOUND IN MY 27 YEARS IN VEGAS!!!!"}
{"text":"I had the porkchop meal & it was hard as heck to cut into. I was able to cut a few pieces of the pork chop, but that was it. They gave me a small quantity of peach cobbler in a big plate & it was good, but the amount was very little. I had to wait 1 1/2 hours to be seated with the group that I was with. The yams were really good & tasty. I don't think I will return here. Oh & all the food they gave us was on plastic plates not in regular restaurant plates. That was upsetting. The food did not look like the pictures at all."}
{"text":"WOW! Just...WOW! 

I used to work in soul food kitchen many many many years ago and haven't found another place that could compare...until one of my co-workers recommended this place! Now I really don't think you can get any better than M & M! 

I went at about 2pm on a Wednesday. Walking in the ambience is like a real soul food kitchen...authentic! The place was full of patrons but not packed...we were at a table and promptly served. You can get full orders with 3 sides or half orders with two sides. They also have a la carte food you can purchase separately. I ordered a full plate of red snapper with collard greens, red beans and rice and yams...DELICIOUSNESS!!! I got the full order with the intention on saving some for my late night work \"lunch\"...but it was soOOoOOooOoOo good!...Saving some to go just wasn't going to happen...and I ate it...ALL! The portions are generous but it does seem a little pricey. Honestly though...everything I ate was so savory and memorable to the taste buds that I don't mind the $20 bill just for myself! My coworker ate her full plate of pork chops, mac&cheese, cabbage and smothered stuffing too!!! 

TaShara was our server...and she was AMAZING! As a matter of fact EVERYONE that worked there was AMAZING! All were attentive to your needs and you didn't have to hunt anyone down if there was an extra order of banana pudding you need to go! You can tell they love their job and care about there service here!...you don't find that kind of positivity very often in restaurants...but that's what makes this place superb!...great staff with great attitudes and DELICIOUS food!"}
{"text":"Oooh Chile..when I approached M&Ms I saw cats rolling dice and an out of control line. \"Due to the size of our party\" we were not eligible for a server. They gave us a sheet of paper and asked us to write down what we want. Bill is not here, but I'm not paying 18% to write my order and serve myself. Never again. Will update as this foolishness continues."}
{"text":"I Spent 30 on Food And 20 on rides and DID NOT GET ALL MY FOOD. Im Pissed. I Waited Outside For 30 Minutes and the restaurant was hardly occupied. I Will not be returning because the service on top of not receiving my full order is unacceptable. I Do not recommend leaving there without double and triple checking your order."}
{"text":"There's a lot to recommend.  The fried catfish and short ribs are wonderful.  The short ribs are tender, flavorful and the catfish is old school fried in cornmeal and well seasoned, not greasy.  The vegetables, except for the yams, were not great.  Not much seasoning and pretty watery (potato salad is also better left alone) but everything else we tried - rice and beans, chicken and waffles, fried chicken,  black eyed peas were all very good.  Like many family businesses, the wait staff can get overwhelmed by the crowd but they are nice, professional and sweet about helping folk make choices and the vibe of the patrons, down to the funky r&b oldies in the background, made us feel right at home."}
{"text":"Never knew I could find a soul food spot in Vegas. Until I came here! M&M is truly and really  the place to be. Tashara was very welcoming. I love the way she was able to multitask, recommend the best breakfast options. And suggested to come back for Dinner. Well me and my 2 friends did exactly that! Was not disappointed. For breakfast I ordered  the fish nuggets & grits w/ biscuits & a side of kool aid!!!! My GAWD! My soul was satisfied while listening to R&B on the over head speaker.

Dinner: Wings friend hard, collard greens, Mac n cheese. And the infamous Hotwater cornbread! YUM DE LE CREAME!! I shall return. Both times I took carry outs. 

Thanks Tashara & M&M for great service all around."}
{"text":"There are two locations. The one on Charleston has better reviews. Maybe we will try that one the next time. Well let me start by saying .... The service from Llyana is why the food was given 3 stars. Llyana was a great server! She was attentive and polite! I think we tipped her ten dollars for a 30.00 meal. It's Mississippi home cooking. I guess because I'm from Texas it wasn't good to me. I don't know. Well the corn pancake patties they give you while you wait are actually good. And the kook aid was tasty. I ordered smothered chicken, greens,mac n cheese and rice and gravy. I hated the gravy. The Mac n cheese was dry. The greens were ok. My friend ordered a half order of pork chops, cabbage, red beans and rice and yams. Her pork chop was tiny. The red beans were dry. She didn't comment on the yams. But the cabbage was decent and sweet. I'd suggest trying it for the experience but I wasn't really pleased. My brother wanted me to bring him some chitterlings. They allowed me to sample them first. But I've had better. So I told him not to waste his 20.00."}
{"text":"M & M's is the closest to home I've eaten when it comes to soul food.. I had fried catfish,  mac n cheese,  dressing, yams, hot water cornbread, and tropical punch mixed with kool aid.. The fish was fried to perfection with the perfect amount of seasoning.. The yams were a perfect combination of sweet goodness.. The dressing was perfect.. The mac n cheese, not good not bad.. The hot water cornbread was very tasty.. This review comes from a women that comes from a long line of amazing cooks and of course I'm one of them,  which means I'm pretty particular when it comes to food prepared by someone else.. In addition to the good food, the servers treated everyone with southern hospitality.. I would definitely recommend M & M's.."}
{"text":"M&M was not a bad find on our recent trip to Vegas. The fried chicken was pretty decently seasoned, the macaroni was basically boxed (I mean seriously a soul food place without baked macaroni deserves multiple stars off for that alone lol.) I ended up going here twice during the stay, the service was pretty slow after our initial order the we put out the search party for our waitress and it wasn't that busy. The worst thing about this place is the location, it's pretty much zombie central, run-down hotels around, from drunks to ppl on drugs everywhere, maybe a prostitute or two passing by and the pool next door that I starred at during my meal was just beautiful with its dark greenish/brown water, filled with baby pampers to beer bottles, not really their fault but hey it's there right?"}
{"text":"was worried about customer service from previous reviews but I didn't get that great customer service & great food lol"}
{"text":"By far this is some of the best food I've had in a long, long time! Great food, service, and prices. I got Smothered Chicken, two huge pieces of delicious fried chicken, covered with brown gravy, Collard Greens, and Red Beans & Rice for $9.99. I added Fried Green Tomatoes for an additional $4 and everything was fantastic!
The service was fast, attentive and courteous. The cafe is clean and even the music was cool - 70's R&B/Soul. I like this place so much I'm going back tomorrow to check out the breakfast menu. 
???????????????????
As promised I went back the next morning to try the Chicken & Waffles and I wasn't disappointed at all. The coffee could be a bit stronger but everything my boyfriend and I ordered was served fast, fresh, hot and delicious. The food is on no known diet, so I'll definitely eat here sparingly, but this is one of my new favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"Came here for my first taste of Chicken and Waffles.  Now, no place compares.  The waffles are amazing, the chicken is good, the ox tails melt in your mouth, the corn cakes are fought over and the kool aid is heaven.  I bring all my friends here when I'm in Vegas and everyone loves it!  Servers are friendly but I'm usually the only Asian person there which feels kinda weird. Orgasmic eye rolls every single time I'm there but too bad they seem to forget to bring me extra corn cakes when I ask :("}
{"text":"I had eaten several times at M&M before I started yelping.  I only realized today that I had never reviewed M&M.  The last time we ate here, I had the fried chicken with mac n cheese, dressing and okra.  The wife had the meatloaf with mashed potatoes, green beans and mac n cheese.  One of the things I love about M&M is that you get 3 sides with the full meals.  Of course, we had the crispy, sweet, thin cornbread pancakes.  These are great with some butter and honey.  

The chicken, as many yelpers note, is fantastic.  A textbook crispy crust reveals juicy chicken throughout.  They make it fresh, so it comes out HOT.  All of the sides are great, but the okra really stands out to me.  Maybe that's because whenever I find okra out in Vegas I get excited, but there is more to this okra.  The breading is seasoned, I don't know what with, but it adds something that other fried okra in town lacks.   The wife's meatloaf was covered in a flavorful brown gravy.  This was a moist meatloaf, not as dense as other meatloaves.  Excellent seasoning and veggies used in the meatloaf.  

I don't think you can go wrong here.  Excellent food served by friendly people.  Give it a shot."}
{"text":"Soul food gon' set my soul on fire!  For years I've passed by M&M without ever having the urge to stop and taste the cooking.  Being a fan of chicken n' waffles, I was told by a daily consumer to check the place out.  I came by on a busy Saturday afternoon and boy this place was packed and jive'n.  I ordered without hesitation the Chicken N' Waffles (which is served all day and all night long) and my party placed an order for the Smothered Fried Chicken and the Seafood Gumbo.  The joint was alive with nonstop chatter and played r&b hits from the 80's and 90's.  Our grub was served in no less than 20min.  During our wait, we were constantly bombarded with the warmest most succulent cornbread to come in contact with my tastebuds.  Despite the afternoon rush, our server was very un-rushed, attentive and kept it coming with the cornbread!  The fried chicken and waffles came out in a dish of 3 chicken wings and 2 waffles with a side of butter and syrup.  The wings were fried to saving grace perfection.  Not too salty and not too greasy either.  The waffles were soft and delicious and it seemed like they were made from the same cornbread ingredients.  My life is f'n good.  I got to take a small bite of the smothered fried
chicken which was the bomb-diggity and  finished off the left over seafood gumbo.  The gumbo was delish!  Slightly spicy and tangy.. all with a mix of okra, sausage, rice and crab legs.  The gumbo came in a large bowl and ran about $15.  Ain't nothin' better than listening to baby-making Babyface music and makin' love to my fave dish!  Ultimate food-porn!"}
{"text":"Catfish excellent...but pork chops way over cooked, canned corn, mac n cheese bland no flavor, service ok needs  improvement event waiteesss spent more time talking to co-workers and security guard then helping customers."}
{"text":"Passing by M & M Soul Food Cafe, it can easily be missed.  Good thing the BF and I have an eye out for food places all the time 'cuz we're always hungry.  From the outside, there's not much to look out.  It occupies a corner spot and after walking in, you can see tables lined up past the counter to the back.

We were told to take a seat anywhere we liked and after sliding into our booth, menus were brought over.  The waitress came by to ask if she could get us beverages and you gotta get Sweet Tea ($1.50)!  (Yum! Yum!)  

Perusing through the menu, we decided to split an order since dinner was happening in a couple of hours.  We opted for the whole order of Shorts Ribs with gravy ($17.99), which is \"slowly cooked beef ribs, seasoned to perfection with gravy or BBQ.\"  The whole orders come with three sides and our choice was the collared greens, macaroni and cheese, and fried okra.  (Check out the picture!)  A half order was available for $12.99, but  I'm not sure how many sides you get with the half orders.

The wait wasn't too long for our order to come, despite the warning on the menu saying there's a 20 minute wait for fried items.

The short ribs were tender and came off the bone easily.  It was flavorful and went well with the gravy.  The macaroni and cheese was a bit bland for my tastes though, but the collared greens fared a bit better.  The BF said they could have cooked the greens a bit longer for what he likes.  We especially liked the fried okra though.  It was my first time having that and we wished we had two orders of it instead.  

Other sides available included yams, black eyed peas, red beans and rice, potato salad, corn bread dressing, cabbage, string beans, and rice and gravy.  Entrees included oxtail, catfish, chitterlings, gumbo, meatloaf, fried chicken, and liver and onions.  Dessert choices were peach cobbler, sweet potato pie, and banana pudding.  

Service was good.  The waitress refilled our sweet tea before we had to ask and before we were even done with our first glass.  We definitely appreciate that.  She also brought out an extra plate for us so we could share our entree.  And she asked if we wanted any dessert before giving us the bill too.

Overall, the sweet tea, ribs, and fried okra were good.  The other sides were just okay.  We felt that it was a bit pricey for what we got, and both expected a larger platter of ribs.  We wouldn't mind going back to try out what else they had to offer.

Sidenote: I'm not sure if it's intimidating or not seeing this very tall man  wiping down tables as his gun and badge bounce off his hip.     

There's an 18% gratuity added for parties of six or more.

Update! 03/14/08 - The BF was craving their short ribs, so we ordered them up again.  This time they were  A  LOT more generous with their portions!  (It makes me wonder if we got shafted the last time - check it out and compare the pictures yourself!)  I wish we remembered not to get the mac n cheese, but we got black-eyed peas and fried okra this time too.

I went for the Small Seafood Gumbo which had crab (hard to eat), chunky sausage, chicken, okra, and rice.  It's pretty generous for a small portion, but there's not all that much seafood in it.  It's super gooey from all the okra 'stuff' though.  

This time we got complimentary cornbread pancakes, two each and a side of butter.  What a nice treat while you peruse the menu.  Their sweet tea tasted a bit different than before, did they change the recipe?  Overall, a better experience than the last.  I'll up it to a 3.5 from a 3 now."}
{"text":"This place is not as good as it used to be a couple of years back. The corned beef literally tastes like it came from a can and the waitress there made me feel so awkward. Normally, they ask you at a restaurant (even this place) - how do you want your eggs, what toast do you want, etc. but I got an awkward silence after I made my order until she asked \"How do you want your eggs?\" Also, she walked away after taking me and my friends orders and came back a minute later and asked what we ordered. Why didn't she just have something to write with? I don't know, it just felt so off. Maybe she didn't like me? Lol. My husband had the fried catfish breakfast and my sister had the fried chicken. Both liked their meals though. Guess it was just my bad luck."}
{"text":"OMG.. Wth did I get myself n2.. This place was Ghetto as hell.  First off took forever to get seated.  Once we were seated they took forever to take our order.  No bad intent to our waitress she had to work a million other tables.  Once our order was taken it took another 30 minutes to get out food, once we received our food all of our orders were messed up.  We received food we didn't order, food we did order came even later than our order.. WOW I'm just saying visit at your own will.  This place was a HAM.. hot a$$ mess.  I only gave it 1 stars because I had too.  One thing I hope they check YELP reviews.  This might help them hopefully be more efficient."}
{"text":"second time here, and it was lunchtime on a Friday and it was PACKED.  no breakfast menu (ugh)...but they still served waffles (yum).  so why now 3 stars?  no drink refills for 30 minutes.  food was now average.  potato salad not edible.  mac and cheese just OK (I make better at home).  waffles above average.  yada yada yada.  SUPER friendly staff still...which is such a nice thing.  excellent clientele, so the whole environment is awesome.  our waitress had an excellent sense of humor despite running around due to the place being packed.  we'll go back again the next time we're in Vegas, but just with lower expectations."}
{"text":"The service at this restaurant as Horible  !!!   We waited  45 minutes to get our food, so we got and left. The waitress are on private calls and four people after were served before us. Maybe two but not four. Go at your own risk. !!!"}
{"text":"Food was really good and the service staff was friendly and prompt. Food is well cooked and seasoned.. not the typical cafeteria bland taste. Well worth the visit. I will definitely be based on my next visit."}
{"text":"We were very excited to see a reasonably priced soul food restaurant within walking distance of our hotel and on the strip! Couldn't wait to get in and have some amazing food.

We waited for over 20 mins for a table. Sad part, there were empty tables that could of been used, but weren't. We were given menus to look at and told that by the time we get our table our food would be ready. Nope. Can't order unless you are at a table or doing take out.

Once seated, we still had to wait almost another 20 mins for food. The menu doesn't accurately describe half size. Menu says that half size mean 2 side orders instead of 3. We ordered a half plate of catfish. We got 1 piece of fish. The two sides... one that we chose was out, but we weren't told until they brought our food out. Disappointing considering how long we waited to eat and that was one of the main things we wanted.

The food is alright. Mac and cheese is VERY GOOD. The catfish was on point. Their cornbread looks like small pancakes, but is pretty good too. The seasoning was hit or miss. Some things were great and some, not so much. The kool-aid, yes they have kool-aid on their menu, was soooooooo good!

Our waitress was pretty cool. She worked her tail off. I think her name was Skylar. From the moment we walked in, until we left, she was on the go and always very friendly. I loved her energy.

If it weren't for the long wait for a table, with multiple tables open I would of given 4 stars. The food isn't 5 star, but close. If you choose to come here, don't be HUNGRY as you have no idea how long you will have to wait for a table. The taste is close to southern cooking, if they tweak the seasoning a little on a few items it will be out of this world amazing! I may come back in the future..."}
{"text":"If I could give it more stars, I would. No doubt the BEST SOUL FOOD IN VEGAS!!! The only thing better than the food (seriously, get anything on the menu, it'll be fantastic) is the top notch service and great attitudes of the wait staff. I am in Vegas at least three or four times a year and eat at this place every time I come. More than once. If you like delicious soul food and excellent service, get your ass off of the strip for once and support this great family owned restaurant. Seriously, go there. Now."}
{"text":"Very delicious food! This was the first time for me to try soul food, and I am glad I did! Came here on a Sunday with a friend, and the place was surprisingly not too busy. Got a decent amount of customers. We ordered a full size of oxtail and gumbo, plus fried green tomatoes as an appetizer and several sides. The corn bread was made in the form of pancakes, and it was very light and delicious. The food was amazing! Oxtail was very soft and the gumbo had great flavor. A very good experience, only thing is, service can be hit or missed. Drinks went unrefilled several times and we had to ask for the check."}
{"text":"Great food and service!  Stephanie was our awesome server!  
Fried chicken and waffles were fantastic!  
They also bring you complimentary pancakes for an appetizer!  
Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't look all that much on the outside but the inside is very nice and cozy.  Came here with some friends for lunch and we ordered the fried chicken of course.  I got the smothered fried chicken but asked for the gravy on the side and picked green beans and collard greens as my sides.  My friends pretty much ordered the same things but just asked for different sides including yams and fried okra.

The reason I gave this place 3 stars is because the flavor profile is off for certain dishes.

The complimentary corn bread they served was sour.  That's right, sour instead of sweet cornbread.  I've never had sour cornbread before and didn't care for it.

I was super happy that I asked for gravy on the side because the gravy tasted exactly like the ones you make at home from powder.  Does not taste god at all!  The fried chicken was delicious though.  I ordered the dark meat and it was juicy!  The chicken itself was decently spiced but I wouldn't say it was packed with flavor.  But I didn't mind because the skin was crispy and the meat was moist.  

The collard greens are sweet.  Is that normal?  I've never had it that way but I thought it was kind of weird.

The yams.. basically like eating sugar.  SOO SWEET.  It was good but one piece was enough for me.  It was my dessert actually.

The fried okra was delicious!  I would totally order that next time.  The green beans were ok.  Very mushy and looked like it was from a can.  

Overall I would come back again and I will be smarter about what I order."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best soul food I have ever tasted at a restaurant!

For starters, they serve cornbread pancakes. A unique offering and they were quite tasty. We had the links and chicken wings as appetizers. The links were okay and the chicken wings were good.

The muddy water drinks were awesome (according to my husband, I had water).

For the main entrees, we had the fried chicken. It was perfect. Seasoned just right, juicy, and not greasy. For the sides, we had the mac and cheese - perfect, not heavy; yams - great, not too sweet, melt in your mouth fabulous; greens - cooked just right, not over cooked or salty. 

Note - The hubby got the chicken smothered in gravy. He loved it, but I did not care for the gravy at all. 

The desserts were wonderful as well. We had the banana pudding (yummy goodness) and the sweet potato pie. 

It was an extremely busy day when we visited, and a bit chaotic, but the service was still awesome. Our waitress was very nice and made sure we were well taken care of.

Great job M&M!"}
{"text":"Went on 1/12/16 with the boyfriend and we both love soul food. I saw some bad reviews about the service but the visit today was excellent. The staff was very friendly and they welcomed us very warmly just like souther hospitality is known for. We came during breakfast hours and I got the chicken fried steak that came with two biscuits and potatoes, ordered the grits on the side. It was AMAZING. The batter was crisp, meat was very juicy and tender. Potatoes were on point and seasoning was great! The biscuits were so fluffy and soft and oh so buttery. Even the grits were hot and very fresh. Best chicken fried steak I've ever had. He got the chicken and waffles and he got three good size wings very crispy and seasoned. Waffles were Long shaped and very good looking. It was little crisp on the outside and fluffy in the inside and it was perfect. Overall, the food was amazing, fresh, home made and authentic to their southern roots. The drinks came in cute mason jars. The presentation here is excellent. Also it is a huge restaurant. Service was over the top. She was fast, filled up our drinks often and she was so cute and nice! Will go back every time in we are back in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Took 40 minutes for our food to come. All but one of the waitresses are unprofessional and ratchet. One of the waitresses screamed in the restaurant \"who ordered this?\" Are you kidding me? This is exactly why black businesses cannot do well. The cook and the waitress were having a full on argument in the restaurant because they were running out of food.The level of professionalism and timeliness is astounding. Whoever owns this place needs to do something because there have been issues here for YEARS. Save yourself your time and money and don't come here."}
{"text":"We were there on New Years Day for a \"traditional New Years Dinner\".  
It was great.  We had to wait 30 min for a table because it was so busy, but the staff was very nice about it.  And it was worth the wait.  
I had the catfish with red beans and rice.  Their cornbread is pancake style, which surprises some people."}
{"text":"As a southern boy livin' in Vegas, I've been looking for a place like MMSF for 6 months.   Great food, and the staff were so attentive and nice.  I took a bite of the cornbread and almost fell off my stool.  Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Being raised in the south, I usually avoid soul food restaurants. Which is what I should have done in this case. But instead I took the 4 star reviews and went with it. Sitting in the restaurant I witnessed about 3 people return different sides for reasons unbeknownst to me. I should've ran then... It was apparent the greens and yams came from a can. The mac & cheese was dry and not cheesy. The dressing was a ball of cornbread with gravy on top. Thanks to the BBQ on my baked chicken because that was the only flavor it had. My cousin had catfish and it has probably the better piece of food on the plate. The sweet potato pie was lumpy, the peach cobbler was watery... Stay away if you want REAL FOOD from the soul because all this from the can."}
{"text":"Solid 4 on this one for me. Let me start with the service. My server was Angie and I also interacted with Pearl. Both of which were very friendly and helpful. The service was prompt and I was able to sit down eat and go making me only gone from the office for about 40 minutes. This is definitely a perk for lunch during the week. The food was pretty good. I am from the south, home of soul food and I must say that the macaroni and cheese and fried okra are very good. I had the meat loaf, which was good but a little tough (I think this is what caused me to go with 4 stars instead of five). Other than that it was a great experience I will definitely return."}
{"text":"My goodness greasy, burn yo finger chicken. 

These are the kinds of places I miss from LA. Over there, the food was proper and the hospitality is abundant....it's been a long time, but frankly my broken ass self can't add hypertension to the list of issues so it's a real treat to get some Southern comfort. 

I'm with everyone that the cornbread pancakes are love. I've had these once as a cornbread pigs in a blanket in a southern mommas home. These were better. It's nothing crazy creative, but it's simple goodness comfort at it's finest. 

I had a white meat fried chicken plate with red beans and rice and collard greens. The chicken was juicy and I think the seasoning was good...slightly more salty than I normally like, but I'm not big on salt. Once I dipped in a side of gravy and hot sauce though, it was all good. Muddy water to wash it down was perfect. Red beans and rice is basic and decent, collard greens were decent. 

BF got the chicken and waffles. The waffles were interesting since they were shaped like a hot dog bun and the batter was a cinnamon batter. We thought the waffle was good alone, but that the sweet waffle got a bit too much after a while. I prefer plain waffles with chicken. I want to get these waffles for breakfast though.

We brought the BF's mom and grandma and they had a chicken plate and meatloaf. Both were very happy with it and it got the approval that they said there will be a \"next time\". The BF would like to say that he feels this is the best chicken he's had and that he wants the 5 star bump. Both his mom and he would like to add that neither are fried chicken people, but enjoyed it enough that they'd both want the chicken again. 

I'm saying this is good, solid fare, but it's not the absolute best Mississippi cooking I've had.....but I'd have to fly out to go get to my favorite food spot though. I felt the food after, but that isn't their fault my busted self indulged in fatty chicken and salts. Worth it though- drinking plenty of water to flush it out. 4 stars for the food.

With me, the 5 star bump is definitely because of the staff. We walked in and the owner greeted us enthusiastically. Our server was sweet and our service was attentive. Our server even offered to pull me up a to-go muddy water since everyone was finished with foods, but I was still thirsty and took just a gulp to finish it off.  When our plates came except the BF's, the owner noticed and went up to the window to check up on the kitchen and promptly brought out his order. Gotta appreciate an owner who has a hand in the smooth operation. And speaking of the line, it's crazy how they kick it old school without any tickets and call out the order- the kitchen doesn't mess up orders much either. Food never sits longer than a few seconds on the pass so food is hot and fresh for everyone. Sure, it takes a while to get some foods, but it was busy and everything is fried up fresh. I'd be worried if it didn't take a moment to make since everything should be fresh....I think we're so used to fast foods that most people might think it's a long wait. 

Won't slap our mommas, but we'll bring em back!"}
{"text":"There was no host to seat or place guests on a waiting list. We had to stop a waitress to know how the seating was done ( seat yourself or wait for seating). Only 2 staff members whom where very busy took the time to seat us after 20min of waiting in a half full half emptied restaurant. Ash and Yana the waitresses were great n attentive. Staff is friendly. The food was good for Vegas but not for Mississippi which I was raised on. Price for the food was good. I would definitely tell the owners to get a mandatory host at the door. Please stop cooking can foods ( yams/greens) the soul food culture can definitely tell canned from frozen. I would have given a 5 star review but having no welcoming individual at the door, serving canned foods, and the restaurant attire needs a better look. It's a soul food restaurant no soul look added."}
{"text":"Started out with the cornbread pancakes. It was delicious even without butter to spread on it. The oxtail was very tender and the gravy was a great pairing.  The fried okra was delicious and of course the collard greens, yummy.  The service was excellent and the staff was very friendly. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"First of all, this is the exact kind of place that is difficult to find in Vegas.  It has that diner type feel, but with much better atmosphere.  Plus there is a age to the place makes is so rare in most places in Vegas, that feeling of history, but without any pretension.  The place was busy, and everyone was happy and eating.  The service was great.  The food was great.  The oxtail was amazing.  My wife thought her catfish might be the best she has ever had.  I could not stop eating the fried okra.  The gravy is amazing.  The only slight fault I could find was that some of the sides seemed a little under seasoned, but they do have salt on these tables."}
{"text":"Service was exceptionally bad! We waited fifteen minutes to be seated with plenty of open tables. Food was mediocre. Found a hair in my food and server didn't offer to do anything to make it right (not even replace the food) until I complained, and eventually the meal was removed from the bill. Seemed like a great idea at the time, never again."}
{"text":"Can I get some red Kooooool-aade!? 

Parking is conveniently located at both enterences. There's plenty.

Walked in this bad boy and was greeted by everyone. It's a seat yourself establishment, but if you do look lost, the servers will be glad to seat you. We came during lunch, they were busy, but found seating right away. 

Ordered:
2 half chicken dinners
Sides:
Fried ocra
Cabbage
Potatoe salad
Greens
Kool aid \"mad saaweet\"
Complimentary  cornbread pancakes were served to us right after the order was pit in. And then like that \"tah daaaah\", our meal is served. Our server had the most colorful personality. Giving the experience that special touch. Even got a recommendation to a hair stylist. 

OH Kaye! So why the 3 star you say? Same reason our fellow Elite member Philip felt, \"Chicken was only mediocre\". The chicken seasoning waas tasty, but the meat was dry. We expected at least greasy \"lol\", cause it's soulfood cuh.. haha.. it's fine though. A bit on the expensive end for less than KFC grade cooking, but an awesome sit down experience because of our superstar server. 

Will come back to try something different, maybe some chit-lings.. ha. Well, maybe not me, my wife has the iron stomach. I'll have to settle for some ribs.

It's worth the second trip, just not anytime soon."}
{"text":"First time here, was greeted and told I could sit where I would like. That was it for yhe friendly Ness, I had to ask a server for a menu, my regular server finally came to ask if was ready to order and I said it was my first time here. She didn't offer any suggestions or help on the menu, she just said  I'll give you a few more minutes. After I figured out the menu she took my order, after getting my food she never once checked on me or asked me how everything was. All in all service was horrible, food was okay. I ordered the full order of breaded snapper which came with three sides. Not sure yet if I'll go back though. The two stars is for the food, the service gets 0  star"}
{"text":"Where else can you go for fresh home made fried chicken, mac and cheese and amazing sweet potato!! Wash it down with good ol red Kool Aid :)
Great freshly made food, fantastic friendly service."}
{"text":"Pure heaven because I found a great place for Snapper in Vegas. And the peach cobbler portion was just out of this world and I loved it! Red beans & rice and potato salad were the perfect sides to the fish."}
{"text":"It doesn't get better than M&Ms!

Best fried chicken Ive ever had.
Worlds best gravy.
Sides to slap yo momma for!
Kool-Aid
Friendly service
Good prices.

I wish they'd let me move in."}
{"text":"First, a disclaimer: this review is PURELY for the chicken and waffles. 

DELICIOUS!

Look. I first tried it on a Saturday morning. The waffles come out, two of them, unusual in that the mold they use is not the standard \"round\" one but more of a hotdog bun shape- and light, tender and fluffy, piping hot. 

The chicken... it was three massive wings piping hot. When we bit into them they fair EXPLODED with juiciness and chicken deliciousness. Crisp on the outside, teeming with seasonings and flavor, and it was just all done SO well. 

Reason I felt I had to put a review out there was that I finally got to try Roscoe's- not in LA but in Long Beach. Same chain though, right? I was ready for them to blow M&M's away due to all the hype, but was I disappointed. There was no comparing the wings (sadly small and a little dry) compared to the wings at M&M's. Well seasoned, but dry. Waffles were the standard round shape and had a charming cinnamon aspect to them. They were delicious, but the difference in quality of fried chicken really brought M&M's forward in the race. 

The verdict? I'm just glad we in Las Vegas can enjoy TRULY delicious Chicken and Waffles.. without having to venture outside Sin City :)"}
{"text":"I walked in with my taste buds excited, ready to have some fine southern food like my grandma use to make. I Walked out highly disappointed. I ordered a half order of fried chicken, ox tails with Mac and cheese, greens, yams, sweet potato pie and a muddy water . The ox tails were very meaty but tough with no seasoning, the greens were dry and tasteless, the Mac and cheese was okay but tasted as though it was reheated, the yams, muddy water and my sweet potato pie was the only thing on point. My husband had meatloaf, hotlinks, mashed potatoes, potato salad, red beans and rice, and peach cobbler. Needless to say, it wasn't just my taste buds he didn't like anything either. It was all dry with no seasoning, except the peach cobbler. M and M took the soul out of soul food for me. It may be just because my grandma was a real cook from Louisiana, so I know what real soul food taste like. When I get back home, I going to have to dig up some of my grandmas recipes and help them out, I would only come here for desserts in the future. I gave it two starts because they had very good customer service."}
{"text":"POSITIVE
cornbread pancakes
family diner atmosphere
good service
great chicken
great sides
great food

NEGATIVE
limited hours, could be a great late night spot

WILL I RETURN?
definitely"}
{"text":"I ordered the fried chicken with greens and mac and cheese. They had the best fried chicken! Super crispy and flakey. My only complaint is about their hot sauce dispensers. That sauce comes out ridiculously slow.  My arm almost fell off, lol. I will definitely go back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Always so polite and food is always on point!! Busy at times so plan ahead or order take out"}
{"text":"I hated it. For a restaurant that gets as much hype as it does, I would expect better. I grew up in a southern household, and my grandmother can cook this better. The red beans and rice had no flavor, the meatloaf was dry even though it was drenched in gravy and the fried okra was over cooked and clump together. I had the catfish that was undercooked, the greens were OK, and my grandmother can make better mac and cheese. For dessert we decided to take the sweet potato pie and the banana pudding to go. I took a bite of each later in the evening, and gave them to my kids. Both of my kids said that it was OK, and that I can make both the sweet potato pie and banana pudding 10x better. The only thing that was good, was the red kool aid, and the sweet tea. Even the service was bad. I will not go back. if I want soul food, I will make it myself..and I'm white."}
{"text":"The waffles, OMG the waffles...what do they do to the waffles? Hands down the best waffles I have EVER had. Chicken and waffle sure ain't awful. Are those really chicken wings? I dunno, they're big enough to be turkey wings. O.K. not quite, but you get the point. The comped cornbread is also nothing short of magic. When I'm dead, I want to rest my head on a bed of their cornbread. Fried chicken, it's kickin', rib stickin', and finger lickin', on the menu it's what I'm usually pickin'. Light and crispy on the outside, well seasoned, and moist n' juicy inside. This stuff hasn't been sitting under a heat lamp. Smothered? Yes please, on the side, the gravy is groovy. Go ahead, pour a little of that hot sauce on the greens and fried okra blanketed in a light corn meal exterior. Everyone is welcomed with a friendly greeting the moment they step foot in the door. Heck the last time I was here I was greeted after I walked out of the restroom. Solid down home cooking served with a consistently friendly staff. Power 88.1 thumping at a level just high enough to add a little energy to the room, but not too loud for a conversation. Breakfast for 5 bucks, 2 piece fried chicken with 2 sides 9.99. Chicken wings and waffles were around 7.50 or so. Fresh brewed tea? Sure. Regular, and sweet tea. If you lookin' for  no frills down home cookin', stop lookin' and get bookin' to M & M."}
{"text":"I've been eyeing this place for some time and tonight was the night. Was looking forward to it. 

One other time I ate at a \"soul food\" place in Tacoma and was amazed at the flavors and options. (Service there was also incredibly slow lol...must be a soul food tradition)

M&m was a real let down. The gravy was good. I'm guessing it has to be....

Before I get to the food, the atmosphere and people watching here was quite entertaining. Waitress was super friendly though never got water or a refill on my muddy water. 

Salt seems to be a popular seasoning here. 
The cornbread dressing tasted just like stove tops variety and the chicken had an over cooked taste. Fried okra needed a dipping sauce. The beans and rice were tasty as was the corn cake."}
{"text":"This place was recommend by a coworker so of course we were obligated to try it:) based on others reviews we were skeptical but they all knocked them mainly for their service. We did not experience what others experienced but I can understand the comments about the long wait. We waited about 15 min from time we ordered so not bad but it seem the waitstaff was understaff as the placed need cleaning and there was only 2 waitresses working the tables. 
 The food was hit and miss my meatloaf was dry but the chicken was good. Mac and cheese and the flat cornbread was the very good. Collard greens were ok nothing special. The peach cobbler was more of a peach soup.  Overall so so could have been better but not the worst. I have to point out that this is the second time we have ordered peach cobbler and it has been peach soup so don't know if this is a local thing or not."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch around 1:30 pm with a friend. I ordered a half order or fried chicken (thigh and legg) and 2 sides (collard greens and rice with gravy). My server warned us that the food was going to take about 20 minutes. 
It took about 10 minutes to get my food. 
I seriously had such a hard time slowing down when I was eating. Everything was sooooo fricken delicious!! 
I even got a peach cobbler with ice cream on top."}
{"text":"This food is great!!! I had pork chop, cabbage, and dressing it was so good. The service is great!!! If I lived close I'd probably be there 4 out of 7 days.."}
{"text":"I found this to be a legit and great place to get some Soul Food at a reasonable price on the North end of the Strip. 

I gave it four stars because it's a new spot and the service has room for improvement which varies by server. However, what they may have lacked in running perfectly smoothly was made up with friendly, attentive service. 

It's a place I would recommend for anyone looking for some Soul Food west of the Mississippi. 

The cornbread pancakes are outstanding and come with every meal order. 

The catfish was great and they serve breakfast too."}
{"text":"Excellent! The food was prepared by someone who cared. Bless the hands of the cook! Everything was hot and packed with flavor"}
{"text":"M&M Soul Food was a great spot to get lunch.  While I ate, both I and my girlfriend remarked on how \"not Vegas\" this place made us feel.  I was reminded of being in Long Beach, specifically Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles.  The items on the lunch menu offer something for everyone.  I tried the smothered chicken, with sides of collard greens, yams, and mashed potatoes.  Everything was delicious, although my chicken did taste a little too salty.  
The service staff was amazing, and super friendly.  I look forward to trying their breakfast menu items soon."}
{"text":"Great food I did not expect the food to be this good. I've been to Roscoe's and Sweetie Pies and this small whole in the Wall was by far the best commercial soul food I've tasted. To bad there isn't one near Coachella"}
{"text":"The food was amazing but it took forever and a day to get our food. Almost 2 hours. I'll return but not on an empty stomach."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my food and so did my mom. I had ordered chitterlings, cabbage and yams. My mother ordered the Full fried chicken dinner meal with greens and red beans and rice. We shared an serving of fried okra. 

Let me start by saying that was some of the best fried okra I have ever had. It was extremely tasty, and me and my mom made short work of it.  My mother enjoyed everything she ordered only stating that the sides of red beans and rice and the greens could have been hotter.  They were like lukewarm. Which brings me to my food. The chitterlings were delicious. I normally don't eat them, but I wanted something different. Nothing else caught my eye. The yams were very delicious as well, they seemed to be fresh to me and not canned. The cabbage on the other hand was warm, and bland. They didn't really have any flavor to me. I was extremely disappointed in that fact because I've been waiting some cabbage.  

Anyways, I enjoyed my meal and I like the set up of the restaurant. Also, we had a great waitress who's name slips my mind. Great service.  I just wish the side dishes were a little hotter."}
{"text":"My last visit to M&M was the worst dining experience I've ever had. Our booth table was sticky and gritty on top and riddled with old dried gum on the underside.  The water that was brought to us was cloudy.

Worst of all was an area in the back of their dining room that is set off for preparing drinks and such. Usually it seems it's behind a partition, like an office cubicle. But on this day the wall was missing and several large, damp, smelly, uncovered trash cans were brought out and set down. In the middle of the floor. Of the dining area. Where people were eating.

Then our booth seating started to come apart. I'm not making this up, it came unattached in the corner curve of the seat and started to slide out while we were sitting in it.

Our food, when it was brought out, was the restaurant's usual quality. I used to love their water cakes most of all - cornbread served as pancakes. But by this time we didn't want to stay and eat it.

Later that day I found them listed in recent Restaurant Reports in the good old Review-Journal. The most recent one found M&M's with only a few demerits and upgraded to an A. The original report a few weeks before that had so many demerits they were two points shy of immediate closure. I'm certain that if the inspector had showed up on the day I was there, they would've been shut down right away.

If I could give a zero star review, I would."}
{"text":"Pearl was a great server my husband and I were very pleased . The food was slamming !! Great soul food"}
{"text":"this restaurant is amazing the food is awesome and the staff is super friendly they seem like a family i loved it the fried chicken baked chicken liver and onions were so darn good my server ash was super sweet and the owner is tim a great smile and very friendly"}
{"text":"There are some things on the menu - such as chitterlings - that even our African American waiter gave a gagging expression and paused when we asked about.  (He told us that he had never eaten chitterlings.)

However, the beef short ribs and baked full chicken that we did have, were decent - the chicken better than the short ribs, but neither special.  I think perhaps that the simpler dishes like fried chicken would be good.

In all, we weren't that impressed, other than with the good service and friendliness of our waiter."}
{"text":"This is always our first stop when reaching Vegas from Oakland the home of the NBA champs.(Incase you forgot) Now back to M&M the short ribs are my favite Mac & Cheese and Yams and yes the Greens. The love of my life always and I mean always get the  Smothered Chicken over rice with Mac,,She never eat's it all but love it.

If you like io eat this is the place"}
{"text":"Wow I'm handing out 5 stars like candy on this Vegas eat tour! Lol oooooh the catfish was so tender & lightly fried. The chicken fried to perfection! The collard greens, red beans & rice, Mac & cheese, sweet potatoes, & the hoecakes (I have to tell you about them separately) all are must have. If you remember kool-aid in a mason jar this place will bring back the food in big mama's kitchen. OK now back to the hoecakes lol they bring them out just to sit on the table but I promise you they will only be there 5 seconds or less! Hot, buttery & irresistible!! Another knotch on the Vegas belt!!"}
{"text":"Those cornbread pancakes are sooooo good! Those alone are worth making the drive here! 
Went in today with a party of 8 and basically everything is delicious. Their smothered chicken was really good. It came with 2 sides, I chose cabbage and collard greens, tried to go healthier since I'm already eating something fried and smothered in gravy. I got to try their yams, it's another must order. 
Angie was our server and she did an amazing job :)
Definitely going to visit again soon ~"}
{"text":"Omg horrible horrible horrible.  I use to love this place even when others frowned about it. The only reason i gave it 2 stars was because jennifer the young lady who took my order was very nice over the phone... i called someone answered i said hello and they said hello and hung up on me than i called back and got jennifer. I called at 330 arrived at about 345 line was out the door. They wouldn't let people in because he had to keep the area clear, they took small dixie cup water to them standing outside. I waited for my order that i didnt get till 358. Now the food part yuck disgusting I don't know what happened to them. I got smothered chicken it was dry. My mac and cheese was dry tasteless my poor yams was hard and flavorless and my rice and gravey. Smh the rice was beyond hard and the gravy had no salt. I give up i will never go back. It definitely was $20 wasted. ALLBAD.COM"}
{"text":"Cornbread pancakes buy you big stars in this Southern girl's heart, especially when they are sweet, thin and served piping hot. Another Mom adventure ended with me in a booth at M&M. She said she wanted vegetables, so I knew she meant mushy items that appeared to have been vegetables at some point before they were cooked beyond recognition with a piece of pork, i.e. Southern vegetables. It may sound as if I am saying something bad about Southern style vegetables, but I am not. I love Southern food. I didn't even realize you could steam a vegetable until after I graduated from college, and I turned out okay. 

The ambiance is like Mel's Diner from Alice. The booths sag a little, but if you scoot all the way over, you won't even notice. 

The service was all smiles, and when she asked if we wanted cornbread, we said, \"Yes,\" but we were not prepared for the goodness that landed on the table. We were expecting little rectangles or maybe a wedge, so when the pancakes arrived we were a little confused (I had never seen a cornbread pancake!), until we took a bite and became insanely happy. Honestly, they could have brought Meow Mix to the table after those pancakes, and I would have been just fine. I think I ate my first serving of cornbread in under one minute. You better believe we came home with some pancakes for the fridge.

My mom and I both had vegetable plates. The fried okra was good, but I must say the steamed cabbage and cornbread dressing were not the best. I can definitely steam up cabbage more to my liking at home, and I should have skipped the cornbread dressing to save room for the pancakes. Lesson learned. I have to go back to try some other things. (Okay, you're right. I am just going back to hoard the pancakes. I wonder if I can freeze them... )"}
{"text":"The food has changed.  A year ago the food was excellent however now it was mediocre.  The macaroni tasted like seasoning salt and pepper.  The dressing tasted like jiffy mix crumbles and lacked flavor. The liver was no longer breaded. They ran out of food.  The staff was kind however I noticed that they began turning ppl away at 810p when the restaurant closes at nine. I do appreciate the freshness of the food however something has changed drastically."}
{"text":"Fried Chicken, mashed potatoes AND stuffing? You can't go wrong with this place! We brought my mom here for a late Mother's Day dinner.  All she wanted was liver!!!  She was adamant that I call in advance to ensure that they were not sold out!?  So to appease her I called to make sure.  The gal that answered the phone could not be any nicer!  She was actually quite funny.  She said yes, we always have liver.  I asked if they had green salad and she laughed and said \"nothing healthy\".  I said, nothing healthy? She said nothing healthy all comfort, girl!  

We arrived at 6:00 and were promptly seated.  With in a minute or 2 some hot corn cakes were brought to the table.  We ordered our drinks and happily ate our little treat.  They tasted great!  We ordered some water and some muddy water.  Muddy water is iced tea and lemonade.  It was better than any Arnold Palmer I've ever had.

Mom got her half order of liver as did dad.  Both loved it!  Cesar Q ordered the full order of smothered fried chicken and said it was really good.  I had the half order of fried chicken and while it was tasty, my all white meat order was rather dry.  I was a little disappointed thus the 4 stars.  The side orders were all great!  The mashed potatoes and gravy were tasty and homemade.  Mac and cheese was baked and so so good.  The stuffing was just perfect and the red beans and rice..oh my!  The collard greens were the only side that we felt wasn't the best.  But I think that was just our taste buds.

The service was friendly and efficient.  As we sat more and more people came in.  We left a little after 7 and the place was packed! We will be back to give this old school Mississippi diner another go round!"}
{"text":"great food great hospitality a true taste of soul. A Vegas must eat. best fried chicken in the city."}
{"text":"This place may take the medal for the best soul food in Las Vegas. 

The inside is pretty small but they turn tables over fairly quick. 

Right when you sit down, they hand you corn bread which has a sweet taste to it- amazing. 

You 100% should order the fried catfish plate. The catfish is sooo juicy and tender. And the breading is great. So so good!! For the sides, the yams are probably the best I've ever had. Plus the collards and Mac n cheese. 

Haven't tried the dessert here but I can only image!"}
{"text":"I will never  eat there again  they food wasn't  hot dry chicken  hard bitter taste dressing was dry nasty  mac n cheese  Gross I have never seen pancakes serve with your food no corn bread  they portions are small for the price I didn't  eat it i took it to go it went right in the  trash can potato  salad  trash not wasn't good but that muddy  water and cool aid"}
{"text":"Sooooo glad I went to the Charleston location. The food was incredible, and the service was amazing. Everything from the chitterlings to the smothered pork chop to the fish was well seasoned and cooked perfectly. It was a great experience and worth the drive!!!"}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast today, I ordered the liver and onions, two eggs, hash-browns and Home biscuit plus a Diet Coke...my total came to eight dollars. Awesome food! you don't find too many places that serve liver and onions anymore."}
{"text":"Service was good. Just dont get the fish. It was hard and very fishy we did wait about a half an hour to get our food. But that was fine they were busy. The only reason I am giving this 3 stars is because my boyfriend had the chicken and waffles and they were awesome. So I will go back but I will just be ordering the chicken and waffles. There sweet tea was good to."}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Las Vegas, some friends wanted to try this place. It was further backed up by the valet at our hotel saying, \"M & M Soul Food had the best 'greens EVER.\" AND then our car driver to the location also verified this place by saying, \"The chicken wings and waffles are the best he's ever had.\"

So, along we went. our driver was good enough to give us his cell number to get a ride back to our hotel. M & M is a bit out of the way for hotel tourists. It's about 1 to 1-1/2 miles further west than the Outdoor Premium outlets on W. Charleston Blvd.

There were four of us and we tried the fried chicken (Dark and White meat), and Ox Tail, we also had a side of Pork Chops (one fried and one with gravy) and the waffles.

Each full order (around $13) comes with your choice of 3-sides. The half orders (around $10) come with 2-sides. I can't remember all the choices of sides, but some are: red beans and rice, collard greens, string beans, yams, mac and cheese, fried okra rice and gravy...  We tried almost all the sides and the Greens are very very tasty, but all the other sides were good too...

You can get the Wings and waffles all day long, but breakfast is only served till 11:00 am, so if you want eggs and grits, you gotta come early.

Oh, and their version of the Arnold Palmer is called, \"Muddy water\"... just a hint.

Enjoy and happy eating!"}
{"text":"The service was a little slow,  but we DID get there almost an hour before the closed,  and they were hurrying people out when it was closing time...LOL!  It's all good. I didn't like the cabbage I had, no flavor blah. Overall, it was ok.  The bathrooms needed a little TLC..."}
{"text":"Writing this review as I sit in the ihop across the street from this place, I originally was coming here but noticed it across the way so I went, I got there and pretty much stood there unspoken to for about 10 mins, I the. Began to chat with two other customers who were already waiting and stated that they had been there for 15 mins, unspoken to but I still did not give up hope. Not long after a guy throws two menus on the table and says nothing ... the girl who was there already asked an employee if anyone was taking orders at the take out table and she then signaled to another employee who already looked busy out her mind. She proceeded to alert the female worker who has Made eyes contact since I walked in the door who came over to ask if we wanted drinks. The girl next to me replied that she just wanted to order and the worker told her that it's like \"10 tickets up there\" whatever that means. They left immediately and then I after another 2 minutes ... I'll enjoy these pancakes now that I could get anywhere ! And this is my first time in Vegas ever.. wow."}

A long-term member of my Las Vegas short list I'd originally planned to visit M&M Soul Food with a friend over a year prior when the flu confined me to my hotel room and as such perhaps it should have been no surprise when it was myself suddenly facing a last minute cancellation this time around, the resulting solo visit a bit of letdown in more ways than one.  Obviously not brought up on \"Soul Food\" but raised close enough to Detroit that it played a big part in childhood memories I've since sought out, those looking for collards, chitlins, or gumbo should be aware that none are available before noon on weekends (despite the online annotated 11am,) nor is fried chicken beyond the wing (though if you ask nicely they may be able to accommodate after a substantial delay...IE, the thigh arrived with dessert,)  and moving past these inconveniences be advised that service, while friendly, is constrained - a pair of young ladies and an elderly fellow managing a capacity crowd of ~80 with wait times up to an hour during my stay.  Moving past the 'issues' and onto the food and décor suffice it to say that the interior replicates the façade and with a small kitchen at work behind makeshift walls the food arrived at an awkward pace with mixed results, particularly in the proteins where both pork chop and breast were dry and flavorless despite excellent, crispy breading while the thigh was expectedly more succulent but also far better seasoned, as if from an entirely different batch.  Speaking to the rest, mostly carbs and a pair of over easy eggs, it was in these items that M&M shined - the waffles a soft wheat batter and the 'cornbread' a pair of pan fried flapjacks needing only a touch of syrup to balance the savory notes, something neither the sweet potato pie nor the banana pudding would require at all - the former a well done classic and the second far more dense than any take on the dish I've found and all the better for it, a sort of bread pudding made with only a bit of liquid and a lot of ripe bananas juxtaposing softened nilla wafers."}
{"text":"My cousin brought me here for lunch on Thursday. I am from Texas so you know I am a little biased with my soul food as we have tons of places here. They do have the low key diner flair and I can tell there was a lot of locals and usuals here. I ordered the fried chicken which was breaded and seasoned perfectly for me. If it was spicier it would have been a plus. I got collard greens and corn bread stuffing for my sides. I think I got macaroni too but I don't remember if they offered two or three sides. I just remember thinking I should have got the mashed potatoes instead of the corn bread. I was pretty lifted coming here so I tore it up and had left overs for dinner."}
{"text":"Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles WHO?! If you like a good amount out of food on your plate... This place is for sure a place to go back for.. Maybe I'll go back tomorrow! I wanna try the catfish.. I seen someone else's order and the catfish was a huge piece! Now to what we ordered... The child's plate... Smothered fried chicken with mashed potatoes and a side of mac and cheese... The size plate was for a BIG child.. Thumbs Up! My daughter ordered the medium size plate smothered fried chicken, mac and cheese, collard greens and yams... BOMB! I ordered the Full plate smothered pork chops, Mac & Cheese and yams... HUGE AND SO WORTH IT! After packing my leftovers.. It Looked like I barely touched my food. Yams are delicious.. And the cornbread pancakes... I couldn't get enough of! Although the place is a lil small...This Mississippi soul food is a must to go to when your in Vegas!"}
{"text":"So I've been wanting shrimp and grits since I had it in Georgia a few years back so when I came to M&Ms against me judgement I ordered shrimp and grits.. When they came it had a whole lot of some type of grease floating at the top of my grits w four shrimps on top .. It had no flavor what so ever.. My husband ordered SMOTHERED fried chicken normally when I smother chicken I fry a little then put it in the gravy to smother .. What they did is fry the chicken and pour a whole bunch of gravy on top .....I'm so disappointed because I remember M& Ms in LA used to be the bomb .. This is nothing like Mississippi soul food... The shrimp and grits should not have all that grease floating on top I don't eat grease ... Will never ever come back... Our waitres Tonisha was a very good hostess ..."}
{"text":"Hands down this was the best chicken waffles I ever had. Excellent service. I wish I could add more stars"}
{"text":"Updated review. The food is still on point but the service has really gone downhill. Ordered take out dinner for the family and had to wait AN HOUR!!! That's ridiculous. If they're going to take that long the staff really needs to give the patrons a heads up. We should have walked out but we already paid."}
{"text":"Skip this locale and go to the one on Charleston instead. Ox tails were unusually bland and fatty, short ribs were tough. Which is a real shame because the Charleston location is bomb. Collard greens were extremely stalky, they didn't even take the time to cut them off the stalk. I felt like a panda chewing on bamboo! AVOID THIS LOCALE AT ALL COSTS, YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!"}

Granted I had breakfast, but can you really mess up breakfast that bad? YES!! I don't even want to try anything else from here. I've been so disappointed eating at these \"soul food\" places here in las Vegas.. Inspiring me to open my own!!"}

Was $18.99 for full order... smallest size I ever saw in my life, then I get home open it up, it looks like jambalaya then gumbo, didn't even smell like it, such a disappointment i was looking forward to some good ol seafood gumbo"}
{"text":"Was visiting Vegas for the first time and was told to visit this restaurant if I got a chance. I called my sister n law and she picked myself and a friend up from the hotel and we went. This was her first time there even though she lives here, the food was great, the service and waitress was great. I found no complaints. I had liver and onions, my friend had smothered chicken and my sister n law had fish. It all was so good, and my sister n law will be back."}
{"text":"Try this delicious food for the first time on a recent trip to Vegas for my both boyfriend and I's birthdays. He'd been before so he did advise that the food was good, but I must say that to me the food was spectacular. I literally had just about every item on their menu. Being that we were in vegas for 6 days we had the opportunity to eat here a total of 6 times! When I say that I enjoyed every meal I mean itttttttt. They have a breakfast and lunch/dinner menu. So we had plenty of choices to choose from. ALL of the sides were superb! And they even had hot water cornbread that came out before our meals (during lunch/dinner) times. I ordered the chicken & waffles, shrimp and grits, fried fish, and meatloaf (brown gravy) when there.


Good Music, pleasant staff, could of had quicker service, but I can say their staff seemed to be short. They did their best!

{"text":"This place is amazing!!!!! Best fried chicken my taste buds have ever had.

Tip: This is not a traditional restaurant with a hostess stand, you have to look for an open table. If you have a large group, then let them know exactly how many and once a table opens up, they will make sure your group gets seated so a party of 2 won't sit at a table for 6.

The servers are all friendly and welcoming. We felt like we went to a friend's relatives house for dinner. 

Recent family vacation, we stayed at Red Rock and looking to grub. We wanted fried chicken and were going to hit up Canes (chain known for chicken fingers), but we were looking for a more sit down place. We Yelped nearby spots and found M&M Soul Food with 4 stars. We went in with a party of 9, We waited about 15 - 20 mins to be seated, but that was fine because were really busy. 

After being seated we knew what we wanted after looking at the menu and with our big appetites, we ordered everything. 
Appetizers: Hot wings, sausage links.
Entrees: Gumbo, 2 full orders of Fried chicken with gravy on the side. Chicken comes with 3 side items each and Cornbread pancakes

The hot wings were made perfectly crisp with the hot sauce on the side. I prefer it this way so you can actually taste the chicken. The entree fried chicken had so much flavor and right amount of crisp. It wasn't overly breaded like other places do to get that crunch. The gravy was not too salty, too thick, or too thin. And the gumbo, oh the gumbo was filled with meat. They filled that sucker with sausage, full crab legs, and chicken. Every bite had so much meat, flavor, and deliciousness! 

If you are looking for homemade chicken with lots of flavor and taste that will melt in your mouth, then definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"I had the chittering ma, Mac and cheese , cabbage and cherry kook aid . It's was amazing !!"}
{"text":"This was the worse restaurant ever!! Service was horrible. Waiter had the worse attitude I have ever experienced. Greens were sour from vinegar. Cobbler was served cold! The wait time for food was unacceptable!!! Don't waste your time or money!! Wish I could give it a zero rating!!"}
{"text":"I am no expert on soul food, but the fried chicken is finger lickin' good. Please don't sue me, big chicken company. My sister is on this obnoxious health kick where she cringes at the mention of good food. I am from the school of eat it in moderation, so I dragged her here anyways.

What we ordered? Three piece dark meat meal and the oxtails. Like people have mentioned before, there is a disclaimer that it takes 20 minutes for fried food. We were sitting there for five minutes and got our food before people who were there before us. We were surprised, but were not worried because the food was amazing. The fried chicken was super moist, crispy, and steaming hot. My sister got a side of fried okra, green beans, and mac'n'cheese. I got yams, greens, and red beans and rice. All my sides were way better. She loved hers, but my choices were still infinitely superior. The oxtail was generously portioned and fall off the bone tender. There was so much food that we were able to pack a box to take home. I know it is bound to be a delicious snack later. 

Maybe it is good that it is farther away from where I live. I can imagine how much weight I would gain if I lived closer by."}
{"text":"WOW my son had a Basketball Tournament AAU at the end of July was invited to go to M&M's you know it's bad when you even eat the crumbs off your plate would have licked it if I were the only one their .

The staff was courteous, friendly and conversational. The service was prompt and the food was delicious....This is one of the best soulfood places that I've been to."}
{"text":"So where to begin? 
My boyfriend had been to this place several times and said it was pretty good. They only serve breakfast until 11am, so a lot of the time on his days off and late nights we woke up well after this *gotta love vegas*

We visited this establishment 8/17/2011 around 10am.  We entered through the back door, the side where the salvation army is.Plenty of booths and tables open, we waited to be sat. There were two people working ,and the place wasn't crazy busy being it was a Wednesday. An older African American man and a younger African American woman with a \"four leaf clover on her neck\". The gentleman sat us and took our drink order. We waited about 5 mins after that to place our order. In this time around 5 Asian people came in and sat in the back corner, an African American older gentleman sat at the table behind my boyfriend alone and an older African American couple sat two booths back.  no problems thus far. The woman came over and didn't even look at either of us while she took our order. She seemed like she was irritated. At the time i didn't think anything of it. I ordered turkey sausage and eggs he ordered hot links and eggs. Simple right? 
So the 5 Asian people get their food, then the gentleman alone gets his food, then the older couple gets their food. AND WE STILL HAVE NO FOOD ON THE TABLE! ITS 10:45!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Not once did anyone stop by the table and let us know if we ordered something they were out of or that our food would be out shortly.
 My boyfriend is African American and i am mixed *black and white
* *I have tan skin and light hair so most people don't know im mixed.*
I tell my boyfriend that i feel we are being discriminated against, And that i have experienced this before with my parents when i was younger. I wondered why the waitress didn't even look at us! You work for tips don't you? Arent you supposed to be nice and accommodating to your customers?!!!?!??! Its a shame that you couldn't provide proper service because you didn't appreciate the fact i was with a African American man. I could understand if one table got their food before us. But a party of 5 at one table, a party of one, and a party of two. THAT'S 8 PEOPLE THAT PLACED THEIR ORDER AFTER US! AND WE ONLY ORDERED EGGS AND SAUSAGE! THAT DOESN'T TAKE 45 MINS! 
I tell my boyfriend that i am DISGUSTED and i will not be eating anything from this place. He says he wants to ask the waitress whats going on. At this time i walk out of the place and he stays behind trying to find out whats going on.
I am in tears in the car, stomach in knots in disbelief that its almost 2012 and things like this still go on. I now appreciate my African American father and Italian Greek mother even more for the things they had to go through to be together! I never realized the society we were living in.
 I will be filing a complaint with the better business bureau today. And contacting the news to let them know about this. I had a good mind to stand on the sidewalk with a sign saying \"IF YOU ARE AN INTER-RACIAL COUPLE YOUR BUSINESS ISN'T WELCOME HERE!\"

I HOPE THE OWNER READS THIS AND TAKES MY COMPLAINT TO HEART. \"4 LEAF CLOVER LADY AS WELL\" REVERSE RACISM IS NOT RIGHT"}
{"text":"Love the fried chicken here. 

This location opened at the beginning of the year and is open til 9pm Sunday-Thursday.

Their signage isn't all that great, but its in the parking lot of the Holiday House hotel across from the Stratosphere."}
{"text":"One of the worst places I've ever been too! Very Small, unorganized, high prices for the location and place people they hire to serve are rude! Completely unprofessional should of known from the location it's located. The security guard at the front should of gave it away! Enter at your own risk!"}
{"text":"The servers were very friendly hear the atmosphere is upbeat there wasn't a lot of seating it's a pretty small dining area but nice nonetheless I had the biscuits and gravy which was made with brown gravy and I've never had it like that before but I liked it I also tried the cornflake crusted French toast which I found to be crunchy and to be a inviting new twist on French toast I also got the Louisiana style potatoes which were like skillet potatoes with bell peppers in the The potatoes delicious in my Opinion And grits Overall my experience was very good it's my second time going there and I've had the same quality service both times their portion sizes are not too big but they turn out to be about just right for me so if you haven't been there and you like soul food I would stop and give it a try"}
{"text":"Today we had a desire for some soul, food that is and so we headed to M & M soul food.  We parked on the west side and walked in and found a table right away.  We got our drink orders out of the way and began studying the menu.

Soon we notice that there was not one single table left unoccupied, it had filed up quickly.  We got our food order in and I got the smothered pork chop with sweet potatoes and greens.  I also got a side order of fried okra one of my very favorite vegetable.

The food came out slowly, but came pipping hot and down right good.  I could tell there was a lot of soul put into the food, the gravy covering my chop was rich and had a caramel color that was spot on.  The chop itself was tender and almost fell a part.  My side dishes were very fresh and just seasoned right.  A very good meal.  I guess the best time to come is right before the Sunday crowd!"}
{"text":"breakfast food

Smothered liver with onions and gravy and house biscuits and scrambled eggs was delicious and tender.

Salmon croquettes came with eggs house biscuits and potatoes were so filling and scrumptious. 

Waitress was very friendly and attentive. I recommend this place and will return."}
{"text":"Everything at M & M Soul Food lives up to its name...everything I ordered  was fresh, delicious and all the beautiful waitresses make me want to come back soon. I never saw oxtail before or fried okra. If you grew up in the south, you'll feel right at home here."}
{"text":"I love M&M's. My daughter and I come here at least once a month. And we always bring our out of town visitors to eat here too. 

I love the fried chicken, yams and dressing! The peach cobler is also delicous. If you come to Vegas and want to find something off the strip, M&M's is the place to go to. Hands down."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  I must admit...the cornbread pancakes were good but really greasy.  I also had some collard greens(LOVE), macaroni & cheese, yams (LOVE), red beans & rice, cornbread dressing (it's like stuffing) and fried okra.  Of course, we shared all of this between 4 people. We all had the fried chicken and it was very good.  I really like the seasoning and how crunchy it was.  BUT...there is a BUT...my chicken wasn't cooked all the way through.  Everyone elses was ok.  They gave me a new piece but by the time it came out I was ready for dessert.  Our waitress felt really bad so nice she gave our dessert on the house.  The hospitality, service and food was great!!!  I will definitely come back to try something different."}
{"text":"I saw all the reviews on Yelp and decided to try it out.  The food was really good. We tried the chicken and fish and was not disappointed.  The peach cobbler and most importantly the banana pudding was my favorite."}
{"text":"Yes this is real Soul Food, so yes, it is salty, and fatty, and oh so good!
They start you off with cornbread pancakes, the most fluffy, buttery little flapjacks you've ever had, and they keep them coming all throughout the meal (so you can get very full just on those!). Drinks are served in jam jars, of course, and anything other than water costs around 2-3$, including red Kool-Aid.
They have two specials : One serving of your main dish and two sides, or two servings of your main dish, and three sides.
One is enough for me, and I get the battered and fried catfish strips with fried okra, sweet potatoes, or potato salad. The fish is always right out of the frier hot (they warn that fried foods may take up to 20 minutes, so be prepared) and very crispy. They serve it with lemon and you have vinegar at the table if you need it. 
We have had three of their four desserts: Sweet Potato pie, Peach Cobbler, and the Banana Pudding. All are ridiculously yummy.
My boyfriend has had the smother fried pork chops, and the chicken and waffles, both of which he say are really amazing and filling."}
{"text":"What a complete waste of time and this is coming from a local! We tried to call the order in...no answer. But no worries we were in the neighborhood so we just decided to go in. Total disarray with no direction for take out or even dine in. Ran by under qualified management and a waitstaff with no sense of care or urgency! Finally got our order taken after waiting for 12 minutes. Waited another 20 mins only for the cook to yell from the kitchen that they were out of the item we ordered! Horrible first impression and will never be back. I will travel 15 mins up the road to Ella's for my Soul Food fix."}
{"text":"Started out shaky service not that great but the food was on point. 4stars for the food. 1 star for the service."}
{"text":"We drove by the one on Las Vegas Blvd, but the gf looked it up on yelp and said this was  the original one. So we drove to this one instead. The staff was friendly and welcoming. The food was ok, I've had better. There chicken was fried perfect, but it could have been seasoned(spiced/flavoured) a lot better. There beans and rice was cold by time it got to us. The beans were still hard and it overall lacked flavor. Same goes for the cabbage and the greens. The Mac&cheese was good and the cornbread also.  Would post pics but those were all taken on my gfs phone."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, with the exception of the green beans (possibly canned?) I recommend getting anything you order smothered. Fast friendly service! I'm definitely going back to try the gumbo as they were out of it when I attempted to place my order."}
{"text":"First, let me grab a snack because just THINKING about M & M Soul Food - makes me hungry! ----

5 STARS!

CLEAN and FRIENDLY!
The food is so seriously delicious. I went with two other people and we all ordered different entrees and 'Muddy Water\" served in a Mason Jar. MMMM! MMM! We were 'sampling' off of each others plates. Everything was sooooo good and served at just the right temperature. 

The atmosphere was pleasant with many 'first-timers' for a Saturday night. At the table next to me, I met some nice ladies from Monterrey California (near my hometown)  that heard about M & M.  

I have to say, that when I walked in I was pleasantly surprised with the warm greetings from the servers.  I really loved the pleated tuxedo white shirts and bow-ties. Nice! Very Nice!  The servers were so busy, so polite, and gave plenty of smiles for everyone. 

What I saw different at this restaurant, was how often the servers assisted each other.  I had not seen 'teamwork' like that before. I applaud their performance. 

I live on the other side of town from M & M and I'm definitely going back for more! I just need to stop telling so many people about the delicious food at this restaurant.  Next time, I get there, there will be a line outside the door to get in. 

Thank you M & M Soul Food, for not only the delicious cooking, thank you for all your thoughtfulness in making our dinner experience a pleasant evening. 

See you soon!"}
{"text":"This is my second time here in two years and I have to say nothing has changed I gave th another chance in hopes of things have change but I was sadly mustaken. I got the bbq chicken witt mac n chz cabbage & sweet potatoes.  The chicken has great flavor and tender however the sides :-(  the cabbage was flavorless in its own juice. The mac n chz was also flavorless and thiick and dry.  The yams were also soaking in its own water with sugar.  You can make soul food delicious with out adding tons of salt and sugar.  The owner needs to take the cooks to diffrent cities in the midwest and the south to train your cooks"}
{"text":"Admittedly I LOVE SOUL FOOD and my hips do too. So I was in Vegas last week and we decided to try this place on Thursday. Actually I think that it may have been Friday ( all my days run together in Vegas!) So our uber drops us off right out front around 2 pm. There is a line coming OUT of the door and the waiting area inside to the right was at capacity. As soon as we make it inside, the manager (older black man with glasses) starts hollering for us to 'CLEAR THE WALKWAY' as it is a fire hazard. Insert deep sigh. So we CLEARRRRRRRRRR the walkway and get our name on the list. Some gentlemen get up so that my friendgirl and I can sit down. 

An energetic young waiter acknowledged that it was hotter than the hinges of hell and asked if any of us that were waiting wanted water and he brought us all water. I thought that was really nice. Meanwhile, people are still falling up in here (it was Hoodie award weekend and Omega Psi Phi conclave so I expected it to be really busy) I noticed several empty tables that were empty, however it took a long time for people to be seated at those tables, not sure if that was an oversight by whomever was in charge of the floor or what was going on with that. 

As our wait nears 30 minutes, two men (I won't even refer to them as gentlemen) walk in and the manager puts their name on the list. About 3 minutes later, the manager calls a name on the list with no response. He walks away and says something to the energetic waiter that brought us the water. Then, the waiter walks over to the waiting area and says 'JONES?' Do you know that the two men that JUST PUT THEIR NAME ON THE LIST HOP UP AND GET SEATED ALL WHILE THE MANAGER JUST WATCHES FROM THE BAR AREA?!!!!!!!!!!!! WTF?!!!!!!!! Like you KNOW they just came in. I decided NOT to say anything because I know that there are some men who don't give a fcuk about disrespecting women and I didn't want to put myself in that position. SHAME ON THE MANAGEMENT FOR ALLOWING THAT TO HAPPEN. 

About 10 minutes later we were seated. By the kitchen. I was trying my BEST NOT to look in the kitchen, because if I did, I'm sure I would have lost my appetite. Waiters and waitresses blatantly ignored us for about 15 minutes. I didn't feel special though, because they were ignoring other customers that were seated by us also. Finally the waiter who brought the water earlier took our order. I got the smothered chicken, cabbage and mac and cheese and friendgirl got the smothered pork chop, mashed potatoes and collards. Food was pretty decent. Nothing to write home about though. When I go back to Vegas in a couple months I won't return simply because I don't agree with the way they run their business. Doesn't matter to me if your food is amazing, if your service is poor, it's a NO for me."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and being from Los Angeles I was excited to see it thinking I was gonna get some good soul food. The place wasn't super crowded but they made us wait outside to be called in to be seated. We waited maybe 10mins then when we were seated the service was SUPER SLOW and horrible. When we finally got our food it was cold and nasty. My fish was mainly cornmeal. Hot sauce was watered down and not hot. Welp I will NEVER come back here waste of money"}
{"text":"The food was wonderful and staff was friendly. Thumbs up to fried chicken and fried catfish."}
{"text":"Let me just tell you!!!!!!!  It was amazeballs!

As a connoisseur of THE FRIED CHICKEN, I can say.. this is one of the best I've had in a long time.  As soon as I bit into that chicken.. Cruncy, Juicy, right spices.. just perfect.  
Here's what we ordered:  Fried Chicken and Waffles, Ala Carte Fried Chicken Plate (cus we're greedy like that), Oxtail, mac n cheese, greens and Gravy over Rice.
 EVERYTHING was sooo good.  I won't go into detail.. just PUHHHLEASE trust me!!!!

Soooo.. if you are in VEGAS and you want good food with no fuss and have a LOT of SOUL... Head on down to M&M Soul Food Cafe.. You won't regret it!

This one will be permanently on my itinerary when I go to VEGAS!!!!

AMAZEBALLS!"}
{"text":"Better then the one in L.A. Unbelievable but yes Jerria was a doll, wonderful service and great food"}
{"text":"I never write reviews while sitting in the place because I want to give them a fighting chance to amaze me but this is an exception!!!! 

We walked in the door and there was no one there to greet us or take our name. A few people left so we sat down in the waiting area and some waitress walked over and asked how many in our party. She then sat us ahead of a few other parties. We then sat and waited........... 

I had to find my own menus and the waitress looked at me crazy when I reached for one. Like excuse me this is a restaurant, I need a menu to know what you offer. Then we waited some more................ 

15 min later someone walked by and handed us silver wear 

10 min after that the waitress came and said she would be right back........ Another 10 min and someone else said they would be right with us. Another 5 and we got cornbread pancakes with no butter (still no drinks). Another 10 min and we placed our drink order. Almost an hour goes by and we still haven't ordered our food. 

There is a disclaimer on the menu that it's another 20 min wait for fried food (most of the food on the menu is fried) 

10 min later we finally ordered food after I mentioned I was going to leave and go to IHOP (waitress overheard me) 

It has now been over an hour and just ordered our food. The waitress felt bad so she brought us another cornbread pancake but at this point I just want my food. But since we ordered fried food it will probably be another 20-30 min for that. 

Sigh I just wanted some soul food before we head home from an epic weekend and all we are getting so far is an epic fail of service. 

Can't review the food since I haven't eaten yet....."}
{"text":"Why is this place so loved? We've been wanting to know and finally tried them. We're from Cleveland, an old industrial town with real soul food, plus my partner cooks and comes from that tradition. 

I ordered BBQ chicken, cornbread dressing with gravy,  and mac & cheese. My partner had fried catfish, the same sides, plus potato salad, along with chitlins, since you can't find them easily. 

First, they brought out pancake-style cornbread that tasted a bit like a greased skillet.  My partner's entree arrived several minutes before mine, so I got a preview of my side dishes.  We were both surprised at the lack of seasoning. The dressing was a soft, gritty serving with no discernible flavoring other than some sage. No onion, salt, pepper- very odd.   The macaroni and cheese was somewhat hard, with congealed clumps of cheese. The potato salad was more like mashed-potato salad, the flavor wasn't horrible but it was mostly of sweet pickles. 

My BBQ chicken was a huge disappointment. Just a small, baked, drumstick and thigh with bottled sauce (it appears) poured over them. Huh? My partner's full serving of catfish was largely devoid of seasoning, although it was cooked all right. The extra $4 for the third side and half a piece of fish was not worth the price. 

The first bite of chitlins went into a napkin and were declared \"awful.\"  I'm no chitlin eater- the smell alone was making me gag, but my partner, who has both eaten and cooked them, couldn't stomach these. 

The server was pleasant but never cleared the table or asked how we liked the food. With so many great ratings maybe she didn't think it necessary to ask. We won't be coming back.   We've done this better at home for less money."}
{"text":"Fried chicken, stuffing, mac & cheese & cornbread. So delicious! Our food came out quickly and our chicken was super delicious. He gravy is amazing and the cornbread is filling! Your eyes will definitely be bigger than your stomach with the generous portions. The owner came out and thanked us for eating there. He took time to speak with my fiancé about his meal. That is pretty cool. They serve drinks in jelly jars & the wait staff were all super friendly! Perfect Friday lunch after a day of shopping! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Well, i did not like the food at this place much at all, well maybe because I'm not a huge soul food fan. Fried chicken was OK but very greasy and the oxtail was very fatty and it was deep friend and smothered with gravy didn't really taste anything special about it, it was just salty and fatty. I went to this place to try the gumbo but unfortunately it wasn't available on the day, so i might go there ones more to try that but not sure."}
{"text":"Although with the mixed reviews when I had looked into it, I figured I had to find out for myself. Word of mouth hyped it up so guessed it was worth a shot, besides I'm always up for soul food.

Pros: The Fried Chicken was very well seasoned as well as the catfish. The mac & cheese was good. The service was friendly & very efficient with refills. Order the homemade lemonade! So good. The peach cobbler was AMAZING! (Wish they had served it warm) For the ice cream they topped it with a quality brand of vanilla bean.

Cons: The cabbage lacked seasoning of any kind, I did find a minced piece of some unknown meat it was too small to determine. The greens were bland, the red beans and rice, as well as the rice & gravy was mediocre but wish that the serving size had been larger to accommodate 3 large oxtails. Now the oxtails were very VERY good! From the meat perspective but the ratio of fat to meat was a losing battle, they were so fatty! (Picture to follow).

Overall Id return, But try out the other location (better reviews) and go about my order differently."}
{"text":"The food was great but, the service was terrible. They seemed like they were in a hurry to close although we arrived at least an hour before closing. We were initially seated on one side of the restaurant but, was moved to the other side because they were trying to close down that side. That wasn't the problem. After we were moved to the other side of the restaurant, our drink order was taken but, we didn't receive the drinks. Cornbread arrived and still no drinks and No waitress to take our order. We ask for some water at that point since they did bring us something to snack on. The water never arrived. Finally, our waitress arrives and takes our drink orders again (still no drinks at this point) and our food order. Our food finally arrives but, we still do not have our drinks. Oh, I forgot to mention, the waitress smells of weed when she's taking our orders. So, we finally get our drinks and most of our food has arrived. My son has no food. My daughter ordered the last of the ribs so, he now has to order something else on the fly. We still didn't get any water but the waitress brings us our bill and asks if we would like to take some drinks to go. When she comes back with our to go drinks, she now informs is that we cannot use our cards to pay the bill because the machine was down. Now, that would've been useful information when we first arrived, as we had already used most of our cash earlier in the day. After reading a few other reviews, the poor service seems a little common over the last few weeks but, the food is still great. Improve the service and 5 stars would not be a problem. Bad service makes people not want to come back. #mylittletwocents"}
{"text":"I am going to go w/ 3.5 on this one but closer to 3 than 4.  I definitely dug the atmosphere.  Staff was nice enough and the cornbread pancake was a nice way to start the meal.  But it just came down to the chicken itself for me.  It just didn't blow me away at all.  I know it'll probably come off as insane but I think KFC has better and more reasonably priced chicken than here.  This also is nothing compared to Roscoe's or other soul food places I've been to.    

Don't get me wrong..it wasn't bad..just average for me."}
{"text":"I travel a lot. And everywhere I go, I check out who has the best soulfood places. Hands down this is my favorite. Everytime I am in Las Vegas Im at this spot. Only thing I dont like about this place is the service. Other than that, I luv this spot"}
{"text":"Service is beyond bad. We waited over an hour for food that was cold and old. Don't bother with this place."}
{"text":"Wait way too long for this food! Over 1 hour and we get offered nothing as far as beverage. Second time giving both locations a try and they take way too long. You can go to 5 star restaurants and get serviced with quicker times for more complicated meals. 

No apology for the delay, just drop the bag off and walked away. 

The food is good but not worth over an hour and 20 mins to get your food."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! We were greeted as soon as we walked in the door, the server was fast and super friendly, and the food was amazing! The gravy on the smothered chicken was bomb and the mac and cheese was ridiculously Delicious! Only $14 for fried chicken, 3 sides, and corn cakes! Next time: breakfast"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in Vegas, this place is a must! The traditional home style menu is a welcomed change from the other restaurants offered on the strip. Food is prepared just like Grandma used to make. The corn cakes are my favorite! Fried fish, oxtails, short ribs, you name it, they've got it!"}
{"text":"Ok...I'm always hesitant to go to a soul food restaurant. Although I hardly ever eat it now, I was raised on soul food in a family of the best soul food cooks ever. Today was my birthday and my partner surprised me with a trip to M &M. The facility seems very much updated from some of the pics that I've seen on Yelp. It has the feel of a diner. It was very clean and comfortable. I will say that I was a little paranoid with the security guard in front of me with a gun. Interesting, but I suppose I should be happy. 

The food...to my surprise...VERY GOOD! I had mac & cheese, collard greens, and potato salad. Oh...dare I forget...chitterlings. I was politely corrected...chitlins...I was always corrected as a child too... The corn bread that they bring before the meal was amazing. It was round, light, sweet, and YUM. Then came the meal. The collards were superbly cooked and seasoned. The potato salad was delectable. The mac & cheese was a tad dry,  but good. The \"chitterlings\" were scrumptious...people passed my table and were asking how they were. I think in general, people are scared to eat them. DON'T BE SCARED....just order and enjoy. My partner ordered rice and beans(just ok), yams (very sweet and good), and BBQ chicken. I was very disappointed in the chicken only because it seemed as if they took their baked chicken and put BBQ sauce on it. That's not BBQ chicken. The baked chicken was good and the BBQ sauce was good, but it wasn't BBQ chicken. Lol...

The service was really good. Our server was friendly, attentive, and helpful with food choices. Our food arrived quickly. The prices were comparable to other soul food restaurants. That's another topic that I won't even go into. Overall...a solid four and maybe 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Found this place while driving around.  OMG, best soul food I have eaten in Vegas.  Amazing service.   Most friendliest and attentive staff.  Loved it so much that it will be a mandatory stop everytime we come to Vegas!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here 3 times and have always left satisfied . Oxtails and Gravy will change your life . Muddy Waters drink was good , friendly staff . Whenever I'm in town they can expect me to stop by ."}
{"text":"Authentic soul food. Can't say enough positive things about how good the food is. Breakfast is where it's at!"}
{"text":"I was thoroughly impressed with the southern authenticity of the dishes. Absolutely first class food. As if a small-town Mississippi restaurant was teleported to Las Vegas. Many regulars there too -- that's always a good sign. Highly recommended. (My only negative is the air conditioning -- lack thereof)"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this restaurant due to the high praise it received on yelp. I was very disappointed with the food that I got. I was expecting to have an authentic soul food experience. The service was decent at best with the wait time to be seated and how long it took to get the food. All in all I will say that this place is not terrible and that your experience may be different from mine but from my first experience was not good"}
{"text":"This place is pretty pretty pretty good when it comes to soul food.  I loved this place at the same time it really fell short.  I must be hypercritical because this place has a hyped up reputation and I cannot simply just nod my head.

Went around lunch time and it was packed, so we sat at the counter.  Service was slow, I mean the type of slow where you consider getting up and leaving.  You get better service at Chinese restaurants in china town. (that is not good).

We ordered as soon as we were finally acknowledged.  It took a good 5 minutes just to get a glass of water.  15 minutes after sitting down we got some little corn cakes.  These were thin corn pancakes.  Did not like them. I could taste the baking powder in them.  Why can't I get a piece of good cornbread at a soul food place!!????  WHY????????  Not a pancake, muffin or fritter - but a piece of damn cornbread!

Then 49 minutes after sitting down and people who came in after us getting their food... we got our 2 orders of chicken and waffles plus greens and mac and cheese.  Waitress forgot our sides - had to ask.

The chicken was good.  It was crispy and juicy.  Big wings too. The waffles were different and damn good.  They may have been wheat with a cinnamon flavor.  Not sure.  They were fluffy and had a nice shell to the outside.  Just right.  I ate the 2 off my plate and another off my daughters!  The mac and cheese was ok.  The greens - I was a little disappointed.  Too much of the ribs were in the greens and they just seemed a little tired.

The service wasn't bad, the ladies there working were working hard, but the service was just blasé.  Places like this get so used to being busy - they forget what got them there.  Waiting close to an hour for your dinner is wrong and not even saying anything to placate the customer is even worse.  You get the if you don't like you can leave attitude here.

I sat at the counter and I could see in the back.  It was a mess, and that just makes me wonder.

I wanted to give this place 5 stars - I really did.  The food wasn't good enough to overcome the lackluster service and curt attitude.  The greens and corncakes were poorly done.  Strangely enough I will go back, but with lower expectations.

I have yet to find a soul food joint in Vegas that has friendly service, real good food, clean establishment and a decent piece of cornbread!"}
{"text":"The food was ok could of been better..mash potatoes are instant mashed potatoes...greens not cleaned right Mac and cheese needs more seasoning the waiters are great The catfish wasn't catfish..."}
{"text":"OMG. This place is packed all the time, and we usually have to wait... but the wait is worth it because the food you get is AMAZING!! Fried Catfish is my favorite. So good. Must go. Wish it was in a bigger location. Lots of food for you buck!"}
{"text":"Delicious Smothered Fried Chicken! Greens are good too. Love the fact that they serve Kool-Aide and so does my kids. The Short Ribs are also delicious and super tender. The Oxtails are a must have.

If you goal is to locate premier Soul Food Restaurant (ready to fall asleep at the table once full) then this is your spot. Oh did I mention nice portions, a real bang for your buck. We love this place!"}
{"text":"Totally awesome!!!!  The food was excellent and our server Christine was even better.  I'm full and still have enough left over for another meal. Wish I lived in Vegas, I'd eat here everyday."}
{"text":"I wish I could give zero stars our waitress was nice service was horrible food was not worth the long wait"}
{"text":"'TIS THE SEASON
Who:  Party of 8, including the BF, BFF, L.T.D., and the Qs.
When:  Thursday, 11/6/14, 7:30pm
What:  Oxtail, mac n cheese, potato salad, and sweet tea for me.  Others had fried chicken, meatloaf, catfish, red beans and rice, yams, mashed potatoes, cornbread dressing with gravy, and peach cobbler.

There's nothing better than a good meal with your favorite people.  It's been a few years since I've been back to M & M, but I'm glad we paid a visit last night because that's what we had.  It's that time of year when the belly wants comfort food like ramen or Southern food.  We had ramen last week, so oxtail sounded like a good idea.  We showed up at 7:30pm and immediately learned that the restaurant closes at 8:00pm, not 9:00pm as their Yelp listing says.  Hoping we wouldn't get turned away, the M&M staff was very accommodating and told us that we wouldn't get kicked out due to it being so close to quitting time, but that we should order ASAP, especially if we wanted any of the fried items.  Two tables were cleaned off quickly and put together for us and we were seated posthaste.  Our waitress, Shy, was fabulous; that lady got our orders as soon as we made our decisions.  Soon enough, we were drinking (sweet tea, Muddy Water, regular un-muddy water), eating the delicious complimentary cornbread pancakes, watching Thursday Night Football on the flat screens, and getting caught up while we waited for our food.  Somehow the last person to arrive got her food first: whut?  And, it was fried chicken so the staff wasn't wasting any time getting us fed.  Soon after, everyone else's plates arrived, we got down on the good stuff, and silence ensued.  I love oxtail and my order was just the way I like it:  tender, fall-off-the-bone goodness.  Unfortunately, my side choices were a tad disappointing this go-round.  The mac n cheese lacked flavor and I had to salt it, something I rarely do.  The scoop of potato salad was just okay, as well; I've definitely had better.  But, the b/f's yams and cornbread dressing were on point, so I'd get those next time.  Everyone else enjoyed their meals and we concurred that it was another fabulous fall meal.  Shy split the check four ways which was also greatly appreciated; the whole staff there was great, actually.  It's safe to say that we'll be back for more soul food at M&M this holiday season; check it out if you need some comfort, too.
**M&M Soul Food will have a second location opening up across the street from the Stratosphere in the next week and it will be open 24 hours--be on the lookout!"}
{"text":"The service was good. The cornbread patties (corn cakes) are reallllyyyy good. I got the smothered pork chops, greens, mac n cheese and rice (with gravy). My hubby got the shrimp and grits and the chicken and waffles plate. The pork chops were seasoned good. At first I thought it was the gravy that was good but the gravy for my rice was bland so I knew the pork chop was well seasoned. The mac n cheese was ok, the greens could have been seasoned. But the grits and shrimp was THE BOMB. No doubt about it they were delicious. My husband said the chicken and waffles were good. He really liked the waffles. The koolaid was great and unlimited refills. Wouldn't mind going back!"}
{"text":"I don't understand how this restaurant functions (M&M Cafe). We were seated at 1:49 pm and are still waiting on food @ 3:30 pm. I know readers will wonder why did we stay so long. When you arrive, they do have a disclaimer stating if you order fried food it can take up to 45 minutes. However far beyond accurate. This is my first time here and I can already state I will never enter this establishment again. The waiters don't tend to the patrons like they should and when asked on numerous occasions about our food, they never return with an explanation. Our food arrived at 3:47pm, and to add to the shenanigans the food was not good. We were really excited about this but will never be back!!!!!! The manager is terrible!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm still in awe of how great this place was! From the great service from our server Ne-Ne and out host to the yummy food! I will be back when I'm in Vegas. We were staying at the SLS Las Vegas and stumbled upon this gem which is just a hop and a skip. We had 3 entrees and 6 sides shared between 2 people which was MORE than enough food. Everything was savory and cooked to perfection. Shoutout to the collard greens which is a good I'm always picky about and the short ribs. Notable mentions for the fried chicken and snapper. Ne-Ne let us know about the original LA locations which is where I reside and I will now be visiting. Thank you guys. 

P.S. The koolaid is a must try! Hahaha"}
{"text":"For me its really hard to find soul food in San Diego, so when I found one in Vegas I was more than excited and set my expectation as high as Roscoe's. The food was great! The pricing was good! The service was horrible! It was around 2pm on a Thursday afternoon, not sure if that's the normal time for rush hour. It took them 5 mins to get our waters and 25 mins to order our food, which took another 30 mins to finally get. Besides waiting, it was really good. I would have to go back there, but I now have the expectation to wait forever."}
{"text":"Our waitress(the fat azz one)was terrible. My buddy asked her for tartar sauce and some cornbread and she completely ignored him. The other young lady with the somewhat good hair brought the items, but it seemed to be a bother. Shame on us for asking them to do their job. I hope they realize that they need customers, customers don't need them. I would never go back, even if this was the last Soul food place in Las Vegas. Unfortunately, my buddy screwed up and we were supposed to be finding Lola's Chicken and Waffles. I wish that a zero star rating was possible. DONT GO TO THIS PLACE. I'M SURE THERE HAVE TO BE BETTER IN VEGAS."}
{"text":"Yummy Soulfood! Very delicious. The restaurant is a little dark and basic, but food rating is 5 stars. 4 meals + a desert comes out to be about $70ish."}
{"text":"Need better service,  our waitress  was a little unprofessional, the menu had chicken fried steak, but I got chicken fried chicken, to a native Texan, that's a no no, it took another waitress to bring me lemons for my water that I asked for when ordering..they corrected the situation by giving me my original order of liver and onions...the chicken fried steak was the waitress suggestion."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst soul food spot ever. This location is surely a detriment to the M&M's brand as a whole. I took my family of 5 here for breakfast today. Tonisha my server, greeted me and sat us. 

Then after I asked Tonisha if breakfast was still being served. She proceeded to tell me breakfast was over at 10:45am when I know that breakfast should be over at 11:00am. After recanting her statement about breakfast being over she left my table to take someone else's order that arrived after my family. That rude gesture was only second to her purposely waiting until after 11:00am so much so that I had to get up and locate her manager to take our order and inform us that breakfast was over yet again. 

Needless to say I voiced my disgust with the matter and promptly took my family and left. Never to return to this location again. 

It is a sad shame that when we as a people try to support black business and give back to the community and we are treated with such contempt and disregarded with complete disrespect."}
{"text":"Looking for a soul food place better than mama can make? This is it. I had the fried chicken with a side of Mac and cheese and greens. Wow! That was the bomb! Really good."}
{"text":"Food was ok, short ribs had too much fat!! Server was nice, but it took to long to tell us to come to the counter to pay!! Way better than the 1 on the strip"}
{"text":"I wish I didn't have to give them a star... they are not organized at all... service is the worst I have ever seen!! Waiting for a whole hour then they tell me they out of short ribs, on top of all that... they helped customers that came in after us and they got there food before us... actually they were served before 3 customers that was there before them!! I would advise a whole new management team this place is horrible!!"}
{"text":"We went in wanting breakfast only to find out they stop serving at 12:00.So we decided lunch would be OK. I ordered the seafood gumbo.The bf ordered the short rib with beans and rice and mac and cheese that were average. the gumbo was slimy and greasy and more slime the okra had made the gumbo the consistency of snot. The attentive waitress noticed that i did not care for it and she took it off the bill. The service here cant be beat and there breakfast is delish. I heard whispers behind me must have been from regular customers \"she didn't like the gumbo?\"  no sadly i did not . 24.00 for two lunch. will be back but only for breakfast."}
{"text":"Here's the complaint. I order the 3 piece fried chicken dinner and they send me home with 4 chicken wings. I love there chicken and I will say it's delicious , but I constantly receive what they have and not what I order . They have no system for take out. You can be first there but they will take the order of another because they don't know who was there first. 45 minutes to receive your food and not what you ordered is why I am giving it 2 stars. The Mac and cheese is not worth ordering since there is little cheese in it. There greens and yams are great. Check your order before you leave the place because I will say from experience that it's 50/50 if you get the food you ordered ."}
{"text":"Came in and was told they ran out of food and were not taking in more orders. Walked right out."}
{"text":"So I came from Los Angeles to Vegas for the wk & decided to go to M&M like always when I
 Out here & I ordered a chicken meal & the menu said $11.99 but I was charged 13.99 & my dude was over charged for his meal as well. so when I said false advertisement we need the price that's on the menu & asked to speak to a manger she said I had to text this 702-957-1679 & they replied speak to a manager smmfh they lucky my dude wasn't tripping & paid for it cause I would have not paid for nothing more than what the prices was on the menu. The lady gone tell me they went up on prices & she had no idea. Oh yeah & to top that off they bathroom smell like sewerage old water I had to hold my pee cause I couldn't bare the smell. I promise I'm never going to M&M in Vegas again I'll support the ones in LA. I'm pissed they could have gave us the the menu prices."}
{"text":"This place does not have no host what so ever , next thing you know they just telling us to put our names on a paper. Employees act like your not here . They have 5 tables with people and yet we are still waiting to be seated more than 45 mins. This is ridiculous if your really hungry don't even try coming here."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would! My experience was horrible!!! Stop before you even think of visiting this so called restaurant!  We waited a total of two and a half hours just to get our food!  There was a fifty minute wait to be seated, after we were seated we waited twenty minutes for a waitress to finally take our order, then waited another hour and ten minutes for the food to come out.  The food was served luke warm and the flavor did not live up to \"M & M's\" famous reputation.  This location is under staffed and lacks the professionalism needed for any successful business.  I WILL NEVER RETURN!"}
{"text":"Great food, very nice people. Chicken n waffles are bomb! Been eating here for over 15+ years. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Walked in a little before 9, took about 10 minutes before we were acknowledged & at that point asked to have a seat to be seated!! Huh!?!  Once seated another 10 minutes went by and still no server to even take a drink order! How bout hell to the naw!!!! We out YOUR SERVICE SUCK BULLYSTICKS!!!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to visit this place because it was close to my family's hotel room. Called in our order and when we got to the location we still had to wait (no big deal). The biggest issue was the lack of customer service and Princilla's attitude. I asked if she could microwave one of the dinners and her response was \"we don't have a microwave\" \"we'll re-do it but it will take a long time\" She also rudely told us they don't have spoons. 
I enjoyed the food but due to the experience I will not be back and will go to Soul Food Cafe."}
{"text":"Havnt eaten at M&Ms in two years decided to try it today meatloaf macncheese and greens w yams food was cool better than my last experience will try it again in another two yrs."}
{"text":"Simple, well-prepared comfort food -- loved the complimentary corn cakes!! Oh!! -- and the muddy water -- yum!!

I had the fried chicken half order with collard greens and Mac& cheese. It was just like home growing up... Delicious.

My little guy had a cheeseburger and it was awesome. It had some kind of puree that made the burger.

The wife had the pork chop dinner with mashed potatoes and string beans. The potatoes were real and lumpy and the string beans were canned -- and we dug it!!

Service was good and staff was sooo friendly :-)

Price was a little high for the simplicity of the food but overall we didn't break the bank, and the friendly service alone was worth it.

We'll be going back again :-)"}
{"text":"Angie was nice as always ! She has amazing customer service skills ! Made sure I had everything I needed also so kind with her words! She's the reason I come back"}
{"text":"The food is definitely 5 star!

But they aren't very attentive especially when they are busy .... I came alone and it took 45min just for someone to acknowledge me and take my order ... And I had to get up and get my own menu!!!

But long story short! 
I will come back again I usually always do EVERYTIME I visit . But they just need to getbrhwrw shit together for future purposes ! we the people will gladly appreciate"}
{"text":"Stopped in with a craving for home cooked meal. Went with family we were seated next to a rowdy ghetto table. Waitress took our drink orders and brought us some flimsy corn cakes, before our meal. Confused as to why these aren't served with meal? Ordered smothered fried chicken, greens, mac n cheese and yams. Took about 30 mins for meal which was pipping hot. Mac n cheese was so so, yams and greens out of a can, how do they offer homestyle cooking? But use canned food?. Chicken was ok, big pieces a little on the salty side. Sorry to say that I wont return, and still left with a craving for some good ole \"home cookin\""}
{"text":"My initial review was going to be FOREVER, BUT I MUST KEEP IT SHORT! So my husband and I visiting from California, was told by our hotel staff that this place is a HIT. We arrive around 1220p (2/19/18) greeted and seated immediately. Received our drinks then orered our food. 20 mins pass still no silverware, and noticed this older couple mentioned to waiters it's been 40mins and still no food. RED FLAG WE IGNORED. Here we are at 1:11p STILL NO FOOD almost an hr. 10mins after that food arrives cold. Hubby had salmon croquets made with very little salmon and too much egg. He asked for \"over easy/med.\" Eggs which is not RUNNNYYY. I had another pork chops breakfast. 

This wait was crazy... to find out the ORIGINAL COOL DIDN'T COME TO WORK, AND THEY HAD THE DISHWASHER GUY COOKING.... so I was told by waitress..
 Saying sorry for the wait after we were ready to pay! Should be been mentioned before seating us."}

{"text":"Decided to stop by the restaurant to have breakfast and as my fiance and I were seated in the beginning the service was great until our actual server came to the table took out order despite the fact that I did not get my drink of Kool-Aid until my food was gone as if I was a child waiting for my parent to bring my drink but as my fiance try to get  Vee attention by flaging  her down because we had still not yet received our drink we had to flag another server down just to make sure we got the service that we were paying for and on top of that my fiance notice that she (vee) was in the back having a conversation with someone who had not even ordered and not tending to her guests it took another waiter to neglect her customer to wait on my table and made sure all my needs was met if vee would have spent more time attending to her guest instead of attending to someone who had either already eaten their food I believe my service would have went better than what it did"}
{"text":"Pros:
The food was great.
Tried the dressing, mac and cheese, ribs, snapper.
Cons:
The server forgot about a few times and I had to use a friends fork to eat.
The portions are kind of small for the prices."}
{"text":"Like many others have posted, this place has the WORST customer service. Walked in to a pretty much vacant seating area. Were told to seat ourselves. The 5 of us sat down, waited for about 10 minutes, still no waiter/waitress. Two other folks came in, got seated, and the waitress went right to them to take their order and we're still waiting for anyone to come over to our table. Yeah, we got right up and rolled out."}
{"text":"I haven't been having the best of luck this week at restaurants. I ordered fried chicken with all dark meat and to my surprise after I got all the way home I had all white meat. I immediately called the restaurant and told them I got the wrong food and the lady  told me to come back and she will rectify my situation. I came back and my food was hot and ready for me with a smile and a sincere apology. Also the manager immediately greeted me with an apology and a smile when he saw me come in. In my opinion that was the best customer service I have gotten in a long time and I really appreciate the prompt service that I received without any attitude. Way to go. Good job guys"}
{"text":"5 stars for service!!

The girl that took our order for lunch (8/20/11) was great!!  She made us feel at home. She was very attentive, efficient and spoke to us with a smile :)  She was possibly one of the \"best servers\" I've ever had.

Las Vegas + Southern Comfort Food = M & M Soul Food Cafe :)"}
{"text":"Started with some muddy water, ordered catfish,mac n cheese, greens, and yams. It was amazing. It hit the spot, frfr"}
{"text":"Long wait. Took about 20 mins to be seated in a half empty restaurant and in additional 40 mins to get our food. The waitress couldn't even wait till we all got in our chairs or opened our menus to ask what drinks we wanted. Took her forever to come back and take our orders.. Terrible food. My food came out cold and my sister's wasn't thoroughly cooked, my little niece threw up the yams at the table. Not to mention our food was also chilling in a large puddle of grease on the plate...Oh yea, no fries after 4pm.. Tf?She was rude and kept trying to mask it by calling everyone at the table \"babe\".. Just bad overall."}
{"text":"service from the waitress was horrible. My first time at the las vegas location will be my last. when people are visiting  a restaurant paying their money they should be nice to you and not rude and act as if their job is inconvenience to help you when they're asking for coffee or cream or napkins
 On top of that they got check wrong .Tashara, sorry to say you need a better attitude and if your attitude was this bad in the morning i would hate to see what you were like in the afternoon."}
{"text":"Better than anything else around. Great portions for the price. Service was very friendly. Very clean."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying out M&M's even tho I've been to Vegas a million times. The smothered pork chops were great and the mac n cheese was decent. The cabbage was a little watered down and looked a little bit like it had been cooked to death. The dressing was tasty and whatever the little pancake cornbread thingies were - they were delicious!  Definitely friendly service. They sing happy birthday to people too. Super cute."}
{"text":"I came to visit this place two days in a row both days it was packed so that was a good sign. The service is the only thing I didn't enjoy here it was slow my orders came back wrong both days. Once the correct plate arrived to our table it was great the food is amazing but it's clear its a black own business."}
{"text":"If your looking for some good homemade southern cooking this is IT!!! We have ate here MANY times over the years!
Its amazing! Always had great service, great food! 
It is a little ways from the strip but so worth going to if your in town. Its one of those hole in the wall places you would never expect to get such great food!
From the moment you sit and get your drinks and the corn cake that come out hot and once you try it you will want more! They are the best I have ever had.
The fried chicken is so good! Along with their cooked cabbage, mac and cheese. The sides are really good. Everytime I want some good fried Chicken this is where we go!
No one in town makes it as good as this place. Great Comfort food at its best! 
Everyone is always so friendly and very welcoming. 
Everyone we bring loves this place too!

Keep up the great job M& M :)"}
{"text":"M&M, why do you have to be all the way in Vegas? Why can't be you be in San Francisco so I can eat at your place all the time? I know why because you don't want me to weigh 500 pounds. Thank you M&M for your delicious fried chicken. Can't wait to visit you again."}
{"text":"Great food great service the cat fish was on point server kept topping off my ice tea without me asking for sure I'll be back"}
{"text":"Do you like fried chicken? A southern delight. The fried chicken does not get dropped till you order it..... Best black eye peas I ever had
 My friend doubled down on the collard greens!!! Keisha is a great server. The cool aid and tea got a Lil sweetness. Outstanding .... By the way they were out of Mac and cheese and cornbread.... Didn't matter. I am assuming they are fabulous! Get in and getyoselfsome!"}
{"text":"I love how they start your meal off with complimentary cornbread pancakes, that was yummy for sure.

We were in the mood for breakfast however during the week they stop serving breakfast at 11am, so we ordered off the lunch/dinner menu instead.

I decided on short ribs with mac and cheese, cornbread stuffing for my sides. My babez ordered meatloaf, mac and cheese, fried okra.  We both ordered half orders which come with two sides. 

I ordered the kool-aid which they give free refills on and I love how they serve the drinks out of mason jars that is an Awesome cute touch!

The kool-aid was delicious, just like the 80's kool-aid I grew up on! I sure wish I could make it this good at home!

The food was good but I had such high expectations that I found myself disappointed with the overall food. :(

The mac and cheese, we both prefer my homemade classic recipe I make at home as theirs was good but nothing I would have to come here to eat. The fried okra has a thick cornmeal batter on it that kind of overpowers the taste of the okra. The cornbread stuffing is made with real cornmeal cornbread however was dry, without the gravy on top I would not have finished it. I make better meals than this at home, so I don't know if I can justify coming back for a meal. However may be back for Kool-aid and to try their banana pudding dessert! The short ribs were tender and delicious for sure, as I really enjoyed the meat falling off of the bone!

The star at this place is the kool-aid and the Fantastic service! The Servers at this joint really know how to make you feel welcome!

We might be back to give it another shot and order different things on the menu as I am just not satisfied wih this rating. I want it to be better than just OK so I will really make an attempt to come back and try again. I really wanted to love it, however I was just disappointed because it was nothing special and did not live up to the hype!"}
{"text":"Waitresses make you feel right at home. \"Baby, don't be shy about the cornbread.\" Oh honey, we weren't. I honestly can't recall how many stacks my party went through. Say goodbye to that Vegas diet..

Most of us ordered the chicken. Fried. Baked. Smothered. However you like it. It was tender and juicy - never dry. The sauce can be a bit much so opt out if you don't like your fried chicken soggy. 

As for the sides, I tried the yams, fried okras, and mashed potatoes. All were pretty standard, but I think the mash deserves a bit more butter. 

Overall, I would say food was not bad but +1 for the amazing, attentive service even on a busy night. 

Btw, they serve old school Kool-Aid [and it's bottomless!!]. \"Oh yeahhh!\""}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed in this restaurant.  We waited an hour for our food. Kool aid was really sweet. I asked for gravy on the side of my corn bread stuffing which they forgot to bring until I asked for and, and it was very dry. My niece friend chicken was extremely hard to where she couldn't eat it. Very disappointed don't know if I would come back."}
{"text":"Chicken is great. Red beans and rice are the best I have ever had !!.  The corn bread hot water cakes were as good or better than the red beans and rice. Mac and cheese leaves a lot to be desired. Their world famous gravy is so goood. Green beans have a great flavor even if they are out of a can. Yams are very tasty also. Over all a good meal. A little pricy  for what you get but great comfort food."}
{"text":"Seriously the worst service I have gotten EVER in Las Vegas. I can't even comment on the food because the staff was so incredibly rude we walked out. Unless you are used to being yelled at by your waitress, I highly recommend the IHOP across the street!!!"}
{"text":"The food is always great, good ol' school playing in the background, friendly staff....and free WiFi so I can work if I choose too!"}
{"text":"I'm from Georgia and I'm so picky about my soul food. This right here is the truth. I had the fried chicken (2 wings), mac and cheese, and collard greens. Everything was delicious. The fried chicken reminded me of how my great grandmother used to fry chicken. Collards were my least favorite. Overall, I will return. Service was great too."}
{"text":"I ate at the M&M Soul Food Cafe TWICE today.  I'm almost embarrassed to say that I tried all of the following.  For breakfast, I tried fried chicken wings, waffles, scrambled eggs, and home fried potatoes.  For dinner, I had the beef ribs, ox tails, greens, black eyed peas, corn bread pancakes, and macaroni and cheese.  I also had one of my wife's pieces of smothered fried chicken.  I believe that all of this gives me enough information to provide a comprehensive opinion on the restaurant.

This was simply the best restaurant that I've eaten at.  I should not have eaten as much as I did but I just couldn't help myself!  I just kept eating and eating.  This is the kind of food my mother used to make but doesn't anymore because it would take days!  Well, she never did fry chicken for breakfast to go with waffles.  The chicken was served on bones like chicken is supposed to be and the you've just not lived until you've slurped on some ox tails in public.  The breakfast potatoes were to die for as they were nicely browned and well seasoned.

Although I didn't try it, my wife enjoyed her turkey sausage and didn't mind going back for a second time in the same day.  The beef ribs are cross cut like riblets and offered with BBQ sauce or gravy.

I want to go back again because these were stupid huge plates of food and I simply didn't have room for any dessert (banana pudding, peach cobbler, chocolate cake, yellow cake, sweet potato pie).

The owners enjoyed watching someone who really enjoyed their cooking throwing it down.  If you're visiting Las Vegas, this is worth the short drive away from the Strip."}
{"text":"I've been to M&Ms in Los Angeles and was thrilled to stumble across this hidden jewel in Vegas. I ordered the pork chops smothered in gravy with eggs and homestyle potatoes. Let me tell you... It was amazing! So tender and favorable, price was reasonable and the customer service was great! I look forward to visiting again my next trip to Vegas!"}
{"text":"This was our 3rd visit, most likely it'll be our last visit.

The service level has taken a serious dive. The waitresses were too busy chatting and cackling with each other,  to even greet us at the door. Once we were seated, it took approx. 5 minutes just to place our drink order.

Being checked on, during the meal...no such luck!

This place has gone downhill, it's certainly not the place it was during our last visits. We come up from California, so, this is not even worth adding to our to-do list."}
{"text":"WOW.....This place can teach a lot to the \"hole\" in the Crenshaw district of LA with the same name.  Not only is this place much cleaner, the wait staff are nice and check on you to make sure the experience is good.
The cornbread pancakes are so good. What a nice way to launch into you're meal.  Some of you may be disgusted and I don't care but I'm a huge fan of Chitterlings and I got a good serving at M&M's. Taste almost as good as mine and my Mom's.  Add Mac n' Cheese, Collard's and rice and gravy and I was a happy camper.  Thank God I have friends I can visit in Vegas because next time I' back, I'll be stopping by M&M's.  I have a good feeling everything on the menu is really good."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at m&ms today. My waitress pearl was very sweet, attentive and friendly. Our food came in a timely manor, was hot.. fresh and very delicious. I am in Vegas celebrating my birthday and some of the staff came together to sing happy birthday to me. Thank you M & Ms we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went on a recommendation of my daughter, who lives in Vegas and is a frequent customer.  We were greeted by the very friendly staff when we walked in.  We then got a plate with 2 cornbread pancakes - awesome!  I ordered the catfish, macaroni & cheese, collard greens - really good, not too much breading on the catfish.   Husband got the meatloaf, green beans, and also the mac & cheese - really tasty.  Peach cobbler was ok.  Service is good and really friendly.  Will definitely go there next time I visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"We had a great time here today for lunch.. The waitresses were so nice and friendly.. The fried chicken was insane and i got mac n cheese, collar greens, and potato salad.. 

But i had to get desert fresh out of the oven sweet potato pie!!!! Dam im still kinda in food coma hours later...."}
{"text":"This was the best meal I have ever had in las Vegas and I have had some pretty epic meals here. Right across the street from the Stratosphere, parking is super easy. I definitely reccomend this place!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience at M & M Soul Food Cafe. The Oxtails were phenomenal and the hot cakes were delicious!  The Chef came to our table and made sure everything was ok. The staff were friendly. Great food."}
{"text":"so they have recently renovated this place finally! At least it is not as shabby as it was before, but still is not too chic... But i can't complain, the quality of the food is more important than the decor! As always love love love the chicken and waffles as well as the smothered pork chops! Love their corn bread too!!"}
{"text":"If you are from the east coast or south do not eat here. This is not soul food! The chicken was good but that was it. Lacked seasoning and I can tell the food was not prepared traditional \"soul food\" style. I'm from Virginia so I know what real soul food looks and taste like."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT.  Very small portions with high prices!!! Charged $0.50 extra for taking out... what???  Charged extra $1.50 for ordering white meat for the chicken... what???  Rude staff!!"}
{"text":"Good Eats!! Tranquil atmosphere and CLEAN!!! 

We were greeted with a big smile :-) Mouthwatering cornbread...homemade biscuits and scrambled eggs is just like momma 
N GiGi!! Our server (Pearl) went out of her way to ensure our experience was a pleasant memorable one. Nice decorated darkened yet transparent windows to keep it cool inside. I'm coming back for the peach cobbler b4 we dip!"}
{"text":"Excellent excellent tasty food fast service love it reminds me of a ny soul food place Amy Ruth's"}
{"text":"I had the fried catfish with mash potatoes EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS, then I asked for a sample of the Gumbo , being from down South ( N.O ) I figured it wouldn't have been good at all BUT to MY SURPRISE IT WAS ALSO DELICIOUS!! The only thing I regret is that the hotel I was in i did not have a microwave  I definitely would've ordered more"}
{"text":"4.5 \"finger lickin good\" stars!

I have been preparing vegan meals these past few days and my carnivorous husband has been such a trooper trying my cooking.  Well, apparently tonight he had enough of the kale and soy protein posing as beef, and was in the mood for some good ol' soul food. 

With a raving recommendation from one of his patients- we gave M&M Soul Food Cafe a try.  The complimentary cornbread pancakes already made such a great first impression.  Being a loyal customer of the original Roscoe's House of chicken and waffles in LA, I had to try M&M's version.  I feel like such a traitor because Roscoe's has NOTHING on them.  The seasoning on the fried chicken wings was so delicious, I was actually licking my fingers after every bite.  It was perfectly seasoned and not overly salty at all.  The waffles were also fabulous. A little sweeter than I am used to, but that was OK because it just meant I didn't need the syrup. The sweet and salty combo was perfection.  I ordered a side of fried okra which were OK and the collard greens that I devoured. 

My husband ordered the smothered chicken (dark meat) and that too was delicious. He ordered sides of yams and mac n' cheese.  The sides were good too, but the chicken was definitely the star.  There is no \"kids menu\" but our toddler daughter ate from our plates and was licking her fingers too!

To top it off, we finished the meal with some peach cobbler and it was the perfect sweet finish to a fabulous meal.  We originally wanted to try the BBQ short ribs but they had just run out when we came in, so that just gives us an excuse to come back even sooner (after a few nights of vegan meals, of course). 

Tim, the owner, made us feel at home from the second we sat down to the second we walked out the door.  And we actually did feel like we were at home, because we were able to watch the NBA playoffs as well."}
{"text":"Everything was really good for the most part was great service was even better & I plan to go again soon
I got the fried chicken full plate white meat, it came with 3 sides

Fried Chicken - Pretty good,  crunchy, well flavored would definitely get again
Macaroni and cheese - Good flavor just dry a tad disappointed because I live for Macaroni & Cheese
Cabbage - A tad sweet which threw me off at first but it was pretty good I liked it
Green Beans - Easily perfect
Kool-Aid - Also perfection"}
{"text":"It was ok. I'm from New Orleans so I have high expectations when it comes to southern food. I should have known nothing can really compare to the N.O. even if they add a Mississippi title in Las Vegas. 

Although I felt the somewhat southern hospitality, service was awful. There was hardly anyone there and it took us an hour and half to eat. 

The sauce used for the wings were amazing. I can't lie about that! But the mac-n-cheese was so so and the collars greens was pretty disgusting.

I wouldn't come here again."}
{"text":"Food was good, nothing to rave about. No hostess, so we stood there for awhile before being seated. 2 parties came in after us, were seated after us, ordered before us (no one came to take our order). Waited around for about 10 minutes after we were done eating before the check was brought to us and when we walked up to the register to pay, as we were quite frankly ready to go, we were told to sit down and wait. Folks always talking about support black businesses but why when the customer service is less than sub par."}
