{"text":"My wife had found this restaurant on a popular takeout website, Just-Eat.ca. The moment the food was revealed from its takeout packages, the greasy, overcooked staleness of the food could be inherently seen.   The food looked and tasted as if it had been sitting on low heat for several days in a nonchalance of the purest, most distilled heart-disease-ridden apathy; The food dripped with a putrid grease of an origin I do not wish to fathom nor investigate.  Little care was put into all of the dishes and I was not able to finish the food and neither was my wife.  May this restaurant fail if this is what it accepts as edible food.   You are better off driving to your local Super C and purchasing TV dinners, as you will find such food far more edible; Spare yourself the agony of eating Maison Luo's horrific cuisine."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible food. I waited over an hour and a half for overcooked and tasteless food. My wonton soup with noodles only had 3 wontons. They even called me to charge me 3$ more than the Just Eat delivery fee eventhough they confirmed I was within a 10km radius. Trust me, don't waste your time on this place."}
{"text":"Been ordering from here for 3 years now. Always been fast and amazing. Sushi is surprisingly great for one of those fast Thai places. Peanut butter dumplings a must spring rolls and the California rolls are sick."}
{"text":"\"This is nasty!\" is the phrase I repeated at least 3 times while attempting to eat the plate I ordered from Maison Luo one cold January evening. I could not finish my plate.  I should have known what to expect, yet I decided to give the Verdun-based Chinese restaurant a try. I ordered online and the food arrived within half an hour. The food was very greasy and overcooked. The eggplant dish I ordered for my husband and I had been left to stew so long it was basically tasteless by the time it got to my mouth.  Maison Luo is ideal for individuals who thrive on cheap fast food and who do not have much regard for culinary quality. If you can bring yourself to eat your dish, it will fill up your stomach but won't do much more than that, unfortunately.  There are plenty of affordable Chinese restaurants in Montreal serving better food than Maison Luo. If you are a foodie, avoid. Save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Got major stomach bug after eating with them a day later. Not taking my chances again."}
