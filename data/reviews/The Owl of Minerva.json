{"text":"Unfortunately my two friends were sick after eating their lunch.  I was OK but they said it was too spicy."}
{"text":"You cannot go wrong with the Pork Bone Soup at this place! It's a small restaurant with a relatively small menu, however you can tell the staff put in effort to make the customers happy. The Pork Bone Soup is my go-to 99% of the time, it has generous portions of meat (usually 3 hocks) and comes with some potatoes, cabbage, and rice served on the side. Their other dishes such as the Bibimbap, tofu soup, and kalbi are also delicious! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"All the dishes in this restaurant are very tasty. Me and my boyfriend have been coming here for forever.  We first discovered owl of Minerva from the food court at T&T @ Steeles and Middlefield and tried pork bone soup and kalbi.  Soo tasty!! Food is home style cooking and vey flavorful.  Servers at this restaurant are very nice.  Me and my boyfriend love food and we like to try different dishes.  We've tried almost all the food in their menu and we can honestly say they are delicious.   Another good point, servers don't keep reminding you if you've ordered too many food (esp lots of dishes for only 2 people that are ordering :). I'm just saying since we've been to some restaurants that become rude due to the fact that they question how much we order.  We don't waste food if we dont finish we take it home and besides trying different dishes makes us know which we can order again next time we come back to a restaurant.  We have brought family members and friends at this location  and they all enjoyed coming here."}
{"text":"We ordered Haemul pajoun(the seafood pancake)approx$15, Ginseng Chicken soup(approx$17), and the squird and mushroom soup(approx$19). Worst Korean food ever. We can taste the flour in the pancake mix, also, only green onion(LOTS OF Green Onion), red onion piece, and a few squird slice are found in the pancake - as a total pretty big size but tasting very bad. Remember tried the pancake at the yonge location about 3 months ago - comparing to this the last one is heaven food. Ordering the Chicken soup is another mistake. Chicken is not tender at all, very very dry in texture. Soup is tasteless, can't even call it a chicken broth. Understand that you cannot expect as much in the real food as it is in the picture of the menu. However, I am really disappointed when expected that much as it is called a best seller and chef recommendation in the menu - such a disappointment. Not much to say about the squird and mushroom soup. Overall, we paid about $50 for 3 dishes with only 3 appetizer dish(Which is really really really disappointing as we always expect MORE in a Korean restaurant), priced too high, food is not good at all, definitely not going back again. Owl of M is one of the korean restaurant that is fair priced, hearty soup and nice food. But for sure not at the richmond location. Tho there is always a long line at the yonge location - the waiting is worth it! Just don't go to the Richmond location."}
{"text":"Not sure why there are so many bad reviews, I loved this place! We were originally going to go to the tofu house next door but it's currently going under renos, so we decided to go here by chance. I actually saw the mediocre reviews and was afraid to go at first, but I'm so glad we went!  We got the Spicy dukkkbokki jeungol  and it was amazing. The food came really fast and the people there are friendly and helpful. We also got the seafood tofu soup which was deeeeelicious. Came piping hot with lots of seafood meats and a bowl of rice. It was a really great experience, and our total was only a bit under $40 and there was 4 of us!  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the interior isn't the greatest, it would be really great if they did some work to make the ambience a bit better but honestly it was still totally worth it and we would go again."}
{"text":"Going for lunch with my coworkers and very disappointed with their services. Food are average and also lack of side dish options. When we asked for refills the side dishes, they seems to get mad at us."}
{"text":"Most if the dishes are good value in light if the price. The LA Kalbi was the weakest dish we tried as many places serve better beef kalbi but at higher prices.   If you are into spicy food, the pork bone soup is what really stands out here.  However, it is best only when they load it up extra spicy and the pepper really brings out the real taste of the  meat.  Served mild, it's more pedestrian.   If you're really into beef kalbi, this place is not for you.  But if you want spicy pork bone soup.  This is the best in all Toronto."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and ordered the Pork Bone Soup for $7.99. It also came with a side of 3 different types of banchan (pickled cucumber, spicy turnip, and kimchi). The pork bone soup was well flavored. Although it wasn't as rich as other I had before, but in any case it was good. Mine came with 3 big chunks of pork bones and small potato. The meat and bone ratio was fairly good. It also came with a bowl of rice on the side.    I have to say that the service was great. The waitress came by tocheck if I needed more banchans. One thing I liked is that I did not need to ask for more. Overall, the food and service was great. However, the pork bone soup was price a bit more than other competitive locations."}
{"text":"My go to Korean dish is bibimbap (stone bowl rice) and the one dish I use to compare between Korean restaurants.  Unfortunately, not my favourite dish from this restaurant.   I couldn't get myself to finish it because the rice was too soggy!   Maybe an unlucky day for them.  The ambience was also too dingy for me.  Service was good, but unfortunately, not enough for me to return."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good and the servers were very attentive and friendly. I had the bibimbap ($11.99) and my friend had the chicken bulgogi ($12.99). Decent sized portions for the price. The bibimbap was great but could have used a little bit more meat. Otherwise, no complaints! Menu has all the essential Korean dishes and is in no way overwhelming.   I give it a three star as opposed for to a five just for aesthetic. I know it's not supposed to be a fancy restaurant, but it seems like it could be a little bit cleaner in the eating area. Would come back and try other dishes!"}
{"text":"Stir-Fried Korean Beef, a traditional dish with onion, green & red pepper, mushroom and sesame. The meat is so flavorful... can't stop EATING!!!!"}
{"text":"We like that this Korean restaurant is open later than most. Our family loves Korean dishes, and this one is particularly good at hot pot soups. If you want something not too spicy, try the Bulogi hot pot soup. The bibimbap has generous meat and veggies. The seafood Sundubu has a variety of seafood including shrimp, mussels and squid. They even have a fried rice dish for members of your dining party that want something more mainstream"}
{"text":"You get very little for what you pay for.  I ordered a bibimbap and was surprised how little rice I get with it and there was barely any beef in it.  They only give you 3 side dishes regardless you come yourself or in a group. They won't come and ask if you need more, heck they didn't even come and refill our tea they just stood there.  The problem is lack of competition in the area so they get away with whatever they want.  There are only a couple of Korean restaurants there.  If you want the real deal go to Korean town area and look up on Yelp you will find more stars."}
{"text":"Just a place to grab a quick bite. You certainly won't be staying for the decor or ambiance. Food is ok, not bad and not something to write home about. Be sure to read my tip on this place."}
{"text":"Sizzling plates are so awesome. I am so glad to have found this place. I had no idea Korean food was this good. Been here three times in the last couple months, never disappoints. I will recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"I have tried many places for Pork Bone Soup and I always go back to Owl for pork bone soup because it the most tastiest one. I also love their Chicken Bolgogi but i think there is too much vegetables compared to chicken."}
{"text":"A number of us in my family, 10 of us, went for dinner one night. As someone mentioned while the decor is nothing to write home about the place is clean. However, If you love Korean food then it's a good place to go. We found the staff very friendly, with the owner /chef coming out to ask us how we liked the food. Only some of the food is spicy so if you don't like spice just ask which are not spicy and the staff will let you know. We all enjoyed the food (ages from 14 to 70+) and voted to eat there again next time we're together."}
{"text":"Ok restaurant in Oakville, though a welcome change from all the boring places in the area. Gotten a few items for take-out. Would recommend the bulgogi beef and seafood pancake (though could use some more seafood). Didn't like the bibimbap or the stir fried squid. Service is typically good."}
{"text":"I had an early dinner here.  The Gam Ja Tang (Korean Pork Bone Soup) was perfect for the winter weather.  It was tasty and satisfying and not much more.  I would come back but I won't be craving anytime soon."}
{"text":"Went: Sat May 16, 2015, 7:00 p.m. (74/100)  Ordered: pork bone soup and another dish I can't recall Cost: I can't recall but it was reasonably priced I've been to Owl many times and I think my gf has been too. It is solid, tasty Korean food, not the best, but you know what you will be getting. What does stick in my mind was one of the people at a nearby table competed at a high level in likely some Olympic sport and was talking about her many travels and competitions. Free accidental interesting entertainment. Another 3.5 stars, rounded up to 4.0."}
{"text":"I am updating, and giving owl 4 stars. Because we come so often, they now remember me and my \"crazy request\" for a raw egg. Today, our server asked me right away \"Tofu soup, Seafood with egg?\" I coud not be more pleased.   Plus their Kimchi is good, and I enjoy cutting it with the scissors. The mother makes it every morning. Plus it is family run and they are really, very nice.   They really need purple rice.   4 Stars."}
{"text":"As I was in the mood to get my Korean food fix for the week in I decided to try this place out and my usual plan is to have the Pork Bone Soup (spicy of course) and use it as a gauge for the place as a whole.  The PBS was pretty decent and the spiciness was just right for my taste: not tongue burning but definitely has a kick. It needs to be less stingy potatoes cos i only got one: maybe 3 would suffice if it could all fit into the bowls they use.   The banchan (aka side dishes) were very tasty but there wasn't much variety amongst the dishes as there was 2 Kim Chi dishes and 1 neutral dish. I could have done with some bean sprouts or marinated potatoes (to make up for the lack of potatoes in the PBS). That's all it is: lacking in variety.  The lady that was serving me was very polite and well mannered: something basic that's missing in many places."}
{"text":"This place always makes consistently good food. All the dishes are pretty simple (same sauces, different combination of ingredients), but they are all tasty.  My favourites are the pork bone soup, tofu soup, spicy squid, and the beef bulgogi. Again, not much variation in the menu but always consistent. Their Finch location is probably the best."}
{"text":"Glad I tried this place.  Servers speak cantonese but the food is authentic korean.  Tried the pork bone soup and enjoyed it.  There's the option to chose noodles instead of rice with the soup which is a nice option.  Would return here for a quick, inexpensive meal ($6-$7 per dish, lots of 1 dish meal options)."}
{"text":"Good eatin'  Had the pork bone soup: - It's pork bone soup alright. - Came with side dishes - Broth was nice - Pork was tender  8/10."}
{"text":"I come here for the Pork Bone soup.  Almost all the tables order that as one of their dishes.  When it comes, there is no surprise with 2 big pieces of Pork Bone and full of meat.  I can see the meat an inch above the bone.  Delicious.  I order the soup to be mild as I still not dare to try the hot one.  There are quite a lot of spices although I don't know what they are, it comes out to be tasty.  As I drink the soup, I can see the red chilli flakes floating around.  I pour some on my rice as well.  There is no complain - I want more potatoes!  Since it Is a small restaurant, it is easy to get the attention of the waitress."}
{"text":"Over the years, I have been to many authentic Korean restaurant and have to give The Owl of Minerva that their Pork Bone Soup is still the best in Toronto. Great service too."}
{"text":"Chicken Bulgogi on a hot plate was A+ .. tastes a little sweet and spicy. Served with side bowl of rice. Not too much food but satisfying.  The Beef Bibimbap  though was not that great, very bland, not served hot even in the stone bowl? need to spice it up with the rooster sauce.   A lot of people had ordered the pork bone soup, so we'll have to try it another time.   I don't frequent Korean restaurants that often .. off the top of my head  I've gone to Joons (yonge & sheppard) and 2 Kachi locations (spadina and bloor st) , Seoul Garden at pacific mall , Sariwon (yonge & clark) as the basis of my comparisons.   Service can be a little more friendlier and more attentive but the place is clean and the the bulgogi I ordered is ok so I'll try it again sometime."}
{"text":"Went here with three other people. Considering the previous restaurants that have inhabited the space, it was very nice to see owl doing so well! Clearly franchising works =).   The food:  Order was pork bone soup, pork soon tofu, and handmade noodle w/ sliced chicken. The servings were decently sized, a bit on the pricy side but taking into account the area it was still a cheap dinner. Food quality was pretty good the handmade noodles were chewy, which I enjoyed, but they were seriously lacking on the supposed veggies that were supposed to be in the soup. The banchan was practically non existent for a table of four servings small(4') bowl of three different offerings is bound to get some negative points.   The service:  The staff are very friendly and although they are new, the majority of them are great working with the limited resources that the restaurant has on hand. Seriously an Asian place that doesn't serve endless tea is really short changing (unable to maintain a large enough volume of tea and not enough pitchers).   Overall I would recommend coming here if heading down to yonge and finch is out of the question (take the viva if possible =D).  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Came here with my parents and my gf to introduce the 'rents to the joy of korean food. If only there was a Buk Chang Dong in Richmond Hill! Settled for some Minerva. That being said, the quality for the food is pretty decent with prices matching other korean places as expected.  We ordered a seafood and noodle dish for 4, I cannot remember the exact name of it though =/. Spicy level of the food was a bit lacking given that korean food is my go to food for tongue numbing awesomeness. Like my earlier statement, there are places that I feel do the mainstays of pork bone soup and bibimbap at a price point and quality level that exceeds Minerva. That being said Minerva isn't a terrible option either and I will and have returned since.  Total bill wasn't too bad for 4 people and we did leave with leftovers and full stomachs so no complaints there."}
{"text":"BEST KOREAN RESTAURANT EVER!! I come here whenever I find the time to.  The kalbi is so good that I order it twice just to satisfy my cravings.  It seems like the quality of their food is much better than other korean restaurants.  Place is a bit crowded though."}
{"text":"I always come here when I am alone for lunch. No need to wait. Easy Fast Inexpensive. I love their side dishes. Cant say the best. But not bad"}
{"text":"Worst worst worst owl of minerva i have been to!!!!!!! very different from other owl of minerva in toronto. Limited menu. Inattentive staff. Never check the table after serving meal, not even once. Didnt hear good bye/thank you after paid the bill. Bland tastless food, highly strongly recommend not to go this branch. Most korean restaurant provide at least 5-6 side dishes, here they give only 3 side dishes. There are other korean restaurants in richmond hill. Silimar price range but you get more and better food!! I and my friend got stomachache right after having dinner here (seafood contained dish) soup tofu soup seafood soup--sodium bomb seriously. Only little ingredients in soup. Mostly just salty spicy water! (Msg+salt+chili powder i guess)  Waste of money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Dont wanna give even one star!"}
{"text":"We had a quick dinner at The Owl last night. It's a nice little Korean place, and overall it was a good experience.  The negatives: *  poor and cluttered decor * where we were sited there was something spilled on the floor, so I think they could do better job cleaning the place * I'm very sensitive to smells, and I could feel the weird smell from the plastic sticks, so I asked for a fork.   Positives: * the food is very good and served fast * the stuff is very friendly * the prices are very reasonable, we paid $27 for two including the tip * all food is served with the complementary pickled cucumber, spicy turnip, and kimchi  We ordered spicy tofu-seafood soup and octopus steer-fry (mild). Soup was very very spicy and came boiling in a stone dish. Octopus was cooked very nicely. Both dishes came with a side order of steamed rice. They serve barley tea. Next time we'll try their famous Pork Bone Soup - it looks really nice.  It's a good place to order a takeout for a family or if you need to eat fast. Not for a  date or a special occasion."}
{"text":"This is the worst owl of Minerva ever.  I came into the restaurant late. They said its last call and In a very rush attitude. Then the food was so rush too and taste much worse then other location.  I don't feel like I'm a customer to be honest. Not recommend at all."}
{"text":"Loved this place! The service is great and prices are great as well! I had the pork bone soup. The pork was very chewy and soft and the flavor of the soup was spicy and smooth! I'm a huge kimchi lover and it tasted amazing! The ambience was quaint but the food makes up for it  For the price, this spot serves amazing food! Definitely worth checking out if you like korean dishes!   Overall rating: 4/5"}
{"text":"This is the new location. They moved from the finch location to this spot. The interior of this place is a lot newer.   we ordered a pork bone soup + spicy seafood soup. Both were flavourful. However, the one complaint I have with the seafood soup is that there is a lot more tofu in the soup than seafood. It was more of a tofu soup....    Overall, it's pretty standard compare to any other owl locations."}
{"text":"Food: 5.5/10 Atmosphere: 5/10  Service: 7/10 Overall experience: 5.5/10  When I see a 1-star review, I always assume that person was treated poorly, or something really negative happened on their visit to the restaurant. This is not the case - I just have much higher expectations for Korean food in Markham!  To be fair, I did not order the pork bone soup AKA what they are known for, so take my opinion with a grain of salt.   One of the best parts of eating Korean, is all the appetizers at the beginning of the meal. Owl only brought 3 dishes - Nak Won down the street brings 3 or 4 times that, so that was disappointment number 1.  My soontofu was hot, but lacked flavour. There was barely any seafood in it - I may as well have ordered spicy tofu and rice!  And while I don't expect much from Asian restaurants in terms of decor, and even cleanliness, Owl seemed old, unkept, and a little dirty. That \"hole in the wall\" atmosphere, but without the great food that makes those types of interiors tolerable.   THE BOTTOM LINE: disappointing Korean food in a dirtier than average spot."}
{"text":"We are regulars here now and this restaurant at this location specifically is the best Korean food you can get in Toronto along with the best service. This is now the only place I will go to for Korean food."}
{"text":"I love Korean dishes, especially the Beef ribs, It's really yummy. Personally, I can't take hot dishes, but still love their hot soup, it's very delicious !!   I think they are very cheap in price, but reasonable.  Because one dish is not enough for me, I found that their size of the rice bowl is way too small for me. I am a real rice lover, I wish they can give me one more bowl of rice free!   I wish they can renovate the interior design of the restaurant, it's a bit old.  If you don't mind about the environment, food is good and yummy! And their service is good too, the ladies who work there are just very friendly."}
{"text":"Except a long hair inside the soup, it was nice. The soup was replaced quickly. Maybe Sunday evening is not a good day for their well-known pork bone soup.. Side dishes on the table were two kinds of kimchi and seaweed salad only. Fast service."}
{"text":"Terrible food and service.   The best dish was the rice."}
{"text":"Had the gamjatang, flavour and colour was lacking. Pretty disappointed considering the other locations I've tried are pretty good.  Given all the other options for Korean food in the area, doubt I'll be returning.  Accepts Debit/Visa over $20."}
{"text":"I've tried Owl a long time ago at their location on Middlefield and Steeles (inside T&T) and I wasn't very impressed.  Since then I've been to many other Korean Restaurants and now revisiting Owl at their newest location on Steeles & Silverstar Blvd.  I must say I am thoroughly impressed with the food and service here.  I tried the pork bone soup, Dakchulpan and spicy ricecake with Fish tofu.  Pork Bone Soup - Tasty! not overly salty the broth is pretty clean.  The pork was very tender, came with some potatoes and cabbage in the soup.  Dakchulpan- like a korean chili chicken (forgive my lack of korean cuisine knowledge) It's a great dish to pair with rice, very flavourful, lots of chicken chunks as well as veggies (broccoli, onions, peppers)  Spicy Ricecake -  We ordered this with less spice. It was very good I personally like ricecake, I can see how it could be too chewy/an odd texture for some people.  The tofu it came with was really flavourful, overall a good carby addition to the meal.  I would recommend Owl for korean food in the area.  I would also like to note that the staff was more than exceptionally friendly and we felt like we were dining in a Korean family restaurant.  They asked us to refill our side dishes (which is great because sometimes i feel guilty asking haha) and ensured we had everything we needed to enjoy our meal."}
{"text":"Your typical trustworthy affordable Owl!!!!   Authentic Koren food, served by Koreans, run by Koreans.  Dishes running for around $10 along with rice for the most part and at least three side dishes (refillable; usually Kim chi, seaweed and Kim chi radish). Cold water or tea is free of charge.   They serve $5 Hite, Canadian, Bud and Coors. They also have overpriced Makgoli, soju and the ginseng one for $18 .. yep.. but people still order it!! And of course the asian aloe drinks and pop.  The food will never go wrong when it comes from Owl. Always good, fast and hot. The service is good, Koreans are well mannered and always carry a smile on their faces.   If you don't like rice much (like me) you can swap it for rice cake or dumplings!!!! Amazing I know :)   Clean place, affordable good food and good service .. why not! Oh but it gets hard to find a parking during lunch and dinner hours here at First Markham Place Plaza. Good luck snd enjoy!"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for! I have come to Owl of Minerva twice already and I've only come here to satisfy my craving for Korean food. I got their Tteokbokki, which is a traditional Korean dish that consists of soft rice cake, fish cake, and the sweet red chili sauce called gochujang. It was pretty good and it was sure spicy! I got the mild, but the spice was bringing tears to my eyes. I would suggest you get the milk if you can handle spice. I thought I could, but I guess I was wrong haha. It was a good amount of food for what I paid for. Their kimchi was ok and their other side dishes were mediocre. Their employees are very nice! They were very friendly and assisted us with all of our questions!"}
{"text":"Pork bone soup seemed to be the specialty here but I wanted to try something different so went for that sweet/spicy noodle dish with squid (cant remember the name! grrr...) and some chicken bulgogi. I was not disappointed with my choice and was quite happy to try something so interesting and tasty.  With the Korean staff, customers, and kpop shows on tv, I have to deduce that they serve pretty authentic Korean cuisine. t I actually found the non stop boy and girl band performances quite entertaining making my meal a memorable one.   Prices are pretty standard. around 10 bucks average per dish and you have the option to get bigger orders that serve 2-3 for $20. Not a bad deal at all. I'd recommend this place to anyone who wants Korean food."}
{"text":"You should expect the same great food and great service as the other locations.  We were not disappointed.  Regarding one of the other reviews mentioning people getting sick from spicy food you have to keep in mind there is some kick to this food.  You can always request no spice (but then what would be the point : )"}
{"text":"Its the owl you get what you paid for.  This location was a late night visit so was not busy although for some reason they still decided to seat 5 of us on a table for 4.   The food and service were quick but apart from that nothing to call home about."}
{"text":"First impressions: There are a lot of people eating here. Let's go in. *Goes inside* Atmosphere isn't that great. The restaurant is a bit dingy and it's pretty noisy. But let's give it a try. Servers were quite attentive and friendly. We ordered the chicken bulgogi, bibimbap, and tofu soup. The portions were pretty decent- small compared to some restaurants I guess, but it was a good size for me. The order came with some side dishes-- seaweed, turnips, kimchi, which were ok. I found the kimchi a little salty. Overall the food was ok. Nothing awful, nothing spectacular. The egg in the bibimbap was a little overdone, the bibimbap was slightly bland, and the tofu soup could have used more seafood/ veggies/ something other than tofu. Would have preferred more veggies in the chicken bulgogi as well. Also, extra spicy... wasn't that spicy."}
{"text":"Compared to other Korean restaurants in the GTA, I have to say this place really falls short. I much prefer Kachi or even Nak Won :/  They really skimp out on the meat for the beef bibimbap...  Compared to the other locations of the owl, the food is about the same, and the service at this location is actually worse than the one downtown.  If you do go there, ask for the reward/stamp card (gets you a free soup after 10 dishes or something like that)"}
{"text":"This is the newest owl in town but it is not as good as the others I been to.  They only give you 3 banchans whch is sad for a Korean place.  The pricing is a little more than the competitors but the size of the dishes is fair.  The place itself isn't that big so it can get crowded quickly and the parking lot can be tricky to park yoru car."}
{"text":"- Located on Bayview Ave (Bayview/Major Mac intersection), across a strip plaza of Shoppers Drug Mart - Limited parking available within the plaza  - Decor inside is very plain, simple - Restaurant size can fit around 30-40 people - Service is good, staff are friendly and nice  - Menu items are the same as their other locations For 5 people, we ordered 2 shareable pots - Pork Bone Soup and Army Style  Pork Bone Soup - not spicy at all (even though we didn't request spice adjustment) - comes with dumpling, rice cake, potatoes and veggies - meat was tender, boiled to the right level (plenty of quantity as well) - soup was alright, nothing too particular, but comforting and add a kick for the bowl of rice  Army Style - not spicy as well (no adjustments) - comes with spam, sausage, enoki mushroom, instant noodles, veggies - soup was alright as well - very comforting feeling, mixed well with all the ingredients together  - All 5 of us were pretty full from the meal - Banchan (side dishes) were good too, and can be refilled upon request (had kimchi, carrot, cucumber, bean sprouts)  Been coming to Owl for a long time at differ locations as well - this one is consistent with their other locations, so more convenient for others within the neighbourhood.  Tip - they don't usually give you the change when you pay in cash, remember to always ask."}
{"text":"I usually go to the location in North York as it is older one.  Once this one open up I came here more often as it is closer to my place.  The Gam Ja Tang is as good as ever too bad they do not have purple rice.  Price is good and Bulgogi is amazing!

{"text":"I've been to a few Korean BBQ before but never had this good of kimchi. The atmosphere is great. Super fast service. Amazing food that just make you happy."}
{"text":"HISTORY/ABOUT/DECOR: a 24hr Korean joint notorious for a mean pork bone soup (Gam Ja Tang). This location is nothing special, but it's not meant to be fancy or classy inside, it's meant to have some serious eats. The price point as well does not dictate an elaborate decor.   MENU DESIGN/FOOD QUALITY: The menu is well laid out, and in most cases there are pictures for the items which I find helps a lot of customers decide. I ordered the Gam Ja Tang (obviously) and it was ok. It is a pork bone soup with potatoes, green onions, ground wild sesames and a spicy broth.  It was missing something, perhaps some basic seasoning? I was just not blown away like my visits to other Owl locations. To add insult to injury the kimchi was bland and meh, tasted bitter and under seasoned. The other banchan (Korean side dishes) was nothing to write home about.   Many years ago I used to live with a Korean who's mom sent him food from Korea. I also hosted/cooked on a Korean TV show for a season on WOW TV, so I know my Korean food (before you ask who is this dude chirping the broth and kimchi). This location compared to the other Owl's is mediocre at best, and I won't be returning - until I know it is up to par.   PRICE POINT: You can walk out of Owl full for under 10$, similar to another famous Korean restaurant -  Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu, one of my Top 10 Restaurants in Toronto.   SERVICE: Very good. Attentive servers and quick results.   BATHROOMS: Clean and well maintained.   FINAL THOUGHTS: I very rarely write 1 and 2* reviews, but as mentioned before, this location was just not up to par and I  can not see myself returning. Having grown up in Richmond Hill I could not express in words how excited I was to learn there was an Owl near my house, only to be so let down.   (sigh)"}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner with a friend on her recommendation. The décor is bright and cheery and there is a TV playing k-pop performances and Korean variety shows. There is a huge wall with a menu / photos of the dishes. The atmosphere of this place is super casual, the staff were sitting at a table near the front eating dinner LOL and would get up to serve us if we motioned at them!   This is a great place for casual home-cooked style Korean food. I got the ramen (because I'm not very good with spice) and it tasted really good! The food arrived quickly and was piping hot. They have quite a large menu so there is lots to choose from. The portion sizes are huge as well so you're really getting value for money!  Overall recommended. I'd give this place 5 stars except it took forever to flag down our waitress (she was eating dinner and watching the k-pop show LOL)"}
{"text":"My husband lived in Korea for a year and says this is the most authentic Korean food he's had in the GTA.   The Owl of Minerva is a Korean franchise, always fresh, never made with MSG, and so delicious.  With the 20 degree temperature swings we've been having as of late, my husband and I decided to go for Korean food in Oakville.   Like all Owls we've been to (we used to frequent the one by Yonge and Finch when I lived in that area and again by Hwy 7 and Woodbine), this is a small mom and pop shop. They give you some small complementary appetizers (bean sprouts, kimchi, sweetened cucumber and turnips) and sweeten tea. Ordering is fast, and food comes out piping hot.  I got the pork bone soup, medium spicy. It comes with warm soup, large bones with tons of meats, and a potato. Yes, a potato. You mix in some rice, and consume. So delicious. So good.  If you want authentic Korean food, nothing fancy, but great taste and value - come to the Owl of Minerva. See y'all there!"}
{"text":"Came here twice for lunch with a friend. There was a small line up but we got a seat fairly quick. The place is a bit wider considered to the fmp location.  Amongst the two times we came, we ordered  pork bone soup, bibimbap, bulgogi beef, and their rice cakes. I liked everything especially the rice cakes. but I did find that the bulgogi beef was lacking. I haven't been to an Owl of Minerva for years, but I do remember the bulgogi beef having more meat and the sauce being less watery. But otherwise, it was great. My friend seemed to really enjoy the food as well.   Service wise, the waiter and waitresses were quite attentive. Our tea was constantly refilled, which was great. And they were pretty good about refilling the side dishes. I'd definitely come back again."}
{"text":"??????enjoy ????????????? ??????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"It is a great place to visit when you dont want to cook and dont want to drive far to eat!!"}
{"text":"I always go to the one in Central Parkway, I was so happy when this location opened.   Love the pork bone soup and Sundubu :D the best cheat day everyday. Not too far from work for lunch. The food taste fresh.  I can't wait for my next visit. :D"}
{"text":"Every time I crave owl, my boyfriend and I go to this location. We love the employees, they are super nice and friendly. We usually get the same order every time, the same amount of rice, and the same amount of dishes. But today, there was a new server who we recognized from the Yonge street location. She said no to our addition side order since we already ordered one already. Very disappointed because how we order everything is the exact amount that we would eat and it doesn't change. Wasn't happy about my order, and my service fkr getting brushed off like that."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my go-to Korean restaurants in my area. Great service with good food makes this a nice choice when you want Korean food, but aren't sure where to go.  They have one if the better pork bone soups, and good spicy bulgogi. If you ever get the chance, would definitely order something with the rice cakes, as they are well made, and always taste great.   Side dishes come with each meal, and are usually bean sprouts, kimchi, and kimchi radish (which are my fav), and you can get more upon request.  Overall a nice, small place with nice service to get some decent Korean food."}
{"text":"Worst Owl restaurant.  No any service. Food taste is not same as North York and Mississauga."}
{"text":"This was my first time having Korean food in Markham and I thought it was great! I came with my Mom and Dad and they were very impressed as well (this was their first time trying Korean food, period!)  Food:   We ordered the L.A. Kalbi Beef (which came with a bowl of rice), the Kamjatang (Pork Bone Soup, which also came with a bowl of rice) and the Spicy Dukbokki (which we ordered at the Mild level of spiciness, because my mom thinks that eating spicy food aggravates your skin :P) The Kalbi was great - as expected - marinated in that yummy Korean sauce that tastes both sweet and savoury at the same time and super tender. The Kamjatang was warm and filling on a cold winter's night and the broth was very flavourful! The meat was also quite tender and not at all dry (as it can be sometimes when you've boiled it for too long). The Dukbokki was the only disappointment because the rice cakes were a bit to soft for my liking (it would have been so much better if there was a bit more bite to it!) and the sauce was not nearly spicy enough. There are 3 heat levels - Mild, Spicy, and Extra Spicy - and perhaps I should have gone for the Spicy instead of the Mild....that being said, it wasn't only the level of spice that I didn't like, the sauce didn't seem to have much flavour in general....I was expecting the sauce to be packing a bit more of a flavour punch!   Service:  The service was quite nice at The Owl of Minerva. We went in on a Saturday night at around 7 and were seated promptly (although I'm not sure whether that's a good sign or not, usually you'd expect to see more people on a Saturday night, right?) Our orders were taken and our food was presented to us quite quickly and we were able to dig in with our cute little silver chopsticks and spoons (Chinese cutlery in restaurants is usually in plastic or porcelain).   Atmosphere:  This place seemed very much like a Korean restaurant. The walls were plastered with Korean posters of celebrities promoted an Aloe drink and the staff were all wearing a cute yellow uniform. We also thought it was really interesting that everything was rolled out to us on a cart, as we're used to servers bringing them out by hand. The feel of the restaurant was quite family-oriented and very homey, which I like and I thought contributed positively to the experience. One thing that I would mention is that you probably shouldn't wear your nice clothes to the restaurant though, as the smell of meat being barbecued will penetrate into your clothing.  Price:  All together, our meal came to EXACTLY $35 after HST (which I thought was curious :P) The Kamjatang came out in a portion size that I thought was appropriate for the meal, though I thought that they skimped a bit on the portion sizes for the Kalbi and the Dukbokki. I was also expecting to see a bit more rice cakes and meat for the price - for the same price (or probably a couple dollars less), I would have been able to purchase an overflowing lunch combo set from the food court at FMP. This may just be the Chinese mentality in me though, as this is generally the price you'd expect to see at other Korean restaurants. Another thing is that they also only served 3 dishes of Banchan (kimchi, pickled radish, and also some marinated seaweed). I've been to other Korean restaurants where they offered a greater variety of side dishes and wish that they could have given us this experience as well! That being said, they were all quite tasty (albeit quite strongly salted and sugared).  Overall, I thought that this place had quite tasty food, good service and a nice atmosphere. I'll probably try another restaurant next time I want Korean food though because their menu was quite limited and I want to explore new types of Korean dishes."}
{"text":"I'm a frequent eater at the owl in mississauga and its one of my go to restaurants, so i was looking forward to getting dinner at owl in markham. Buttt i was very disappointed the moment i got the menu. The menu is half the size as the mississauga one. They didn't have any of the items i wanted to get. I usually get the pork kimchi tofu dish, or kimchi soup (i forgot the real names for them LOL) but they didn't have either on their menu. Also today i wanted to try the kimchi pancake, but again they didn't have that on the menu. Another disappointment was that they didn't have the cucumber side dish, which is my favourite. And they didn't have the water jugs, and they only gave us each a small cup of water. Also the food came pretty slow even though the restaurant was a lotttt smaller than the one in mississauga. But on the bright side the food tasted great, in the end i got the seafood soon dubu, i loved it. And my brother got the pork dish (forgot the name) that was pretty good too. And we shared a tteokbokki. I also liked how you could choose the level of spiciness for almost all the dishes. The spicy seafood soon dubu had just the right amount of spice, it wasn't too spicy that it burned, but it had that nice spicy hit that i love. All in all, i wouldn't go there again and i would recommend people to drive the distance to mississauga if you have the time because its way worth it."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I probably go here once every two weeks for lunch and get the pork bone soup.  The service is great, the pork bone soup is AMAZING and it's cheap. The only thing that bothers me is the terrible Korean pop show that have on the TVs.  Update: I just tried their cold wheat noodle soup. A little sweet and sour, came with slices of pork, half a hard boiled egg and pickled cucumber. The noodles were really slippery and soft (in a very very good way). Perfect for today's 42ºC heat!!"}
{"text":"I order the pork bone that everyone raves about at this chain and it was probably the most saltiest and least flavourful pork bone soup I've ever tasted.  I got pork bone soup, that's for sure...with barely any meat on the bones.  I pointed this out immediately in a polite manner and it was quite blatant that they gave me bad pieces, but they said they give the standard three bones.  I pointed to my two other friends who got the same thing and much meatier pieces, but they just scoffed and walked away.  Staff were rude and cold."}
{"text":"The quality of the food has gone down significantly. The pork bone soup was very disappointing, the meat is not fall off the bones as before and the meat smells."}
{"text":"One word: blah. I've been to many locations of this chain and I've had positive experiences before. On a Sunday around noon, there were very few people in the restaurant - and for good reason. The store itself isn't the best looking and is not aesthetically pleasing.  I came here craving Korean food and ordered the Kamjatang (pork bone soup). It was priced fairly at $9.99, which is what you get it for at other Owl restaurants. The flavour was not what I had anticipated though. The broth was lacking depth and tasted very one toned. It was clearly not as good as other Owl restaurants.  My dad ordered the vegetable noodle soup, which is made with chicken stock, but for $9.99, it's really not worth the price! The noodles were average and the soup wasn't spectacular.  I was so excited that a Korean joint had opened near me, but then quickly disappointed that it lacked the traditional flavours of Korean dishes. Quite obviously, not coming back!"}
{"text":"Finally!  Korean resto in Oakville!  There's 2 tv screens showing k-Pop videos but the volume is turned down so you can enjoy the eye candy if you wish.  The decor looks like they inherited old wooden benches and painted bright white walls.  Just a weird collection of styles....  Ordered seafood pancake, seafood tofu soup, beef short ribs and bulgogi.  They brought all the dishes at once including 4 banchan (pickled radish, kimchi, bean sprouts, pickled cucumber).  All the food was good.  There wasn't nearly enough seafood in the pancake for the price they charged.  Most other places put in a generous portion of squid but it was almost nonexistent in this one.  The service was ok although there's always room for improvement.    Worth a visit when you feel like Korean food!"}
{"text":"I live in the area, not too far from First Markham Place and The Owl of Minerva is where I get my quick fix of Korean food. It's as good as it gets in the area for pork bone soup.  I only get the pork bone soup from here, everything else on their menu is so-so. Pork bone soup comes in a good portion for $9.99  Sometimes I get rice cake with it or the clear noodles, which are all good.  I like how you can choose the spiciness of their soup and it comes fairly quickly. You only get 3 side dishes (pickled seaweed, kimchi, pickled radish), which is a smaller selection than other Korean restaurants.  4/5 for the overall experience  5/5 for their pork bone soup"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in awhile, the service really improved. Normally, we don't get much service...   The food came really fast. Korean is famous for their side dishes! Make sure you don't get full from just eating the side dishes! I know how tempting they can get.   This time, I got the bibimbap and it was filled with flavours. I pretty much devoured my plate of meat and my bowl of rice. This is often my go to place for Korean!"}
{"text":"I've been to their locations in North York, Richmond Hill and Koreatown and this is probably their worst location in terms of the amount and the quality of the food.   We ordered their Pork Bone Soup and Bibimbap. The glass noodles in the Pork Bone soup were quite good, however the portion of pork bone was pretty small, especially compared to Nakwon, just next door. The pork bone at Owl was of slightly higher quality than Nakwon but still average.  The bibimbap was disappointing. Once again, the portion was quite small. There was plenty of rice, however the dish lacked toppings. There was barely any beef in it and I counted 2 measly slices of mushroom.   Although the food did taste good, I will likely not be returning to this location. I would recommend their North York location though!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for Korean comfort food, this is the place to be. Kimchi always on point and good selection of soups! Only downfall is that some dishes are pricey! But overall good food."}
{"text":"We were served a variety of banchan.  The kimchi was pretty good; not too spicy.  It came with a pair of scissors so that you could cut it up yourself.  I liked the red pepper and cucumber salad; it was vinegary.  The bean sprouts were also good.  The pickled radishes were standard.  The JapChae was a good portion.  The glass noodles were very tasty and firm!  I don't know if it's because I've been eating very clean lately but the seasoning seemed a tad strong and a little salty for me.  Either way, it was a good dish.  The service was fast and friendly.  There were lots of people here too on a Saturday night!  The place was packed with customers after our arrival."}
{"text":"Although it was a Monday night, there were a decent number of people dining in.   I was so impressed with the taste of the Pork Bone Soup!  I haven't had this in a while but I loved this one because the pork was so tender and fell easily off the bone, the broth was very delicious (I asked for mild spice), and it was just an overall very satisfying and delicious bowl!  It was served with white rice.  There was a huge single piece of potato inside the soup too.  I didn't end up finishing the PBS and luckily had some Tupperware inside my car to pack it.  For $9.99, it was such a great and cheap meal.  I'm totally coming back for more PBS in the future here!  I had forgotten how delicious it can be."}
{"text":"Have tried their dolsot bibimpap, bulgogi, yookae-jang, seafood pancake, and a few more dishes. Other than physically having to chase down the servers for a refill on side banchan dishes, their food is delicious. All. The. Time. If they could just have the servers check in on customers once in awhile, this would be a 5 star rating. It is a very casual diner with authentic Korean dishes that will please your palate. Just need to hire more servers!"}
{"text":"Very happy to see Owl make its way to Oakville.  Decided to give it a try and went for the standard beef bulgogi & Dakchulpan (spicy chicken).  Service was prompt we waited approx 10 minutes for our order.  The beef used in the bulgogi was melt in your mouth tender with just the right amount of seasoning.  The Dakchulpan was nicely spiced.  Prices are higher than other locations and portions could be larger for the price."}
{"text":"I have been to at least two other Owl of Minerva locations and had a pleasant experience. This place ended up being disappointing.   The prices are a little higher than I expected, especially with competitors such as 100% Korean very close by but I guess this is the franchise norm. Got a seafood tofu soup with rice which is typicallly one of my favourite korean dishes. They give banchan here, like every other Korean restaurant but they give only 4 kinds and they're all types of pickled veggies. I applaud them for the cost-saving, skimpy method. Where were my glass noodles, fishcakes and honey potatoes? That's what I would like to know.   As for the soup, it tasted bland and lacked the sour tones that I typically enjoy for this kind of soup. For 10.99 I really did expect something better. It did have a decent amount of seafood in it though. But the soup itself was definitely a miss.  I don't mean to be rude but the service was kind of pushy and they kept checking on us at awkward and frequent times. That's something I don't appreciate. Just let me eat and talk to my fellow diner(s) in peace please.   It's not the worst franchise location, but I don't see it being in my top books and I really don't see a good reason for coming back when there are so many other better and cheaper options nearby."}
{"text":"Lovely pork bone soup. It is the only place that I can get it with noodles instead of rice. Staff are nice but parking is bad. Only bad thing is not enough side dishes. Nak Won, next door, has many more side dishes but the pork bone soup is not as good as Owl's."}
{"text":"It's like all other owl of minerva's (except the one in waterloo on King St). Most owls will have avg food. This one is slightly above avg but I still wouldn't grant it a 3.5 rating. If you order a soup dish, sometimes your food will arrive lukewarm. Other times, nice and piping hot. I've ordered gamjatang (pork bone soup) here many times and it's never consistent. On my most recent visit, the soup was bland. Very bland. However, my friend ordered a different soup dish and his soup was quite flavorful and had a nice kick to it. Honestly, 3 stars is where I think owl should sit. It's open late which is a plus and always delivers affordability which I like. However, it just doesn't quite satisfy in the quality category. If you're on a student budget though you can't be choosy lol."}
{"text":"I always fiend for Korean food and thought I would switch it up a bit. We usually go to Nakwon a few stores down for my Korean fix.   Food is a bit on the pricey side in terms of typical Korean food pricing. We got the japchai, rice cakes, and chicken bulgogi. I always judge Korean restaurants based on their banchans and Owl drops the ball on this one. There's only 3 types of banchan. The standard kimchi, pickled radish, and seaweed salad. None are particularly good.   The chicken bulgogi is delicious with the perfect amount of spice. It comes with a side of rice. For the price, I felt that there wasn't a lot of chicken. The japchai is good, but there isn't a lot of meat (beef) in it. Japchai is usually a banchan at Jordan restaurant and this dish wasn't exactly cheap. I didn't really like the rice cakes. I've had much better at other places. A little cheap on the seafood cakes and vegetables and it wasn't saucy enough. There wasn't enough sauce to coat the rice cakes and they were a little plain for my taste.   Service was quick and very friendly."}
{"text":"super good food, the buddae jiggae is pretty awesome.  The rice cakes are chewy and satisfying.  Love this place."}
{"text":"I truly never thought this day would come, after over 1 year of yelping here it is ladies and gentlemen, my first 1 star review!   I came here with a friend to introduce them to the wondrous world of Kamjatang (Korean pork bone soup). We walked in on a Saturday night and the restaurant was fairly busy. We were seated promptly and our order was taken quickly. I ordered the mushroom kamjatang, my friend ordered the dumpling kamjatang (they have a few varieties of kamjatang; a special variety will run you about .50 cents more than the original). After a short period our food arrived, sadly this kamjatang was not up to snuff, the pork was dry, and the broth lacked any real flavour, it was more watery than anything. I ordered mine spicy and if what was brought to me is what they consider spicy than it is simply laughable, the soup had no kick whatsoever. A proper Kamjatang will have at least a medium level of spice but this one was mild at best. Lastly the portion size was ok but on the small side compared to other places I have been to. The extra .50 cents for mushrooms got me maybe 4 slices of mushroom not much more. In addition to the soup we got some banchan (complimentary side dishes) which consisted of a seaweed salad, kimchi and what I believe was pickled turnip (similar flavour to kimchi) all of these were nothing special.   The restaurant itself is sad and grim, something more suited to an Orwell novel rather than a plaza in Markham.* The service was attentive and all the waiters spoke great English. When it came time to pay I opted to pay debit, their debit machine is ancient and looks like the first debit machine ever put out on the market. My first attempt at payment the machine froze and I was assured my payment did not go through but lo and behold I checked my bank statement the other day and I see TWO identical charges from this place on the same day. Seriously most people opt to pay by debit or credit these guys need to invest in a machine that is from this century! Now I have to be inconvenienced to go back in my spare time and try to get a refund for the double charge, UGH! AVOID, AVOID, AVOID and if you must go be sure to pay cash.   * Sami is at war with the Owl of Minerva; Sami has always been at war with the Owl of Minerva."}
{"text":"An Owl franchise has opened in my pseudo hood, Scarborough.   Strolled in at 10:30pm on a Friday night and the place wasn't packed to the brim. Ordered tteokbokki and gamjatang. I can't eat spicy but the tteokbkki wasn't spicy at all. It was a bit sweet... which is a bit weird. Gamjatang was average.   The food was same ol', same ol' but what blew me away was the level of service at this location. Highly attentive staff that also speak great English. (Not like I had an issue with communication at the other locations). Definitely wasn't expecting this but they definitely upped the service standard!"}
{"text":"Owl seems to be opening up more and more in the west end and I'm very glad for it.  While I don't know what is considered true authentic Korean cuisine, I do like this place because the prices are reasonable, it's fairly clean and in my hometown of Oakville.  Being in Oakville, the service is better than the location in Mississauga (they actually asked how we were doing and were timely with tea refills).  Between me and my DC, we ordered the pork bone soup (#1) and rice cake with dumplings (#7).  I think the prices are a bit more expensive than the Mississauga location (though I could be wrong because the last time I went there was 2 years ago, so it may have changed) as #1 was $8.99 and #7 was $10.99.    With regards to the food, #1 was fairly big and had large pieces of pork bone (which is a good thing) and they gave you scissors to cut it up. The broth was tasty and there was very little MSG.  In terms of #7, well, you know those huge salad bowls they use to make a serving for 4-6 people? Yeah, that was the size of it and in a tin bowl to boo.  The dumplings were very good as they were hand made and also there was also very little MSG in this.     Overall, due to location (across from the Oakville GO station) and service, it was pretty decent.  Just don't bring a date here because pork bone soup is messy. :-)"}
{"text":"I would never walk in this restaurant again!!! There was one table left and we had 2 people. The table was for 4 but no one else was waiting. They wanted us to wait lol what a joke!!!!"}
{"text":"Best pork bone soup in town, I prefer the Yonge location.  The soup is very flavourful and rich. The pork was tender and moist. Would definitely be back!"}
{"text":"honestly freaking yum they give like 4 free side dishes I have went here twice and it is a solid Korean place to eat at a medium price. expect to spend around $10-$15 I got the dokbugi and the ramen before and they were good wouldn't get the dokbugi again because I've had better but the ramen is very yummy and it's $10  and I would get it again my friends got pork bone soup and it was also really good. the meat was tender and it includes 3 in each soup"}
{"text":"I like Korean food but am admittedly not a fan of chain restaurants. Put them together and you get a... disappointment.  Apps are disappointment (just sour crunches, kimchi, cucumber slices and beansprouts - WHERE ARE MY POTATOES AND GLASS NOODLES? Down the road at 100% Korean and/or Ga Bin is where. They also don't have fish cakes.)  The appetizers are such a big part of GTA Korean cuisine that this itself knocks it off a peg.  I had the pork bone soup as a main. This had decent flavour; the meat was very tender, but the potatoes not so much - they felt quite undercooked!  The bibimbap was also quite disappointing.  OWL is in a prominent location (facing Steeles Ave), but I think there are better options in the plazas next to it."}
{"text":"Huge selection of yummy Korean food and very reasonable prices. Bring your empty belly and be ready to be stuffed as their portions are above average."}
{"text":"Another Owl. Nice to see they finally got their sign up. Came for lunch with church friends today after church. I'm guessing it was around 1:15-1:30pm. They had enough space to comfortably seat the nine of us together. I appreciate that it's a clean environment and the ladies serving are very hospitable. They kept checking to see whether we needed more sides or tea.   Other than that, it's a fairly standard Owl. I had the soondaeguk (blood sausage soup) - $10.99. I asked for it not as spicy. It was fairly spicy. I didn't die, but I was a tad surprised at the amount of heat in it. Tasty though. Savory. On top of the soondae (blood sausage, but with more glass noodles in it than blood), there was also lung, pig ear, and what I believe was stomach in the soup. It was served with rice (which I did not eat). It also came with hot pepper paste and salted shrimp sauce. Warning, the salted shrimp sauce is super salty. Use sparingly.   For the kpop fans among us, they have two TV's. Today's program was M Countdown. I only recognized Astro and B1A4. Mostly newer groups though.  I'll probably be back. It's a nice alternative for Gabin.  Logos note: Credit card can be used if you buy over $20, and they do not split bills. No wait the last time we came. Can handle larger groups."}
{"text":"was craving for korean food so decided to come on a friday afternoon and it was packed. got seated when we got in.  i order pork bone soup and my sister order hers (i forgot what she got). pork bone soup was amazing. definitely would come back again."}
{"text":"Owl of Minerva in oakville?! I did not realize this chain extended out of Toronto. (I later drove by their Hamilton location, OOM is everywhere!!). i enjoyed a delicious bowl of bibimbap. Tasty side appetizers. Fast service. Reasonable prices. A great place to enjoy Korean food. Steadily busy but not overcrowded and no difficulty getting a seat."}
{"text":"Probably the worst time that I've ever had my bulgugi soup. The base was tasteless, I asked for no onions or peppers I end up getting peppers. The beef in it did not look appetizing. It was supposed to come with the dumpling and there wasn't any. The glass noodles in the soup was literally a couple of strands. I use to get 3X the amount of glass noodles!!!   They are giving less and less side dishes now. Yes you can refill but it'd still be nice to have variety...  The short ribs on the other hand was great. The meat just fell right off the bones. I feel like some of the short ribs can have less fat or could of been cooked a little longer.   Will I go back I don't know maybe to a different location"}
{"text":"After eating at the Owl of Minerva a couple of times, my last visit definitely warranted a review. Although the Owl of Minerva is consistent with their food (simple korean dishes that you normally expect), the service can be inconsistent. The service during my first few visits in earlier years was decent but nowadays, I've noticed a downfall. After my friend and I sat down on a table and ordered, 4 friends came in and the manager told us to move since we were only two people, despite there being an empty table for 4 right beside us. Although we didn't mind this, afterwards, the other table also got their food first and were served much more attentively. In addition, while the group of 4 paid first, the servers had a calculation error - forcing us to pay 20 minutes later and made us late for an event afterwards.  However, I do recognize that servers are people and that everybody can have their bad days so please take this experience with a grain of salt as servers have been much more attentive before - I just wanted to share this experience. My overall rating? The price is a little high and the service can be a little slow, but the food is pretty consistent :)"}
{"text":"What a pleasant little surprise to find an Owl all the way out in the Oaks.  Nice clean little place with very pleasant service.  Dolsot Bibimbup  and the Duk-Mandu-Gook were both on point.  The Banchan was fresh and tasty.   I still have to try out their PBS so I will be back.  If it all works out,  I think this will be my new Owl go to.  The restos got a coupla big screens for your viewing pleasure too.  Don't forget to check out my pics.  They got free wifi.  PW: 187cross Peace out my fellow Yelpers!!"}
{"text":"Every time I come in to this restaurant I am amazed with the food. Real feel-good homemade Korean food. Reminds me very much of what I ate as a kid. Great variation of sweet, spice, and savoury. I will definitely be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a thursday night around 8.30pm, there was no wait. The restaurant wasn't full and there were a few tables left opened. The decor was minimal, CP24 plays on the tv screens and it was a bit hot inside. We put our orders in quickly and the staff was quick.  There were side dishes of kimchi, pickled radish and a seaweed salad (which I was personally not a fan of)  I got the seafood tofu soup for ($8.99) it came in the black pots boiling hot, it had a shrimp, a mussel and a few de-shelled clams and a good amount of soft tofu inside. I asked for spicy but it wasn't that spicy, however it was quite salty and tasted ridden with msg. It was also missing the raw egg to be cracked and dropped inside. My friend got the stir fried spicy chicken on sizzling plate, it came with a good amount of chicken and veggies, again it wasn't very spicy. Both dishes came with a bowl of white rice.   For the price it felt ok but their yonge and finch location is definitely much better!"}
{"text":"Though the space is quite small, as long as you arrive an hour or so outside peak hours, you'd be able to get seated quickly.   Glass noodles, beef bolgogi, pork bone soup very tasty. Kimchi is good too  Kimchi rice is not so much our type though but not bad. If you're used to yang chow fried rice then kimchi rice would have less of the flavour.   Food server very courteous. Been coming here often whenever we are in the area."}
{"text":"This locations pork bone soup is one of the best in.comparison to the other franchisee location. Service is great and fast.  Totally recommend it. Only downside is it is not 24 hours."}
{"text":"This is a great little restaurant. Its a welcome addition from what is becoming a small chain. The place is cheery and well light, and the service is friendly, prompt and pleasant.  We were 3 diners and we all settled on Pork Bone Soup. This is a plentiful offering which is presented with sides of pickles, kimchi and rice. The soup was hearty, meaty and well-flavored.   We also ordered what can be best described as a 'omelet' made with kimchi. It was spicy tasty and very filling.   Overall, for a quick meal, how can you go wrong!  I will return again and again."}
{"text":"The pork bone soup is defintiely worth a try.  For cheap eats, this is a good place to go for some Korean food.  I liked the pork bone soup.  My hubby tried the bibimbap and he didn't like it.  According to him, it's too bland and no texture.  It doesn't have an authentic Korean taste to it."}
{"text":"this is by far the worst owl of minerva i have been to. at first i liked their bibimbap but after trying other places i have come to realization this restaurant does no good in the bibimbap department. i tried the mandoo (steamed dumplings) and they were pretty alright, after a while (which didn't take very long) they got cold and the outer layer become like rubbery hard) i also tried their kimchi jigae (SOUR AS HELL) and the seafood jigae ( NOT VERY GOOD EITHER)   their side dishes were pretty standard, nothing special (i found a hair in my food x( )"}
{"text":"This was actually my first time eating at an Owl. I got a pork bone soup ($9.99). The flavor of the soup was good but although I chose it to be spicy, I didn't think it was that spicy at all. So make sure to ask for extra spicy if you like some heat in your food.  The servers here walk past your table without even glancing in your direction. You can imagine it was quite hard flagging down a server.    The food came fast after we ordered. Everybody at my table got a pork bone soup but only 2 out of the 4 orders came out bubbling hot. Also, not all the orders came at once. I like places that brings everybody their food at once so there is no waiting needed before digging into the meal.   Overall not a bad place to get your pork bone soup fix. I have no idea how the other items stack up but I'll visit again if I'm nearby and am craving some pork bone soup."}
{"text":"Not sure what has change in the last year or so but the taste is not there anymore.   Two years ago or even longer, it was served mostly by Korean aunties....the tofu seafood soup was always spicy and delicious.   Recently, I went there about three times within the last few months and thought each time perhaps it was a miss just that night but the flavour is just not that good anymore...... haven't been back since January.   Very sad - use to be my fave go to in Oakville."}
{"text":"Comparatively with the many Korean restaurants around, Owl of Minerva's menu doesn't offer much. But what it does offer is traditional Korean dishes that tastes great. I grew to love Korean food when I first stepped into their first restaurant in K-town.  It's a small cramped restaurant and waiting at the front can get quite awkward.   For the meal, there are only several appetizers that are brought to the table. (Not as much as Nak Won)  I love the kim chi that they make though.  I usually stick with the famous pork bone soup. It comes steaming hot and the broth is so flavourful, it's hard not to finish the bowl. There is plenty of meat and cabbage for you to eat and devour. Best pork bone soup in town!  Note: Is it traditional for rice to be served in metal bowls? It's the work of science that heat conducts throughout the bowl. I can never pick it up when it is served to me."}
{"text":"I ordered the Vegetable Soon Tofu soup even though it wasn't listed on the menu anywhere. The service was great in the beginning, the waiter kept an eye on the table as he was working and kept coming out to check.   I ate as I watched K-Pop and some random posters on the wall, one of which read, \"This is not a real paper\".  Really? Tell me more about life.   I got 3 banchans with my order, and though the extremely garlic-y kimchi was delicious, the pickled cucumber was pretty shrively and sad.  The dish itself, though slightly more expensive than competition, was made with fresh vegetables and the level of spice was perfect. I would have loved purple rice and a large amount to equalize the amount of soup.   The new waiter towards the end spoke a very limited amount of English and it was pretty hard to communicate with him so I resigned to a smile and a nod. I'll definitely return when the mood for some k-pop and some soon tofu strikes."}
{"text":"Not the best Owl of Minerva in the city. Food and services subpar to the one in North York."}
{"text":"Food is acceptable. Horrible service. Came as a group of six. A dish came and it was not what we ordered. An unfortunate miscommunication most likely. However the server insisted that she heard right and we didn't order what we said we had ordered... What's the point really... Never coming to this place again."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: small, good location, usually pretty decently cleaned, today I found a bug inside my tea though...  Food:  1. spicy udon seafood noodles: perfectly spicy, seafood came from one of those groceries mixed seafood bags at the supermarket, a bit disappointed in that. Overall though, the sauce was delicious, which made up for everything else   Price : 11.00  Overall: owls is known for being a bit pricer, but it's a staple place. So I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I have frequented this location for years and prefer Owl over Nakwon any day, but what we experienced on Sat Mar 11 was absurd. We were a table of 5, with two seniors. When I arrived, part of our party was already seated. Our family wondered why no tea or water was brought over once we were seated. We tried to call a waiter several times, but it was not only difficult but when we did get their attention, an older lady yelled across the restaurant \"order first!\" We were taken aback to this treatment and realized they had a rule that you must order before people at your table can have water (nazi?).  Joking aside, we then ordered right away as requested so we could have this precious water. After 5 mins, the same older lady came to our table and asked us to move our party to a smaller table because she said it would get busy. This was at 5:30PM and more than half the restaurant was empty and on top of that, we had an 80 year old and 91 year old grandmother with us. We argued that it's very early and making them move is not appropriate especially since the table we were given was in the corner and really only fit 4 people. We even promised to finish at 6:30 but still the waitress would not budge or show understanding...only following her orders. Finally, we decided to leave and the waiter almost showed a look like she was glad we left. This is sad...ah well, I guess I'll go to the other 2 Korean restaurants in the same plaza."}
{"text":"I love that they let you order rice cakes in their pork bone soup. :) it's simple and delicious and you can modify the spicy levels which is great! They are fast, and always smiling, making for a great atmosphere to sit and enjoy a meal with friends and family.    The food is hardy and great, especially for winter! Parking is horrible but that's normal for this plaza.  The rest of the menu is good too, but nothing special. So when I go, I'm really just craving the same order every time. I like the jap chae noodles with a lot of the chili sauce too!"}
{"text":"Sheesh I wish I could rate a half star cause Owl of Minerva is a solid 3.5 stars.   Firstly they're a franchise so the food you get (willingly) is the same you get all the time.   Secondly, their service is quite good - always there when needed.   Thirdly - the flavours are amazing - big thumbs up for this place out of this world. Big yum yum!"}
{"text":"Wanted a soup that would warm me up on a cold fall day in Toronto.   Opted for my go to Jim Chai Kee but they were closed so resorted to my nearby backup for a tenderly delicious pork bone soup.   Place was busy. It was 9:20pm. We were promptly greeted and seated. Ordered up within another 5 minutes but the food did take about 10-15 mins to arrive.   The broth is - amazingly good. The pork bone is very delicious. Don't be scared to grab the bone and strip it with your mouth. You will be peasantry rewarded.   The flavours are spot on. The broth consistently good. The meat - OMG - so damn good. Just falls off the bone.   Although a chain, this place is dope so go check it out."}
{"text":"The Owl of Minerva is one of my go-to places for Korean Pork Bone soup, especially since they have so many locations. I can generally count on consistency but I feel like their Yonge/Finch location does it a little better than the other ones I've been to.  On this visit, I was introducing a friend to this delicious soup but she opted for the beef rib soup instead. We also had some deep fried Korean pork dumplings. Both soups were served boiling hot, something I've become used to with Korean cooking. The flavours were very good and the portions were large enough for my friend to take home half of it.  Overall, it was a good experience. The restaurant was bright and clean. The service was quick, friendly, and very attentive, with servers checking on us several times."}
{"text":"If you like Korean Pork Bone Soup (KamJa Tang), try Owl of Minerva. I've had it at a couple of their locations and it's been consistently good and delicious. Good price, too! Maybe I'll try some of their other dishes next time. ;)"}
{"text":"I usually go to the one in Hamilton. This one wasn't as good. The place is pretty clean. It took us forever to get the waitresses attention to get something. The spicy bulgogi was not spicy at all. Dumplings were good. You are not allowed to split the bill (\"one bill per table\") and it's a $20 minimum to use debit. Quite a weird restaurant."}
{"text":"My friends and I call ourselves the \"Oolong Papa Family\" (long story).  Anyhow, obviously, we enjoy food.. Back when we were in Waterloo, we would always go and get Korean food at the local Korean restaurants.  My friend was in desperate need for Kamjatang (pork bone soup - or as my other friend calls it \"PBS\").  Anyhow, we head to the location at First Markham Place since it was a) in between my friends and I; and b) better parking.    It's your typical Korean place.  Appetizers are always a plus: kimchi, pickled seaweed, and spicy turnip (my favourite!)  Two of my friends order the kamjatang, one friend orders the bulgogi, and I order a different dish from the usual: the ojingo bokeum.  Basically, it's stir-fried spicy squid.  I've been having a squid/octopus affinity in the last few months, so I had to try it.  I thought it was great.  However, I asked for mild, and it still seemed pretty spicy.  I wonder if it's because I'm becoming more weaksauce in terms of spicy food.  Nothing really TOO special, but it was a good dish to fill me up.  My friends said the kamjatang was really good.  Better than the one located at Yonge and Finch.  The meat apparently just fell right off the bones, and there was a lot more meat -- so they were happy about that.  Service wasn't bad either -- they were quick to come by with more appetizers when we requested for more.  Cheap food and quite filling!"}
{"text":"Best pork bone soup.. Yum  Good and fast service.  Great food.    The place can use some renovation (new chair) but it doesn't bug me as a regular customer"}
{"text":"I think I would give them a 3.5. If I could describe my experience, it's a stable. Nothing wow or disappointing from this restaurant, just an average good hearty meal.  I personally like the taste of the Owl on Yonge Street more. However, Markham location was alright.  Service was fast with refillable side dishes (kimchi, seaweed, radish). The place was clean."}
{"text":"This is their newest location.  After being introduced to the \"Owl\" at Yonge and Finch, I've also tried the one at First Markham Place. Well, let's just say, if I was disappointed by the one at FMP, then this one is a new low...at least for the \"Owl\". If you're expecting it to taste the same as the one at Yonge&Finch, then you'll be up for a big surprise.  the spices are the same, but the meat is nowhere near \"fall off the bone\".  Maybe it's because it's new and they don't have it boiling 24hrs/day like the other location, but this one was just down-right disappointing. I would pass on this one....go to the FMP location if you're already up here...but if you don't mind the trek, go to the one at Yonge and Finch."}
{"text":"I must say I had high hopes for Owl of Minerva, since the one at Yonge and Finch is fantastic (food at least, not the \"ambience\" and \"Cleanliness\").  I had their famouse Pork Bone Soup.  This one at FMP was small, and the meat wasn't boiled for a long time...so needless to say, getting the meat off the bone took a long time, and it just took the \"joy\" of eating pork bone soup out of it.  There isn't much kimchi dishes either. I would pass on this location and make the trek to the Yonge/Finch one, or go next door to Nak Won."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre. Their table cooking menu doesn't have enough variety. I had the kimchi fried rice which was too little and overpriced.  Probably won't come back."}
{"text":"Cold Canadian winter and hot Korean food is a match made in heaven.    It was freezing.  We wanted food that made our bodies burn, so we went for hot (temperature) and spicy (taste) Korean food.  Mom ordered a stone bowl bibimbap.  I ordered a squid with rice, served on cast iron plate.  There were 3 choices of spiciness: green chilli (mild), orange chilli (spicy), and red chilli (very spicy).  I chose orange chilli.  It was VERY spicy to me.  Lesson learned: this location of Owl keeps the authentic level of Korean spiciness. There is no wimpy watered down spiciness here.  Now that I have gotten the warning out of the way, I can brag about the food.  I love the spicy squid.  It tasted devious.  The squid was not over cooked.  It was still soft.  The sauce was rich.  I loved mixing the sauce with the rice.  My mom loved the bibimbap, though I thought the rice was a bit too soggy.  I also wish they used better grain.  Both entrées were well portioned.  This is a hole in a wall.  Services was customary down to earth yet sufficient.  There is no pretentious classiness or ambiance, and I like it just fine."}
{"text":"! It's not like the one in Korea but it's a great substitute and it's in my neighbourhood so I'm happy. The staff are very welcoming and helpful. Great place. It's a bit pricey but so is everything here."}
{"text":"We were in the area and wanted Korean food. The choices were either Owl or Nak Won. We chose Owl. I got the pork bone soup. The portion was at par with other Korean restaurants, the soup was good and the meat was tender. One thing I really liked was that my soup came out bubbling hot! There were less banchan here compared to other Korean places (only 3) and the menu here is considerably smaller.   The servers here weren't attentive. The restaurant was only half empty and they didn't even look our way. It was like they were purposely ignoring us.   I don't think I'll come back as there are better places."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for quite a while now and every time I come, it seems the quality of food gets worse and worse. I mean, it's still decent food but it isn't the same as it once was. The prices are average but the side dishes have gone downhill. They used to give 5 or 6 side dishes back in the day and now they are down to three. I got 3 cubes of radishes, seaweed and kimchi. I missed the days where they give you some fish cakes and potato side dishes too!  I ordered the pork bone soup as usual which is fine. It's average at best. The pork was tender and the broth had just enough spice. Good place to grab a quick bite but don't expect too much."}
{"text":"I will no longer be frequenting this location. Here is why.  I've been coming to this location for a couple years now since the location was convenient. As for the taste, it seems to suit the non-Korean pallet better as this place is often frequented by those that are not Korean. Koreans generally choose elsewhere (from what I have been told from my Korean peers) for Korean food when there is an option.  Over 90% of my visits here have been take out. Recently they have upped their prices across the board from $1-$2 when their prices were already on the higher end for a casual establishment like this. On top of this, they have reduced their portions from 25%-33% depending on the dish.  With the price increase, portion decrease and very mediocre taste (my opinion), there is no longer a reason to support this establishment.  On a positive note, I will say that their service has always been very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Got the usual bibimbap and pork bone soup. Nothing really stood out for me. One thing that really disappoints me though is the lack of side dishes. If I can get the same quality main dishes at let say \"Nak Won\" right next door and pay the same price but get way more side dishes then its a no brainer for me. I choose the one with more side dishes."}
{"text":"Had a very nice dinner here tonight.  Ordered the Japchae and Kalbi!  Prices are very reasonable.  Although the menu isn't very big there will be some Korean dish that should serve your appetite well!  3 banchan dishes aren't anything exciting but are adequate.  Staff is cheerful and pleasant.  Sure I'd return!"}
{"text":"Worst Korean food ever, waited 45 mins for the seafood pan cake, but get pan cake full of green onion and few seafood finnaly and cost us 16.99. Never come back to this location..."}
{"text":"I came here last weekend for dinner and it was a good experience. The restaurant was clean and bright with several booths and tables around. I would compare it to being about the same size as the Mississauga location. This location definitely had more of a quiet atmosphere compared to the other locations which are much louder and busier in comparison. This Oakville location was a nice change!  My husband and I had our go to dishes: the pork bone soup and the bibimbap. Both were tasty enough, filling and were great portions for the price. The pork bone soup was a bit underdone for my liking and spicier than I was used to in past visits at the other locations but my husband enjoyed it. It was not as fatty as other times I've had this, which was a good thing. The bibimbap was decent in flavour and tastes the same as other locations.  Service was good as well - no complaints there. Servers were efficient with getting the appetizers and dishes out in reasonable time, as well as were polite. Overall, I would come back if I was in the area and craving Korean food."}
{"text":"I buy from this Owl on Sunday's when my go to place is closed. It does the job if you're really feeling like pork bone soup but it's certainly not impressive.  Price and portion is fair but taste can definitely be improved. I hope to see them do better over time."}
{"text":"I would typically give a good review as the last few times I've gotten take out has been good. Except today after finishing my pork bone soup I found a bug in my soup. Unfortunately we ate all the food already luckily didn't drink the soup but it left me feeling sick. Sure bugs aren't bad for us per say but this is unhygienic and gross."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a Thursday and it wasn't too busy. We were greeted promptly and led to a booth seat. My first thought was that the seat was a bit hard and uncomfortable but I hardly noticed after a while.  We ordered 3 dishes - bulgogi, pork bone soup and rice cakes. All 3 dishes were around $10.  The rice cake was very interesting because it was in a sweet and spicy sauce. It was a bit too spicy for me to handle but from the few that I could eat, it tasted good. It was nice and chewy and I liked the sauce. I would recommend this dish to share.  The bulgogi was nothing special. Again, I liked the sweet sauce that it was marinated with it but my mom can make this dish any time. For a lunch special, it was kinda pricy and it didn't come with a special drink or side. I'm not sure how this is considered a lunch special...  The pork bone soup is also nothing to write home about. I can say it's not overly salty so that's a plus. However, I've had more flavourful pork bone soup elsewhere. Also, it only came with one potato in the soup which was kinda disappointing.  It's nice to have a Korean option near my house. However, I wouldn't come back until they have some real lunch or dinner specials!"}
{"text":"Probably won't be coming back. The food was ok, not that great. I really don't have much else to say about this establishment to be honest. I think the pork bone soup was over-hyped unfortunately."}
{"text":"Summary: This is a place to come to for the food, not as much for the ambiance.  Walked into this one on a lark. Didn't even check if is had any reviews on Yelp. Liked it. Came back a couple of days later.   The food is authentic (at least it felt that way -- I'm no expert on Korean cooking), good quality and great value.   Dishes we've samples so far: - Seafood soup (spicy!) - Fried octopus (yum!) - Pork bone soup (their signature item -- delish!)  There are a number of specials that include a meal and four bottles of domestic beer with very little markup from what you'd pay at the LCBO. I didn't see anyone take advantage of that deal though as they don't advertise it much at all.  Most entrees are $8-$12. There are \"family size\" options too good for 2 and maybe even 3 people.  You get unlimited grain tea, kinchi, marinated cucumbers and radish with your meal.   For payments, they accept VISA but they DO NOT accept MasterCard."}
{"text":"Wanted to try the rice cakes. Ive had rice cakes from 5 places this month because I'm so in love with it. This place was okay... Very very greasy with a watery soup like sauce. I prefer the thicker sauces. I also ordered their stir fried chicken. Both dishes had the same tasting sauce, vegetables.... There's a lot of vegetables. Enough that if you wanted to eat just a plate of rice cakes, I think it would be a decent meal. However, ive never eaten food with SO MANY ONIONS!!! UGH. I have to pick them out... Also the rice cakes had 3 levels of spice. I choose the highest and don't find it spicy enough."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night was quite busy every table filled. There's no service here they just dropped random things off at the table and yell thank u when u walk out the door lol as we were eating an employee was cleaning the washroom with bleach and the 3 tables around us could no longer eat the smell was so strong. We all started to chat to one another about the situation. One of spoke up and they closed the washroom door only helped a bit.  There's an older Asian lady that works there don't ask her for anything she's super moody and completely rude and she doesn't hide it lol it's actually funny to watch. But I wouldn't want to be the table beside me that ordered no onions and still got onions. Once they told the older woman she just kind of stood here made a face and was like no onions?? No onions??? No onions?? She then grabbed a plate and tongs and tried to pick most of the onions from their dish right there at the table. So many onions her plate of onions was over flowing and the poor people still picking more out when she stopped. She must be the owner for sure. Because of this experience I happened to meet some great people being the tables around me.   Portions here are smaller than the one on Yonge st and finch area. Same price"}
{"text":"This is my second time eating at Owl chain restaurant, the first being the Scarborough location. I had originally wanted to try the tofu house few stores down but they were sold out of rice when we went so we decided to go to Owl because we were really craving Korean. I figured there would be no surprises because it's the infamous Owl and I was right. Food is on par with the other location I've tried. They had customers coming in even at 3pm (way past lunchtime) while the staff were even setting up for their own lunch. Anyhow, there was only one lady serving the crowd at that time. She attended to us when we waved her down (she memorized our order in her head without having to write down anything which was impressive) and our food came promptly. The taste is pretty generic I would say (ordered bimibap, pork bone soup and soon tofu seafood) as expected. However, although the prices are the same at all locations, I felt it was kind of overpriced for what you get. They don't refill drinks, food is pretty salty (lots of msg), gives banchan only one per person, and the décor was dated, floors felt grimy. I honestly don't feel the need to come back as there are cheaper options for Korean that taste pretty much the same in the food courts inside FMP."}
{"text":"This place cranks out a lot of pork bone soup.  I had the chamchi-kimchi-chigae (tuna) and there were HUGE and generous pieces of tuna in there, lots of baechu kimchi and tofu and lashing of gochu (hot pepper flakes) per my request. Also lots of garlic.  Garlic+gochu - what's not to love.  Mmmmmm.    I would go with the traditional Korean ttukbegae dishes here - sudufus, chigaes and jongols.  The other fried dishes looked quite oily.  Nice owners, baechu kimchi was fresh and delicious - cucumber kimchi a bit sweet for my taste.  But for me, its all about the ttukbegae - and it was good.  Spouse's hwae-mool sundubu was fresh - and had two very large mussels - but not enough variety of seafood (no squid ...).  Would have given them four stars - but the lack of squid and other seafood in the hwae-mool sundubu brings them down to a 3 ...  My chigae, however, was truly delish."}
{"text":"Love going here after a night out and needing some good food to sober me up. The Bulgogi is amazing"}
{"text":"Nothing out of the ordinary. We got 4 side dishes and pretty standard Korean food. Service was average and food was average. I suppose you can't go wrong with coming here for a late dinner. We ordered the bulgogi and kimchi tofu stew. Both met the standard of Korean food. Parking is less difficult at night. Like all owl restaurants, it was average but did the job."}
{"text":"Outstanding!!!   Hot fresh well made food served by friendly and courtesy staff.  We come to this location only after our first visit sometime back.  Good amount of seating and parking."}
{"text":"The food was really good here, nice and spicy and freshly prepared.  The food came out quickly and was very hot.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Another midnight munchies craze. I hope this will live up to all the other franchises out there. As there was many other Japanese or Korean crazes at that restaurant. I just hope this one stays around but they do face a lot of competition. I just hope those who need a feast after going to the gym will be hungry. I hope they survive and prosper."}
{"text":"The most bland and tasteless dish I've ever had. Ordered the beef hot stone bowl and it actually made me lose my appetite. The portion for the beef was literally a spoonful and the entire contents of it was so bland! It actually tasted like nothing. I couldn't even finish it. $10 wasted.  My friend had the pork bone soup and she thought it was decent but said that other owl locations were much better. Guess were never going here again."}
{"text":"Great \"fast food\" Korean restaurant.  I pretty much only do takeout here because it's always busy and if not, I'm it a big fan of the McDonalds type seating.  The food thought is great Korean food from what I know.  The staff are all Korean and I usually either get pork bone soup or some bibimbap dish.  I've recently been getting their ginseng chicken soup (for the cold weather!) and it comes with a whole little chicken in the soup!  It's a nice clear broth, tasting very natural and great for a cold.    Glad they are in Richmond Hill!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of the food here. Its a really small place, but I think theres a perfect variety of items. The service is also excellent. Whenever I come here, they are happy and friendly :)   One of my recent food cravings is Dukboki- I havent really looked around for other places that offer it, but this is where I go for it. Im seriously just happy to know a place that has it..Its good enough to satisfy my craving so Im happy.   On my most recent visit (this review), we got dukboki, Spareribs, and a spicy chicken (cant remember the exact name!). Everything was incredible for me. The only issue I had that that the sparerib meat was a little inconsistent. Some pieces were tough while others were really tender. Im not a butcher or anything, but im not inclined to believe there is any reason for this other than the meat not being cooked enough. Feel free to somehow correct me if I am wrong!  The spicy levels are tolerable here. Im not sure if they toned it down for me or anything, but it was definitely not death-level spicy like Ive had at other Korean restaurants. Maybe of you like it that way you should ask them to make it \"really spicy\". Just a thought."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here after I read some reviews about how good the pork bone soup is so we came to try it out. After we left the restaurant to grab some bbt we noticed the popularity of the soup exploded as you can see posters of 'try out new pork bone soup for only $4.99' are on there windows.   Damn they were right. It was delicious. There was plenty of meat in it and the soup tasted so good that my gf used it in her bibimbop. Even though the soup had kimchi in it it wasn't spicy at all which is what we like (you can ask for more spice or mild). The bibimbop didn't have as much beef as other places we've tried. There are just 3 appetizers they serve. Radishes or glass noodles would be nice but they don't have them. there are so many other menu items i'd like to try and we'll definitely be coming back sometime soon.   Overall the service is friendly and they serve our food quickly. They are an authentic Korean resto with a lot of traditional dishes. I'd be a regular here for sure if this was closer to where I live."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes ordering takeout for tonight & for the most they fulfilled my craving for PBS.  I ordered 4 gamjatang and one toppoki and everything was cooked nicely. There were at least 3 large bones with lots of meat on them for each container and brimming with soup. The toppoki was chewy and tasty ... yummmmmmm.  That is until my sister found a hair elastic in one of gamjatang?!????????????????????!  Biggest turn-off of life. I can suffer through small portions, somewhat bland flavours, or even slightly dirty tables from the restaurant .. but finding shit in my food that's not supposed to be there?   0% chance of me being back to this location.  (Picture of elastic will be posted)"}
{"text":"Owl has been a hit or miss across the GTA so I thought I'd come in to try the one in Oakville.   The parking lot is tiny so avoid rush hour as there's other stores that share a strip of parking.   The store is clean and obviously an owl store. The waitress was friendly.  Menu is very standard - pork gone soup, tofu soup etc etc.   I ordered the seafood tofu soup. It was delicious and boiling coming out. The side dishes were standard, nothing too special - bean sprouts, kimchi, cucumbers etc. I took one star off for the amount of seafood in there. 1 shrimp, 1 mussel, and a few pieces of squid. Tofu was silky and plentiful though.   I like the store and the food but it was very average and didn't astound me."}
{"text":"Good food, but I find the place really annoying because they have kpop loudly playing and it is quite small, the prices are high for the quality and amount.  So giving it a 3 stars as I would only get this when I get it to go."}
{"text":"I love this place. I don't know what else to say. Nothing beats a hot stone bowl full of pork bone soup when it's -10C outside and snowing. Their Bi Bim Bap is also tasty.  I believe Pork Bone Soup is what the Owl of Minerva is famous for. It's a staple that you absolutely have you try if you're going to check out this place. It also happens to be one of the cheapest items on the menu.  As of December 2017, they've updated their menu. Now, every item is accompanied by a picture, making it super easy to point at whatever you want to order.  Personally, The Owl of Minerva, be it the Yonge St location or the Major Mack location, is one of my favourite Korean restaurants. They pay attention to the quality of food they serve."}
{"text":"New Owl location that opened up beside captain boil in Scarborough. Was previously V2 Ramen Izakaya which I never bother going.   1. Amazing service, once you walk in you are greeted in korean with hello.  2. Food comes outs piping hot and fresh right to your table.   Free Complimentary side dishes with kimchi bean sprout, and cucumber   Went here with my family to see what the hype is all about with Owl. And was surprised to eat some authentic Korean cuisine.   We ordered beef short ribs which was very flavorful and juicy. Great for meat lovely like myself.   Korean seafood pancake was stuffed with squid bits, scallions, crab meat. Loaded and very tasty  Korean Pork Bone Soup, Just the right amount of spicy, not too spicy and full of pork bones with meat. This is mainly for 2 people and comes with a bowl of rice. Worth coming for this only.   3. Restaurant very clean and bright   Go checkout this place if your in town looking for some authentic Korean food in scarbough after chilling at pacific mall."}
{"text":"Went to the this Owl of Minerva for lunch since I was in the area.   We got the Bulgogi and coke lunch special for about $11+tax. Was good and sizzling when it arrived. We got miso soup, kimchi and snacks prior to it as well.  Generally good, nothing that made me \"wow\", but hungry and yummy for the moment."}
{"text":"The Famous Owl of Minerva, glad to see them in Richmond Hill. Came for lunch on a Sunday. We ordered their pork bone soup - the dish they're best known for, as well as the vegetarian glass noodles, kimchi fried rice, and spicy squid. The food is slightly mediocre compared to what you get at the other Owl locations but it hits the spot if you're looking for Korean food in the area. Service here is seriously lacking though. There are no servers around unless they have to bring a dish to a table. We asked for the bill and a take out box and they came back with the bill and a bag for us but no box and they disappeared in the back again for ages. While usually I'm not too picky when it comes to service, especially at Asian establishments, this place actually left me annoyed. With a half filled restaurant, I don't expect extra attention but just be present. Paying the bill took forever too. Probably won't be back. They other locations are far better."}
{"text":"The Owl of Minerva wasn't what it once was when they first opened in the GTA. This location serves sub-par Korean food though there aren't many options significantly better around First Markham Place. They skimp out on the banchan as well (you only get three dishes, nor do they refill). The prices aren't the cheapest either. I've had their LA Kalbi ($19.99+tax and tip), and the Dwaeji Kalbi ($18.99+tax and tip). Their ribs are not fall-off-the-bone unfortunately, and it takes a bit of work to chew through them, especially the grilled LA Kalbi ribs. The flavours are also bland and could use more seasoning."}
{"text":"2.5 stars.  It was truly a meh moment.  Banchans were aneimic,  lacked taste and felt like an afterthought.   Tried the spicy rice noodles. .. ummm... kinda sweet with pepper flakes and a couple of fish cakes thrown in.   Again appeared to be just an afterthought of,  let's just throw this together without any consideration of seasoning or anything! I then thought how can you go wrong with PBS?  It's their signature dish. .. geez.   Truly a huge letdown.  The bones had no flavor. .. soup was passable but truly how can they survive? ? The 2 food court stalls serve up a better dish and fire much cheaper and better sides.  Thanks but I will go next door to get a bun if desperate."}
{"text":"Got the pork bone soup and it was okay. It came with complimentary kimchi so do not order it in the soup!!! It was bit too salty for my taste but the staff was friendly!"}
{"text":"My group of friends and I were looking for a place to eat near First Markham Place. My boyfriend and I are vegan so normally we tend to avoid Korean chain restaurants because of the lack of vegan options in the ones we've gone to in the past (before going vegan). However, my boyfriend decided it wouldn't hurt to ask an employee at The Owl of Minerva and she assured us that they DID have a few vegan options which is the reason we tried it out, in the first place.   The first thing that felt off was that for some reason, the employees were not very happy that we wanted to wait 10 minutes for our other two friends to arrive before we ordered. We went in around 8:30pm and they said they closed at 11:00pm so I don't understand why they felt the need to rush us to order.  The worst part of the whole experience was that the few vegan options the employee showed us from the menu when we first asked, suddenly could no longer be made vegan for whatever reason. In the beginning, she specifically said that we could substitute any beef with tofu but suddenly everyone was saying that we could not. What a disgusting scheme of luring us in! The only thing that we could order was the tofu vegetable soup which turned out to be small and watery.  Other things that just sealed the deal of us never returning was that the employees never ended up giving our two friends tea or water, nor did they bother offering to refill any cups. They were also extremely pushy about us paying the bill, as if they thought we were just going to simply walk out of there without paying. We were not a rowdy group and we certainly did not look like those type of people.   This whole restaurant and its staff was a complete mess and extremely unaccommodating to dietary restrictions. I have been to several other locations back before I went vegan and never have I had such unprofessional and disappointing service."}
{"text":"Really good food,  but the selection kind of sucks.  They are really understaffed and it is impossible to get a seat here on the weekends.  The food is just ok,  and the price is not cheap."}
{"text":"Good food and quick service makes this a safe choice when craving Korean food. I like the seafood soon tofu with purple rice, and the portions are generous. The restaurant itself is quite bare bones in terms of decor, so it's not the best place to chat over a long dinner, but great for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"The Owl of Minerva just opened up another location up in Richmond Hill in the same plaza as Restoran Malaysia.   I was lucky to have an early dinner around 6 pm on a Sunday as this place really got busy and there was even a short wait for a table. The fact the restaurant is quite small even with the tables all packed closely together it can only seat around 40.   Services fast and efficient... great if you are in a hurry...   I ordered my Seafood Tofu Soup ($8.99) Extra Spicy...but result was like a mild... there were not too many seafood in the broth only a shrimp, a mussel and a oyster... but at least they are all fresh.   3 little plate of banchans was more like an after thought.......   The Owl of Minerva is a great addition to the Bayview Major Mac area... at least people can hop by in case the wait at Restoran Malaysia is unbearable...  FYI, 3 tvs showing CP24 and Pop Korea MTV!"}
{"text":"This is the newest location of The \"Famous\" Owl of Minerva.  Just like other Owl's locations, the menu has authentic Korean dish and entrees. Their Pork Bone Soup ($9.95) was good: a well flavored broth with 4 meaty bones. I opted for the mild version so my dinner mate that could not eat spicy can enjoy that too!   Service here is friendly and fast.  The interior is spacious and clean.  Will definitely be back to try out other items on the menu. Lunch special till 4 pm which has some rice dish that not available during dinner hours."}
{"text":"\"Extra Spicy\"...... Why I always get that look when I request that? And my Extra Spicy always comes out tasting so lame....  The Owl of Minerva is not exception.   On a rainy, cold and windy afternoon, eating a Hot and Spicy Pork Bone Soup ($7.99) seems to be natural...so I decided to have one of those.  As a single diner, I was stuffed at the only single table at the corner... right next to the counter with like folded chairs right beside me... yes I felt cramped.... yes I felt ignored.... but I kind of expected that....  How's my Pork Bone Soup? Thick and garlicky and full of spice. I don't find the pork bone too meaty. I wish I have purple rice to go with it....  Banchan here were not the greatest..... I would have asked them not to bring me any aside from the kimchi.  I ate and I left without even having any eye contact or verbal communication with anyone.... the only time the waitress spoke to me was that they only take Visa or Debit when I tried paying with my Mastercard..........."}
{"text":"This review is for the cold noodle only.  In short, it failed because the flavour was not bold.  The meat was dry and flavourless.  Maybe it is my preference, but Korean potato noodle in a cold garlicky and sour broth is a beautiful lunch with a punch in summer.  And this was not it.  And did I just pay $11 for that?  The environment was nice.  The waiter was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Tender meats, delicious soup, nice serving. This location is definetely mother of all Owl of Minerva's !!"}
{"text":"They used the same successful Owl recipe to open up another location in Richmond Hill. This is the third Owl that I've been to and they're essentially all the same -- fairly small location, Korean music videos, 1-2 very busy waiters, and the same Owl menu.  It's difficult to see this location from the road, or even if you've parked. It's in the same plaza as Restoran Malaysia. It's near the Richmond Hill GO train station as well.  We ordered the dolsot (stone bowl) bi bim bap, the glass noodles, and the beef during a weekday dinner. We only got about half of the regular appetizers :(, probably because the food + appetizers wouldn't all fit on our table for 2. I'm not usually a fan of glass noodles, but the sauce that it was in was very tasty. The bi bim bap was good as well. Overall I thought the prices were high for the food that you get, so I suggest going to any Owl restaurant during lunchtime if you're looking for value."}
{"text":"Came all the way here to get their pork bone soup. 3hours before they close they said they dont have enough to make one order."}
{"text":"Food here is okay, nothing to special or outstanding. The place is a bit cramped during peak hours. The service wasn't too great. The waiters seem like they don't want to be there and are a bit rude."}
{"text":"I used to come here for their Gam Ja Tang but now it's mediocre compared to other restaurants.  They also don't offer appetizers.  They also lack items on their menu."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered take out. I order tofu dumpling soup and my husband got pork bone soup. As my husband was eating the porkbone soup, he discover an insect on top of one of his pork bones. I won't order from this place again."}
{"text":"My friend and I ordered a pork bone soup and fish cake udon. Our orders came out quickly along with the side dishes. The pork bone soup was hardly spicy. Usually my tongue is burning but I was okay this time. There's 2 types of fish cake in the udon. The servers are attentive and asked if we wanted a refill of our side dishes and tea."}
{"text":"I've never had Korean food before, so checking out Owl of Minerva was a new and exciting experience. Before I went, I looked online for recommendations on what to order and then checked out their website. Their website was super helpful and I was able to prepare for going to the restaurant.  I went with a friend who has had Korean several times.  The restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly. There was a K-Pop competition on the TV, and the menu takes up an entire wall, so it's very bright and fun.   They bring you a warm tea when you come in and you can place your order with a server. I ordered the Kalbi/Galbi, which is Korean BBQ'd beef, and my friend ordered beef Bulgogi, which she's had in Korea-town before.  They give you many small side dishes with your meals, which includes bean sprouts and kimchi, and the portions are hearty. I recommend you order the smaller kalbi if you get it - I had to take most of it home, and was happy for it because it was really delicious. My friend thought her Bulgogi was alright, mostly because she had had it made differently before and wasn't used to this kind.  I've since ordered take-out from here for my Husband and I and he loved it too. I highly recommend this restaurant to both people who loved Korean and also who have never had it - it's worth trying."}
{"text":"Anybody who knows me knows I absolutely LOVE dol soht bibimbap and it's almost a given that I order it whenever I go to a Korean restaurant. This time was no exception and I duly ordered my dsbbb as usual. In addition, our table ordered the giant order of gamjatang (that comes w the burner) and a plate of spicy chicken.   The gamjatang was pretty good, as expected. Lots of meat and the rice is SO good w the soup. I think I eat three times the rice I usually eat when it's drenched in the soup.   The reason for the minus minus stars is because of the dol soht bibimbap. It came to the table, half warm. Sometimes places just don't leave it on the burner as long as I would like but that wasn't the issue here. I jabbed my fork into the sunnyside up egg and it had developped a stiff gluey top like it's been sitting out for an hr!!  Seriously, are you serving me an old order? It's waaay too obvious. On retrospect, I should have complained right there but I had already torn it apart and had mixed the bowl up so I didn't. I'm pretty miffed they would even consider serving it and actually did. Left a bad impression.   With all the korean choices I have, this isn't where I'll be going anytime soon."}
