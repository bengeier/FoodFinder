{"text":"This is how food should be. Locally sourced, organic, delicious. Patti has excellent talent and let's the ingredients speak for themselves. My fiancé an I split two veggie plates (they were that good) and I had a perfectly cooked, local pork chop on a delicious bed of puréed squash and shiitake mushrooms.  She had a delicious flounder and grits.  We live in NYC and Harvest Moon stands up next to any farm to table restaurant on that island. The food was definitely worth it an the amazingly friendly staff ensured our return."}
{"text":"I met a friend here for lunch and we both loved the atmosphere. Its cozy and quaint. It was also nicely decorated for the holidays, which created a very warm and welcoming environment. 

To my surprise, they offered both a breakfast and lunch menu. I love the ability to eat breakfast anytime of the day. So I ordered the veggie and cheese omelet. The veggies vary depending on what they have on hand. Today they had broccoli, onions, and spinach. It also came with homefries, which were a combination of sweet potatoes and regular potatoes sprinkled with coarse salt (maybe sea salt?). It was simple and tasty. To complete my meal, I added a side of bacon. The bacon was fantastic. They sprinkled it with ground black pepper. It was very savory. 

Our waiter was excellent. He was friendly and attentive. After we paid the bill, he even offered us a complimentary tea or coffee to-go. How sweet! It definitely helped me stay warm during my walk back to the car. I love little niceties like this. What a great place. The meal and service were delightful."}
{"text":"Great dinner. I've been traveling to Charlotte for some time now.  This place always intrigued me while walking to some other restaurant for dinner. Finally tried it. The pork shank and local salad were fantastic. Simple recipes but the flavor/texture was outstanding. I also had the persimmon cake for desert which was great. The pork tartare app was above average but I'll try something different next time. Atmosphere was nice/quaint, the wait staff was attentive, knowledgable, and stayed out of the way."}
{"text":"Deserves 3.5.  Breakfast was good.  Had a good menu.  Pricey for Charlotte!  Service was iffy.  Liked the place overall."}
{"text":"This restaurant is always delicious.  Today I had the pork burger.  The burger was so thick I had to cut it and eat it, rather than take giant bites.  For dessert, I tried the pots de creme - TRY THIS!  It was sweet and salty and light summer goodness.  The custard was just the right consistency and the caramel oozed over the sides when I took a spoonful.  The salt made it taste like heaven."}
{"text":"Excellent brunch spot! We all liked what we ordered, especially the sweet potato home fries. I like that the menu offers a lot of local/sustainable/farm-to-fork foods."}
{"text":"Great experience. Great wine list. Excellent service. Lovely, cozy space. 

This place knows farm to table and lives it. The real deal.

This is a true favorite restaurant for locals. Always one of 2 places people recommend when I am in town."}
{"text":"I gave my dinner at Harvest Moon a 2 because the restaurant was nice and the staff were good which would have been a 3 or 4, but I had the worst meal I have ever had in Charlotte there the other night which wouldnt even get a 1.  I told the server I wanted something light and he steered me away from my first choice of Farfalle pasta to a broiled vegetable dish.  It sounded good but what arrived was horrible.  Basically a plate (small serving) of mushy vegetables that were tasteless and overcooked.  And full of Mushrooms which I cant eat and werent listed on the menu ingredients.  My review is for this dish only as everyone else in my party enjoyed theirs very much."}
{"text":"Went to Harvest Moon for Sunday Brunch.  I ordered the Ashley Breakfast Burrito.  It was made with scrambled eggs and mashed potatoes together with a spicy salsa and mushrooms.  I found it to be well cooked and the flavor combinations worked well together.  

My only thought was that perhaps it could use one more solid ingredient to enhance the soft texture of the other ingredients.  I haven't exactly been able to determine what yet exactly, black beans, chicken...?  It was served with a side of sliced apples and pears.

My husband ordered the pork burger and given the speed at which he scarfed it down he seemed to like it!  His dish came with a side of salad.  The portions were a decent size and the food was very fresh.

Note though that the place is quite small and lacks noise proofing so it can get loud in there.  We evidently hit the pre-theatre crowd because when we walked by an hour later it was completely dead.  Our waiter seemed a little unsure and new to the role but I guess we all have to start some where.

Given that quality, farm fresh ingredients are high on the list of importance for me in restaurant dining, I would go back to give it another try for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I love love love the farm to fork, local concept. The decor is nice and the service was great. The food...it was ok, my husband had the pork shank which is their specialty, I'm not a huge pork fan, I thought it was a bit tough. Served over grits, they were delicious. I had mahi, it was nicely cook but not seasoned at all, served with very VERY greasy hard potatoes cubes, they were inedible, and  \"apple chips\" which were three paper thin strips about 1/2 inch wide and 1 inch long. They serve biscuits which would have been incredible but they were wayyyy too salty. I want to try breakfast there. I hope they can step up the food and succeed!"}
{"text":"Well food was fresh and delicious service was way behind the power curve though one of my pet peeves is an empty glass but we had four empty glasses and there were less than a dozen people in the restaurant. O well to many places to go with fresh delicious food and great service than this joint."}
{"text":"Need more vegetarian/vegan options, really missing out on the vegan/vegetarian customers who would typically eat at a local farm restaurant.... With that being said, salads are pretty good but that's about all I could have as a strict vegetarian. My boyfriend enjoyed his seafood there but I was disappointed in the lack of selection. 

Don't promote yourself as vegan/vegetarian friendly if the only options are salads."}
{"text":"I gave Harvest Moon Grille another try recently and had a better experience. I ordered off the appetizer menu, rather than getting a full entree. I tried the \"PORKetarian\" soup option, a hot and sour style soup and a collard salad. The soup was more like a stew: loaded with tender pork, a few veggies milling around and a nice broth that wasn't particularly hot or sour but was good nonetheless.

The collard salad comprised raw collard greens cut into thin ribbons with a hard-boiled egg and a bacon vinaigrette. The dressing was delicious, tangy and a little smoky, the collards fresh and bitter/sweet. The egg was strange: it was pink on the outside - which I assumed meant it had been pickled. But I wasn't able to detect any pickling flavors. So, not sure what that was about. However, the salad was delightful and I finished it off.

And then the dessert: I ordered a salted caramel pot de creme and what I received was a little pot of heaven. The caramel was rich and not overly salty. It lay in a thick layer over a creamy custard. It was amazing. I didn't allow myself to finish the entire serving, but only because I didn't want to have to endure 4 hours of working out to compensate.

I still have to say I don't love Harvest Moon, but I do really respect its mission to serve only local, seasonal fare. And I was perfectly satisfied with my meal on my most recent trip."}
{"text":"We ate really well when we were in Charlotte and this place was no exception. Since it was connected to our hotel, we had lunch and dinner here and I was really impressed with both meals. For lunch I had the \"Banh Moon,\" clearly a play on a banh mi, which was really good, which was served with my current obsession - sweet potato fries. 

For breakfast, trying to be healthy, I had oatmeal. Now, I've never raved about oatmeal in restaurants. I usually regret the choice because its boring and everyone else's food is better. This oatmeal was really good (though they gave me enough to feed 5 people). It was served with apples that had been sauteed in a light butter sauce, which added a really unique punch to the oatmeal. I'm pretty sure that I only ate a fourth of what was served, but it was very filling - super useful because the deposition went through lunch and I didn't get to eat again until we got to the airport at about 7pm. 

All in all, I was really impressed with the menu and the quality of the meals."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! I had the bacon and cheddar pancakes and they were perfectly done with scrambled eggs on top. Our waiter was really efficient and nice and even made sure we had fresh brewed coffee (rather than bottom of the pot) perfect brunch place! A little small so not exactly for large parties."}
{"text":"Limited choices because I was getting breakfast for free during my stay, but the harvest moon pancakes are OUT OF THE WORLD!! Great service and tea selection too! I came down again this morning and the waiter saw me and said \"hot green team ma'am?\". It's a small gesture, but it made me feel good."}
{"text":"Wow. That was the best meal I have had (so far!) in Charlotte. The service was amazingly friendly, including conversations about the local produce, internet technology and Widespread Panic (the band).

I had the tasty butternut squash soup, then moved on the the braised rabbit (always a treat!) in a tangy ragu with sliced polenta and pungent mushrooms. A side of potatoes was hot and salty!  For dessert I took the recommendation to go with the sweet potato bread pudding and I was NOT disappointed. It was everything I hoped for... with a nice touch of a FRESH french press of DECAF coffee.... that was also perfect.

I will be back for breakfast and a deeper exploration of the menu at this great restaurant!

{"text":"The food here was actually really great - sweet potato burger is very different, fries were good and the pulled pork looked amazing.  The prices are slightly steep for sandwiches and breakfast stuff, but of course that's what you should be prepared to deal with if you choose to eat at a farm to table restaurant in the middle of the city.  

What really gets 5 stars is the service.  I called to inquire about handicap accessibility and the people I spoke to were beyond accommodating.  They set aside a convenient table for us and it WAS ready and waiting when we arrived.  However, the two people in our group who actually needed the accessibility did not see fit to join us until the rest of the party had ordered, eaten, and were ready for the bill.  Despite such inconsiderate restaurant behavior, our server was kind, patient, nothing but friendly and flexible through this entire process.  When our very late arrivals came in and sat down, nobody seemed the least bit annoyed with us (which they had every right to be as our group was now sitting on a larger table twice as long as we should have been!)  The late guests were promptly served, no fuss.  

Thank you to the staff here, great job! If you were annoyed, I understand and you were awesome at not showing it!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is small however the great food makes up for the tight accomodations. I had the Bratwurst Burger with collard greens and it was excellent. The portions are adequate for a brunch and the price was fair."}
{"text":"I love this spot, I go here often on my own for brunch. It's quite, close by to me, fast and the staff is always nice! I gave this place 4 stars only because since I do come here often and would like to see more variation on the menu, mix it up a little bit every once in a while. I have to say their eggs benedict is amazing and their coffee is delish! If you plan to come here from brunch come early as it does get busy, but waiting is worth it. I really do love this spot and will come back time and time again! :)"}
{"text":"I love their lunch menu but wouldn't rave about dinner. Burgers are delicious. Fresh and tasty ingredients. Good service.
Hate the annoying white papery napkins which leave lint on your trousers though.

Good stuff, come here regularly."}
{"text":"Nice place great service. I had an omelette it was okay. I guess the big dreal with this place is that it is farm fresh organic eat local. Wasn't knock me out my socks nor  was ot the worst thing I ever had."}
{"text":"Now reopened in Lincolnton, NC"}
{"text":"Had a salad and drink for lunch and the tab put me right at $15 bucks. Service was sub-par, food mediocre."}
{"text":"The best bacon and grits I have ever had. The bacon was from a pig owned by the chef . The grits were amazingly delicious and really light.I was visiting and now have to prepare myself for being disappointed in any grits and bacon i eat for a long long time."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Clean& quaint

Food: French Toast was pretty tasty. Buckwheat Pancakes did not seem nutty grain like I am accustomed. Oh well, they were ok. Fresh butter& maple syrup made them better. Really like use of farm to table. 

Service: Hostess was on point with seating people quickly. Our server was inattentive and did not know the menu well. We had to get her attention several times. We did not feel too bad because her other tables did the same. She just was not as sunny as her co-workers.

Prices:  Pretty moderate for what you get. We will not be in a rush to return nor turn down if we are hungry& in the area...middle of the road experience."}
{"text":"The Apple Soup is DELICIOUS!

I went for lunch yesterday and was completely underwhelmed by everything but this soup. I have no idea how often they have it (it happened to be the soup du jour), but seriously people, if it's on the menu, GET IT! You will not be disappointed...it's almost like a cross between apple cider and apple sauce, very smooth, and it still has a sweetness to it, but with a little kick that you wouldn't expect.

I know it sounds strange, but you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Sometimes hotel restaurants are at best mediocre. Harvest Moon Grille at the Dunhill is off to a great start.  Located in the historic Dunhill Hotel uptown. From what I can tell, it's a simple menu, focusing on local and seasonal produce and meats.  My eggs benedict, with a southern twist of toast and sausage were delicious, served with potato and sweet potato hashbrowns .  It's a little bit on the hotel expensive side, but easy to pay for when you know it's good products and made with care.  Can't wait to try dinner! Two pluses, were good service and decent coffee."}
{"text":"Reading the previous reviews, I'm at a loss. Either there were some kinks with the opening, or people have some really bizarre expectations. The restaurant is \"vanilla?\" I don't know about anyone else, but when I go to a place that bills itself as a bistro or grille, I'm not looking to be wowed by their decor. But that said, what was wrong here? Nothing that I could see. The large photographs of the farm were beautiful and created a homey environment that was well in keeping with the \"local real food\" concept of the place.

But that's just it. This restaurant is more than just a place to eat out. It's a place to go to support a CONCEPT, and the sad thing is, it's a concept that shouldn't NEED so much \"support\" from us diners, it's one that ought to go without saying, that ought to BE the standard not be fighting against the standard. Right now in America, most dining-out experiences are an adventure in self-poisoning. You're served meat and veg-of-unknown origin, harvested or butchered who-knows-how-long-ago, possibly even frozen for months before it was prepared for you, in portions so large you really OUGHT not eat them even if they taste good enough to try (which is rare).

Not at Harvest Moon Grille. Your vegetables were in the ground no more than a day or two before you are eating them. Your meat wasn't frozen in pre-fab cuts, and you can bet your sweet sausage it wasn't raised in a 10x10 foot pen and force-fed hormones that you'll be lucky enough to consume TOO when you eat it. And you can TASTE the difference. 

My meal here was nothing short of perfection. Was it \"simple?\" Yes, I suppose so, in that \"there was no 'bathed in a reduction of exotic, delicately infused with ingredient-I-never-heard-of, and scented with spice-I-can't-pronounce\" kind of way. In other words, it was \"simple\" as in \"unpretentious,\" as in \"your self-image as a person who can splurge on expensive fancy food will not be enhanced by dining here and dropping the name.\" I don't know about anyone else, but that alone gets them the extra star from four to five in my book! I am SICK of restaurants claiming to be \"fine dining\" that are really nothing more than \"pretentious\" or \"expensive\" dining, with food that--packaged differently--would cost a whole lot less and tastes like it.

Harvest Moon serves food that just tastes GOOD, no, tastes BETTER than other restaurants, *just as it is.* Case in point? My husband ordered the Pork Chop which was not only cooked to perfection, it came with a plate of sauteed vegetables (that was large enough for the two of us to share, thank goodness b/c I pilfered about half of it from him it was THAT good) that tasted so sublime, I had to ask the server what type of oil was used. I was SURE it was something exotic it was just so flavorful. To my surprise (and pleasure) it was just plain old EVOO! That and salt and pepper. Done. So why did it taste like heaven? Because the VEGETABLES were so fresh and sweet and colorful!  That's it. 

Same for the Carrot soup I ate (which, by the way, was the best soup I've had anywhere of any flavor). Every part of it was fresh and homemade, the chicken stock, the carrots, everything, and the result was so good I seriously contemplated licking the plate. As it was not THAT casual a place, I opted instead for another one of their HOMEMADE rolls, and the plate appeared as to have never contained food when I was done with it. I had to practically stab my husband in the hand to keep him from stealing too many tastes, and that's from a guy who said minutes before ordering \"Meh, I don't really like carrot soup.\"

It was drizzled with just the smallest touch of molasses, and that was that. But wow, blew my mind.

But even that was nothing compared with the Brisket \"starter\" I had (which incidentally was large enough for a smallish meal, so I just had that and the soup and some of hubby's veggies and I was full, perhaps because the flavors are so full and rich, you don't need \"more\" just to be satisfied (now THERE's a concept we should ALL get behind!). It was rich and tender and served with a delicious horseradish sauce and some simple yams, but really, what else do you need when the meat is so fresh and cooked so well? Nothing but a good glass of red wine, which they ALSO had, and thankfully for me--the wine ignoramus--a knowledgeable and passionate server to recommend it!

Desserts were great too, but I'm running out of space to talk about them so I'll just focus on coffee--French Press is standard. Need I say more? 

Bottom line? If you just love good FOOD, the real deal, natural, homemade, flavorful, where the chef is facilitator and not \"artiste\" with an attitude, EAT HERE. And when you do, you won't just be eating a great meal, you'll be taking a concept that needs support, the concept that real, whole, LOCAL food shouldn't be so darn hard to find!"}
{"text":"Came to the Harvest Moon Grille at the recommendation of a nearby hotel's manager.  I was in town on a business trip and my coworker and I were looking for a delicious meal after our day of 'business.'  A glass a wine.  Some meat and cheese.  Good stuff on the menu.  Two daily soups, vegetarian and porkatarian! Ended up with the goat & pork meatloaf.  How often are we going to get that chance again?  Not very often in my neck of the woods.  It was a lovely dinner and I look forward to returning on business so I can try some more menu items and maybe be able to confirm that fifth star!  Oh, and when you're done, go to the bar and Pete will make you a fantastic drink!  You never know who your going to meet at a hotel bar.  There were some pretty interesting characters when we were there!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for breakfast and finally went this AM. Was pleased with the coffee and OJ (squeezed fresh) and ordered the Fried Green Tomato BLT made on some lovely wheat griddled bread. It was good but the side of potato salad made with garlicky mayo was the best part. The hubs got a falafel burger which he scarfed quickly due to a late night at Chima's! 

A cozy place for a casual breakfast."}
{"text":"Wow! This place was great. The boyfriend and I were walking around charlotte looking for a place for lunch and this place did not dissapoint! I got a pimemto cheese bacon and tomato sandwich that was delicious. It came out on this subtly sweet multigrain bread. Supposedly they make all their own bread there. (it shows) my boyfriend got a pulled pork sandwich that was great too. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I as thoroughly disappointed by the Harvest Moon Grille.  My food was bland at best.  I went expecting to have flavorful, fresh food, and wound up with a poorly prepared meal.  Overall, it's a place I feel is best to be skipped.  I only wish it were forgettable, but it's truly one of the worst meals I've had in the last couple of years."}
{"text":"The Harvest Moon Grill is exactly what it professes to be-creative locally sourced food cooked to highlight the quality of the ingredients. If you are looking for the over-salted, hugely portioned, cookie-cutter type food that we've become accustomed to receiving at restaurants in the United States, this is not the place for you. We've been to the HMG many times and the food is consistently delicious. There are a variety of options to suit all diners. The executive chef is one of the owners of a local farm, so pork offerings come from there. They can be counted on to be delicious (pork belly, pork shank, and charcuterie are standouts). However, the vegetarian should not hesitate to go to HMG! There are plenty of equally delicious vegetarian options available. Don't miss the Harvest Moon Grille!"}
{"text":"Harvest Moone Grille is the best kept secret in Charlotte right now! The entire menu is fresh and local, the staff is extremely knowledgeable about the menu and wine list, and the atmosphere is inviting and intimate. 

We went last night and had phenomenal food which was all perfectly paired with wines by the maitre'd who told us all about the concept and what we were being served. 

I will definitely be recommending Harvest Moone Grille to all of my friends and we be returning very soon!"}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed with the breakfast here, the Ashley's Breakfast Burrito(with egg whites) probably would have been pretty good if it were not so watery.  I did enjoy the side of apples and sampled the sweet potato hash which was very good.  For an $11 breakfast, I guess I was expecting more.  Let's see what happens on my next trip......."}
{"text":"I probably wouldn't have ever gone in this place if my fiance hadn't wanted to try it. I've been to a few \"farm-to-table\" restaurants and left unimpressed, if not downright disappointed. However, I checked out the menu before we went in, and I was intrigued. It took us a while to decide on food because there were several items I thought sounded delicious. I got the fish tacos and she got the beef burger. Both were very good (although I'd recommend the tacos over the burger). I was extremely satisfied with my meal. This place also has the best biscuits and gravy. We will be going back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Meh...in charlotte for a few days and im still looking for good food. Ordered eggs Benedict and eggs were overcooked and would've guessed it had no ham if it were any smaller. The French toast was subtle and made with thin pieces of bread instead of thicker pieces of French bread. The cappuccino was made with what tasted like dripped coffee instead of espresso. The service lacked personality/smile. All in all I wouldn't go back unless it was free cause for the money you dont get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"Just happened upon this place by word of mouth. What an amazing find! The biscuits are sweet, cooked to perfection and good with anything. The grits are creamy and well seasoned, even for someone who doesn't enjoy grits all that often. The staff was accommodating and knowledgeable about the menu. 

The baked apples are the shining star. Pan seared with cinnamon, maple syrup and and brown sugar, it's a sweet treat to enjoy, and highly recommended by our server. Small place with limited seating, but quaint and home-like feel. (Especially if you get lucky enough to hear someone play the piano outside in the lobby). We will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"I went to a Yelp event at Harvest Moon's banquet facility last night. I loved the location, the service was excellent and the food was amazing! I love the fact that the food comes from no further than 100 miles away & really enjoyed the location -Dunhill Hotel. The biscuits (which apparently come with every meal) were delectable and I loved the smoked trout! We will definitely be returning soon. 

Also, the Yelp team did a great job with the event last night!"}
{"text":"Standing outside of Harvest Moon ogling their menu, we were greeted by the manager (?) who suggested that we might as well come in because there was nothing better in town.  I don't know what else was close, but it was definitely delicious!  

We were asked to make ourselves at home in the lobby of the hotel (nice place, by the way) while they prepared our table for two.   We were made to feel very at home and breakfast was INCREDIBLE.   Eggs benedict for me that was really delicous.  I can't remember what he had, but maybe I'll edit when I do.  That's what I get for waiting this long to write a review.

I highly recommend the Harvest Moon Grille!"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place since I saw the reviews in the paper and was excited to try it for brunch. I am sad to say the best part was sitting outside on a beautiful afternoon watching the tourists enjoy Charlotte. I ordered the eggs, bacon, potatoes and toast and although the bacon had a nice flavor, it was limp and very greasy. I liked that the potatoes were sweet, but they were tiny and hard to eat with a fork.. The eggs I ordered were supposed to be softly poached but they were hard. All in all, it was a fairly good meal but my expectations were higher for this place. I'm sorry to say I'm not sure if I will return."}
{"text":"I'm a total fan! Their mission is to provide fresh, local, sustainable experience to their patrons as well as support local farmers. 

The food was delicious! From the beet soup to the fresh apple salad, the beginning of our dining experience set the stage for the main courses. The main course was fabulous! I ordered the Slow-braized Grateful Growers Pork Shank with grits covered with a moonshine-apple glaze. OMG. Depending on the season, they will have different entrees because they like to get their food within a 100 mile radius and create dishes based on what they can purchase...so kiwis probably won't make the cut. 

The drinks were refreshing! I had the blackberry mojito....tart and tangy.

The location is great and they did a great job adding warmth and modernity to the interior. I love the glass at the front to do some people watching."}
{"text":"I am so sorry to have to give this just three stars. I'd have given it four, but the waitstaff was so busy that we were pretty ignored. After we got our entrees, I would have loved another glass of wine, but our waiter never asked if we needed anything. After our plates were cleared, we waited another 15 or 20 minutes without our waiter ever checking on us. We wanted dessert, we wanted coffees, but since no one ever asked, one of us eventually just got up to ask someone for our check. 

Our waiter was taking care of a big table upstairs as well as a lot downstairs, so he was pretty overwhelmed. My advice is if you want to go to Harvest Moon (which by all means, please support a farm to table restaurant in downtown Charlotte), go during the week. The food was wonderful, but our first time was disappointing due to the service issues. 

Now about the food: It's great. It's fresh, the portions are perfect, and there are vegetarian and vegan options, which makes me happy, even though the clear specialty is pork.

Anyway, this restaurant really should get 4 or 5 stars but the organizational issues really pulled it down."}
{"text":"Really great food, fantastic service with a great ambiance! I love the \"farm-to-table\" concept as this makes the food that much better as it is so inherently fresh. Now if you're a \"huge portion\" person, this isn't the place for you. However, the portions are big enough to satisfy most. Yet it is the food itself that is the star, and if you are a \"high quality\" person, then this IS the place for you! And Brian the Wine Steward has selected a small but high quality wine list that has something for everyone. He recommended an Owen Roe wine from Washington State that was the PERFECT accompaniment with our food. To top it off, the Chef/Owner Cassie made a personal appearance at out table to thank us for coming in. What a GREAT experience!"}
{"text":"I wish I could put more stars as I truly appreciate the attention and support for local protein, dairy and vegetable & fruits.  However, other than the wonderful host and one of the chefs I got to meet, I've been disappointed with the service both times I have eaten at Harvest Moon Grill.  Once was for dinner a few weeks back.  The food was wonderful, but requested items for continuously forgotten.  It appeared to be a lack of help as they obviously had not anticipated anything on a Tuesday night uptown.  

However, the food WAS quite tasty (I had the sweet potato cakes), that I chose to go back for a birthday lunch to try one of the other entrees.  To my grave disappointment, the lunch menu was basically nothing but burgers.  Besides that there was a hummus wrap (which I would either make at home or pick up at a deli), fish tacos, a Cobb salad and a sweet potato burger.  Since the fish that came in wasn't good and so no tacos, I went with the sweet potato burger which was simply a bigger sweet potato cake on a bun.  Again, the order was made wrong and the staff forgot, neglected or go wrong items for our table.  Everyone was nice, but it does get frustrating when they is constantly something.  Once again, it seemed they were not prepared for the number in for lunch.  At this point, I'd go back if someone else wanted to go but probably not because I suggested.  I hate to say that and maybe its just a learning curve.  Unfortunately, people can take their money elsewhere-quick."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Charlotte. Not only the food is yummy, but the menu is also very interesting and unique. Strongly recommended."}
{"text":"The food is always good. And I'm not talking about the breakfast or BLT sandwiches or other lower-priced items. The ambitious dishes are executed very well.

But, even though other reviewers have rated the service as \"great\" or \"excellent\" I can't say that for any of the times I have been to dinner at this restaurant. The restaurant does not handle reservations well - too long a wait to be seated. Once seated, too long a wait to have any sort of bread, butter, water put in front of us. The food service is amateurish; and there were times when the floor was obviously short of staff. My experience with poor service is the reason I do not patronize this restaurant as much as I might. I once asked a waiter about how a dish was prepared - her response was \"I don't think so\" and she kept looking at me. I then had to ask her if she worked for tips, and if so, to go to the kitchen and come back with a definitive answer, please.

If you are not in a hurry, are not bothered by entrees not coming out at the same time, don't mind if the waiters act as if they would rather be somewhere else, by all means go, but go early or late - don't get caught in the dinner rush."}
{"text":"This is fantastic locavore dining in downtown Charlotte.  Amazing food and charming service all 3 times I have been there.

I love going for brunch.  I pick up GF focaccia to bring home every time I visit.  And they have the best grits in the history of the world.  You do not need to add anything, not even butter."}
{"text":"I was in town on business and wanted something other than the multiple steakhouse chains downtown. Great dinner. Very knowledgeable Sommelier and an interesting wine list of reasonably priced treasures. Eclectic menu. Homemade cheese and sausage appetizer. Clever entrees that didn't try too hard. I can tell that the menu changes all the time so there's no point in saying what I had. It was all very good. Stop hunting and eat here."}
{"text":"I met a friend for lunch here the Thursday before New Year's Eve.  The streets were all blocked off and so I had to park in the garage, so that annoyed me since it was $8 for less than an hour.  I went to walk in the front door but there was a sign requesting patrons to go through the hotel because of the cold air.  Apparently I am the only one who can read because everybody else just walked right in that door!

The decor stinks, it just felt awkward and sparse in there, especially after walking through the nicely decorated public areas of the Dunhill.  I had the steak sandwich and it was good, as was the side salad.  The roll they gave us to start though was pretty bleh for me.  Our server started off okay and then at the end she just kept ignoring us.  We were the last 2 people in there and I kept trying to make eye contact with her, but to no avail.  Even after she had to see someone else clean our table off she still didn't come by to see how we were or if we needed our check, which we did!

Overall, not in a hurry to get back but I wouldn't write it off completely."}
{"text":"Great veg and vegan options; would have liked it more spicy though. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Awesome meal!  Most of the meals that I read about are locally sourced - GREAT JOB!

We are outside and the day was perfect - great people watching.

The Pimento Cheese sandwich was a great appetizer, split of course.

The meatloaf sandwich was divine and the Guilford County Catfish sandwich blew my mind - KABOOM!

RUN HERE AND EAT - NOW!  The service was great and the owner came around to say hello several times.

Not inexpensive, but well worth it to support local businesses and growing operations."}
{"text":"\"Local Foods\" From nearby in NC and SC - I'm not a fan yet!  Everything was good as in three yelp stars.  The service was better than good, the soup had Great Pork from Greateful Growers and was good the Clams were OK, though not a yelp A- OK!  I will return at some point because the Pork Burger was huge and looked great!  The Guy eating it said it was!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent--inventive, flavorful, and just damn good! We'll definitely be back next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"Everything is 100% fresh and organic. This is an amazing venue and it is open everyday!"}
{"text":"First off, the staff where very friendly and welcoming. I felt like they cared I was there.  Quick to get extra requests and on top of what needed to be done to have an enjoyable eating experience. The food was great too. We had Local Omelets-one egg white and one with the yolks included, both were good. Thought they could of used a little more flavor and cooked less, but the mushrooms saved the day. Had french toast too. It was nice and subtle. The wonderful syrup brought out the flavors in the toast. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Our meal here just kept getting worse and worse. 

They seem to be in a transition period as they convert the restaurant from Monticello to Harvest Moon Grille. We had a really tough time even finding the restaurant since there was no sign on the building. Also, their menu didn't even have a restaurant name on it. Bizarre. They really should have just shut down the place until they can fully open up the new spot!

Nonetheless a big chalk board indicated they are now Harvest Moon Grille. Their brunch menu was kind of odd, and I had a hard time finding something really good to try. 

My boyfriend ordered the eggs benedict, and then at the recommendation of our server I ordered the \"Eye Opener\" which was something to the effect of a fried egg covered in hollandaise, sausage, all on a biscuit I believe. Came with choice of potatoes or grits. I chose grits.

After we ordered, we waited. And waited. And waited. I realized it was going to be a LONG wait so I ordered some coffee to sip on. We probably waited for 20-30 minutes even though there were very few tables in the restaurant. I was a little peeved at all the servers/staff just standing around doing nothing. 

When the food finally came out, I first notice that I was given potatoes instead of grits. So I asked for the grits, which probably took another 5-10 minute to retrieve. Also the potatoes were sweet potatoes, which was not indicated on the menu. I personally like sweet potatoes and the concept of having them as a breakfast item; it was just odd this was not said on the menu.

We also noticed that my dish didn't really look like what I had envisioned in my head. First of all, it was presented like a burger, which is another item on their brunch menu. I asked the server if she was sure I got the right thing, and she said yes. I couldn't see, or taste for that matter, the hollandaise that was supposed to be there. There was no biscuit, instead, a soft bread. And my egg was not fried, it was scrambled. So if that dish was indeed the Eye Ppener, they really need to fix their menu because that is not at all what I thought I was getting. We asked for additional hollandaise that never came.

Finally, once the meal was over and we were paying our check, one of the staff members came over to fill our water glasses. Immediately my boyfriend noticed that there was all sorts of stuff floating in our water. We pointed this out to the server that had just poured us water and she seemed confused and sort of laughed it off. We were not given new waters- or even an apology. 

I would definitely not return to this spot. Not sure what their deal is as they transition to their new concept, but they have quite a few kinks to work out."}
{"text":"The food was very good! We had the bacon cheddar pancakes and the veggie omelette with sweet potato wedges. Service was above average. The only thing that didn't make our experience a 5 is that we were seated in the overflow dining area in the hotel. It was very quiet and we could hear everyone's conversation. A little music and this problem would be solved!"}
{"text":"I read all these great / mediocre reviews and I cannot fathom how different the food must be. This review is based on two separate visits to Harvest Moon Grille, both times for lunch.

The first time, I ordered the Banh Moon, and the \"hoagie\" came with meat that was 75% raw fat. I guess whoever carving it didn't understand how to cut meat and decided to cut me an entire piece of fat. The waiter didn't check if the meal was ok, until they decided to take our plates. He was nice enough to comp my dish, but I left hungry and a waste of time.

A group of us went there to try the place again on 2/24/2012 for lunch. All I can say is I was ashamed to have been fooled twice. I ordered the Bratwurst burger, and apparently this time the line cook, or whoever, didn't understand how to cook meat. Either the burger was frozen and they had trouble or the cook was just terrible. The burger was completely raw in the middle, this is not a beef burger, a bratwurst burger made from pork. This is a health hazard. The rest of my group did not come out better with their food. Someone ordered the sweet potato burger due to Lent, the burger was a mess and flavorless. Another ordered the quesadilla, which had good flavours, but was a soggy mess. Finally, someone ordered a bacon buffalo burger. I don't know what restaurant thinks its appropriate to charge $3 for 1 slice of bacon to be added to a burger, but apparently Harvest Moon Grill does. Oh, all the dishes came with the side dish of mixed beans. Of the four bowls of bean, half were left over, why? Well, half the beans were hard and nobody wanted to risk their teeth. There were beans that were not soaked long enough and nowhere near soft enough to consume.

I honestly feel bad for the waitress at our table, she was pleasant, but whoever was making the food basically ruined our table. We still tried to be nice and leave a reasonable tip for her.

Overall, just absolutely abysmal lunch service (food). I hope the \"good\" reviews have been for dinner or something, but my lunch experiences have effectively made this place an F and a do not dine. Particularly for the seemingly careless preparation of food that could be a health hazard.

I would give it negative stars if I could."}
{"text":"I wish I had a bigger budget for food because I would give this a higher rating if I did. I will say I found the items ridiculously over priced for the amount of food and they could have been more forthcoming with the bread. The over-pricing was no more evident than in the minscule starter salad some of the ladies ordered with the thinnest watermelon slices I've ever seen. I'd be ok with the smaller portions if it was less expensive because I'm ok with trying to shrink portion sizes.

However, while the meatloaf was average at best (my mum makes it better than anyone) the vegetables and garnish were out of this world! Seriously, I cannot express how delicious they were. There were seven people at my table and while everyone's variety of main dishes was just okay, everyone's vegetables was consensus \"best I've ever had.\"

I am a boarderline carnivore but if I get a bigger wallet and return, I will probably get a vegetarian plate of some sort becuase they were just that good. They were that much of a game changer for me.

The main two reasons I gave a three-star review instead of higher was because of the price (too high for what you get in my opinion) and while friendly, the wait staff was not very attentive and even though it was not crowded at all, we had to wait a long time between drink orders and making our food orders, refills on drinks and between clearing the table to get our checks."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a wonderful lunch at Harvest Moon today. The service was wonderful and FAST! I had the Banh Moon sandwhich and it was DELICIOUS! The side today was fresh, in-season veggies and they were also wonderful! If you are looking for a great lunch uptown, this is a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"I ate at Harvest Moon Grille for brunch on Sunday, and I have to say I had higher expectations going in.  To start, the hostess threw me off a little bit with confusing chatter about whether or not she should put us at a table when she knew a reservation was coming in shortly (keep that to yourself - no need to explain how your seating chart works). 

Then on to my food.  I got the veggie omelette which was okay, but not terrific.  It had very little flavor and I had to pour on salt and then ask for ketchup to boot.  I get that the ketchup is homemade, but the consistency upset my stomach a little.  Too watery and had a lumpy texture. 

The toast and jam was delicious, the jam was homemade raspberry, but they sure did not bring out enough to cover the four pieces of toast they brought out.

Glad I tried it, but will not go again."}
{"text":"This is a great brunch spot.  The food is locally sourced and I highly recommend anything with sausage, their biscuits, or grits as part of the meal.  They have crispy yet warm and gooey biscuits and the grits are thick and full of flavor (salt and butter, I presume).  The bacon wouldn't be kicked out of bed for eating crackers, either!!  Good coffee and don't be afraid to try the bacon and cheddar pancakes...somehow that combo works well.

This restaurant is attached to The Dunhill so it does have a little bit of a hotel-restaurant atmosphere to it...not a great \"impress-my-date\" environment.  But, super yummy breakfasts (served until 2PM)."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place and I got the opportunity at Taste of Charlotte.  Can't say much about anything else, but the Moonitas (carnitas soft taco) was super delicious.  It tasted like California food, in the good way, where everything is super-fresh and local.  My friend's pulled pork sliders must have been good too because they disappeared real quick.  Will be heading in to give the restaurant itself a try."}
{"text":"Like so many others before me, I had high hopes for this place given it's commendable food truck heritage, but I regret to report that (as of last week) things have not changed and there still is nothing that shines about breakfast here.  It goes to show that even a farm to fork concept, while laudable, still needs a bit of inspiration and creativity to rise above the pack.

On the whole I was taken aback by how \"vanilla\" the whole breakfast menu appeared.  Everything was traditional and pretty much egg-based.  You are going to get sausage or bacon with just about anything.  Not veggie-friendly, which is sad since gardens are beginning to burst at the seams for the summer crop.  Vegans need shop elsewhere.

Service was also awkward with different folks taking orders, bringing out drinks, and then serving platters.  There was little coordination, though, as we were asked for drink orders several times.  I can't say anyone seemed overly friendly, but this may be due to the rush of people trying to eat and check out of the attached hotel within the prescribed timeframe.

Sadly the food was just as uninspiring as the menu.  Sweet potato hash (the mandatory side to every platter) was perfectly cubed bits of sweet potato either lightly fried or pan sauteed plain.  That's right, plain as could be.  Never mind the mountains of fresh herbs springing out of the ground right now.  No rosemary or thyme, no flavored oil, no sea salt, nope.. just plain.  I also had to send back my egg order as over-medium apparently meant cooked thru to the kitchen on this visit.  They got it right the second time.  

I guess this is just a lost opportunity right now.  With the growing movement for locally-sourced food, and plenty of providers to offer interesting options (micro-greens to add some color to the plates maybe???) there is so much more Harvest Moon could do here.  Until then, there is little here to differentiate between Harvest Moon and any of the diners or other breakfast stops in town."}
{"text":"Solid 3 star restaurant and deserves a 3 1/2 star if that was possible.  Farm to table with a new South menu (twist on classic Southern dishes).

Sampled several appetizers (small plates).  Decent stuff but one of the plates had a gray smear that I think they said was pheasant or quail pate.  It smelled like crap and tasted god awful.  The head cheese on the same plate was actually great but the pate smelled and tasted like ass.

Decent wine, beer and drink selection.

Service was great.  Got to gives these guys props on their service.

My entree was the pork chop.  It was decent.  Others in my party tried the fish and grits and fried chicken.  Everyone enjoyed their meal.  My only minor compliant is the portion sizes are small, or smaller compared to other places.

Last piece of advice, use Yelp or Open Table to make your reservation."}
{"text":"The worst brunch experience I've had in a long time. 
First I asked my waiter about a Sammy and he just looked at me as if I was speaking in tongues. So I asked again with the same response. Okay.. I order a Bloody Mary. He knew what that was, he ordered it, he just never gave it to me. I sat at my table watching it sit for ten minutes on the bar in the lobby. I ordered an egg dish from the menu Craig's something. It looked lovely. It wasn't. My pork belly was raw. White chewy, nasty raw pork belly. I sat there for a good while and not one person came by to touch the table. I asked for my bill. I payed ( I shouldn't have) and hit the road. I've eaten four times from Grateful Growers food truck and have loved it. I won't ever go back to Harvest moon Grille."}
{"text":"After months of wanting to try this place the moment finally arrived.

Since I have eaten food from the Cart/Truck I had expectations, but indoor dining is different here.

The space is small, but they do a good job with getting a lot of seating in the place.  The Decor is sparce and though interesting wall photos of local farms and some of the food you'll eat here, there just isn't enough of it.

With stone floors sound in this place is loud, but it was brunch and to be expected as folks were starting their days.

Living in the city was nice as it is only a short walk from my place and the fall weather was beautiful.

the GF and I looked over the menu but we had checked it out online before coming over.....the GF was disappointed when the item she saw online wasn't on the menu - so 1 star for that one.

She finally decided on the Frittata and I had the Full Moon breakfast.  From the time of order to receiving food was 20 minutes.....though they kept our coffee mugs full it seemed a bit long.

When the food did arrive my consisted of eggs over easy, but the yoke was still clear in many places.....a tad under done which I read had happened here many times before, but was hoping I wouldn't be another victim...unfortunately I was this time.

The Frittata for the GF was overdone and she didn't finish it.

Everything else was good, but for $24 for 2 I can think of a million other places for breakfast in the city.  Though the local - slow food movement may not be in place for many of the other places I'm thinking of, the food at them is more consistent, faster delivery, and cheaper prices making Harvest Moon a once in a \"blue moon\" place for me to eat."}
{"text":"I had been here once in the past and really enjoyed the farm-to-table offerings; this class of restaurant is really missing in my town, Columbia. Unfortunately, on this visit, we had food that was just okay - which would have been fine, if the service wasn't TERRIBLE. 

I suppose we should have known they weren't going to be winning any service awards when the hostess just gestured us towards the back, from the back, instead of coming up to greet us. Server was pleasant but confused, got order wrong, kept having to come back and get more info. Beer was very slow to come out (~15 minutes after order). Food was 1/2 hour after that - and the server brought out two meals, and told my wife that hers would be \"right out\" (5-10 minutes later). The last thing kind of tore it for me. You don't bring out 2 of 3 meals and leave the last person looking at their hands for 5-10 minutes.

I would consider this a one off but my dining companion from Charlotte said she has been having this happen more and more lately. Frustrating experience, would never go back."}
{"text":"I think the food here is much better than Harvest Moon Grill. Same farm to table concept, just more understandable dishes. I ordered the chicken and dumplings which was a fresh take on a traditional dish. Instead of dumplings, they used gnocchi to give a similar texture. The sauce was an au jus sauce instead of a thick, creamy sauce. My fiancé ordered the steak which was really good. Perfectly cooked and the sides of mashed potates/fennel (?) and argula salad complimented the dish nicely. My favorite dish was my french onion soup appetizer. Instead of cheese all over the top, they use a cheese soaked biscuit as the bread. 

Overall, the ambiance is nice - like the addition of the wrap around booth at the front window. Felt warmer and more insulated in the restaurant. Was freezing the last time I sat in that exact space when it was HMG. The only cons I can think of is that the portions are slightly on the smaller side, especially for the price of the dishes. I would definitely go back but this is more of a once a year kind of place for us - not necessarily a regular dinner spot."}
{"text":"What a beautiful concept!  Local clean food, beautiful space, attentive service.  I'm very happy to have Harvest Moon as a Charlotte restaurant option.  We started with the peirogis...cheese and potato goodness just like they should be.  The night squash and potato soup was next...rich, but not too rich with beautiful layers of flavor.  I ended with the pasta toss with vegetables because it was the only vegetarian option that looked like it could stand in for an entree.  The sauce (white wine and butter?) was delicious, but the rest a bit bland.  The vegetables did not seem to compliment each other (mushrooms, broccoli, and cauliflower).  Overall, it was a great meal (and ps, my meat-eating dinnermates were very happy as well!)."}
{"text":"How can you have a cart and be the most delicious thing ever- but have a restaurant that is not as impressive?

We went in April with a group of friends. There was nothing light on the menu. I was eating potatoes and carrots. It was heavy. Nothing felt \"spring\". It felt like a winter menu.

Local food does not have to be bland. This was bland. Safe.  I was expecting delicious flavors to be exploding in my mouth (like Harvest Moon Cart)- but that did not happen.

Also, there are not that many vegetarian options. That really surprised me.

The prices are a bit steep. No side salad. Really guys. Give me a side salad. There wasn't even the option to spend an extra $3 for a side salad. Nope- the only salads were pricey salads that are huge. I enjoy a nice salad with my meals.

I'm a huge fan of appetizers. I love to share. The appetizer menu was very limited and weren't large enough portions to share with a group. In fact, we couldn't even find something that would make sense for a group of ppl to share.

They also have those new bowls that are so popular- the ones that you can't see what the person across from you is eating. Those bowls are hard to eat out of. 

A glass exploded in someones hand while drinking it (wine glass). My friend who has plenty of kitchen experience said that that was from how they are washing the dishes. An amature restaurant mistake- sort of surprising that a place this nice would make it.


The manager was incredible helpful and friendly. The food was just too safe and expensive.  We also went with a very large group of people (something that I try to avoid doing). I think it might have overwhelmed them a bit (they were really slow and we made reservations)

The following day- we went to Lulu's and they had multiple items from Grateful Growers on their menu. With incredible flavors and sauces. If I want grateful growers or local food- there are other options. 

I think if their food was more like the cart- then this would be one of the best restaurants in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I appreciate that it's local & organic but $45 for breakfast for two people was ridiculous when all we had were eggs & bacon w/potatoes & we shared an order of pancakes & only had water!  The eggs didn't taste great & were a bit overcooked.  The sweet potato side that was listed was the same as the home fries so it was just potatoes with a couple of sweet potatoes mixed in & my serving only had one poor little sweet potato :(  The pancakes were just so-so.  The bacon was awesome because they marinate it in maple syrup, apple cider & pepper so it's got a chewy sweetness to it, but I think some people might think it's a little too gooey.  Our hostesses was bubbly & nice, but our server was a bit in the weeds & we had to ask the hostess twice for things we had already asked the server for.  The layout itself is strange.  The main dining area was set up like a lunchroom, with tables crammed in and noisy beyond belief and just not appealing.  We sat in the hotel breakfast \"nook\" which wasn't much better... it was more quiet but the floor had food dropped everywhere.  We weren't impressed and we won't pay that much again for mediocre breakfast food... heck, it had better be an amazing buffet at that price!"}
{"text":"I wondered around looking for a farm to table restaurant in Charlotte.  I found this on a whim and talked with a lovely lady outside.  She told me about the passions of the owner and that she was a pig farmer.  I was intrigued so I grabbed a table by myself and had dinner.  There was a pork house soup that was to die for, amazing flavor with rich spices.  As an \"entrée\", I had the appetizer Farro Salad.  The consistency was good, well cooked though the plate came out ice cold which meant that it was pre made earlier, for an $8 dish it should be all about presentation, change the plate!.  The restaurant was understaffed and it took a long while to get service after my food came out (my waiter was nowhere to be found).  Later on, the waiter and I had a conversation about it and I understand that he had a 12 top table with separate billing though for Seattle Farm to Table pricing in Charlotte, the service should be better.  I love the food, the wine selection was good with getting a fabulous Malbec from Mendoza, Argentina.  They have a great palate and one that I would recommend on a nice long date.  Most everything is local (the Farro is not) and something that I would recommend hearing from your waiter (waitress) about."}
{"text":"Perhaps it was a full moon. Isn't that when odd things happen?

Seeing HMG land on so many \"best of\" lists and after a pleasant brunch here a few months back, I returned for dinner with friends in tow.

We were greeted warmly and seated in the main dining room on what was a slow evening. After ordering drinks, things went a little sideways. 

Our Heritage Trifecta sharing plate arrived not as advertised. In fact, it was kind of a hybrid of Heritage and their charcuterie plate. We shrugged and ate it anyway (as we are easygoing folk), though at $22 I'd call it a small share. One in our group never received the gazpacho she ordered, even after mentioning it when the main course arrived. (It didn't show up on the bill.) And while happy to select from the local/regional beer menu, two in our group kept getting different brews than what they ordered--either due to availability issues or sheer potluck. It was not a busy night, so we were stumped why things were so off-track, and some interactions with our server were just plain awkward.

On the positive side, the pork chop is a beast and very well prepared. The organic vegetables on the side were tender and flavorful. I had the risotto, which was delicious and savory with roasted jalapeno. I would say, though, at $20+, an ice cream scoop's-worth serving was kind of a bummer.

I really admire the fact HMG sources locally and for the most part delivers memorable flavors, but given the price we were expecting a more seamless experience."}
{"text":"I try to eat at local places when I travel, so when I found out Harvest Moon Grille used food from local farmers, I were sold - sustainable and local! The menu items are more \"upscale\" Southern, but the food is authentic and the prices reasonable. This place attracts a fun mix of folks - during breakfast, I overheard conversations for stage blocking, lighting, and songs for an upcoming performance. Great atmosphere, great location."}
{"text":"We ate here New Years' Day.  The wait was about 10 minutes.  Not bad considering we had three adults and three kids under 5.  While we were waiting we saw lots of nice looking food coming out.  Portions seemed large for the breakfast items. 

One adult had the pimento cheese BLT.  It was very good.  Cheese was flavourful the bacon and bread was excellent.  The tomato was deep red and flavourful.  

We also had two grass fed beef hamburgers.  They were cooked nicely, on a very good bun and were served simply with a slice of tomato, mayonnaise, and a specialty cheese (I forget what kind of cheese).  The burgers were served with sweet potato fries which were good, and black eyed peas and collards.  I was disappointed that they did not have any pepper vinegar for the collards.  However, they gave me some of their eastern style BBQ sauce.  It was very very good, and complemented the collards well.

We also got an apple/greens salad.  The vinaigrette was good, the greens were fresh and crispy.  The goat cheese was good, but the apples were cut into matchsticks.  I would have liked bigger chunks of apple, and more salad.  The portion was small, and for $10 I would have expected more.

We liked the place, and would go back.  Service was superb.  The staff was very friendly and welcoming.  The burger was one of the best I have ever had anywhere.  The salad was nothing exceptional.  We would go back for sure."}
{"text":"HMG is a farm to table restaurant, which means the food is grown/raised within 100 miles of Charlotte (except for seafood, which comes from the NC coast) and is always as fresh as you can get. Fresh ingredients means that the menu is constantly changing, allowing patrons to try food prepared by the season and with produce grown here in North Carolina. 
 
My first visit to Harvest Moon Grille was a work dinner hosted by my manager where we got to try a ton of different dishes throughout the evening. Here's a recap:
-Local Cheese & Ham plate: 5/5 stars - the cheeses were phenomenal and the ham was so very good (which makes sense since the owner and chef also owns Grateful Growers farm)
-Pork Belly: 5/5 stars - although quite fatty (it IS pork belly), I decided to give this a try, and it quite literally tasted like dessert it was so sinful
-Chicken Scappolini: 5/5 stars - so delicious with the root veggies and goat cheese fondue
-Sweet Potato Grattin: 5/5 stars - best sweet potato dish I've ever had
-Beignets: 4/5 stars - only because I've had the beignets at Fig Tree and nothing is as good as they are - but these are definitely still worth it
 
As you can see, everything you eat at HMG is phenomenal. You will not be disappointed. Head in at your earliest convenience."}
{"text":"My second time dining at Harvest Moon Grille was on June 24, 2012 for brunch. My mom had friends visiting from out of town and she made a reservation for 5 of us at 11 AM. The first bad sign came as the host greeted us: \"The kitchen is running about 30-45 minutes behind and your table isn't ready yet.\" Our friends were running a bit late themselves so we thought this would be OK. They arrived about quarter after 11 and we waited quite a bit longer before being seated around 11:45. The host also promised \"As soon as you sit down we'll bring you some biscuits and jam.\" That sounded promising. Unfortunately only after 4 requests to 4 different staff members and about an hour later did said biscuits and jam appear. They were delicious - actually the best part of the meal - hot with fresh raspberry jam. I could have eaten 3 by that point but settled for 1.5.

But the late-arriving biscuits could only do so much. For a party with a reservation, the wait time we endured is totally unacceptable anywhere. I was literally about to walk out. Two couples did. One had to be at the airport and they had waited over an hour for breakfast. I was embarrassed for the city of Charlotte as many of the waiting patrons were tourists. To think this might be their lasting impression of our fair city! Very unfortunate. I advised one couple to visit Queen City Q since it was past noon. I seriously considered getting up and going elsewhere again. I felt bad for the Dunhill, an excellent hotel, that its reputation may be scarred from its proximity to the restaurant. The front of the house staff could not have been nicer although our waiter seemed overworked and was probably avoiding us because he could not bring us anything to eat.

We finally got our food just after 1 PM - yes, two hours after our reservation time. The catfish and eggs with grits is a unique and very tasty dish. Everything else was nothing special, similar to the previous brunch I had here. So disappointing. The concept of farm to table cuisine is admirable but based on my experience, this place does not yield satisfactory results. Harvest Moon Grille seriously needs to take a look at its business operations and be sure they have backup. And about those biscuits: they should come out gratis to every table as soon as folks are seated, even if the kitchen is running on schedule.

Another negative note: parking is supposed to be free in the Dunhill deck when you eat at Harvest Moon. When we exited, it showed a balance of $2. Although this is not a big deal in theory, considering the strife we went through just to eat, this was the last straw. We went inside and someone had the audacity to tell us that it was $2 \"because we were there too long\". No kidding. They finally gave us the $2 in cash to use at the machine after a lot of argument. I'm not sure if this was the hotel or the restaurant but either way, the restaurant needs to figure out how to handle this issue as well. Good thing there are more and more places to eat downtown. Some advice: find another one."}
{"text":"They make some mighty fine bacon at this place. Supposedly the head chef also operates a farm that raises their own hogs so it's no wonder their pork products are really top notch.

I thought the home fries which included sweet potatoes in addition to the norm was also noticeably tasty."}
{"text":"yikes - I guess it is true that this place is a hit or a miss.

Served a raw goat burger - and then I was served a way over cooked goat burger. It came as a recommendation of the server but it was terrible even flavor-wise.

Awful service- and I paid $24 for a meal  I threw out when I got home.

I doubt I would go back ..."}
{"text":"Did not expect this!! Fresh, local fare that is four star quality.  BTW, please keep it under your hat, I don't want it to get so popular that I can't get in!"}
{"text":"let me start by saying i will be back but i was not blown away by my first $150 visit to harvest moon grille, date night.  my rating is low on them bc of 3 things: #1, clam app was terrible, great clams, terrible broth and burned black toast points, #2 the lack of music, there were a few tables in there when we sat down, by the time we left there was one other group in there and without low music we could basically hear each others conversation, made it a little uncomfortable, and #3 the price, i felt a little shorted after spending $150.  but oh well cry me a river right?!  the food besides the clams was very good but NOT GREAT, i had a shrimp kabob \"catch of the day\" they were served over a bed of farro, corn, and cheese, it was really good but not worth $21.  my lady friend got a summer veg plate and it was good but again, not great.  i had a crepe desert that was good, a nice espresso, she had an irish coffee...we had a reasonably price bottle of white that was good.  there is some other stuff on the menu that i want to try and will be back to do so.  the space is very nice and the staff is GREAT, our waiter Z did a perfect job and Roger the host was extremely nice and knowledgable...i remembered him from zada janes.  id like to give hm grille 3.5 stars but i can so i have to give them 3 but again i'll be back to give it another whirl and next time im going with some of their pork and beef dishes."}
{"text":"After my first good, but not great, meal at Harvest Moon Grille many months back, I've returned for two more rounds - another lunch and a delicious breakfast. Because of these return visits and some kinks worked out in the kitchen, Harvest Moon Grille has certainly earned another star.

In July I enjoyed a quiet and lovely breakfast to myself which included an iced tea and a delectable, uber fresh bowl of yogurt and berries. A first when the kind and efficient waiter set down the bowl, I thought it was a smidge shy on the portion. But oh no...I couldn't even finish it. The vanilla yogurt was perfectly creamy and accented beautifully with their house made granola. Which rocks. Big time. I left happy, full and healthy, indeed.

More recently, I trotted back over for another healthful meal when I ordered the farro salad. I don't think I've ever made farro at home, so I was anxious to try this groovy grain. Again, a small-ish looking bowl of whole farro and seasonal vegetables with lemon-garlic confit dressing arrived at the table. And true to form I finished it but I left happy, full and healthy. The farro wasn't overdressed, peppered or salted and the confit dressing was the perfect light touch. This is the one time in my life I think I would have liked a bit more dressing, actually. 

If you're traipsing around Uptown and looking for a great meal with a fantastic local focus (all items sourced with 100 miles of Charlotte), Harvest Moon Grill is a great choice. They have defined eating local."}
{"text":"We ordered breakfast for takeout since we only live a few blocks away. We really enjoyed the biscuits and gravy and brioche french toast. The home fries looked average but we're actually freaking delicious and the bacon was as well! By the time we made it home the food was still yummy in our tummies!"}
{"text":"This was by far the worse meal we had in Charlotte during our visit.  We came for Sunday breakfast.  There aren't a lot of places open for breakfast at 9:30 so our options were limited.  Although reservations were recommended there were some empty tables inside when we arrived.  We were told there would be about a 30 minute wait and that was just about spot on.

We were seated outside which wasn't terrible considering the street traffic was really light and it wasn't incredibly hot out.  Our servers quickly greeted us and brought out a bottle of water and coffee.  For our meal selection, hubby chose Eggs Benedict with pulled pork and I chose their Harvest Breakfast- 2 eggs, sausage, toast and potatoes.  After waiting for 25 minutes, I had drank all my coffee and our food still hadn't arrived.  Finally, our food arrived via another server and my hubby's plate was WRONG!  He received sausage instead of the pulled pork he requested. I suggested taking it back but we were so hungry that we didn't want to wait.  My coffee was topped off eventually.  We quickly ate, asked for our check and left.  

It felt like we had been forgotten about.  If I remember correctly there were 5 2-top tables outside and the other server came out frequently and even asked if we needed anything and we weren't seated at her table. They were busy inside but that is no excuse to not even visit your tables outside; we are paying guests as well.    It was very disappointing.  I don't know when we will be returning to Charlotte but we won't be returning to Harvest Moon."}
{"text":"My hubby and I recently tried breakfast at Harvest Moon Grill, and sadly, I just cannot recommend this place.  

Issue #1:  Slow Service
Yes, it was busy on a Saturday morning, but it shouldn't take almost a half an hour for the kitchen to prepare breakfast. Not only that, the servers didn't seem to care that most of the patrons were sitting around waiting for their food.  I don't mind leisurely service if the food makes up for it, but that brings me to my second issue...

Issue #2:  Poorly Prepared Food
My hubby ordered the rancheros but instead of the standard over easy, he asked for his eggs over medium.  What did he get?  Over easy!  Grrr.  And I ordered eggs scrambled with cheddar.  Instead of fluffy scrambled eggs with the cheddar mixed in, they were cooked like an omelet, and then cheese was just added on top.  Not very appetizing.  I also ordered bacon with my dish, which came out barely cooked and horribly sweet.  

This was my second visit, too.  On my first visit, I had lunch there with a friend.  We had similar problems, but since it was right after their opening, I chalked it up to new restaurant issues.  I gave them another shot, but after this visit, I think I'll pass the next time.  There are far too many better places for breakfast in CLT!"}
{"text":"I want to be able to 5 star this place SUPERbadly. 

But I can't, at least for brunch. Flavors were solidly safe, portions decent (a marked improvement over the Hill's previously tiny servings) and ingredients of good quality (as my bright orange over-easy egg yolk can attest to). 

The service is confused - brekkie vouchers throw a wrench into the works that the crew has trouble working out. Plus I don't think I've ever received the side I ordered, either at the new place, or the old. I'm forever tweeze-fingering bacon strips off my plate or staring, enviously, at the grits I ordered but never got at the table next to mine.

Space is vastly different from Monticello. Since I really liked the peeling-paint run-down white linen foyer that used to be here, I admit to being a little sad about the change. Still, it's cute, bright, modern.

Hopefully they'll shake the newbie dust off and kill it. I'll wait 'em out a month and give dinner a shot. As long as they're willing to feed a veggie, that is."}
{"text":"This is one of those farm to table restaurants that I read about.

The burger that I ordered off the menu was very good. The food here was well seasoned. A more finicky pallet can or less pallet ,such as mine, can tell that everything presented to you was from the farm and very fresh.

The price was what I expected for a place of this level of quality of food."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here while on vacation for my brother's wedding.  We're not afraid to admit we're Seattle food and wine snobs but we had no idea what a treat we were in for!

Great service, amazing and inventive food (great plays on southern comfort food).  EXCELLENT wine.  I'm not sure if people just don't order French wine in the south, but we found the prices to be amazing.  Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Food: 
1) Baby back ribs with mashed sweet potatoes: OMG! This was FALL OFF the BONE DELICIOUSNESS!! The sauce was flavorful and paired with the mashed sweet potatoes, this dish was a little piece of HEAVEN!! I honeslty don't even like ribs but it's SOOO GOOD!! 
2) Fish tacos with sweet potato fries: Deep fried fish is not really my thing but this was still pretty yummy! The sweet potato fries were really well seasoned! 

Service: 
My friend and I were just standing outside the restaurant and looking at the menu and the hostess was SOO NICE and walked outside to greet us and invite us in! We were immediately drawn in by the welcoming hospitality! The waitress we had was so friendly! I loved everyone that worked here!

Ambiance: 
Large portraits of farming scenary and very modern earthy feel. I really liked how it reminded me Portland or Berkeley...someplace very liberal and hippy-like. 

Price: 
Kinda pricey but well worth the experience and the treat for your taste buds!

Overall: 
I would totally come again! I had a wonderful dining experience and recommend everyone to try it! The menu changes daily to cater towards what's fresh from the local farm so everything is super fresh!!"}
{"text":"I have always loved the beautiful, old Dunhill Hotel and was eager to try Harvest Moon Grille.  We were seated promptly for dinner as there was no wait.
The decor does not have a date night feel.  It is a bit bright.  There are also large farm pictures of the food that I presume is served.  A bit disturbing are the pictures of a lovely chicken and two pigs.  The farmer is shown petting the pigs, but we all know their fate.
I love that they had a vegetarian soup option!  It was broccoli cheddar and so delicious that I could have licked the bowl.  However, on date night, that would have been inappropriate.
My husband ordered the trout, which was served on a spinach pancake.  He remarked that the trout was fresh, and the pancake was flavorful.  I ordered The Ribbons without chicken.  I appreciate the attentiveness of our server to my request, as he repeated my order to insure its correctness.  My pasta was tender, and the broccoli and mushrooms cooked to perfection in a creamy herb sauce.  My dish did need salt and pepper.  Our server, noting my frantic shaking of the pepper, arrived with a pepper grinder.
Even though the ambiance wasn't what we were looking for, the food and service made our night out memorable."}
{"text":"I have dined at Harvest Moon several times.  The food is always pretty good in my opinion - I do love the sweet potato burger that is sometimes on the menu - they definitely need more vegetarian options, being a Farm to Table restaurant.  If you are lucky the service is good but the last 2 times I have been there the service was pretty terrible.  The last time, we walked in the front, and the waiter at the front immediately seated our party of 4 at a table.  About 2-3 minutes later, the hostess came over and said, oh I was saving this table for someone, I'll need to have you guys wait a 3-5 min and then I can seat you.  Ok no problem, although it's weird to make a seated party get up, even if it was the waiter's mistake to seat us there.  The problem was when 3-5 minutes turned into 15, turned into 30.  Also, as we were waiting, the hostess gave us no updates or indication if our turn was coming soon. We also realized she never asked for our name, so now we were wondering if we were even on her list after several other people got called to be seated.  Finally my husband went and asked her what the status was since we were told 3-5 min.  Her response?  I never told you 3-5 minutes, what are you talking about?  Not a good response to give a customer.  Even if 2 people heard wrong, the appropriate response would be something along the lines of an apology and a status.  Needless to say, we left and made the 15 minute hike to Halcyon (another farm to table with organic food restaurant).  It's unfortunate that bad service happened to us twice.  I refrained from leaving a negative review the last time because I like the food a lot and had been there several times with a positive experience.  Like another reviewer said, the service used to be good but is going downhill for some reason.  Also my husband thinks I am being generous with 3 stars :)"}
{"text":"Two stars only for the local, fresh aspect they've got going on.  Unfortunately, here that also translates into bland and uneventful.  I wish we had just gone to McDonald's. And we HATE McDonald's. Anyway...

My husband and I were visiting Charlotte for the weekend, and decided to check out a cute local spot for breakfast on our way out of town. The \"local\" ingredients drew us in, because that usually means they have some interesting, flavorful combinations on the menu.  We sat outside which was nice. 

I ordered the Farmer's Market Frittata, hubs ordered some sort of omelet. Granted, these aren't the craziest things to order, but I could have made them better myself at home.  SO BLAND. My fritatta looked and tasted just like his omelet.  That's laziness, people. Way to slap on different names for the same thing! 

Not only was the food comical, but I literally saw our server ONCE - when she brought my husband's orange juice and stayed to take our order. No personality either, that one. Three different people took care of us, one to refill our waters, one to bring our food, and one to take our plates. NONE OF WHICH was our server.  No one came to check on us during our meal.  We finally asked someone to tell our server we wanted our check. After a so-so meal, and being ignored we were ready to go. Literally 7 minutes later, my husband was ready to walk out without paying.  We ended up walking to the door and waiting there to find our server so we could pay the bill.  Some girl came up and asked if she could help us and who our server was. I said \"I don't know who she is, I haven't seen her the whole meal.\" 

It's not like this is a large restaurant. I could understand if she had many tables and  expressed regret at not being able to take care of us adequately, but she finally showed up and was yakkin it up with the other servers by the service station before she even realized that she MOST LIKELY forgot about us.

Big ups to the busser (?) lady who actually smiled at us and acted like she was happy we were dining at this establishment, and who was doing more work than our server who we were expected to TIP??  No way, Jose. We tip for service, not because it's required.  I've been in F&B for 5 years and am now a manager of a high-volume restaurant in Charleston, and I've only skimped a server twice in my life.  This is the 2nd time.  I wish I had a $20 to give to the busser who was actually working for her money.  

Snooty people and crappy food.  We should have gone to Ri Ra."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends while visiting from out of town. We tried to stop by for a relatively quick bite to eat (we only had 45 minutes) but after 40 minutes.. and we still didn't get a single bite.
 
I have to mention there was a big table of 6-8 older folks (probably guests of the hotel) who seemed kind of loud, unaware and acted like they owned the place. More of their party strolled on in and took up all the attention of the staff while we were waiting around for our orders to be taken. The manager did come by and attempted some friendly small talk but it didn't ease our nerves about needing to head out soon. Once we reached the 45 minute mark, I asked the manager if he knew if our food was going to take any longer and if we can just get it packed up to go.
A few minutes later, the waitress came by and apologized for not realizing we we're in such a big rush (we explicitly mentioned it!!) and said the manager comp'ed our meal (unexpected and nice of him) BUT it still took another 20 minutes. Once I saw her come out of the kitchen with plastic bags, I didn't care. I ran up to her, grabbed the bags without asking if they're mine, smiled, said thank you and sprinted out the door with everyone else.

Overall, the food was pretty good but perplexing because it was piping/burning hot when we ate it in the car which makes us assume the food was JUST prepared in the last few minutes and not in the finishing stages from over a hour ago. I just wish we didn't have to leave looking like horribly impatient people but I think it took them way too long regardless. How long can it possibly take to make pancakes and fruit salad?"}
{"text":"This place has really good homemade food.  It is so homemade that the don't even serve ketchup unless they happen to make some for a special dish.  The jam is even homemade, but they don't even have it out unless you ask for it.  

There was one weird thing, though, and if you are reading this, Harvest Moone, please learn.  When my friend and I walked in, the girl asked how many then she proceeded to ask the party behind us how many and then she said to follow her.  The people in the two parties did not even know who she was referring to so we all just followed. She proceeded to take us to another room where we were to wait.  We waited for about 2 seconds, and said follow me (again) and again the two parties did not know to whom she was referring so my friend and I just went first.  Then she took us to the table that we passed by on the way in, where she could've seated us by now.  Strange?  I am not sure about this  but I guess they don't think they have enough waiting room at the front door so they herd us all toward the back, another area near the hotel lobby.  I mean the place is really small.  But they are NOT VERY COMMUNICATIVE so we all felt like a bunch of sheep being herded every which way. 

Five words to sum it up.....strange experience but great food.

I also thought it would not be a good place for kids unless they were well-behaved and quiet because it is so small in there and the tables are very close."}
{"text":"So, a five this time is due my amazing sweet potato burger...OMG!!! The place was packed, however the service is great and the attention to fresh ingredients is amazing. My friend enjoyed the shredded chicken Cobb salad. A true delight to the Dunhill hotel & I look forward to getting back again soon!"}
{"text":"I had the Gilchrest Farms Goat Burger (Ground Goat, Sweet & Spicy BBQ Ricotta Spread, Onion Marmalade) at this authentic Farm-to-Table restaurant and I knew I was in for a treat. 

First it was very tough to pick something from their lunch menu, every description was appetizing and peaked my interest. I settled on a burger because I rarely have them anymore (long story about being vegetarian with too many exceptions). The size of their plates seemed small at first,but when you factor in the taste and quality, it was the perfect amount. This is by far the ideal balance of tasty/natural food.

Forget about ordering fries, the dishes come with a side of fresh potato salad... it's amazing. For the record I did not try the fries, I am sure they are also very good :)"}
{"text":"Buy local and support local. I appreciate that. When it comes to food though, I'm like honest Abe. I'm unbiased, unadulterated simple and plain. The food, is eh, well mediocre. 

The Banh Mi sandwich was a bit salty and wasn't very Banh Mi-like. I appreciate the effort though. The salad, with chicken..well...When the chicken is boiled, plucked/pulled and has bits of dark meat, barely any breast meat how can you not be appalled? Is this some type of new age movement? Is it because it's organic you can get away with serving scraps?

What's my honest opinion? The service is great, the decor is classy but the food is mediocre. I don't know if it's just the hype, the trendiness that has coaxed opinions but the food on their truck tasted better than the food in the restaurant."}
{"text":"The biscuits are addicting. These little innocent looking balls of joy. If you make a visit you must try a biscuit or two or several dozen! The food is all from local farms and they get two thumbs up! The smoked Trout was phenomenal. I only had a few sampling from a Yelp event, so I can't give a very long review. 
Grab a biscuit and you will be a happy, carb lovin' gal or guy!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to dine at the Harvest Moon Grille.  I heard the restaurant was the place to find really great pork dishes being that the owner ran her own farm that raised pigs.  It was also part of the pitch the dining staff gave to us and other diners as they went through the specials.  

I ordered the Grateful Grower's Pork Chop, which the waiter indicated was a favorite among their diners.  I must admit I was truly disappointed.  First at the small amount of food that I received given the meal's price, and secondly at the dish itself.  The portion of side dishes was so small that it looked more like garnish; however I could have accepted that if the chop was outstanding.  However, it was served lukewarm.  While it was juicy, it was quite bland.  While I realize some restaurants don't brine their chops, which I love, this dish really was lacking.  I guess I expected more from a restaurant that prides itself on pork dishes.  However, I will say the wait staff was friendly and accommodating.

However, you can get a better pork chop at Customshop  and at The Liberty (where's it cheaper and you get more).  If the place was cheaper I might would give it another try, but I rather spend my money elsewhere.  In the end, I found the place overpriced and extremely mediocre."}
{"text":"Have tried the food truck before so finally got around to try the restaurant for breakfast anyway.  We found the service to be on point and friendly, the coffee strong enough to actually taste and the scrambled eggs were some of the best we've had in Charlotte.  Moist, fluffy, flavorful (there may be something to this whole farm to table thing)  :) 

I was also looking forward to the sausage knowing it would be made from their Grateful Grower pork and, it met all expectations.  The only thing I would say that did not was the bacon.  While it was peppered and had a fresh, slightly sweet flavor, it was sort of limp and each piece had a portion that was undercooked.  I am not a crispy or burned bacon fan but this was a bit underdone even for me.  That's is worth just a one star ding in my book and I look forward to returning to try another meal and to keep supporting local!"}
