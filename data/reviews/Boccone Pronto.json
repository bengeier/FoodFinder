{"text":"I would give this place no stars if I could. I had the worst experience. The customer service is nonexistent. The ladies that work there are too busy gossiping in their own language to pay attention to customers. I ordered a slice of pizza and it was cold. The lady didn't even bother to warm it properly. So I took it back and asked them to warm it a little bit more. One of the ladies at the cash register takes my pizza and tosses it into the oven while giving me a dirty look. She then proceeds to just leave it in there. Five minutes later, another worker realizes there's pizza in the oven and takes out my slice and gives it to me. By now, the pizza is totally burnt from the bottom and inedible. Worst customer service I have seen and it isn't cheap either"}
{"text":"Discussing food and discussing service. Throwing up!!!!!!!! Go to another place in the airport for food. Dirty stinky and discussing food."}
{"text":"Expensive bad airport food. Panini is only hot on the outside and cold on the inside. Have to tell them they forgot half the order. Pizza made me gag. Better off getting food from somewhere with a lower price that matches the quality of the food. Metro supermarket serves better fresh2go. This place needs a restaurant takeover."}
{"text":"Worst service available even for an airport location.  Don't have high expectations when traveling through airports but here the server told us that it was too hard to make a pizza which is one of the main items on the menu. Instead suggested we buy pre made slices that were more expensive that a whole for a party of 4.  Restaurant is not clean and all around terrible service."}
{"text":"There are not many choices for food at the Toronto Pearson International Airport in Terminal 1, After-Security near the gates departing for destinations in the USA. I had a morning flight and was hungry, and since I wasn't in the mood for bagels, I decided to get some breakfast at Boccone Pronto.  I ordered the Breakfast Panini, which consisted of a thick pressed wrap filled with an egg omelette, cheese, tomatoes, and bacon. It was surprisingly good and pretty filling! And with a price of only 6 CAD before tax, there is nothing that I can really complain about."}
{"text":"They don't deserve one star but I don't know how to rate less than one star. Awful service and overpriced foods. A latino cashier was super rude and ruined my day! Avoid this place."}
{"text":"Their Margherita pizza is advertised as having tomato slices, and basil   What you actually get is similar to ellio's frozen pizza. Cheese with sauce. Totally false."}
{"text":"Just your average airport food so don't expect too much."}
{"text":"We had the eggs, bt potatoes and sausage breakfast.  The potatoes might have cost them 20 cents, they are the lowest grade of tater tots.  The sausage is okay but high in fat.  Eggs are okay but not many of them.  Customer service is worse than you could imagine.  When your food comes someone randomly screams out your order.  Not a lot of competition in this wing of the airport.  Avoid this place."}
{"text":"Since when was Lipton tea \"specialty tea\"? False advertising here as their menu advertised \"Higgins & Burke specialty tea\". Ended up paying $3.65 for a cruddy cup of Lipton tea. Nice."}
{"text":"I should've read the reviews before pursuing this over priced attempt at Italian sandwiches. The food just sucked period. The service was basic. Never again."}
{"text":"Had a 3-hour wait before my flight to the U.S., and I was very hungry.  Studied the dining options available in this part of Terminal 1, and settled on this place.  I had low expectations, but ordered the Panini Vegetariano, and it was surprisingly good.  Really a tasty combination of ingredients, and the outside bread was hot while the insides were cool (this was a good thing).  Ambience is minimal, but got to watch the airplanes, which I always enjoy."}
{"text":"I was in a hurry to get breakfast with 20 mins to go before my flight and they were quick to get my order ready. The food was average and I agree that it is overpriced. Even a bottle of water costs $4 but I guess that's airport prices for you. I ordered a scaccia which was pretty good as I was starving. It was served hot. I also ordered a chocolate croissant which was really good. Service was fast and this was on a busy weekday morning. It is a good place if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"I should have read the reviews before coming here - it would've saved me a bunch of time, a very mediocre meal, and $17. I have a low bar for airport food, and this was three strikes: overpriced, poor quality, and poor service. I would've rather had a piece of Sbarro pizza or frozen pizza.  For starters, the cashier was rude and grumpy. I was trying to decide what to order and asked her which Scacci (stromboli) was good, and she said she didn't eat the food here (that should have been a first warning sign).   Second, once I got my food, it didn't come with utensils so I went looking for a fork and knife. Normally, they would be by where you pick up your food, not behind where you order, so I asked the cashier where they were. She scowled at me and waved her hand with a rude, \"There\". They were out of forks and it took them a good 3 minutes to get someone to replace it, after I had to ask several people twice.  Third, not only was it overpriced at $17 (with tax) for a stromboli and small salad, but the food quality was poor. The salad was just a handful of not-super-fresh greens but the stromboli was the worst one I've ever had. Imagine a quesadilla, made with super thin pizza dough, then 2 hard, lukewarm mozzarella cheese, chemically tasting chicken, some spinach, tomato sauce, and some spinach. Not to mention the entire thing was oily.  I couldn't work on my laptop or touch my phone since I had greasy hands.  All in all, a very poor experience. From all accounts - food, service, and price, this was a fail. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Like every one else, I was had here as well. Quite possibly the worst slice of pizza I have ever tried to eat. And I even brought the first slice back and asked for a fresh slice, which was also inedible. It's criminal folks, shame on you Massimo"}
{"text":"There should be  a law about charging an arm and a leg for airport food when there is no place else to eat. The food has been completely unacceptable, when I am paying 14 dollars for a salad, I expect that the greens are not completely rotted.   Customer service is completely non-existent.  I attempted to get a fresh cup of coffee made for my frail grandfather when the ladies behind the counter argued with me for twenty minutes that It was fresh and hot. I proceeded to put my fingers in the coffee to demonstrate that it was cold.   I am not looking for world class service, and amazing food, but some caring about the customers would be a bonus. Surely there are better options for a bite to eat in this airport. I suggest that you look elsewhere"}
{"text":"Well, I'm never coming back here. The staff don't pay attention or do their job. After we ordered we sat down to wait or our food. When our food was ready our order wasn't called so we wasted a good 10 minutes while our food was getting cold.   Not only was our food barely warm it was extremely over priced. A pizza was $14 and it looked like 1/4 of a pizza. Their limited selection was also sitting under hear lamps.   Once we finally got our food it wasn't great. It was so oily and it was a panini.... not impressed. I wouldn't recommend this place especially if you are in a rush. Save your time and money."}
{"text":"An insult to pizza. They reheat previously made slices and it Tastes like cafeteria food. The crust is very thick, the sauce is unpleasant, overall just really bad. Avoid at all costs if you have decent standards for your pizza."}
{"text":"One might not expect a great eating experience at an airport. But today I may have gotten lucky. I ordered an unassuming slice of Canadian pizza from here. It was delicious! I was definitely surprised."}
{"text":"Not that many reasonably-priced options for such a large terminal, but at least Boccone was able to feed two of us for less than 20 bucks. The staff were nice enough, although they could have been friendlier, especially since it wasn't that busy. They ran out of a bunch of things too even though it wasn't actually late or anything (only 7pm, so it was prime dinner time), so my bf settled for a couple of slices of salami and cheese pizza. This was okayyy for airport food. Kinda bland and overpriced, but it *is* airport food after all. I'll probably try something different the next time I fly through Toronto."}
{"text":"Way to overpriced. I got a slice of tomato pizza and it was way too expensive. Seven bucks for just one slice. It wasn't even that good, The crust was way too thin and there wasn't enough sauce on it. The people who work there are also some kind of cold. Don't get it, actually, there's a Tim Hortons nearby you should get that one... it's cheaper too."}
