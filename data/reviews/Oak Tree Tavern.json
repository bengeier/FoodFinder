{"text":"Fantastic staff and service. After a long night at work I can always depend on the crew to relieve me with a nice patio beverage."}
{"text":"The Oak Tree is our favorite spot in Kensington! With Guinness and their own \"oak tree\" lager on tap, you can't go wrong. Ask for a \"tree topper\" in the summer, you won't be disappointed by the lime margarita-topped pint! 

Lots of menu variety, including a spicy and delicious vegan chili, as well as a vegan burger and deep fried pickles that can't be beat. Price is incredibly reasonable given the portion sizes. The atmosphere and servers are friendly. I only wish it was bigger, so I didn't fear not finding a seat on busy nights!"}
{"text":"Great relaxed pub, Love hitting the roof top patio on a sunny day. Food is great for a pub too."}
{"text":"I love this place, the food is amazing! So many different things going on in terms of an eclectic offering of entertainment. Comedy, live music, game nights...my one and only wish is that it was bigger!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend I come here quite a bit. Great little space, service is good, the owner is awesome, and the food is tasty! I recently ordered \"the Kensington\" Holy crap this is massive!! Its basically a huge portion of Parmesan chicken with a crisp outside and covered in cheese. But wait! ...it's on a burger! So delicious! My boyfriend always orders the salmon fish and chips, definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place, but the last couple times I've went I have not been pleased. The service sucked, the poutine was waaay too salty and the overpriced beer was warm. Will be a long while before I come back, if ever."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever had since Boogies. Absolutely delicious, very large servings.

Service is a little slow, other that that it is divine."}
{"text":"Awesome place, great food, great prices, STU is amazing, staff is always awesome with the perfect amount of nice and sarcasm. A girlfriend of mine loves their curried pickled eggs."}
{"text":"This place has an awesome patio, an awesome lager, one of the best vegan burgers in town and delicious mushroom gravy. All for a reasonable price. Definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"Went here on a rainy Friday a few weeks ago (does Calgary have any other type of Friday these days?) with a friend for a quick dinner. 

We both got burgers- can't remember what he ordered, but mine was the Applewood burger. I was really excited to try it, due to it having apples and applewood cheese - two of my favourite things to eat (asides from burgers).

So I was a little disappointed when it came out to realize that a) the patty was BONE dry and b) the applewood cheese was so thinly shaved (not even sliced!) that you couldn't taste it. My friend's burger was also dry. 

Welcoming atmosphere and semi-decent staff boost this place to a 3, but I'm more inclined to give a 2.5 - I MIGHT be willing to check them out again on a movie night or for a show, but I certainly won't be ordering a burger again."}
{"text":"Dropped by for drinks on their sunny patio and it was thoroughly enjoyable. We opted for their $5 nacho special (Sunday's?) and it was just the right size for a snack (so many other places have $16 nacho platters that are impossible for my wife and I to finish). We also tried their apple cinnamon calzone and liked it as an interesting variation on an apple turnover. They have both Wild Rose and Village Brewery beer on tap. I respect places that have local brews on tap. The Village Wit is a good one to try out if you haven't already. 

Other tables ordered burgers and mussels that looked good so we'll likely be back to try them. 

The crowd was a bit eclectic with a lot of ink on patrons and servers. There was also some live folk music which didn't seem to match with the green haired patrons but they seemed to like it. It was a little surreal but we enjoyed our first visit to the Oak Tree Tavern."}
{"text":"I feel like this place is a funky dive bar - way cooler than a 'tavern' as the name implies. It feels like the kind of place that should have a pinball machine, even if just for decoration.

We went here late on Friday night (1am-ish) for a night cap after walking into Molly Malone's and Side Street and being a bit unenthused by the clientele and music choices. Oak Tree was a welcome change with it's softer tunes, ability to have a conversation, chilled out vibe, free tables to sit down at and decent beers on tap. It's also the only bar that I've been to where they haven't been playing sport on the flat screen TV (Princess Bride was screening last night).

The waitress came over to the table straight away and was super friendly. They don't have many beers on tap here (5 or 6) but they have a Black Lager by Last Best that I really like, and I much prefer quality over quantity. Plus I love that they have booths, because I'm lazy and like to sit in comfort.

I didn't have food here this time given the time of day, but I sampled some of their new menu last month and was a fan of whichever burger I had and the spicy tuna poppers. And now I'm hungry..."}
{"text":"This place used to be Jupiter but has changed over to the Oak tree tavern. Not sure when the switch was made, and I've actually never been to this place when it was Jupiter so I don't know if they've reno'd it or made any changes at all. 

Stopped in on a stunner of a day, sun was blazing and the sun and salsa festival was going on in Kensington. When we stopped in the place was empty but as during our stay the patio filled up. 

We tried two appys, the sliders and the curry fries. Curry fries were a miss and the sliders were okay.  I am quite sure the patties for the sliders came pre-made (frozen?), they could easily elevate this dish by making the patties in house. I was quite curious about trying a salad, the choices sounded good and I would likely try one of these when I come back. 

Love the patio. Love that they have village brewery on tap. I will be back for another pint of blonde in the sunshine.  

Also, this place would pair nicely with a market collective afternoon :)"}
{"text":"Best vegan burger in Calgary. Seriously. 
Only a few taps, but cozy atmosphere. Will be coming back for the food for sure, and the patio is pretty stellar as well."}
{"text":"Love their Oak Tree Lager (only 5.75/ pint!) and their Dill Pickle Soup can't be beat! Atmosphere is great, always playing classic films on a big screen with different genres of music playing. My boyfriend and I live really close and the Oak Tree is our go-to when we want a bite to eat or want to show friends around. St. Paddy's day is a blast here, too (Get a shot of Writers' Tears with a guiness)! Curry Fries are a must-have."}
{"text":"Went with a friend and her young son for some snacks on a Tuesday night. We got a seat on the patio and a high chair with no hassle from the staff for bringing in a little one. The service was quick and attentive when we needed it and they left us alone to catch up when we didn't need anything. The food was plentiful and lovely options beyond the regular pub options you usually get.

Tried the goats cheese and beet bruschetta which came with tons of toppings and was fresh and tasty. The poutine was just the right amount of cheesy goodness and the tuna poppers were ok.

Friendly staff and they told us about all the events they have through the week, definitely need to come back for bingo on a Tuesday and check it out. All in all lovely patio and restaurant hidden from the busy of Kensington. Loved that they didn't make a fuss about us having a well behaved little one with us and helped us get the bill quickly when he was ready to go so we could leave before disturbing everyone else. Definitely going to be back!"}
{"text":"People have told me to give this place another chance. Maybe I was just imagining the stank face from the previous visit, and I was really just seeing the glassy harried face of waitresses that were overwhelmed due to a packed bar. 

So, this was the place I recommended when a friend from out of town was visiting and we needed somewhere that would accomodate the omnivores, the herbivore and the intolerantivores.


I arrived for the second half of a reunion, and caught the tail-end of an awesome waitress. My friends remarked on how friendly and fast she was. When she left, we were stuck with a waitress, whom, while later proved to be knowledgable about the menu items; never bothered to give me a menu. When I asked for one, the lady next to me offered me hers as she had finished looking at it, and the waitress took that as a sign to not bother. 

The wine spritzer on the drink menu is actually Catalina canned wine (hey, baby. Let's you and me take this six-pack of wine to the beach), but if you want a white wine spritzer in a glass, they can make you one for an extra $3. I'm not so uppity that I'll turn down canned wine, and it actually isn't bad. I was never offered another one, though, and neither was anyone else. Not a glass of water, nothing. Restaurants, this is your moment to shine. While sensible me will try to be content with one drink, if you offer, I will gladly agree to another. And another. You can make fat bank on me with just drinks alone, if only you ask!

Our table had a steak and two burgers: one beef, one vegan burger. If you have a gluten sensitivity, the vegan burger is bound together with breadcrumbs. I opted for their side quinoa salad and french fries. The quinoa salad and french fries portion were fairly generous, so I wasn't that upset that I couldn't have the vegan burger. The lady that did order it remarked that it was delicious. The quinoa salad and fries were okay, a little oily, but if I was rating just the food, they would've been a solid 3. 

The food took quite a while to come out, but I would have minded more if I wasn't busy catching up with an old friend that I haven't seen in ages. Service was incredibly slow, we were never checked on, and someone at our table pointed out that our waitress was watching the game when some of us were waiting for our bill. 

The bathroom is fairly clean. I appreciate the night stand/corner table placed in front of the toilet. It's the perfect height for slumping over if you're relieving yourself and you're too drunk to function. As well, I like that there's a garbage can just outside of the door, so you can use a paper towel to turn the door handle.

When I came out of the bathroom, I noticed our waitress talking to a group of guys that had decided to sit down at our table, and taking their drink orders. Um, hello... whodafuckareyou. While yes, my friend and I were leaving, giving us the courtesy to actually vacate first would've been good form, dudes. 

Even better form would have been the waitress telling them so, rather than slapping a bill in front of me without making eye contact and saying, \"oh, you're leaving, right?\" I felt like I was being shoved out the door. Maybe my bill wasn't that high, but again, there was zero effort made to sell me on anything other than what I had ordered. On patron husbandry, she gets a C.

So, yeah. I want to like Oak Tree, but based on Friday's experience; I feel like I should have just trusted my initial instinct. I'll go if I'm invited, but it's not going to be a place I'll seek out on my own."}
{"text":"The oak tree is a dive bar, but hey you can't complain paying $5,5 for a house lager that is actually decent. Food is so so but great patio!"}
{"text":"Surprised this place doesn't have better reviews. I have been coming for consistently good food & service almost weekly for over a year...& I would say my standards are high. We used to come here as a big group for work lunches too, & they always managed to get our food out fast despite the large table size & please everyone at the table as well! 
They do an amazing vegan burger, their meatloaf is so good, as is the fish & chips. Plus they aren't pretentious (a major plus!)"}
{"text":"This is a great pub.  It is probably the best Guinness that I have had in Canada.  Apparently the Guinness is pressurized with Nitro (nitrogen) in accordance with the recommendations made by the Guinness company.  Many pubs use Carbon dioxide which spoils the Guinness. The burgers are great.  Unfortunately the fish and chips are not that great.  The chips being the shoestring type which I am not keen on. The service is excellent and the ambiance is fantastic,  particularly on Sunday evening when live Irish music is being played. I would thoroughly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The Oak Tree Tavern is a great pub. What's so different about it? It's got a few great touches that make it extra wonderful, but the real question is: Why does a great pub need to be different? A neighbourhood pub is a community gathering place for all different members of the neighbourhood to gather over a pint - Oak Tree does this very well.

But, as for the little things that stand out in my mind - here they are:

They've only got 5 taps and they're one of the only places I know that has Last Best Dirty Bird Black Pilsner (or lager, I can't remember). But they're more concerned with having good beer on tap and supporting their community, than they are about playing it safe. I like that, Oak Tree.

For their menu, they do a great job of adding something a little special - a bit of interest that will still satisfy your tried and true pub food cravings for burgers, nachos and poutine. They have a tonne of Gluten Free options - some interesting takes on classics, like the Curry Fries topped with this delicious coconut curry and yogurt. 

They've also got several \"MealShare\" items. If you buy a MealShare item, you will buy a meal for someone at the Calgary Drop In Centre. Definitely a cause I'm willing to eat deep fried pickles for. 

Beer battered Fish & Chips made with Last Best Brewing's \"Dirty Bird\" black pilsner and locally roasted Kienna coffee from The Coffee Market are a few nice local things they do. 

Now, I'm not talking special as in high end gastropub food here, but they do make an effort to use high quality ingredients while supporting the local scene. It's still pub food and it's definitely good. Personally, I think it's good not to be \"gastro\".

I'd really like to check out the \"Monday Night Movie\" that they. They have cozy booths, a wood stove and the right kind of place to drink pints with friends and watch a movie while the winter blizzards on outside.

The bottom line with Oak Tree is that they are a neighbourhood pub - not a pretentious one. It's the kind of place where you get to know the servers and chat it up with the regulars and I really, really like that."}
{"text":"Bit of a dive bar, but I like the staff. If you aren't a hipster, you'll feel old and out of place here. My friend and I came for Tuesday bingo. That was fun but if you have more than two cards, listen carefully as the host talks pretty quick and he sometimes gives two numbers at once. 

No cheap drink specials when I went. My friend and I shared the vegetarian poutine that was tasty and cheap, as it half off that night. Good place to end the night."}
{"text":"The Klondike burger which was their offering for YYCBurger week enticed me to this place. It was Tuesday afternoon and we went there at 11:30 in case there was a lunch rush. It's a nice enough place, fairly small and had some interesting items on the menu like curried fries and some vegan items but we were there for burgers. The Klondike burger is unpretentiously described as Bannock + Elk + Sage + Cranberries. The kitchen obligingly substituted the fries for a green salad for me when I pleaded diabetes and watching my carb intake. The salad was fresh with a commercial roasted tomato vinagrette. The burger came and looked as promised by the photo on yycburgerweek.com It is a bit messy to eat as the patty is topped with house made cranberry sauce but worth the mess. For elk the patty was surprisingly not dry and quite delicious, not gamey at all and the cranberry sauce had a nice tartness that added to flavour of the patty. I couldn't really taste the sage.The bannock was a little on the greasy side but all in all a good burger. Service was fast and friendly. The burger was $15 but I would have paid $20 for it. The portions were generous and my friends who had the fries said that they were good fries."}
{"text":"Great spot that offers good pub fare, a great beer selection, and they support local live music. Very cool bartenders and servers."}
{"text":"I thought Oaktree might be a nice place togo. It was fine the beer was good once the food arrived though it was not good at all. Tasted mushy and strange and the dessert was probably the worst I've ever had. I tried to give the server my opionion even though they never even came to the table and asked how the food was, then she proceeded to tell me that she had tried the same meal the week before and completely overlooked my comment didn't give me the respect of a customer and proceeded to tell me that she enjoyed the dish that I did not. I was just trying to give them feedback on how I felt about the food yet she decided to rebuttal her opinion thus's making me feel uncomfortable and not letting the costumer voice their opinion being in the restaurant industry myself this baffled me because I could not understand why somebody would want to give such poor customer service. Customer service should be number one at a restaurant but that didn't appear to be how it was there. Unfortunately the situation did not go over well I will not be back. My opinion has very much changed about this place... Terrible food bad service won't be back."}
{"text":"Maybe the worst service in Kensington. Can't comment on the food or beverages, since, after sitting for 10 minutes, we walked out after a second server strolled past our table without taking a drink order or offering a menu. Went down the street and had a fantastic meal with superlative service at a buzzing Pulcinella."}
{"text":"Poutine - good. Happy hour - good. Music bingo - good.
The bad...... UNCOOKED fish and chips.... we order 2 pieces and only one came out. Asked for the second, it came out... raw. GROSS. Had to ask for new forks and once again new fish.
When it came out cooked it was ok.
Caeasr Salad was weird. super watery.
Otherwise a fun time. I recommend Music Bingo"}
{"text":"First attempt, I really like this place. But need to go back and do further investigation!
They have Live music at times, a fantastic Patio and really good service.
This is not your typical calgary pub or bar, it has its own character, even the clientelle are different from what you usually see in other places."}
{"text":"Came here for a Yelp event yesterday, loved the patio here even though it was super windy. The servers were super nice, and service was quick and efficient; it did take a bit of time for us to get our bill though.

Between the three of us, we got two appetizers to try. Their spicy tuna poppers had the perfect amount of batter to them; totally looked like deep fried oreos from afar. They came with a good helping of wasabi aioli, which was perfect to balance out the slight spiciness of the tuna rolls.

We also got their curry fries. Loved their spicy coconut curry and mass of green onions topping the fries. We spent a good amount of time trying to figure out what would be a better fry base for the dish. We like the fries, but found them to get soggy too quickly. The sauce reminded us of butter chicken, and I think if given the choice, I would totally add chicken to this to jazz it up.

Overall, great experience here yesterday. Would highly recommend their patio for some quick drinks and appies."}
{"text":"I recall walking by Oak Tree Tavern oncewhile in Kensington, and thinking it was an adorable name for a pub and it was something that I would name my own pub and there and the inside would be akin to the setting of Fantastic Mr. Fox and there would be acorns. 

Upon going home and looking up their menu, I noticed several items clearly marked vegan. This included a veggie burger, chili and subsequent chill fries, yummy, salads, etc. I tried the veggie burger on my first visit, and paired it with a pint of Village Blonde. It was pretty yummy, but my friend remarked her fries tasted like they'd been put through the deep-fryer a couple times which doesn't sound too appealing to me. 

The next time I visited Village was I believe on a Tuesday, where I watched live music and caught up with a friend. Very cozy when used as a venue, and hoping to try out one of their Movie Mondays soon. 

Last time I visited though, I was a little disappointed to see they'd removed some items off the menu, namely the vegan chilli. FIRST WILD ROSE, NOW YOU GUYS?!?!? I didn't even get to try their chilli to be honest, so it could have been awful and they could have been doing me a favour. However, I am bummed that the menu is now a little more limited to us herbivores. 

I will continue to visit the Oak Tree and cross my fingers for more nomz I can eat in the future, because who doesn't like nomming down on vegan pub food once in awhile after a long day, or enjoying a cider on the patio?! 

Oh. Also, I have never experienced anything but pleasant service. The servers are always super friendly (though once when it was busy we kind of found our own nook to sit, just like I have at many pubs) and always engage in conversation. I will talk anyone's ear off about the purse I bought on ModCloth if they ask, so I'm glad they are tolerant. :)"}
{"text":"I'm a regular because of the people, the food, and the beer selection. I like the seasonal menu changes, and the fact that they make a LOT from scratch. The owner is easy to work with for events/parties and has become a good friend. 

Word of the Wise: Their chef, Nicole, is the Soup Wizard. Seriously, you have to try her soups. She has a talent!"}
{"text":"My favorite pub in Kensington! I like the relax and warm atmosphere, the good selection of beers on tap that changes regularly, the music, the movies projected, the staff. And I love the patio during the summer!
The food are not bad at all (tried the other day the soup of day that was coconut curry yam), but a bit too salty in general for my taste."}
{"text":"My friend recently introduced me to this great little community pub in the heart of Kensington. They offer a range of vegan dishes (very rare for a pub), and the customer service is excellent. This place has a great vibe to it and is the perfect place to catch up with friends over good food & drink- I will be back!"}
{"text":"Service, service, service. The making or breaking point of many pubs. Why do so many places seem to miss the mark on this? Regardless of how awesome in every other way a pub is, it can't be a great pub without good customer service.

Since moving to Kensington I have been wanting to try this place out. We decided to make our first visit on their music bingo night. 

The pub itself was nice. Great patio, cozy/relaxed atmosphere. Upon first sitting down I thought I was really going to like the place and was already envisioning myself as a regular. Just the relaxed type of atmosphere that I like to enjoy a cold beer in after a hard days work. The type of place where you can just go as you are, no need to get fancied up. The host of the music bingo was awesome, and the whole thing was really fun! I also noticed they often have other things going on such as movie nights on Mondays, live music, comedy on Wednesday etc. I really enjoy when places have this sort of entertainment and would definitely have decided to frequent this place regularly ( especially now that I live down the street) had it not been for a few fatal flaws.

Upon sitting down we were greeted by a server. She didn't do anything that was specifically rude but you could tell she wasn't impressed with being there. This alone could have been overlooked. Anyway she gave us our menus and took our drink orders right away. She didn't return to take our food orders until the beers were almost gone ( 25 mins later) Had this been another pub without awesome music bingo happening would probably have just forgotten about getting food, paid for the drinks and left.
She finally took our orders ( from a somewhat limited menu) and I had the half nachos with chicken added and my husband had the poutine. No complaints about the food. I enjoyed my nachos and tasted his poutine and it was excellent. Again, had it not been for the service issues this would have been more points towards making it a regular spot for us.
So after our food the slow service continued. I couldn't see any waitresses anywhere. It seemed she was just hanging out in the back. We sat forever with empty beers. I would have been more than happy to keep the beer flowing had she just come around to offer them to us.
Now on to the second major problem. We eventually decided to ask for our bill( from a nicer server, Im guessing the other one went home) When the bill came we just paid right away without really reviewing it. We were tired of waiting around and just wanted to get going. When we looked at it on the way out we noticed that we were charged $18 for the small Nachos plus the $4 for the added chicken. This put the half order of nachos at $22. Now the thing is, it wasn't like she entered it in wrong, it said Small nacho on our bill ( not the large), its just the price on the menu for the small or half nacho was $14 and the large or full size was $18. But for whatever reason the small nacho cost $18. I am not sure if something sneaky was going on here or if they simply need to update the prices on their menu, but either way it left me with a bitter taste.

Overall I will still give this place a 3/5 despite the ridiculously slow and unfriendly service and despite the sketchy overcharging of the nachos simply because of the awesomeness of the music bingo, the good atmosphere, the good food, and all the entertainment offered. This place has a lot of potential, just pick it up with the service.
I will give it another chance though."}
