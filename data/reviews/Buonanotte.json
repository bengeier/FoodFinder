{"text":"Pompous service for no reason, high prices for no reason, tasteless food  with the exception of pizza. Screwed up duck fat fries!!! Takes talent to do that!
Half empty place FOR VERY GOOD REASON!"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant yesterday, and I should have read the yelp reviews. I would have passed.

We arrived relatively early because we were going to see a play at the Royal Alexandria.  Service was nice and friendly and for the most part prompt. The decor was warm, inviting and modern. I was really excited to try this place out. 

We ordered the deep fried calamari and shrimp. While it was cooked well and breaded tastily, it did not come with any dipping sauce. I've never not been served dipping sauce with this dish, so it was really quite boring after the 5th piece.

My cousin ordered the $30 Buonanotte pizza. For $30, canned, squishy mushrooms is NOT acceptable. She loves mushrooms and has to leave them on the side. She did say the dough was cooked well.

I ordered the seafood pasta. For $26 the portion was quite small. All my 7 mussels were out of their shells (but they still put the empty shells in the bowl?? I got 1 shrimp and 3 pieces of calamari. The sauce was SUPER oily and the pasta was ridiculously undercooked. I know al dente, and this was like al dente's frigid aunt forgotten outside after a night of partying (aka super dehydrated). 

Now, I am a pretty passive aggressive person (hence, writing a review in lieu of making a fuss in the restaurant), however, I really would have liked to bring this to the chef's attention if we weren't in a rush to make it to the play. I needed SOMETHING to eat and was seriously contemplating the street meat at the corner of John and King St.

Anyway, will not be going back and will be telling all my friends to avoid this place. I don't know how they will make it with food lacking this much."}
{"text":"I ordered the steak but it was when I didn't know ordering it medium / rare was the best way to have it. I ordered it almost well done which ruined it for me. Experience was nice, but I expected more since this was a \" higher \" end restaurant."}
{"text":"Come here for the club only, not the food.

Sampled some pizza, calamari, arugula salad, and meatballs to start. All fell short due to lack of seasoning. I had the spaghetti type dish for an entree, and the sauce was too sweet for my liking; it was very Roman style. My friends all said the salmon was fine/good, but no one really had a great thing to say about the food.

The service here really left something to be desired; it was painfully slow. The waitresses were all dimes though, if you are into that sort of thing; they just lacked brains/personality/ability to deliver good service.

The club, conversely, was amazing. It was simply bananas in there. The DJ (a Saturday night) crushed it with a mix of EDM/Hip-Hop.

Tip - if you are single, this is the place for you, tons of beautiful and diverse people."}
{"text":"I was at this place for my birthday celebration on Saturday night. The night had both some highs but sadly many lows. 

The pros of this place: atmosphere and menu were pretty good. 

The cons: First of all, they would NOT do a separate bills. What this does at the end of the night is confusion and frustration. They also sneak in the 18% gratuity, which I think is tacky considering service is something that a consumer should choose and not have imposed. There was one member in our party who came to dinner in shorts which he was served, fed, and then asked to leave because he wasn't following dress code. Forget that it was over 35 degrees and he's a professional wearing a nice polo, but to take your money and then asked to leave- not cool. Neither is a rude staff member calling him white trash.

I will NOT be going back to this establishment as long as this is the service that is offered. For 1000$ bill, I expect way more."}
{"text":"Extremely small portions. Trying to be too pretentious. Went there for lunch. The waiter was extremely rude, we had 3 orders of the gnocchi and all 3 had different amounts in the plate. One plate had half the amount as another. When we mentioned it to the waiter he said that it was normal. The calamari was pure garbage. Only gave the body of the squid not the legs. And I'm pretty sure it was frozen. It was served with a spicy mayo. Who the hell gives mayo for calamari??? Don't even bother going unless you want crap service and overpriced small portions. My meatball panini wasn't even pressed in a panini machine and honestly the meatballs at subway taste better. I'm a local and I was so surprised because it has a good reputation. But just the terrible service is enough to never return. Hopefully I don't get shot by the mafia who run the place for writing this."}
{"text":"Literally the WORST experience ever. We organized a party of 18 for a bachelorette party and could not believe how awful the staff and ambiance were. A downtown restaurant that can't adequately accommodate a gluten intolerance?!
Manager was rude and condescending. Do not waste your time or money on this hole. Surprised they managed to stay in business treating people this way. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Came here for a corporate Christmas party. Because of this, unlike what others may be saying, we ordered the full course meal for groups and the price seemed very reasonable.

The meal began with 3 appetizers that could be shared amongst the group. This included delicious meatballs, a grilled vege and goat cheese roll, and some fried calamari which is always a hit. An assortment of pizzas were also distributed to the table for tasting even though it was not specified on the menu. These pizzas were my favourite part of the meal, and the assortment of choices was very much appreciated.

Next up was a first course of pasta, which was tasty, but nothing special really. For the second course we were given then option of beef or salmon. I had the the beef, which came with a purée of sorts. The purée was very good and necessary for giving the beef a little more flavour.

Finally was the dessert which was my least favourite part of the meal. This could be because we had all gotten pretty full, but the cake was dry and not very tasty at all. Many of the desserts were left uneaten.

The worst part of the place is really the bar. The drinks are expensive like any Montreal establishment. I tried ordering a scotch and soda and was trying to tell the girl I didn't want her to use single malt scotch. After asking for a blended scotch she ended up giving me rum. I gave up at this point and just took my drink and switched to gin and tonic for the night.

Overall of very nice dining experience. Not sure I would go back however since I think there are many better places in the Montreal area."}
{"text":"I recently went to Buona Notte for a bachelor/bachelorette party dinner. It was my first time eating at a supper club in Montreal. I was told the waitresses were some of the most gorgeous women in the city and they did not disappoint. There's an interesting atmosphere to the club because it presents a high class feeling yet people are allowed to wear jeans and button-down shirts. You'll see tons of different people there but it seems to be populated with company parties and bachelor/bachelorette groups. However, despite the high-end feeling, the service is quite slow and it gets a little hectic at times. The food variety is streamlined and easy to figure out but lacking in variety and is quite expensive. Even when my food came out (cheapest option) it did not live up to the $15 price tag. Be careful of the drinks because they'll add up in a heartbeat. At around 12 the kitchen closes and the tables are removed to convert it into a dance club.

In the end - If you're going on the weekend you might have trouble finding a table due to all the reservations. You also have to be somewhat dressed up, so no ripped jeans or sneakers. I was a little bit disappointed because it didn't really live up to its name. I don't think I'll go back but it was a interesting experience."}
{"text":"I was worried about this place when I read reviews. Had so much fun! Work Xmas party last night.  Service was great and the food was beyond amazing. Craving that pizza again. Servers were super nice and accommodating.  There was about 50 of us and we had our own bar. Maybe service is crap when there is only a few ppl at a table? I highly recommend  this place for a work function. By far my fave Xmas party"}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere, great food, amazing cocktails. The wait staff are attentive and friendly. They offer great portions for sharing and the steak is amazing."}
{"text":"Believe the reviews, this place is horrible. I came for a bachelorette party and we had a set menu with some vegetarian modifications. Pasta was not fresh and bland. Calamari over cooked, served cold and way too salty. For a place with a pizza oven, all the bread/pizza was served cold. Food was either not seasoned at all or incredibly salty. The mark up on wine is ridiculous and $40 for corkage if you bring your own is laughable. Considering it was a bachelorette, I was shocked how slow the servers were about replenishing drinks. The server tried to take a bottle of wine that wasn't finished. Settling up was a nightmare and she actually just laid all of her receipts down and walked away. The manager did give us a bottle of $12 Prosecco on the house and offered us better wine for no charge when they ran out of what we were drinking but the general quality of service and food can't be made up for. The washrooms were filthy and I was shocked to see that someone brought a child with them to a place that turns into a nightclub. There was an honest to God 12 year old walking around in this place after midnight. They were also playing the TFC game at the bar which our table was near so we were swarmed by dude bros. The worst!"}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends for a birthday dinner. I did not enjoy it, which was disappointing because I really wanted to! 

I had the steak tartar as an app, which was fine. But the gnocchi was awful! It was so mushy and bland. It tasted overcooked. My boyfriend had a steak, which I tried. It was tough and dry. The birthday girl had the rabbit stuffed pasta. I tried that as well and found the stuffing to be super dry and flavourless! 

I went back on another occasion (because it is very conveniently located) and had a white sauce pizza with mushrooms. I actually enjoyed that, although it was served a bit cold. I also had a bottle of wine with the pizza, which might be why I thought the pizza was so good.

I'd say get a pizza because those are ok. But overall the quality is too poor to justify the prices, which are fairly high. I'm totally willing to pay for a great meal, Buonanotte just doesn't serve one. The waitresses look good though."}
{"text":"You don't come for the food, which is just average, you come for the club experience afterward.

However, if you want to avoid waiting in line, only whether to be allowed in at the discretion of the bouncer, you might as well come for dinner.  Honestly, the food can range from being edible to actually not bad.  It really depends on the day you go on whether the service is good or the food is bad, etc.  

I have been a couple times where they messed up my order (I got a topped pizza, but a plain cheese one came out instead), but they remedied the situation rather swiftly and all was forgiven.  And in actuality, the pizza wasn't that bad.  I have also been where it took a long time for the food to come out after ordering.  Granted it was a busy night, but you come to expect this sort of thing.

The service is not bad, waitresses are hot and pleasant (as well as pleasant to look at).  A little after 11 the waitress change clothes into more cocktaily dresses and the restaurant turns into a club where the last few diners are finishing up and the tables are turned into \"tables\".  

Basically everyone orders bottle service at Buona.  You would be a fool not to, because the prices will inevitably be very similar to if everyone was ordering individual drinks.  You also get the luxury of having a \"table\" and I use this term loosely.  It is nothing more than a regular restaurant table with a white table cloth on top, with which you can stand around feeling superior to the plebes that don't have one, but in reality everyone else seems to have that same ideology, but I digress.

The music is an eclectic mix of hip hop, dance, house, top 40, etc.  It is definitely a fun place to party and there are tons of gorgeous women that frequent the establishment.  With other establishments having problems (I wont name names), this is the place to go on the Main."}
{"text":"This place looks good and the vibe there was good. 
The issue we had yesterday (Friday night) was with the waitress and the food.., the waitress had no clue on the menu!, she said she is new and that she can't even pronounce the dishes.., she also admitted that screwed up our order and didn't know how to do it with the kitchen, so we got the pizza first, after 15 minutes the salad showed up, and 15 minutes later the appetizer came (and in not exaggerating with the times). The pizza was ok but had a bit of an off taste, the salad was soaking in vinegar and was almost not edible, and the bruschetta was the only thing I can rank as good."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite restaurant in town. It is extremely chic with very good looking waiters and waitress, def a ppl watching spot. btw, the pretty waiter/tresses are not the 'good looking but bitchy' kind. They are nice! :-) Excellent Italian & wine. They have an awesome wine cellar with an extensive list of wine from Italy. The wall of fame is truly fun to look at. That been said, you have to be happy to pay $16 + Tax for a small plate of salad to be a fan of this place."}
{"text":"Place looked cool from the outside so thought we'd check it out. We were seated in the lounge section which was empty. 

So we were waiting for 20 minutes until I decided to actually go and call a waiter to take our order.

It's a lounge so it's supposed to be lively right? Nope. The place had no music playing and again, after becoming sick of the dead atmosphere I asked for them to turn the music on.

The waiter came with our order and it's a 5 star restaurant so your expect a little hospitality or good service. Waiter might as well have thrown the drinks at us. No napkins, didn't even pour the bottle for us.

Lastly, the sound system (AFTER we asked for the music to be turned on) kept popping and making these loud exploding noises which was unnerving.

The only good part of this place is that they have pretty girls serving you but they're too busy looking at themselves in the mirror rather than taking your order."}
{"text":"Recently visited this establishment as a part of a bachelor party. Was setup by a bachelor party tour company. The restaurant/club caters as such to this clientele; attractive waitresses and bartenders galore. Seems like a good place to start a good night? WRONG!!!!

The service is atrocious. Challenging to get a drink. Looking at other tables in our area and they faced the same issues. You are essentially paying for an attractive waitress, however ours was never around our table. Improper orders. Really average food. Save your money for a more authentic Montreal
Experience at a city chalked full of great places."}
{"text":"The worst service EVER!!! Tasteless food!! I was there for a corporate event for Great West Life and had a terrible experience. Waiters and waitresses just ran around like chickens with their heads cut off. No organization to their service. Our table didn't receive two of the four appetizers- no calamari or pizza - and when we mentioned it to a couple of waiters they just shrugged their shoulders. The meatballs were very good as was the bread - the two appetizers we did receive. The filet steak was absolutely tasteless and whatever was beneath it resembled vomit - terrible presentation. Will never return even if someone else is paying."}
{"text":"Overpriced douchefest. Avoid at all costs. This place is taking up space on precious Toronto real estate. I had the gnocchi, it was wet potato balls in watery tomato gravy. Our particular server acted as if she was doing us a favour so if you like that please book your table today. Your group will also enjoy the privilege of paying a mandatory 18% tip to be ignored. It's next to Second City... Maybe it's performance art that hasn't ended yet? Please close down."}
{"text":"So mad right now!  They spilled drinks and broken glass all over me.  Accidents happen so no big deal, but they offered to bring me a drink to compensate me and it never materialized.  What pisses me off is that I bought 2 drinks and had only 2 sips before their staff cleared it!  WTF!!  Horrible customer service!!"}
{"text":"I was here for the day with large group. Food & attention was on point. Salmon was delicious!"}
{"text":"Not going to regurgitate what others have already mentioned about the service and food.  Would not recommend this restaurant.  Only saving grace is the attentive waitress."}
{"text":"I finally decided to give this place a chance after walking by there everyday on my way home. From the outside, the decor looks modern and attractive.
Making a last-minute reservation on a Friday night was not very difficult. Used Opentable to book. It was simple as that. 
Now the experience.
The food is mediocre.  The pizza they breg about is really burnt black on the bottom. It doesn't look burnt on the top at all, but the bottom was...I know a few of the other reviews mentioned this, so this is not an isolated case.
The pasta was not so great either. All I could think while eating here is Pizza Rustica around the corner. LOL. That would have been a much better choice.
Only thing that was good from this place was the small amuse-bouche they give you in the beginning. Honestly, that was soooo delicious. But after that it hit rock bottom.
The service was bad. They are nice when they talk to you....if you have the honour of getting their attention. It took 30 mins for our server to bring us water and wine. This is when she finally took our food order. The place was not even that busy. I saw about two other servers just chatting for awhile and two other guys who may be managers/owners (since they weren't attending to any tables) just standing arounding or leaning by a wall. Not impressed at all.
If you don't care for good food and just want a nice ambiance where you are not attended by the servers, then this might not be so bad.
But for me, I will never return here again."}
{"text":"There are some clubs where all you need is a dance floor and $25 to have the time of your life.
This isn't one of them - 
Buena is the place to be on a Friday night. Restaurant turns into a club - and therefore the most atypical club I've been to so far.
You need a table but 
Bottle service/service in general is quite horrendous - took the hostess 30 mins to stave lingering diners off our table. Look out for inefficient waitresses."}
{"text":"Bad food, bad service!! Would never go back.  They should take a lesson from neighbouring clubs on how to run bottle service and treat your guests.  The owners need better management running this place."}
{"text":"this place has beautiful wrapping:  vibe, music , layout in the restaurant. However, nothing under the wrapping - food = nop. I did gave a chance, I did try at least 3 times, guess what same conclusion.

for example: the pasta were really bland. well it make me feel better about my cooking, I can do better really.

this place is good to party and been see, drinks after 22h00 yes, food. hmm maybe one day when they change the chef"}
{"text":"To start off with, I've worked in the service industry for 4 years, so not only am I more lenient than most, but I know what they're going through. 

This place was the worst. We had a group of people there (maybe 20 or so). They would a) NOT split the bills and b) only allowed us to pick from a fixed menus. 

Firstly, not splitting bills is amateur - almost every restaurant worth anything nowadays has a system that makes this incredibly easy. And I mean regular, run of the mill restaurants would have this. 

Secondly, I understand the fixed menu thing - it creates for less confusion and people getting their food at the same time. However, charging $45/ person and only giving you TWO options (pasta and pizza) is awful. Not to mention, the two options that probably have the highest markup. The pizza was alright, the pasta (my wife's) was awful. 

Their only - and I mean ONLY - thing that was good was their shrimp in their calamari, that earned them the one star. My wife's $16 house wine glass took about 30 minutes to make it to the table, my water (not a drinker) was often empty. 

At the end of the night, they do not tell you that tip is included (I'm a pretty generous tipper anyways, as I worked in the industry and you have to be AWFUL to get my standard 15%). So I ended up tipping twice due to the confusion. 

You couldn't pay me to go back to that place. Would recommend to my enemies."}
{"text":"The restaurant was legit empty when we got there at 5:45 for our 6:00 reservation. As in we were the only ones there. Yet we were told by the hostess AND our waitress that we HAD to be done with dinner by 9pm because our table was booked. Very odd, and by the time we were done with dinner at 7:15, there were only 4 other tables seated. However we realized why they were so worried about kicking us out. We walked by again at around 11 after the show at Second City, and there was a line out the door. This place turns into a Techno Nightclub. That's why they want you out, so they can move the tables and set up their dance floors. It made sense after, and also as to why the waitresses were wearing skimpy cocktail dresses.

Food was not good. However, if we knew beforehand that this place was more interested in being a night club than a restaurant, we never would have gone!"}
{"text":"This is an interesting place. The interior seems somewhat inspired by Studio 54 and the wait staff looks like they stepped out of a Robert Palmer video. They had a DJ and bar with a number of Jersey Shore types hanging out at it.

But there's also a lot of table seating like it's a trendy restaurant. It's defintely not a place for a romantic evening.

I had the lasagna, and it was good, served in an individual 6x6 baking pan which was a cute touch. The pizzas seemed good, but the calzone turned out to be a bit crust-heavy.

Our waitress was very nice and informative. Be sure to check out the autographed plates near the front door, signed by the various celebrities that have dined there."}
{"text":"I've only been here once (once was enough) for a friends bachelorette party on a Saturday night around 9:30.  We were told in advance that each person had to order $25 worth, which was fine. I understand that they don't want people just sitting there nursing a soft drink all night. 

We were quickly shown to our table, while we waited for the rest of our party.  The music was good and the decor was nice.  

Our waitress told us each person seated had to order at least $25 of food (drinks not included) or they would bill the table the difference.  We knew each person had to order $25, but were never told that wine/drinks with the meal didn't count. Some people only wanted appetizers/drinks, but didn't want to force the difference on other people. Others planned on ordering more..

We were waiting for a few more people, but couldn't order until the rest of the group got there (maybe 2-3 people out of about 16). If they left the chairs for our friends, we had to guarantee that they would come, otherwise the rest of the table would be charged $25 for each seat.  Wow. Really? The place was hardly full ... 

So, I ordered my mandatory food.  Calamari, rucola and parmesan salad, and a glass of wine.  Now, if you're going to force feed me, at least make it palatable. The breaded/fried calamari were soggy and lukewarm, and the salad was bland.  I'm not sure how others felt about their food. 

I really do not recommend this place.  There are a number of other supper clubs in the area."}
{"text":"came here for a weekend with 2 of my girlfriends - was told by 3 different people to check this spot out, so we reserved a table for dinner saturday night at 10pm. waited 30 mins to be seated (kitchen closes at 11pm) - hostess offered if we'd like to eat at the bar in because she can't kick people off their tables. not her fault, but why overbook? finally we get seated all the way in the back, in a total separate part of the restaurant & the table was strange - one side was a booth, the other side were chairs. i was basically sitting on the floor (on the booth side) as my friends were way above me. 

our waiter was beyond amazing - he was so attentive, super sweet & friendly. 

Food was good - we got the fried calamari which was VERY salty but good. i got basic pasta with tomato, basil & EVOO. pasta was a bit too al dente, but very flavorful. we stayed after dinner for the night party which was not my scene at all. everybody was on top of each other, people were drunk walking in our booth with their dirty wet shoes. music was good (Hip hop/rap). crowd reminded me of drunk frat kids & the girls were bottle rats.

it was a fun/interesting experience but not sure if i would return."}
{"text":"I went here for after work drinks on their weekly Thursday networking event.  The decor is modern with spacious seating.  During the event they set up tables with free appetizers such as pizza, calamari, cheese and bruschetta. 

I can't comment on the dinner or late night music scene but the two times I've gone the staff has been very nice."}
{"text":"The most pretentious establishment I have ever been to. 10 of us there for a birthday ending with the birthday girl cussing out the staff.  Forcing us to order appz and mains because apparently it's a privilege to be there and we need to be forced to pay your bills. THEN taking over 2 hours to serve our mains....with a giggle and a surprised look on their face when we looked annoyed. Serving people around us who had arrived over an hour later. I only wish our whole party had walked out before we ate so we could stick you with the bill, and waste your table for over 2 hours. I will never ever EVER return here and I will tell everyone I know how horrible this experience was. It's one thing to be slow and off your game one night and it's another to be an a$$hole about it. Nothing comp'd...no sorry....nothing....just a snobby and I don't give a f*ck attitude throughout. Dude, there are plenty of places to eat and dance in this city....with a way better atmosphere and staff. Get ur sh*t together."}
{"text":"Neat place. I agree with other reviews regarding the setting; kind of like studio 54. Not sure why the food gets low reviews - it is pretty good. But this is a pricey place. I had the lamb chops for an appetizer; they were very tasty. I highly recommend those.

I will be honest; I mostly like this restaurant because of the waitresses. If you are a guy, you will find them very pleasing to the eye, and that is an understatement.  

I gave it 3 stars because, though the food is good, it is not worth the price. The waitresses, however, are worth every penny."}
{"text":"I don't understand what happened to this restaurant. Started with the Caprese salad. Large size with mediocre tomatoes bland, store bought burata that was very chilled. No flavor, no salt or balsamic little olive oil just mediocre ingredients. Had a seafood dish that's made me worry about about wow my body was going to react later.... Server was pleasant though the entire staff seems unsure of how to properly serve. I was told that the entire management had changed. While I regularly stay at the hotel across the street,Le Germaine, I won't be back"}
{"text":"This is a club, not a restaurant. Just like you should not expect great food in a beer pub, don't expect anything good here. If you want to party with 18yr old Arabic students, burning their parents cash, \"enjoy\" convenience-store-level pasta, and spend $300/bottle for bottle service with not enough staff then buona notte is for you."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been to buonanotte. It's been consistently bad. 

I'm going to rate this place solely from a restaurant perspective, because even though I've been here for the club portion and it was ok, I don't go to enough clubs in Toronto for a fair comparison. 

I do, however, know what good Italian food is and this place is overpriced garbage. 

Came with two other friends - they got the summerlicious menu and I just got a regular gnocchi. I tried everything. Comments:

- gnocchi was either over-kneaded or over-cooked or SOMETHING because it was so doughy and not chewy like it should be
- Bolognese sauce in the gnocchi was so bland! It literally tasted like tomato sauce from a can with some minced meat in it. Also the salt shaker wasn't working very well so it took me a long time to get it right 
- margarita pizza was bland also! I think the chef had a cold or something because he definitely did not taste-test anything that night. Dough was good, cheese was good. 
- tiramisu dessert was like 3 parts cream to 1 part cake. It was in a round cut out shape so clearly they made the whole thing in a pan and just punched out random circles for patrons. It's when a restaurant doesn't pay attention to things like this that you know they're just focused on the bottom line instead of serving quality food
- pannacotta was actually good. This is where the two stars come from. But since pannacotta is literally just heavy cream and gelatine, it doesn't say much

If you're thinking of coming here, walk two blocks and go to Gusto101 instead- they know Italian food."}
{"text":"I wish i could give the restaurant and dance club two different ratings, because my experiences were completely different. Ok to start of the restaurant, its a little cramped but has an great atmosphere. The waitresses are hands down some of the most beautiful women I've ever seen. I went here in the evening with 10 other friends to celebrate a bachelor party. We got there about 10 minutes past our reservation but were seated very quickly. Here's my biggest and only issue with this place. It took us over an hour and half from the time we were seat to the time our food got to our table. It got to the the point that i was so angry when my food came, i didn't even want to eat it. When our bill came I asked to speak to the manager about the poor service and he simply replied with \"what do you want me to do?\" I was literraly taken back by his response. The group next to us, came in after us and were being served dessert before we even got our meals, it was ridiculous. After dinner the staff moved the tables out the way and the restaurant turned into a night club. The night club was excellent, one of the best I've been to, but the service before hand still left a bad taste in my mouth. Overall i would give the club 4 stars."}
{"text":"Not what it used to be.  Not that the food was ever good, but at least there was a scene.  Now the ambiance falls flat, the waitresses have no smile, there is literally 30 people in the whole place.

The only good thing was the Italian meat-cutter that came to see us to offer us one very good platter of assorted cured meats.  That was the highlight of dinner.  I don't even want to talk more about the food, it's not worth my typing.

A big no on a place that used to be good at least to dance...  Now, even that is missing."}
{"text":"If your idea of a good time is having dinner in a club while 8.5s serve you mediocre food then this is the place for you. If you want to eat dinner at a place where the DJ makes more than the head chef these guys have got you covered. If you hate Italians and real Italian food stop by here. But what do I know, I only own three restaurants in New York City."}
{"text":"Filled with underage overcompensating rich kids pretending they are cool. Service is terrible, a group of my friends once paid cash and was accused of not paying and was forced to pay a second time. Food is overpriced and nothing special at all. There are plenty of amazing restaurants in Montreal and this is definitely not one of them."}
{"text":"With everyone's harsh reviews I prepared myself for the worst experience... I was pleasantly surprised! 

Nice ambiance and decor. 

Service was great. Food came out promptly with adequate timing between courses. Piping hot. Service was always friendly and they brought everything we asked for promptly. Table was consistently cleared timely. We even had a sommelier come by to help us choose our wines each time! At one point, I asked our server what kind of vegetable was in a dish to which she happily and knowledgeably recounted the ingredients, including the one in question: Jerusalem artichoke! I was impressed by her! 

Food was surprisingly good! 
1. Crispy calamari and shrimp to start, very fresh and light battered.
2. Meatballs were flavourful in a fresh tomato sauce. 
3. We has a baked eggplant dish with cheese and tomato sauce that was delish. 
4. Then a pasta dish with tomato sauce that was horribly bland! That was the only bad dish. Having 3 back to back tomato dishes wasn't the most exciting plan as well. However the last 3 dishes were wow! BOMB DIGGITY where it mattered most! 
5. Pizza with prosciutto and melted balls of delicious creamy rich cheese. And the crust was so tender and doughy yet crispy! 
6. Branzini crisp grilled on a buttery bed of kale mmmm. 
7. Striploin in a buttery jus with tender roast fingerling potatoes. The beef was grilled to perfection and amazingly juicy! 

All in all a great experience with good music afterwards. Perhaps my great experience was an amount (according to other reviews) but I still definitely wanted to show credit where it was due!"}
{"text":"I was at Buonanotte for a networking event, but luckily I had the opportunity to savour some of the lovely food they have on their regular menu, including the Caprese and their pizza!! 
It would be great to come back for a full meal, as I do love my Italian food. And the staff, if the event was any indication, is lovely. 
Bit on the pricey side, but I guess that's the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"This is definitely an experience. I'd give the overall experience a 3 out of 5 only because the food was so terrible and overpriced. 

Dance Club 5 out of 5... Food 1 out of 5.

We got two 90oz rib eye steaks that look like something out of The Flintstones. So you would think that would be a bachelor party's dream right? Nope...TERRIBLE steak...ruin our meal completely. The sides were expensive as crap and not anything special. Also, the service was terrible...they messed up our steaks and then didn't do anything to remedy the situation. Same thing happened with one of our bottles...they tried to screw us and give us a cheaper bottle when we ordered a bottle of crown...they ended up giving us some cheap Canadian crap.

As far as the club is concerned...amazing. One of the best club experiences I've had in a long time. We got bottle service and it made the night so much more fun. Great mix of music too...wish they played a little more hip hop...but it was still a great experience."}
{"text":"very disappointed with not only the service but the food as well. 

we had the last dinner seating for a group and were told we need to preorder the apps and dessert so that we weren't holding the table for too long... we sat down and the server told us there were no apps ready for us. so we had to order our own - this worked out well for some of us as we all didn't want apps. the server came around and said we HAD to order apps because everyone else was- that really upset me and a few other people as we're now wasting food. 

the birthday individual was happy for the free champagne she was given but the person pouring the glasses spilt it on me and the person sitting beside me. I felt that since it was the last dinner seating everything was rushed and cold. the pasta I got was tasteless I feel I get better tasting food at a chain like scaddabush. on top of that my pasta was colder than room temp. the dessert we got wasn't good either and we felt like they just wanted us out so they can get ready to switch over to a club. if you don't want people enjoying their food and each other's company than you shouldn't have late seating dinner. 

I was extremely disappointed with the service and food- I understand why they would do one bill for a group however the server still went around and took separate payments from everyone, why not just separate the bill to avoid problems of people looking at the bill to see what they owe.

I will not return here, nor will I recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I went to Buonanotte with a group of friends from school (Middlebury College in Vermont), it was a day trip and after having visited Montreal during the day, we ended up on the fun Boulevard Saint Laurent. This was many years ago, and I don't know if the food is still as amazing as it was then.

This is a fun, noisy, and vivacious restaurant, it's not the kind of place to have a romantic dinner for two, in which a docile conversation dominates the night. It's a place to eat great food, see beautiful people and have fun while enjoying a delicious meal. 

It's for anyone who wants to have fun regardless of age. My party was very excited because we were young then and looking to enjoy ourselves. We loved that all the servers did look like models, that made the atmosphere all the more fun. They were also very friendly, efficient, competent, and attentive. None of our needs were neglected, they were very cognizant of our needs and took the care to make us feel special despite the fact that our party was big, and the restaurant was packed with customers. 

Now, about my meal, I had a pasta dish with seafood that was so tasty that it enlivened every aspect of my eclectic and piquancy palate. I honestly haven't had Italian food as scrumptious as this since this beguiling evening. For dessert, I had the tiramisu with a cup of café au lait. The tiramisu was extraordinary, not packaged lady fingers soaked in weak coffee with barely any taste. This tiramisu had a cake that was made from scratch, just perfectly soaked in an espresso with just the right touch of liqueur, dusted with a fine coating of cocoa powder.  This was an enchanting evening for myself and my party.  One of my friends took pictures and I will see if she still has them so I may post them.

To top of this night, we saw Laurence Fishburne and his entourage eating at another restaurant on Boulevard Saint-Laurent. Such serendipity, an unforgettable night."}
{"text":"After a week of communicating with Stephanie at Buonanotte and reserving dinner and bottle service, upon arriving at the restaurant the very rude gentleman at the door said we weren't even on the reservation list. 
He impolitely told us to get in line and he wouldn't speak with us in regards to the situation. Getting into contact with the restaurant was a pain and to this day I haven't heard back. 
I don't think I'll be giving them my business any time soon."}
{"text":"Very Crowded VIP section, funny thing is, half of the people in the VIP section dont have a table on the VIP section, which makes it hard to even move. The Hip-Hop and R&B is the best ive heard yet. Definetly give it a go!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night for a friend's bday and the place was pretty busy!

Vibe here is more lounge-ish than restaurant-ish.  

The waitress for our table was excellent and quite attentive.  

I got the rhubarb lemonade and one of the pizzas with prosciutto on it....Bill ended up being just over $40.   Food was quite good, but it was kinda annoying having to eat the pizza with a fork and knife (they don't pre-slice it for you).  Also, the music was so loud that it was difficult to even hear the person beside you... we were screaming into each other's ear.  There were also only 3-4 stalls in the ladies room and waiting in line was a pain.  The crowd really started to pick up around 11pm and it has a generally more mature crowd.  I'm not sure I'd come back for either the food or the atmosphere....."}
{"text":"Don't bother. I agree with all the reviews here. I had to go to Buonanotte for dinner/club for a friend's birthday. I had no choice. Otherwise, this has the word skip all over it.

The only reason I'm giving this place two stars is because the staff was attentive. Other than that the food was extremely expensive and very stingy portions.
We were a party of 15 and our reservations were for 8:30 pm. Our table was ready but we didn't get seated until 9:15pm and didn't get served our food until 10:30 pm. That really killed the mood. The music was so loud. 

I had the following:

- glass of pino grigio
- plate of olives to start (the olives were nothing special but the oregano dressing was good)
- Raviolone (tiniest dish I have seen. It was literally two pieces of ravioli. It was more like an appetizer than a main)
- split a Margherita pizza with two other friends because we were still hungry

The pizza was soggy and burnt from the bottom. It took them less than 5 minutes to bring it out which tells me that the crust is precooked and they just throw the sauce and cheese on top and pop it in the oven. The flavours were there but the sogginess overpowered them.

I skipped dessert because I couldn't imagine eating anything else there. Even though I was still hungry!

We stayed when it turned into a \"club\" but the tables were still there (used for bottle service) and so there was no room to dance. It was horrible.I hated every minute of it.  If you want to dance and have a good time, don't go here. If you like to stand around, pay $15 for your rum and coke and people watch, this is your spot."}
{"text":"Not worth going on a Saturday night. The crowd of plastic-surgery-loving cougars and muscle-striving meatheads aren't worth pushing through for $16 drinks."}
{"text":"The place is good for a restaurant, the food is good but prices are a bit expensive. When the club mode takes effect, the places looks like a restaurant trying to be a club, kind of a strange look for the place but it seems to work for them. Not a large place to dance so the dance floor fills up pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Went for a girl's night out here.  It's a trendy popular dinner spot for downtown Toronto. Prices are fair/comparable and the portions are varied. The pasta was pretty small but tasty and the pizza was a good size for value.  We shared 4 dishes between us and all enjoyed the food. We ordered a bottle of wine and found we were neglected after that.  The service was a bit lack luster, but the waitress redeemed the place but offering us free shots.  She was actually really nice.  It didn't appear to be her fault, because the place was very busy and I over heard another waiter say they were way overbooked.  The management needs to be on top of this.  It has a nice ambiance, pretty waitresses, cool bar and great stone oven pizza. Apparently it turns into a nightclub at 12, maybe next time."}
{"text":"I signed on to yelp just to write this review.  In fact I am sitting here in the restaurant right now.  I'm not just trying to be a sour puss.  This is simply  a bad experience.  If you were guided to come here for a bachelor party dinner, then stop and turn around. Make a last minute change and get some good food and good service anywhere else. You will thank me for it. This place is full of douches."}
{"text":"Came here for my friend's bachelor party this past weekend. Got hosed on the price, was told one thing and when the bill came we were all in awe at the gross inflation. 

Thankfully the bachelor himself had a good time, but some of my dudes got the damn run-around when we tried to talk to management about the bill.

Food took a little while and I don't know that all of us even got to eat (which, in all fairness, was probably somewhat our fault because we're just so darn sociable).

Anyway, it was what it was. Beware the bill and iffy service, but enjoy your time nonetheless as the venue was otherwise decent."}
{"text":"I was here with my boyfriend for a bite to eat and some drinks, upon the recommendation of an owner following an interview for a position. I can see why they were interested in new management options, coming from an industry veteran and reading past Yelp reviews. Our meal at this establishment left a lot to be desired, and my partner and I agreed that had I not been interested at the time, we would have said something to management and left earlier in the evening. 

The hostess was lovely and kind, but we were sat at a large table for 4 right by the front door and it was a breezy, cold night to be by a door. Our server was polite enough table side, but it was not the level of service I would expect and we did not see her consistently throughout the evening, often sitting without drinks and with dirty items in front of us. 

We ordered a pizza and a bottle of red wine to share. The pizza came out within minutes of ordering because the place wasn't overly busy on a Thursday night. However the bottle of wine didn't come until we were almost done our pizza, we watched the bottle and glasses sit on the bar counter being ignored. The floor manager finally brought it over after he finished a conversation he was having the back galley with a group of servers and support staff gathered around him; there were way too many staff but unfortunately none were focused on delivering customer service. 

Some of the servers were leaning over the bar and were kicking their high heels off in between running drinks and going to tables. I wouldn't wear a pair of heels to work until I knew I could stand in them for hours because it looks unprofessional and like a chore to customers watching and waiting for items.

Our table overlooked the bar area, and we watched one of the bartenders put her finger over the nozzles on liquor bottles to count 1oz pours when she was making drinks. This type of practice is against health and safety policies because it introduces bacteria from her hands to the those drinks and to the remainder of the bottles that were touched.

Our bill amount was high because of the menu prices. There is nothing the matter with higher priced drink and menu items because this is the target market in the entertainment district - but it is my firm belief that the dining experience and customer service have to match these expectations, and this night unfortunately did not."}
{"text":"Honestly, the staff is unbelievably rude and will not go here again. After buying 5 rounds of six drinks, spending over $300 and tipping 10% each time, when I went to pay for the last round one of the drinks spilled. I finished paying and told the bartender and she said \"there's nothing I can do\"..Everyone was waiting for me to get my drink and were all wondering why the lady was being so rude after we just spent so much money. I explained the the lady I just bought 5 rounds and was asking just to top off one of them. The bartender said \"listen lady, you tipped me 10% each time I have to tip out 7% to the club, if you want the drink you have to buy another one\". I left and went somewhere else and will not be returning."}
{"text":"We ordered the 38 ounce steak... It was not even warm... Same with the mashed potatoes. The seafood pasta and scallops were overly salty. I would not return here for meals. Combine that and they forgot an order."}
{"text":"Beautiful resto on St Laurent.  It lets off a sophisticated vibe, dimmed lights, classy atmosphere, high end italian food......

Down to the one important facet of this place though, the servers, both male and female, are double-head-turning gorgeous. That day, the ladies wore skintight hot pink dresses, ooh la la! The guys, while not in skittish ensembles, could still definitely pass as an inspiration for a billboard ad. But what is more noticeable is that the service is impeccable. They're all really accommodating, and never fail to flash those veneered smiles. One of the bartenders (yes, also in that hot pink dress), who made a drink suggestion to my friend, offered to doll it up twice when it wasn't to friend's liking. 

I've been told that some hip hop big name chose to come here after a concert he did. I can't quite remember who, nor does that change my perspective of this place."}
{"text":"Been told this was a can't miss night spot for anyone going to Montreal for a quick trip.  Food was completely lacking flavor but the setup was very cool, and if you have to spend $25 on dinner to skip the lines and have a table, it's pretty worth it.  The bottle service was priced about right, and the only girls I saw all weekend who were better looking than the clientele here were the waitresses...all stunning.  Not a great place to meet people as it was very loud and people come in groups...but you can still make it work."}
{"text":"Good food, I think. I don't honestly remember. Empires rose and fell in the time it took us to order and receive our meal. I have lost so many memories. My childhood is an indistinct flicker in the caverns of my mind. I forget my name for minutes at a time each day. Time passes inexorably. As I march toward my grave, my one regret in life is ever having eaten at Buonna Notte."}
{"text":"Where else can you go where you find food, alcohol, club, and girls (of all ages.  Ay, its Canada Ay).  And through it all, while you're dining and drinking, the surrounding environment can easily just transform into a club, like that.  

Of course, its no place to take a date to, or to play catchup with a friend, or I wouldn't come here if I was just trying tourist my way through town, cause that's just silly.  This place has celebration, party, and ruckus spelled out all across.  It was the perfect setting for a bachelor's party.

For a party of 15 gentlemen, we found ourselves among the other 70% of the crowd of bachelor/bachelorette parties taking advantage of Montreal and all its glory on St Laurent.  The place serves up Italian cuisine, which I guess is the easiest way to make something affordable, yet come out looking gourmet.  The food was ok.  We had it planned out with a pre fixed menu so nothing was out of the ordinary- we had the usual calamari, skirt steak, bufala cheese on regular salad with tomatoes, and some other meats and pasta to go about.  Bottomline is you'll be pleasantly full, but since you're there to party, don't expect too much.  Plus, the dj plays some nice classic 90s hit during dinner, enough to get the crowd (well...us really) to start jumping on our chairs and singing in the middle of the restaurant.  Yes, we were those guys. 

As the club scene started to mature and the table in front of us slid on over to clear out the area, we opted to stay by purchasing a few bottles at about $200 per to get us through part of the night.  

The service was great and the servers were fun.  Definitely a go to supperclub for celebrations."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on Feb 1, 2013 - I am going to write this while I still remember what I can...before I crash. 

Just like the original in MTL - really happening, hope it stays that way.

Good location. The inside is ultra trendy.

The drinks were great - you're looking at $16 a cocktail, so about normal for a decent spot, and the only vodkas they carry are kettle one - grey goose - chopin I think.

The food was good not great. I mean don't order the pizza it is dry and I will chalk it up to a bad suggestion by the server, but DO try the fried eggplant with cheese. 
Service was great, always someone coming by refilling, folding, replacing, there were like 3 tiers of teams.

At 12 AM, it turns into a \"club\" - people try too hard though, dancing on tables and seats, but the only time in regular club life you have to do that is when it is so crowded - there is no sense in dancing on tables when the whole venue is only 25% full - those are just my cynical views.

The crowd is trendy, good looking but I felt that, by no fault of the venue - a fair percentage of the crowd are older cougar-esque women who are looking for sugar daddy's. Other than that everyone is very service oriented. 

I would go here again, with hopes the novelty does not wear off. It is a pre-spot. So , eat dinner, get drinks, and then go somewhere else if you are looking for dancing and craziness."}
{"text":"The meatballs were excellent, but the service and overall experience were so far below-par that I can't bring myself to give this establishment more than one star.

After enjoying their experience at the sister Buonanotte in Montreal, my friends had booked a large party of 12 to come by a few weeks after the restaurant's grand opening.

We know that things can be cumbersome when a new business is settling so we tried our best to make it easy for them, booking two months in advance and calling a few days prior to remind them we were coming.

Unfortunately, it seemed that they forgot about us and all the large tables were already taken. Management did not attempt to make the situation right, they did not apologize, they actually found a way to make matters worse: after making us wait for \"just a few\" (aka 45) minutes, they sat us at three separate tables.

Although the tables were not heavy and could easily be moved, they told us it was against their policy to displace the tables at that time in the evening.

We began dinner at three tables that were not adjoined and, because there was such a delay, the restaurant began turning into a nightclub while we were still eating. All the tables were moved against the walls (except ours) and people began dancing all around us. We quickly finished our food, paid and exorbitant bill and left.

The worst part? The stuck-up, conceited and immodest demeanor as well as the stark lack of apology from the manager (and any of the staff).

I will advocate against this establishment fervently any time I hear its name uttered."}
{"text":"Had a number of dishes here and liked them all. Their 24 month aged prosciutto is very good. had it on their Prosciutto, Rucola E Pomodorini pizza. Charcuterie board was yummy. I really enjoyed the seared scallops - large, juicy and cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"I've never been more thoroughly unimpressed with the quality of food. To add insult to injury, the service from the staff was absolutely abysmal. It was so bad we thought we were on a hidden camera show. I waited two hours for some meatless spaghetti; and I'm not embellishing when I say this, Spaghetti-Os from a can have more flavor. Food was beyond bland...just disrespectful. This restaurant is a complete insult to my palate and time. In the name of everything you may hold dear and sacred to your heart, ignore the eye candy that works here and DO NOT SET FOOT INSIDE THIS ESTABLISHMENT."}
{"text":"Did not know ahead of time that this was a club offering Italian food. Service was adequate, by waitresses dressed in sexy uniforms (Italian Hooters?).  Food explanations were not easy to understand.  The waitress told us to try the charcuterie (house special). It was enough to serve 8 people. Unfortunately it was just my wife and I. We wrapped most of it to go. She then asked us if we wanted dessert. We said we would like entrees. Veal was decent and the turbot was good. There were 3 bachelorette tables and one bachelor parties (quite unusual for a Sunday night).  If you like very loud energetic clubs that serves average food, then this is for you. Dinner for two including two glasses of chianti and a $68 bottle of wine was $284 with gratuity."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to try this restaurant and suggested it to my friend as a pre-theatre dinner spot. 

The restaurant has a very modern, beautiful interior and is quite spacious. The hostess and servers are very attractive people who are very friendly and talkative. We were served with complimentary faccacia bread, which was tasty. 

I had the prosciutto rucola e pomodorini, which came with arugula and tomatoes. The server had mentioned that the restaurant made the best pizza in Toronto, but I beg to differ. While it was certainly flavourful, I have had better pizza. Also, I had requested that the pizza be sliced prior to it being served, and was told that was unacceptable. I insisted as I wanted to share it with my friend, so the chef reluctantly did so. I do think that the customer is always right and reasonable requests should be accommodated."}
{"text":"Cannot split the bill. Charge extra service fee without informing you. And arrogant waitress. Just avoid this restaurant."}
{"text":"The staff is not only beautiful but gracious in service. Our service for dinner was delightful. The experience was marked to perfection by the manager that saved us bar seats in transition from the table. The service at the bar was very attentive. Elle was fabulous!"}
{"text":"Just popped in for lunch. Having tried most of the restaurants in the area, it was nice to find a spot I hadn't tried.

Started with the tomato and mozzarella ball insalata. There is a generous portion of mozzarella. It's a light sauce and the fresh basil really makes the difference. I find that buonanotte likes to keep its flavours authentic and doesn't use heavy sauces. This is great because they do use fresh ingredients but I find that some dishes really miss the mark in terms of complexity.

For my main I had the prosciutto arugula pizza. The crust had a pita bread feel. A little more burnt than crispy for me. And as a general hint, they don't cut their pizzas to avoid the flavours from running under the pizza. I found that it was ok and quite light as pizzas go but again, didn't get the complexity that layering flavours would get.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"If you are in Montreal, this place is the place to be seen.  Food is great  and the atmosphere just rocks!"}
{"text":"This review is for the food, not the club. 

After reading the previous reviews, I was terrified that this dinner was going to be positively awful. But I was invited as a guest, so I was prepared to grin and bear it. 

However...

The wine was wonderful. And the family style dinner was surprisingly good. 

The appetizers of burrata cheese, steak tartare, and octopus were all flavorful. The burrata was the best. 

The pasta was a clam dish. Al dente and some sort of linguine. Very good. A little spicy. 

And the main entree was lamb chops and filet. Both were good, but not the highlight of the meal. The mashed potatoes though were a really nice side. 

For dessert, a warm fig cake. A nice ending to a pleasant meal. 

We were done before the restaurant turned into a club, so again - dinner review only."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, high prices.

Don't come here unless you care more about showing than anything else. And even in that case, go somewhere that's actually classy with good food, i.e. Queue de Cheval"}
{"text":"It's a nice place and I would definitely go there for dinner again.  It's not a place that I really want to hang around the bar though.  The bar area is very small and it's difficult to even get a drink because people are 3 or 4 deep.  They should take out the bar stools as the night progresses."}
{"text":"While in Montreal for my Birthday, my husband found this spot and took me there. It was recommended that we get there before 11 when he booked the table. We arrived as the supper club was transitioning from a dinner spot, to a night club. The decor was nice, bathrooms clean, server friendly, patrons happy and fun. Most of the people were close to age 30. the music was a good mix of mostly 90s music. 

This spot was a great find and a lot of fun! I highly recommend trying them out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of college friends. We sat for 2 hours with getting nothing more than a few glasses of water and a bowl of bread. After complaining to the manager they gave us free watered down shots of vodka. Then proceeded to take much longer for our food. So we left, some stayed back to wait for the food which I heard was terrible. Probably all pre made."}
{"text":"Very confusing setup last Friday evening. We had been invited by a jeans brand after Toronto Fashion Week and were looking forward to their party at Buonanotte.

It was a very weird mix of people sitting at tables, eating dinner and various other very drunk people mashing into you to get to the one bar on the other side of the venue. Nearly impossible to order a drink in that manner so we decided to try to get a table to enjoy ourselves.

We asked the waiter to get us a table if possible as we wanted to order some food however he said at that point we would have to buy a bottle (!) to have a seat. We did ask if we could order wine, which was going to be ok with us, he said yes but returned with just a food menu, not a wine list. My boyfriend asked him again if we would be getting a table but he seemed to busy to have a time estimate.

After ten awkward minutes of standing in the middle of the restaurant/dance floor in front of the DJ we left, went elsewhere and had a much better time. 

Its too bad too as the food on their website looks amazing and we might have had a great time if the situation was handled a bit differently."}
{"text":"Hideous establishment of pompus morons who spend ridiculous amounts of money on reserving a table, in a crowded snobby locale that takes an hour of waiting in the snow to get into (unless you bribe the obnoxious bouncers) just so you can watch people snorting coke while you try to pee.  Who would want to go to this place for dinner?  Pathetic."}
{"text":"this place is pretty nice but expensive for italian food.  after dinner, this place becomes a bar/club, and it's pretty hopping (but VERY cheesy)."}
{"text":"If I could give it less stars I would. Brunch on a Sunday is a set menu of literally five options, a starter, main and \"dessert\". Smoked salmon is three burnt crackers, minuscule pieces of salmon and micro greens. Caprese salad for main is horrible, full of oil and again greens instead of other ingredients. Burger for main had no taste, we asked for hot sauce. Service is extremely slow and one person didn't even get one of her courses. Brunch took about two hours and we didn't even get dessert because we had evening plans and had to leave.  I called it a diet brunch. I have had better meals at ikea. People dress very nicely for brunch here, high heels, clubbing dresses etc. Music was so loud we were yelling across the table to have a conversation. Go to Copacabana which is very close instead!!! Amazing brunch there, this place is horrible."}
{"text":"Buonanotte is an upscale Italian restaurant by day and bar lounge by night.  Located on Mercer street beside MAISON, this venue somewhat reminds me of Thompson HOtel.  Great looking crowd, beautiful ambiance, decor, etc, it somehow gives off a pretentious vibe.  
In terms of drinks, I had their Amaretto Sour with Egg whites, and till this day I feel Thompson hOtel makes it better.  Prices for drinks are reasonable (FOR THE AREA) so be sure to pay slightly more than your average drink.  The choice in music varies as the dj accommodates its patrons with different genres. 
The overall experience was OKAY, however I've heard from many the food is neither here- nor- there. so i guess ill need to make a second visit."}
{"text":"Restaurant? You mean they serve food at that place?? 
Well i guess you learn something new every day!! 
I see lots of bad comments but i had a blast when i went! The place was on fire!! Music was amazing! Whoever was spinning that night (Fridays) did a very good job! 
The place is spacious with lots of room to go crazy!
Love it !!!"}
{"text":"Um... Hate leaving nasty reviews... If you know me, I'm the kind of person who finds positives in anything and everything. 
But this place... Haha just can't help but laugh at how beyond horrible the service was. 
I've been to the Montreal location and thought it would be same light happy atmosphere with awesome service to match the delicious food... But no. 
We called in advance to make dinner reservations for 8 people for 9.30pm on a Friday to start off my best friends bachelorette night. When we all ordered drinks and food (two pizzas, two appetizers and a main to share) we were told by the waitress that we need to each order a main in order to \"keep your table\" which somehow wasn't mentioned on the phone when we were making reservations. When I said that not everyone of us was that hungry she called the manager. I told the manager that we will compensate with drinks but he said that in that case we need to get two bottles of liquor minimum. Basically we all ended up ordering food that noone ate just to keep the table and not to have the drama. When we did, we waited forever for it (And it arrived cold). I've been living dining and partying in Toronto and other big cities for at least 10 years. This is the first time I've had such a horrible experience. Wanted to stay and party but couldn't justify leaving more cash for these inconsiderate and disrespectful people."}
{"text":"Came here for F1 weekend. Amazing place. Very clean. Very exclusive. Quality food, incredibly attractive people go here. My friends and I had dinner and drinks amongst some professional athletes. 
Dont even plan on getting in unless you are buying bottles though."}
{"text":"This place is so surreal that it should probably get something like eleventy negative pi stars, because trying to encapsulate the experience in virtual starblocks and sans serif type feels like a stunning disservice. The closest experience I've had to this was clubbing in Istanbul (Reina and Anjelique), an adventure more abstract expressionist than purely Dali.

Here's the deal with Buona Notte. Their management clearly has ties with many a group event service (like the one we employed), because there's no way that anyone is willingly deciding to make a reservation here based solely on the online reviews. That results in a ton of group parties--bachelor, bachelorette, and birthday parties abounded during our few hour experience here--made up of young, mostly good-looking people. Given the certainty of people thinking of Montreal as a party destination, it's not a bad business bet.

Buona Notte compensates by providing not-altogether-terrible-but-by-no-means-good food, some insanely gorgeous waitresses, and copious amounts of alcohol. At 11, the busboys start moving tables to the side, the DJ drops the bass, and you can oomph-ooomph-oomph to your heart's content all through the night.

How this place came to be is a mystery wrapped in an enigma, and I simultaneously can't imagine ever wanting to step foot in here again but all the while appreciating the absurdist act that I did. I guess it's the Schroedinger's cat of establishments, Montreal's modern-day version of the Gem Saloon."}
{"text":"Easily the worst, most laughable \"club\" experience I've ever had.

When you book a table I'm not sure why they tell you to arrive in a very small window of time, only to have no idea when your table will actually be ready. Oh and be prepared to be treated like crap by the doofus doormen, who clearly feel super powerful holding a one sheet print out of that night's list (side note: maybe invest in some clipboards for these guys?).

Once inside the disappointment continued and even escalated which I didn't think was possible. The table we reserved was hysterical - no chairs/seating whatsoever and the table itself goes up to about mid-thigh so you're just awkwardly standing around it in a sea of similarly awkward groups standing around their tiny dining tables. Whoever said it felt like a cheesy VFW hall with a disco ball was spot on.

In the end we were so over the horrible service we left before actually ordering anything, unable to stomach spending any money there. Le Rouge and Flyjin offer a 1000000000000x better experience and actually treat you like paying customers."}
{"text":"I experienced Summerlicious with a group of friends. I've been here 2x before, both times for networking events, so I truthfully, had little to give it an objective review. I still feel I have I lack the ability to give it an objective review, but will attempt so. 

The drinks are overpriced; the cocktails unoriginal; and the wait staff is dressed in skimpy tight clothing and their skills not commensurate with the needs of a restaurant.

The food itself was a bit of a surprise. I did enjoy my arancini, braised octupus pasta and tiramisu Summerlicious dinner. I am conflicted in giving this review. This is not my type of venue."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, very professional and high class service. Cuisine is very slow, waited more than 1.5 hours for a plate. The salmon tasted very good. Great ambiance, great people. 
Recommended for a dinner and party after."}
{"text":"Worst place ever - bartender Abby is so rude to women. Don't bother wasting your time here.  The drinks were ridiculously weak and the glasses were barely rinsed -- unsanitary!"}
{"text":"I was at Buonanotte for an event and I had a very negative experience with their bartender! 

She was super rude not only to me personally but also to my husband and a couple of my friends! First she didn't have change, ok I get it! it was early on in the evening and I had a large bill so I was cool with the fact that she didn't have change... BUT tell me that I'm waiting for change instead of ignoring me while you serve 3 other people!!! 

Secondly 2 girls who clearly were new in Canada and don't speak English, they asked for cocktails she said \"they are behind me\" they said \"do you have a menu!\" She says rudely \"yes behind me\" pointing at the bar!! so I got involved and asked the girls you want a sweet drink? They said yes yes .. I said what alcohol they responded Malibu so I told the bartender that.. instead of smiling or fucking saying thank you she just goes ahead with her business.. anyways husband ordered a pizza and my friend a pasta dish and came back to the table also saying that she's super rude! 

I'm just trying to say that your role is 30% making drinks and 70% costumer service .. you will burn in costumer service hell!"}
{"text":"This resto is not known for its food or the service. The food is mediocre but you're really paying for dinner to avoid waiting in line when it turns into a supper club. So for the price, you can get better quality food up the street. The resto is spacious and has a nice lounge atmosphere. I love it best for drinks in the summer when all the windows are open and there's a terrasse."}
{"text":"Ok well I haven't been out with the girls in sometime. My friend chose this place for her birthday price fixed menu served family style. Apps - calamari, pizza and salad. Calamari was excellent, pizza was ok and the salad I make the same at home. Main chicken with potatoes and zucchini and salmon with bok choy. Both were ok although the piece of chicken I took was not cooked through. Dessert - panna cotta - was good until the bottom there was a layer of gelatin that was not mixed properly. Prosecco was a nice touch but I saw what they picked and it's about a $12 bottle at the LCBO so it's not like they splurge on it. 

There was 8 of us bill came to over $600 - with maybe 4-5 bottles of water. Someone spent $80 on a bottle of wine. On the phone my friend was told we could stay at the table after dinner for the club portion of their night. Lo and behold we were rushed through dinner and told we could stay but would have to stand at the bar that our table was booked for others at 9:30 (our reservation was for 7:30). 
 
Thankfully one of our party was able to convince someone we needed a table. So we did get one. Ordered drinks there - took forever. One ordered a Cosmo - worst one ever. Bathrooms were a mess and need to be fixed in a place charging that much for dinner and drinks...I would expect more than a sliding bolt to lock the broken original locks. Not sure why they have an attendant - she just stood there all night looking miserable. What really made my night was looking at the $4000 bottle of wine...really?!?! Not in this place. Not ever. The bar stools vinyl was rubbing off, the place looks ok under the nightclub lights but full lighting...you see where the deficiencies are. Staff who greet you and look you up and down when you walk in...really?! You all have nothing to be snotty about - your resto/lounge isn't all that great!  It was disappointing and a reminder of why going downtown to the 'cool' places are not something I do anymore. Too much money and not enough that you get with it. Sorry guys - I'll stick to my small east end places with cheap good quality food, craft beer and live music. I guess my club girl is gone in favour of being surrounded by real people instead of the lipstick and heels crowd. Not coming back. Maybe the one in Montreal is better."}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious for the menu seemed decent. The restaurant had like 15 people, tops.

The drinks were not made properly, the food was so so. The service was poor from clueless waitress to unresponsive bus boys. 

I know it's a popular (and pretentious) place on the weekend with a late night crowd, but not worth coming for the food. They put the name to shame since it's from Montreal. Not sure how it can stay in business this long."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner as it walking distance from my hotel. Was hungry and ordered the bruschetta and some pasta. The bruschetta was on toasted wheat bread? The pasta was good. The waitresses were no doubt pure eye candy, but took them 45 minutes to give me my bill. I asked three times...I was very irritated after being on a long flight."}
{"text":"When friends told me this place was a \"supperclub\" I didn't get it until I experienced it myself. The transition from restaurant to club was so fast and seamless that I didn't realized it happened. Definitely would return."}
{"text":"Great place they have a great group steak would have been better if music was more uplifting during dinner. Cocktails are not bad."}
{"text":"$18 for $5 worth of mediocre calamari in a nasty mayo sauce with hot sauce.  $28 for boxed rigatoni with some prego and beef cheek (they said it was veal) ...this was seriously something you'd get at a convenience store for $8.  and to top it all off... $9 (NINE) (IX) for a single bottle of tap water ..the ones you get for $1 (she poured it for us every so often - really annoying)  this place was really trashy.   all said, we paid $62 for $15 dollars worth of unappetizing or filling food.   robbing people on the prices does not make your establishment classy.  it makes you thieves.

oh yeah, the waitresses didn't like our shitty tip so she apparently added another 6 bucks on ...more robbery"}
{"text":"Well -- we checked out Buonanotte last night... Here's the lowdown ---

The good:
- great atmosphere, modern decor
- attentive staff 
- friendly 

The food:
- It was ok -- I have had better
- we shared the bruschetta and the fritto misto (fried calamari and shrimp)
- my friend had the pizza (which I must say did look good)
- I had the special risotto of the day with asparagus and crab (supposedly) I say this because I could not taste or discern much of the crab in the dish -- the risotto was a nice consistency though
- we ended up with the chocolate bomboloni's - and one of the donuts did not have any chocolate filling -- doh!!!

The not so great:
- we asked for a booth - and the waitress said she did not have any available and that all were reserved within the hour -- really??!!  When we left about 2 hours later, there were so many booths available -- so didn't think this was very nice actually -- and the place was not hopping
- the size of the wine offering -- wow!  I never never seen so little in such a big glass, and all glasses were north of $10 each -- so not inexpensive.  Even the bar at the Ritz gives you more for the money.

So - it was ok -- and I might go back -- but then again -- I might not."}
{"text":"Food -  3 Stars
Service - 1 Star
Facility - 1 Stars
Atmosphere - 2 Stars

If you are female and hoping to book a fun ladies night out - go somewhere else. We booked into Buonanotte with a large group for a bachelorette party, having a set dinner menu and bottle service to follow. 

We were seated immediately and the food service was good, but the drink service (during dinner) was horrible. Our server came by only twice in the 2.5 hours and she was completely disinterested in serving our group - missing orders, not making eye contact or engaging us at all. (Interestingly, she did seem much more attentive with the two bachelor parties surrounding us though, a theme that seemed to carry on throughout the evening.)   

The women's washroom was DISGUSTING. Even as early as 8:30 pm there was no toilet paper or hand towels, which never got restocked.  The condition of the bathroom was run down - broken stall doors, only one working sink, garbage everywhere. I was surprised to hear a guy complain to my friend that he disliked the washroom attendant in the men's as he didn't want to tip him every time he went in - I would've gladly tipped an attendant if there was one in the women's, maybe then I wouldn't have to use bar napkins as toilet paper!

As soon as we finished dinner, we were abruptly told by the porters that we needed to vacate the table as they were switching it over to \"bar\" tables.  Our group was forced to stand and look for a place to move to. When we inquired about the post-dinner bottle service, we were told that we would have to find a different spot ourselves if there was one available - they didn't reserve one for us even though we requested it. No accommodations were made for the bottle service that we requested, and yet it seemed that every group of males that were in the restaurant had been. 

From that point on we were ignored by the staff and management, and we felt  like we were on display, left standing in the middle of the room surrounded by men who hadn't been displaced from their seats. Considering that we just spent over $2,000 on dinner, you think that they would've treated us better...NOPE. 

We tried to make the best of the situation for the bride, we danced, waited in line at the bar to get drinks (which was an experience, as all the bartenders were female and they were focused on serving the men before women).  A very nice group of guys approached us and offered to share their seating and bottle service with us, which was great, but it was overwhelmingly apparent that this place caters to men As a group of women, the only attention we received was from the male patrons, which was extremely disappointing as we would've spent a lot more money and time there, but we ended up leaving early and going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Although the music choices were better at this club it would only last 20 seconds like someone else mentioned. The \"dj\" just likes to skip very quickly through songs. 
Although the waitress is good looking I felt like she preyed on us and brought out a champagne bottle that no on in our group would've ordered. To top it off management was useless in rectifying the situation."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The whole supper club thing needs to became more prevalent everywhere asap. We started off with a large feast which slowly turned into a raging party. Good food, amazing music, great decor. Would 100% go back when going back to Montreal."}
{"text":"Sadly, this place is not what I remember it to be :(

I made a reservation here two weeks in advance for a Saturday night for 8 people and could only get 7pm, which is really frustrating because there are two very distinct and consistently upheld seatings - 7pm and 9:30pm. I knew, no matter what we tried, that we'd be kicked off the table and forced to awkwardly stand at the bar until the place turns into a club.

Besides that, a few positives:
- Service: Our waitress was very attentive and patient. We asked a million questions about the menu and took a while to get organized and order. One of the orders was wrong when she brought it out, so a new plate plus complimentary side vegetables promptly arrived.
- Dessert: We got all of the desserts and shared. Literally, every single one was incredible and a must-have. In addition to the ones we ordered, we also got a complimentary tiramisu for the engagement of one of my friends. Awesome.
- Shots: We were kicked off the table around 10pm (nice grace period) but offered a round of shots at the bar to make up for it - nice touch.

The negatives, however, really left their impression:
- Food: I was not impressed - and especially so given the price. The fish and meat dishes were small, overly salty and sparse with sides/carbs (even when included in the dish). The chicken was ok, the seafood special and other white fish were really bland. The pasta was plentiful but tasted and looked like the sauce came out of a can. Our appetizers were ok - salmon tartare was probably the best bet.
- Atmosphere: the place used to attract an attractive, fun and energetic group of Montreal locals - people you wanted to be around. It now appears to cater more to tourists (especially younger Americans coming to experience all Montreal has to offer that demographic - need I say more?). It makes for a rather uncomfortable experience for 8 girls who are really just looking for a fun night out together.
- Bottle service / club switch-over: This was really poorly done - most of the tables remained in the same locations, chairs were scattered in the aisles, waitresses couldn't get by and neither could we! the music didn't encourage dancing and there was a general apathy in the place. Sad. 

Save your appetite for La Belle Province post-bar and just come here for bottle service OR come in the late seating and have some apps and dessert and then continue the night at the bar."}
{"text":"Very nice place for a date dinner or go out with friends, I had pizza there which was very yummy, probably one of my top fav pizzas in Toronto, however the pizza was served barely warm... Too bad. Service is not the quickest but it is worth the 4 stars for the decor and coat service."}
{"text":"This place is getting a star only because I have to give it one.  I think the only selling point is girls in short skirts and low tops.  This didn't work out for me because I came here to eat."}
{"text":"The Saint Laurent street corridor has a host of restaurants of all types, particularly clustered around the Complexe Ex-Centris shopping mall. 

Most of the restaurants have a polished feel, nearly all with candle lights on every table in a darkened setting, in contemporary designs and decent service. 

Buona Notte (Good Evening/Night in Italian) is right in the thick of this, across the street from the Complexe. It has a variety of Italian dishes, with antipasta dishes priced in the teens (CAD) and various pastas priced in the 20's. 

There are about 5 or 10 Italian restaurants in this section of town within a couple of blocks, and this one is moderately priced, contemporary but casually decorated, and a decent choice.

{"text":"First the good - food and service was pretty good especially with a large group of people, we had 17.  They set up a pre-order menu for us including some vegetarian dishes since we had a few with us.

The pre-fixed menu included apps, main course and dessert for the group.  The apps we're tasty especially the meatballs.  The main dish for the vegetarians were penne in a red sauce.  The main for the others were thick pork chops.

The bad - it was noisy and loud with music and another large group celebrating.  One of their people came over and attempted to shut us up while the rest of the restaurant and bar just was equally as loud.

Remember, we had a pre-fixed menu so the manager asked if we would like to upgrade paying a little more to get meat.  I agreed thinking, ok, steaks or at least beef.  No, it was the pork chops.  Still.not bad even though it was \"an upgrade\".  

To continue, we never got any desserts as per the pre-fixed menu.  Still the staff was attentive and the food was not bad though the pasta dish was served to non vegetarians cold.

I would have given them a better rating if there wasn't so much noise or at least serve the dessert as per the pre-fixed menu.

I will not go back as it is just not my kind of place as well as the fact that they up sold us and didn't deliver the dessert."}
{"text":"Really bad bad service across the board.

1. We made reservations for 10 people. When the first 4 people got there they made them wait for 20 minutes in the front, until the \"majority arrives\". At this point I already wanted to go some place else. I stayed because it was my friend's birthday.

2. So when the majority arrived we got our table. The waitress took so long to even get our drinks it was painful. We waited there for like 20 minutes until she finally came back.

3. Finally we start placing our order for drinks and food. I was told I could not add absolutely anything to my pizza because the cook didnt like that...I could only remove items just not add any, I wasnt even offered the option to pay for it, it was all \"SORRY YOU CANT ADD NOTHING\". All i really wanted was some prosciutto, well ya, not allowed. 

4. So with my food I ordered a beer, I got the beer bottle fairly quickly then the waitress disappeared for like 40 minutes. So we are still waiting for our food with empty beer bottles and with no one around for the second round.

5. So It took over 1 hour for our mains to arrive. It was an insane wait. The servers came with the dishes putting them in front of each one of us and im like impressed that they even know what belongs to who, except that they didnt. They didnt pair a single plate with the right person, they might have just asked instead of placing plates in front of people for no apparent reason.

6. As expected it took another hour to get our desserts.

7. After waiting for hours in the slowest service ever, we finally get our bill...OH forget about split bills, all 10 of us had to figure out who got what in the loudest and darkest setup ever.

8. All this time I felt extremely safe since i had a bouncer standing right behind my table checking out every waitress passing by.

9. Right after we paid, we were told by the \"Manager\" to  get a bottle or else leave because our table was gonna be used for bottle service. That was just amazing, lol. Well if they didnt take 4 hours just to attend one table MAYBE we would have fucked off a lot sooner. 

Anyways, please avoid"}
{"text":"Bland food, disorganized staff, cluttered and ineffective layout, long wait at the bar, oh and see-thru doors in the washroom - what!!! All this goodness for exaggerated price tag. At least save yourself the frustration and go somewhere where they'll will provide you quality service, if you decide to spent some money.
PS had my full new drink taken away from the table while I was in the restroom."}
{"text":"I went here on a Saturday night for a birthday. The party I was with (the people) were great and I had a good time with them but the place itself was sort of a disaster. First, they can't decide what they are - restaurant, lounge or club and it's weird
During dinner, the music was blasting - making it almost impossible to talk to people at the table (not sure why the music is so loud since noone is dancing during dinner - there isn't any space) then around 11:30, it turns into a club - you know this because the music becomes much louder and they start getting rid of chairs, but not tables, so you get to dance around the tables, which they keep for bottle service (this is very weird to me) and they just start letting in tons of people... All to dance around tables... They also don't do a great job with the bottle service - there were no lemon or line wedges, after the place turned into a \"club\", our waitress/ shot girl was nowhere to be found and we ran out of glasses. Also, she would take away half finished drinks - great way to make everyone drink more and waste more alcohol! 
The doors to the women's stalls are also a bit transparent so you can see the person in there which is super weird - can they not afford opaque doors?
The food was not good - soggy pizza, it took almost 2 hours to get entrees (they had some big parties and were running low on food or something) - when the food came, the portions were tiny and uneven - 1 guy got half a shrimp with his salmon, I got 2 mini potatoes cut in half with my steak and 1 piece of a leek, another person got asparagus with her steak (no one else did)... Clearly the kitchen doesn't really know what they are doing 
They're just trying to offer everything and are failing at it - wanna be a club? Be a club! Wanna be a restaurant? Get some chefs and be a restaurant! Wanna be a lounge? You can do it buonanotte!"}
{"text":"Came here for a girls dinner over the weekend. Atmopshere and service was great! Food is ok."}
{"text":"I'm from NYC and North Jersey, and let me tell you, I've had some damn good homemade and restaurant Italian Food.  Let me say I love Montreal and one of the reasons why is because of my experience at this restaurant.  The food, to be honest is average, but the overall atmosphere of this super club, is to die for.  Near the entrance there are plates signed by A list celebrities from all over the globe. The waitresses looked outstanding and the other people there were so fun.  It's exactly what a super club is suppose to be, friendly atmosphere, a good dinning experience, followed by drinking and partying.  I think we spend about 80 dollars each, but completely worth it considering we stayed there to party too. Drinks had plenty of alcohol. =)"}
{"text":"Every time I am in Montreal, I go to Buono Notte.  The walk up Saint Laurent (vacant lots, empty buildings) leaves something to be deisered, but once you get to the top of the hill, there is a cluster of hip restaurants and shops.  Buono Notte has a sleek, dimly lit interior, very nice.  The food is fantastic and the wine is great too.  The service was great as well. If you are ever in Montreal, I do recommend it!"}
{"text":"The four of us dined there around 7 pm. The  wait staff (primarily women) wore tight fitting little black cocktail dresses, which initially took me off guard until we learned the venue turned into a Club later at night, then it made sense. We opted to sit outside and got seated promptly. The manager stopped off at our table to welcome us. Outside worked better for us as it was quieter and a beautiful summer evening. Inside they had Club music playing, which could still be heard from where we were sitting, but it was more palatable. We started out with the insalata di casa and, muffuletta, which were nice starters along side the house focaccia bread for the table. Two of us had the Margherita pizza's, one had the Piadina (arugula, prosciutto, cheese rolled up in a pizza crust log then sliced vertically)  and spaghetti with bolognese sauce (the restaurant readily substituted the gnocchi for spaghetti when requested to do so). The Margherita pizza had a nice thin crust that was crispy in the center of the pizza and chewy on the outside. The flavors were well balance with fresh mozzarella, fresh basil and tomato sauce. It is one of my go to pizzas that helps me gauge the quality of the food at the restaurant and it definitely measured up. As a side note we had great water service in a place where they are more akin to serving alcohol, which we appreciated as 3 of 4 of us were only drinking water for our beverages. One of us had a glass of red wine. All in all a relatively pleasant, tasty dinner. The pre tax/pre tip bill was $108, so in my mind reasonable for what we got (I live in California-home of Google) plus we took some leftover pizza back with us. The only downside was the server was slow to close out our bill as she got distracted by a few neighboring patrons, but we weren't in a hurry so it wasn't a big deal."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

Not sure if this is run by the same people who run Time Supper Club. But the experience here is only aight. Food was ok and the party scene was also ok. Didn't draw the chic, trendy crowd that Time draws but we had a blast."}
{"text":"This is club service food with pretty faces so if you accept it for it is - you can have a good time."}
{"text":"The supper club experience at Buonanotte is a pretty ingenious one-stop nightlife affair. Everything you need, from dining and dancing to beats and bottle service, is all provided to you and your crew at a cleverly paced agenda, all within the confines of a singular, uber-trendy establishment. It's pretty much the opposite of bar-hopping - instead of the patrons moving around to get a change of scenery with one booze joint to the next, a supper club does all the scenery-changing for you. You get to stay put. You get to eat. You get to party. You get to feel like you've been to a restaurant, lounge, club, and anything else in between, all over the course of one night. Most importantly, you get to feel like a real privileged, VIP son of a bitch.

Let's start with the food. The Caprese is surprisingly fresh - thick slices of mozzarella di bufala accompanied by grape tomatoes. The Cavatelli with Ricotta and Asparagus, however, is just an awful pasta dish, no two ways about it - dry, bland, and unappetizing. But honestly, you shouldn't be coming here exclusively for the food. You should be coming here mainly for the party.

The waitresses will trade in their dinner service red pencil skirts and white button-down shirts (unbuttoned quite a few buttons - please, they know what they're doin') for glitzy, sequined, super-short cocktail dresses once the restaurant is turned over into discotheque mode. Tables are broken down, the house music starts its slow build, lights are dimmed to near darkness, and the bottles and sparklers are paraded through the establishment as the official indicator the real night has only just begun.

What was once a mild-mannered, trendy dining experience is now a full-blown club. The drinks are flowing, the beats are pounding off the walls, the house is absolutely packed, and, seriously, you will never see so many dimes in one spot. Model-caliber, French Canadian dimes. Bachelor party bros, take note.

The crowd outside waiting to get into this establishment is unbelievable - a huge horde of dolled-up twenty-somethings (at a number to match the capacity indoors, mind you) with the pretty limited chance they will ever make it inside. This tells me that these people would rather be dressed to the nines outside on some line with only the chance of getting in as opposed to spending their night at some lesser bar along Saint Laurent. Do I blame them? Having been on the inside, it's kinda hard to say. While there are better places to eat, I find it hard to believe there are better places to party. If these people know to be at Buonanotte once the sun goes down, then you gotta believe these people know what's good. If you're ever in Montreal, certainly save Buonanotte for your baller night out."}
{"text":"This places is NOT good at all and I'm not even a picky person. Servers are indifferent. Not even nice . 
I asked if the dish I wanted to order contains meat and before  I even had a chance to continue what I was about to say  she goes \"You can have it with a different sauce \" she turned around and left immediately . 
When I was finally able to get a hold of her I kindly told  her that I would like to make sure this dish comes with no meat and she replied \" Yes you told me already \"  turned around and  left ! 
Are you serious ?!
Besides the fact that food tasted horrible it takes a VERY long time to get your food . A friend of mine was waiting for at least 20-25 mins for a glass of wine she ordered .
Save your time and money and go somewhere else.
P.S must say the Nutella crepe dessert was pretty good but still not worth going there"}
{"text":"After a good time at yuk yuks, 5 of us decided to go here and have light dinner. The restaurant has modern decor and the staff made the restaurant feel upscale. I was pretty hungry, so I was afraid of how much I would end up having to pay at the end of the night. The menu items are on the pricier side for sure, but everything sounded delicious. I decided to have pasta and I wanted meat in it, so I got the Italian sausage pasta. Others had salads, pizza and an amazing looking octopus appetizer. 

I've never had grilled octopus and was reluctant to try it. It was exactly what I imagined it to be: chewy. Everyone else enjoyed it though, so I guess I should recommend it. My pasta portion looked tiny at first, but I was sooooo full! It was delicious and I would definitely recommend that dish to others. I tried a little bit of the salad with pears (it was very refreshing) and I also tried the pizza with some sort of sliced meat on it. Whatever it was, it was really good. The dough is thin and almost felt like a fresh out of the oven pita. It was burnt in some places, but it made it feel more authentic.

Finally, the dessert. We decided to get cannolis and I think they gave us panna cotta on the house or it came with the cannolis? Either way...wow! The panna cotta was incredible! I would honestly just go back to this place for that. It was so smooth and so creamy...just thinking about it makes me want some (and I just ate!). 

Our waitress was extremely nice, so the service definitely met my expectations. Before we left, the restaurant turned into a mini club. It was a bit awkward as we were not in the mood to dance, so we sat at our table for a bit, listened to the music, and then left. Overall, it was a great experience. I read some of the reviews while I was eating and was a bit surprised at how negative they were. Maybe we just got lucky? Anyway, if you want a nice pizza or pasta in an upscale environment, come here. If you want something more rustic and authentic, maybe look elsewhere. If you're craving panna cotta, definitely try it here!"}
{"text":"I was here for the F1 weekend and we had dinner reservations for the price fixed menu (~80pp).  Since the price fixed menu only included two small dishes, someone in our group made an executive decision to get the group share option at about the same price.  They basically bring out a plate of meat and seafood (well I'll use the term seafood loosely b/c we got 2 shrimps and one piece of lobster) with no sides.  The meat was very fatty and salty.  Mind you we had 6 people in our party.  See pic.  Anyways, to sum it up, the real reason to come here for dinner is to reserve your spot for the club later.  Dinner was a complete butt rape, excuse me for being unlady like.  If you aren't already in there, the line is super long and it's a $35 dollar cover charge if you don't have a table.  So 12am rolls around and the music was not really my thing.  The DJ was spinning some disco crap suitable for studio 54.  I was honestly ready to leave at this point but the people watching was fantastic.  It's very pretentious I'm not going to lie, but there were soooo many GORGEOUS people there!  Even the servers are all 10s!  Unreal.  Anyways, I was ready to dip at this point because I'm a music person.  I need good music to have fun.  Let me just tell you I'm glad I didn't because around 1am, it was like a mf'n light switch flipped and this easily became one of the sickest clubs I had ever been to.  All the tables cleared, and suddenly there were girls dancing on tables and the music....OMG the music......the music was AMAZING.  He spun everything from 80's, to hip hop, to HOUSE!  It was one huge dance party.  Good times.  

*1 star for food and 5 stars for club*"}
{"text":"I had the steak for 2 and the food was good. We had a good time conversing while on a bachelor party and probably the other half staring at the waitresses. Thats why they dress them like they do in the short skirts right?  That would never fly in the US and I love it."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and stayed afterwards for the nightclub. Their food was amazing. Their duck ravioli was amazing but a little on the heavy side. Most of the people on our table ordered the pizzas, which make you think you're in Italy. Totally authentic Italian food. Great environment."}
{"text":"Went out for a friend's birthday, I came in after dinner and we had bottle service. The place looks really good and everyone is dressed to the T. We had bottle service and all the staff we interacted with were excellent. With the exception of our booth for the bottle service which was promised throughout the dinner time and never materialized once dinner was over. Once the party was on, the place got rammed and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. I wasn't a fan of the DJ's selection of dance or hip-hop music. It wasn't a good selection to pump people up for dancing and the remixed versions of the songs weren't great. Overall, I would recommend this place for drinks only before heading somewhere else."}
{"text":"We dropped in here for some dinner after arriving in Montreal. After a long drive up from NYC a fun spot was what we were looking for.

We walked by and the whole front was open and the sounds of pumping music could be heard. The waitstaff all looked like fashion models - men from an issue of GQ and women that could be seen at the Playbiy mansion or working the hottest clubs in Vegas. I guess the main prerequisite when interviewing to work this place is that you have to \"Zoolander really really really good looking\".

We scored a table by the front window, ordered up some cocktails, cold beer, and some eats. The drinks hit the spot to start up our vacation, and the food was tasty enough. Our waitress was new and still learning but very nice. As some others have mentioned here it's not about the food but more about the party scene and people watching going on.

There were many large groups here that evening and as the night went on and people finished eating the tables were one by one moved aside to set up the dining area into a dance floor and club setting. DJ was on-hand spinning tunes. It's definitely more of a spot to see and be seen.

We decided to move on and walk the streets of Montreal when we finished but perhaps next time in town we'll get our groove on here."}
{"text":"Food is mostly terrible. I disliked it the first time I went and also the second time. Its a great place for a partying but I would suggest having dinner elsewhere"}
{"text":"Absolutely NO!!!! Read this and save money! Worst service experience in my life. Horrific experience on a 950$ bill where we were invoiced before even getting our food. That's right....they brought the bill before the food which itself was 2 hours late. This is a teeny bopper nightclub that offers food service as a hobby. Read the other reviews...I wish I had. Paid the bill just to get the heck out of there. The manager offered us desserts. It was insulting."}
{"text":"Service was not bad, but the food was not exceptional. Bland at best. Ate calamari and was chewing on it for 15 mins, also had a margarita pizza and there was no flavour."}
{"text":"Arguably one of the better dining Italian restaurants in Montreal. Situated in the entertainment district on St Laurent Blvd. This restaurant has been here for more than 20 years. It's still a restaurant that turns into a dance club Thursdays to weekend around midnight. We ordered Squid Ink Tagliatelle and Capuzelle do Agnello with red wine. We also ordered an appetizer of short rib BBQ. The Good: The decor hasn't changed. Very modern inside ( because turns into a club at night), has a DJ, great for groups. They still have the wall of plates signed by famous entertainers and athletes who come to town. The Bad: Not a lot of choices if you're a vegetarian and no choices at all if you like chicken. The Ugly: quite expensive for traditional Italian meals. Need to talk over the loud music playing over dinner. You can buy $8,500-$11,000 wine or champagne. Wow! Tip: If you want to go clubbing later I suggest you reserve between 8:30-9 for dinner stay when it changes into a club no cover charge for entry. Pricey $$$-$$$$"}
{"text":"Came here last night for a gfs birthday. We had a booth which was a restaurant table, but I guess because it's a supper club that is the norm. 
The music was really good and it was def packed. The got 4-6 bottles of goose (can't remember lol) and had a great time. 
Want to def come back for dinner! Hopefully the Toronto site will be up and running with a menu to check out soon!"}
{"text":"Came here when visiting Montreal with some friends. We were looking for a club with a crowd in the 25+ range that would be a guarantees good time and this came recommended by a few people.

We reserved a table ahead of time and got in no problem. We did have to wait about 30 minutes to be seated because they needed to turn the tables from dinner to bottle service. Given that this is also a restaurant you have to wait for people to finish eating before setting up shop for bottle service. This was the only remotely negative thing for the evening..

Once seated, and it was a great time from start to finish. The DJ absolutely killed it and the place was on fire the entire night. A perfect mix of music genres and people dancing straight through. 

The bottle prices are very inexpensive compared to NYC and other big markets in the US. It also is an absolute must to get a bottle of you're a group of guys coming here, or any good club for that matter. Otherwise you won't get in or you'll be standing in line for hours only to be squeezed in between 300 people once inside.

This place was hands down one of the better club experiences I've had. The best of all places in Montreal I've been to from a nightlife standpoint. Definitely a must if you're looking for hands down good time."}
{"text":"This review is for the club portion ONLY - NOT FOOD!

We came on a Friday night around 1ish and this place was popping! There was a line to get in, but it moved really quickly. Once inside, there was plenty of tables for bottles and a small area for dancing in front of the DJ. There is also a raised area that's tables all around with a small area for dancing. The bar was SUPER crowded and it was so difficult to get a drink since they put seat around the bar so you literally had to read over the people sitting at the bar to get a drink. Kind of a poor design and that definitely put a damper on our night...

Other than that it was actually pretty fun. The DJ played a mix of EDM and top 40s throughout the night and kept the crowd energized - only comment is that he seemed to change songs every 20-30 seconds! No mixing, just playing popular songs one after the other! 

The place has a nice set-up and the clientele were all well dressed and good looking. There were def some 19+ as well as 25+ people so it's very diverse. Oddly, we met a lot of people from NY and not too many people from Montreal! Guess, lots of people just head there from NY bc it's close and relatively cheaper than partying in NY? Overall, we had a fun time, but it was pretty crowded."}
{"text":"Let me explain my experience here. I walked into this restaurant, where there were about 10 tables open inside, and was asked if we had a reservation... Then we asked to sit outside where no one else was sitting. We asked to sit at a table closer to the street but apparently al of the 12 tables were reserved. Once we were seated, my boyfriend and I watched three waiters stand and talk to each other for ten minutes without ever coming over. Needless to say we left."}
{"text":"This is, by far, the most obnoxious restaurant in Montreal. 
The stellar reviews here are mostly coming from out-of-towners but for local Montrealers, Buona Notte is a bit of parody of itself and the whole \"St.Laurent Street\" scene. See, back in the late 1980s, that area of St. Laurent between Sherbrooke and Pine was where all the most exclusive restos and clubs were, filled to the hilt with the beautiful people, aspiring actresses, models and high-end escorts, places like Business, Mediterraneo or DiSalvio's. Most of them are long-gone now and only Buona Notte still hangs on. Come Formula 1 weekend, you can only book a table at Buona Notte if you agree to the $5000 \"bottling fee\"  and its filled with F1 jet-set types and the aforementioned models and escorts-types hoping to make a break. The reek of desperation and posturing and posing is enough to make you lose your meal.

This has a good-looks-and-money entrance policy. If you don't make the cut, you're not getting in and even if you do have a reservation, they'll place you at one of the worse-off tables in the back near the kitchen and no where near the front. I came here once on a date years ago and I remember the waitresses in skimpy super-tight dresses, the wall of signed plates by the likes of Nick Rhodes of Duran Duran-fame or Jerry Lewis. As for the food, it was awful, bland and over-priced beyond belief. When you come to Buona Notte, you're not coming here for the food. You're coming here to see and to be seen and that really irritates an avowed leftist and anarchist like myself."}
{"text":"Went there to promote the anniversary of the restaurant where I used to work with my coworkers (we were around 12).
Ambiance was really nice, really liked the music that was being played that night. We had a few bottles of champagne and they all came in a cage with little fireworks. Really had a blast that night. We were given a few complimentary bottles of water, which was really appreciated. 
Would definitely return."}
{"text":"it was recommended to me to check this place out, more for the ambiance, and to try a \"supper club\" experience.  I came from Chicago for a quick weekend trip.  On a friday night, we were able to walk in without reservations (2 females much easier to accommodate apparently).  This place was packed, and it was about 8pm at night.  The servers  were amazingly attractive male and females, all tall and very nice people.  The man at the front that helped us get seated, was very attractive, flirtatious and when he found out we were from chicago, was shocked as he said , thats an amazing culinary city...yes...it is....
we read the reviews coming in but my friend said..\"how badly can you mess up pasta??\"
oh boy...
apparently really really badly....
this was the absolute worst italian food i have ever had..the caprese salad...needed salt..how do you mess that up!?  my pasta was a pesto pasta...lacked garlic, flavor and was extremely dry.  we had to go back and order room service.  
the scene...yes...its definitely a place to get dressed up, look hot and meet many attractive people, likely not locals...great scene for a bachelorette or bachelor party...pricey for such awful food...maybe its the fact that i'm from chicago and had higher expectations?  nah...this place is awful, you are better off just making your own batch of pastaroni at home...eat before u come...just come in for the night scene.
expect a line after 10pm....
definitely dress to impress...
don't plan on having a lot of conversation here either..its extremely loud!"}
{"text":"This place literally fucking  sucks, they advertise it turning into a club at 11 on weekends, but run out of beer at 10:30. It's way over priced for the crappy food you get, and the music and service are shitty. Would never go again."}
{"text":"For dinner - this place offers good food, but the real draw is the waitresses, hostesses and bartenders.  They are all gorgeous...beyond gorgeous, out of this world.  A collection of women this gorgeous is normally reserved for the superbly rich, oil tycoons or the playboy mansion.

So with that said - the food - was only ok.  It was all high quality food prepped well, but the main draw wasn't the food.  The waitresses walked around being pretty and talking to the customers and kneeling down to show off cleavage for...\"fan service\".

So had a lot of food, including this massive steak, meat balls, pasta with duck in a wonderful cream sauce, a panchetta pizza, among other things.  We spent a pretty penny there but all in all it was a good experience.  The waitresses are all really friendly so that helps. 

We were invited to come back later when it turns into a club, but we opted not to since we had other plans."}
{"text":"This place was horrible!! My friend and I went there because someone recommended it.. All we saw is a bunch of young Arabic american students (males) spending ridiculous amount of money on drinks and buying girls drinks as well.. It was insane how some of the girls were gold digging!! Oh!! Go there if you want to see girls snort coke in the restroom!! Horrible experience ever!! All the people there seem incredible fake and all about the \"money\"; at least that is what every person there was talking about.."}
{"text":"basic basic food do like the ambiance and great music, i had a salad that i don't remember being extraordinary gives you an idea how great that was."}
{"text":"My friend and I went there last night.

The interior was nice, clearly the ceiling was the highlight of the place. My server was very friendly and attentive. 

I had the daily risotto with a glass of Merlot, last night's was a wild mushroom risotto. My friend had the wild mushroom tagliatelle with a cocktail. The food was solid, there's no denying that, though, it certainly wasn't meant to be filling. For dessert, I had the three cheese platter, I chose the gorgonzola, piave, and pecorino. My friend had the bombolini al cioccolato 

To sum up, it was overpriced for what I received. If you want to impress (and have the wallet for it), then by all means go there. However, for a holistic experience, go elsewhere. My friend and I learned that the hard way last night."}
{"text":"Amusing place.  I had asked a female business contact I knew in town for a recommendation, as I was going to be travelling to the city with three grad school buddies.  This was described as a fun restaurant for a guys dinner/night out. We laughed when we entered, as we then understood what my friend had meant.  The waitstaff was striking, all dolled up in smaller than avg dresses.  Not trashy, but also not elegant dining.  The food was fine, nothing to get excited about.  The restaurant also morphs into a nightclub later on.  One bachelorette party came and took a few pictures at our table, again not five star dining but amusing.  Not what we had been looking for this night, but still fun for what it is."}
{"text":"Terrible. That's all I got. I'm here right now, and instead of enjoying myself, I feel compelled to point out that this is the worst DJ in THE WORLD"}
{"text":"Oh Bunonatte, I don't know if I want to love you for your highs or hate you for your lows. It was quite the roller coaster experience we had here. Let's see where we net out by the end of this review.

The restaurant immediately gives off the lounge/club feel as soon as you walk through the door. Dark lighting, but the beauty comes from the lovely waitresses they have to serve your meal. Although we discovered later on that night that our table was nothing more than a fold up picnic table, the decor was very appealing.

See how we started so high? Guess what? Its time for our first drop! As beautiful and kind our waitresses were, maybe there wasn't enough of them because the service was probably the slowest I've ever had. We're not talking continuously reassure you, apologies, and endless bread slow. We're talking minimal bread, leave you to ponder the wonders of the universe and where in the Domino's tracker process your meal is.

Well wasn't that a wild first drop? Oh look we're about to go through a few hills YAAAAY! So on to the meal. Definitely important to try the Lumache which is Roasted Burgundy snails, smoked caciocavallo, wild garlic flower, bone marrow. Why you ask? You're in Montreal JUST DO IT MAN ITS JUST SNAILS! They were very tasty and the risk was definitely worth the reward. I personally had the TAGLIATELLE (Garlic flower tagliatelle, clams and spicy pangrattato) for my meal. While nowhere near the spice i'm used to, it was a delicious meal. Unfortunately however, the chef missed the requested cook on multiple of my friend's meals and there were complaints that some of them were a bit cold OH NOOOO ANOTHER DROP WOOOOOO! 

After complaining about the service and some of our meals the restaurant did do a great job in rectifying the situation and seated us at our VIP table in a spot that we requested for the rest of the night. As for the club portion we were absolutely turnt up the whole night. Great music and a great time for the remainder of our stay! Buony, we had some rough times that night, but you sure do know how to cook some snails and throw a party. I'll remain a neutral 3-stars on the place for now."}
{"text":"#disappointing.

Visited as part of a large group.  Management hires attractive staff who are rather unskilled at the restaurant business.  Expect long waits for service.  Time from first  drink order to drinks at table was 20 mins+.  One of of our group had their entree arrive 45 mins after everyone else.  

A hip hop DJ creates a club scene, which would be cool if you don't want to talk to anyone since it's pretty high I the decibel scale.  Your ears will ring after a meal here if you have a later seating.

Exception is the food.  All dishes were better than expected.  Cheers to the kitchen staff for doing a solid job even when the front of the house is disorganized."}
{"text":"NYE DINNER PARTY - spent  $95  per person to have a meal that you'd pay less than $20 for. . Sure, the place is trendy,  crowd was good and everything else was less than mediocre. They really tried to sell their bottle service to everyone starting at $695.  So if you're like me with four people we had spent  $400 --on dinner, $100 bottle of wine and bottles of sparkling water and our bill was already at $700 plus tip.  If we wanted to keep the small table we had to shell out another  $700? Talk about taking advantage of your patrons. Once you had our dinner money,  you guys pretty much said now beat it and let us make more money. Now If the food was off the charts and the service had been white glove, then I can  see why there would be a premium,  but this was just annoying and unacceptable. 
So all in all, this will be the last visit to your place and I'll be making sure that none of my friends and co-workers will be dining there anytime soon!  
Happy new year!"}
{"text":"Rarely do I try a new place without checking Yelp, but I didn't in this case ~ and well....

The food is mediocre and the service slow ...just as the others described.

I had the tomato mozzarella salad.  Over ripe tomatoes, bland cheese, tiny portions.  Over priced. 

Not to mention, they had double booked our table and although the service was painfully slow, the hostess told us to essential eat quickly as the second group had arrived for their seating?!"}
{"text":"Gorgeous decor but fairly bad service.
We were a party of 9 and the service was slow slow slow. Furthermore, two of us got a pasta dish with VERY undercooked noodles. When we brought it to the server's attention she was full of attitude and tried to tell us that that's what al denté tastes like. Her tone was very undermining and rude.
Food was okay, but definitely not worth the attitude and service.
Won't be coming back"}
{"text":"First time I've been here at this club/restaurant.  I was attending a party celebrating a friends birthday.  They did a great job with customized printed menu's at the table which was a nice touch.  The menu that our hosts selected were awesome however it was served family style which is fine however there didn't seem to be enough of salad, pizza and meat course.  I found it odd that the first course being a beautiful salad that was delicious wasn't served individually plated.  The pizza was good however they served small pizzas we had to share at the table and they were not even cut.  These are really small individual pizzas being passed off as serving a table of people.  We had to ask waiter to cut our pizza which took more time and did not make sense that they would not do it before as we had to share.  My favourite part of meal was bread and dessert.  We had bottle service so booze was free flowing.  I wait staff was nice for dinner however one of the servers in particular was not friendly at times which was surprising as it's a party and our hosts are dropping some major coin on his shin dig.  When the club part of evening started, the place was pretty empty for a Saturday night.  Not sure if this place has lost its allure it had in the past but seems like whatever made them successful in the past isn't working.  The tunes were ok, aimed at an older crowd and although this was my first experience here, will not come again as not worth the money and value your getting."}
{"text":"Hey Tiff, how was....

The Reason: 
I was in Toronto for a girls weekend and we were looking for a lounge to visit after dinner.  After roaming the streets downtown for a few minutes, we stumbled across this lounge.  I heard about it from a local so I said \"when in Rome, do as the Romans do!\"  We walked up and inquired about the cost for entry.  Unfortunately, since we arrived so late the very UNpleasant and semi-arrogant bouncer kindly told us \"bottle service ONLY\" then dismissed us.  He then quickly turned around and walked back in the lounge.  We thought about leaving (since there are other options on that street) but quickly changed our minds after hearing the music they were playing.   We decided since we looked like models we might as well do bottles! #BottleswithModels #BeautifulPeople!

The Scene:  
DJ is in the back surrounded by tables and plush furniture.  The bar was on the left when you enter.  Energetic and loud scene.  I didn't see a dance floor but most people danced near their tables or on the bar..well at least the bartenders did.   More like club versus a mellow lounge.  The bathrooms are small and there's only a few stalls.

The Playlist:
Hip-hop, R&B when we arrived (club bangers)

The Drinks: 
I didn't get a chance to order or glance at the regular cocktail menu, next time

The Food: 
Sorry guys, I was went for the drinks and music.  

The Service: 
Once we passed the \"gate\" keeper at the door, our VIP/Bottle service host Aundrae was SUPER COOL.  He was so chill and took care of us - shout out to DRE!! I can't remember our waitress but she was nice

The Dam$ge: 
I can't remember - guess I'll see the damage on my next statement..I think for a bottle of champagne we paid ~$150

The Location: 
Mercer Street reminds me a lot of New York.  Although Mercer is a side street there's a lot of places to visit up and down the street

The Parking: 
There's a parking lot a few meters (look at me converting to meters vs. miles) down, short walk

The D'Over?: 
100% - yes

{"text":"The service was really bad. Our waitress even go lectured in front of us by another waitress for taking too long. They didn't refill the water. They have a requirement of a minimum order of $25 per person. Everyone I came with said their food was very average and nothing special. The pizza is greasy. The pasta is bland. The fish is a tiny little piece in the center of the plate. Finally they gave my group only one bill and refused to separate it, which is another hassle for us. 
I can't say the same for the party afterwards. Especially if DJ Yossi is there it will be a good night. He plays great music and gets people dancing!
But I won't ever eat here again!"}
{"text":"The best pizza I have had outside of New York and Italy!   The chocolate pudding dessert is a must have.  Great wine, friendly and knowledgable staff.  An excellent Toronto establishment."}
{"text":"My friends and I have really enjoyed visiting this night club. They play amazing music and the bottle service here is great as well. Definitely recommend checking out this Montréal classic!"}
