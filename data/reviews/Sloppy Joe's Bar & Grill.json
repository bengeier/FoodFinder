{"text":"huge portions....... but my bf got food poisoning from the wings....the fries are gross, think McCains microwave fries, the dipping sauce is also pretty bad"}
{"text":"Good wings but the rest of the menu is in need of a big makeover. They are missing an opportunity by not improving it.   Nice new decor. Bathrooms also need a makeover - badly."}
{"text":"The wings in this place are quite simply unlike any you can get anywhere.  They must come from mutant chickens or something.  I find the Medium sauce has the best flavour, and I'm the kind of guy who generally orders wings from other places in hot (though not suicide) sauce."}
{"text":"Can't beat their wings. Best in Toronto, bar none!"}
{"text":"I was there on a Saturday afternoon. I ordered chicken wings, it took a while but there were good. Waitress was new but nice and helpful. They have good variety of beers. I will come back for sure."}
{"text":"went this evening with a group of friends - only positive thing about the place is the wings: big, meaty and cheap on wing nights.  Top 3 in Toronto, probably.  but the negatives outweigh the positives:  my friend ordered her steak med rare, it arrived med well; our obviously overwhelmed server dropped a tray of beer 4 feet from our table (lucky it wasn t near the table), but the topper for me is we went to pay by debit and, guess what, \"sorry we don't take debit\".    Sorry but are you kidding ?  A bar this size in this age doesn't take debit? WTF? They take Visa (which costs the merchant more than debit) and they have one of those f in mafia grey market ATM's that cost $5 bucks to use.... uh...no thanks.   It baffles me why some restaurants in Toronto don't take debit.... that, along with the other errors prompt me to say:  \"sorry, not coming back again\""}
{"text":"Best Chicken wings in Toronto. Staff is pretty good, response time varies depend upon how busy it is. Best on Lakeshore"}
{"text":"An amazing sports bar with screens all around you. I was sick of all the wings and wings provided by sports bar, but Sloppy Joe actually provided many other options and the most important, they are tasty. We went there in the NFL night and no doubt the place was crowded. One of the security was so kind he found a place for us and kept us away from the storm outside. The waitress also did a good job, she'd never forgot us even with all the tables were full. Overall a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Best wings in Town! Their spice ratings really mean what they say: hot is really hot. On Thursday evenings this place is hopping. It's an American-style sports bar, with Budwiser promotional gear all over the place: so don't expect local craft brewed beer here.  If you like sports, beer, noisy raucous crowds, and the best wings in town, then I highly recommend this place. It's a little bit out of the way, but if you live in south Etobicoke, you would be hard pressed to find a better bar."}
{"text":"Was at the beer store across the street. My wife and I wanted a night in. I have driven by sloppy joes everyday for the past couple of years. Thanks to yelp we decided to call for take out. I ordered 10 wings mild and a sloppy Joe sandwich with fries. First off the portion was enormous. Two of us shared each meal and couldn't come close to finishing. The price was a little over $20. Which was fantastic. We ate Saturday night bar food for $10 each. Never seen wings that big. There probably raised on an all you can't eat chicken feeder barn. The sloppy Joe sandwich looked like it came out of a can. But exceeded expectations with a great taste. Coleslaw was warm. Should be served separately. Fries had a great fat oily taste to them. Probably super calories. Picked up food at bar. Waitress very polite and was eager to serve. Will go back again next Saturday and dine in. Thank u very much sloppy joes."}
{"text":"If you are a Chicken Wing aficionado - then you must visit!  The wings here are enormous and the salt and pepper breading has amazing flavour.  If you are a fan of the smaller fryer type wings then these ones might not be for you.  This non-chain pub/bar is probably the best in South Etobicoke - the reason being that there are not a lot of great ones in the area unfortunately.  The decor is decent inside, it is a comfortable bar with lots of TV's - however it does need updating and going down to the washroom is a voyage to the dungeon where only hobbits would find the narrow stairs and ceiling height acceptable.  Thankfully they renovated the washrooms recently.  It's better in the summer, when the patio is open as well.  Given the dungeon washroom issue and the fact they serve chicken wings and ribs, it would be a great idea to put a sink area in the main level for customers who just need to wash up!   I have only one issue with this place and it is that the owner/management does not realize how important customer service should be and it really makes or breaks the ongoing success of their business.  I brought a colleague to try the amazing wings and he has been in the bar business for 15 years and was appalled by the resounding NO answers he received to every request.  He first asks for 15 wings, 7 medium and 8 honey garlic.  They said NO - can't do that - if you order 20 wings then they could do 10 hot and 10 honey garlic.  He didn't want that many, so he asked if they could just do 15 wings but mix the hot sauce and honey garlic together.  We were told that the cook won't mix 2 sauces together. I couldn't think of why. I even offered for them to charge us for the extra sauce. I was then told that wasn't the reason.  The reason was that they only had 6 bowls to toss their wings in, 1 for each sauce. This is when we were blown away! We said to our server that you mean the reason I the customer cannot receive my simple request is because your cook won't take a minute to rinse out a bowl after tossing the wings. Unbelievable!!  Why don't they just buy the cook an extra bowl?  Makes you wonder if they ever wash out the bowls?  I am just glad, I always order my wings plain, sauce on the side.    Please management - read this and understand how stupid this sounds to your customers!!!   I brought you a new customer and you lost him on the first try - he will not be coming back and I think I will reduce my visits as well!"}
{"text":"Sloppy Joe's is a semi-dive bar located on Lakeshore Blvd in Etobicoke. They are known for their chicken wings, so that's what I ordered along with a sloppy joe, nachos, and fries.  The wings come with several sticks of celery and carrots with ranch sauce. A+ I ordered the hot and honey garlic flavour. The wings were huge and meaty. I wish they were served a bit hotter in temperature, but still tasty. After 10, I was full. I also ordered a full rack of half priced ribs ($20 to $10). These were decent, needed more sauce.  I will order sauce on the side for my wings and ribs in the future. Come here for wing nights on Tues and Thurs, Or rib night Mon and Wed.  They have a ton of TV's for the game. Tons of beers on tap. Bathroom downstairs is a bit of a trek, be careful walking down."}
{"text":"There chicken wings are okay a bit blah. But there is a so much better place just down the road. Overall I would rate this place a 7/10. Service was slow. The wings where meh not what I was hoping for. I'd be going down the road for my wings from now on."}
{"text":"The name says it all!  One of the best bars in the city to chug a cold beer, eat messy food and watch hockey!  The place fills up fast on game nights, but has many tv's so you won't miss any of the action where ever you sit.  The big draw of theis place is the wings.  Big, hot gooey wings.  Its an endless fight over who makes the best wings in T.O., but these are the best in the West End!  Can get loud, so its not the best for a first date, but its perfect for a thirsty group of hockey fans who don't want to go home hungry!"}
{"text":"It's a good place to eat chicken wings, they have different kinds of sauces, I tried almost every one of them and all were delicious. Once I came here for ribs that was also tasty and a portion was big. When it comes to service there is always a room for improvement."}
{"text":"Whoa! The longer I'm in this area the more and more I realize that you should not judge any south Etobicoke businesses by their \"cover\" I was working away in a near-by coffee shop and felt I earned a cheat meal and a cold pint of beer - we've all had 'those days' right?  I've passed Sloppy Joe's a bunch of times but wrote it off in my head as a local dive. I decided to give a whirl this time as my thirst exceeded past judgments and wow, it totally redeemed itself. It wasn't scary inside at all, just a classic local pub with a massive wooden bar, small dance floor and an abundance of large flat screen TVs facing every possible direction (so you can watch from anywhere in the restaurant).  Their beer selection is domestic mostly with a few well known foreign premiums on tap as well. There even was a couple of one-off craft beers but none that I heard of before.  As for the menu, I was super into the idea of having a Sloppy Joe, I mean where do you ever see those on a menu? But then as I looked over the pictures on Yelp I was swayed to ordering chicken wings as most reviews and pictures bragged about how great these were. You can order either 10 or 20 wings on the menu (that's approximately 1.5 or 3 pounds of wings) in a variety of standard sauces. I opted for the 20 as I'm accustomed to tiny pub wings. Not here. In what I thought was a very long time later (for chicken wings) a pile of large wings was placed before me - these were not 'standard' by any means and their size made clear to me the extra cooking time likely needed to make these perfect.  These were some of the plumpest, moist, delicious wings I've had in some time. Perfectly cooked through and perfectly sauced (hot and honey for me). Not one wing was burned or over cooked on the outside and they were so hot that I could barely hold them for too long!!! Ordering 20 for one person was definitely too much for me, I couldn't even finish them, there were still about 4 left, and I'm pretty sure I was full by my 10th or 11th wing.  Quite a review, I know, for chicken wings but these were a big surprise and definitely a hidden gem in my opinion. If you're near Longbranch and Lakeshore look up Sloppy Joes and come for the wings (or try a sloppy joe).  Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about how great the wings are here, and I was not disappointed. We went here on a Friday night after work and we tried the calimari, coconut shrip, nachos, onion rings, jalapeno poppers, and chicken wings. All the food was standard pup fare but the chicken wings were definetly the highlight. They are big but were not dry or over cooked. I tried wings with a few different sauces and all tasted great! The suicide was a little too spicy for my taste so if you aren't sure ask for it on the side. Staff was nice and did not mind customizing the sauces. Worth going back."}
{"text":"Sloppy Joe's serve the biggest and best wings of anywhere in Toronto that I have eaten.  Tuesdays and Thursdays are wing night, .60 cent wings, 3pm to midnight.  Minimum 10 each order and you can order in increments of 5 after that.  They are amazing either with sauce on them or sauce on the side.  They also have a really great Greek salad, the owner told us the dressing they use is his Grandmothers recipe.  They don't have a veggie plate on the menu, but will make you up one to go with your wings if you ask.  They just recently updated the interior, it's now much nicer, lots of large screens.  They do have a patio but it's quite small and filled with smokers."}
{"text":"Almost Perfect...  A cozy sports bar, with tons of darts boards and a few pool tables.  We went on a WEDNESDAY, and were surprised to find it to be  HALF PRICE RIB NIGHT  - a full rack for $10.50.  The ribs were okay... nothing special.  Our server was cute in her little booty shorts and kept the conversation light and fun.  The kitchen and server work well with  timing the food and the order of its delivery (apps before entrees, and not at the same time).   Pro - Fun atmosphere with a classical rustic wooden finish, tons of TV's, and the food is at the level you'd expect for an upscale bar,   There are tons of places to sit, so no matter where you are you'll be able to watch the game clearly.  Con - The bar has no way of splitting pitchers on your bill, and when everyone wants separate bills --- this only leads to problems.  We were there on a game night, and it does get rather load due to the constricting layout.   There was little to no time put into the presentation of the meals.  It looked like the food is just thrown onto the plate -- however i suppose it is a bar...    Recommendation  Try to avoid ordering both the Nachos Supreme and the Sloppy Joe in the same sitting because they both use the same meat. -- Its just a lot of meat.   Besides the complication with splitting the pitchers between bills and the average food.  This sports bar is ...  ...almost perfect"}
{"text":"The jalepeno poppers here are popping. Also our server was very helpful (I didn't catch her name. Pretty girl, dark hair, lot's of tattoos) when we were trying to pick apps for the table, and very attentive. She was very quick, even though we were in for a very busy hockey game.  My only complaint is that it's very very loud in here. I know the  sound was on for the game, but even with all the people it was a bit deafening. Couldn't hear my boyfriend at all and he was right beside me."}
{"text":"Let's start with the positives -  Huge wings - tasty, crunchy & seasoned in delicious sauce ( we had medium and honey garlic)  Good drinks (Caesar was spot on) Big booths and large TVs  Negatives Came on family day & restaurant was less than half full would not call it busy at all ( so no excuse for the fact we were ignored and had poor service)  Sat down and after 15 minutes server asked if we were ready to order ... Not offered drinks at all.  We ordered drinks &  wings and after another ten minutes and watching server pass by our drinks at the bar a dozen times we went and got our OWN DRINK ORDER FROM THE BAR. Bartender didn't seem to care (maybe this is the norm)  After we finished our drinks we asked for two glasses of water We were served two small glasses wit tap water (no ice) from the back sink at the server station. One sip and it tasted terrible. We asked again if we could have two ice waters from the bar. Server argued \"it's the exact same water\" and brings is a small cup of ice !?!?! What the hell!?!?  Never asked how our food was Never cleaned our dirty plates our wing bowls our empty cups or asked if we needed anything In fact we had to as for CUTLERY, ketchup, vinegar, water, more beer and takeout boxes Nothing was being \"served to us\" so I can't even say there was any service   Won't be back Will think about picking up their wings to go but not until I recover from how bad this experience was"}
{"text":"As mentioned by my fellow Yelpers, the wings are massive and delicious! The suicide sauce definitely had me sweating and had a nice kick to it.   Service was a little slow and not that attentive or friendly. I couldn't finish all of my wings so I took them home. Otherwise, it's a great place for wing night in a busy and bustling sports bar."}
{"text":"The biggest chicken wings on the planet!!! Service is amazing Laura the bartender and the rest of the wait staff are so friendly, great beer selection with over 15 beers on tap! If your ever in the area it's worth checking out!!!!"}
{"text":"We did take out from here and thoroughly enjoyed it. As other reviewers have said, the chicken wings are really good!"}
{"text":"Went Early Thursday 430 pm. Jays game on, lots of TVS. Wing night 70cents@. Large wings I got mild. They were crispy and lots of meat. Our server was great friendly. Took care if us. Mind you we did tip a couple of San Remo donuts I brought for my friends. Jays beat Yankees everything good"}
{"text":"This restaurant is TERRIBLE. If I could give it negative stars I would. We went there for wing night, which is apparently what it is known for, and ordered mild wings, we cannot eat spicy food. The wings arrived and they were spicy hot so we told the waitress and she took them back to the kitchen. She comes back and drops the same plate on our table and says \"these are our mild wings\". Fraser tells her we can't eat them and she walks away. Later he talks to the manager and asks him to adjust our bill and he said \"why the f.. should I.  Crappy food, crappy service, crappy owner and crappy waitress. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS"}
{"text":"Good but expensive chicken wings that don't even come with the standard blue cheese sauce/carrots/celery accompaniment, although you can get nearly rotten celery and carrot for an extra charge I discovered.   Nothing else on the menu is any good, tried this place a few times with other people and aside from the good albeit expensive wings, disappointment was on the menu.  Decent beer selection but keg freshness is questionable with a majority crowd of Bud/Blue light drinks who crowd around the front door to smoke."}
{"text":"Ordered the sloppy joe and it was not that great.  If the name sake is sub par I think it says alot about a place.  Based of these reviews, maybe I would go back to try the wings."}
{"text":"For this west end of Etobicoke, the best bar. Staff is friendly, cool. Great set up, space. Food is good."}
{"text":"portions are massive but this is your standard local wings place. The decor needs updating."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday and the booths we're petty nice.  I can't complain about the service, but the the chicken quesidillas tasted kinda funny.  The wings were pretty darn good.  I would give another 1/2 star if available. BTW Got 9 birdies in a row on golden tee and currently the longest put holder, so that was pretty exciting."}
{"text":"So, on the positive note, I do like the new renovations and the size of their chicken wings... But then there's the negatives:  1. Their sloppy joes is really sloppy... Like all-over-your-plate sloppy. And call it OCD, but when my food looks like that, I can't really touch it.  2. I doubt their sirloin steaks are really sirloin cuts. I'm pretty sure I was given a burger patty disguised with more onions and carrots than one can ever eat. And it wasn't medium rare like I ordered either. I was really excited to see a steak on the menu for $13 something but I guess you do get what you pay for.   3. Anecdote time!!! My boyfriend had ordered bruschetta with cheese. The waitress brought him bruschetta without... Here's how the conversation between them followed: BF: \"Hey, I ordered bruschetta with cheese.\" Waitress: \"No, you didn't...\" And she wasn't even a finger wagging black woman. Just a young white chick with a lot of attitude. I thought she tried to redeem herself when she came around to ask us if our food was okay. And I smiled and lied, \"Yeah, it's great. Can you please bring us water?\" Our glasses were empty. I was hoping she'd just come by and fill them without being asked to. I am used to such luxuries in other restaurants. But instead, when I asked her, she gave me one of those nasty looks that screamed, \"seriously?!\"   I wish I hadn't left her a tip but I was feeling overtly generous yesterday. And I'll probably go back to sloppy joes because of its proximity to my boyfriend's place and convenience, especially for a late night binge."}
{"text":"Hands down best chicken wings I've ever had.  Big, juicy, and the sauce was fantastic.  Service was alarmingly quick.  Server took a bit to crack a smile, but she was efficient.  I will be back again and again"}
{"text":"I went with a couple of my friends recently and we really enjoyed it.  It's a great sports bar with lots of TVs around, pool tables, etc.  If you love wings, this is your place!  They are huge, well-seasoned, well cooked, saucy and they don't skimp out on the carrots and celery like some other places.  I ordered 10 suicide but they were much like hot.  I could only eat three; albeit my friend and I shared onion rings.  Speaking of which, the onion rings were awesome but, unfortunately, arrived lukewarm - my only complaint.  My friend had the Sloppy Joe and loved it, while my other friend had the souvlaki dinner - it looked so good.  The Greek salad had a lot of feta cheese; again, no skimping.   It was a nice atmosphere and the service was really friendly.  I believe they have $0.60 wing nights on Tuesdays and Thursdays.   Rating: 5/5 just on the wings because I'd say it's one of the best in the city; however, I have to deduct a star due to the cold onion rings.  We definitely plan to go back though."}
{"text":"Nice sportsbar.  Food was good, Sloppy Joe's were unique.  Service was pretty good."}
{"text":"I live in the hood and this is the most unfriendly joint around.  Especially the management and tenders.  Food is meh.  Too bad because there are a pile of TV's.  Better pubs either direction."}
{"text":"Wow. This place really fills up fast on wing nights (being Tuesday and Thursday) and thus hard to get seating for a big party. The atmosphere was alright, you can tell this place is optimized to be a sports bar as it doesn't matter where you sit since you always have a TV in a comfortable viewing field.  Since it was wing night I couldn't pass up partaking in the special. At 60 cents a wing you cant go wrong. Your first order is 10 wings and then every order after that only has 5 wings. According to the menu 10 wings is roughly 1.5 pounds. Service was quick where as soon as I ordered I got my wings within five minutes so kudos for that (they were probably cooked in high quantities for wing night). The wings come in four flavors: honey garlic, mild, medium, hot, and suicide. I opted for the mild since it was my first time here and I really wanted to taste the chicken rather then focus on the hot sauce. Anyways, long story short, I could not finish the ten wings I was given. I must add that I was really hungry coming in so its not because I had a small stomach. Even though the wings had a nice taste to them, they were also really REALLY greasy. It definitely didn't sit well in my stomach. Next time I'm coming back here I'll try different than the wings. Do yourself a favor if you're looking for good wings with a greater selection of sauces and go to a dedicated wings joint."}
{"text":"This is the kind of wing joint with very loud 80's music, tvs all over the place showing a hockey game, waitresses in short shorts, mildly drunk suburban clientele and a \"thank you\" letter from the police dept at the front door.  There is no irony at Sloppy Joe's.  Their wings are the kind that are deep-fried in batter.  While I like this type of wing, I got the Suicide wings, which were actually too hot for me.  I misread the place and assumed their Suicide would be mildly hot.  Instead, they were a chore to eat.  This is my fault, I know.  My partner had the hot wings and they were nicely hot with a great crunch.  Unless you're a firebreather, stick to the hot or medium.  Our waitress was chipper and efficient, but I was really disappointed with the customers.  We sat not far away from a Golden Tee golf game, which was attended by three drunk older guys (50's?) who repeatedly swore at and kicked the machine.  They were real jerks, but nobody else seemed to notice their behaviour.  I assume it's \"par for the course\".  The beer taps are Labatt's, plus the standard imports.  Prices are reasonable.  But while I'd never been on that strip of Lakeshore before, I don't suppose I will be again anytime soon."}
{"text":"To be honest, all I ever eat from here is the wings.... --The WINGS --I should actually be spelling it like this, because they are massive. In every which way. The size, the flavour, the crunch... They are just amazing! I usually get mild and or honey garlic.... Either or, off the chain....  As for the place itself, there are always people there, and never seems like a dull deserted place. Lots of televisions to watch, but the music can be pretty loud, actually, almost every time I go, I find it to be a little much, but that won't be nearly enough to stop me from eating there. Tuesday's and Thursday's are wing nights, I highly recommend.!"}
{"text":"The customer service is typical for a bar. I dislike big wings.. mainly because I know they have so much hormone and chemicals and fed wrong.. Chicken wings shouldn't be that big.. but oh my goodness.. when I tried the mild and the spicy wings with extra sauce and how perfectly cooked and flavorful and fresh it was.. I had to give in! This is the only place I will eat huge ass wings and be as happy as a child shopping for candy. I definitely recommend and I am definitely coming back. It's a must. I love chicken wings and if they are cooking it like this, then this must be the way to go? Yip."}
{"text":"Been here twice with a local musician friend. The wings are perhaps the finest I have ever eaten ! Trust me, I have wings regularly and all over North America. These were unreal ! Service is a little up and down. The place is large and clean with classic rock blasting. Not a hipster in sight thank God."}
{"text":"Band was amazing!  Scully and the Crossbones.   Ordered the Greek salad, based on the reviews, it was ok, but not great.   Ordered chicken wings, 70 cents each Tuesdays and Thursdays......choice of mild, medium, hot, suicide or honey garlic sauces.   I chose honey garlic.   Wings were ok, but nothing different from anywhere else.  I guess I expected more based on the reviews!"}
{"text":"Sloppy service, sloppy food, sloppy atmosphere. We will not be back. We've been loyal customers for years, but the last two times we've been disappointed.   The draft Heineken was not cold-strike one. We asked for freshly fried wings and we' were willing to wait. When the waitress came with the wings , minutes after we ordered, we asked  if they were freshly fried, and she said yes, we took one bite of the wings and they were not hot and were dried out- that was strike two and three.   Not impressed and truly disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this place. I think it's the best bar near Humber College. I love their wings. Their wings nightson Tuesday & Thursday are a must. All you can eat wings for a fix price, you cant beat that. If you a small group of 2 or 3 try sitting at the bar, the service is way better."}
