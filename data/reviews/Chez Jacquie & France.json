{"text":"Très bonne place populaire pour un brunch traditionnel. Rapport qualité/prix imbattable. Le service était très rapide et le restaurant assez chaleureux (un air de Gaspésie). Il y a beaucoup de monde, mais on comprend pourquoi !"}
{"text":"Bon, pas cher et bon enfant, que demande le peuple ! J'adore ! Je prends toujours comme brunch le plat : un oeuf et un choix de viande avec accompagnements et café et je suis calée pratiquement jusqu'au souper."}
{"text":"Easy parking, great food, simple and cute interior.

Sadly some of the staff are plain horrible. We were lucky that one of the owners took over our table because we were ready to leave.

Hopefully they will realize this at some point, I read some similar comments before going there and was shocked at how spot on it was.

Example; forgetting parts of the order, serving people who came in after us first, attitude when requesting the balance of the order, etc...

Will be going back, fingers crossed."}
{"text":"Best breakfast joint in Montreal west! I'll agree that the service is lacking, but the food is far from \"sub-par and tiny portions\".  The cretons are amazing."}
{"text":"Restaurant dejeuner ou je vais depuis mon enfance avant quil demenage demplacement. Bouffe tres correct et personelle agreable."}
{"text":"Neighborhood joint that gets by more on the community vibe than the food. Bacon and toast were burnt. Crepes were cold. Saw the woman who handles the cash rearranging food on plates with her hands...after handling money...before serving to the patrons."}
{"text":"Lorsqu'on entre dans ce petit restaurant, on se sent comme sur les îles de la Madeleine. Le menu est super varié avec quelques plats typiques des îles. Les plats servis sont délicieux et de bonnes portions. Par contre, le service est affreux. Les tables sont souvent sales et avant d'être servi par quelqu'un, c'est plus que dépassé. Et les serveuses sont secs, à la limite bête.

J'y retourne malgré tout, car les déjeuners y sont  très bon et à bons prix.


When you enter this little restaurant, it feels like the îles de la Madeleine. The menu is varied with some great dishes of the islands. The dishes served are tasty and portions are great. The negative point is the service. It's awful! Tables are often dirty and before being served by someone, it's more than exceeded. And the waitresses are a little bit painful in their attitude.

I go back anyway because the lunches are great and the prices are also good."}
{"text":"2 stars is generous, the food was sub-par, service was terrible and rushed, portions were tiny and nothing special, i was starving after finishing my plate, all in all we were in and out of there in 20 minutes, not a good experience: why not just stay home, and do brunch yourself instead of wasting your money on this place"}
{"text":"The service here is so atrocious that I had to give 1 star. It'd be unfair if I didn't. It's a shame because the chef is very good. Best French toast around but man, the service. I've been here many times (the French toast keeps brining me back) and every time the service is laughable. Last Saturday my friend and I had to ask for water 4 times. By the time it came we drank it so fast we resembled camels toasting in the sun. No tip for you! Not coming back."}
{"text":"I went there with my 13-year-old son on a Saturday, mid-morning, and it was very crowded. They obviously had a loyal clientele. I'd give it four stars, which to me means good and I'd go there again, but I wouldn't recommend it. Nor would I crave going back there again or make regular visits. A lot of the food was cold. The scrambled eggs were cold and limp like they'd been lying around for 15 or 20 minutes. The french toast was the same. The potatoes, ham, bacon, and sausage was good and the creton was great. The service was pretty good. One girl brought us to our table and refilled my coffee often, although it was a good 20 minutes before my son got his glass of water, which was the only thing he drank. Another older woman took our orders and we had to wait about 15 minutes for her to  do that. I'm not sure why the coffee girl couldn't take orders. I'm not a big fan of baked beans, but my son assured me they were excellent. The staff were pretty friendly considering how rushed they were. It seems to me like a traditional Quebec breakfast place, not perfect, just okay."}
{"text":"J'ai vraiment aime mon experience ce matin chez jacquie & france!!! Un super menu avec enormement de choix. J'ai pris l'omelette Le Grand Gap, delicieux. Les patates etaient superbes et j'etais bien contente d'avoir des cretons avec mes toasts :)
Pas cher pantoute en plus!!!
Le cafe laisse a desirer mais c'est pas bien grave.
will be back"}
{"text":"Parfait pour un brunch simple, copieux et très abordable ! Sur le thème des Îles de madeleine la décoration vous y emmènera!
Service un peu long parfois mais il y a tout le temps de monde !"}
{"text":"Sans doute le resto à déjeuner le meilleur rapport qualité prix.

Mon bémol est au niveau de la rapidité du service et le temps avant d'être servie. Très long très lent. Il n'y a que 2 serveuses pour tout le restaurant. Donc on peut attendre facilement 30 minutes avant de voir quelqu'un à la la table prendre notre commande. Il ne faut surtout pas être pressé."}
{"text":"Delicious crepes!! Good potatoes. Great toasts. Benedict is good. Not too fan of the fruit cocktail."}
{"text":"A good place for breakfast in Verdun. Good food, and it's not expensive. You don't go there for the ambiance or the decoration as it's a simple restaurant, but a friendly one.

There are too many tables in the venue as it's not a big restaurant, so sometimes the place feels packed. It's also a bit hard to go there during the weekend, as it's always full or nearly full."}
{"text":"Food is good and not expensive which is probably the reason why the place was packed. In a busy day the waiting line could be quite long but overall the stuff is well organized and you don't feel left behind. The food is well presented, the cutleries are clean and the waitress comes regularly to refill your coffee cup. A minus for us was to see one of the servers poking the toasts with her hands to check if the toast is hot on the surface. Hard to say if this is a practice or a coincidence since the restaurant does have a plate warmer in place between the kitchen and the room but that day it was off (broken?)."}
{"text":"Super nice staff, my French is poor but they do speak English a little as well if needed. We we were told to sit before the table was cleaned (seemed to be common place) but it was tidied fast, and the food was delicious! Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Great breakfast at a reasonable price. Lots of options and the service is consistently good."}
{"text":"Just a visitor from out of town. Food was wonderful but there was no English menu and some of the servers don't speak English. No vegan options that I could see but ended up having a bagel with jam. The bagel was good but server didn't even bring peanut butter as asked. Bring a friend who speaks French otherwise you won't get much help."}
{"text":"I have a love hate relationship with this place.. Sometimes its amazing.. Sometimes its not.. Sometimes the staff is great.. Other times they're not.. Great portions and the food is generally on point but you can do groceries, cook, eat and do the dishes in the time it takes to get your food... So.. Love hate it is!!"}
{"text":"Salle à manger accueillante, bouffe simple mais bonne. Prix abordables. Un peu déçu du creton, les reste était très bien !"}
{"text":"this place has a pretty good breakfast menu. first off, the coffee is good (if the coffee is not good, I usually don't go back...ever), and comes with refills. the place has a pretty nice atmosphere and a summer terasse. the main reason go is when I am in the mood for the yummy creton."}
{"text":"Went for a brunch and man oh man it was really good !

I live down the street and always seen it and never stopped by untill one day I finally realized it's a cute little breakfast joint.

It's family owned so you'll see lots of family pictures and vacation pictures on the wall. Doesn't matter what holiday is coming up they are covered head to toe with decorations, nice ones too!

Place does get busy so weekends are loud but that's what you want I would feel weird going to a quiet little resto on Saturday morning lol. It takes a sometimes a while to place an order but that's because they're super busy.

Food quality is good, eggs Benedict are my favourite, I always take bacon because the chef in the back does it well done and that's exactly how I like it.

They do have a liquor licence so if you're looking to nurse a hangover with a beer or a boozy brunch with your girls they make fruity drinks. 

It's not expensive about 10 dollars a plate.

Love this place will always be a customer."}
{"text":"You'll have to make do if English is your only language, but it should be fine.  This is the kind of small unassuming restaurant that serves good food without fanfare ... the reason why Montreal is such a fine city for eating out.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Food was okay and service was extremely slow. She was one waitress serving the whole restaurant during a busy Friday afternoon"}
{"text":"Consistently yummy & affordable breakfast. All the standard eggs & meat plates come with creton, toast, beans and fruit or tomatoes. Every now and then you'll get a somewhat stale crepe but it's always just an extra to my meal (not my main order) so not a big deal. They do have some fancier things too like brioche with piles of fruit, etc. I've only ever eaten breakfast here but it's my go-to in Verdun. Usually quite busy on weekend mornings so get there early!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast food at a reasonable price. A nice variety of dishes. The restaurant is very small for the amount of people they stuff in there, so as you can imagine, it gets very loud.

The staff is friendly and competent.

The biggest negative is the fact that they're usually very busy and you may have to wait 10-20mins before you're seated. The times that I've been there, they never seemed to utilize their terrace even though the tables and chairs are set up."}
{"text":"Tried to eat here last week.  Horrible, horrible service.  I actually stood waiting to be seated for mmmmm about 3 minutes while the waitress, the cashier and a customer chit-chatted...with me standing right in front of them waiting for a table.  I finally take a seat and no one even pours me a coffee.  After another couple of minutes, I get up and leave.  I doubt they even noticed."}
{"text":"Ce fut notre première visite à ce restaurant en ce dimanche matin pour le déjeuner.
Nous sommes arrivés vers 9:00 et deja le restaurant etait plein de couples mais surtout des familles du quartier. Nous avons et accueilli par la gentille proprietaire Jackie qui fera tout pour que nous soyons satisfait de la nourriture et du service. Le décor rappelle l'acadie région d'origine de la dame. Quelques minutes suffirent pour que nous soyons assis à une table de 2. Le cafe fut servi rapidement et il est très bon pour un restaurant à déjeuner. Je suis rarement satisfait du café servi. Mon amie a commandé des ufs, bacon, baloney :-). Pour ma part ce fut le Bénédicte florentine extra saucisse et fromage suisse. Tout est possible dans son assiette. Le client est roi. Les deux assiettes furent à notre entière satisfaction. Servies chaudes les assiettes étaient pleines mais un peu plus de fruits auraient été appréciés. Les rôties viennent automatiquement avec des cretons. Les prix sont très raisonnables et je vous conseille ce restaurant au lieu de n'importe laquelle des chaînes de restaurants à déjeuner. Petit conseil. Le dimanche arrivez avant 10:00. Si non, attendez vous à attendre en ligne à la porte."}
{"text":"Verdun's hidden gems! Adorable Acadian Fishing decor on the inside, we got here at 11:15am and it was packed (with about 4 other groups waiting behind us)! 

Plates were not only super tasty but totally worth the price! They have your eggs benny, crepes and eggs, bacon and home fries, yogurt and whatnot. My friend went bananas for their creton! I honestly thought the price was super reasonable for breakfast (my eggs, potatoes, toast, and fruit was less than a fiver... and I had a nibble of my friend's eggs benedict and I really enjoyed their hollandaise sauce!

Service was friendly, tables were clean and refills were not forgotten so overall, I'd come back again!"}
{"text":"C'est certain que j'y retourne pour manger les bénédictines... à l'intérieur. Nous nous y sommes rendus un dimanche matin en vélo. Comme il faisait beau, nous avons demandé d'être assis sur la terrasse. Malheureusement, les tables étaient sales et la serveuse, qui faisait de son mieux, aurait définitivement pu bénéficier d'un coup de main. La pauvre. Malgré tout le service était sympa, mais le déjeuner (deux oeufs bacon, n'était juste pas à mon goût. Les oeufs étaient vraiment trop cuit et le bacon aussi, j'avais demandé mon bacon mou. Généralement je ne suis pas trop fussé sur mes déjeuners, mais là, ça commençait un peu mal ma journée.

Comme plusieurs personnes m'ont parlé en bien de cet endroit pour son service chaleureux, pur sa décoration un peu kitsh des îles et pour les bénédictines, je promets de leur donner une deuxième chance et qui sait, peut-être mettre à jour mon avis!"}
{"text":"Le restaurant a définitivement une ambiance familiale, alors que les propriétaires travaillent tous les jours avec les membres de leurs familles. 
Côté qualité-prix : l'endroit est vraiment de choix . Les plats sont gros, et assez bon côté goût . 

Toutefois, si vous êtes pressés, n'y aller pas ! Le service est très long et vraiment désorganisé."}
{"text":"Showed up at noon on Monday after Osheaga with 18 of my best friends unannounced and we were seated and served within minutes. Eggs were a perfect over easy, bacon was crisp (came with 4 slices!) and even the beans were edible. The toast also came with pâté which was random and not many of us touched, but probably is traditional Acadian fare. The meal did not disappoint, I would definitely recommend popping off here again."}
{"text":"This is one of my local go-to breakfast places here in Verdun. It's not fancy, but it's cheap and good. If you're in the area and need a good breakky, then you should definitely try it out (the more hungover you are the better!).

My favourite is the big breakfast, as it comes with french toast or a crepe (in addition to the eggs, meats, beans, homefries and fruits).

The (filtered) coffee is OK here, but nothing amazing.

On the waffle side of things, I can heartily recommend the chocolate chip ones. The blueberry ones were OK, but great. Make sure you ask for real maple syrup, as they just put that table crap out if you don't.

There's lots of other stuff on the menu that I haven't had a chance to try, so its a good place to go if you want something a little different (it all has an Acadian theme to it)."}
{"text":"Chez Jacquie et France is a little gem located in the heart of Verdun, on Bannantyne Street between 1st and 2nd Avenue. I made my way there with my husband on  Sunday early afternoon after digging up this restaurant on Yelp the night before. We found this small breakfast place to be overall charming and welcoming. Although the decor is very dated (faded photos and paintings of Îles-de-la-Madeleine and a dubious choice of colors for the walls which reminded me of what you'd find at \"chez matante Ginette\", if you know what I mean), I found that the suspended fishing net on the ceiling was brilliant. 

The food was quite tasty and the portions were just the right size, better than what I expected for the price! He had waffles with fruits and I had Florentine Benedict eggs. Thumbs up to the cook for the spices they used on the potatoes; too many times I have been served bland potatoes next to my eggs in other restaurants. But not at Jacquie et France! Although several reviews before pointed out that the coffee was bad, my husband assured me his filtered coffee tasted just fine. I guess it's a question of taste! 

We left pleased and looking forward to the next time. There are few good breakfast joints in Verdun; we are definitely bookmarking this one!"}
{"text":"Atmospere is great. Very welcoming. Food was good, prices very reasonable. A little bit crowded, but not in a bad way. Fast friendly service. Breakfast potatoes where not to my taste, being heavily seasoned and overcooked."}
{"text":"After numerous visits with the same overall feeling, I thought it was time to write something about the very lackluster service and overall unfriendliness. 

It's a little hard to describe, but you feel a subtle sense of snobbery or je ne sais quoi. Very rarely are you welcomed or cared about when you are standing at the entrance waiting for a place to stand - let alone sit. 

Nice they are busy most of the time, but that's no reason to virtually ignore your presence, and kind of embarrassing as the diners sometimes gawk. 

Moreover, last visit was on a holiday long weekend, and they were somewhat short staffed to the point where menus took a long while to arrive (good thing I saw a basket of them), and plates that were ready to serve were piling up on the kitchen windowsill. 

I don't recall getting asked how is everything in either language come to think of it on almost any visit. I will say when one of the main owners is working the floor or the register it's a little better in the respect department.

The good I can say - and fairly consistent - is the food. About a 3 to 4 on most occasions with the creton being a 5. One recent stand out was by chance a yogurt, fruit and nut bowl with honey drizzled over it. Was in a large parfait dish, and even had ripe kiwi. Pretty healthy, and pretty tasty. Too bad I may never go again. 

There are other places in the area that serve brunch and seem much more pleased to have your business, and the food is no worse, so there - that's my peace, and as you can see I'm usually a 4 or 5 kind of positive reviewer - I guess I had to pull up my less than 3 star reviewing socks at some point.

In a nutshell, 1-2+ for service and 3-4+ for food, unfortunately yields 2.5ish for which there is none, so to hopefully get someone to take notice, I'll put 2. Spent enough to say this, and I'm not the only one who's noticed from the various other reviews that note similar service shortcoming etc. Peace out."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late breakfast on Sunday, the place was crowded ( which is always a good sign ). We were seated quickly which was nice and the waitress quickly came around. Thats when things started going downhill.

Neither my friend or I are capable of speaking fluent french, only tits and tats and when the waitress spewed out phrases faster than we could translated with our useless four years of highschool french education, we did the only thing possible and asked if she spoke english. Luckily she spoke enough to ask us if we wanted coffee and after giving our respective answers all was good. 

Until we didn't get service for another twenty-five minutes. In about five we both had decided what we wanted, and closed our menus to indicate that we were ready to order. I understood that the place was busy and it might take while, but our waitress flitted around refilling coffee and chatting with her co-worker for twenty minutes without giving us a single glance. Eventually we were starving and meekly raised a hand to indicate we wanted to order and that was ignored. When we finally did get service our waitress just jerked a thumb in our direction to another worker who took our orders. 

Three stars because the food was actually great, really nice presentation and reasonably priced. I would come here again in hopes for better service on a slower day."}
{"text":"Every time, I'm in Verdun on the way to various places, I always pass this little place on Bannantyne and notice that the terrasse is consistently packed and there always seems to be a hum of activity here.

What also caught my attention was the fact that there's an emphasis on Acadian fare here, something which is a bit of a rarity. One of those places you keep telling yourself, that you have to try sometime and yet never seem to do.

Well thankfully, today a friend and I managed to do exactly that and glad that we did. No need to go to the Plateau anymore for decent breakfasts and brunches. The food here was excellent, portions were huge, service was friendly and prices were very decent for what you get. You'll find all your French Canadian breakfast classics here, eggs, toast, bacon, Eggs Benedict, waffles, crepes, French toast, omelette, baked beans, crouton, etc.

I ordered an omelette called \"La Roque\" filled with Italian sausages, mushrooms, onions, peppers and cheese. I could barely finish it, it was so filling! My friend ordered Eggs Florentine and cleaned off her plate. Both of us waddled out, very full and very satisfied but no doubt also with elevated cholesterol levels!

Not a place that's big on innovation, but does the classics very well. 
I'm definitely going back."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of your \"mom and pop\" type of breakfast place, and this is a perfect place. They have a good breakfast menu and everything is yummy. It is affordable and the staff  is very friendly! Definately recommend for a good breakfast place in Verdun."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast in Verdun. You can't really go wrong with a $5 breakfast that includes two eggs, toast, fruits, beans, and coffee. It's not fancy, but the food is great for the price. The waitresses are always super nice."}

{"text":"Quoi de mieux pour décrire les déjeuner de Jacquie et France que de dire simplement beaux, bons, pas chers. Servis chauds avec des assiettes pleines, presque difficiles à terminer, c'est une endroit où le mot brunch (breakfast + lunch) est très bien illustré.

J'y ai essayé un peu de tout, les oeufs, les bénédictines, le yogourt, les gaufres et les crêpes. La seule chose que je n'ai pas aimé était les gaufres aux bleuets mais je suspecte que c'est le faux-sirop qui a ruiné le goût, plutôt que la gaufre elle même. La fois suivante, j'ai essayé avec le sirop d'érable, et c'était super bon.

Pour moi, y'a rien de plus québécois que de me faire servir des cretons avec mes toasts et de sortir du resto avec un morceaux de sucre à crème qui fond dans la bouche. La seule chose qui manque pour faire de mon expérience à Chez Jacquie et France complète serait d'avoir du sirop d'érable automatiquement au lieu d'avoir à faire une demande spéciale et de payer un extra."}
{"text":"I used to live in Verdun and when we wanted breakfast, this is the place to go to. Family owned, the staff is really friendly. They're from Îles de la Madeleine. Typical breakfast menu but done well. If they mess up your egg, no problem! They'll fix it right up for you. Get there before 12:00-12-30 because tend to get busy fast during the weekend. I guess just like most breakfast place :) It's not a big place but it does hold a terrace! Prices are fairly cheap and portions are big! These people know what they're doing. They've been open for a long time!"}
