The people working here is so so friendly... and more than happy to fulfil my request of: 
- not too much rice 
- extra veggie 
- BBQ pork not too fat but not too skinny 
- BBQ duck leg fresh please (yes he chopped up the fresh duck just for me) 

BBQ pork here is so good, nice and tender and have a hint of honey... the duck's skin is crispy and the meat has a lot of flavours... 

Even the soup that comes with it has veggie inside! Melon and carrots and you can tell they really put the effort in making the soup, not as an afterthought as some places they just taste like a MSG infused brown coloured water! 

For $5.50 it is sizable and I got to share it with my friend and we were both happy! :P"}
