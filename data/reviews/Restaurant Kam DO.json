{"text":"I ordered a plate of stir fried beef and vegetables,  90% of the plate was a big lump of noodles that wasn't even stir fried. So basically I had boiled noodles like spaghetti and a few vegetables that tasted rotten. On top of that, the sauce tasted like cheap cheap soya and had a horrible flavor.  The server was very rude and extremely carelessly impatient, the restaurant was disgustingly dirty. I paid left my plate. And went to eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Honestly, I really loved this place and have been coming here for 10+ years when I was a student at the college. There prices are decent,  there General Tao is on point and there hunan dumplings, lets just say that I stopped to eat here today just to get an entree of dumplings, love them!!!! But today.... I was extremely disapointed. When they  served me the dumplings, the peanut butter sauce was cold. To be honest, its not THAT big of a deal to me and definetely not a deal breaker, so i asked if they can just warm up the sauce a bit..  But then, to my horror, they bring the food in the back of the counter and pop my dish into the Microwave!!!!...The Microwave!!! Instead of just putting it back into the pan and reheating it.  I dunno but that really just turned me off. Now im sitting here with the dumplings back in front of me and i just cant bring myself to eat it.  What a real shame"}
{"text":"This is a great place for tasty chinese, cantonese, szechuan and sushi food around Cote Vertu metro. Prices are reasonable, there's a great selection to eat in, take out or have it delivered.  My favourite has always been the chicken with peanut butter sauce & crispy spinach (my vegetarian girlfriend ignores the chicken and gobbles up the crispy spinach, though you can just get it by itself as an appetizer). Their general tao chicken is also quite tasty. I believe you can get the general tao with rice as a lunch or dinner special. Also very high on my fav list is their beef fried rice Chinese style. Their dishes with red curry with coconut milk & sweet basil leaves and is a good starting point for vegetarians as it comes with tofu or shrimp.  Their portions are very reasonable. 2 dishes alone will be more than enough for 2 people. Order a third and they'll happily provide containers to take food back with you. They offer delivery and takeout as well and portions again are very reasonable. Their fried rice and vegetables comes better with take-out (fried noodles on the bottom and then everything else on top).  If Asian food isn't your top choice for the day or night, I'd recommend Decarie Hotdogs, several stoops down."}
{"text":"The worst delivery food I've ever had. The dumplings were too sweet and dry as if they went from the fridge to the microwave. The chicken, I wouldn't know where to start. The Cantonese noodles, flavourless.  Everything is looking at me from the trash can. What a waste! Look for another restaurant, do yourself a favour."}
{"text":"Seemed like good food with good value , only the next day ended up having food poisoning , ever since they got fined and shut down for health inspections it's all been going downhill from there"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place! I've been eating here since 2007 when I started college and the food is always amazing. The portions are quite large and very worth it for the price (generally $8-$11). The atmosphere inside is warm and cozy, and the staff is welcoming as well. My go-to options on the menu are the dumplings in peanut sauce and their general tao chicken. On occasion, I get their soups to go - and they are very large portions."}
{"text":"Love this place, and have been going for years now.  It's small and cozy feeling in a seriously unpretentious way. Maybe not the place to go on a first date as visually it isn't impressive. But DAMN the food hits the spot every time. The plates are so generous and dirt cheap, about 8-9$/ huge plate.  My favorite is the salt and pepper chicken as well as their hot and sour soup. My friends go wild for their General Tao as well.  This place will forever hold a place in my heart!"}
{"text":"Good food for a great price. I have never been to the restaurant itself but I ordered it for lunch one day at work. The food was tasty and the food came fairly quickly. I really enjoyed their vegetable soup and the chicken with vegetables."}
{"text":"Ordered a \"D\" Combo for delivery. Food arrived piping hot within 30 minutes.  Food that is delivered or taken out normally loses some flavor and texture while being transported. Not the case here. The soup was piping hot. The egg rolls were crispy. The sesame beef with crispy spinach was hot and crispy and delicious.  The chicken fried rice and the peanut butter dumplings were fantastic.  The menu states the combo is for two but we could have easily fed four. Great job Kam DO!"}
{"text":"Above average compared to most chinese restaurants in the area. I usually go for the general tao chicken and shanghai noodles which never disappoint.  The couple running the place never give bad service either. The prices are decent and fair.   Great spot for students nearby."}
{"text":"First thing I have to say is that I always had the food as take out. First thing to say is that the menu is standard for a Chinese place. You can go to other places and you will get exactly the same menu. The taste is also the same as other places. Not bad but nor good enough to stand out from the crowd of Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"You don't go there for the decor,  let me tell you that.  Now that we've covered that,  let's move on to more serious matters.   This restaurant is A. M. A. Z. I. N. G.!  The staff is always friendly.  The food is delicious.  Tastes authentic.  Comes in bulk. And is out-of-worldy cheap. This place is,  without a doubt,  the best restaurant I've discovered in the neighborhood thus far. Will go back,  again and again and again!"}
{"text":"I came to Kam Do for lunch with a friend and I went with their Won Ton soup with main meal of General Tao and Noodles.  The Won Ton ended up being nothing special but I really liked the General Tao and Noodles combination. The sauce was just right! FINALLY!!! Where so many places get it wrong, this place gets it just right. The noodles are perfect for the General Tao as well as the sauce goes down and gets absorbed by it.  It was sweet and spicy without being too much of either. Excellent.  The service was quick and efficient. No complaints there.  The price tag is pretty cheap and for the value you get this place is a solid deal.  Too bad I live too far for deliveries."}
{"text":"Good sized portions, decent food at decent prices. It's a diner atmosphere so it's in and out really. Good location, would stop by again.  edit: they have been using a new noodle for the Cantonese Chow Mein, not a fan."}
{"text":"Ordered the lunch specials ($11.45 after tax) which include a main, a soup and a spring roll.  Delivery was quick.  Spring roll was wrapped too thick and lacked flavor, their side sauce certainly isn't plum and has a chemical taste.  The soup (both wonton and sweet and sour) were passable, lacking a little flavor but still alright.  The general Tao chicken was again, lacking that normal flavor, my concern was more the fact that some of the chicken was still pink. I waited 24 hours but no stomach ache or other issues presented, so long as I'm still posting reviews in 2-3 days then all is fine.  The sesame beef didn't get eaten. Well just leave that there as there's no real term to describe the different colors pieces that exuded \"don't eat me\".  No fortune cookies or chop sticks, but I like that they provide the plastic versions of traditional soup spoons, they were my favorite part of the meal."}
{"text":"I usually order from KamDo,  but since my Lunch changes often I can't leave my desk to go pay do I went today to pick up for myself at 4 other people! The portions are amazing!  They have a lot to choose from, you can't go wrong!  I eat here at least once a week, and The prices are great not to expensive. Watch out for the spicy food they are not shy on hot sauce  When they deliver, they don't always have change so be ready!"}
{"text":"A work friend introduced me to Kam Do a few years ago and I must say it is one of the best reasonably priced Chinese restaurants I have found (I haven't ventured off to Brossard yet but one day I will!).  Don't expect great decor here but the flavour of the food is amazing.  Last night I ordered 3 dishes takeout:  Cantonese Chow Mein,Tofu with Seafood, and Crispy Sesame Beef with a medium steamed rice.  Portions are pretty big.  Most menu items are under $10.  My bill was just over $30 for all that food.  I've heard Tong Por in VSL is the better place to go for Dim Sum but Kam Do rocks the house for some good inexpensive Chinese!"}
{"text":"Had to stop eating here once it got out that they have bad for practises like their fridge being at 16 degrees Celsius and the place being dirty. The health inspectors fined this place at least 4 times already and there's no reason why it should still be open   Stay away"}
{"text":"Good take-out selection (see their website menu). Good prices (average compared to Cotes-Des-Neiges area, but good within Saint-Laurent area) and above average portion sizes. Tasteful food (Canadian Chinese) without overly being salty or oily. Best Chinese place in Saint-Laurent."}
{"text":"The general tao chicken is one of the best i've tasted around montreal.   The szechuan food however, ...is not legit at all."}
