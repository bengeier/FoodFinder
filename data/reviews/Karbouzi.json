{"text":"Karbouzi is by far the best Greek restaurant in this area. High quality ingredients prepared properly. The way they form the chicken around the skewer (large souvlaki dinner) keeps it really moist. Its unique, I had not seen it before. It's slightly more expensive (i.e.pita is extra) then the typical fast Greek restaurant is. But when your craving some Greek comfort food it's well worth it. I have not been to any other Greek restaurant since I found this little gem on orderit.ca last year."}
{"text":"The waitress had quite an attitude. Besides that if you don't know anything about geek food you will probably love this place. If you do, however, you might want to skip it and opt for something else. Nothing has an authentic recipe taste, or even close to it. The best thing was the flaming cheese that the waitress couldn't light but was frankly unapologetic about it. Perhaps the owner should spend sometime in the dining room with his patrons rather than confining himself to the second floor."}
{"text":"I went tonight for my sisters birthday, it was delicious. We were a table of 5, we were a little unsure going into the restaurant because no one was inside (expect at the bar on the top floor). It was reasonably priced food and big portions.   We shared a fried calamari (cooked perfect), large greek salad (lots of feta), pita bread and lamb souvlaki for appetizers. All were good, they had a very tasty tzatziki dip.   I had the stuffed (spinach and feta cheese) chicken breast, it came with steamed vegetables and potatoes. The potatoes were very good and the chicken wasnt dry. They vegetables were a little hard and could be cooked longer. Other people had a soup, pork souvlaki on a pita, pork souvlaki dinner, cod daily special.   There were 5 people eating and we ordered 3 appetizers and 3 beers and the total was around $150. And we had to take some food home cause we were so full. I highly recommend this place to anyone who likes greek food, even the people who dont. we had great wait staff. very good overall!"}
{"text":"There is no denying that the owners and staff are very friendly at this local hangout.  The bar upstairs always seems full of regulars.  I have eaten in once and done take-out twice and found the souvlaki and sides dry and lacking in flavour.  If you are going for atmosphere, it is worth a visit, but if you like your Mediterranean food a little more tasty and moist, there are better places to go."}
{"text":"The food is average at best and way overpriced for what you get. Spent around $80 for two people with no alcohol, could have probably gotten a better Greek meal elsewhere for half the price."}
{"text":"Hot combination plate:  It came with a half skewer of chicken souvlaki, yup, around four bites; they were a bit dry but their yummy tzatziki made it up.  I loved their tzatziki, so tangy and creamy. Then, there was almost half a plate of fried calamari, nothing special, not very crispy but not oily at all.  Dolmades, they were pretty good, I like the flavour; right balance of rice and beef. Spanakopita, they were a bit burned on the edge but the taste was ok. Greek salad was fresh; right amount of dressing.       Chicken souvlaki dinner; again, their chicken souvlaki was a bit dry and small."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently moved in the area and love greek food so after our first experience, we order takeout on the regular.  I must say I am highly dissapointed with their service as the last 3 times my husband has come in to pick up our dinner, the waitresses have treated him like an UBER driver.  They've told him to go to the back instead of the front and pick up food - all of this in a very condescending tone.  I'd figure they wouldn't make that mistake twice let alone 3 times but clearly I'm wrong.  So disappointed as the food is good."}
{"text":"Amazing Food, friendly service. The best greek food in town! Thank you for feeding me!"}
{"text":"I like this place,  but it is a little bit expensive. The taste is very good. The service is acceptable."}
{"text":"I should preference this by saying I don't like Greek food. Or at least I thought I didn't until I was dragged to Karbouzi. First, the decor. I think this is the first time I have ever commented on a restaurant's interiors but Karbouzi is worth mentioning because of the bright blue walls, beautiful lighting and boatloads of positive energy. Walking through the door felt like a mini mental vacation.   My party ordered a massive Greek salad for the table which contained the best feta I have ever had in my life. We also splurged on some equally divine Saganaki. I opted for the moussaka for my entree which was a little bland and ultimately the reason for my four star rating instead of five. Service was lovely. I'm looking forward to coming here again."}
{"text":"Karbouzi Greek Taverna has been a great Greek food spot for me for a few years now.  I fell in love with the food, the service and the warm and adorable foreign interiors when I went to a private birthday dinner party for a friend.   Being a Greek food fan, I could not believe that I hadn't stumbled upon Karbouzi before!  The reasonable prices, the huge selection of food and the great location for us uptown and midtown Toronto folks makes this restaurant a wonderful member of the Greek food places in the city.  The prices at Karbouzi are basically all under $20 for all entrees - minus the Steak, which is only $24!  And trust me, you get a ton for this price! Every entree comes with tons of delicious greek salad, rice and your choice of fries or potatoes.  When I go here for lunch, I love getting a HUGE greek salad and split some greek garlic bread or pita with tzatiki with a friend.   The salad is so fresh and crunchy, with delicious veggies, feta and light greek vinagrette to top it off.  For dinner, I love love love their chicken or lamb souvlaki.  BUT IF YOU ARE VEGETARIAN, do not worry!   They have a delicious dinner plate called a Spanikotiropita! This veggie dish is a phyllo pastry filled with Spinach and Feta! It is to die for!  Aside from my suggestions, there are so many options!   I once counted and Karbouzi has at least 20 options for appetizers alone, both hot or cold!   They also offer a more simple children's menu if you are bringing the younger kiddies along!  As well, this place is such a treat to have a private party or bridal shower dinner at. They are always willing to close up the restaurant to create a much more private venue for you and your guests and they are helpful and flexible with the planning of your private party.  And on top of that, they also cater!"}
{"text":"If you can't make it to the Danforth, Karbouzi is your next best option. Fresh, quality greek food in a convenient uptown location. 20+ years on Avenue...enough said. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"OMIGERRDD I don't even like Greek food but this place is so awesome. My friend and I stopped in here at 10 pm on a Monday night. It was dead, understandably so.  Very cute restaurant, nice clean decor. I ordered the Large Lamb Greek Salad. It was piled high with TONS of crumbly fetta, olives, cucumbers, tomatos, and there was so much lamb! You know how salads are usually barely any of the good stuff (aka meat, cheese and other expensive stuff) I actually finished the lettuce with lamb to spare. That never happens.  And the lamb was seasoned and cooked perfectly.  So tender and delicious.  I never wanted it to end. A little reasonably priced gem."}
{"text":"Karbouzi is one of a few favorite restaurants of my boyfriend's parents, and as a result we go there often.   The ambiance here is pretty predictable - it's basically exactly what you would think if you thought \"Greek restaurant\". It's a well lit place - not a romantic dinner spot - and is definitely family friendly (unfortunately that means there are often young children there, which is not my favorite dining atmosphere!).  The food at Karbouzi is actually pretty decent! We typically order a hummus to start, and it's creamy and delicious - the best part is the warm pita! There are quite a few great dishes on their menu, their ribs are delicious and I'm quite partial to the chicken souvlaki dinner (mmm, tzatziki!). They also have great soup specials - I've never had one I didn't like!   The best part of Karbouzi though, is the unbelievable service. I will note that going with \"regulars\" might skew my dining experience a bit, but they are just so friendly and fabulously attentive. They remember everyone's name and drink order, they always remember how people like things (\"no carrots in your soup, right?\") and are conversational without being intrusive.   Karbouzi is an uptown gem. Definitely worth checking out!"}
