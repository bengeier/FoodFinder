{"text":"The bloody Mary bar for $4.50 is the best thing I've ever had. They had all sorts of options to add to my drink and even my husband's beer was huge and cheap. We sat outside on a clean patio and had great service.. ordered the sampler and it was a lot of food for the price. I believe it was only $13 for nachos, quesadilla, chicken strips, potato skins and fried mushrooms. It all tasted so good. We had been there before and ordered the green chili and it is to die for. We took some to go, ordered 2 round of drinks each and ordered 2 kids meals for my girls and our total was only $46. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Don't go to FuNuGyz on a night when sweaty men beat on each other.. Went tonight. ordered a beer and food for me and a friend.... THEN a guy came around and said we owe $10 ($5 per person) to eat the food we ordered and drink our beers because THEY paid to have UFC on the TV... I don't understand.... I order food and drink in a restaurant and they want me to pay a \"cover\" to eat it because of what is on TV???? sorry.. this is just plain wrong.."}
{"text":"Went here on Saturday night with my husband and his friends and it was OK, nothing amazing, the food was ehhhh but they have good mozzarella sticks, there are TVs everywhere so if you are a sports buff(as I am not) then this would be a place for you, not my scene."}
{"text":"Place is great. No cover ever. They have all sports, including my favorite UFC matches including PPV. Good prices and good bar food."}
{"text":"Incredibly disappointed with what used to be our favorite place to watch football. New owner turned it into a 49ers bar complete with a DJ playing dance music while games are playing. I guess that's what San Francisco fans like but here in Arizona, I prefer to watch football without hip-hop music. We won't be back."}
{"text":"If you like free Texas Hold 'em, Funugyz is the place. They play 2 games 4 days a week. Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday at 6:30pm and 9PM. Saturdays are at 12:30pm and 3PM. Top 3 are awarded bar bucks and grand Tournaments are awesome prizes. Just come in and sign up. Drinks, Food and service is great as well and a great place to meet new people and socialize."}
{"text":"The food is good, but service wasn't. We were there for dinner on a Sunday night. It was dead. It took a long time for the waitress to notice we were there. We placed our order, but what really irritated me was the way the whole experience ended with the bill. We had their $20 groupon, which allows us to have $20 off our bill. The waitress took the groupon and returned with the bill. She only took $10 off.  We waited for about 10 minutes before I stood up and waived at her. I explained the groupon was for $20 off, not $10. She said, \"No, you bought the $10 groupon.\" To which I told her to find the groupon we printed out that says $20 off. The fact that this restraunt is nearly always on groupon with the same deal for the last year or so makes it even more frustrating she wanted to argue about the groupon's value. Then she said after I pointed out of the groupon the value that she would have to check with her manager. I told her to note that the groupon was a month away from expiring. They corrected the mistake, but talk about frustrating. I don't care to go back.   Additionally, if it weren't for the groupon I would never have gone to this place. Their food is way over priced. They charge separately for fries or whatever side you get, which causes your bill be much higher than other places with the same kind of food."}
{"text":"Waiter was disrespectful towards foreigners. Made some ignorant comments. Didn't wait our table. Not a pleasant experience after a 6 hour drive. Will not recommend or return."}
{"text":"I was in the area and needed a drink so stop in .  Cheap good drinks and  bar food. A Nice neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"Always liked this place for a relaxing beer after work, but their wings and mozzarella sticks are awesome. Get the monster sized wings 'dressed' for an extra crispy layer with lots of good flavors to choose from."}
{"text":"I AM NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN! The service in this place is absolutely horrible! I waited 15 minutes before the waitress even noticed I joined my friend's party of 3. My friend waited 20 minutes for a glass of water. It's been 30 minutes and we're STILL waiting on our check. I can't wait to get the hell out of here. She has got to be the worst waitress I've ever seen.  Her customer service and hospitality was non existent.  OH, just now, she was by our table, but flirting with one of the customers and the guy doing the stupid game is way more important...apparently waving at her to come over doesn't work either. The waitress name was Brittany....and instead of getting our checks or cashing us out, she's dancing...wow, how professional. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. Every time is the same. Excellent service. Fast service and delicious food. Very friendly staff and comfortable place to be. Not too expensive either. Obviously, I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Came here 1st time on 11/6 bcuz the bar we initially wanted to go to lost it's liqour license, was closed and we wanted to watch football.  had heard of this place some time ago and thought we'd check it out.  found a table right away, server came right away and we were  pleased with our choices.  got the nickelback chicken tenders with fries, cheese wedges and the pretzels.  the four large pieces of chicken and fries that arrived and the honey garlic dipping sauce I chose tasted great.  the cheese wedges were really good and the soft pretzels good as well.   wanted to watch games again this weekend and brother-in-law wanted to check this place out based upon what we had told him.  Unfortunately our experience was not the same as first time.    We had the same server, who was great again, but the food this time definitely was lacking.  Ordered the wings and chose medium.  Was surprised to see just how large they were when they arrived.  WOW!  Too bad they didn't taste as good as they were presented.  The skin was soggy and chewy and the medium buffalo sauce had a sweet taste, not medium buffalo taste.  Even meat was chewy.  Ick!  Also ordered the Grand Slam which had 3 large deep fried mushrooms, your choice of cheese, chicken (what we got) or ground beef quesadilla, potatoe skins, chicken strips and a small pile of green chili nachos.  if there was anything else don't remember.  potatoe skins were ok, chicken strips were thin, overfried slabs, 3 mushrooms, nothing too exciting, chicken quesadilla was loaded with chicken and somewhat tasty.  green chili nachos just ok, again nothing to write home about.  when server asked how we were, expressed our dismay and she got owner/manager to come over.  told him our first experience there was pretty good but today's experience was very, very disappointing.  he listened and apologized, removed wings from our check and gave each of us drink cards for next visit which was nice of him.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"I enjoy this place because of a couple of reasons. 1) I believe they have quality food. 2) It is a nice clean place and 3) They have nice TV's and they show the UFC fights for free..  Overall, their beer specials aren't anything too great, but they have the typical specials..  Their wings are my favorite, however, they really don't have a wing special which is disappointing... They sell their wings by the pound, so the price varies all the time.  This is my go to bar that isn't a Dive bar because of the overall atmosphere.  I would recommend it."}
{"text":"I've gone here several times with co-workers and family.  I'm giving them 4 stars because they are a happy hour bar, grill and \"ok to take your family to\" restaurantl. I love a place that you can have a good beer, happy hour specials and still be able to take your family to atmosphere. They have the best and biggest fried mushrooms I have tasted.  Right amount of batter without that deep fried taste or oil drippings.  They also have the biggest and tastiest mozzarella cheese sticks (baseball \"bats\") I've eaten."}
{"text":"Stopped in last night for a couple drinks. It was a little slow, probably because it was the day after Cinco de Mayo, but we still had a great time.   There were games in the back to keep us entertained and  the staff was really nice.  I had the buffalo chicken pita sandwich and it was great! Plus there's no cover for the UFC fights, gotta love that!  It's a really cool bar to hang out with your friends and blow off steam from the workday."}
{"text":"Kick ass place not to loud, have a few gray hairs eating there dinner, bit overall it's a fun place for a cocktail and good food."}
{"text":"what can i say. went in there last thursday for lunch. i ordered the the philly. tasted amazing. however, the most amazing part was the barteneder Leticia. she was very friendly and entertaining. she told me she was very new. i recommend everyone to visit her and have some great food. you will be impressed."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food and love the wings for sure service was good it was busy but she took care of us well."}
{"text":"So...our first trip here was AMAZING.  We had the sweetest waitress who explained to us the meaning of the restaurant and how to properly pronounce it.  We called in FUN-YOU-GUYZ...it's actually fanoogeez.  She brought over free shots.  POINTS!!!  So we weren't sure what to order to I order the BLAT.  Bacon, lettuce, avocado and tomato on sourdough.  Amazing.  Hubby orders the nachos (half order) and she brings them to the table and they're about to topple over.  Amazing tortilla chips, GREEN CHILE, chicken...the works.  We joked about the Mexican cooking in the back and how great he did.  She said actually that's a white boy back there cooking.  Well...that white boy can make some awesome green chile.  We go there at least once a week now.  We've had our share of snooty waitresses (like we were interrupting their day) so we stopped going for a while.  Then I started craving their Brunch Burger (burger with an fried egg on top - I get mine smothered in green chile).  Now we have our favorite waitress so we're back to twice a week (with football Sundays).  Things to try:  BLAT, Bruch Burger, FRIED MUSHROOMS, NACHOS, ALL THEIR BURGERS, their Greek salad, their buffalo chicken salad, green chile cheese fries, trio of dips, grand slam platter (Fridays they're half off), their onion rings are awesome.  I have yet to try their wings.  Sat and Sun they have a bloody mary bar.  I've had once.  I was amazed at the stuff they have for their bloody marys.  We go there as a family but they always make my brother leave at a certain timebut I guess rules are rules.  They have UFC fights for free but you better get there early.  Sunday football is packed but so fun.  They have a raffle for football jerseys."}
{"text":"An update is needed as this place has gone downhill. We went for a big UFC fight and while we had a reserved table, when we asked for more seating, we were told the servers were locked out of the storage area. I was scolded by management for keeping door to patio open, while he stood in my way preventing me from entering the bar. The chairs and tables we did have were old and in serious need of repair. Our favorite servers have left and we will likely not return ourselves. We would go two to three times a week for the last 4 years and we were down to once a month if that."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great daily happy hour specials that seem to run longer than most places.  Great for pre drinking or after a night out.    It's rare that a sports bar has such awesome food but myself and my girlfriend love everything we've eaten here.  Highly recommend the thai chicken pita.  So delicious.  The service has always been great when we go.  There are 40 inch HDtv's everywhere.  We counted 24 or so.  Only wish they'd pipe in the audio from the games more instead of music all the time.  Can't have everything I guess!"}
{"text":"This place has lots of choices, but the food wasn't that good. Probably the worst spinach dip ever!"}
{"text":"Decided to try again. Good food but service is still extremely slow and inefficient. Oh and if you try to give them the \"free drink\" coupons you got the last time you were there and waited an hour and a half, read the fine print first."}
{"text":"Love the location, could walk home if we had too!  Used to eat there on Fridays all the time.  Happy hour rocked.  Not anymore.   Last time we were there, food was really bad!  I ordered a fish sandwich and it was just a pile of mush.  Prices used to be decent, but not so much anymore.  We will still stop in on the weekend for a Bloody Mary, but not to eat."}
{"text":"I love this place. Can't go wrong with 3$ Bloody Mary bar, captain crunch French toast.. Megan behind the bar is outstanding.   I don't think there is anything I've tried off the menu I didn't like. Wings are awesome (love their siracha honey sauce) and their chili Mac and cheese is phenomenal. Plenty of TVs and seating. Only downside is they won't play the sound of any games that are on."}
{"text":"The change of DJ on Thursdays has been for the worse...equipment, songs, crowd control, responsiveness when song is missing (never notifies anyone you got skipped cause your song is in my book but I don't have it)...If it wasn't for poker night and the awesome crowd, I would never be there; food is ...meh....they got a new awesome bartender, which brings them to 3-star...barely."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Just got home from there.  We (party of four) walked in at 12:10 and the place was empty.  One man walked in right behind us.  He placed his order before us.  It was 30 minutes later when the one guy's food was served.  The waitress said our food will be right out.  In the meantime, a few more customers came in and she took their drink orders.  She was the only waitress/bartender.  After bringing those people their drinks, she proceeded to take drink orders from another couple that had just sat down.  After 15 more minutes and no food we left.  Luckily, we only had water so no bill to pay/wait on.  We spent 45 minutes waiting for food that still had not arrived by the time we left.  It's baffling to me why it would take that long to cook the 3 items we ordered with no other food orders!  It's also baffling why there would be one waitress/bartender on a Saturday at noon ... maybe she was the cook too!  As we left, we told her we were very disappointed with the service and she seemed surprised we were leaving.  What a waste of time.  Will never go back."}
{"text":"Funugyz used to be the happening place. The service is the worst! My friends and I are regulars here and I swear the service gets worse each week. If it weren't for trivia and supporting Shea, I'd never go back!"}
{"text":"I've been here a lot as it's a mid way point for a group of friends of mine. We all meet up here abt 8-10 a year. Staff is always friendly. Timing could be a bit faster, but we are there on a Friday or Saturday night. Good is pretty decent. Decent pours. Good atmosphere. I wanna go four stars, but I think it's more like 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Poker Poker Poker!!! Free Poker tournaments several days of the week.   GREAT FOOD, the place doesnt look like it but it has GREAT food.    Service depends on who you get,  Rose is fantastic!!!!  Met a good number of Mariners here when training season is on."}
{"text":"Always get texts for 1st  beer free Monday  or free glass of wine Thursday's, but owner Ray doesn't honor shit, he's so tight he squeaks when he walks! Food is o k but nothing to rave about. Pool table is never level cause they constantly move it.My advice skip this place. ED   My son Ryan's there right, says service really sucks, well that's always been the case!!!!"}
{"text":"I've gone here once, my friends have always talked about it and cheap drinks so I gave it a shot. Booths were ripped, furniture was not taken care of and old or damaged, table was sticky I had to ask for a damp towel to wipe off, I was handed one to clean the table myself. I didn't even order food due to the smell and look of the environment, ordered one beer and left. Waitress was nice."}
{"text":"great drink specials"}
{"text":"Funugyz has never been known for fast service but this most recent visit was off the charts. Besides the ripped booths and dirty tables the entire visit to Funugyz was a disappointment. We went in on a slow weekday night and were not even looked at for 15 minutes. Once she abruptly came to our table with menus (after asking for them) it took another 15 minutes to order our food. That's 30 minutes just to get our food ordered! The server was unattentive, and frankly not good at her job. It took about 25 more minutes for our food to arrive and was very disappointing. Unfortunately will not be returning to Funugyz again."}
{"text":"Great food. Wings are huge and tasty. The green chili is also good. Try the chicken nachos with the green chili on it. Yummy! Drinks are made well and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Service was horrible! !  Order 24 wings and didn't receive on drumlet.  My 7 year old sons burger was pink inside.  When I told the waitress it was raw she got smart.  Then the General Manager came by to apologize.  But he was disinterested in my complaint. So why even come over and waste my time.  Then I asked who the owner was and the same manager came back and said he was the owner.  I don't have time for all the games."}
{"text":"I really like this place .... we've been there twice (once during football Sunday and once on a random weekday) and both times, really enjoyed the food and the service.  We just moved from Maryland recently and I graduated from the University of Maryland so I loved our UMD alum server too!  Yum yum wings and there are PLENTY of TVs throughout the restaurant, including TV & sound on their outdoor patio.  I would definitely recommend; however, if you're going for football, go early to guarantee yourself a table."}
{"text":"We have been going here for a while... Then a groupon came up for FuNuGyz so I purchased it because we were heading there with a party of 3. We get there and I show them the groupon and they say they can only honor it for parties of 8 or more... I must have misread the groupon!!!! So we were just going to cancel with groupon and get my money back... but we couldn't. Now I'm sitting here with a groupon that I can't use that I already spent money on!!! Needless to say I am frustrated! Now this is where this business goes above and beyond... They talk with us and I tell them I can't cancel the groupon so they HONNOR the groupon!!! No questions asked! FunNuGyz is definitely here for their customers! :-)"}
{"text":"I wished that I could give it ZERO stars!!!! This place has really gone down hill!! Went there again, foolish me....The toilet in the women's restroom is not working and has not been since the last time I was there, and it smells up the whole place!!! they stopped doing any kind of food specials for Happy Hour which was the main reason to go. Now only drink \"Specials\" so no big deal. Not sure what this place is good for except a demolition. The booths were falling apart the last time there, so instead of fixing them, they just took them out. Now your options are a bar, hightop, or low table---not much for comfort. and the tables rock and spill your drinks////what the Hell. Better off closing the place, too bad cuz it used to be good."}
{"text":"Do not expect anything from the servers. Waited 10mins just to be served drinks and another 20mins to have our food ordered. The environment and energy of the bar was restricted, flat and UNINVITING."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE! Definitely will NEVER be back here. Waiters were so unprofessional and slow! Food and drinks took almost an hour for only a party of four! No thanks. Won't ever be back here!"}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour with some friends after work a couple of times.   The service was great,  the atmosphere was pretty cool and the food was better than expected. The specials are decent - they give discounts to all you teachers out there on Tuesday nights.  If you are looking for a chill sports bar to watch some games, eat some bar food and hang out with some friends I would definitely check it out :)"}
{"text":"this place has a laid back atmosphere (more like a sportsbar) but has very good food. Huge portions. The wings are awesome, huge and tons of flavor no matter which of the over a dozen you try. Boulder Gold and Coconut Thai are two of my faves, dressed and crispy. The sandwiches and burgers are killer too."}
{"text":"Blah!!!!!! Used to be Funugys. Now Legends??? Stupid. Menu has changed and it sucks! They had the best chicken sliders ever. You could order either grilled or fried. Well, guess I'm done coming here. One look at the menu and you can see their only in it for the money. Terrible. Typical B. S. Bar food."}
{"text":"I wish there was an option for zero stars. Our drinks were never filled by our waitress. They were filled by another waitress. Our waitress did fill one drink at the table while mine sat empty. We had chicken strips. They didn't taste horrible but they wee very thin. We told the waitress the burgers was small (1/4 of the bun) she said thy were all like that. The other waitress shook her head and said the manager would come talk to us. The manager never came and the new burger we expected never came. I never send something back but would expect a more gracious host. I will never go here again."}
{"text":"Ordered food never got it. Server was dumb white girl. She writes stuff down and still can't get it right. Then made unnecessary additional charges. Hope she goes back to school"}
{"text":"The food was good for the price. The service from our primary server, who was on her third day of training, was not good.  It seemed like it was her first day of serving, ever...and she acted like she was there doing a favor for someone.  She was nice when she came to our table but did not have a clue.  She walked by our table at least a half dozen times after our food was served and never even acknowledged us.  Her trainer was friendly and did what she was suppose to do (except follow up on her trainee). The other two servers at the restaurant didn't seemed too interested in their work.  They seemed to just go through the motions. There are plenty of tv's, being that it is a sports bar, and every seat had a view of at least a couple of tv's. I have found that the music at most sports bars is either perfect or loud.  The music at Funugyz was on the loud side, especially since about 20% of their customers looked to be at the retirement age (it was Tuesday late afternoon - they probably have a younger crowd as it get later). It's not a bad place, but it's not the type of restaurant that I would visit again."}
{"text":"Horrible service. I waited for my server for more than 20 min. I finally walked up to the bar to get my drink.  When I returned to my table, the server never showed. I just finished my beer and left."}
{"text":"Man...Talk about great Management! While I sat at bar enjoying a couple beers. I noticed the manager walking around to make sure everyone was having a good time. That type of gesture just doesn't happen anymore with business. It's good to see!!  The atmosphere here is very entertaining. Plenty of LARGE flat screen TVs all around to watch. Music is very hip and up beat! They have a digital juke box, that allows you to select the music you want to play.   The food here is really good considering it's a sports bar. I recommend getting the sampler platter. Plenty of food for 3 or 4 people. You will be glad you tried it!  This location is very convenient right off the Hwy. 101 and Thunderbird Rd."}
{"text":"Don't bother-Really bad service-Really BAD food-Wobbly Chairs-Wobbly Tables-why is this place open?"}
{"text":"My dad and I decided to venture out of our normal comfort zone and go to this place.. Walk in the door, no greetings, no \"hi how's it going\", nothing. We sat ourselves at one of the high top counters by the pool table so we could play a game or two. Five minutes go by, still no \"hello\", no menus, no drink orders. We started playing a round of pool, during the game we even made eye contact a few times with a couple different waitresses, none of them came over. 10-15 minutes in, still no service, a couple sits down at a table close to us, service was almost immediate.. Although saw them complaining about the extremely wobbly table. 20-25 minutes later, we ended up getting through two full rounds of pool with !!ZERO!! service. Confused why we didn't get served? Especially when the place was not busy whatsoever? Ended up walking out, no goodbyes or anything... Safe to say we will not be returning."}
{"text":"If someone ask you, \"have you been to FuNuGyz's yet\" you should say one of only two things; 1) \"why yes I've been there, it's a really great sports bars with really good food!\" or 2) \"nope, can't say I've been their but after reading this Yelp review I can't wait to go!\"  I know what your thinking, ok this is yet another sports bar place that \"claims\" to have good food.  But this place has fresh food food prepared daily, none of that day old ~ frozen stuff served here as you'll find in most sports bars & restaurants throughout the Phoenix Metro.    For starters, the service was terrific! Amanda was one of the best servers ever, very attentive and helpful. This place is very clean and has a great ambiance.   One of my colleagues order the Gilled Mahi Mahi Taco's.  He said they were very good and filling.  The waitress stated they have 99 cent fish tacos on Friday's, so I know where to find him now on Fridays ;-)  My other co-worker had the Fat Boy ~ the name says it all.  It was a burger covered with blue cheese, veggies and BACON! It looked very good as well.  Someone recommended he get the Fat Boy and he loved it.   I had the the Fatty Melt ~ carb loaded burger that had \"deliciousness\" written all over it!  Check it out; it had a good, not great but good (needed more seasoning) burger topped with sauteed onions between TWO GRILLED CHEESE sandwiches! Oh yeah! You get to choose how you want your burger cooked and what type's of cheeses and toppings.  I chose their homemade chips, which I highly recommend over their fries! They are yummy!  I could not finish my Fatty Melt and chips, only ate half.  I would order this again in a heart beat (that is if I still have a heart beat after eating this burger) but share it with someone.   It's a great place to watch sports and hang out with your friends.  They have several specials throughout the week, so ask about them when you go."}
{"text":"Great for UFC fights & $1 taco Mondays.  However, since new management has made changes to the menu same items different combo's or lack of... U still pay same prices for items such as burgers and all their sandwiches don't come with fries anymore same price.  Quality well isn't as good.    Staff is  great but most nights they are way understaffed and it takes forever!!  Still average better service then others in the area..."}
{"text":"As a Nebraska Husker fan, finding a bar that welcomes us is like getting Xmas gifts early! Good food, decent wait staff, great drinks. Karaoke night is a blast!"}
{"text":"Good place to call a dive bar.  Good selection of beers, they have a schedule of things to do which includes poker and live music. Believe it or not, food is decent! Owner was way cool, came out and bought our beers because slow service. Did I mention they do a bloody mary bar on Sundays?"}
{"text":"Came here because of the reviews I found online. Said it was a good place to watch the Arizona Cardinals game. Turns out that's pretty spot-on. Food's pretty good for a bar setting and turn on the game sound which is awesome. Prices were pretty good too."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food and service is amazing!! Dayna, Tish and Rose are amazing! Thanks Ray!!"}
{"text":"Living on the \"other side of the mountain\" depended on Yelpers and other reviews to find a casual place to go to watch the game and get a bite to eat near Glendale.  FuNuGyz did not disappoint! Lots of TV screens, great wings (which they even grilled for me!) and the beer was ice cold! Poker games going on in the back, Trivia and sports going on the TV's and Karoake starting right after end of game! Appreciated they held Karoake til the game over (ended late....which some places refuse to do) and even servers who were not assigned to us stopped by to see if we needed anything! YEA! :) Bathrooms large and clean, atmosphere casual and friendly and able to see multiple TV's from every angle! Thanks yelpers for the reviews...you never let me down! :) Will DEFINATELY go back .... when I am on that side of town!! :)"}
{"text":"I really like this place. For one, I used to live really close to it, so, it was my place to go for football games, wings, or to just grab a beer. Well, this place has really never let me down. I don't go there as often anymore because I live a bit too far to justify the drive, but, I do recommend going there if you ever need to catch a UFC or other sporting event. The atmosphere is fun and the service is above average.  I personally get their wings because they are really good. The asian bbq are my choice. They are bigger wings and they serve them by the pound. Happy hour specials aren't bad either."}
{"text":"This place has been one of our favorite places to eat, drink and watch the games. Their happy hour is great with $2 wells and $2.50 drafts. The burgers and wings are pretty good. The breakfast is pretty decent and the weekend bloody mary bar is the best way to start a Sunday morning while watching football. We will definitely be coming back many more times."}
{"text":"Came for Sunday football. Understaffed we waited 30 min for a beer. Sound system was not working so the whole first quarter we had silence. Then when we order waitress said menu changed this morning so half of the menu is not available. Really?! Never coming here again. Horrible management."}
{"text":"Good food, found them on IDine. Lots of TV so great sports bar but I was trying to have a conversation."}
{"text":"I love coming here, but the service is terrible.  Food is always decent.  It would be the perfect place to hang out with a group, if you can get them to serve you."}
{"text":"FuNuGyz is my new go-to spot for lunch in the west valley.  The burgers are excellent, but my favorites are just about anything that comes out of the deep-fryer.  They have awesome homemade fried mozzarella - you must try it!  Service is generally good and the beer is cold.  What more could you want?"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Started coming Thursday nights for Karaoke and the regulars are very friendly and fun.  The venue of singers ranged from bikers to soul crooners.  Very cool.  I had the fish sandwich late and it was fantastic.  Although they had no tarter sauce the chef brought me relish and mayo to mix with hot sauce.  I'll be going back tonight."}
{"text":"Just went in for a drink and had some friends from Oregon, because the server couldn't comprehend that people from other states do visit we were denied the ability to recieve service. She was rude and forced the business to lose some valuable service. If this is the way the business is ran I feel bad for the owners. A buddy asked if ahe was having a bad night she scoffed and disagreed to it, but continued to be rude. As a former service employee I know what they are talking about and the manner of what they are talking about but the beauty of it is they will never earn my business as well as many people I know.   I have received bad service at many places but I am upset that it had to happen at a place I frequent."}
{"text":"Good food... HORRIBLE SERVICE.! Didn't seem busy. Never got one refil- I asked for a fork and did Not get one till after I was done eating with my hands.. Food took a loooong time to come out. Hubby ordered unlimited chips and salsa and didn't get any refills on that and the one that did come out took a good 10 min. We only ordered pretty quick 4 meals that should have come out quick but took a good 35 min.... :/ not going back there"}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars just for the \"make your own Bloody Mary bar\" !!! Sweet love.. Or spicy I should say!"}
{"text":"Lots of hate on here Don't expect the Four Seasons FuNuGyz is fine  Lots of one stars on here.  FuNuGyz is at least a three IMHO.  Been going for several years now.  The beer selection is not huge, but they are very well set up for football Saturdays and Sundays.  Tons of TV's, and they are more than happy to change any of them to whatever game you are interested in watching.  Today, there were Bears fans, Cardinals fans, Steelers fans and this Vikings fan.  Luckily, none of those two teams were playing each other.  Several of the reviews on here have talked about the ownership/management change.  It does seem like the menu is different since I was here last in April.  I think the menu used to be more extensive, and there was a Sonoran Dog that I had in April which was AWESOME and is no longer there.  However, the Philly I got today was solid.  The service was also great.  The bartender remembered me from the last time I was there in April!  Super attentive and friendly.  Beers were on auto-refill until I cut her off.  I'll be back next time I am in AZ!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I stopped in here for dinner.  It's very industrial with the open ceiling and poured concrete floors.  When you walk in - the bar is to the right (no room at the bar tonight).  Behind that is a few rows of high tops of varying sizes.  Behind those are regular tables for four, but, could easily be put together to accommodate a larger group.  And finally come the booths which is where we sat.    They have buzzztime trivia so we ordered a happy hour libation and a game box each.  Hubby's beer was $2.50 and my Chardonnay which was quite nice and a generous pour was $3.  The menu included many appetizers and then burgers, sandwiches, salads and soups and that's all I remember.  Hubby had a burger and said it was quite good although he was not a fan of the bun.  I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich which came with swiss cheese, tomato, red onion, lettuce, and avocado.  The bread was fine but the chicken was a little on the thin side and the tomato and avocado seemed a little over ripe for my taste.   However the French fries were fantastic!  They came with a little cup of ranch dressing which was just the ticket.  They were crispy, great consistency and had a little bit of a peppery zing to them.  Very nice!  We finished off the order with not a morsel left!  We played three games of Countdown and hubby came in #1, #2 and #6 on the local board and #1 in the country on the last game!  Yeah - fun to play with a smarty pants!  There were about 21 flat screen TV's  so every table had a good sight line.  They were very accommodating in changing one of the TV's for us to trivia.    Service was good and friendly.  We'll definitely go back - there are some grilled chicken sliders that are beckoning me."}
{"text":"Went here on a groupon for party of four, first off they were understaffed on our vist. and after she received groupon we were told that there would be an 18% tip automatically added. Food was so so  wont return personally."}
{"text":"It was our mistake to take our 5 year old there for dinner after swim class.  Not our fault the food was mediocre.  Service was ok but this is really a bar not a family place. We won't return."}
{"text":"Funugyz has the worst servers. The servers are rude and do not enjoy there jobs. Do not go here it will be a disappointment for the experience."}
{"text":"Great food, selection of  beers and service keeps me coming back. Try the the Poncho Villa (aka: Mexican Hamburger)."}
{"text":"I have a love/hate relationship with this place. Each time I've been, I've never had a good experience staff-wise. Be it being ignored over other parties for a good 20 minutes after seating ourselves or getting jipped on a take out order to just plain rude service. But good lord do they have really great food. I love \"bar food\" and being a Vegas transplant it's hard to find here in the valley. Green chile, chicken strips, burgers, the trio dip... Man! I just wish they'd retrain the staff."}
{"text":"I LOVE FunuGyz!  It's one of my favorite bars in the area!  Food is great, and they play awesome music!  During the week, they usually have classic rock going, which makes my heart super happy.  As far as the food goes, it's fairly decent for \"bar food\".  I love that they mail 1 cent coupons for beer!  Keep 'em comin!"}
{"text":"Sat down and no one came to greet us at the table. Had to get the manager after about 10 mins of waiting.  Food was okay, manger came back to check on us which was really nice.  Will have to try it again when they are a little bit more busy, as there was may about a total of 15 people there and about 2 or 3 waitress beside the manager who was tending bar there."}
{"text":"Stopped by again, hoping things would have gotten better. Sat in a half empty bar for 10 minutes and left without even a glance our way. No \"hello\". No nothing.   I just noticed that Yelp kept my review at 5 stars. Should be ZERO, but I con only go as low as one..   And please check out my updates below."}
{"text":"I had not been in this place in a while and decided to try it with my boyfriend. We sat down and waited and then waited for a waitress to take our drink order. However, there were plenty of people at the bar and managing other projects that obviously worked there. No one bothered to help with customer service.  We got the 1 beer and water and while we waited again for a very long time to order we decided to try some place else. The beer on tap was lukewarm."}
{"text":"Daytime drinker?  This is your place.  Newish, clean bar that has a somewhat sportsbar feel to it.  Menu is diverse with breakfast all day, the usual pub fare for apps & entrees, and their taplist (thankfully) includes at least one Arizona beer and Murphy's Irish Stout.  Service was very friendly - the sort that involves a friendly look in the eye, handshake, and \"hello my name is... welcome, and what can I get you to drink?\".  Mozz sticks/wedges were homemade and simply one of the best examples I've had in years.  The breading is crumbly, herbed, and similar to what you might expect on fried chicken.  Homemade potato chips were ultra thin and crispy, though somehow they retain a large volume of grease.    A healthy mixture of people were here for their daytime drinking.  Both white and blue collar folks, mostly younger, but there was also a retirement aged ladies table having a great time.    I would have appreciated more happy hour savings for being there at that hour but the nice atmosphere and service was worth it.  I've never been here at night when it could be much busier."}
