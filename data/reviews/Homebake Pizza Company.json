{"text":"We tried this via the Groupon deal, and we're certainly glad we did! We aren't big on home preparation--too much planning and thinking ahead required--so places like this are great. Sure, it's a bit pricey, but the premium ingredients and yummy freshness made it a really fun alternative to takeout pizza when we want to spend a quiet evening chez nous!   We couldn't decide what to try, so we had half and half. The brie and thinly-sliced ham on one half, and the spicy salami and mushrooms on the other (sadly, I can't remember the catchy names they had for each of these). We added jalapeno sausage to the latter half, for some extra kick. Yum! They were both delicious, the service was friendly and in all it was a really pleasant experience. We'll definitely be back. I hope they're around for a good long while--there's road construction along Roncie, so I fear that this is probably hurting a lot of the fabulous businesses along there, unfortunately.   It's worth noting (because sometimes establishments can have misleading names, after all!), that it's not an eat-in place at all--so don't go in expecting an eat-in alternative. They prep it and send you home with it to bake. So, there's some seating for while you wait for your pizza to take home, but that's it."}
{"text":"I love ordering pizza from here when I'm craving fresh, homemade pizza just like my cute Italian aunts used to make.   A lot of people complain that the pizza is over priced considering you have to bake these pizzas yourself... and it's not cheap (about $20 large pizza)... but they're  made on thinly rolled dough, so they bake very quickly, and it tastes much better than any other takeout pizza place . It's also great if you're having guests over because you can pick it up ahead of time and wait until your guests arrive to throw it in the oven.   I've ordered The Purist - which comes with tomatoes/basil/mozzarella, and The Villa - a grilled veggie pizza with zucchini/sundried tomatoes. I loved both,Excellent tomato sauce - fresh Italian herbs, garlic. And the crust is nice and light. If you're not a big cheese lover, I'd probably ask for half the amount of cheese on the Purist - it comes with grated and fresh mozzarella, and the cheese was literally pouring off when I sliced it.  They have four different types of dough to choose from - unbleached white, multigrain, spelt, gluten-free, and three sauces: tomato, garlic, pesto. You can build your own pizzas or choose one of their options.   They also have some salads - but I've never tried them... And free delivery to High Park area."}
{"text":"They have great, thinly rolled dough and fresh toppings but it's pricey for having to go home and bake it yourself.  If you're looking for fresh baked pizza, I think next time I would order a basic pizza with sauce and cheese, then just drop by the grocery store for the rest of the topping.  Or, if you've got extra coin, maybe splurge for their premium toppings like caramelized onion (yes, it was delicious!) because that's obviously harder to get last minute.  I do have a beef with their cooking instructions though. The pizza comes on cardboard and baking parchment.  The instructions tell you to slide the pizza with parchment (no cardboard) directly onto the oven rack.    The dough, however, is so thin and floppy that we found it drooping between the rails of the oven rack. Cheese was falling everywhere! Plus the parchment had a hard time just sliding off the cardboard.    In the end, we just stuck the pizza and parchment onto a baking tray and it turned out fine."}
{"text":"This place is great - I love that it's easy to pick up, made of GREAT ingredients, and comes out of the oven tasting great.  You can't beat it.  My only comment, it's a bit $$ and it would be nice if their menu offered just a bit more than pizza."}
{"text":"I too used the Groupon deal to experience this pizza place. I customized my own pizza with the spelt crust, goat milk mozzarella, and artichokes and olives.   To be honest, I found the toppings a bit pricey so when I got home I loaded it with more veggies and things from my fridge.   The pizza was delicious!! I highly recommend the goat milk mozzarella cheese instead of the regular. Very tasty."}
