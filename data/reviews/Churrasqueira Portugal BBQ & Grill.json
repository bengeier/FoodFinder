{"text":"Love the chicken!  It's definitely the best item, which keeps me going back!  I did have some roast beef (not the stew, I haven't tried that) that was also quite good although I don't see that option there too often.  The portions are great, the price reasonable, the food good, the service quick and overall it's a good experience for eat in or take out.  I do wish they had more side options with more flavour though.  You're in starch heaven if that's your thing, but for the rest of us, the salad and cooked veggies they often have are okay but plain.  If you're taking out, getting a whole chicken with 1-2 sides is a great value.  The windows and surfaces look clean even if the decor is average.  It also looks like they do maintenance regularly when they're closed on Mondays."}
{"text":"Had both the grilled and rotisserie chicken and both are very good. Great value for the money. A must try!!"}
{"text":"Just the best  always busy service at times can be slow small eating area a must visit takeout is the best  way to enjoy"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best rotisserie chicken in town, The chicken is juicy and perfectly marinated with just the right amount of salt and seasoning. The reason I didn't give the restaurant a perfect score is that the other food items on the menu such as the bbq ribs, potato balls, or fried fish were good but didn't exactly amaze me like the chicken did. Overall I'd say that the rotisserie chicken was awesome and worth traveling across town for."}
{"text":"Great chicken. Just get the chicken with potatoes. Funny staff for giving me a hard time for asking for vegetables lol.

Honestly, had piri piri chicken at many places and this is gem in the rough."}
{"text":"Our family has been going to Portugal for a couple of years now after a family friend stumbled upon this joint and highly recommended a visit. I have ordered from them for various parties that I've had my department at work.

I love the fact that It's a mom and pop joint that helps local business. 
The owners and their daughters all work here; they're super friendly.

Extremely reasonable, you get bang for your buck.
The food here is very palatable. Their chicken is delicious ... sure beats Swiss Chalet any day.
Everyday there's a special feature on their menu whether it's ribs, soups, or chicken skewers.

After 6 PM, it's free to park in front of Portugal on Eglinton Avenue.
During the day, you can find parking on side streets.

Churrasqueira Portugal rocks my socks -

A solid four star !"}
{"text":"I love Portuguese food and Portuguese people but this place is disgusting, I saw one day the manager picking up garbage and recycling food, worse restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best chicken I've ever had. Quick Service, fresh chicken. And great every single time."}
{"text":"Mostly takeout restaurant with some seating. Good Portuguese chicken but baked fish was rubbery. Dining area was very warm to eat in and bathrooms were out of hand towels. This was our first visit and will try again."}
{"text":"We just love the flavour of the chicken. Very well seasoned!! The portions of rice and potatoes  are huge!! We have also tried the fried fish and it is phenomenal!! Can I give a bonus star because they are right across the street from Us?:) In about two minutes I have take-out in my hand and in three minutes Im back at home ready to eat!! I guess I cant give convenience points!!::))

If you are in the neighbourhood, give this place a try. 

You can also eat in if you dont live across the street::))"}
{"text":"I have to give this place 4 stars for sure! I've been to this little spot numerous times and every time, the food is as good as the first! The chicken is so savory and delicious, I have too agree with the comment  above stating it's better than Swiss Chalet! The staff are very friendly and I'm happy to live close by, and as a regular here, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone if rotisserie is what you're looking for!"}
{"text":"From the moment walk in, you feel the authenticity in the environment. The food is steaming hot, freshly cooked and the employees are extremely genuine and friendly. To top it off the food is marvellously delicious. 
One point, unfortunately they don't take credit card but that wasn't enough to knock them down a star."}
