{"text":"The best place for brunch,lunch, and dinner. Everything is so so good. Half salad & half panini is my favorite. The mixed green salad with chicken is a must. All of the staff are always friendly and the interior is artsy and clean. The inside is always loud though so if it's too hot to sit outside you're kinda stuck."}
{"text":"The food is very good but the piped music is so loud it is difficult to have a conversation. We went for brunch and loud music on a Sunday morning was nerve-jangling."}
{"text":"The menu is a nice size and has good variety. The food is fresh, and there are some organic options. The service was attentive. I would recommend this as a great breakfast and lunch spot."}
{"text":"If you are going to say over the phone you don't take reservations then don't say you can't accommodate a big group and turn them away when they show up. Especially for for a birthday event! Good food but this is unacceptable customer service."}
{"text":"We had my sister's bridal shower here last Friday night (August 12) and loved it other than the manager on duty. The servers were absolutely amazing and so accommodating, but the manager was extremely rude. He seemed annoyed that we were having our shower there, and was not accommodating about absolutely anything. When we asked him if we could get service because we hadn't seen a server yet, he told us that we had been coming and going too much and he didn't think we should be allowed service until we would finally all sit down. He wouldn't let us put decorations down and was extremely annoyed that we came earlier than our reservation, even though we just wanted to wait, we weren't expecting to be sat early. Once we were done dealing with him though, everything else was awesome. We had two female servers who were great, and one male food runner or busser who was also amazing. Definitely recommend this Postinos location other than the manager who clearly needs some help in customer service."}
{"text":"Food is great, drinks are great, prices are great, bartender and service were Awful. Took over 10 min sitting at the (Not full) bar before even getting a hello and bartender proceeded to act like serving us was an inconvenience to her. Made us very uncomfortable. If I went back and it was the same bartender, I'd definitely walk out and go to another of the 100 great establishments close by. People sitting on both sides of us expressed the same frustration. Aside from this (fixable) issue, happy to see the new Postino in swing!"}
{"text":"My bridal shower was hosted at Postino Highland and I can't say enough good things about the space, the customer service (especially Chris!), and the food. Highly recommend this place to anyone whether you're celerbating something special or just grabbing dinner!"}
{"text":"Incredible. I love a good wine, my husband loves a good beer. This place provided both. It was a suggestion from an old friend who used to live in Scottsdale. We're from Tucson, here on a short weekend trip. Our visit to  Postino was delightful. We were greeted promptly, seated quickly on a Thursday night after 8:00pm. Our host was quick with waters then he offered a couple of solid suggestions on appetizers and beer. He then gave us time to browse the menu. After ordering, our meal arrived quickly.   Here's what we ordered and here's why I crave this place long after we'd gone home: We shared 4 options from the bruschetta board. Keep in mind you get to pick 4 types, and each comes with 4 slices in it. The bread is soft and flavorful. We chose: Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil (very fresh tasting!), Warm Artichoke Spread (I still dream about this), Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomato (the bacon didn't add much flavor, but still good), and finally Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese. That last one is the one I'd drive 120 miles just to taste again. These guys have this down to an art, and we appreciated it. My husband also ordered their Chicken & Mozzarella panini. The bread was fluffy and crispy at the same time. He said the sandwich was great and the flavors really worked well together.  The music made us laugh, 90s pop, the staff was dancing to it. The decor was fun (old wine labels). The food was a pleasure. We'll be back next time we're in town."}
{"text":"This is the third time I've been to Postino and the third location. Staff is consistently friendly and welcoming.  I was in Scottsdale on business so I dined alone or I would have ordered more bruschetta. The variety is awesome and everything is tasty.  I had the shaved Brussel sprout salad and one bruschetta - fig jam, brie and apple. So yummy! I really enjoyed the honey cucumber lemonade - so refreshing.   I will definitely visit a Postino every time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, and great wine selection! The ambience is perfect for a casual night with friends or a first date. Just moved to Scottsdale a week ago and have already been tw"}
{"text":"I went in on Friday night to see what this new location had to offer.  Greeters at the front door were super upbeat, fun, and welcoming.  As you enter, you're instantly attracted to the fun interior with over 1,000 matchbooks on the wall, how cool?!?  We were sat almost immediately and greeted by McKenna.  She was personable yet calm.  She recommended a great bottle of French wine that I normally would not order and I'm so grateful that she did.  I love their bruschetta board and decided to branch out and follow her recommendations.  I tried their Red Pepper Gouda soup- amazing!  She also recommended I try their seasonal cauliflower bruschetta.  Another great suggestion.   The manager, Chip, gracefully touched our table to ensure that we were all enjoying our experience.  I'd definitely recommend this location for a fun, easy going night out... Or even brunch on Saturday!  Thanks Postino Highland."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great interior design, good wine selection, awesome prices, great bar staff and amazing cheeseboard. Visiting from LA, it was the Whipped Cream on the Frappe, the Cherry on top of the milkshake.  European inspired with just enough American Touch to it. Wish we would have found this place before our last day. Nice and clean restrooms.  Will be back here next time when in AZ."}
{"text":"Postinio's has the most delicious mozzarella chicken sandwich that it is addicting. Don't know what I would do without it. Everything about this place is amazing! Will definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"This location is VERY hit or miss. I find that every time I sit in the restaurant area, the service is attentive and friendly.  As someone who does my work out of the office, I often come to the bar though to sit and enjoy a glass of wine as I work. I prefer to come in between their rush, and understand that service tends to be more scarce during these hours. However, the bar service is ALWAYS slow. I have never had attentive service here, even if I am one of three people here. Their attention always lies in their fellow serving staff and NOT in their clientele. Just a tip from a fellow industry member: spend less time splitting your tips while customers are there and more time attending to them-your tips will be higher."}
{"text":"Not a stranger to Postino, but a newbie to this location. Quality of food and service is consistent with their other locations. Very great location for this area, and parking was easy. Nice patio too! Only had their bruschetta plates, and they are AMAZING I've had all but the Salmon and the ones with Goat Cheese due to allergies. I love sending my guests, clients, friends and family to Postino!"}
{"text":"Stopped by last Monday for their board and bottle night and had the most pleasant experience thanks in part to our incredibly knowledgeable server, Brianna. It was our first time at any Postino so naturally we were clueless. Our server was very patient and super nice to recommend the Monastrell, a delicious robust organic red wine that was light enough for everyone's taste. Definitely coming back for the amazing service from Brianna and the rest of the team at this location."}
{"text":"We visited this location this past weekend. Ordered drinks and an app and it came in a timely manner. We then waited SO long for our entrees. Once they arrived the food was great! I'm giving 5 stars despite the wait time because the manager did what (in my opinion) any good manager should do (in fact, i think they went beyond) when guests have to wait so long for their food. Our waitress apologized several times and they comped our whole bill! Free drinks or dessert would have been fine but I think this shows they care a lot about their customers!"}
{"text":"Had 23 ladies for girls night out to celebrate a birthday. Made a reservation for the outdoor patio. We ran a little late getting there and received a text that our table would be waiting. The table had candles burning and looked absolutely beautiful. Wonderful set up, all the managers and staff were so pleasant to work with. We had Marissa and Juan for our servers. They were wonderful!!! They did a great job with all the orders and food was great. Also very reasonable. I would definitely return rather it be a night out for two or a party of 23."}
{"text":"Never go to this location. We ordered to go bruschetta 2.5 hrs in advance and the manager was extremely rude and denied our request for gluten free bread said they didn't have enough. And complained that we didn't give enough notice. Unacceptable customer service."}
{"text":"WOW!....If I lived in Scottsdale. . This would my hang..!!  I was truly impressed!  I was impressed the moment I drove into the parking lot, this place has style! It's got a great vibe to it! I am in town in business....so I often eat alone... the hostess welcomed  me... I told her I was here for the experience and to sit me in the best  possible spot...or a table that had atmosphere so she sat me outside by the fire which was beautiful! My server's name was Mark and he was exceptional! He welcomed me immediately and asked me all the right questions in order to make the best suggestions for food choices. He was so informative, and probably one of the best servers I've ever had! If you are a wine lover, please sit in his section because he is studying to be a sommelier....and he is so interesting and informative...I learned a lot from him...and he makes the best suggestions....because I loved everything I ordered! The bruschetta was amazing!..  bruschetta is a big deal here Scottsdale apparently... I only ate a few restaurants so far and they all featured bruschetta!  The salad with a brussel sprouts was so incredible! Tori, the manager delivered my food and she made me feel so welcome! I  What can I say except that you have to eat at this restaurant because it's worth the experience, and the food is amazing! I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"While in town for a business meeting this past Tuesday I decided to review some restaurants and this one was the one that caught my attention the most. I went in for a board and bottle. First thoughts the restaurant is very nice and presentable. Hostess are very nice and really do pay attention to when a customer is walking in. Upon being seated the young waiter by the name of Jasmine came to my table and was very nice, presentable, and just absolutely the best. She took my order and in a short period of time I was being served. Jasmine came to ask me not twice but plenty of times to see how well I was doing. She's awesome! I do recommend this place the service is great."}
{"text":"Incredible date night spot. We ordered a bottle of wine, which was excellent.  Paired a nice bottle of white Sauvignon Blanc with the Butcher's Board and 4 different kinds of bruschetta, which was all delicious. We ended the meal with two of the dessert collections, because they looked too good to only have one. There is a great ambience in this rustic restored building. I love good wine and a great tasting menu and Postino's provided just that!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday evening and it wasn't all that busy or else we had just missed the evening rush.  Either way, the staff seemed absent minded and a little off. Maybe they had a very busy day, maybe the heat of the day affected their attitude.  I will say the Butcher Block board was a fine assortment of cheeses, meats and olives. Even though this is listed as an appetizer, you could definitely share as a meal.  There was 3 in our party and we decided to share a selection of four bruschetta's of which the smoked salmon and pesto was my favorite."}
{"text":"Perfect easy date night. The wine and bruschetta are amazing!  They also have some pretty good desserts if you can handle it after all that bread!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Any wine $5 before 5! I got  rosé bubbles that was priced at $11 on the menu and would easily cost $15 at some places. The board had a variety of meats, cheeses, hummus, fruits, and nuts. The cheeses were good, but nothing I'm dreaming about. My only complaint is that the board isn't big enough for everything. All the cheeses, olives, fruit, and nuts were smeared in hummus. They have a nice assortment of bruschetta, and the portions are quite large. Definitely a place to come and share delicious snacks that fill up like a meal. I will definitely recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. Their food is delicious and their wine selection is amazing - Raul was so kind to help me find a wine I would enjoy. I know they also do excellent work within the community. I love this place and would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Just spent another great Sunday funday at Postino. McKenna, our server, knows her stuff and provides great service by pairing the best wines that fit your taste with great food. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Postino. As far as locations go, I think this might be my favorite!!  This location is special because it has an awesome indoor/outdoor area and is larger than some of the others, which I love.   If this is your first time trying Postino, you MUST try the bruschetta. It is out of this world. I've been to a couple of different other places that seem as if they are trying to copy Postino's bruschetta, but it is never as good.   Aside from the bruschetta, the salads are wonderful, all of them, my favorite being the italian picnic. The cheese board is also amazing.   Most importantly, the wine is amazing at Postino. If you are not sure which to try, ALWAYS try the Postino exclusive. It will never let you down. All the locations except for Gilbert will let you take home an unfinished bottle which is really nice also. Even better, on Mondays and Tuesdays if you come at 8pm they have their special - any bottle of wine AND a tray of bruschetta for $20! It cannot be beat!!"}
{"text":"Clown operation run by kids. Waited 20 min to be seated. Watched as the hostess sat her friends who had come in after us. Sat at a dirty table with food all over the floor. Waited for 15 min without anyone helping us. Left without eating. Will never waste our time again!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location and I will certainly be returning. My friends and I went to get dinner before heading to a show. The staff, food, drinks were incredible. Highly recommend the Brie and apple with fig spread bruschetta."}
{"text":"Mark was our server for our Sunday brunch today. He was the most knowledgeable srrver I've ever had dining out. He made great recommendations and provided exceptional service for me, my girlfriend and her brother. We've been waiting to visit this location and it lived up to all of our expectations. Mark was very attentive and really made the experience worthwhile, we even stayed for an additional 2 rounds of drinks after eating our food because of how well he treated us. We can't wait to come back to this Postino!"}
{"text":"this is our go to place! cant beat the $5 glass of wine & $20 bottles until 5pm, everyday!! service has always been impeccable & the gluten free bruschetta is what dreams are made of! favorites include the spicy pepper jam with goat cheese, & smoked salmon. its always a nice surprise when they email a coupon too.. makes going there even more affordable & enjoyable! the atmosphere is wonderful here, young & fun! keep being you postino - you're amazing!"}
{"text":"I came into postinos on Tuesday , it was pretty busy so I sat at the bar while I waited for a table . The bartender Bobby was so friendly and sold me on the upstate chardonnay bottle . So delicious! Once I got my table my server Ameya was just the best! Very friendly , attentive and answered all the million questions I had. I then ordered a bruschetta board , I love the variety of flavors !! The food was so good here I can't wait to bring some friends back! Also siting on the patio while it's so nice out is a must!  $20 for wine and a bruschetta board is unheard of! Everyone must come and try it!!"}
{"text":"Had s great time and food hit the spot.  Sat outside on the patio.  On a chilly night, the fireplace and heat lamps did their job.  Drinks at the bar before. Was pretty loud as it was busy."}
{"text":"It's just like other Postino locations...except this place is even darker (didn't think that was possible) so it's really tough/impossible to read a menu without using your phone's flashlight feature.  This location also has MAJOR leak problems, as we experienced on our second visit last weekend during a monsoon rainstorm.  We told multiple bartenders who clearly did not care, as when we were leaving there was a HUGE puddle inside, which was a hazard for guests who were unaware.  Unfortunately, we were all TOO aware as my date and I were sporadically rained on the entire time we were there.  We actually considered popping open our umbrella, but didn't want to cause (too much of) a scene.  So, we left.  At least when I told a hostess that people will probably fall, she appeared concerned."}
{"text":"Brussels Sprout salad was delicious, the rest of our group had a variety of sandwiches, fresh breads and great blend of flavors. Not a wine drinker, but lots of choices for those that are. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Met a friend who works at the adjacent hair salon  and ordered four selections from the bruschetta menu. Probably in terms of food the standout on the menu. Service started out pretty good and then wandered into the void as the evening progressed  and the place got busier.  They did allow Morris on the patio although there did seem to be some confusion as to whether this was normal policy. If you are going out and your  main interest is socializing than this is a good place. Food is nothing special for the price but decent."}
{"text":"A great little spot! This would be the perfect place to meet up with your girlfriends and have a tasty but not too expensive glass of wine and some delicious tapas. My husband and I got the bruschetta (highly recommend!) and a meat and cheese plate. He was very impressed with his five dollar picture of beer as it was a great deal! The pricing is well worth the food that you receive and when ordering the bruschetta you will be excited and overwhelmed with all the amazing combinations you get to choose from. The atmosphere is also a fun bonus with its industrial mid century modern look."}
{"text":"Awesome cozy secluded patio, yummy fresh food that satisfies the appetite, but won't put you in a mini food coma....music is smooth & jazzy(Erykah Badu) patio is dog friendly(for service dogs anyway)   Staff is attentive, prompt, and friendly(also cute;) Basically...We LOVED IT & will defiantly be back!!! Only thing I would change, is bigger glasses for the $5 mimosas...because, well duh, who doesn't want a bigger mimosa"}
{"text":"This place is without a doubt my favorite place to go! The atmosphere is warm and welcoming, the food is delicious and perfectly portioned, and the service is next level!"}
{"text":"I needed to edit my review because my experience started out fairly poor. The managers, Raul and Laurie, quickly realized I was not having a good time here and fixed it immediately. She came and greeted us, apologized for what happened and made me feel actually welcome. Every time I come here I get stellar service, today started as the exception to that, but was SO quickly revised. That is how a business should be run and I condone their team for that."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Postino and live in Old Town Scottsdale. We were really excited to visit this location and invited friends to join us last night for wine and bruschetta. I read the reviews and thought people were being picky about the music. NOT SO! The music is painfully loud and I was uncomfortable the second I walked in. We arrived at 7pm and there was plenty of parking and only 1 couple near the hostess stand milling about so I thought JACKPOT! We'll get a table quick. There were literally 3 empty booths right by the door and a few tables with hand written Reserved signs on them. Imagine my shock when the hostess said 35-40 minute wait! Probably a godsend because I was already sick of the music, but shouldn't there be a ton of people around if it takes 40 minutes to get a table on Saturday night? I'm still trying to connect the dots? Anyhoo. We left. Not going back until future reviewers say the volume control on the radio is working again and wait times match the number of people waiting on a table."}
{"text":"Brunch at at Postino is always a good idea!  Bruschetta board: prosciutto with mascarpone and figs, smoked salmon with pesto, burrata with bacon & arugula, and roasted peppers with goat cheese. The farmhouse scramble rounded out the meal nicely along with their really good coffee."}
{"text":"This is my favorite of all the Postino locations. It is open and airy, especially during the cooler months. The roast beef sandwich is my top choice for lunch, the port salut cheese is so good! Here's a tip: you can order 1, 2 or 3 pieces of bruschetta. You don't have to be stuck with 4 if you are dining alone. Cheers to $5 wine until 5pm everyday!"}
{"text":"I've made visits to several of the Postino locations around the valley and can honestly say each one has been very nice, each in it's own way. This was my first visit to Postino Highland and it's no exception. I typically post up at the bar or at a nearby patio. The restaurant sits a bit up above the sidewalk along Scottsdale Rd. The bar is located on the outer corner of the space and gives a nice, open feel that is just right this time of year with the nice fall temperatures.   While we didn't sample any of the menu items other than a nice crisp Sauvignon Blanc, the offerings are generally quite good ( based on my experiences at other locations ); I was tempted by the Bruschetta selections ordered by the young ladies seated next to us. Next time! And the NYC Grilled Cheese is always a good choice.   The bar seating is really comfortable, the stools / chairs a notch above your typical narrow, ungainly furnishing so: Points there. Staff was great, pretty busy on a Sunday afternoon but always friendly and really helpful and engaging. The vibe is fun, an ideal spot to hang out with friends or even solo. I'll definitely be returning, likely updating this review once I gain a more fleshed out insight to one of my favorite destinations."}
{"text":"We had expected the same great service as we had at the Scottsdale Quarter location but were sadly disappointed. My three girlfriends and I went there for happy hour recently. We sat down and noticed it ends at 5:00 pm which is very odd for happy hour and which we did not know before selecting Postino. Most places are 6 pm or even 7 pm like Stone and Vine. Anyway, it was 5:04 pm so we nicely asked our server if she could give us our first glass of wine for the happy hour price ($5). She said, \"no, it's 5:04.\"  We should have left then. We proceeded to have wine (at $10 and $12 a glass) and a light dinner. Service was rude. The door to the patio near us was constantly left open and the 107 degree heat was not enjoyable at all! Not sure ANY of us will visit this location again!"}
{"text":"The best board and bottle happy hour! Make sure someone in your party arrives 20-30 min before 8 pm happy hour (mon/tues) because it gets packed!   Once you put your name in you can get a drink at the bar and download the Nowait app to monitor your place in line.   Perfekt Reisling and Bodini Malbec are versatile wines for sharing. The warm artichoke and salami with pesto are the best bruschetta. Boards can be made with gluten free or regular bread!"}
{"text":"Always a delicious experience! Bruschetta is to die for (salmon pesto is my favorite!). $5 wine before 5 everyday? I'm in."}
{"text":"Mairi is incredible; efficient, helpful and friendly.  Food and wine were great as always... but Mairi made the visit special!! We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwich! I had the prosciutto with brie and a glass of Cabernet. It was a perfect combination. A friend had a bruschetta board that looked amazing. It was very crowded on a Saturday evening, but if you have the time to wait for a table, it is worth it."}
{"text":"Marisa Cluff killed it again with the serving! We love coming to Postino! Everyone is so friendly and the wine and bruschetta are amazing"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I came in for brunch yesterday and it was delicious. We sat at the bar which was very busy but everyone was very attentive and great! My fiancé isn't much of a wine drinker but liked the beer selection and we were impressed with the happy hour pricing. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place soooo much!! The \"Board & Bottle\" (Monday & Tuesday nights) is a great reason to pop out early in the week, and a very nice deal!! A board of bruschetta and bottle of wine for $20!!! The staff is always super friendly and go up and beyond to give great service in all areas. Love the bruschetta, love the salads, cheese board, love the soups (only wish the had their Red pepper Gouda soup available every single day!! Heaven!!)  The location is excellent, the service is always exceptional, and add consistently great food to the list, and this place is simply a WIN!! Yayyyyy!!  (They even have great parking with is rare in Scottsdale)"}
{"text":"My wife and I eagerly chose to dine at Postino Highland last night (Father's Day), being fans of Postino in Gilbert and Phoenix-Arcadia. The Postino Highland did not seem like either of the other Postinos we have enjoyed.   First of all, the god-awful music was poorly chosen and way over-amplified. It seemed at times like ultra-hip urban jazz, at times like a mad high school garage band, and at other times like music to go crazy by.   Second, the service was poor. We were left for seemingly long periods during the meal. Our wait person was pleasant enough, she just wasn't attentive.   Third, the food disappointed for the first time at a Postino. We started the meal with their very good bella postino consisting of artichoke and white bean hummus dips. We ran out of bread before we finished, and our wait person was nowhere to be found.   My wife ordered their \"soup of the moment,\" which was so spicy she couldn't eat it. Our wait person never came by after serving our food to see if it was okay.   I ordered their Hannah's field salad. The greens were tough and overpowered the other ingredients. But I did develop stronger jaw muscles while eating part of it.   Their wines by the glass are over-priced compared to many other quite decent restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale.   We do not plan to return to Postino Highland unless they make a big turnaround. A very small number of diners were there when we arrived, and when we left there were no other customers remaining, before the sun went down! If the music had been pleasant and in the background, they may have lingered longer.   So, two thumbs down on that visit!"}
{"text":"I'd suggest sitting by the bar area near SCOTTSDAL Scottsdale Rd.  Great ambience and view.  I like to do the half and half with the Nine Iron sandwich and Raspberry Fields salad."}
{"text":"If we could give zero stars we would.  What a disappointment! Our waitress greeted us took our order and we never saw her again. 4 out of the 5 of us received  our food. Eggs were freezing cold, potatoes not crispy like we ordered instead soft and cold. Oh the bacon, the bacon just came off the pig way undercooked!! We got management because like we said waitress never came back told them food cold etc. but more importantly one did not get meal. Got new meals again .  Hoping for better NOPE the same and the Walnut bread with preservers dry cold and bland even the preserves no flavor. The finale no comp on drinks or any meal even the one that we didn't get!  Waste of money waste of precious time.  Go to the Breakfast Club you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly staff and awesome food and drink selection! Also loved the $5 drinks before 5 pm!"}
{"text":"I love this Postino's location! It is right around the corner from Fashion Square Mall.   The food is delicious, I have gotten the Chicken & Mozzarella panini here. I would definitely would be getting this again. On the other hand, they do have a wonderful selection of wine.  The environment is clean and open. I love sitting on the patio even though it is facing the parking lot. But hey, who cares!"}
{"text":"What's not to love? They certainly have a recipe for success - same delicious food, same great service, same awesome beer and wine options, great new location.  We came for their soft opening, and it was a wonderful evening. The cheese board and bruschetta boards were on point. Naturally, I had myself some lovely bellinis and the main squeeze had some yummy dark beer. The only downside to the evening was that they didn't yet have a couple of the beers on the menu. My fiancé had to order 3 times because every beer he ordered was not in stock yet. However, you can't really find fault with that since literally 3 days ago this place still had no windows and no interior. They got everything up and running overnight!  New favorite spot for an easy date night. Plus, it's right next to my salon so I'm probably going to have some bubbly here before I get my hair cut next :)"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, fantastic service. Only thing that prevented me from saying it was perfect? Need more Rose's on the wine menu. Ours was great BUT I wish I had another two or three to choose from.   Bruschetta? You want it? They have it. Four people in your group? Get a Butcher's Block and one Bruschetta. A bottle (or two) of wine? Perfect night. Park around back for easier parking spots. The walk will give you time to realize on the way out you should probably Uber home"}
{"text":"Bruschetta was delicious! Paninis and salad were good! Next time I'll try the soup as well. Very nice ambiance and staff were pleasant and worked efficiently.   No complaints.. I'm going to try the other locations as well :)"}
{"text":"I'm not really a wine drinker, so beyond going to the original Postino's in Phoenix to check it out a few times back when it first opened in the early 2000's, I hadn't bothered to visit any of the other locations.  However, a couple of my coworkers selected the Scottsdale location as their choice for lunch when we went to celebrate their birthdays recently and I was very impressed. The food is excellent. Postino's has a great selection of sandwiches, salads, soups and flatbreads to choose from and everything is excellent. I tried the roast beef sandwich on one occasion and the nine-iron, with bacon and chicken on another. My coworkers had everything from the soup of the day to the flatbreads and everyone was very happy.  The atmosphere was very welcoming, with large open tables and plenty of room. Also, unlike some places the acoustics and background noise were good so that you could actually the people across the table from you. Service was fast and friendly as well.  I was glad to find that Postino's is more than just a wine bar and would definitely recommend it as a place to visit!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy Postino. $5 glasses of wine till 5pm. The bruchetta board is delicious and one of my favorite menu items. The brunch here is also pretty tasty. Good ambiance. It's a nice place to have a date."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh this place was sooooo good. We loved the atmosphere, the service and all the suggestions they gave! The apps we got and the panini we split was sooooo very good. Our waiter was very friendly, extremely kind with our daughter and good with suggesting items we would like!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Gilbert Location and the Camelback location as well. This location was very disappointing. I'm soooo glad that I didn't take a customer there or book this for our executives. There was bird feces everywhere out back. We sat out back and I felt like I was sitting in bird droppings all around me. I was disgusted. We moved inside because the sun was blinding us and it was so dirty. It was much cleaner inside; however, the service was not good (a young gal with long dark hair). We received our food and our waitress never came to ask us if we needed anything or how everything was. Another gal, with long dark hair, did give us a refill..... which when she filled a glass of iced tea, it ran onto the floor and she never came back to wipe it up.  We finally had to ask someone to get our check. On a good note, the food was really great, just very disappointed in the cleanliness and service. Hope this helps."}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to swing by this new location twice now. On a Sunday and Thursday.    Great early happy hour specials with $5 for wine!  But it ends at 5! So you'll need to get yer drink on early.    The bruschetta is phenomenal and really filling!  I liked the one with dates in it the best...but all are great in my opinion.   The wine selection is robust and their Italian negroamaro red pairs nicely with their Italian themed dishes. When in Rome...or Scottsdale...  Great setup with bar area with misters and decent patio.  A lot of open air and natural lighting.    Only knock is no Mexican beer options and bartenders need to look up more and be attentive. Once you have their attention all is great."}
{"text":"Great service. The atmosphere and attitude in this place is always great. They always have the best wines and bruschetta is great. A+"}
{"text":"Say what?! I haven't review this Postino yet?  As veteran of all things Postino, I can confidently say that this location is my favorite. I love the indoor and outdoor spaces, and the parking is easy and plentiful. There's tons of seating available plus the bar is huge so I've never had to wait for a table. Now that's something!  Of course, all the food and beverage offerings are the same across all the Postino locations. If you're a newbie, get the bruschetta and enjoy an affordable bottle of wine."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and plenty of food options. I actually found my favorite wine here too!"}
{"text":"We had a Bridal Shower there Saturday Feb 10th.  It could not have been more perfect.  The staff was so outstanding, the food was wonderful and a good time was had by all.  The Postino staff was on target from the beginning to the end, they made it easy.  Thank you so much!!!"}
{"text":"Jazmin was the best. She recommended a cab/malbec called Disruption that was tasty af. You should only hope you get her to serve your party next time you stop in. Go here!"}
{"text":"Postinos is simply the best!  I could eat here every day!  $5 wine by the glass until 5pm daily, excellent bruschetta, great patio!  What more could one want!"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of Postinos. This one is no exception. I like how open this location is and each one has it's own charm. The bruschetta and wine was good like always. I would come to this location while around the Scottsdale Fashion Square area. Service was good and its a great place to go with friends."}
{"text":"We came in for lunch and enjoyed our meal outside. The food was good! I'd recommend the grilled cheese for appetizer. Not sure you can go wrong with any of their paninis too. They are also vegetarian and vegan friendly."}
{"text":"Very nice place for Sunday brunch.  Enjoyed food and coffee. Not busy for brunch.  Definitely we will try other food again."}
{"text":"Ended up here on Sunday for a pretty decent lunch. We both ordered the Turkey Pannini on Ciabatta bread. It was a good tasting sandwich, but it contained two slices of turkey and that turkey was not the best quality. It also could have been pressed more on the machine. The side of chips were out of the bag, but the side salad which contained raspberry and some cheese and leafy greens and walnuts was pretty good. The Bellini was only $5 and that had a nice refreshing taste, while all glasses of wine are also only $5 until 5pm. Very young crowd now that school is back in session. Probably will stick to the Brushetta if we return."}
{"text":"I loved all of the assortments of Bruschetta! Anything with goat cheese is okay with me. Plus, you can't beat $5 glasses of wine for Happy Hour before 5:00. Our server was great.  Very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Beautiful and delicious. Hubby and I went out for a date. We were looking for tapas and wandered to Scottsdale. Impressed by the Bruchetta Board my children and I enjoyed at the Tempe location, I was eager for my husband to enjoy the experience as well.   Postino is a semi-outdoor, open concept. Even though it was hot on the outside, with the misters, it felt surprisingly cool.  We were ushered to a table immediately by our lovely hostess. Our attentive server took care of us, providing careful service that was not overbearing.   I enjoyed my refreshing Bellini ($5 everyday/all the time). Hubby ordered a Pilsner on tap that stayed cold through the evening.   We ordered 2 Bruschetta Boards ($15 each). You select from a list of toppings. They organized the Bruchetta from mildest flavors to most robust. Board 1: Brie and Green Apple with preserves, Prosciutto with figs, Smoked Salmon with Pesto, Burrata and Bacon. Board 2: Warm artichoke, Pistachio and date, Pesto Salami and Seasonal: Romanesco and cauliflower. This was a feast for the senses. The boards are colorful, packed with flavor and textures. Our favorites were the well balanced Brie, green apple and preserves combination that balanced sweet, savory and tart. The smoked salmon was delicate, accented by the pesto and capers. We were surprised by the Romanesco cauliflower combination. We liked the textures of the roasted corn and cauliflower on the Romanesco backdrop. We thought the weakest combinations were the Warm artichoke and the Pistachio Date pairings. They were not bad, just not outstanding.  Thank you, Postino, for a lovely dining experience. I did not disappoint my Honey with this recommendation."}
{"text":"We had such a wonderful time here! Happy hour was wonderful and good was delish! The prosecco wasn't the best but the rose we had was very good! We especially loved the cheese board! We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Food good, service very good, pricing so-so, but it's so loud inside you can't talk. Get an outside table if you don't want a headache."}
{"text":"Love the old town location great food, amazing wine selection. But the highlight for my wife and I is great old school genuine service. We're not rushed, staff wil explain the menu and food items. Every time we go the manager (Raul? I think) stops by to chat, and check on us. Best of the valley"}
{"text":"Postino contacted me after I wrote this review and asked that I give them a second chance.  We love the food at Postino and appreciated them reaching out to us so we went back.  It was absolutely perfect- great service, great food, great atmosphere.  Everyone treated us great and took such good care of us.  That is how service should be!  Looking forward to going back again as soon as we can.  Thank you, Raul, and the staff at Postino Highland for being so awesome."}
{"text":"Came here for the $20 bruschetta and bottle of wine night. There's so many options of bruschetta that you can chose from/mix and match which is nice. I've seen a few reviews complain about music being too loud but I didn't agree. I loved the old school R&B. The restaurant has a nice atmosphere; dark and candle lit. It was very romantic. I would recommend it for a date night. The service was good. But keep in mind, this is not a place where you can expect to get your food right away. Expect at least 25 minutes after ordering. This was completely fine for my boyfriend and I. It gave us time to enjoy our wine and talk. We may make this Monday and Tuesday deal a weekly ritual because we loved it so much."}
{"text":"Pretty good establishment the food was great but not the best and the music was too loud. Really, the music is just too loud for casual conversation. I thought the choices for bruschetta was great lots of options had great choices of many different flavors, but the bruschetta I had at a local competitor it was better.   Had I not been to that other restaurant I probably would have like this one a lot better. Out of respect for Postino I will not mention who that competitor was. Overall we had a great experience the food is not overpriced as on the menu were sandwiches soups and appetizers but all in all had a great time. I would come back."}
{"text":"Great service, great atmosphere and great food!  I absolutely love their bruschetta. Very good assortment of bruschetta choices and fresh ingredients. Today I indulged in dessert and ordered their chocolate lava cake (it was called boushon or something like that). That was pretty awesome. It was very good and light. They don't overdo it in the portion size of dessert. Just enough. The music isn't loud but I find myself m singing to many great songs."}
{"text":"The staff has actually never been nice at this location. Monday special is fun because you get a $20 bottle of wine. This is a chill place but not to go to if you're hungry."}
{"text":"It was fine. Wait was WAYYYYY long. I wouldn't say it was worth the wait, brunch was average. Not bad, not great. Eggs were lukewarm and walnut toast was slightly burnt. It was a central location for four of us to meet though and once we were seated we had a great visit.  A little customer service training (smile and greet people, check back on the table once in awhile!) would go a long way, but that's true of most places these days."}
{"text":"Having a wonderful time at postino tonight. Great service and food! As a former restaurant general manager was very impressed with the staff. Ameya our server was amazing! Recommeded and explained the rose' and explained the tasting for us. One gentleman (I think his name was Raul. I hope I'm right on that) was exceptional. I'm thinking he was the manager. Helping out anywhere needed. Definitely recommending this location!"}
{"text":"I joined some friends for the infamous board and bottle! What a wonderful time. I tried the French rose wine for the first time and was pleasantly pleased. I also tried their seasonal bruschetta, which featured corn and it was amazing. Marc was a fabulous server and had some great recommendations. This was my first time visiting the highland location and I was not disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great service, bartenders and waitstaff are always friendly and attentive. As well as super patient while I decide, with each glass, more painfully, what to have next. Great selection of wines, although I do wish the wines by the glass changed more often."}
{"text":"I've never experienced a salad tasting as good as their Waldorf Chicken Salad ! Never remove this from the menu."}
{"text":"Love the vibe at Postino Highland. Ordered the Brie and prosciutto panini. It was a little on the salty side and very bready, but it was bomb. The wine menu is extensive. It's easy to find a wine that hits the right spot. Happy hour ends at 5. Y tho?"}
{"text":"Friday night we hosted my son and daughter-in-law's rehearsals dinner on the patio and it was fabulous!! The event coordinator Natalie was amazing, so knowledgeable and helpful, guiding us with types and quantity of food and beverage for 40+ guests.  She really is experienced. The food was fabulous, the ambiance was magical - string lights overhead, fireplace,  candles and we brought in flowers for the tables and rented white linen table cloths.  The weather was perfect for it and the guests were wowed!  We got compliments all night long and throughout the weekend.  My son and his bride said it couldn't have possibly been any better!  It had a sophisticated but relaxed vibe,  a perfect ice breaker to kick off the wedding weekend . The bartender and wait staff were amazing. And it was a LOT more affordable than the other places we checked into."}
{"text":"I recently celebrated my birthday here and overall had a great experience. I like that you are able sit indoors or outdoors (though all of the outdoor tables were reserved for happy hour so make sure you make a reservation!) our server misunderstood my order but was very quick to correct it. He was extremely nice as was the hostess. This is one of my favorite restaurants because of the food and wine selection as well as the prices. I highly recommend visiting!"}
{"text":"Thought we'd try the postinos in Scottsdale. First off, it's Scottsdale so you know you're going to deal with people who feel they are better than you. That being said, ordered a pitcher (their pitchers are the American style only 2 beers)  of beer which was the worst pour I've seen with 30% head and i never complain about too much head unless it's my beer. When i mentioned this to the staff, they informed us, the customer that we're wrong, and that it was mandated to pour with a lot of head..... thanks for telling me how to \"pour\" a beer. This is the last time I'll let Postinos pour my beer."}
{"text":"This location is a true gem on its own. While the other locations are wonderful, this restaurant stands out above the rest. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted by the most amazing and attentive staff. From the host to our server, Mairi, to the manager, Raul, my party was treated with so much hospitality. Everyone was genuinely friendly and very accommodating. That alone is enough to make me want to return.    The interior of the restaurant affects an intimate ambiance of romance the likes of which I've never felt at any other location. From the table candles to the dimmed lighting, the staff has spared no inattention to detail. My mood was instantly elevated and I could not stop smiling.  Now on to the food. Everything, and I do mean everything, tasted so fresh and amazing. I was impressed with the flavors and the wine selection was respectable. Although, I do feel unworthy of commenting on the wine list since I'm not much of a connoisseur. In fact, I ordered a glass of moscato and while I was met with expressions of disdain and shame from my own party, our server continued to treat me with a dignity I clearly did not deserve.   Great food coupled with atmosphere and impeccable service (truly, second to none) makes this my new go-to for date nights or just a casual dinner with close friends. Because of Raul and Mairi, I will definitely return more often. Thank you so much for providing such a beautiful experience."}
{"text":"Love Postinos! This location is great. Food and service were wonderful. 4 stars instead of 5 because of the bad acoustics- not a good place to go if you're looking to have a detailed conversation. Also, we had 6 people- and the curved booths were too small; would have fit 5 comfortably. We will remember to request a larger area for next time. Love the Monday/Tuesday bruschetta & wine $20 specials! Will definitely return here again."}
{"text":"I live nearby and go to Sachi for my hair so I find myself at Postinos in Old town often. I will admit when it first opened I found it to be a little bit lack luster.... however, recently I have fallen in love with it. The service has been so impressive that it has become my number one spot to bring clients and friends to! Raul checked in with us and accommodated my client who not only has a nut allergy but a SEED allergy. Customer service is such a lost art in this town but Raul goes above and beyond. I'm so grateful I live close to such a great spot."}
{"text":"I loved it here! Adorable patio, AMAZING food, and very friendly service! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this location! It is conveniently located near Fashion Square Mall in Old Town Scottsdale. Great for an afternoon lunch break from shopping, Happy Hour with the pals, or even a celebration! The open floor plan is welcoming and their patio is pretty fantastic. I LOVE their wall made out of match books! Such a great touch.   As for the food - well everyone knows how amazing Postino is! But, of course, the bruschetta board is a must. My dream board is:  Brie + Green Apples Warm Artichoke Red Peppers + Goat Cheese Salami + Pesto P.S. If you want to add a 5th choice because you just can't decide, you CAN without ordering another entire board.  So my 5th favorite is the bacon + burrata! ;)   Yup, get those and a bottle of wine and you'll be a happy camper, PROMISE! You also can't go wrong with their salads, sandwiches, and soup of the day! See you soon, Postino!"}
{"text":"We were pretty disappointed with the service... we waited way too long for the food.  Yes... the atmosphere was very cool but it's still not worth it for us."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu here is extremely delicious! You can't go wrong with the bruschetta board! (my favorite is the almond hummus and chopped tomatoes) all of the salads and paninis here are yummy too! A really rad thing about this place is they are GF and vegan friendly! The large variety of wine here makes it effortless to pair the perfect glass with my meal. Also the deals here are amazing! $5 glasses of wine and pitchers of beer until 5pm everyday! Not to mention the $20 board of bruschetta and bottle of wine nights on Monday and Tuesday! Postino is easily one of my favorite places to dine"}
{"text":"Favorite place to go! Awesome deals on wine and beer before 5pm and great service. Food is consistently amazing! Never a miss coming here!"}
{"text":"Classic Postino restaurant very clever and clean design and furnishings. Friendly helpful staff. Great brunch menu. The Country Eggs are recommended as is their version of French Toast. Ya'll come over"}
{"text":"Last Friday I got off of work (as another member of the industry) and met some friends at the new Postinos on Scottsdale rd. First of all I LOVE Postinos- I have frequented the Arcadia location and recently went into the Kierland location where I received great service. The food never disappoints. Last Friday I received terrible service. I was on the patio and the server was a female with brown hair and I wish I got her name because whoever owns the franchise cannot want someone like that working for them. She was genuinely annoyed at the thought of doing anything for us. I am very forgiving of servers who get busy or have bad nights because I have been there but this was just a miserable experience. I arrived a little after the others and asked for water- the server never brought it so I asked someone else. She actually never came to the table after I arrived for a solid 15 minutes in the first place. Finally when she did come I ordered everything because the other members of my party said she was not reliable. I got an appetizer and an entree - they just came out at the same time. She genuinely looked disgusted by us every time we interacted with her. I still am giving this 3 stars because I love the food and next time I'm in hopefully we get better service."}
{"text":"Select 2 combo $11: I went with the soup of the day which was a roasted red pepper with Gouda soup and prosciutto with Brie panini. The soup was really good! It didn't think I'd like it much because red pepper but it tasted more like tomato soup. I was disappointed with the panini because on paper it combined a bunch of things I like, but I was left thinking it was just OK.   Perfekt Riesling $11: Riesling is always my safe choice when I don't know what wine to pick otherwise.   Salted caramel sundae $8: I really just had a craving for ice cream. It comes with plenty of extra caramel sauce to pour on. I didn't really like the chocolate covered corn nuts so I left those alone."}
{"text":"I absolutely love coming to Postino. What's not to love? The bruschetta is amazing, and so is everything on the menu. I'm happy that they have opened so many locations in the past year. They are really good for groups so if you're having a birthday or some sort of festivity, I'd recommend coming to Postino. My favorite location is the Highland. I love the decor inside and the layout. I must say the prosciutto bruschetta is my favorite. I also love the chicken mozzarella panini with the brussels sprout salad."}
{"text":"Much love! Great friendly service and wonderful compilations of different tasty treats! Even our kids loved it! It has more parking than the other Postino's and a great wine list."}
{"text":"Got half salad and half sandwich just for $11.50 and it was pretty good I love all of their sandwiches and salads!"}
{"text":"The chicken and mozz sandwich is insane. Spicy and amazing. The boards are out of control. The service was great. Perfect amount of attention to our order and our drinks. The staff is knowledgeable, friendly and seem happy to be working."}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoy going to this location because it is close to home and have found the quality similar to other Postino's in the area.  We often go for happy hour and order the Butcher Block (an appetizer consisting of various meats, cheeses, olives, nuts and hummus) to enjoy with our wine.  In the past we have always found the food fresh with a wonderful presentation.  The last couple of times it seemed kind of slapped together and did not seem as fresh. We are wondering if the chain is growing too fast, or they are taking on a more corporate culture since they are now have so many locations.  We still enjoy going but are concerned that one of our favorite places is losing some of its charm."}
{"text":"I usually never have anything bad to say about the service when going out to eat but this was the absolute worst service i've ever had from our server Randi...I waited 20 minutes before we got our order in until a different server had to come take our order, our server did not seem very friendly when we would ask to order something else, we had to wait 15 minutes to order drinks and then an additional 20 min once our joiners came and sat down."}
{"text":"Still love this place and they were so accommodating today. I was able to make a last min reservation and they honored that. We let them know we had an infant and toddler with us, they gave my little one some cool pliable sticks that she played with the whole time And they gave us enough room for my friend to be able to park her stroller close enough to her so that she could watch her baby. My friends ordered a sandwich to share and they split it for them, this was a nice added touch- they are also vegetarian and the server was great about going over options with them. Since my last review they have added a veggie board called The Bounty....this is my new fave option here. While it's technically an appetizer, I order it often as my main dish. It includes lots of fresh veggies, grilled cauliflower and flash fried brussel sprouts, plus a delish almond hummus and plenty of treats. We also tried the butcher's block and were impressed with the variety of cured meats, olives, nuts, dried cherries, cheese and on and on and on.... Def give this place a try, the food is excellent and the service has always been top notch."}
{"text":"The food was five stars for sure!  Always is!  The service was great too,  but we went in for brunch hoping for an amazing mimosa and were a bit disappointed.  It was basically half a glass of orange juice.  I get it, only $5!  But I didn't make up the pricing, lol.  I would definitely go back, just with a lower expectation of my mimosa."}
{"text":"Mondays & Tuesdays $20 bottle & board deal? Need I say more? Absolutely love the chill vibe on the outside patio. My favorite way to beat the Monday blues with my girlfriends. Our server was so prompt and friendly, with a continuous smile on her face. I noticed the table next to us brought their adorable dogs so I'm assuming it's pet-friendly, in the outside seating. Love this new location, I would definitely be returning very soon."}
{"text":"This is absolutely my favorite spot in Scottsdale. The food is great. The wine is tasty and the restaurant itself is beautiful. Definitely a must go."}
{"text":"Another great postino's location. The $5 pitchers of beer and glasses of wine are a great deal. The menu and ambiance is similar to all other locations. I think this business will be successful with its good food and proximity to old town and the mall. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Normally a huge fan of this place but the service really left a lot to be desired. The food (bruschetta board) and wine were superb, and we were ready to order more, but we sat here with empty plates and empty wine glasses for over 10 minutes without being so much as acknowledged. As much as I enjoy this place, that was REALLY disappointing."}
{"text":"My husband and I shared the vegetarian panini and I can tell you that I haven't had this quality, delicious, and hearty of a vegetarian sandwich in a VERY long time! They split the panini and side salad for us before it reached the table. I am from out of town otherwise I would be a frequent visitor of this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Very casual, atmosphere- great happy hour pricing. The wine list is awesome. The food is okay, nothing special but I still really enjoy the vibe here. I would recommend sitting on the back patio, it's perfect in the spring !!"}
{"text":"We were staying in Old Town Scottsdale, so we decided to check out the latest outpost of Postino.  It definitely didn't disappoint and we enjoyed a $5 glass of wine before 5pm - such an amazing deal!  We sat at the bar and were served by some amazing bartenders.  Nice atmosphere, great menu and consistent service."}
{"text":"Hands down, Postino (and this location in particular) is my favorite restaurant in the Scottsdale and greater Phoenix area! The open-air location is GORGEOUS, the service is impeccable, and the happy hour is amazing ($5 pitchers of craft beer and glasses of wine until 5PM)!!  And I haven't even gotten to the bruschetta yet!! Before Postino, I used to think that bruschetta had to be watery tomato spread on uninspiring pieces of hard toast. I was SO WRONG. The bruschetta board here serves up HUGE, FLUFFY pieces of bread topped with fresh ingredients. My personal favorites are the Brie & Apples with Fig Spread, Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, and the Warm Artichoke Spread.  The craziest thing to me is that every time my good friend Megan T. and I have stopped by on a weekend, there's been NO WAIT. If this place existed in San Francisco, I guarantee you'd need to wait AT LEAST an hour. Arizona, please get your sh*t together and give this place the recognition it deserves!  Now that I'm moved out of Arizona, my heart breaks knowing that I won't know the next time I'll be able to come back. Postino, you have a guaranteed customer in me if you ever make a move to California :)"}
{"text":"I love Postinos. I have been to everyone in the Valley. The consistency of food, service, people, atmosphere, and overall branding is awesome.   The $5 wines are obviously a hit. The food is on point and everyone is enjoying themselves.   Recently I have sat at the bar to get food and drinks. Derek is one of the bar tenders and he remembered me from the last time I was here. This is so paramount in my opinion because it's about service. They see hundreds of people a day and for someone to remember you only after seeing you one time is pretty impressive. As a patron it makes me feel like I'm included and part of the game.   I usually get the bruschetta variations and again, consistent and never disappointed in the taste and quality. The staff is super nice. I also worked while I was sitting here and to have a wifi connection is big. Thank you for that.   Overall great time and enjoy coming here."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed about my visit tonight. I have been going to the Arcadia location for many years and never had a issue. When I came in tonight with two of my friend the staff seemed to be unorganized. No one even acknowledge us when we came in. A few minutes go by and a female asked if we have been helped and we said no. She was about to sit us outside when she was interrupted by the guy \"who seemed like a manager\" and he said no you cannot put them out there we have a lot of people in front of them, which there was just one couple outside by the entrance waiting. The \"manager\" said we can wait 30 minutes or go to the bar. When walking around the bar and there were no seats. And no one around to help....... Disappointing night and I'll never go back to that location again. I think it's time for a new manager!!!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour coupled with great food. Only problem was the service. We sat at the bar. Our food came out and we didn't have silverware. It took 10 minutes to finally get the attention of the bartender. Same for the check. 5 people were behind the bar moving glasses around and no one was paying attention to customers. This is not at all what I expected since the other locations are very attentive."}
{"text":"Love the food, but service was lacking.  We felt like we were imposing on the staff.  Not a fun experience when we invited friends after raving about this place.  Unfortunately, we had not been to this location, but have always enjoyed Postino Annex (near the University) and would rate that location 5 stars."}
{"text":"Fantastic service and excellent food. We had brunch there and also dinner at another visit. The Bruschetta is over the top delicious."}
{"text":"Very bustling yet cozy Postino's location near Fashion Square mall in Scottsdale. Service and food are reliably on point. You can never go wrong with any of the bruschetta offerings or the cheese/charcuterie boards. Parking can be a bit of a challenge depending on how busy it is."}
{"text":"Incredible customer service. Our waiter Carlos was amazing! We happened to come at the exact time of two HUGE parties, so our food took a long time to come out. They picked up our tab and made us feel like royalty! Like.... what?!?! The manager, Tori, stopped by our table and apologized for the wait. She was extremely personable and sweet. This is our new spot!!!! Once weekly AT LEAST. Our wine and bruschetta was the best I've ever had. Incredible customer service on top of that?? THAT is what makes an awesome restaurant. This is a must-try place."}
{"text":"A group of us went to Postino's for a light lunch. We told the waiter to choose three Bruschetta boards with a variety of flavors. The boards were perfect. All of the different flavors were perfect matches. I don't remember all of the flavors, but here are some of them. Brie & Apples with Fig Spread, Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, Smoked Salmon with Pesto, Sweet & Spicy Pepper Jam with Goat Cheese (my absolute favorite). Had a great time."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance and the food is good. Huge fan of the board and bottle special, but haven't been at this location yet (just the tempe location). Service is good, but both times I have gone its been pretty empty and service was really slow (waiter even forgot to put in our brunch order once and we finally asked where our food was after 40 minutes). But over all its a great place!"}
{"text":"I'm not so happy with postinos at the moment but it does not regard their food so I will give it 5 stars simply because I love their bruschetta board.  I believe Mon and Tues you get a wine bottle and board for only 20 bucks.  I love mix and matching between sweet and salty choices.  My all time favorite is probably salmon because you can never go wrong with that but there is a fig pistachio one which is also really good.  I like the atmosphere and the servers are usually pretty good and friendly."}
{"text":"I have always loved Postino's great food and atmosphere. However the last few times have been less than desirable. The last time I was in was seated but had to wait to sit for a few minutes so the young man could take the 2 extra plates, why not take them after we have sat instead of us standing awkwardly in the way of others. Service to get our drinks was slow, mind you there were only a few other tables sat as we were there pretty early. The food came wrong requested chips as side was given salad when asked to get chips they came with attitude again 5 minutes later. Asked for a refill on Diet came back 10 minutes later with regular. Had to hunt down the waiter for the check only to have to hunt him back down to get the $3 charge for chips to be taken off. Even after all this I decided to do a to go order today. Was on hold for 10 minutes before hanging up and taking my business elsewhere. Will not be back and this was a place I regularly got lunch from twice a week. Do not know if new management but extremely disappointing."}
{"text":"I had heard good things about Postinos and my daughter and I decided that while having lunch together in Old Town we would try it.  First off, when we entered we were disappointed that we could not get Pasta for lunch.   But we decided on a few items and sat and sat and sat.  The server was quite obviously ignoring us as my daughter was completely turned around in her seat and unable to make eye contact with her. Finally I asked one of the young men walking around if we could order as we were suddenly pressed for time to get my daughter to work.  Mostly because it was seventeen minutes from the time we sat down and ordered drinks until I was able to flag down someone to take our order.   Although the server heard me ask the young man if we could order she looked right through us and asked him \"you got it?\"    When the food finally came it was ok. Nothing exceptional but the server continued to be very apathetic.  It seemed to be directed at me although I have no idea why.   All in all a very disappointing experience.  I am a bartender and server and I would be absolutely embarrassed to treat any of my guests the way we were treated.  I was dressed in jeans and a t shirt as I had been cleaning house prior to picking my daughter up.  But I am always an above average tipper and in spite of the sub par service still left 20 percent with hope that the young man who took our order and followed up on our table several times would get the tip.   There are many restaurants in that area I suggest you go somewhere where your business will be appreciated and you will be treated like a guest not an inconvenience."}
{"text":"I mean I guess with as many reviews as this place has, the secret is out! I absolutely love the concept of Postino and this location was great. A very hip interior and a lovely patio make this place a dream to come to...and that is before we even start talking about the food and drink. If I lived up in this area, I would probably come for their bottle and board special (1 bottle of wine and a board of bruschetta for $20! INSANE) all the time. I of course did try their wine and bruschetta which were very good. They have $5 glasses of wine or $5 pitchers of beer daily from 11am-5pm. Their bruschetta stole the show for me though. A couple of my favorites were the smoked salmon with pesto, warm artichoke spread, and their seasonal (when we went it was a sweet lemon mascarpone that was to die for!) Move a location down to Tucson please!!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a fun lunch spot that was dog friendly to bring my boss for his birthday and after calling to verify that we could bring his dog, we decided to give Postino a try. After being sat and a bowl being brought for the pooch, we began ordering. We began with wine and after the third in our party arrived we began to order our lunch. We started with the bruschetta and that was absolutely amazing. I would very much recommend the smoked salmon with pesto and the goat cheese and roasted red peppers. Those were my personal favorites. For lunch we had the chicken salad, the soup of the moment (italian sausage which was the perfect size and incredibly flavorful) and the vegetarian panini as well as the grilled cheese.  This place seems perfectly laid back for lunch and the food is incredible. For a perfect almost winter day, sitting on the patio just made it that much more relaxed. Plus the pooch enjoyed himself and all of the attention he received. I would definitely recommend as a perfect lunch or dinner spot."}
{"text":"Love love love it... the bruschetta boards are amazing - nice wine list, great date place, ambiance... nice place to relax and talk w/ a friend.  So glad we tried it, we'll be back.  Just wish they could do something about the bird droppings on the patio because the patio is the way to go."}
{"text":"So so amazing! All their food and drinks are great. You can't go wrong. Their boards are a must! I love the beautiful atmosphere and they're open for brunch too!"}
{"text":"Stopped in Sunday about 11am. Nice place just north of camelback that is a wine and beer place with brunch. I little more trendy than i usually like. Was greeted at the bar quickly and ordered the recommended bacon egg lettuce and tomato and a coffee. They feature a lot of wines for 5 until 5. Not fast by any means with the food so don't go here if you are in a hurry. When it came out delivered by a guy who might have been a manager i asked for more dijonaise. After eating half i knew he blew me off. The bartender ordered it but still had to wait. Food was good not great but came with a nice fruit bowl. I won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"I come here very often for wine and bruschetta. I've tried all of the different bruschetta they have and you honestly can't go wrong with any of them. My favorite is the Burrata, Bacon, Arugula and Tomato. Each piece is loaded up and deliciously fresh!! My new favorite wine here is the Last August which is a Sauvignon Blanc 2016. The service is always great and the vibes are chill!"}
{"text":"Visited from out of town. Cool vibe and very friendly service. Food was just ok though. A bit pricey for sandwich, soup, bruschetta, etc. Great beer and wine options."}
{"text":"I have been here at this place a couple of times and it was always an honor to visit this place. They have such a nice environment there at their restaurant, the bar is great too with friendly people. I met a couple of people here which is also a plus why I like this place :) highly recommended."}
{"text":"I'm giving these guys a 4 out of five. Service is excellent food is amazing. I have had their Gluten feee panini and their BRUSCHETTA! Amazing, Amazing amazing!! They bake their own bread and yes the Gluten Free bread is spongy and doesn't crumble! I would have given them a 5 but they don't carry crafted drinks. Simply wine....I wasn't  in the mood for wine. I think they can take their place to another level if they offer crafted specialty drinks."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch, pretty nice laid back place.   Me and my buddy really enjoyed the bruschetta board sampler. Probably the best. My favorite was the prosciutto and fig:-)  We ordered the half panini and salad as our meal. My nine iron was pretty good, I liked my raspberry chicken salad better. With appetizer and meal, felt like I ate a light meal but I was really full. Good and delicious:-) . I think the bruschetta stole the show.   Overall experience was pretty nice. Servers and ambience pretty nice. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Update:manager came out and all was well :) 3 bartenders  2 empty glasses  Nothing. They literally pay NO attention to customers at the bar."}
{"text":"Love this place with the girls on Tuesdays! $20 bottle and boards + friends and laughs = happiness!!! Music is a little loud for conversation sometimes but what can you say it's a happening place on a Tuesday! :)"}
{"text":"Hands Down My Favorite Spot In Scottsdale Right Now!They Have Great Wines To Pair With The Delicious Bites.Perfect Place To Go After Work And Unwind With A Drink Or Two. Outdoor Seating Is Just As Good As The Indoor. You Wont Regret Going!"}
{"text":"This place may be my favorite Postino.  Why, you ask?  First of all it's super close to where I live.  Secondly, there's plenty of non-valet and non-metered parking.  Thirdly, the bar is large and wraps around three sides so you aren't just staring at the wall.  The food at all Postinos is always good.  I really like the salmon and the salami bruschettas.   Over the years they have really stepped up their craft beer selections which is much appreciated.  This last visit I went with a chardonnay from upstate New York and it was great."}
{"text":"Service was not nearly as timely as usual... all tables around us on the patio we're experiencing this sub par service during their rush around 130 (which seems like an odd time but maybe it's because of the holidays)."}
{"text":"I would say this is just a little better than their other location (which is great as well).  Had a good meal and some delicious vino ... went by myself to get away from the family for some \"Dad\" time.  Was able to eat in peace and enjoy a nice relaxing lunch.  Then real life kicked in again.    Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I love me some Postino and this location is no exception... You can't go wrong sitting solo at the bar, dining with a partner or several, or heading over with a more sizeable group... I've been to this location with each of these scenarios, and I've almost always had a positive experience.   I cannot bear to give any Postino location less than four stars since I love their food and wine so much, but the service has admittedly been a little spotty at this location.  On several occasions, my drink has been forgotten, service has not been attentive, nor has a GM been apologetic.  I hope that the staff at this Highland location will get a little bit better with customer service like their other locations.  Regardless of service, my go-to favorite menu items are the bruschetta board with the following: -apple & brie -prosciutto & fig -salami & pesto -artichoke spread -salmon  I also love the mixed green salad add protein of your choice.  Wine selection is awesome and ambiance is perfect for any scenario.  They make a mean Arnold Palmer as well.  So now you see that even with some spotty service at this Postino location, I'm still a devoted fan... cheers!"}
{"text":"Go for the bruschetta boards and happy time!! Prices are right and food delicious."}
{"text":"They told us one hour. It was closer to two. Waited another 15 for service. I understand it is crowded for the board and bottle deal, but the crowd needs to be managed in a way that's more accurate to customers in terms of commitment made and that deals with tables in a way that aids in assuaging the insane wait. Your servers can't really do anything so this isn't a reflection of service, rather the poorly managed expectations and wait. Otherwise, service is strong and food is perfectly acceptable.  UPDATE: Raul, the manager at this location, completely reacted in a gracious and constructive way that made us all feel positively about Postino and rectified the situation. He came to our table and chatted with us about what had happened, which makes me feel optimistic not only about the quality of the restaurant but also about this issue being improved in the future. I will continue to return because of what he did tonight. Additionally, Ameya, our server, was excellent, attentive, and sympathetic. It is these two people that mean my review is going from 2 to 5 stars. The service recovery that happened here has created significant loyalty in our group and I hope the feedback about managing expectations via underpromising and over delivering in the future truly is productive. Thank you Raul and Ameya."}
{"text":"I had a fantastic time hear with a group of ten friends. Jordan was our server and he was attentive and funny. The food, drinks, and atmosphere was great. This location is larger than most of the Postino locations which is why I chose this location for my large group.  My only compliant was that I made a reservation 4 days in advance and my party of ten was unable to seated inside where we had reserved for over 20 minutes and ended up having to be seated outside. It was quite warm that evening but we made the best of it."}
{"text":"So I came in yesterday right before happy hour was over. I love that postino has wine on special all day.. I had been into this location a few times but have never sat at the bar. I sat at the bar and the bartender that helped me was Derek. He was so attentive. He offered me a wine called verdicchio. Omg it was so good. I have never had a wine like that. I also noticed he helped a lady that looked like she had a bit too much to drink to her taxi.. such a nice guy. The whole experience was awesome and I love the chicken mozzarella panini. I'll be back soon and with friends"}
{"text":"People that work here are so nice. I had to change a reservation three different times and each time the staff handled it very nicely.  I was embarrassed the third time but they couldn't have been nicer. I love their food. They're bruschetta is amazing. They do a great job and their restaurant has a great patio."}
{"text":"This place continues to impress me every time I come here! The service was 10 times better than when we first came here when it opened! Get the Brie a bracuto sandwich it's so good!"}
{"text":"First trip to this location. Food was just as good as the others around the Valley. Hard to beat the bruschutta boards, and I don't know why you'd order anything else. Our group was super impressed with the amount of wine knowledge the girl who brought out our bottle had. Not sure if it's a personal interest of hers, or she was trained by Postino's, but she had extensive info and chatted w/ us for a while about several different wines. Their back patio is quieter than I expected, seeing how close it sits to Scottsdale Rd. Definitely be back!"}
{"text":"BACKGROUND  Well, let me just say that Postino owners, the DeMarco couple and Bailey couple, co-owner's of LGO Hospitality sure have a grip on restaurants AND social media.  As per usual, I'm never oblivious to social media trends and where Yelp sends it's minions, and it's no accident they've been sent to all of the LGO Hospitality venues (including Chelsea's Kitchen and Buck & Rider) and all of five of the Postino's.  It's due to the fantastic vision of it's co-owner Craig DeMarco.  Craig DeMarco is responsible for some of the Valley's best restaurants, including Postino, Windsor and Federal Pizza. As founding partner of Upward Projects, he, along with founding members Kris DeMarco (Craig's wife) and Wyatt and Lauren Bailey, have brought a dozen restaurant projects to the Valley.   Their passion re-purposing classic Valley buildings and invigorating neighborhoods, such as North Central Phoenix, Arcadia and downtown Gilbert has not gone unnoticed.   They're killing it and I am a fan.  THE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCE  When I first visited Postino's Highland 10 months ago, I IMMEDIATELY LOVED it. This location is my favorite, although I also love the ASU location.  It's just cool and sexy. I feel happy here.  I've been all different times of day and night, and it's just fun.  My last visit, I went with my BFF Whitney. We shared one of their bruschetta boards and had some wine.  I've tried almost everything on the menu, and I've never had a bad meal.  The offerings seem simplistic but have a sophistication and maturity to them.  The wine list and draft beer selection is impressive.  And the service is ALWAYS on point.   CONCLUSION  Does it seem like I'm promoting Postino's Highland?   Well, yes, I am.  That's because I'm very selective and I can't find anything bad to say.  Isn't that what Yelp is for? To promote businesses that we've enjoyed?  4/5 RECOMMEND  OF NOTE  *Plenty of parking out front.  *For more information: postinowinecafe.com"}
{"text":"I have been impressed by all of Postino's establishments but Postino Highland is definitely the one I go to most often. A great place for an Instagram worthy lunch or a wine night with friends. Also don't forget to check out their $20 bottle and board special on Tuesdays! I usually switch between getting the Nine Iron Sandwich or the Bruschetta. The last time I was here I went with the Bacon Burrata (no burrata lol), hummus and tomatoes, Smoked Salmon, and Salami and Pesto Bruschettas and they were all fantastic. First time trying an starter board from there and it was pretty tasty. Creme Brûlée was good but not the best I've had, though I'll probably get it again. Overall a great dining experience and I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great new location and much bigger then I thought it was going to be, also there was plenty of parking (no valet required!) Bruschetta was amazing as always the only wish I have is that they put some more dinner-like dishes on their menu (something warm maybe pasta:)"}
{"text":"We had such a great time this Saturday. The wait wasn't long and they seated us quickly. The service was great and the food was amazing. I really enjoyed the atmosphere, it's fun and outgoing but also is a little fancy great for a date. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great wine, atmosphere and food. Service at the bar is hit or miss, there always seem to be several people behind the bar, but often more interested in conversing with each other than greeting people who sit down or taking their order. I often have to wait 5-10 min before even being acknowledged. Besides that issue it is a great place!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE coming to this location and can't say enough great things! The food is delicious, the service is A+, the interior is hip, and the wine.. GOTTA LOVE THE WINE! This location is a great choice for a date night, girls night, happy hour, etc.! Postino, see you soon!"}
{"text":"I almost gave up on this place but i went back tonight for one last try for one of my favorite dishes and this place has done a 180.  Im assuming there was a management adjustment here.  The staff seemed to be happy again and everything came exactly how i asked and in a timely manner considering the amount of patrons. My waitress came by frequently to check on us and I had a very pleasant conversation with a gentlemen named Raul.  He recommended 2  very good wines and after a sample of each i couldn't decide which one i wanted because both complimented my plate nicely.  After a conversation with him I decided to go with a red that he recommended.  I could not have been more satisfied with the food and service at this location. If you love wine and plates that compliment, i HIGHLY recommend this place.  The staff is very welcoming, the food and wine selection is perfect, and the comfort level is extraordinary."}
{"text":"We went to celebrate my daughter's 13th birthday and Postinos did not disappoint. The bruschetta was delicious, especially the warm artichoke and the almond hummus with tomatoes. Lots of options for the vegetarian in our group which is a bonus. The $5 wine was great for the adults while the birthday girl enjoyed the cucumber honey lemonade."}
{"text":"What a gem! We enjoyed the $5 Happy Hour that lasted until 5! It seemed their entire wine menu and draft beers were included. The pour was generous and it was a small pitcher of beer  We had the Bruschetta Board with our drinks.   Brie & Apples with fig spread  Smoked Salmon with pesto We also had a fig spread and a spicy pepper jam that were both awesome!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. Hit the spot! I love their team service philosophy. Their simple but thoughtful menu makes this an A+ Phoenix classic. A shout out to our waiter Carlos and the rest of the team. Keep up the fantastic work!"}
{"text":"Great ambience, decor, outdoor patio and outstanding music.  They are known for their bruscetta and happy hour.  The bruscetta choices are great but have tried the bruscetta twice, with inventive combos.  Brunch was excellent with homemade rasberry jam and walnut toast.  Great service!"}
{"text":"Love it here! Definitely my favorite location.  Always good food, good service and good vibes. And the patio is great for people watching."}
{"text":"Finally decided to try this place out and was more than satisfied! Came on a Sunday and pitchers/wine by glass were 5 bucks each!! Hubby and I got a pitcher of the kilt lifter and then shared a bruschetta and a panini. I didn't expect to be full but it was all more than enough! The bruschetta board was SO good and I can't wait to go back and try more flavor combinations! We tried the tuna panini and it was definitely good! Can't wait to go back and try more! In addition to awesome food, service was pretty good too! No complaints!"}
{"text":"I think I have the menu memorized because I come here so often! This location has got to be my favorite, it's large and has plenty of parking. The wait rarely seems to exceed 15 minutes. Their happy hour has $5 glasses of wine and $5 pitchers of beer (and they had plenty of great options of both). The only downside is it ends at 5 pm so it's more of weekend deal for me. For late night, they have their $20 deal that includes a bruschetta board (4 kinds) and bottle of wine. Their bruschetta is the best in town (The roasted peppers with goat cheese and the artichoke spread my two must orders! I get them every time and then switch up the other two). The $20 deal is only offered Monday and Tuesday's after 8 pm. My favorite items on the menu are the butcher board (it's huge, perfect to split with another person), the turkey panini, and raspberry chicken salad."}
{"text":"I have loved Postinos since it first opened in Arcadia. I couldn't wait for it to open in my neck of the woods...Old Town Scottsdale. It was worth the wait. This place is fabulous. The food flavors are amazing (I had the delicious veggie panini), the wine list is unique and filled with an excellent assortment of tasty affordable wines, and the wait staff is friendly and helpful. Not to mention the place is beautiful inside. I am an Arizona native and once upon a time visited the old Valley National Bank this used to be in the 70's...I loved the retro feel and how they paid homage to the history of this venerable old building. Well done. Hands down my new favorite place for getting together with friends."}
{"text":"I was so excited to check out this new location and was a little disappointed with a couple of things. Came on a Wednesday night after the happy hour special so it was not that busy at the bar area.  It took forever to get my drink order.  I was able to get a seat at the bar and get my water right away but I waited almost 10 mins until one of the two bartenders asked for my order.  The second concern was while I was sitting at the bar I notice in that time frame, police had pulled 2 separate cars over, so although the location is great the cops were out that night.  So my suggestion is to Uber.  The outside patio looked very inviting I really liked the setup not sure if I'll be back to this particular location."}
{"text":"Solid place for wine and cheese boards. Great Food such as paninis, soups and salads.  Service was meh, I normally don't like my menu tossed on the counter in front of me.  I guess when you're soooo busy you do that kind of thing to your patrons.  $5 wines before 5 is their HH deal.  Food 3 stars service 0."}
{"text":"Our food and wine were delicious.. We would've given more stars but our server, Emily, was less than attentive, never cracked a smile and never came back to ask us our food was."}
{"text":"This is hands down our favorite Postino's location.  The food is always excellent and the service is consistently exceptional.  There is a reason it is usually packed as it it just that good.  In particular the happy hour is hard to beat with $5 pitchers of local craft brews as well as many good wines for $5 a glass.  Also, the Bottle and Board on Monday and Tuesday's after 8:00 is one of the best deals around.  We have tried pretty much everything on the menu and it is hard to go wrong.  The bruschetta boards are a must have and they mix up the choices by always having a seasonal option."}
{"text":"I've gone to different locations and they are all great! The staff is friendly and helpful. The food is great! On Monday and Tuesdays after 8pm they do board and bottle for $20. You get a whole bottle of wine (lots to choose from) and 4 different bruschetta's! I've gone with 3 people and we've shared 1 board and bottle and it filled us all up. I like this location in particular because it wasn't overly crowded. Usually it's 30 mins to an hour wait on Monday and Tuesday nights."}
{"text":"Fantastic!! It was a bit loud but food and wine was superb!! Love the variety of bruschetta's"}
{"text":"Been to the 'original', Central and Scottsdale Postinos' and they are consistence especially in the wines to discover. The consistent and responsible aspect I am told is due to one man -\"Brent' the beverage director and partner. I have attended -with my wine group- 2 hosted wine tastings recently where the winemakers are patient and excited to share. The food provided is same as on menu no corners cut, the water is always refilled and one does not need dinner after. The Mendoza tasting (Argentine wines) was palate expanding! Get on their mailing list so you do not miss out!"}
{"text":"Food and drinks are awesome. Plus $5 pitchers or glasses of wine before 5, can't beat that. However tonight when my friend and I were enjoying our dinner and wine, our server was just rude. She ignored our table pretty much the whole time. She had a stink face on the whole time and didn't even check in on us after we got our food. Thankfully the manager rectified the situation in order to get the restaurant my 4 star rating."}
{"text":"It's a great looking spot in a reclaimed midcentury building just to the north of Fashion Square Mall, and Safari Drive.  I feel the simplicity of this concept is evolving and not as simplistic as when the first Postino's  opened on Central. I am not complaining, it's still a very clean menu, with sandwiches salads a soup a few cheesy appetizers and of course the bruschetta. We also had the brunch menu to choose from and it looked yummy!  Everything I tasted was tasty especially my salad with pears, pecans and gorgonzola. I was a little underwhelmed by the bruschetta, and at $15.00 it seemed a little small.  Service was Clunky, yet friendly and professional. The issue I noticed was 2 servers were in service sequence back to back. It seemed like one didn't know someone had started the table, and then returned again to mimic the other servers sequence of service.  The walnut tables are beautiful however drinks were served without napkins or coasters and our table was wet all over the place. I finally mentioned the issue to our server and a cocktail napkin was deliverd to me only, and then removed with the next Ice tea refill.  It's a great concept with a pretty good perceived value. Check this spot out, and I will be back as well."}
{"text":"Love!!!!! First of all, I am a huge Postino fan -- Arcadia, Tempe, Phx...wherever! I love the food & atmosphere & wine of course. I love the layout, very open & the walls are covered in matchbooks, very cool. The service was great & everything came out as expected, delicious!!! I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Postino is my absolute favorite place in Arizona.  I'm always craving their bruschetta and wishing we had a location in SoCal.  I kept raving to my girlfriends how bomb the bruschetta is here so we stopped by before heading back to California.  This was my first time at this location and it was much better than the one I first went to in Phoenix.  Love how bright and open this location is and all the cute decor inside.  Perfect spot for any type of occasion!   We each ordered our own bruschetta boards and a cup of their soup of the day which was roasted red pepper w/gouda.   For my bruschetta board I chose: -Brie & apples w/ fig spread -Fresh mozzarella w/tomato & basil -Smoked salmon w/pesto -Proscuitto w/figs & mascarpone  The soup was surprisingly much better than expected!  I would definitely recommend getting a cup :)  Now the bruschettas.. They were all sooooooo goood. The Brie & apples one is more the on sweeter side but still one of my favs  and you can never go wrong with smoked salmon or prosciutto!  My least favorite was the fresh mozzarella because they used way too much basil.  I tried to eat as much as I could but I couldn't finish the entire board. We definitely over-ordered but no regrets here! I will be back."}
{"text":"I came to Phoenix for a little to visit my family here and they took me to lunch at this location. First off, the food was excellent! I got bruschetta and it was made perfectly and out in really good time. But the real highlight of the lunch was my server miree! She was so nice and attentive to us the whole time. I usually don't write these reviews but I was so happy with her service that I downloaded the app just to write this! I hope next time I'm in town she is our server again because I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"We walk here often with our dogs and sit in their dog-friendly patio. We really enjoy the atmosphere, and unlike other reviewers, the service has been good for us. We've been trying as much stuff on the menu as we can, so our bill is usually high, but everything we've tried so far (various cheese boards, bruschetta, salads, paninis) has been really good. My favorite is anything with that fig jam. Wish I had snapped some food pictures because the food presentation is just as good as it tastes."}
{"text":"Have been here at least 3 times for lunch and once for dinner. Food is very good; have had nine iron, chicken & mozzarella, & tuna panini 1/2 sandwiches with different salads. Each one delicious.   And the $5. Glass of wine is a great way to try new wines. No complaints here  What bugs me is the service. It's slow to respond and I have found unless I get up and go to the wait staff, they are no where to b found for long periods of time. And where is the person?  Clumped together off to the side talking with other staff.  It's happened every time I've been there  Hence, the 3 star review rating.  This is an easy fix, just train the staff to give better customer service"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere, the music is cool and fun! The food is wonderful, creative and traditiinal. Definitely my new favorite spot."}
{"text":"Mark and Chris were excellent. Told us about the different wines they featured, gave us some tastings and ultimately were studs. We have been at postinos many times at all of their different locations but today was just proof that this place is an AZ icon for us. Excellent. Why 4 stars...? because there's always room for improvement! Love yall!"}
{"text":"I have to tell you lately we've been going to Postino's Highland and there is the most amazing bartender slash server Derek that is so personable and definitely easy to remember. His service is always so knowledgeable and friendly. He is definitely the reason why we come into this Postino's. We have frequent other Postino's but by far his service is superior of all. The bruschetta board is amazing and the meat and cheese board is to die for. Thank you Derek for all your amazing service we hope to see you soon. Chris Birkett and Sarah squared. :-)"}
{"text":"Cant wait for my 2 eggs, bacon, walnut toast & Bellini! Sunday after 3 days of yogaaaaaaaa! Ha Awesome indoor & outdoor space in great location! Plenty o parking Did i mention the Bellini?"}
{"text":"Delicious. Delicious. Delicious.  Would like 1. Full bar 2. More light 3. More attentive servers Other than that, the food was great and ambience was very nice despite the fact I felt blind.  Prosciutto and Fig bruschetta was excellent. Butcher block to start was plenty for four. I should mention it  seems extremely casual, almost like home for some. I saw one guest with her shoes off and her bare feet up on her seat. Ew. C'mon."}
{"text":"Best postino location! The staff are friendly, wait times are shorter and the server thats also a sommelier is so sweet, informative and knowledgeable!! Great food as always!"}
{"text":"Went with a friend to try the new Fashion Square Postinos. Went with the \"Pick Two\" half salads half sandwich.  The place is huge, and nice inside. I miss the attentiveness and customer service of Postino Central, we felt this was just not up to par as far as food and service went. We waited a lot for drinks and check, bartender seemed stressed. The place was full, it was overall pretty good. May or may not go back. They do have a patio with misters if that's your thing,"}
{"text":"It's hot out.  Hot like the surface of Venus.  That said the patio here is great for the summer.  There is a ton of shade thanks in part to an enormous tree and numerous umbrellas.  The misters help too.    If you've been in the valley for more than a week you've probably been to Postino several times so the food and drink selections should be familiar.  I've never thought their food was great but the atmosphere and the drink specials ($5 pitchers of craft beer before 5PM!!) are tremendous.  This location is newer than the rest but everything else will feel familiar."}
{"text":"Marisa was an amazing server. We had a great experience at Postinos for my friends birthday. We loved all of our food! We will for sure be back and ask for Marisa!"}
{"text":"We had such a lovely evening at this Postinos one Monday evening. You honestly can't beat their wine and bruschetta board deal any where else. The atmosphere is so cozy and sweet, they even play great music. Our server was so nice I'm totally going to butcher the spelling of her name I'm sure but it started with an A and ended with an A. Please forgive me but I was drinking wine.  I'm only rating 4 stars because our bruschetta took 50 minutes to come out.. They handled it very professionally though, the manager even brought out a hummus plate that was SOGOOD!! It was cooked cold veggies with a side of hummus and ranch dips. If you like hummus plates you haveeeee to try this one. We were instantly in a better mood. :)  The bruschetta I think actually first almost dropped to the wrong table and then wasn't caught right away. We understand that stuff happens but can't really mess with me when I'm hungry!  Overall will DEFINITELY be back this place is awesome!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best service I've ever had. We show up for a dual birthday to a lost reservation. While waiting in the lobby we decide to order some wine, to have it served and complementary. Followed by excellent table service. Great recommendations, patient staff, everyone is smiling and abundantly friendly. It's rare to find such amazing service. Thank you upward project."}
{"text":"This was our first time to this location, and everything was great. There was plenty of parking unlike the other locations, and the patio was really nice! Our server Aaron helped us pick a bottle of red and even let us try a few samples before choosing. The food was great as always, we love the bruschetta! Definitely returning to this spot soon."}
{"text":"Went in for Sunday brunch and everything turned out perfect besides 10 minute wait on beverages every time. Atmosphere was excellent!"}
{"text":"I agree with the first reviewer, what's not to love?! Postino has some of the yummiest food around and I'm excited to have an additional location nearby. :) Service is great - I had a wonderful experience with Tessa and the hostess that day even ran after me when I left my sunglasses behind on the table. Truly appreciate the good people and good food! Will be back often!"}
{"text":"Great comfortable setting and food was not bad given the price  5 of us at a total of $70.65 including a couple of Peach Bellinis  Service, at least at our table, could have been better.  The place was packed for lunch time on a Sunday.  I had their Tuscan Tuna Panini which was a good portion but I hated the chips that they served with it ... chips looked and tasted like Something that came out of a bag that had been sitting in a dry room for days   Probably will not try again if in the area"}
{"text":"Date night. Busy place for a newly opened Postinos.  Food was good. Wine was nice. What more could you ask of Postinos. Have been to several locations and they always do well for their customers. Nice choices, fresh food and nice beverage selections."}
{"text":"I came here with a few friends to begin our Saturday evening. The most one person in our group drank was 3 glasses of wine. We were approached by the manager towards closing time. She said that she was coming by our table to assure that none of us were driving and asked if we needed a cab called.... We told her no, that we were fine, but also asked if we seemed like we were drunk. She replied, \"There are some signs of intoxication over here, yes.\"   I'm sorry- but we are all grown adults who were not being eccentric or wild- just laughing, chatting, and having a couple of drinks. It was completely demeaning and embarrassing that the manager would accuse us of being intoxicated. Even if we were, that is not how you treat your guests.... Especially when we were literally the only table of patrons on that side of the restaurant. I've been to other Postinos locations that I have enjoyed, but this one left a very bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"This is the third time I've come here in the last few months to work on my laptop on there beautiful patio and the WiFi has not been working all three times. This seems like an unnecessary problem to have in 2018. I kee giving this place weeks in between visits for them to correct the WiFi issue... Please fix your WiFi issue so I can come to this beautiful spot to work and enjoy your wine and meals. I give this place two stars because this is not the first time the WiFi hasn't worked and staff seems shocked each time even though it hasn't been working for months. It's a decent spot, but just go else where if you have work to do."}
{"text":"Oh how I miss this place!  I sure wish they would come to Georgia!!   My daughter and I enjoyed the bruschetta (a must when you dine here) and the raspberry chicken salad.  $5 wine before 5 every single day of the week?   #heaven.  Beautiful outdoor patio at this location - can't go wrong here.  Keep it up Postinos."}
{"text":"I love Postinos! Especially their $20 board and wine. Everyone is always so nice and attentive, so service was great. Only thing is that the wait time is long, but definitely worth it for how good the food and service is!"}
{"text":"Not sure how long this Postinos has been open but WOW.... long way to meet the high bar set by Postinos Central!!!  Server, although kind, was lack luster in getting us what we needed, filling water glasses, taking our order, picking up dirty plates, last but not least waited 7 min for him to come and pick up our payment to process.  Picture is of our table when we were leaving!  Postinos central would not leave their tables like that.    Perhaps this is what happens when they try to replicate a great thing and duplicate it?  It's just not the same!"}
{"text":"Friendly and cool service- every staff member is your server.  Manager Tim (?)- he wears a St. Jude's Children's Hospital pin as he's a volunteer- is so friendly and sweet, that he sent Mom and me home a couple of weeks ago with a gift to celebrate our new build contract after our realtor treated all of us to a bottle of Moscato d'Asti, a bruschetta board, a Tomato Caprese, and a Butcher's Block.  Came here to have another glass of the sparkling Moscato and a bruschetta board, this time at the bar, with amiable, unobtrusive, and handsome server Bobby.    Had planned to go elsewhere for pizza, but construction kept me from going there, so Postino's it was, and I'm glad I came.  Note to self: Mustn't eat so much-- a gorgeous couple invited me to try their exquisite-looking Grilled cheese app, but I couldn't eat another bite!  Thank you, anyway!"}
{"text":"I will say my estimated wait time was spot on, however I didn't need to be argues with when I asked for a table not on the patio. Normally I'm pretty open but it was chilly this particular evening and no jacket in tow. \"well it is right next to the heater\" I was told... Will be weary to come back for a while to this location."}
{"text":"I thought the mediocre service was a fluke the first time. I have been here two times since, and it was just okay, even when it wasn't crowded at all. The food is amazing, though!!! Their bruschetta boards are excellent, and so are their sandwiches. I haven't tried much else yet, but it is worth checking out for the food."}
{"text":"I've always been a huge fan of the postino on Campbell... they have moved the same excellent food and service to Scottsdale Rd next to the Fashion Square mall.  Had a lovely lunch there. My only complaint was that the noise got a little loud towards the end of the lunch...but otherwise excellent."}
{"text":"NomNomz: 4/5 Service: 5/5 Libations: 4/5 Ambiance: Casual, trendy  POSTINOS IS MY HOME AWAY FROM HOME!! The old town location is definitely the larger of the locations and definitely always poppin! This place is super low key, but has enough energy to keep you coming back for more. The ambience is always on point, and the lights go down as the sun goes down, so it's perfect for a fun night out with the girls or an intimate night with a date.  There's a few locations to choose from around Phx/Scottsdale. The first location sprang up in Arcadia in 2001, so I don't think they're going anywhere anytime soon. And props to the owners, total rockstars!! The original location was bought from a vacant post office, so the name Postino emerged from the Italian word for \"postman\" so it has a unique history for sure.   Libations: Postinos is perfect for lunch or dinner any day of the week, or my favorite...Happy hour! Every day, you get half priced wine AND bottles until 6pm. You can't beat that. They have some really great selections, so it's fun to try the nicer selections at 50% off.   Nomz: I think most people would agree that Postinos is known for their bruschetta boards. What can I say, they're all pretty much to die for. My favorite hands down are: Smoke Salmon w/pesto (I always order double because this one goes so fast), Sweet and spicy pepper jam with goat cheese, roasted pepper with goat cheese, salami w/pesto and my friends always love the burrata and Brie selections, as well (you choose 4 for $15). Oh, and sign up on their email list and you'll get a free bruschetta board your first visit.  They have some yummy salads and sandwiches to choose from if you want more, and select soups. Brussel sprout salad, or Tuna Nicoise are my two faves, and you can never go wrong with the NYC grilled cheese and tomato bisque (all prices range from about $8-$12).   Service: In my experience, always phenomenal. I've had great service at the tables, but also love this location for their larger bar seating area. They clearly take their time hiring the right team, everyone is always prompt, polite, so friendly and highly knowledgeable with all the wines. I never have any complaints.   Overall experience: Perfect. I'm a regular and always have a great time. Whenever my friends visit me from out of state I alwaaaaays bring them to Postino's for their chill and fun atmosphere - and great wine selection! Everyone is always super friendly here, I always end up making new friends whenever I go."}
{"text":"Loved their brushchetta board!!! Lots of different flavors and combinations to choose from but they're all so yummy i can't wait to try them all! The ricotta with dates and pistachio was probably my favorite! Very light and sweet. We also ordered the smoked salmon with pesto, the prosciutto with figs and mascarpone and the sweet and spicy pepper jam with goat cheese! Also the cucumber honey lemonade was probably one of the best lemonades I've ever had... And wines and other beverages for $5 before 5 whhhattt. The restaurant itself was also very aesthetically pleasing and the wait staff made sure we were enjoying our lunch. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food is great. We had the Brussels sprout salad and chicken salad. Very fresh and amazing flavors. Service was a bit off - seemed like our waiter went on recess after we were seated."}
{"text":"Met up with a friend for dinner but the wait was 45 minutes long...why the 5 star? Well let me explain, we went to the bar to wait...while there we were able to get a bottle of wine and appetizers. Service was quick and the bartender was always alert to anyone ordering though house was full. The atmosphere is lively in a good way. By the time our table was ready, we're were full with appetizers and the wine. So we skipped it...a meal by that time would have been too much. Really enjoyed the evening."}
{"text":"I've been to most of the Postino's in the Phoenix area (maybe all?) and they're all delicious & have excellent service and this location (which funny enough I had never been to even though it's the closest one to where I live) is no different.   One thing that's a little interesting about this location is that it feels a little \"homier\" to me than some of the other ones (more booths is the main thing I guess), which I'm a little surprised by given the location.   In addition to the usual bruschetta board (this time it was artichoke spread/roasted pepper & goat cheese/salami & pesto/prosciutto & mascarpone...all excellent of course) I also split a mozzarella & tomato salad w/my mom. It was delicious...especially the dressing.   I love that Postino does $5 glasses of wine before 5 pm and since I was with my mom we did a bottle of of Stagedive for $20. Excellent wine, and and excellent deal!"}
{"text":"I Like Postino for business lunches. i have had several here and always great food, quick service and a good place to work. The brussels sprout salad is great with some amazing cheese on top. Love their iced tea too!"}
{"text":"Another Home Run !! Wonderful staff and great food. You thinking of opening a business, follow their business plan. Each location runs like clockwork. An awesome experience each time at every location !! An absolute pleasure. Juliana, Jordan,Emma.and Jeff were great as was Chip the manager.. Doing yourself a disservice if you don't come in !!"}
{"text":"Finally visited the famous postinos for Friday date night. We arrived at 6:30 and were seated by 7:10. It took a while for a waitress to address our table.  The crowd was very young, loud and rowdy. I would prefer the Arcadia or Kierland location for an older crowd. Wine selection was great, bruschetta board was superb! We also ordered a panini and salad.. Wasn't crazy about the chicken mozzarella panini or the Hanahs field salad. We also ordered the lava cake for dinner which was yummy, but my husband said it tasted like pure cocoa powder to him... Overall pretty good. We will try the brunch next time, see if that tickles our fancy lol"}
{"text":"Went for happy hour and the wine is only $5 a glass! Then we shared 4 bruschetta and all were really good! Our favorite though was the salmon. Great atmosphere and outside patio seating. The staff was awesome and it was a great night. Highly recommend to all of you who like to sit and chat over finger foods and good wine."}
{"text":"Postino's is what dreams are made of. I have only lived in Scottsdale for one month and am already turning into Bruschetta. Monday and Tuesday nights they have a special for a bruschetta board and a bottle of wine for $20. The staff there is always lovely. I will continue to visit this place on a weekly basis."}
{"text":"Great spot to hang out and people watch. Definately come on monday or tuesday for 20.00 bottle of wine and bruchetta.."}
{"text":"Postinos is a regular go-to for me, particularly for $5 glasses of wine before 5pm. Dreamy, I know. My friend and I landed here before our spa day at Spa Lamar that's about a 10 min walk north. We sat on the patio- being there around 11am, it was a little chilly, but the attentive staff got the fireplace on for us, which definitely added to the experience. We ordered bruschetta ($15 for 4 options) and 2 salads- raspberry chicken salad and the first one on the menu. All were perfect. Top picks for bruschetta: apple and Brie, salami and pesto, fig and marscapone, and artichoke spread. Also enjoy the burrata with bacon. Wine picks: Last August Sauvignon Blanc and Stagedive Pinot Noir. Fun bar situation here too!"}
{"text":"Let me start off my saying i absolutely LOVE everything Postino does. Their food, wine, and atmosphere is all incredible. I have been to almost every Postino location in the Valley. I have always had exceptional service, however at Postino Highland I unfortunately did not have a good customer service experience. Our waitress was extremely rude and very unwelcoming. Didn't say more than 2 words to me and my friend the whole time. She didn't even come over once to ask if we needed anything or how our food was. I will most likely not be returning to this location, and go to Postino Central where i've always received amazing service. Still giving Postino 4 stars because of their great food, but taking one star off for the bad service."}
{"text":"My fave happy hour spot !   Before 5 PM all wines and pitchers of beer are 5 dollars! Everyday! However if you can't make the happy hour, still worth a stop in for their delicious treats of bruschetta and boards.   The veggie sandwich is a delight!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for wine with some friends and had amazing service from Whitney the bartender.  Food is always great, love the pops of yellow throughout the place and all the natural elements.  Will certainly return, love the ambiance.   5/5"}
{"text":"I've been to all the other Postino's in the Gilbert, Arcadia areas. This location was the first for me. Excellent location, private parking lot and the service and food is just as good as all the other locations.  My friend and I had the Bruschetta Board of 4 and we shared the Tuscan Tuna Panini with homemade chips. Note: I love their Tuna Salad because it is a non Mayo based, delicious!  Excellent service, great food, nice location!"}
{"text":"The location is great. They seem to have some growing pains, but I'll be back. I had an issue with my food order and they were very quick to offer a replacement. I declined the replacement and they took care of a bottle of wine instead. Like I said, we'll be back."}
{"text":"Monday's are meant for bottles and boards! $20 for a bottle of while and bruschetta! Plus they can cork your wine for a different time"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with Postino and their bruschetta. Love that there's plenty of parking and no valet! There's some standing room around the bar for you to grab a drink while you wait for a table which is nice."}
{"text":"I love the ambiance and they always have a lively crowd and a full bar. The happy hour is good and their wine selection is sizeable. My only complaint is the white is never cold enough. It changes the flavor of the wine. One visit, we ask the bartender put our wine over a cup of ice to keep it cold. I know, it's Phoenix in the summer. but I'm not sure that should affect the temperature of the wine fridge. Overall, I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Bobby and Ashley in the bar were so amazing! My friend and I were there for hours and they kept us entertained and engaged with us all night! They handled a very busy bar with ease. Great environment, drinks, food and even better staff. Thanks you two!  -Drea / Brandon"}
{"text":"I started eating at Postino when they first opened on 40th & Campbell. The food is consistently great and I have never had a bad experience ever!  The choices of wine and menu items are great although I order the same thing every time!  It's fun to have 4 choices for every bruschetta that you order.  I love them all and couldn't recommend one more than another!  It's a great choice no matter what location you choose!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place.  I love the atmosphere and fun time when I go. The bottle and board nights are my favorite. Everyone always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for food, drinks and atmosphere.   I fell in love with the first bite. Each variety of bruschetta is sure to enliven every sense. For example: the bread slices look Intagram-foodie worthy, tastes fresh, smells fragrant and full flavored, feels crunchy yet soft and each possible selection sounds amazing. Try all of them! If you are gluten sensitive/celiac the gf bread is delicious.   Their caramel ice cream dessert is a must.   Service was friendly and cheerful but it was also slow and lacking."}
{"text":"So happy Postino made it to this side of town!  Like others have shared: same delicious food, great service, and plenty of top notch wine/beer options.  The atmosphere and playlist were perfect for a laid-back Saturday afternoon.  I'm looking forward to frequenting this new neighborhood location."}
{"text":"A visit to Postino is a MUST for anyone visiting me from out of town. Their bruschetta is amazing. I mean I love bread, but this is taking it to another level. Not your typical restaurant bruschetta, there are sweet and savory flavors and something for everyone even vegetarian options! My favorites are the salmon pesto, prosciutto mascarpone and bacon burrata. The Apple Brie option is great as a dessert to end your bruschetta board. They have an excellent deal on Monday and Tuesday nights, a bruschetta board and a bottle of wine for $20. What you don't finish they will recork and you can take it home!"}
{"text":"Came here unexpectedly and left full and happy. We thought there would be pasta options on the menu,but was surprised when there wasn't. That didn't stop us from having a delicious dinner. The bruschetta was amazing. Our favorite were the original tomato, basil, and mozzarella. I also had the chicken pesto panini, yum yum yum soo good! The Brussel sprout salad was beyond amazing! Def be coming back!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much! coolest atmosphere, awesome decor, and quality dining experience! truth be told I have only come here for the \"bottle and board\" special they run Monday and Tuesday after 8:00; its $20 for any bottle of wine and a board of bruschetta!  (some bottles alone can cost $50 without special)  I bring anyone who visits from out of town here, so far all have loved this location!"}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite Postino location! It is spacious, with a big bar and a really nice patio. The staff is really sweet and attentive. We had one friend who is gluten free, so they made bruschetta on gluten free bread. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Came at 5:15 looking forward to HH; nope- HH ends at 5pm because they  \"encourage day drinking\".  Bummer, so we went somewhere else."}
{"text":"This past Saturday I planned a Bachelorette dinner at this location and it was amazing! The food, service and ambiance was everything we were looking for. The amount of yummy food we got for the price was a steal! I highly recommend hosting a large party at this location, they will treat you like royalty! Thank you for a great time."}
{"text":"Best Postino yet!! Fantastic space with multiple patios & the same great atmosphere that we've always loved about Postino Arcadia. Big thank you to Craig & Upward Projects as we've been begging for a Scottsdale location for years!!"}
{"text":"Perfect little wine bar for a girls afternoon lunch or happy hour. You have to try their cucumber honey limeade. And one of the prosciutto platters. Stop in and say hello to Heather one of my favorite bartenders and wait staff great personality and always a great smile"}
{"text":"Love this place - we're here for brunch today and everything was delish! Service is impeccable, restaurant is well appointed and food is fresh, tasty and beautiful! We love this place for weekend brunch, and sitting on the aortic when the weather is nice! Postino is the best!"}
{"text":"Postino's is the perfect restaurant for a a girls outing and a night of wine and bruschetta. Although the menu is fairly limited, the bruschetta more than makes up for it. I ordered a board, hoping to select my favorites for future visits and for me, the smoked salmon, prosciutto, and ricotta options were the true winners while the brie & apples felt too sweet and ended up being my least favorite. All in all, a dependable and delicious option."}
{"text":"So excited that this has opened up in Scottsdale, it is a great conversion space with the great Postinos fare we know and love! parking here is my most favorite thing as there seems to be plenty of it! The salads are superb and the service has been friendly and attentive!  Get there early as it is a popular spot!"}
{"text":"Had such an amazing experience on a Saturday night! Thank you so much to Raul, Carlos, Mairi, Bryan for being so good to our group of 8! We were seated on the heated patio and the food was amazing! I had the turkey panini and the house salad! For a pro tip, I would ask for oil and balsamic to dip the panini in! The food was so good but the staff at the restaurant really made our weekend! They were so accommodating especially because we may have been a little on the noisy side. Will definitely be coming back when I'm visiting again!"}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and was so happy to see this going up a few months back. Been in a few times and really enjoy the location. It's not unlike other Postino locations, amazing food and good selection of wines and beers. Great for large groups, brunch, outdoor patio, kid friendly, huge couch available for large groups, and amazing happy hour with large bar. Can't wait for fall to take advantage of the outdoor space even more."}
{"text":"If you want the best French toast ever, this is the place! Great ambience, excellent service.   A wonderful way to spend a Saturday morning having brunch. This is my favorite place for brunch.  They are consistent and never disappoint......"}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed Postino's happy hour. I did not try the new location here in old town Scottsdale until earlier this week. Then I find myself here again in a couple days. These are my two favorite bruschetta with a nice IPA"}
{"text":"This place was packed today especially at the bar. I didn't have a whole lot of time due to an appointment and was a little worried about what kind of service I was going to receive especially considering how busy it was. I couldn't believe I was in and out in record time! I had the sweetest bartender named jorden. Oh my god she was the best!! What an amazing multitasker yet I still had her full attention.  Food was amazing, staff and manager all were inviting and friendly. Will return and bring friends!! Thank you so much for making my day a little brighter."}
{"text":"Raul and his team have delivered an amazing experience each time I have visited. The servers are highly knowledgeable and provide educational background to each of the wines we ordered. They were extremely attentive and didn't miss a beat.  The selection of wine for every price range is unbeatable. The bruschetta and butcher boards are outstanding, every flavor I try I love and the $20 nights are a STEAL!  The art and detail of each location is amazing. Love the atmosphere and the staff here.  Wish I could come every day!! If you haven't been, you're missing out majorly!"}
{"text":"I couldn't say enough great things about this location. I was in last night with some girlfriends and we ended up waiting quite a bit longer than our estimated wait time. We had multiple servers, and hostesses apologize. Someone came by and apologized again when we were finally seated and gave us olives and a card for a free bruschetta board for next time. It was greatly appreciated.   Everyone here is attentive and it's a well-oiled machine of wait staff."}
{"text":"My friend Tiffany and I went there for dinner on a Friday night and we had McKenna as our server and she was fantastic and so helpful and knowledgeable about the menu and wine list. The manager, Chip, came by and chatted with us and made us feel so welcomed! We definitely come back to this one, it's our new favorite! It's perfect for a girls night! And I'm totally coming back for date night with my hubby! Five stars just isn't enough! You've outdone yourself with this location."}
{"text":"I called ahead and asked about the wait time and the manager Tori answered and was very pleasant on the phone and helpful with the questions I had. We got to the restaurant and the wait time wasn't long at all. We were seated shortly after we put our names in and our server Brianna was absolutely incredible! She was very attentive and kind the entire time. Her and Tori made our first time to the Highland location one of the most memorable and amazing first time experience! I highly recommend going there and you would be lucky to meet Tori or have Brianna take care of you! I will be back and hope they take care of me again!"}
{"text":"Another location to love! Postino Highland is uniquely its own with their match box wall, large bar, and large indoor/outdoor seating. I absolutely loved coming to this location and of course the food was just as amazing as ever!   We got a board of bruschetta. My favorites are the Brie & Apple as well as the Roasted Red Peppers and Goat Cheese. We also had their sparkling Rosé which was soooo good! Definitely recommend!   Wish I took pics :( More excuses to come back ;) Service was SPECTACULAR. My water was never empty ;) Great job Upward Projects on another AZ favorite!"}
{"text":"I recently relocated from Charlotte, NC to Scottsdale, AZ a few weeks ago, and the hospitality I have experienced from Raul S. and his staff has been beyond spe. The after 8pm wine and bruschetta specials are on point. I'm so glad I found this gem! Cheers"}
{"text":"Awesome open air bar with a fantastic ever changing wine list.  Five dollars a glass for every wine until 5pm daily!! Food is always amazing and a great compliment to the wine as well.  I recommend the Brussels sprout salad--a must.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Talk about being cheep. No cocktail napkins are placed under any of the glasses. What happens? You end up drinking & eating on a bar full of water. Not very nice when your trying to wipe some of it up with a polyester napkin that absorbs nothing. What ever happened to cotton napkins that absorb?"}
{"text":"Postino was one of the first recommendations I received when I moved to Phoenix - for good reason! They have a killer $20 deal that includes a bottle of wine and Bruschetta on Monday and Tuesday after 8pm. Surprisingly, I don't come to Postino for the wine, but for the Bruschetta. I'm more of a beer gal myself and there's $5 pitchers of beer during Happy Hour plus Bruschetta for the same price. (Also, for my fellow native East Coasters, they have Brooklyn Beer on tap! I nearly fainted when I saw it, this is one of my favorite brews, so it's easy to get your beer fix on here even amongst the wino's).  Back to the infamous $20 deal- it's simply Arizona locals' favorite because the Bruschetta is large. If you're picturing tiny little pieces of bread, no, magnify it to Arizona size- they are huge. Not only that, but the ingredients are very fresh. I've ordered both savory and sweet and they are all great. If I had to pick a few to order, I'd say I always re-order the Sweet & Spicy Pepper Jam with Goat Cheese as well as the Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios. I can't think of another occasion where I can have spicy jam on bread with goat cheese, but at Postino's I can, and it's delicious.  In addition to their fare, the ambience is great, too. There are little details at Postino like the matchboxes on the wall that span decades, the neon yellow \"Weird is Rad\" sign and brightly lit chandeliers by the bar. And at this particular location, the restaurant used to be a bank in the 60's, originally designed by Frank Lloyd Wright's apprentice.  Oh Postino I've already hit up the Central and Highland locations, now I'm on to circling the next."}
{"text":"First time we've been here. Marissa was one of our servers and made the evening amazing. Very attentive and was always around right when we needed something. Food was great, ambiance great, Marissa made the night. Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite postino. Friendly staff and great service. I rarely have had to wait for a table!!! Obviously I recommend the bruschetta.. the butchers board is delicious as well!!  Wine selection is great and they have take home bottles of you are into that as well. Beer list is good too but you have to get wine when you are here :)"}
{"text":"The entire ambiance of this restaurant is amazing and the food and wine is even better. The bruschetta is a must get when visiting this place."}
{"text":"Like their happy hour specials. Close to home. Not what I'd call a relaxing environment but it's fun."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. Every time I come here it exceeds expectations. The food is always amazing. The service is what really sets this place apart. The manager really knows how to make you feel welcome and our server Claudia made our meal really special."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service!!!!  I highly recommend the bruschetta and vegetarian sandwich. I have been to a few different locations of postinos and this is one of my favorites. I love the decor and outdoor patio area. Whenever I am shopping at Kierland and want a bite to eat I stop here."}
{"text":"Postino's is one of my favorite restaurants. The food and drinks here are amazing. They use to have some servers that were not so good but recently it looks like they fixed that because everyone I encounter seems to be awesome. The happy hour they have every day is a deal that can't be beat. The Monday and Tuesday night special after 8 is also really good but it gets too packed then so not always worth it unless you don't mind waiting an hour. Overall, a 5 Star place."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Postino's! Ive been to most of their locations and they never let me down. This was my first time at this location, my family and I were at the mall shopping a decided to stop by for happy hour. This location is right across from the mall which is great for when your all done shopping and ready to grab a drink. The weather is finally cooling off so we were able to enjoy a couple bottles of wine on the patio. We also ordered the turkey panini which was very good along with one of their salads. I highly recommend their bruschetta, its great!"}
{"text":"I love Postinos. Awesome happy hours! My daughter goes to school at ASU and this is the first place we go after she picks me up at the airport. It kicks off our mother/ daughter weekends perfectly. The do have gluten free bread so if you have restrictions you still have the same options as every one. For $16.75 (gluten free version) you get a board with 4 delicious options. Love the smoked salmon one and the fig one. I always get those two then experiment a little for the other two. Great wine selection, good beer selection ( try the Kilt Lifter if visiting from out of town. You will be begging your local beer spot to carry it) and a very relaxing environment. It tells me vacation has begun every time! Makes me want to head there again just writing about it."}
{"text":"Food is ridiculous!  Great wine list and the customer service is fantastic.  The bruschetta board and a bottle of Mestizaje!  Check it out!"}
{"text":"This place has slamming bruschetta! Oh my god loved all the options! Great wine and cocktails. And the location used to be a former post office. Love buildings and locations with a story like that. Super fun and lively ambiance."}
{"text":"This was a fantastic experience! We went in at 2:00 p.m. We were greeted at the door and we wanted to sit at the bar. Our server, Marissa, came to take our drink order immediately. She was engaging and happily explained the beer selections of Pitchers for $5.00 and was knowledgeable about those, and the menu choices we were interested in. We ordered the Butcher's Block.  It is $15.50. That was an amazing assortment of varied meats and cheeses, with crostini. We substituted the hummus for cheese. There were also nuts and olives, dried cherries to compliment any drink you might have there. We appreciated not only that it was already \"Happy Hour\", but Marissa at the bar gave the feeling of Happy Hour vibe. We are going back!"}
{"text":"Feeling a bit speechless. I just had one of the best service experiences from a restaurant I have ever had in my life. I had come here, not been served right away, yelped a negative review about it, and was located by the general manager of the restaurant within forty five minutes later... Yes, you read that right...I have NEVER had much respect for  managers at restaurants from experience of working at a restaurant, but wow. Employees must feel lucky to be working for Chip (GM), as he is someone I would want to work for. This restaurant has completely changed my perspective on customer service at restaurants and how a place can be completely the opposite of your first impression. FABULOUS food, but you should come here for the service alone. Thank you Postino for a genuinely memorable experience."}
{"text":"My hubby and I love going to Postino Highland. The ambiance is always perfection. The food quality and customer service is pretty fantastic also. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Best bruschetta board in town! You can't go wrong with a little vino and delicious and flavorful bruschetta bites. We also love ordering the butcher board or the artichoke dip. Remember to go before 5pm to get $5 glass of wines. Yummmmm!"}
{"text":"The bruschetta boards are soooo delicious! I ate at all 3 Postino locations whilst in Arizona on a business trip. The vibe at the Gilbert location is by far my most favorite, it is located in the heart on downtown Gilbert, super hip! The ambiance at the Scottsdale location is very classy and quaint and the Phoenix location has a really cool city feel! They offer a very reasonably priced wine list. I highly recommend the Malbec by the glass. Love this place!"}
{"text":"His place is amazing.  Very laid back hipster vibe but the wine list is awesome and their specials you simply can't beat.  Bruschetta is on point"}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite places for brunch, happy hour, and/or dinner! I recently came here with my best friend to celebrate her recent engagement while I was in the Scottsdale area! We came here for lunch on a Friday afternoon and ordered mimosas (they are only $5 before 5 pm), Bruschetta (OMG...SO GOOD!), and the Brussels Sprouts Salad. For Bruschetta, we ordered one Brie and Apple with Fig Spread, one Prosciutto with Figs and Mascarpone, one Salami with Pesto, and one Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomato. My favorite one was the one with the prosciutto on top. Yummmmm!"}
{"text":"Hey. Guess what. There's another place with wine and bruschetta in Scottsdale. They have happy hour, small plates, fun lighting and a salad with goat cheese. They have \"up cycled\" furnishings, exposed fixtures, gorgeous servers and kale on the menu. Extremely loud. Very pretentious - like 753 other places in town.Overdone and nothing new. Also - terrible parking and music is insanely turned up. Time to think outside the organic, gluten free box and try something new."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of the Postino locations in the valley, but this one specifically has it down to perfection. It started with the hostess in the front who pulled up my reservation and understandingly, it was a soft opening and it was very busy so my guest and I sat at the bar. Right away, the manager, Chip, came over and introduced himself and welcomed us to the new location. He and the bartender, Justin, were extremely helpful with out food and drink decisions. Everything we ordered was absolutely FANTASTIC. The meat and cheese board was to die for and the bruschetta is absolutely amazing. From the moment you walk in, to the last bite of chocolate bouchon, I guarantee you will have an unforgettable experience."}
{"text":"I normally don't post reviews but I arrived at 2:00pm. I didn't even get noticed with my dogs for the patio until 2:15pm. It took another 15 minutes to get a server to ask me what I want to drink. Then multiple times the staff say they are going to get my dogs water, no water at the table 30 minuets later...  Food is good but service is not. Sunday afternoons are not extremely busy either. What made it a little more worse is that they were having a staff meeting across the outside area I was sitting in.   Loved this place, I hope it was a one time thing."}
{"text":"Great food and wine and awesome atmosphere. Love the $5 wine selection before 5pm. Food is goood too. Wish they stayed open a bit longer in the evenings!"}
{"text":"LOVE POSTINOS!! The food is always on par. Love love love the brie and prosciutto. Raul is incredible! Always takes care of you. Amazing. Thank you for always treating your customers like gold!!!!!"}
{"text":"Mom and daughter weekend would not have been the same without postino. We went to dinner around 7 on a Friday and had a quick wait but it was worth it. The bruschetta was delicious and the pub board was tasty as well and our wine was very good. We knew we had to go back the next day. So we headed down the next day for brunch. There was a little bit of a wait so we got a glass of wine at the bar and then headed to our table for a delicious breakfast, bruschetta, and more wine. Raul the manager was so friendly and welcoming and the service was as good as it was the night before. He informed us of Postino's catering options and we look forward to utilizing them for our next event. Such a fun place, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My friends and I visited Postinos for my birthday dinner. Our waitress was Marissa and she was fabulous. Very bright and cheery with great recommendations. I would highly recommend this place! The food and wine were great and we all left very satisfied!"}
{"text":"Food was great as always .l do not really like the vide at this location. I have been to every  location and am a frequent visitor to this chain. The staff was kind of snobby"}
{"text":"All locations do a great job of being consistent and, this being the first (I think), it does a great job setting the standard.  Before the new location opened closer to my home, I would come here all the time for lunch, drinks, or full dinner. Always a positive, calming experience!"}
{"text":"Nice location in the Old Town Scottsdale corridor. Very similar to all the other Postino's. They do a good job at what they do. Wish they had a little bit more of an extended menu and offered a full bar not just beer and wine."}
{"text":"Oooohh La La ! If I lived in AZ this would be my place. However, sadly I could only have one visit during my stay in the Phoenix area. But goodness how I loved you Postino! My girlfriend and I came for a light lunch here on Sunday and it could not have been a better experience! We found two seats at the bar and sat there.   Let me back up and say that this location itself is absolutely gorgeous. I love love love all the natural light and decor that takes place in this environment. The interior design gives such a classy and elegant feel without aging it.    One grand thing: $5 until 5pm for wine. This was an incredible revelation that I discovered. I ordered the sparkling Rose which was not sweet,but had the perfect amount of happiness to it !    As for lunch itself, Postino gives the option to choose a \"Pick Two\" sorta thing. I chose the half prosciutto and Brie panini with a chicken raspberry salad.  Both of these choices were absolutely superb!    So to be clear, Postino left me planning for the next time I can stop by. Cannot wait !!  Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"Went there about 430 and got seated right away. Our server was awesome (wished Id have gotten her name) greeted us right away and our drinks came out fast. We ordered and had the bruschetta with 4 types and we got 2 of those boards with 8 different kinds. Delicious! All of them. We got a panini with brie and prosciutto and a meat and cheese board. We ate everything! Bill was only 100 bucks for all that with 2 drinks each because happy hour is til 5. Just fantastic. We all really enjoyed it and cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"Highly disappointing that the kitchen closes at 11 yet you can't order anything within even 15 minutes before when online it says you're open until midnight. The service is such a disappointment every single time. Why bother?"}
{"text":"Another great Postino's in a wonderful venue. Same great food, wine, beer & service. Even has pkg (unlike LGNO)!!! Craig  & Lauren have a great formula!"}
{"text":"I love Postino and I have been a very loyal customer from the early days. Yesterday, I went to the Highland store for the first time. It's not the closest one to me, but I wanted to see what their awesome design team did with this iconic example of Modern Phoenix architecture. I've always loved how Upward Projects repurposes interesting, older buildings for many of their restaurants. This particular building is very special, especially for a modern architecture geek such as myself. The service and food were, as usual, very good. But when I asked the (dreamy) bartender who designed the building, he incorrectly told me Frank Llyod Wright. This building was constructed in 1967 and was designed by Frank Henry who taught at Taliesin West but never met FLW, who died in 1959. Details matter."}
{"text":"great food not feeling the two potbelly pigs eating with customers on the patio. Can you say health department violation"}
{"text":"The food was so darn delicious I had to ask the name of the cook. They said he went by Garrett and my goodness it really knocked my socks off! I've never tasted food this good before, I will come back not only for the wonderful atmosphere but for my new favorite cook Mr. Garrett! I am so impressed with how well your company hires because this food was phenomenal   Thank you Garrett!"}
{"text":"No Instagram filter is needed for pictures at Postino's. It lets off a vibe that seeps into your pictures that create a sense of unreal happiness that will make all your buds jealous.  Whenever I go here, say: for quick munch with friends after work; during the middle of the day for a rejuvenating mimosa; or even at night when I want a balance between romantic atmosphere and a crowd with a reservoir energy if things were to pop off - Postino's is always able to make each experience worthwhile.  It's quite spacious inside, but there may be issues with parking because Postino is one hot tamale in ol'Scottsdale. Once your inside though, the staff has perfected the customer service deal. Courteous in asking you how your day was, but cognizant that you want a seat quickly so you can get down to your business.  Every order I have gotten here has been solid. I typically go for the board of meats that starts with a C. I called it my Charizard plate because I can't remember the name of it and I feel like a Pokemon would relish the taste and the large portions they serve. But regardless of the name, you're gonna wanna imbibe as many fluids(alcohol) as possible with your meals to make the experience perfect.  This place is a solid high five."}
