{"text":"The staff is very rude and although the food used to be very good,  the quality has declined drastically over the last 6 months.  Of our last 3 orders, 2 were filled incorrectly, requiring us to return to get what we had ordered.  Neither time did they apologize.  We have bought take-out there for years, overlooking the unfriendly staff, but with the rudeness of the staff, order mistakes, and decline in quality,  there is just no reason to continue patronizing them."}
{"text":"This is the worst location of this chain that I have tried in the Madison area.   Unfortunately,  it is the only one in my hometown. I used to live on west side of Madison and all 3 locations I used over there I would rate 4-5 stars.   The DeForest  location however is no better than 2 stars based purely on quality &  flavor of food.   I have eaten there several times over the past 5 yrs and am happy with my order about 30% of the time. As others have stated,  it is a large menu and quick service,  but you eat food for taste. Crab rangoon used to be very good here,  now it's super bland. It's almost like they have switched to a different  supplier with more \"processed\"  mass quantity recipes."}
{"text":"We order from Chang Jiang often and have never been disappointed.  The menu is huge, and can accomodate anyone's taste buds.  The service is quick, usually ready in 10 minutes."}
{"text":"I really like both Chinese restaurants in town.  This one has outstanding crab rangoon.  Love the chicken with snow peas and mushrooms and General Tso Chicken.  Food is always ready in 10 minutes which is accurate.  Good place and they give you free pop."}
{"text":"Exactly what you expect from Chinese Takeout. Unenthusiastic young guy answering the phone, and a menu board over the counter that was put up in the 80's and hasn't changed since. Good food though! I always get the general Tso's and steamed dumplings. Doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"We ate here once about a year ago. It was the worst Chinese food I have ever had. I ordered Chicken mixed vegetables & my husband had beef & broccoli. Neither one of us could chew through our meat. Both the beef & chicken were so tough & fatty it was almost impossible to chew through. We literally threw out all of our food we ordered. If you're looking for good Chinese food in DeForest i recommend Sizzling Hut!"}
{"text":"Above average takeout with friendly staff. The sauce on the pan fried noodle is tasty. Dumplings are quite good."}
