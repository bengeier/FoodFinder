{"text":"Worst Indian buffet ever... Also biryani was the worst...I saw all the bad reviews but still gave it a chance...we should have known when the place was almost empty...the dishes were unclean..hopefully we don't get sick..this is THE piece of shit place as someone said in the previous reviews"}
{"text":"We were there for dinner pathetic service and horrible food Wish they kept the taste when I first ordered"}
{"text":"Oh my god.. a long long way to go. I understand that this is new place and it can be tough to start. But.. seriously they have to buck up. It was dinner time.. We were only 3 families in the restaurant and they took nearly 45 mins to bring our food. It was the same with others too. The food was ok.. just ok. Nothing extraordinary. Would have loved if this place did it better. Next time!"}
{"text":"Awful. Just awful.  I am an open minded vegetarian and was told to try this. What a mistake. Waited too long for a table. Just stood there like idiots waiting for a table.  THE PLACE WAS NEAR EMPTY!!! When seated the waiter spoke very broken English. Thats fine. A dear friend is from India and I have learned to decipher (?) what he is saying thru his thick accent. I'm cool with this. But FFS talk to us!! Didn't ask if we had questions, didn't explain anything. Had to Google EVERYTHING.  NO REFILLS.  Now. The food was wonderful it was the service and being stared at that sucked. Lets all stare at the tattooed white people. *smh*"}
{"text":"This restaurant does not deserve the harsh criticisms it has received. The garlic  naan was the best I've ever had. The pancake was flavorful as was the pakora."}
{"text":"Pathetic service. Ordered a biryani and a chicken curry and was only served biryani for 30 minutes with no signs of curry!! Goat Biryani was ordinary...curry when it came was ordinary too! Would not come back!"}
{"text":"Piece of shit restaurant. Please don't go ever. I and my wife fell sick after eating there."}
