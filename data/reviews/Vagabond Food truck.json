{"text":"Tasty food served fresh and hot! Fast service also. Only reason not 5 stars is its a little pricey. $10 for 1 beef burrito with the works (queso and rice). Don't mind paying this once in a while but in Pittsburgh I wouldn't be a regular customer."}
{"text":"Vagabond food truck is at the rivers casino for craft beer and food truck fest. A must have! Everything is unbelievably good. Just had a fantastic carnitas burrito. Friends had a barbacoa burrito her said was best ever. Quesadilla is also top of the line. I shit you not this is the best."}
{"text":"The service was great, the food is great, and I will definitely be back. I had the vegan burrito and he loaded me up where it was enough for two meals."}
{"text":"Michael is certified taco badass. All the food is good, including the salad, tacos, and burritos. Friendly face and delicious food."}
{"text":"Sooo good! I got the avocado tacos. More times than not the vegetarian taco option comes up short. Not this time! They were flavorful and delicious. I highly recommend them!"}
{"text":"Michael is an amazing chef with a vision to provide great food in a unique setting. The Vagabond Food Truck is a mobile 5 star culinary experience!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge Breaking Bad fan and absolutely loved this BB themed truck! The owner was awesome and the food was delicious!! Will definitely eat there again!!"}
{"text":"Super slow, my burrito was not even wrapped up tight like it should have been. I opened up the foil and it went everywhere. They didn't have any silverware or napkins. Good thing there were other food trucks nearby that i could grab a fork from them. The guy cooking the food was friendly but everything else was sloppy. For 9.50 it was not worth it. Will not be returning to this food truck. Wish I would have taken a picture but I was so hangry I didn't get to it."}
{"text":"Terrible! Don't waste your time!! He is giving other food trucks a bad name!! Nothing is home made, all store bought, says he's organic and he's definitely not. 

I order a barbacoa taco and there wasn't any barbacoa to it. 1st it was a cold corn tortilla, plain pork, shredded cabbage maybe some shredded cheese and then jarred salsa.  Call me wrong but I thought barbacoa is suppose to be smoked or \"barbecue like\" it didn't taste like that at all, tasted like just plain old pork. I ended up eating half and it and throwing it away.  

Save your money and go somewhere else for better Mexican. Ohh ps its cash only too.."}
{"text":"Vagabond was at Feastival this year. It was nearing the end of the night and I needed a little something to eat. Most trucks/stands were closed up, but Vagabond was still running. There wasn't much left after a busy day of vending, but I got a chicken taco that was really good! The owner was super friendly. I will make it a point to come back to try the pork."}
{"text":"The owner and chef were wonderful to us!  My kids have a rare auto-immune disorder that causes food allergies.  The chef and owner were great at making special food for them.  We saw them at the USC farmers market today.  It was almost closing time and they still made fresh guacamole for my girls.  It was great!"}
{"text":"Friendly owner and fantastic tacos. Strongly recommend the tacos al pastor which are fresh and tasty. Great selection with Tortas as well!"}
{"text":"SAVE YOURSELF AND DONT EAT HERE. Just because someone has a food truck doesn't make it good. Chef Michael makes the food truck scene look bad. 
My carne Asado taco, was some pulled meat (carne asado is never pulled) with canned nacho cheese and salsa from a jar can or jar. 

My wife literally spit her taco out of her mouth and into the garbage, and said \"this could be the most disgusting thing I've ever put in my mouth\". 
The sign saying certified organic is a crock. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO ELSEWHERE."}
{"text":"We specifically went to Draai Laag brewery on a steamy, 92 degree evening to have some delicious, wild yeast beer. And yet, the star of the evening happened to be the pescado taco from the Vagabond Food Truck parked in the lot. We had their guacamole: creamy and singly and perfectly done, the street corn: spicy with interesting notes of chillies and adobo, and the expertly crafted barbacoa and carnitas tacos. Great prices, friendly service and most importantly DELICIOUS food. Stop in, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Tried the Vagabound food truck when they came to my office today.  I got the pulled chicken taco and it was great!  They salsa was fresh and had a little bit of a kick behind it. The shells were the authentic soft corn shells that aren't always easy to find in the Pittsburgh area.  I'd recommend others checking this out when they are in the area."}
{"text":"I don't typically write reviews unless I feel moved. I first tried Vagabond's when I was just walking outside of East End Brewing company after a brewery tour. Michael kindly approached me and asked if I'd like to try a chicken taco. 

I'm from California, so we eat, breathe, live tacos over there. Sometimes our standards cause us to be skeptical of tacos outside of California. However, from this food truck in Pittsburgh, I was pleasantly surprised. Vagabond's taco is its own unique flavor. The chicken was shredded and was well complemented by the salsa, which was different from what I'm used to. Ingredients were very fresh with its own mild kick. It definitely hit the spot after knocking back a few brews. I feel like Michael's generous character translates into his tacos. That probably doesn't make sense with this buzz. 

Anyway, point of this post is that these are perfect to have with a beer! Thanks, Vagabond!"}
{"text":"Was at First Friday in Washington.  Had an excellent quesadilla.  Would definitely eat here again.  Love the Breaking Bad theme.   Heard others rave about the guacamole. Can't wait to try it."}
{"text":"Good tacos.  Watched as he heated the tortilla and made the tacos.  Had a barbacao and el pastor.  Both were good.  He asked if we wanted cilantro or chipotle cream on top.  The truck as burritos and tortas too."}
{"text":"Don't let the breaking bad theme fool you, It is absolutely terrible! The truck is very dirty. The service was just as bad and I won't be getting tacos from here and I would recommend anyone who sees this truck at a food truck lineup to stay away as well. Dirty workspace, bad food, rude workers, terrible experience!"}
{"text":"If I could give ZERO stars I would. We tried four different tacos and all were disgusting. Hardly edible and cold . Worst experience. It was a joke."}
