{"text":"Daruma continues to be one of our favourite restaurants. The food continues to be consistently fresh and delicious.The only complaint we had on our last visit on January 12, 2017 is that the food came too quickly from the kitchen and we felt a little rushed. This is not enough to change our rating. This time we tried Kaki Ponzu - Tempura oysters with Ponzu sauce. Delicious! Katsu-Don is still one of our favourite dishes.  I really like the plum and cucumber sushi - an excellent palate cleanser between dishes. The rainbow sushi roll was super fresh. We also had Yam Tempura and Gyoza which never disappoint. This restaurant is small and it is becoming more popular so please reserve!"}
{"text":"This tiny little restaurant has only 7 tables and about 6 chairs at the bar facing the chef. We went in on a Saturday night and managed to get a table. It was close to the door and there is no buffer from the cold so make sure you later up if you go in the winter and potentially have to sit near the front.  We were given two small appetizer dishes on the house, smoked salmon and kidney beans in a light sauce with sesame seeds. These alone could suffice me if they kept bringing more. The salmon was fresh, salty and thinly sliced.  They have quite a few tapas options to share, so we chose the calamari with hot dipping sauce, which was decent. The Daruma potato had the same sauce as the kidney beans, so it was automatically one of my favourites. Anything would taste amazing with that sauce. Next was the chicken meatballs on a skewer. Guess what? Also has some of that magic sauce.  The seaweed salad was the standard at all restaurants. The gomae on the other hand was the only disappointment. While I liked that they used shoots instead of the spinach leaf, the sauce was waaaay too sweet and grainy tasting.  The couple rolls we had were pretty run of the mill but fresh.  My one rainbow roll ( vegetarian) came with a \"special sauce\" which turned out to be thousand island dressing so I didn't bother with it.  All in all a pretty good meal with fantastic service."}
{"text":"Excellent traditional style Japanese restaurant with very reasonable price and high quality. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Very nice little sushi place! I had chirashidon and takoyaki for dinner, very fresh sashimi! Nice service and I enjoyed the environment. It's a very traditional style Japanese restaurant, small place but clean and I didn't wait long for my food (yah!)"}
{"text":"Went today as this was the previous location of Sushi Hibiki.  Just opened this past week.  Atmosphere is quite cozy and it's small hole in the wall but run by authentic Japanese.  As sushi restaurants go, it follows along the more traditional lines or sushi rolls and food rather than the fusion and I must say, the rolls were fantastic!  We also tried the Beef Tataki and was quite suprised at how simple it was, but also how flavorful it was.  Service was a tad slow with the rolls but given they've been open less than a week, I anticipate that service should improve.  If you're looking for good, authentic sushi, this is definitely a place try!"}
{"text":"A small intimate restaurant. Friendly staff. The food is very good and authentic. The fish for the sushi was fresh and of good quality. I've had my good share of Japanese food from Vancouver and I would recommend this place. The prices are very reasonable too. I'm lucky I can walk to this restaurant."}
{"text":"This restaurant is not the closest sushi place near my work, but is fast becoming one of my favourite.  The restaurant is located in the strip mall on Edmonton Trail at 1 Street NE, that also contains a Petro Canada, a liquour store, a pizza joint, a Caribbean Food place and much more.  Parking is a bit short for the type of uses at the strip mall.  A couple of times, I have been forced to park at the gas station parking stalls because there are none in front of the other establishments.  This location has been serving authentic Japanese cuisine for as far as I can remember (Cafe de Tokyo and Sushi Hibiki) and Daruma is the latest incarnation.  To be honest I have only been here for lunch and have had their bento boxes many times and also their chirashi zushi and ramen.  I like their sushi very much as they are fresh and well prepared.  The ramen was not up to par to be honest and probably not ordered by many people.  The server, as others have mentioned, is very friendly and made us feel at home.   The place is a little small and does not have many large tables.  If you have more than 4 people in your party, you should definitely call ahead to see if they can accommodate you by combining tables."}
{"text":"Nice to have relatively authentic Japanese food that is not all sushi rolls   Age dofu was yummy, sauces authentic and with fresh ground ginger  Chicken karage not crunchy and had no skin, a healthier Canadianized version perhaps  Mixed tempura, 3 shrimp (seemed skinny to me, long and skinny), 4 veg with authentic ponzu sauce   With tip $30  Excellent Japanese speaking service , small seating area 15?"}
{"text":"Visit Daruma for quick and very pleasant service and very good Japanese. It's \"hole-in-the-wall\" catch that you'll be glad to put in your repertoire.  The focus here doesn't seem to be sushi, although they do a great job with sushi if that's what you want. The menu is pretty interesting actually (but not crazy) with many tapas style dishes, very nice ramen soups, and surprisingly tasty teriyaki chicken. These are the things I tried. And I was impressed with it all.  The owner and chef(s) are friendly and seem authentically pleased to have served you. The servers are extremely attentive and also seem happy to serve you.  It is the combination of excellent service, interesting menu, happy chefs, and (as it turned out) very affordable price that makes Daruma an absolute winner.  (Note: I believe there has recently been a change in owners and chefs; some of the photos of menus and food may not now be accurate)"}
{"text":"The customer service here is great; feels like an authentic Japanese Izakaiya. Great sushi rolls and my favourite karage in town. Also quite well priced and only a stone's throw from downtown.   We came here yesterday for a few beers as well; I like the fact that all their beers are genuinely imported versus a lot it other Japanese spots which, while they carry Japanese brand beers, are locally made by third parties.  My only issue is that while parking is free there could be more of it given its nestled between a gas station and a few adjacent shops.   Its also a little hard to find but well worth it in my opinion.   Thanks guys."}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic Japanese food! Cute little spot with excellent service and very fresh fish. The lunch bento is great value and tasty!"}
{"text":"I happened to accidentally stumble into this place, which was close to the hotel I was staying at while on a business trip to Calgary. I was most pleasantly surprised at how authentic this restaurant was. The food was delicious and the service was excellent -- they type you can only get in a family-run restaurant. The waitress (daughter) was a sweetheart. Not expensive and well worth your dollars!"}
{"text":"Cute, quaint Japanese restaurant. They have quite a big menu for a small restaurant. We stopped in for a snack and tried the takoyaki, age nasu, spicy tuna roll and special scallop roll.  We both enjoyed the rolls. I would come back and try their dinner items."}
{"text":"Going to have to give this place another try. It wasn't bad but it wasn't all that great either.  By far their best dish that we had was the tofu steak though."}
{"text":"Date night last night, and we chose this quaint little Japanese restaurant, a quick walk from our house:). Although it was already 25 mins to closing we were enthusiastically seated with no qualms.   The server we had was so lovely. Friendly, engaging, humorous. She suggested a few customer favourites from the menu, like the octopus balls, and the beef carpaccio-type appetizer. Both outstanding.   We ordered A LOT of food, and every bite was tastier than the last. The only rolls I didn't love were the zebra rolls, but this is likely because I was already stuffed full and they had a thicker cream cheese on top.   Every ingredient was fresh and clean tasting, the outstanding and engaging service added to the warm experience.   The bill was $100, but we ordered 2 large beers (10.50 each), 7 rolls ( 4.50-10.50), and four warm appetizers (6-12$)   We had more than enough to eat and would definitely return.   Thanks Daruma for the excellent experience."}
{"text":"it used to be a ramen place then a sushi restaurant. i loved both of them but the problem was the air circulation system was really bad. that's why i didn't come try this \"new\" restaurant.   i'm glad i did finally visit Daruma on thursday. it's not busy and the air circulation system was fixed!   the service was good and i love the food!  the complimentary dish for that day was beans and tasted so good!  the sushi was fresh, i love the salmon and hamachi the most. and i ordered the special cold ramen, love it! especially the bamboo, soft and no root(fibre?!) left in mouth.   i always like clams in sake but not this one , i think it could be because the herbs they use i don't like or the sake?!   anyhow, i would love to go back and try different items from the menu :)"}
{"text":"The food was really good, though a bit expensive. I'll definitely go back and try some rolls, as this time, we both had hot food. It would be better if the menus were conglomerated into one, because it was a bit confusing what all was being offered."}
{"text":"This used to be Sushi Hibiki.  It's changed owners and chefs.  All the staff are Japanese and extremely polite for those interested in an authentic experience.  First off:  the fish is still excellent!.  I'd say it's still the best you can get in the city.  It's similar in quality to the sushi we had in Honolulu.  There's no such thing as \"white\" tuna.  It's all red tuna or better and of high quality.  All the fish we had melted in the mouth.  There were no blemishes and it was perfectly cut.  There were no \"monster nigiri\" pieces that require a mouth 6 inches wide to eat.  If you think \"more is more\" then this is not the place for you but if you enjoy high quality sushi meat you're in heaven.  We had a \"Large Assorted\" platter which consisted of an assortment including yellow tail, squid, octopus, tuna and salmon as well as a salmon roll.  Their salmon here is EXCELLENT.  It melts in your mouth and has the consistency and flavour of butter.  SO GOOD!  The rice was slightly dry which was unfortunate but the high quality fish (which I stress you can NOT find elsewhere in the city) made up for it.  We tried the Daruma Potatoes which consists of baby potatoes garnished with their house \"Daruma\" sauce.  It was not bad and only cost $5.  The BBQ squid ($8) was too salty for our tastes.  In the end this is the best place we know of in the city for sushi if you're looking for quality and not quantity.  If it weren't for the slightly dry rice and the over-salted bbq squid we'd give it 5/5 but it's still highly recommended.  Nigiri is $2.20 to $3.50 each.  Rolls are $4-6 with a few special rolls being $8."}
{"text":"My Fiancé and I were looking for a quick bite before heading out with friends. We read some reviews online about Daruma and just as everyone said, it was fantastic.   The food was delicious fresh, came out very quickly and i cannot get over how genuinely sweet our server was. She made everything so absolutely pleasant for us.   Definitely coming back here again!"}
