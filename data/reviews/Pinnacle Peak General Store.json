{"text":"Had breakfast there this morning. Service was quick, friendly, and courteous. Food came promptly and was prepared as requested - bacon burned, eggs over easy, etc. Tasted great, serving too large to finish, yet prices extremely reasonable, particularly for Scottsdale. If you don't mind waiting for a seat its a goto breakfast eatery."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and have been here twice already. Really great breakfast place, although I had a Caesar salad wrap the first time I was there. Cute, no frills place with great prices Can't wait until the weather is better so we can eat in the courtyard with the dog."}
{"text":"This is a good place for breakfast with decent food.  A neighbor recommended it to us as being good for out-of-town guests (there is lots of western decor and knick-knacks to look at) and a good breakfast place.  The breakfast is good - I almost always get pancakes - but the service is so-so.  My husband has had to send his steak back on more than one occasion to be cooked more and by the time it came back to us, I was finished with my meal.  There is often a wait as well if you hit the peak times (brunch time on weekends).  Parking can also be a challenge when it is especially busy.  Despite a few negatives we keep going back!"}
{"text":"This will be for me, uncharacteristically, a short review. There's not much to say about the Pinnacle Peak General Store. It is a solid place for breakfast/brunch. Nothing fancy, nothing awful, nothing great. For example, we had biscuits and gravy with eggs today; the gravy was the best part, full of sausage, but it was not seasoned really. The biscuits were a little on the heavy and dry side, but they tasted OK. Eggs are eggs, what can I say. They were cooked properly to the way we ordered them, which was a positive thing.  Service was fine---quick and fast and fairly friendly, no complaints from us.  We sat inside, which was somewhat noisy and pretty packed, but it was not uncomfortably loud. We gazed in wonder at the cheesy antiques and had pleasant conversation while waiting for our food. It was a 3 star experience all around, a solid  way to start the day."}
{"text":"Good food friendly service and a great location. Good place to bring out of town guests for breakfast. We will be regulars. We have lived here for twenty years I can't believe we have not been here before"}
{"text":"I had to meet a client on Saturday morning at 9 am (and was not happy about it), but I turned a negative into a positive by meeting  my friend here for breakfast at 9:30.  Such a cute little place with tons of stuff to look at, it definitely is not boring at the General Store!  They serve down home country favorites, the perfect breakfast foods if you ask me!  I had the Belgian waffles with scrambled eggs and bacon.  The waffle was good, but it could have been better if they let it cook a few more minutes to get it crispy on the outside, but the eggs were perfect and the bacon was amazing!  It was nice and crispy and the slices were thick, the best of both worlds!  I am not in this area often around breakfast, but if I do happen to find myself up this direction again, I would not hesitate to head over to the General Store!"}
{"text":"This place was ok for breakfast, but it has so much more potential than what it is.  The food was ok, just average, similar to what you would get at a diner.  I had corned beef with eggs over easy hash browns and toast.  My husband had the huevos rancheros, and said it was \"adequate\".  Waitstaff is very friendly and service is quick and efficient.  We ate outside in the lovely courtyard.  Something i have seen at several outside restaurants lately is birds that walk on your table and won't leave you alone.  This was the case here as well.  Getting back to the potential--the courtyard made me feel like I was in old Mexico but felt somewhat shabby.  Mature bougainvillea climbing the columns, much of it dead and an old broken wagon.  There were several fountains that added to the mood, but all in all this could be a beautiful spot for a restaurant with some clean up, landscaping, redecorating and an updated menu."}
{"text":"I took my family for breakfast here. The food was average. The general store has a lot of knickknacks to look at but generally speaking it was nothing special. The oatmeal we ordered had no taste. My waffle tasted like what  you'd  get at a motel breakfast bar. coffee tasted burnt and was your average drip coffee that comes out of a flask. Generally speaking it was nothing worth coming back to."}
{"text":"I love this place. Can't beat the atmosphere, whether you sit in or outside. Food has been consistent the 14 years I have been going. It's very standard American diner style breakfast. The pancakes are from mix not scratch, but they're not bad. The service is always terrific, really friendly and the staff never seem to change, which is a good sign. I love looking at the ceiling, and the patio is unique in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"A beautiful outside area to dine. A kind of clumped together inside store and dining area. I ordered the meat lovers omelet with hash-browns and toast, my mother ordered three over medium eggs which came out over easy. She also ordered potato's which came out ok and then wheat toast that came out burnt and then we sent it back but again it came out burnt so we sent it back a second time and finally came out ok."}
{"text":"Great breakfast - food and service.  Have eaten many times so want to share my applauds.  Outside is nice as well as inside.  Both have a great ambiance."}
{"text":"Great food and reasonable prices. Servers have been here for years and know most of the clientele by name. Been coming here for years and really enjoy the atmosphere."}
{"text":"How is it that I did not know about this place in the almost eight years I've lived here in Scottsdale? After we dropped our dogs off at 7 Dogs Grooming, we walked across the courtyard and saw how busy this place is . . . we just had to try it out!   First of all, let's just talk about its concept -- part breakfast and lunch restaurant, part general store/convenience store, part post office -- a true throwback to the western days of yore.   You can dine inside or out . . . inside is dark and homey . . . outside is the place to be in the often gorgeous Scottsdale weather. We opted for outside even though there was a little bit of a wait. I was totally surprised when they handed me a buzzer to let me know when our table was ready. (Oh how I wish every restaurant would do this!)  The hostess was so friendly and accommodating . . . made us feel like family right from the get-go!  The outside patio is uber dog friendly, and I am sure we will be bringing our fur-kids with us next time. The tables are also large and the seats comfortable (nothing too skimpy like some outdoor patios). And the courtyard is so lovely with fountains and plants.   Once we were seated, our waitress took our beverage order -- coffee came in a carafe (something else I wish every restaurant would do except fine dining!) -- and it was good and hot! We both ordered the three-egg omelets . . . hubby had the meat and I had the spinach. Both came with choice of home fries or hash browns and choice of toast (or tomatoes). The waitress recommended the hash browns over the home fries, so we took her advice.  Per my usual, I ordered my omelet done on the soft side. When our waitress brought it out, she exclaimed, \"that doesn't look like soft to me; let me take it back and have it done again. It'll just be a few minutes!\"  What a doll!  That is exceptional service! Most servers would set it down and not bother unless I said something. When she returned, just a few minutes later, I had the perfect omelet! I also asked for my hash browns well, and that's exactly what I got!  Hubby enjoyed his omelet, but thought there wasn't enough meat . . . I saw what it looked like and it was packed with plenty of meat!  I thought the portion sizes were just enough and the value excellent!  I love this place!  We'll be back again and again! (No more driving double miles to get to Chompie's for an omelet!)"}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast stop in all of Scottsdale hell the entire phoenix area.  Staff is amazing the place was really cool to be honest and the food hit the spot.  What a neat area with a ton of history.  Stop by to eat, shop, sight see, what ever.  Great place"}
{"text":"This is a great place to enjoy a hearty breakfast, with plenty of inside and outside seating.  I come here at least twice when I spend a week here in the springtime.  You can even stop by the post office inside!"}
{"text":"Great somewhat hidden place for breakfast.  Nothing fancy, but great fairly priced food.   Ate here 3 times during my Arizona vacation. Will definitely be back next year."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure to relax here over breakfast/brunch. Sitting on the outdoor patio is the best (once the weather is a bit cooler). Great variety of food and the staff is always pleasant. A great treat!!"}
{"text":"Very quaint and clean just stopped in to look around before my next appointment to kill a few min... but can tell it adds to the visitors of AZ a cultural snapshot...."}
{"text":"Breakfast on the weekend can be a nightmare if you go at the wrong time but if there is a line it certainly can be worth the wait."}
{"text":"Family-favorite, always a fun and eclectic visit. Traditional American and southwest fare for breakfast/brunch, and lunch. Large portions of food and drinks, fast and friendly service! Wide variety of southwest gifts, cards, and snacks -Â plus a post office and mini-mart inside as well! Nothing fancy or special, but an area staple and a tradition to visit."}
{"text":"Love the Pinnacle Peak General Store. Great food. Cute Post Office and love the Gift  Shop!! Lots of unusual items that are hard to find and fairly priced. The General Manager even did a custom order for me when I was looking for a special gift."}
{"text":"If you're in the area this is a must stop spot for breakfast or lunch. Located in an adorable courtyard you feel transported to another place. They have indoor tables mixed amongst an eclectic mix of decor and great patio which is where you should sit if it's not to hot. I enjoyed the eggs & french toast and my friend had the eggs & pancake. With coffee breakfast will run you $10. It's a great deal. Oh, and they serve hot syrup- so good."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite breakfast. It's an old place with plenty of nostalgia. From the 1950's trinkets hanging from the ceiling to the fun touristy gifts on the side of the restaurant this place has plenty of character. It's hard to pinpoint what makes the food so great but it's your standard country style breakfast. My favorite meal is the chicken friend steak, with biscuits and gravy. Needless to say come hungry. The staff is great and many have been there for many years. Give this place a shot and get a blast from the past."}
{"text":"Was told a 25 minute wait. 30 minutes later asked if we were close. 6 parties ahead of us. Left. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast, love the patio!!  Everything about this experience was fantastic!  We came for breakfast and the big debate is country potatoes or hash browns...no worries, they have both!! Very rare for a breakfast place!  Thrilled about this new find!"}
{"text":"It's kind of chaotic when you first walk in but overall pretty cool:) I had an omelet with hash browns and a pancake and the side and was satisfied! I would recommend trying it once at least"}
{"text":"This place is like the A-Team...If you have a problem (need a breakfast place to eat at not in a resort), if no one else can help (not too many choices in the northeast valley), and if you can find them (hint: they are in a gas station, behind the register and cooler doors), maybe you can hire the A-Team (or eat here)."}
{"text":"Does the trick if kids wake up super early and you have to feed them and rest of family not awake and you are desperate . Service fast. Not amazing"}
{"text":"We've been here two times now for breakfast and really enjoyed it. The food is good, and they give you plenty. I love the French Toast special. Really fills me up for the day! Price is reasonable and coffee is great. Will definitely back. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I had been here twice before and really enjoyed this spot. The last time I went was terrible, however. We watched as every other person was served before us. We sat for almost 45 minutes just waiting for our food and saw other tables who got there 30 minutes after us get served within 5 minutes of sitting down. We complained two times to the waitresses, who said they would be right back with our food and never came back. We eventually left because we were so hungry and felt bad since we were the only ones in the area who weren't being served. I would not recommend this establishment to anybody else since you apparently never know what kind of service you will get. I never wish the feeling of embarrassment and discrimination that I felt here on anybody else."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times all with ok results for a breakfast and lunch place. The last time was horrible and may very well be the last time. Our server must have thought she was the senior person social chair as she spent an enormous amount of time speaking to the elderly instead of waiting tables. Our breakfast was late which you'd expect that would mean at least hot....Nope. Two eggs cold, sausage burnt and French toast barely warm. Now this might of been because they were packed being a Sunday morning...Nope and received no explanation for the food being so late and coming out cold. Avoid this place until they get their act together."}
{"text":"always a good meal! never had anything bad and always sweet wait staff. casual atmosphere and nice patio seating if it's not too hot. this place isn't spectacular but it's always reliable for a good lunch or breakfast!"}
{"text":"We have lived close to this place for a while now, and thought we would give it a try sunday morning. There was a bit of a line, but no biggie. We waited about 15 minutes but that's to be expected in a small place that serves good food. There is lots of interesting stuff to look at while waiting as it's quite an eclectic little place. Our waitress was friendly, helpful and prompt. The food was well priced and big portions. It is a diner, and that is the type of food it is. Don't espect fancy breakfasts, just a hearty breakfast that tastes great! For sure will return."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! This large general store has a post office, convenience store, antiques, and a breakfast spot all in one! Service is always friendly at the restaurant and the food is delicious. I recommend the eggs Benedict and the pancakes! The atmosphere is very neat since there are antiques hanging from the ceiling and all around for decoration and for sale! Definitely a nice change in scenery and an inexpensive yummy breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Craving my usual veggie omelet and having just received a coupon in the mail, we went to Pinnacle Peak General Store for breakfast yesterday.  I've been here 10 or 15 times and this was the worst.  I ordered a veggie omelet for myself and my son had his usual Mickey pancake.  His breakfast arrived perfectly, as usual.  My omelet was AWFUL.  It wasn't cooked through AT ALL.  My eggs were cooked, but the spinach was still crunchy, the mushrooms raw, and the onions raw.  It was terrible.  My hash browns were raw.  RAW.  I'm not sure how that could've even gotten on a plate to serve to a guest.  My server was busy and she probably didn't look at the plate.  Because if she had, she'd have seen that the hash browns were visibly RAW.  I only took one star off because the service was still fine.  I told my server and she seemed apologetic (although she never actually expressed it).  It wasn't her fault, though, so I wasn't upset with her.  She brought me some pancakes instead and they were perfect.  We'll continue to go to the General Store, but I'm not ever going to order an omelet again."}
{"text":"Great little hometown feel. It's the hangout for north Scottsdale retirees. Has a Cracker Barrel vibe, but the food is not as delicious as Cracker Barrel. I had the fiesta omelette, which was good for an omelette, but I've had better omelettes at The Place and First Watch. The toast was overly toasted, and the coffee cups are like tea cups and the coffee wasn't that good. For what it's worth, the menu is super affordable and the decor is great for pictures. My husband enjoyed the French toast, so maybe go with the French toast if you stop in."}
{"text":"Friendly staff with great sense of humor.  We were seated quickly   Large breakfast servings  great place to go and grab a non fussy good plain breakfast"}
{"text":"Excellent Food, Excellent Sevice even with 11 people in our party. Lovely place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Breakfast for 4 people after arriving the night before. In a word, the food was excellent. The server was attentive, came by often to check and see if we needed anything.   All American style breakfast items can be found here. Everything from pancakes, chicken fried steaks, Belgian Waffles to Verggie Omelette. Even the beverages were top notch.  I would definitely return to this place. I would like to try their lunch & dinner menu as well. Very impressive."}
{"text":"This place has all the potential in the world to be super interesting but instead came off as a bit strange. We came here after reading all the rave reviews about breakfast. We sat down and waited a bit before any one approached and when they did it was not pleasant. Our server was barely interested in us and couldn't even bring herself to make eye contact with us. Our daughter who is quite the charmer couldn't even engage her. She was so disinterested that she brought us out the wrong drinks - not a good start. The food was completely and absolutely average. It was not worth the price or the rude service.   We will most likely not be back."}
{"text":"loved this place!! Nice people, good food, friendly service.  Wish it was warmer and we could enjoy the patio eating.  Will come back again soon!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast/brunch place in the area. You can sit inside and look at all the knickknacks, or sit outside if the weather is nice and enjoy the views in the courtyard.  We have been coming here for several years and portions sizes are large and moderately priced!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town for quick & easy! I love the hash brown potatoes and the Ruben on rye is really good for lunch. Never ben disappointed. Food is always served fast and fresh.  You can also take your dog there and sit outside. They will bring your dog water and you can order a meal menu item if your dog eats human food.  Hey, breakfast with your best friend, can't get much better than that!"}
{"text":"What a neat little find!  Venture into a world of vintage and old home cooking.  Fun to just look around at all the dÃ©cor!  Fun to take some time!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for over ten years, but our latest visit was our last. 11:45am, five adults, one kid, and a six month old. Even though it was busy, we were sat and placed our order right away. 30 mins goes by and we try to find our waitress. Another 15 minutes later we finally tracked down our waitress to see where our food was. She said \"we're working on it.\" Meanwhile, my kids are being so incredibly good but one was very hungry (we all were) and the other was trying to nap since it was taking so long. 5 minutes later the manager comes by and says they \"lost\" our order and would we still like them to put it in? Really? We said no thanks and left. I've worked in the restaurant business. That's not how you treat customers. They didn't seem sorry, more relieved because they needed the table. There was no apology, no offer to rush the order, no offer to comp anything. So disappointing."}
{"text":"Great everyday food for breakfast or lunch. Also really cool stuff to look at while eating, definitely a go to restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday for breakfast. Did a bit of research before we went (good reviews) and based on the name and website pictures it appeared that this place was going to be adjacent to a general store in a relatively secluded area. Upon arriving, we found this place to be in a strip mall (a bit disappointing), however the restaurant was quaint and had a nice outside courtyard patio. We got there about 945am and waited about 25 minutes for a table; it was quite busy. Between the two of us, we ordered an omelet (BYO) and eggs benedict. The omelet was cooked to perfection, as were the veggies and meats in the interior. I also got the country potatoes, which were unfortunately disgusting. They appeared to have been previously cooked and reheated, none of the pan cooked crunch; they were coated in a generic Mexican seasoning. My date had the eggs benedict and gave it stellar reviews and her hash browns were fabulous.  We also ordered coffee, which unfortunately was burned. The coffee is forgivable and I'd go here again but skip the potatoes."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for breakfast. The service and food are consistenly good. I usually order the blueberry pancakes which are very filling and delicious. The Denver Omlettes are great as well, although their hash browns are not the greatest, stick to the country potatoes. This place has your typical breakfast fare and is extremely crowded on the weekends.  This place is a hidden gem where you don't really hear anybody talk about. Definitely blows away the Denny's and IHOPs of the world."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow a real gem in Scottsdale AZ.  Great food great portion and great service.  My wife and I split a meal and it was just right for the both of us."}
{"text":"The atmosphere wins over your heart, but everything we've ever ordered has left us totally bummed.  I guess that's why the place isn't packed."}
{"text":"For some reason, this general store makes me feel like I'm about to go on a fun road trip, so it's a perfect place to visit if I want to pretend like I'm going on a trip. I think I feel this way because the general store reminds me of spots we would visit on California road trips during my childhood.   This is a gas station, gift shop, post office and delicious diner all in one! It's absolutely worth visiting and seeing for yourself. The general store is filled with knick knacks that include new items and antique items. I'm pretty sure everything in the store is for sale, even the fixtures on the walls! The post office is fast and efficient and a perfect one stop shop.   The element that stands out the most is the restaurant. The moment you walk in, a scent of syrup welcomes you and begs you to sit down and enjoy some pancake goodness. You can choose between sitting on the pretty patio or the funky inside diner. It was pretty crowded when we stopped by so we sat inside. I really like this diner because they offer meals which include a pancake, eggs and bacon/sausage or a waffle, eggs and bacon/sausage etc. So, if you are craving some breakfast bread to go with your eggs, you have the option to enjoy both! The food was above diner quality and hearty. It's a perfect place to have a casual yet fun breakfast on a weekend. The patio is also dog-friendly so bring Fido along!"}
{"text":"As good as diner food gets!  Great staff, great food and the value is much appreciated."}
{"text":"Not what you expect when you pull up to a gas station. Love coming here. Usually my opinions of restaurants are based 90% on the food, but this is not so much the case for this review. The atmosphere of the General Store is very Old Fashioned Arizona-y. Eating outside during the Fall and Spring seasons is a great idea. The flowers are beautiful out there. Eating inside is nice as well, very cute and quaint.  Never had any memorably terrible or great service experiences here. Usually good for the most part. The food is good too. Not like extremely amazing or anything, but it is yummy for sure.  This is a fun different place to go for breakfast or lunch. Would also be a good place to take people who are visiting out of state."}
{"text":"I happen to stumble onto this very nice surprise of delightfully warm hustling and bustling staff doing their all to accommodate and please. The breakfast burrito was superb, with a variety of guac, salsa, and sour cream. There is ample parking throughout the area, the setting inside is ample with metal table around the fountain for you enjoyment and many other options with the breakfast nooks tucked everyday. There was also a large dinning site inside with with multiple tables to feed several small families or a could really hig one. The decor of the build allows u to feel as if you have been transformed. I Highly recommend"}
{"text":"After hiking the Pinnacle Peak trail, my friends and I stopped in here on a Sunday for breakfast.  The weather was great and the patio was the place to be.  I had the corned beef hash with a couple eggs and hash browns.  The service was a little slow but the food tasted great when it finally arrived."}
{"text":"On our quest for another good breakfast place up North, we went to the Pinnacle Peak General Store early on Sunday morning.  Although I'd been a couple of times before, I needed this one more visit before writing my review...   and now I know - Pinnacle Peak General Store is all about consistency.  After eating at both the counter and at the table, I know you cannot go wrong.  Service is attentive and sincere.  Your water and coffee will stay filled, and your food will come quickly.  Don't expect the menu to blow you away; it's pretty straightforward stuff.  On Sunday, I had a spinach, mushroom, and cheese omelet with toast and fresh sliced tomatoes.  (I requested just egg whites and that was no problem).  It was much better than I would've made at home, but nothing too special either...   As Thomas said in his review, the gas station / convenience store / cafe / post office combined in one location give this place character... it's adorable and different than the breakfast places you've seen in strip malls and the chains like The Good Egg, Pancake House, etc.  When we were there on Sunday, they had a fire in the fireplace... it felt cozy and inviting.  I'll be back to the Pinnacle Peak General Store when I'm looking for a laid back meal and/or I have a few items to pick up.  We were full from breakfast on Sunday and feeling lazy so we picked up a few things (IE toilet paper) on our way out... no need to make another stop when you've got the General Store!  They've got it all!"}
{"text":"This place is fun. It's like a gas station meets a little cafe with great pizza by the slice decked out in old cowboy. There's stuff hanging from the ceiling, tons of decorations-borderline hoarder.... Barely enough room to walk around all the stuff this place has to offer oh and it's also a post office I guess. I guess we are just missing a drive thru marriage...... If your in the area or like pizza id say give this place a try. I've only been here 2 handfuls of time and I find something new everything. It's like a fun game of where's Waldo."}
{"text":"Came for brunch with a party of 5. The adults were served but they were dragging a kids chicken finger plate. By the time it arrived, all of our food was cold. I know that kitchen fingers don't take long. Our server was older than dirt and came with a RBF. Not the most pleasant lady to encounter on your vacation. I was not satisfied with her service or the food. Chorizo and eggs was bland. Upcharged for a substitute of 2 slices of bacon instead of turkey. The toast on the egg platter was burnt. The kitchen needs to get it together if they are any repeat customers."}
{"text":"Very nostalgic such a cute place lots to see and was excellent service was great and I enjoyed shopping afterwards. Will definitely go back when I return to Arizona. Highly recommend worth the trip just stop in for breakfast lunch"}
{"text":"We went on Easter. it was not crowded. it is a general store, Gas Station Post Office, restaurant and liquor store all in one. very friendly people very quick service tasty food. pancakes are very big. The pancake combo breakfast comes with one pancake which is more than enough but you do have the option to add a second pancake. It has a more homestyle friendly Cracker Barrel type restaurant feel to it."}
{"text":"Service is always great. Their cooks seem to have a problem with eggs to order.  A Lot of new competition in the area. I think I would up my game rather than piss off regulars."}
{"text":"Good little country restaurant. A Cracker Barrel before Cracker Barrel."}
{"text":"Best place to have breakfast or lunch on the patio if you have dogs!  Super dog friendly, they'll bring fido a water bowl and welcome you all!  Food is good and a nice place to relax with friends who have dogs.  Plenty of shade and beautiful atmosphere on the patio."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Excellent service. Friendly prices. Cute, unique setup. Love this place.  I always get the huevos rancheros if possible and am somehow always disappointed by the quality or unable to finish the food. The huevos rancheros here are to die for. I finished it all.  My boyfriend got the french toast combo and also cleaned his plate. I had a bite of his french toast ...so good.  We also got the chocolate milkshake and it was nice and rich and creamy. The waitress also gave us the extra leftover milkshake that she couldn't fit in the glass. Killed that too.  The waitress was really welcoming and down to earth. I noticed her colleagues were just the same with the other patrons: super friendly, taking pictures for them, etc.  We sat aside and the giant umbrellas provided a lot of shade, which made the experience super pleasant. There's a little water fountain and a church as a backdrop.  This is a definite favorite and must-return next time I'm in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Meh..... interesting atmosphere. The service was fine. Uninspired food. Kids enjoyed their breakfast. I ordered the breakfast burrito with sausage instead of ham. I received a meatless burrito that was on the small size. Country potato side was not warm with odd taste. Meh."}
{"text":"Reviewing their Post Office:  This is a very rude post office each and every time I'm there. I only go to this location, because it's closest to my home.   I only deal with this government mailing system, instead of Fed Ex etc. because certain entities send return labels through the United States Postal Service and there exist no other options (damaged cell phone return), or simply wanting to mail a certified IRS tax return.  The young, heavyset blonde is rude. She doesn't even thank me for my patronage, and she never smiles.  The elderly lady with glasses is the worst; condescending to people of color. She's borderline argumentative.  I think the whole world should know, and they shouldn't get away with it just because they are a government entity, that historically, doesn't have to give excellent customer service to get patronage."}
{"text":"Food was good. The chorizo egg scramble was very good. Service was good and coffee flowed. While you wait they have a neat gift shop and property to walk around. Lots to do and when it's not super hot outside hopefully you get lucky enough to sit out there. It's in a old post office. Would go back again!"}
{"text":"Breakfast is always good. The servers and wait staff are friendly and attentive.   The woman who always works as the cashier must be the owner's daughter. She is always unpleasant and rude. Your last experience is hostile. It is now a running joke on how bad an experience to pay will be. If I owned the restaurant she would be fired 2 years ago."}
{"text":"Never again! Rude people. I was in a great mood when I went in and now I'm a little agitated.  Thank you for doing that."}
{"text":"Best place in the area to have breakfast...been coming here for 10 years.  Great location (not in a \"strip mall\" as some other poster claimed) in a old Spanish building complex with iron chandeliers, cobblestone floors & arched doorways.  The outdoor patio has multiple pretty fountains & lush gardens all overlooked by a beautiful clocktower that chimes!  I feel like I'm in some charming old town in Mexico or Spain.    Inside, it's a \"general store\" with all sorts of tsotchkes hanging around....it's meant to look old & funky, people.  Food is diner food....just that...nothing exceptional, but tasty, plentiful & cheap.  But...the French Toast is AMAZING!  If you're a Foodie, eager to Instagram your most recent dining adventure to your followers, this is NOT the place for you.    Yes, waits can be long (its popular with both locals & tourists) but that's everywhere in Scottsdale (especially \"in season\"....Hello Snowbirds!).  Servers are overall pleasant.. occasionally abrupt, but they are typically running their butts off and let's face it, some customers can be difficult to deal with. Be nice (and patient).....they'll treat you the same.  Patio is dog-friendly, so take your furry friends!"}
{"text":"If you like to start your day with a great cup of coffee and a plentiful country breakfast, then this is the place to go.  I had the three egg meal with hashbrowns and smoked bacon.  Delicious!  Everything was cooked just the way I like it; hashbrowns a little crispy on the outside, and crispy bacon.  The staff was friendly and there are interesting decorations  on display.  Some are available  for purchase."}
{"text":"Such a fun place! I actually enjoyed that there was a gas station, a market (with homemade salsa and dips for sale, might I add) a post office and a cafe all rolled up in a cute little old-timey western package.  I came here with my family for mothers day without a reservation, there were 7 of us plus a dog so we requested a patio table and were seated within 5 minutes, Amazing. The service was spot on and so friendly. The food was tasty, I ordered a salad which was very good however after seeing the plates of breakfast coming from the kitchen I immediately regretted getting lunch, their breakfast looked fantastic.  This is exactly the type of place I would love to bring out of town guests to enjoy a leisurely breakfast outside or just just get out of the hustle and bustle of downtown and revel in the beautiful desert air."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place so many times but it wasn't until recently that we came here for breakfast. This cafe has a small town feel to it. Indoor seating is rustic. You walk in and all the tables are lined with red and white checked tablecloths. If the weather is nice you'll also have the option to sit in the outside courtyard too. The ambiance is casual but fun and it's a nice hidden gem for breakfast.   The menu mostly features home-style American cuisine. Food is good and prices are reasonable. My one egg scrambled with whole wheat toast was all of 3.99. You really can't beat the price and the serving was generous too. This place is open from 7am-2pm every day for breakfast or lunch. Service is prompt and friendly.   Just remember it's a General Store, Cafe, Post Office and Liquor Store all in one! So it's your ONE-STOP that offers so much more!"}
{"text":"We've decided that whenever our morning workout consists of a grueling hike (Well, \"grueling\" to me) in N. Scottsdale, we are refueling and then some at the General Store.  Generally (har har) speaking, I like to keep my breakfasts as heavy on the protein and light on the carbs as I can. All bets are off here. My order was a simple 2-egg breakfast with hash browns and sliced tomatoes instead of toast. The menu is simple and homey--there are no offers to make your order with egg whites only and no offer to sub fruit instead of potatoes. I'm sure you could ask, but you should probably just say screw it and dig in.  We also chose to split a short stake of 2 fluffy, malt-y cakes along with our respective meals.  I want to wrap myself up in one of their pancakes and fall asleep until it's time to eat again. We couldn't finish the stack of two, which shows how chewy and dense (in a delicious way) and big these bad boys are.  3 stars because service was a little off...just kind of scatter-brained and slow (and I'm VERY forgiving to breakfast service. It is one of the most god-foresaken shifts in the service industry). But not so bad that we'll never go again. It's cheap, tasty and hearty. Tap into your inner Midwesterner... and get the pancakes!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It has so much charm. The food is right up there with what your make at home. Real simple and down to earth. Like your mother or grandmother made it for you.  There are a lot of things to check out while you are seated and most are available for sale.  Will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"This is where I go when I am feeling like a country breakfast. Quaint little place inside a post office/convenience store. Tons of old 40's and 50's memoribilia all over the place (think route 66 signs and gas pumps) Great service, tasty drinks, and mmmmmmm that country gravy. When the weather is nice it is also beautiful in the courtyard outside for a lazy weekend breakfast. I will always love this place."}
{"text":"I love coming here for breakfast/brunch, especially since they serve it until 2pm. I used to go once a week when I lived in Scottsdale but now I make sure I go at least once whenever I visit. Steak and eggs can be hit or miss (the steak)...I usually get the french toast special, trust me, a half order is more than enough! its 4thick slices...,I get two eggs over medium with it and hashbrowns extra crispy to replace the meat. This is a lot of food for less than $10. Amazing."}
{"text":"A few years back we came here and the experience was so bad that we haven't been back.   On a whim, we decided to try them again.   Much more positive experience this time.  My wife had a chili size.   Perfectly prepared and came with a humungous side salad.  I had a burger, and once again it came as ordered.  My side was fried.  Again, they were cooked properly and were served hot, which is not always the case.   Although we don't live close by,  but when we're in the area we'll surely be back."}
{"text":"What a cool little place.  A little west of the intersection of Happy Valley road and Pima, you'll find the General Store- a mix of everything you need to start or end your day.  You can fill up your tank and grab the normal snacks inside, but they also have a post office and a little cafe with a full menu.  It's a great spot to grab a quick bite to eat or sit and have a leisurely meal.    Their coffee is pretty good and they have a much bigger selection of snacks, food, drinks and toiletries than you'll find at other gas stations."}
{"text":"I've been going to this general store for twenty years. With little out this far north for so many years, here is where you would get gas, a snack, a coke or something good to eat at the Cafe at Pinnacle Peak located inside the store. The antique-filled general store has the feel of a cabin in Rural America."}
{"text":"If it's a nice AZ morning/afternoon, head on over for some decent breakfast and kick back on the patio in this cute cobblestone courtyard and relax in the sun (or shade) by the fountain.  I've been coming to this place since I was a child.    WARNING!!!! Just don't sit inside!!! The atmosphere is pretty horrific! tchotchkes and red/white checkerboard tablecloths....I can hear the shower scene music from the movie psycho as we speak!  SCARRRRY!  They do have some interesting things inside, but I'd rather not look at it while I'm eating.  The scenery outside is much better.  It is very laid back and everyone is super nice.    The eggs benedict are yummy! Great place to grab a bite after your'e done hiking Pinnacle Peak!"}
{"text":"This is a fun stop for some history and a decent meal. You will probably see a variety of patrons -- locals with boots, spurs and hats; snowbirds looking for a decent priced meal and year rounders who live nearby and want a bit of solitude with their meal .. food is solid, service is good - can get busy and have a wait .... but there are lots of really cool things to look at in the general store!!"}
{"text":"I'm a little bit country. I'm a little bit rock n roll...thank you Donny and Marie. Pinnacle Peak General Store is all country baby. 100% U.S. grade countrilicous! Well, ok, it's in North Scottsdale so it's got a pretty yuppified clientele. Part gas station, convienence store, cafe and post office....this is the cutest place ever. Was kinda my morning hang when I lived at DCRanch. Cup o joe, and the #1 Breakfast with 1 pancake, 2 eggs and bacon. I'm tellin' ya...it's good. Hard to screw up bacon and eggs so I'll rave about my pcake...a bit crispy around the edges and full of buttermilk flavor. Syrup is heated just right and comes in a squeeze bottle the waitress pulls out of her apron pocket. Is that a squeeze bottle of syrup in your apron or are you just happy to see me? Coffee is sturdy and aromatic...like my lesbian cousin Rita. I haven't eaten off the lunch menu...to me it's all about breakfast. My friends have ordered and enjoyed canteloupe with cottage cheese and some kind of omelette which escapes me now, cuz, frankly, I'm not a big fan of the omelette. Childhood trauma and I can't go into it now. The funniest thing about this place are the copper pots and other bric a brac hanging from the rafters that are all for sale. Some of the pots are like $100! OMG....They also have a gas pump that's like $5,000...I guess that's where North Scottsdale meets the country general store. So hitch up the wagon and skeedaddle on up to the Pinnacle Peak General Store. Tell 'em Thomas sent ya"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place!  Whether you sit inside or outside, there is something special to experience.  The inside is full of antiques while the outside is a beautiful patio loaded with bougainvillea trees.  I especially love that the patio is dog friendly!  The food is always consistently excellent.  The service is awesome...there is little turnover in staff, so that says a lot!"}
{"text":"The post office is bad. Everytime I have been there something is broken. Either the postage equipment or like today the credit/debit card equipment (has been down for three days!!). The counter staff is rude & unfriendly. I have only gone there because it is close. But no more.  Go to another post office if you want good service & equipment that functions. Plus parking is horrible."}
{"text":"It doesn't look like anything fancy on the inside, but their breakfast food is to die for! The French toast is some of the best I've ever eaten. Will definitely be back again soon!!!"}
{"text":"I have had some good breakfasts here and not so good breakfasts. The interior is warm and cozy. The prices are fair. The wait staff all are great. The people cooking could really do a much better job and that's a management problem.  I saw under cooked eggs be sent back today. My potato's were cold. It's really hit or miss with the food. I'm in no hurry to go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This food isn't even good enough to deal with the horrible service it comes with.   Ordered food to go since the service here is god awful. I got there and took the receipt to pay first, since that's what they have you do before handing you your food. Then, I stood at the counter for about 15 minutes staring at the styrofoam box on the other side that I knew was my food. All of the waitresses looked right at me and kept walking by without even saying a word. This wasn't even a busy day. When one of them finally asked me what I was waiting for, she said my food wasn't ready yet and walked off in a hurry. I waited around a little longer and finally another waitress asked if I'd been helped. I pointed to the box and told her that's my food and I already paid. Got the food and left pissed, as usual."}
{"text":"First time here & we had an awesome breakfast. All in our party had great food & service. Food was very good with a large helpings. Very unique setting with the clock chiming every half hour. Beautiful fountains & foliage in the courtyard. Great atmosphere & fantastic food. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The real reason you come here is for ambiance. It's got a cool 1940's soda fountain, wooden plank floors, red checkered tablecloths, and a darling outside courtyard with burbling fountain.  Food is decent but nothing exciting. Expect burgers, sandwiches, chili, salads & a daily soup. All day breakfast is a bonus with gigantic thick pancakes. (I prefer smaller, thin pancakes but my daughter loved hers.)   Get a cherry, strawberry or chocolate phosphate for an old fashioned treat!"}
