{"text":"It's been a few months since I've had a gyro at this place, but I picked up some souvlaki plates and a chicken gyro last night. The inside has been updated with posters and the sign is different. Did it change owners? I don't know, but I've eaten a lot at this place for over 10 years and it has always been good - EXCEPT for last night. The chicken was so dry! Lots of chicken on the gyro as usual but very dry and almost flavourless. Oh no! :( I hope it was just a bad day for them but the souvlaki was also dry. And the girl at the cash was not friendly at all. Disappointed... I will try one more time, but if the gyro isn't back to standard I'll have to give up on this legendary gyro."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend. He ordered a gyro and I ordered a Greek salad. To start, this is a cash only place which I think is highly inconvenient to customers. Secondly, be aware that if you order a salad for eating in, it will be served on a tray, on a sheet of wax paper. No plate! How awful! I got the sense that the owners don't like to spend much on the basics.  If you want gyros, go across the street to Messini. Better reviews, nice looking place and most importantly...food is served on a plate."}
{"text":"It's getting the job done right. I'd been drinking canned beer and this place had meat on a pita with white cream sauce and Diet Coke. That's what I wanted and this place had it. Then I ate a second because why the fuck not."}
{"text":"I felt spontaneous and wanted to try a new spot. Meh"}
{"text":"I've eaten at this place many times and it always does me well. The service is no nonsense, place your order, get your food, and enjoy. The Gyros are tasty and the best I've had on the Danforth.  I can highly recco this place."}
{"text":"I had a takeout pork gyro and it was phenomenal. Sure I was hungry, and it was to go so I didn't have to sit at one of the small tables, but it was delicious, warm, and thinking about it still makes me smile.  Everything was fresh, the pork was richly flavourful and had just the right crisp to succulent ratio.   You can't beat this place for the food and that it's dirt cheap."}
{"text":"Do I come here when I'm on a date with a special lady? No. Do I come here when I'm looking for lunch/dinner on a weekday? No. Do I come here when I'm sober? No.  I ALWAYS come here after drinking a boat load of alcohol and need something in my stomach to assist in not feeling like a bag of crap-ass the next morning - this place hits the mark every time - no complaints.  NOTE: on Friday or Saturday night, if you see a drunk guy wandering around in the fountain outside this place, with a sandwich in their hand, mumbling jibberish, it's me."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It kinda depends on who makes your food though. My only problem with this place is it is kinda inconsistent. I ordered a burger here once and it was the best ive ever had. Next time... Not so great. Time after that.. Decent. etc.  I recommend coming here."}
{"text":"I have only ever had gyro sandwiches at this place so I can't comment on the rest of the menu. I go elsewhere for good burgers, fries or a bigger Greek meal.  But I always come here for my gyro fix. I get the pork as it usually has a nice little barque on the outside that gives it extra flavour.  Because they sell more gyros than anything else (or so it would seem) the pita, veggies and meat are fresh and tasty.  Also, they are not afraid to load on the meat making it a challenge to finish two in one sitting.  I recommend the pork over the chicken as it's more moist and full of flavour.  Worth a try when you want a quick, tasty gyro.  One last comment - the 4 stars is for the gyro, not the restaurant atmosphere. This is a pick up and go kinda place."}
{"text":"Came to Alexandros after seeing the line at Messini's being 20 deep and over 30 mins.  I have heard good things about the downtown location, but never had the chance to visit the OG spot.  The chicken gyro pita was delicious. SO soft and juicy. It was a lot more flavourful and tender than the ones at Messini's. I will definitely be returning here next time I'm in Greek Town!"}
{"text":"Best in the city. I've eaten at that other popular place on the Danforth and get the stomach pains after eating there. Always recommend this place for that quick fix"}
{"text":"Definitely would not go to this place again! Made the mistake of ordering a chicken gyro while my boyfriend ordered the pork- Eek! Gross oily meat, and I even found a bone sliver in my gyro! The pork did not look appetizing either, and according to my boyfriend was pretty dry with not nearly enough tzatziki. All in all, not a very pleasant experience. If you want an actual, authentic, DELICIOUS gyro, walk the extra 50 feet down the road to Messini- don't waste your time or appetite here!"}
{"text":"This place is nothing special. I've been going to Messini for a while and decided I wanted to try something new and saw Alexandros has gyros also.  I went in and the place didn't look appealing. Not to mention it was boiling hot inside. Regardless, I decided to order a chicken gyros anyways.  The chicken was alright, I didn't like tzatziki. The gyros here is quite a bit smaller smaller than Messini and is not nearly as good.  If you're considering going to this place, just stick to Messini."}
{"text":"This place has the best gyros in Toronto. I was introduced to gyros by this restaurant 3 or 4 years ago, and ever since then--it's been the gold standard. I even bought one from Alexandros, and one from Louis to compare and Alexandros one. Even though Louis puts fries in the gyros--the meat was dry.  Their fries with feta cheese is yummy too. I hike down on the TTC every couple of months for a tasty gyros and one to bring home. Yeah, the staff aren't going to be very social but hey--there's a patio outside and EVERYONE in the Danforth is friendly!   I hope this place is around forever."}
{"text":"Best gyro I have ever had outside of Greece. Homemade gyro meat, awesome service, great outdoor seating, overall an awesome little place. My boyfriend loved it so much he went back for seconds; I would have too if I had the room for it."}
{"text":"This is not a sit down place. It is best for a grab and go bite to eat. The pricing is cheap and the quality of the take out is amazing. You get a great bang for your buck here. It has a great location in the heart of greektown. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Delicious Gyro, with crispy chicken, nice sauce and fluffy pita. Don't go for the service, its kinda meh, but the gyro is really good!"}
{"text":"Late night chicken souvlaki on a bun doesnt get better than this."}
{"text":"WORST PLACE ON DANFORTH!    It's such a shame because ten plus years ago this place was the best!  I made a terrible mistake and decided to try it again even though the last time I went a few years ago it was god awful.  This time was worse.  Ordered chicken souvlaki on a bun, the guy pulled out a bun that was probably a week old, beyond stale. I could tell by the way it looked.  Then saw him place the most pathetic looking chicken on the grill I've ever witnessed. Four, yes four! tiny pieces of chicken.  When he finally placed the disaster in the bun it probably took up a third of the bun.  I took a bite out of it and the bread was sooooo stale and the chicken dried out and tasteless.  I threw it out after two bites.  This place just flat out sucks do not waste your time or money here.  Anyone saying the food here is good, honestly, must have been wasted out of their minds or grew up on kraft dinner because this food is terrible."}
{"text":"Nice small place with 4 tables and a couple tables outside during the warmer days.  Only two people working so it might take some time before they get to your order especially if a bunch of people come at the same time.  Menu is fairly straightforward: burgers, salad, gyro, and fries. They have a couple combos that consist of some combination of the above. Also, baklava available for dessert. Of interest is a dinner item called \"Gyro in a box (just meat)\" which I assume is literally just a box of meat.  Ordered a chicken gyro and a pork gyro. When the gyro arrived, my instinct to unwrap it to take a picture resulted in the gyro opening up flat and all the meat stuffed inside going everywhere. There's definitely a lot of meat judging from the picture...but it's also because the pita itself is pretty small (like 6-inches maybe?)  The chicken was tender and flavorful. Wasn't much of anything else; just expect a pita full of meat and you'll be happy. Compared to the pork, I preferred the chicken more because I found the pork lacking in flavor.  It's a good amount of meat, but I wish they had proportional amounts of filling on the sides like maybe more vegetables and a larger pita. At some point I had thought the ratio of meat to everything else was way too skewed towards the meat, which is generally not a bad thing because usually there's almost always not enough meat...eh, I guess it's difficult to find a perfect balance.  They accept credit."}
{"text":"Not my favorite Greek gyro place on Danforth but decent enough. Also, you can't beat the fact that they stay open till 4am on weekdays."}
{"text":"Great little spot for those late night munchies. But you will get actual good food as opposed to junk food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Yeah, the \"atmosphere\" is hilarious (usually a couple of grumpy Greek men, natch); it's old school, OK? Signage and all (it's in the same vein as Honest Ed's, and if you can't find a little place in your heart to love Ed's even a little, you're dead inside). The washroom (downstairs) is dubious, although I've certainly seen much, much worse. And the staff can be indifferent. And ... it's basically a cafeteria. Oh, and it's cash only.  BUT   The gyros are so damn good. Big, crispy, juicy chunks of pork, both lean and fatty. Nice, fluffy, lightly grilled pita bread. The fries are lovely; I just want my fries crispy and hot, frozen or not. Always get the Greek fries ... nice feta, drizzle of olive oil, rosemary.   No, it's not as cheap as Messini's, but we were not that impressed with Messini's. We loved the baked Greek chips, but the pork in our gyros was dry. The portions were comically enormous, but Alexandros packs more flavour into less. We're always bursting to full when leaving Alexandros.   The indoors bar seating is better than the tables, with a view out onto the main stretch, and it's also nice in the summer, when you can sit outside and ignore the screaming children.   We really don't go anywhere else, and even make the trip across town on occasion.   Hm. I guess I know what I'm having for dinner."}
{"text":"Great tasting, high quality Greek food on the Danforth without the attitude. Friendly cashier!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to eat when I'm in Greektown. I always have the pork gyro with everything on it. Definitely recommend you give this place a try the next time you're in that part of town."}
{"text":"Good gyros. Open late. Grumpy service - unless you speak Greek. A-OK."}
{"text":"Not recommended.  One stick of souvlaki for $3, and if you want tzaziki it's an extra $1.  Poor business management.  The guy is grumpy.  Wouldn't go back if it was the last greek food establishment in the world.  Yuck.  Plus it's just yucky - fine for late nights, and if you're totally hammered, otherwise - Forget about it!"}
{"text":"Alexandro's dishes out authentic gyros by the dozen. This small take out shop is tucked away on Logan Ave just off of Danforth. Open until 4am, satisfy your grease fix at just about any time. The chicken and pork gyros ($7) at Alexandro's have been Danforth staples for 20+ years.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"So... this is an interesting place.  On a quick trip to Toronto, the boy wanted Gyros - so we went in search of just that.  What better place than Greek Town, our old stomping ground?  Drove by the old house, and then scored perfect parking just off the Danforth.  Walked around a bit - and somehow spied the 'world famous gyro' signage at the backend of a Danforth building.  It looked divey - how can you go wrong?   (Certain foods just taste better when they come from dives - shwarma, souvlaki, gyros, fries, poutine to name a few.)  Walk in - it's a simple place - a few tables.  A counter.  Some greek guys.  It's our first time in - so we look at the minimalist menu (burgers.... gryos... greek salad - that's about it.)  Take some time making up our minds - the guy on cash looks just a little perturbed with us.  lol.  Adds to the atmosphere.  Get our 'plate' - which is a tray with waxed paper.  (Did I use the word minimalist already?)   The pork gyro meat is amazing!  Crispy but tender and flavourful.   Greek salad was pretty standard - not exciting, but hey, at least I'm getting some veggies in my diet.   Gyro sandwich got great reviews from the boy.  Pretty sure he would have eaten three more if we would have let him.  Greek fries were pretty standard (decent fries).  Bathorooms are in the dungeon.  Reasonably clean with low ceilings.  The stairs down could use a vacuuming.  :-)  Would I return:  Yes  - specifically for the pork gyro - either the plate or sandwhich. Would I recommend:  Despite my rating of 3 stars (A-OK), I would send people here for the pork gyro.  The pork gyro meat is a 5 star.  :-)"}
{"text":"i've been to Greece over 10 times and haven't ever been able to find a delicious Gyro in Canada like the authentic ones you find in Greece - Until you try Alexandros. The meat is plentiful and it has a nice char on the outside. The meat is juicy and flavorful. The pita is grilled perfectly, my only draw back is the tzatziki - it was a little watery and not thick. I'm guessing they use sour cream and not Greek yogurt.  I've always just endured Messini's and took it as being the best i'll find, but i'm glad I found this place. Cheap, delicious and authentically Greek"}
{"text":"Just not my favorite joint.  In Greektown you can do a LOT better for a gyro.  I'd say this is the worst I've had on the Danforth.  The location is awesome, though, and it's not too expensive.  It's just that one senses the business doesn't really believe in itself.  It's rather passionless in most every way."}
{"text":"Not fancy, but its nice and greasy chicken gyros will murder your hangovers.  Love this place."}
{"text":"VIBE  It's old. It's been around for a long time. I'm sure some of the staff has as well. The point is it's not fancy. If you want a fancier place, Messini may be a better bet. But the patio facing the fountain smack dab in the heart of the Danforth is a pretty good location, especially in the summer. I usually eat right at the fountain. I don't think I've had a particularly bad customer service experience here but I'm not fussy.   I EAT  I only get chicken gyros here. It's good. A solid good. A B to B+ on the report card. I think I've had the hamburger. If you're hungry it will do.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  Take out is the operative word here. Take it out. The atmosphere at the fountain or at nearby Withrow Park is so much more lovely in the summer. Not for a picky eater. Just sayin.."}
{"text":"Okay, here it goes..  Location is a sweet spot. Nice simple patio over looking at a fountain.  Really nice spot on danforth, the water fountain i mean.  So its cash only. 29.99 taxes in for the dinner for two which includes the following :  ~2 large pops ~1 large salad ~ 1 large greek fries ~2 gyros  Salad,  was super simple, too much oil for my taste. Picture uploaded.  Fries, were very fresh and very tasty, go there for the fries. Birds liked it too.  Chicken gyros... loss of stars here. Kinda small compared to alot of other places, chicken was super oily and almost fried amd hard on edges. Few pieces of tomato, onion, taziki sauce,more like yogurt, seasoning was okay,  So would i come back here for gyros? No. Fries ? Yes."}
{"text":"Food may not be presented in the best way but the gyros taste amazing"}
{"text":"I chose this place mainly because they had a small sunny patio in a plaza right next to a water fountain and stage area, a nice European feel!  Unfortunately, after eating there, I can't find much else to recommend about the place. Maybe stick to the take out gyros, which is clearly their specialty.  I went in and ordered a greek salad ($5.31) and a chicken souvlaki ($3.00). I was told it would be a 10 minute wait. No problem there, I was eager to sit outside on the patio in the sun.  10 mins later the server/counter boy yells \"HEY LADY! YOUR FOOD IS READY!\"   Really, counter boy? You can't BRING it out to me on the patio? Lazy f*ck! There was no one else in the shop or no orders to go out, yet you can't walk 10 feet to bring it to me? *grumble*  The food itself was disappointing. Never in my life have I been served food on a piece of WAX PAPER! Wtf? I was handed a plastic cafeteria tray, topped with a sheet of wax paper, with my food (salad and souvlaki) stacked directly onto the wax paper. No plate....not even a Styrofoam container. The salad was a decent size but the souvlaki was tiny, maybe 3 oz of meat.   Big rip off."}
{"text":"I came here on the Friday night of TOTD at about 12:30 am after the crowds had died. For only the first night of TOTD the staff seemed bagged already. But after reading some of the other reviews I see that the level of customer service here was on par even though it was TOTD.  Despite the crap service the gyros here are solid. The price was good and the wrap filled me up enough to absorb the alcohol I consumed following the gyro."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with the pork gyro, just wish it was as big as some other places in the area. I'm not a big eater yet I am a little hungry after a $7 gyro... wish they'd get a larger pita with more meat. Basic toppings are onion and tomato w tzatziki (spelling? lol) sauce."}
{"text":"Messini, it seems, has become the consensus pick for \"Best Gyros in Toronto\".  But they're not as good as Alexandros, which is less than half a block away.  I used to stay near the Danforth quite regularly, and Alexandros easily takes the gyros crown for me. Messini might have nicer pitas and tzatziki (and I could take or leave the fries in my gyro), but it's all about the meat, and Alexandros' pork gyros meat is likely among the most delicious substances in the city. It's succulent, amazingly flavourful, greasy (which is both good and bad), and crisped just right - it's perfect. Greasy, greasy perfection.   The chicken is also very good, but not as spectacular - it could be that Messini actually does make a better chicken gyro.  Oh, and did I mention it's open until FOUR AM? Late night food heroes right here.  Prices are still great, meaning an easy FIVE STARS."}
