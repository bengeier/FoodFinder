{"text":"This pizza is delicious! The staff is extremely nice, and the food is affordable. It's $5 for 2 slices and a soda, which is beyond worth it. If my metabolism could support it, I would eat a different kind every single day. They've definitely got a following, and I can see why. 5 stars all the way."}
{"text":"I've got to admit... I'm a huge Pizza fan and Rollin Pizza is some A-Class Pizza. I seen them one day on the side of the road on Stewart Street and I thought I'd give it a shot. I got two slices of pepperoni and a soda for just five bucks. What a bargain. They have a very organized system and one of the friendliest staffs I've come across. I think they even deliver. I'm definitely going to have them again."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Carson City, by far! You can't go wrong here. The crust is perfect. I could eat the Why Knots all day long."}
{"text":"FIRSTIES... I ran into this place while going into JUST BREW IT The smell was amazing but I had just eaten so I didn't get anything I left feeling like a huge POS Because there is always Room for pizza.  A few weeks later I found out that they were on highway 50 in BETWEEN AMPM and TACO BELL I called them ordered my pizza and the WHY KNOTS Because why not?  The pizza was done right on time about 15 minutes or so, not only is DESIREE hot AF But you can tell she was passionate and super enthusiastic about the pizza. I got home and oh my God the pizza is amazing And the why knots Are off the hook  Kind of shocking considering I was ordering food truck pizza Was totally blown away by the quality of the ingredients and the fast friendly service. Am I going to eat here again Yes. Does total eclipse of the heart play in my head while giving my order to DESIREE Also yes . Do yourself a favor support an amazing local business-and have some top notch pizza while you're at it GIGGITY"}

{"text":"I love this pizza!  I've been coming to Rollin Pizza Pies weekly since I read about them in Carson Now!  They're pizza is unique in Carson City and definitely one of the tastiest!   Why do I love Rollin' Pizza Pies?  Let me count the ways...  1) crispy pizza dough with fluffy crust  2) FRESH and often LOCAL ingredients  3) Owners are willing to make custom orders, add whatever, or even split their speciality pies in half so you can try more than one flavor!  4) creativity in pizza ingredient combos  5) hilarious and clever pizza names   6) great lunch special (2 slices and a soda for $5)  7) the why knot garlic knots...enough said  8) they post their location on Facebook everyday so I know where to go harass them!  9) you can order via phone, in person, or FACEBOOK- say what!?!?!  10) The owners are just lovely friendly people who don't judge me for my obsession with pizza!!!!   Don't believe me?  Go check out the purple truck for yourself, eat some pizza, make some friends, and feel the love."}
