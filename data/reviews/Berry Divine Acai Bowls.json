{"text":"Great acai bowls at a super affordable price! Being from the east coast , the acai bowls cost almost double and for half the bowl u get here! Definitely recommend! They are delicious!"}
{"text":"Found a new breakfast/sweet treat place! Knowledgeable and friendly staff, lots of variety for bowls and the option to get blended or a soft serve acai with organic juices."}
{"text":"Perfect light meal or post workout snack! Best Acai bowls I have ever had. Fresh ingredients are crucial and they definitely know that Berry Divine!  Great rewards incentives for returning customers like myself. Also they remind you about it.  Volcano Bowl is my new favorite with peanut butter and protein powder mixed into the blend."}
{"text":"This place was so great! So many tasty options to choose from, it's hard to choose! The staff is very friendly and helpful when it comes to picking out a flavor! So great to see this spot move into the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"great price to proportion. many options as well. had good customer service and enjoyed their playlist. would come back"}
{"text":"Large portions. Super fresh fruit toppings. Good customer service. Will definitely return for additional helpings."}
{"text":"Amazing bowls, but terrible service. Went in tonight and it took 20 minutes to make a bowl. Meanwhile, two people came in 5 minutes after me and received a bowl within minutes after ordering. Three young employees were working it and the place was empty. I will continue to come back because the bowls are really great. I give it 2 stars due to the service.   P.s. Their slogan \"reGREEN your body\" is super deceiving because there are no bowls with greens blended in, and they only have two items with greens in them."}
{"text":"Wow, Just wow. I work about a mile up from this place and constantly passed by and was extremely curious what it was about. An enthusiastic and bubbly woman came into my work and was sweet enough to bring us a stack of menus. Her energy as well as her passion about the product grew on us to the point a group of us decided to go try it out. Needless to say, I understand now why she was so radiant about this place. The store was clean, the people were helpful and I was able to eat something that satisfied every taste I had (and not feel guilty). I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"My new favorite spot for Acai bowls, sooo delicious! The location is convenient, right off the freeway and close by to where I live. Friendly customer service and staff! I highly recommend Berry Devine, excellent choices from the Blended, to Soft Serve and even in a waffle cone. They'll even give you a sample of their soft serve.   I had the Brazilian bowl, mmmm deliciousness in a bowl :)"}
{"text":"I had to call and complain not only about the looooong time we had to wait for 2 acai bowls and how HORRIBLE one bowl was made only to get hung up on. #shittyService #Shittybowls"}
{"text":"This place was divine! Had it for the first time with some amazing company and I definitely plan to come back sooner rather than later, everything was delicious, quickly made and the woman at the reigns was very informative, polite and even offered a taste test! Immaculate. Healthy and now I can properly pronounce Acai!  Learn something new everyday. I appreciated all this place had to offer."}
{"text":"The volcano bowl was amazing with soft serve. Perfect for a hot day! Definitely coming back soon."}
{"text":"Got luscious smoothie. Did not taste good. I love smoothies with just plain fruit but their fruit obviously isn't ripe at all because the smoothie was very sour. Previously had Vortex bowl which was awesome although banana topping was a very green banana and again not sweet. Definitely needed the sugary granola and honey to sweeten it up."}
{"text":"Love this place! Had to get an acai bowl two days in a row because they're so good! The soft serve is my favorite. Friendly staff too. Will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"First time going to this place.  The staff was very nice and helpful but my smoothie was a different story, I ordered a large and got the small told the girl that I ordered the large they gave me the correct size but it totally tasted and felt watered down. I didn't realize that until I was on the freeway driving home.  Will not be coming back"}
{"text":"FINALLY an Acai spot super close to home! It's been a long time awaiting and excited that Berry Divine is nearby. The staff were very welcoming and appreciative of our business as first timers here. We were offered the soft serve of Acai in which I've never had before, delicious and definitely a soft texture. Met the owner who was very nice and thankful for our visit. It's good to know he has a vision to help change people's eating habits by opening a healthy location. As my first bowl here I tried the Blended Brazilian bowl! Definitely will be back for more and highly recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"Truly the best acai bowls in the valley!! Chick full of flavor and great toppings that compliment the taste....nice alternative when your on the run in the AM!"}
{"text":"BRAZILIAN BOWL is wonderful!   It contains mango, strawberry and banana, which are fresh, sweet and delicious. They look so beautiful.  What made me surprised was that Berry Divine Acai Bowls Accepts Apple Pay and provide free WI-FI."}
{"text":"First time trying Acai bowls, we tried the Sedona bowl which was perfect. Easy to order, quickly served and tasty!!  Better than froyo and fresh!!! The shop is tiny with both indoor and outside seating. We're coming back!"}
{"text":"I have better things to do than sit around for 45 minutes without getting my order. Guess this 2016 hipster trend just isn't my cup of tea. Enjoy the overpriced $8 donation."}
{"text":"My sister and I come here all the time and we absolutely loved it from the first time we tried it. Best blended bowl we've had, and their very own soft serve version is also amazing for those with more of a sweet tooth! All the options on the menu are fantastic, and presented well. Our service is always great. If you are looking for a sweet, fresh taste with a fun environment this is the place! I recommend the Sedona Bowl or the Volcano Bowl!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I live right down the street from here we saw passed it the other day and I was so excited to read \"acai bowls.\" We stopped in tonight and all I have to say is BEST ACAI BOWL I EVER TASTED!!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this place to finally open and i was NOT disappointed. I ordered the summit bowl and it was amazing. This morning I tried the iron man smoothie. So yummy and filling. The staff is super friendly and helpful. My first time in they explained the whole menu and what acai is because I had never tried it before. They let me sample it as well. The prices are great and it's very clean inside. Love the decor. Anyways, this is my new spot, so happy I live right across the street from it! :)"}
{"text":"Really really good! Perfect breakfast on a hot summer day. The blended is perfect not to sweet!"}
{"text":"Tried a few Acai bowls at a few other places and no one could come close to berry divine. Was driving down Scottsdale Rd and saw a big sign reading Acai bowls. Figured it had to be good. I have come here everyday for the past 3 weeks and have tried every item on the menu. You can't go wrong with anything, but I recommend getting yours blended rather than the soft serve."}
{"text":"Lots of choices for acai bowls and smoothies.  The acai bowls are great!  They are pretty big and have lots of toppings.  Unfortunately, the smoothies that I have tried here lack in flavor and are a bit bland.  I would definitely recommend getting an acai bowl here!"}
{"text":"Was so excited to go!!  Went Sunday at 11- they were closed :(  Got my Groupon refunded.  Posted hours say they were open at 8 am -  Oh well ... This was the Glendale location."}
{"text":"First time and last time here I think... 30 minutes for a smoothie, I'll pass. At least 3 people came in and out while we were still waiting for 2 smoothies. One with protein, one without but saw him pour from the blender into both cups. So we don't even know if we are drinking protein or not. Smoothie is ok, but nothing to make me go back."}
{"text":"Hey Arizona, your state is fricken hot. I'm sure you guys know that though, and you don't need this California/Colorado lad telling you your state feels like it's literal fire. I'm sure that even though you're probably used to the heat, you still look for that escape once in awhile. Why not step into the heaven that is Berry Divine Acai Bowls and grab a nice and cool bowl of fruit?  I ended up getting a blended Red Rocks bowl. Which means that the acai is this kind of froyo-esque blend that the fruit and grains rest upon. It's super tasty. Like genuinely delicious and refreshing. After living in Colorado for a couple of years and getting accustomed to the snow, I was dying on my visit to Arizona. So these guys bowl kind of saved me from my internal overheating. And they did it deliciously and healthily.  They've got such a wide variety to choose from as well, so I'm sure you'll find something off their menu that suites your tastes. Super fun little store too. Loved the music that they were playing and their workers were all super nice and friendly. Not much more you can ask for than that! Definitely a fan here, and if I'm ever back in the area I'd definitely make it a point to stop here again."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Favorite choice - Red Rock bowl. Fresh fruit and Acai Berry blend is better than any other place I've been to in the valley.  Because it's all fresh it may take a while to get your order on a busy afternoon. Staff does their best to keep up with the crowd and they are super friendly."}
{"text":"This was my first time having Acai.  The staff was super friendly and helpful. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the music was good also. I got the Maui wowie Bowl and it was phenomenal.  Will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"You gotta try this place! Get one of the bowls and share- the portions are huge.  The only downside was they don't have coffee.  So good!"}
{"text":"Best Acai Bowls in town! You can't go wrong with the \"classic\" Sedona bowl. The vortex bowl is a great option too. Atmosphere is a plus."}
{"text":"Berry Divine is pretty good for quality Acai bowls but the downside is every time I go in I always have to wait 10 minutes or sometimes even over for my Acai bowl. Then after getting one scoop of the soft serve from the top I see a completely hallow inside. I paid for a bowl that is only being half given to me which I don't agree is acceptable. Debating if I should return or just make a drive out to nectar Acai bowls......."}
{"text":"Sara(h) and Racquel were extremely friendly and their service was extremely noteworthy and something I have not seen in a while behind any food service counter. They were so awesome, and made my experience so good that I'm motivated to go there more often and to tell my friends to go. Thanks again for the two vortex's, they were phenomenal!  -the guy that thought the store closed at 10"}
{"text":"The berry bowls here are really refreshing. We got samples of the bowls we wanted to try and the staff was really nice and helpful. They made suggestions for what they liked and we had a fun conversation while we were ordering food. I got the raspberry sauce bowl. It was soft serve consistency acai mix that was super light and it had granola mix and fruit toppings and a raspberry sauce drizzled over it. I usually like thicker bowls with frozen banana and protein powder mixed in but this is a good place for light refreshing bowls and you can get add ins like protein powder mixed in if you want. I heard about this place a while ago and wanted to try it. Glad I finally did and they the bowls were so good. I really liked that they had samples and that the staff really loved the bowls they were making and had tried most everything on the menu. They have indoor and outdoor seating and it's good on a hot day."}
{"text":"If you just want a sugared down acai, soft serve bowl with syrupy drizzle- this is your place. I should have left today when the employee told me they weakened their acai with beet juice, apple juice and pure cane sugar. So I blame myself for not walkIng out and going elsewhere. No brainer that the owners want more money in their pockets and do not care if they offer you a quality product. Was told their kiwi wasn't ripe so I substituted that for an over ripe banana! So sad. Pay attention employees to what you're serving, it's your job!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of acai bowls and was excited to try out Berry Divine. I've been there quite a few times now (they offer a punch card, grab one!) & each time is always as good as the last.  My favorite bowl so far has been the Sedona bowl with cashews instead of strawberries. Super tasty! They offer each bowl with either the soft serve or the blend. I haven't had the blend because after tasting the soft serve the first time I went in, I've been hooked on that!  I usually get the smaller sized bowl for lunch & find it to be pretty filling. I like the more simplistic option with only a couple of toppings but they have a few different varieties with multiple toppings. Overall, definitely a place I've returned to multiple times already & will continue! It's a bit pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good Acai Bowl this is the place! It is around $10 for the bowl, but it is huge! A lot bigger than most places with Acai Bowls, fills you up, and so fresh! Highly recommend coming here"}
{"text":"This place is on a level of ridiculouness that I just don't understand. I went here when they first opened and they took forever to make 2 bowls. I figured it was growing pains. No problem. So I came back 11 month later (I checked) and they are STILL god awful slow. This time around it took 22 minutes to make two smoothies.   Seriously?  I can go to the store, buy smoothie supplies, drive home, and make a smoothie faster than they can. I've been to places that can cook a gourmet steak faster than these guys can blend a smoothie.  What gives? I personally don't find their bowls or smoothies too different than anywhere else and no better, either.  Probably the last time I go here."}
{"text":"The soft serve was not good at all... tasted like beats. Unless you like that go for it. But the original was delicious ! Takes like bananas and berries. Why I'm giving it 3 stars. Is because it's WAY over priced! My SMALL bowl of the original blend was $9.50 before tax. So that is the main reason. Also it's nothing amazing I would rather go to Nekter and get a delicious massive bowl for less .  On the bright side the staff is amazing they are so kind and friendly and offered us samples."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Açaí Bowl companies in the valley.  The vortex bowl is amazing.  The staff is always friendly and helpful.  We look forward to our weekly visits!!!  A must try!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent acai bowls. The guy at the counter was super helpful... I think I ordered wrong though. Was more like froyo... prob should've gotten the blended one. The one I got was a little too icy and hurt my teeth. Will try it again though. Everyone was really nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Over priced. Not worth the money at all. I love smoothies and bowls, I know they're not cheap but come on. You're way better off spending your money at Nektar. I got the avalanche smoothie which was $9 for a large. It was runny like water. No smooth no E. How can you make fruit taste awful?? I would tell you to stay away from anything with acai BUT EVERYTHING HAS ACAI. If you have a LV tote with platinum hair blonde hair, however, this place for you. ;)"}
{"text":"First off let me say that I made a Yelp account specifically to review this Berry Define after my awesome experience. That being said, my wife and I come here regularly for their smoothies.  There are plenty of options to choose from and while I have only had their acai bowls a few times, they are always delicious.  I often make substitutions to my smoothy and they are always more than accommodating.  Tina, in particular, goes above and beyond every time and was so nice and patient in helping me figure what to order. Tina, you rock!! As for the wait times, I don't know what people expect, they make your order on the spot and because everything is fresh it can take a minute, but never unreasonably long.  There's a line because they make great food!  Thanks again Tina!"}
{"text":"This place is FIRE. A few of the other reviews mention slow service. I've never had a problem with that. Every time I've gone I've been waited on and served my bowl in just a few minutes. Maybe these people are going at noon idk? The bowls taste amazing. They have a variety of set menu options, but they are happy to customize your bowl just the way you like it.  My only suggestion would be to get almond butter and to add a little self-serve water station. A mini size would be nice too! Much love."}
{"text":"Whoa, Nellie this place is good. I'll admit that the concept of an açaí bowl initially sounded disgusting to me. Had it not been for my vegan daughter I would have never gone to Berry Divine. Not in a million years. But she insisted and off we went. Tried the Summit Bowl and holy moly was it good. Not at all what I thought it would be. Smooth, sweet (not bitter), tasty, and very filling. And I'll admit t, I went back by myself two days later because, well, I'm hooked on these things. I'm an açaí bowl convert and Berry Divine is now my new favorite place to go for a breakfast or lunch stop."}
{"text":"The bowls were hollow! Good taste, I got the Maui wowie, but not worth the cost for a snack."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!! My girlfriend and I tried berry Devine in Sedona and was so excited to hear there is a Tempe location closer to home. My favorite acai bowls ever. I like the soft serve the most and it's cheaper ."}
{"text":"Very good healthy 'snack'.  We were in between lunch and dinner but needed a healthy boost before a workout that wasn't an entire meal. I had the Maui wowie bowl which was a perfect blend of antioxidant açaí soft serve topped with nuts and superfood coconut and cacao nibs and pineapple chunks.. SOOOO TUMMY and refreshing!! This IS my new Fro-Yo!!"}
{"text":"Found a Groupon so decided to give this place a try. It is also close to where I work so I figure if it's good, I'll be back. The service was good, I asked a lot of questions and was directed towards the Maui Wowie bowl soft serve. It had coconut, mango, granola, cacao nibs and the wonderful acai mix. It had a salty sweet thing going on that I really enjoyed. The only thing I did not like is that there was a hole straight down the middle of the cup where the soft serve created an air space. Overall very good and I look forward to trying other flavor combinations."}
{"text":"Finally tried @berrydivineacai today!! The top one is the pitaya bowl topped with pineapples, kiwis, bananas, coconut flakes, and granola. The bottom one is the traditional Sedona Acai topped with strawberries, bananas, honey, and granola. Before ordering, I had a sample of their special soft serve Acai and I personally didn't like it so I got a pitaya bowl. The pitaya was pretty good, but I feel like there should've been more toppings (fruit) for the amount of pitaya that was in the bowl (same goes for the Acai). Overall, I'd come back"}
{"text":"I arrived at this @ 1:20 am absolutely no one in line and was told it would be a 30 minute wait,I feel this is poor customer service by any standard."}
{"text":"Love this place from the bowls to the service.  Maui Wowie is my favorite but everything I've ordered has been fabulous."}
{"text":"Awesome staff! They make a great acai bowl, my favorite is the Maui blended bowl. Love to eat there, will be back! I like the blended better than the soft serve."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!  My daughter took us there.  The large size was a full breakfast.  My grandson loved the Acai Soft Serve.  I wish they had one in Tucson........."}
{"text":"I just went to this place and it is officially my go to for acai bowls!!! I got the Sedona bowl ( the basic bowl) and am very impressed . I was in and out in less than five minutes for my to go bowl. High quality, clean space, and very friendly staff. I will be back, and I'll be back often."}
{"text":"My friends took me to Berry Divine after explaining to me how they offer the best damn Acai bowls ever. One bite in and I totally understood the hype!  ** I'd highly suggest getting your acai in the soft serve form!  Berry Divine has tons of different options, catering to both the salty and sweet lover's palette. Some bowls are topped with peanut butter and others have only fruit. I got to try a few spoonful of each of my friend's picks, and every single one was delicious. One ingrediant that I wasn't expecting was coconut oil drizzled on. The thin and hardened layer of oil gave the acai a wonderful crunch and infusion of coconut flavor.  All in all, you can't go wrong with any of the menu items that Berry Divine offers. Although these aren't really as healthy as one may think, they are a great healthy-ish treat and I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"A great place for top quality açaí bowls.  The ingredients and the quality seem to be top notch.  The large size was enough for my wife and I.  Prices are on the higher end."}
{"text":"Love this place! They have a really great açaí bowls! We come here a lot and we always get the volcano bowl (soft serve)! Love their soft serves a lot ! It's just so amazing and perfect for hot sunny day."}
{"text":"They say first impressions are important...that was evident the first time I visited. The employee that welcomed me was filled with energy talked about what an acai bowl is. This would've gotten a 5 star for service alone. I'd gotten the summit bowl, and it was delicious! Filled with a sort of acai berry smoothie base and topped with fresh strawberry, chocolate, oats, cashews and honey! This blend couldn't have gotten any better, sweeter, healthier or more filling(ordered a medium)! Definitley will be returning."}
{"text":"This place has good bowls but man the wait will take forever!!! I literally waited for almost 15 mins for a blended  Brazilian Acai bowl. The place wasn't even that busy. They really need to step up on the speed of things!"}
{"text":"Healthy and yummy way to start your day.  It was our first time here, and we ordered  Brazilian bowl and Pitaya bowl. I personally liked more the Brazilian one, but both were delicious. Next time we will try others."}
{"text":"I am so excited to have this awesome place close by! Yes the bowls (particularly blended ones) do take a bit longer but they are so good! The customer service rocks. I can't recommend the volcano bowl enough, the coconut oil mixes with the granola & it is almost like a cookie! So good! I find the pricing to be similar to other places. I do wish there was online ordering though so the waits weren't so long but that's just me being picky ;)"}
{"text":"I liked this place even better than Thrive.  Service was super friendly and helpful.  Tried the less expensive soft serve but decided to go with the original better.  Thought it was a better flavor.  I wish I lived closer to go more often!"}
{"text":"Expensive. Staff is slow to prepare food. They recognize their friends and make food out of order. There was 1 blender for the entire restaurant, this caused food to be prepared at a slow wait. Waited 15 minutes for soft serve food. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"I had the brazilian bowl and it was delicious. A refreshing, yummy way to start off my day! I definitely recommend this place if you love fruit!"}
{"text":"Never really cared for açaí bowls before coming to Berry Divine. The traditional take longer to make, they have a soft serve version if you're in a hurry. Tried most of their menu and no landmines yet. Definitely recommend calling in your order."}
{"text":"first time here today and i loveddddd it!!! so many fun options and tasted better than it looked (and it looked pretty good)"}
{"text":"I have to start the story from my excitement when I first taste the soft serve option and see how big the cup was. It was a pleasant surprise. The soft serve taste good and there was bunches of topping. I really like the twist of coconut oil on my bowl. I really do.  But you guys can't tell how disappointed I was when I found out my big giant  $10 acai bowl was HOLLOW inside lol. I was not happy i can tell you that. Hope you guys don't think I'm weird but I felt like I was cheated on hahaha Am I too difficult of a customer?! Or is it because I used Groupon? Lol. I guess I would buy if they have Groupon but I would not pay full price for a hollow ice cream.  I would give 1 star if not because the guy who helped me there was such a sweetie and since I use Groupon It didn't hurt so bad lol"}
{"text":"The staff was so helpful & knowledgeable about what was safe for me to eat with food allergies. The lady helped me with a custom Acai bowl. She patient with me as it was my first time."}
{"text":"I'm ADDICTED to this place. Always friendly and helpful service and easy in-and-out that makes it way too tempting to grab before/after/during work! This is the first time I've had soft-serve acai and I've turned a number of my friends onto it since."}
{"text":"This is the best Acai Bowl I've had hands down. I come here often and so does my brother. We've tried just about everything. Nothing is a bad choice. My favorite is the Sedona bowl. I love the environment and vibe of the whole place, the owner is awesome and everyone there is great! Fresh and fantastic flavor you won't find anywhere else!"}
{"text":"A place dedicated to Acai, what??  So I used to pronounce it Ah-KY with a hard K until I saw a Shark Tank episode where the guy was pronouncing it correctly as Ah-sigh-EE. I like it better with a hard K, but whatevs, I was happy to find Berry Divine. I was in search for my perfect acai bowl, but I did not find it here.  However, Berry Divine does offer a great acai soft serve.  I tried the regular Summit bowl for $8.25 + peanut butter for extra $0.75 and it was pretty good.  It's healthy food, but I felt naughty eating \"ice cream\" for breakfast.  The acai soft serve was topped with hemp seed granola, strawberry, chocolate, cashew and honey.  The soft serve seemed diluted and I prefer my acai puree and blended with other berries.  They have a small private lot where I was able to easily find parking.  Other great options for acai bowl in the area that I tried: Original ChopShop and Delicious Factory.  ....| \      _  , , , - - , ,  _  ,       .../  , ` . - ' ` '             . _   \ -  ;  ;  ;  , _     ..| ,  a  -   )   ) _         . ; .

{"text":"Delicious!! The Brazilian Bowl was amazing and a much better alternative to a pint of ice cream. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and it's always been good, but it seems to take awhile and my last time in was a little excessive.   I went in a little before 1pm and there was no one else in line or waiting for an order. I ordered a regular and was charged for, but also received a large.- which is kind of expensive. When I walked in, there was one person behind the counter plus the cashier. The guy behind the counter went in the back and I never saw him again. After I ordered, several others walked in and the cashier told customers how they had ran out of every fruit except blueberries. After 15 minutes, my order still wasn't up. About that time, a female employee came in and made my order.. not sure how long I would've been there if she hadn't come in. I still don't know what the people in the back were doing, but it seemed quite a few people were agitated by the wait."}
{"text":"Best açaí place by far, easily the best in Phoenix. A friend from Brazil recommended the place and I'm still thanking him."}
{"text":"I've had a few acai bowls in the past, but these far exceeded our expectations. They use high quality ingredients and have a large selections . It is a must try!!"}
{"text":"Tasty but definitely not worth the $12 For a regular bowl including tip... my blended acaii still had a ton of frozen fruit in it. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I came straight off the plane from LA to get my favorite acai bowl from Berry Divine. I ordered the regular size Summit bowl with soft serve acai. My mom ordered the Sedona bowl with traditional acai which is pictured. The cashews in my bowl fill me up and the chocolate shavings satisfy my sweet tooth. They are not light on the granola which is my favorite part!   The only thing is there service is a bit slow. The employees were chatting with customers instead of making our food. When you're really hungry this can be a bit annoying! Nevertheless I wish they would open one in LA!"}
{"text":"Yummy smoothies and Acai bowls!  My favorite is the berriful smoothie swap cashew milk instead of juice and the awaken bowl add bee pollen and blueberries!    This place is convenient but can be sometimes slow as just one person is usually working and it can get quite busy!"}
{"text":"If you have not tried Acai  you are really missing out it is a great tasting fruit drink and this place picked the right adjective when they said their bowls were divine."}
{"text":"Very expensive even for Acai. They have two sizes, and the granola is not vegan since it contains honey. I did not really find anything on the menu that truly appealed to me, I ended up getting the Sedona bowl sans granola and honey. It just wasn't very good. It was not very sweet and cost about $12. I have to say I wanted to like this place since I'd read so many great reviews, but you're much better off going to Genuine Fresche. I might come back and try another bowl, but it's hard to give this place a second chance unless they offer vegan granola."}
{"text":"The only thing wrong with Berry Divine is that they don't have more locations. I live in Ohio, but will always visit the store a couple times during my trips, whenever I travel to AZ. I LOVE Berry Divine Acai Bowls. I went in tonight and the staff was as friendly as ever. My friend and I got the Pitaya and Vortex, both traditional. I usually go for soft serve because it is delicious and quick, but we decided for traditional just to switch things up. Everything was perfect and these are some of the best acai bowls I have ever had. The employees were as friendly as ever, and Trevor took care of us tonight. He is super knowledgeable about the product and they always look so pretty. Almost too pretty to eat. Will definitely be going back as much as possible. Please get a store in Ohio!! Lol."}
{"text":"I had my first experience with a super delicious treat like this at Banzai Bowl in Huntington Beach last weekend.  My craving took me here.  The staff helped educate me, gave me a sample of the owner's special recipe soft version and helped me pick out the Vortex (nut free for my allergies).  It is was AMAZING!!!! I will be back next week!"}
{"text":"I've tried many and can say without hesitation that these acai bowls are the BEST in AZ! Granola throughout the bowl (not just on top) and delicious toppings. Very generous portions. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Before this location opened up we use to go to the Sedona location when ever we were doing day trips.  It was always delicious and couldn't wait for this location to open up because it is less then 1 mile away from me.  I always get the Brazilian bowl because I love the toppings on it but recently I have been getting pitaya base with Brazilian bowl toppings and it has been amazing!! You  must try this combination.  Although this place is really good it would really be that much better if they had fresh toppings instead of previously frozen fruits.  This last time we had stopped in the fruits were still pretty frozen and it was not too pleasant eating it that way for me.  I would totally go more often and rated it 5 stars if they had fresh fruit toppings.  I especially would love for them to crazy the mangoes fresh when possible."}
{"text":"Berry Divine is AMAZING! So many options for your acai bowls, fresh fruit, nuts, and even dark chocolate. They can definitely substitute a meal, super filling. Smoothies are decent too. You can ask for a punch card and get your 10th bowl free (which, if you're as obsessed as me, you'll use faster than you think!) The service here is incredible too. Super friendly staff that are always able to answer my questions and give recommendations. Price is normal for acai."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!! I'm always smiling when I leave. The best customer service and just a clean atmosphere. Really cool. You can order soft serve in a bowl or blended however you like it. The Red Rock is delicious and the sizes are proportional. The people there are accommodating if there's a fruit you're not too fond of. It's a great post workout as well...you can add protein!  Open late on the weekends. Definitely recommend. Shout out to the employees there! They are awesome!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Berry Divine in Sedona multiple times before this one opened in Tempe. They have a great variety of acai bowls and the menus are very similar if not the same in both locations. Most of my experiences here were good! My last visit here is the reason I deducted a star. The toppings on the bowl were delicious as always but the acai blend tasted bad...like the ice it was blended with was made with nasty water and that flavor overpowered everything else."}
{"text":"I love their acai bowls, and the concept in general. Negatives would be pretty overpriced if you don't want their soft serve, and there aren't really custom options so it costs an arm and a leg to add or subtract toppings. Delicious though. It takes awhile to get your order, but it's worth it. Wish the staff was friendlier, many of them seem like apathetic high school/ASU students, but still worth it for their acai because they have delicious blends and the toppings are fresh and endless."}
{"text":"Super Friendly Staff, Tasty Treats  I forgot the name of the girl who took care of us here, but she was super friendly and did a great job.   We got a Pitaya Bowl to share after lunch and it was nice and refreshing.   The soft serve is super good and refreshing too!   Clean atmosphere!   All in all a nice spot for a happy refreshing treat...."}
{"text":"First time we came here we had a problem with the rude staff. Upon speaking with the store manager and finding out that the staffing would be updated we went back.   It's a super delicious treat! Great flavors and fresh fruit!"}
{"text":"Quaint little spot with the trendy acai bowls and smoothies. They also offer pitaya bowls too. You can order a children's size, regular, or large with either soft serve acai or a special made one dependent on the type of bowl you choose. I got a children's Sedona bowl, soft serve style, Sedona regular size with mangos, and a red rock bowl. They were good enough altho my bowl had a large chunk of some frozen, icy mystery stuff that shouldn't have been there.  The regular size is definitely big enough to share for 2 people. Total cost was $30. While it was good, I probably won't return."}
{"text":"I love this place!! The Brazilian is my favorite!! The best part is the crunchy granola bits on top of the fruit. The drizzled honey is also yummy! I used to always go to this place when I lived in Scottsdale. Sad it's so far away in Tempe!"}
{"text":"Better than Thrive- and closer to campus! This acai place is a step above your average store. The owner Todd was very friendly along with his staff. They have a large variety of bowls as well as 8 different smoothies and a acai sorbet sort of option, if your looking for something a little sweeter. Overall, delicious food with a pleasant SoCal atmosphere; a must try for sure!"}
{"text":"My first time coming here (visiting from CA). I was pleasantly surprised. The cashier took time to explain everything to me and let me try a sample of the soft serve. I ordered a regular size that is huge. They have a lot of options to choose from so it took me a few minutes to decide and order. It's very good and I would choose this place again. Thx!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Whenever I forget/\"forget\" my breakfast or lunch, I'll come here. I always get the Vortex bowl - it's just too delicious to try something different. They don't skimp on the toppings and it's yummy every time! The staff have always been super friendly and outgoing. This last time I put in a to-go order and totally left my wallet at the office. I asked if they took checks, but they don't - I was in the middle of saying to go ahead and give it to someone else, because I don't have time to go back and get my wallet to come back. But the two staff members were super kind and said it was on the house! Definitely wasn't expecting that, but I greatly appreciated it because I was super hungry but didn't have the time to come back with money. Thanks again to whoever was working that day!"}
{"text":"I can eat here every day. They blends up some of the most delicious bowls I've ever come across. And huge portions too! Which means a helluva value.   Get the Volcano bowl or Red Rock bowl.. pretty much the only ones I get every time.  If you're looking for amazingly tasty food that's healthy at a great price, you got to check this place out."}
{"text":"Im loving the smoothies. Everyone that works there is very sweet and i have never had to wait long. Even if so its well worth it."}
{"text":"Bowls are mediocre. Better than Jamba Juice but nothing compared to kaleidoscope juice. The service is always slow. I'm giving 2 stars for the fact that I called in an order and was told 20 minutes to pick it up. I went in and actually waited more like 40 minutes with only 1 girl working. She apologized but said she was too busy to even make mine yet. There was 4 people ahead of me and she made there's first, so I waited another 20 minutes for a self serve acai bowl that only had 2 toppings. She didn't give me any type of discount even though she said sorry and proceeded to make me wait. I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"Yuuuum - they're famous for their soft serve & I highly recommend it. Their açaí bowls are the perfect balance of sweet with savory. Many other companies' are just straight sweet. They have a gluten free granola that doesn't have almonds in it - pretty sure it has some coconut flakes in it though so if you have a nut allergy still be careful."}
{"text":"What an awesome place!  I had never tried an acai bowl before but I've seen them all over Instagram, and I'm always down to try something that makes me appear to be somewhat #healthy.   I was impressed by how bright and clean it was inside.  Yay, I'm feeling cool and trendy already!  I was the only one in the shop when I went so I had plenty of time to talk one on one with the guy behind the counter.  I feel bad that I can't remember his name but he was awesome!  He game me some samples and went over the differences between the soft serve and frozen bowls.  I ended up going with the soft serve Brazilian Bowl.  Yum!!  Ok, so it wasn't a magical replacement for soft serve ice cream but it was still pretty good!  My only qualm is that the mango wasn't freshly cut, almost like it came from a can.  Also, I wish they had it come in a smaller size.  I got the regular and was only able to finish about half of it.  So if you are wanting to feel like a #healthy Instagram goddess, head over to Berry Divine!  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I just tried Berry Devine last week. It was AMAZING. The regular size is huge and well worth the value. They have a huge menu that you can tweak to match whatever you are craving. The one with peanut butter tastes like peanut butter and jelly in the best way. Everything is fresh and healthy! I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I love these acai bowls!  I've only lived here for a few weeks and I've already been to Berry Divine four times.  Nice staff, yummy bowls, and good options on the menu.  They have their own \"soft serve\" acai blend, which is good, but I prefer the blended versions because they don't taste as sweet to me.  My favorite is the Vortex.  I will definitely be a regular here!"}
{"text":"Have always gone to the one in Sedona and loved it. Tried this one out and quality and service just as fantastic. Love the soft serve acai bowls - will be back."}
{"text":"This place has such a variety! I love that you can get a blend or you can get soft serve in any of the bowls that you pick. I personally am not a fan of the softserve, just because you can taste the beets. But my husband loved it! The variety of bowls with different toppings and different mixtures for the base is awesome! I would also love that you can add things in to customize it. All the toppings are always so fresh! They also make the balls look exactly like the pictures which is really fun.   The girl that helped us at the front was very helpful and describing how it works when it was our first time there. She even let us sample the softserve. I have since been back several times because it's so good.  Tip: Add peanut butter to the mix it's amazing!"}
{"text":"Honestly, my favorite place to grab an Acai Bowl! i have tried others in the area and nothing compares.  The staff is friendly and helpful! I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a sweet treat."}
{"text":"This is the only açaí place I've found that tastes like real açaí. Most of the other places just water it down or add too much sugar. This place makes an incredible açaí bowl and I have been loosing body fat ever since I started eating one per day. Thank you for making healthy delicious food! I definitely recommend this place to anyone else."}
{"text":"This place is my absolute favorite. I come here around 4 times a week not kidding. If you love acai bowls or have never had them at all coke here asap. The staff is also amazing and always friendly."}
{"text":"30 minute wait for an okay acai bowl. Service was too slow. Pretty sure I can do it faster with no training."}
{"text":"Hawaii quality acai bowls! Love them.  A must stop any time we visit the area. We live in Wisconsin and would really love to have something similar nearby - I guess we aren't tropical enough :-)"}
{"text":"The bowls were awesome. They were slightly expensive however. The price was the only reason for taking a Star away."}
{"text":"Best Acai in AZ!! Wow Amazing!! Customer service was great! So helpful and accommodating! Excellent place!"}
{"text":"Did not like this place at all. I believe I got the Brazilian bowl, tasted like grass and plants. Expected to taste the acai blend not plants, made it pointless. Had to steal some of my bf's bowl. Do not recommend at all"}
{"text":"My go 2 place for acai bowls. Sometimes the wait is a little long but totally worth it. I suggest the soft serve acai over the ones they make. Brazilian bowl is where it's at. Fruit is fresh and taste amazing. All around great spot for breakfast, snack, or whenever."}
{"text":"My mother in law took us here. I like the idea bc I haven't had a acai bowl since I was in California which was like 3 years ago.   Walked inside & it's a cute small little shop. Almost looks like a frozen yogurt bc they had two machines behind the counter. The menu was really helpful bc they had pictures, which helped me figure out what had what.   Prices were not bad, $7+ depends what you get & I believe you can add other toppings for additional charge. So I ordered the BRAZILIAN Acai bowl for my son. That came with mango, kiwi, strawberry and granola.   So some fruits weren't ripped yet & some were. The acai part was a bit off. Tasted bitter to me. So I wasn't a big fan or didn't bother finishing it all. I mean, don't get me wrong... it's a big portion. Well package but it was alright that I wouldn't get it next time. Maybe later on, but not anytime soon.   P.s, customer service wasn't great. They didn't seem happy to be their. No smiles or nothing."}
{"text":"Most Acai Bowl places sell you the illusion of health. They advertise, fresh, wholesome, etc, but their ingredients are all-conventional and therefore loaded with toxic pesticides. Berry Divine started with the promise of being different - that is all-organic and that's why I instantly loved them when they appeared in Sedona a few years ago.  In fact, the promise of all-organic is still on their website : \"Our promise is to always provide the purest Açaí and freshest all-organic fruit.\"  When I ate there today, I noticed that their bowls are now all conventional by default. Only somewhere in a corner, and easy to miss, does it say that you can get 100% organic, at an unspecified surcharge. That's just wrong. What they're doing is trying to trick you into thinking you're buying organic, and accepting the high prices that go along with it, and then giving you conventional, which has only a fraction of the ingredient cost.  Another problem I have with that new philosophy is that organic is a matter of trust. You're paying a lot more money for it, and you can never know for certain that you're actually getting organic.  This is especially true in a restaurant. I trust restaurants that are all-organic, but I can't trust a place that tries to deceive me and sell me conventional as organic.  I'm really disappointed and I don't think I'll be eating at Berry Divine anymore."}
{"text":"Nice and clean spot. First time to try acai bowl. I ordered a volcano bowl, and it is really yummy. Their credit card machine was not working. So the guy let me have a free meal! Will definitely come back to try other bowls."}
{"text":"I decided after my first visit here about 1 year ago I would try it again. Terrible decision. The food is always delicious, but I shouldn't have to wait 20 minutes plus for a smoothie or bowl. This will deter me from visiting again unless I have unlimited time."}
{"text":"I AM AN ACAI BOWL FANATIC! by far one of my favorite acai bowl places! they are amazing and the people are so nice that work there, if you ever are looking for some good acai definitely go here !! They lost all the calorie information and all the ingredients on a board so you can see exactly what goes into it ! They have many locations and they are super easy to get to !"}
{"text":"not much to say other than this place is absolute fire! get there now. healthy options that are also healthy for your wallet ;) the service was quick and easy, and the employees treated me with great energy and attitudes. Love love love this place! thank you for this great experience!"}
{"text":"There is nothing I love more than acai bowls, and this place does not disappoint what so ever.  The soft serve acai is the best I've ever had.  It is incredibly sweet and smooth.  I highly recommend the Brazilian bowl.  Can't wait to go back, great Yelp find.  I'm about to drop some serious cash at this place!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now for breakfast and I will definitely keep coming back for more! It is so fresh and delicious and each bowl has so much flavor! The staff are super nice and helpful and it is a really cute place!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Smoothies are awesome. I'm there at least once a week. Highest marks."}
{"text":"Berry Divine is the only reason I still have a membership at LA Fitness.  A great way to start off your day.  It's a healthy snack/meal that I feel good about eating."}
{"text":"The place is very well lit and the workers were nice. I got the ironman smoothie, which was good. It was definitely a heavy smoothie, but that was the purpose because it lasted me from brunch till dinner time!"}
{"text":"I love this place...so much so I have been there 12 out of the last 14 days! I get the Volcano Bowl with pineapple and I can't get enough! When you go, be sure to get coconut oil - you will not be sorry!! The folks are friendly and the bowl is beautiful and tastes amazing!"}
{"text":"I have tried other places in town before I found Berry Divine Acai Bowls.The Acai Bowls are by  far the BES!  Everything is fresh and the Acai is so delicious. BTW- They do have Soft Serve & blended. My first time visiting Berry Divine on 83rd Ave and Union hills inside LA Fitness, a young man  took the time to help me decide what I wanted, He asked me all the right questions. I had the best experience!!!  Try the Volcano bowl its my Favorite. Or if your in the mood for a real treat try the Summit Bowl, with Strawberries,shaved Dark Chocolate hits the spot, You can even add peanut butter. I know sounds strange its delicious!.   Tip -I get the Large one and eat half / save the other half in my freezer. They freeze really well .I cant wait eat it next day for breakfast,"}
{"text":"If you like over priced health food, this place is for you. It's like frozen yogurt....but dairy free and only one flavor:acai. It ends up being a lot of sugar in those bowls."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed. After visiting their competition (Fresche) a number of times, I decided to give Berry D a chance today. I was ecstatic because many times I've had a craving for an acai bowl & Fresche is closed on Sundays. Stopped in around 12 & the place was busy. I took it as a good sign. Got a sample of the soft serve & ordered my Brazilian Bowl. My sister got her bowl within a few minutes. At least 3 people who ordered AFTER me got theirs & I still had nothing. 27 minutes later & I finally get my bowl. It's never taken Fresche that long to make my bowls -- and I always order at least 5 at a time. I don't expect to visit BD again ... unless I have a major craving that just won't wait until Monday, when Fresche opens."}
{"text":"The Sedona and the Mawi wawi acai bowls were amazing. Great customer service here and the bowls were refreshing and delicious! I highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Everything was great except the time it takes to get what you order. Took almost 15 min to put some soft serve in a cup and throw berries and granola on top. We watched her make it eventually in about 30 seconds. There were only a few people there!Other than that, helpful staff and fresh berries and very tasty Acai bowls.  I'll only stop in there if it's a lazy day and I don't mind waiting. Which is rare."}
{"text":"A great bowl. The size was reasonable for the price. Being from CA I am a lover of bowls. I liked the options and the fact they had calories and nutrition available. What I was most impressed with outside the bowl itself was that the guy who was making bowls came out to take my order when the counter Person was busy. That's a type of service I appreciate and give extra stars for as service is almost a lost art in some places.   I had the vortex (I think) and the ingredients were fresh and sweet but not cloying. Granola was ok. Coconut was excellent. Overall I was just bummed my stay want longer as I would come here frequently. I appreciated as well the bowl ingredients did not overwhelm the Acai. That has happened to me (like more = better which is not the case!  It is the complimentary flavors that make the bowl. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"My first time here and was expecting so much more. First they didn't have soft serve so I had to get blende, which was more money. You would think I would of been offered blended for a cheaper price since I wanted soft serve and their machine was broken. When I went to dig to the bottom of my cup I found a enormous strawberry that was not blended and was blocking my path to the yumminess."}
{"text":"I love acai bowls, these are the best I've had. High quality ingredients and great recipes. Maui Wowie is my favorite."}
{"text":"Love their Pitaya Bowl. Fresh, filling and super flavorful. The place is close to 202 off Scottsdale Rd which is very convenient!"}
{"text":"Tucked away inside of LA Fitness! Took me a second to figure out where it was but simple to locate in the end.  I usually go to the Tempe location but since I'm done with school at ASU, I can visit this one near home!  Still has the same great refreshing taste. Can get your blended bowls with no sugar added as an option for an added cost. I'm guessing it's slower here since there's a bell to get the attention of the employwes. But they're very friendly when I visited the past two times.  They also had Groupons so that's handy to use :)"}
{"text":"I'm addicted to this place :(  At least it's healthy for you!  Different options with a way to customize by adding in more toppings for your bowl. Also has smoothies and drinks :)  Can't go wrong here! I always have to customize my bowl someway since I have allergies but it's all okay. I'm able to get my topping substituted instead."}
{"text":"My only complaint I wish they were closer! I hope they will open another location in Scottsdale. I never tried the blended bowls only ever the regular and they are so amazing... filling and healthy. We drive 20 min just to have them. Price was I feel you get better quality and taste then the Nectar acai bowls. Here they are same price but almost double portion. I pay about the same when I take my kids to frozen yoghurt and again this place is far healthier and far better tasting. Love it!"}
{"text":"I've tried the Summit and Cleanse bowls and they were both so good I can't pick a favorite. Each bowl truly is a work of art!"}
{"text":"The acai bowl portions here are super generous and delicious! Awesome treat on a hot day... which is like everyday here in AZ. Definitely my favorite place for acai bowls in the Valley. They have 2 versions, soft serve or traditional. I got the traditional as I was told the soft serve version is a little sweeter."}
{"text":"The soft serve is the best! Everyone is always so niece and sweet. Worth the drive out to tempe from my place!"}
{"text":"Yes!!!!! What An experience... first time in and absolutely my favorite açaí bowl I've ever had. Love this concept and i will be frequenting this gem for my morning routine. Staff so friendly gave me a taste explained it all. I chose strawberry banana with beet added some protein what an addition to put in. So many awesome ingredients. Look forward to watching the Developement in this market."}
{"text":"Might want to reevaluate the employment of one of your staff as she was incredibly unwelcoming giving me a sh1t eating grin on her face. I say hello she says nothing, I say thank you, she gives another sh1t eating grin. Until she is gone, I will not be back."}
{"text":"Amazing acai bowls!!!! I love the fact that you have two options: soft serve vs blended. Soft serve is a little sweeter than the blended option. But they have tons of acai bowl topping options! A regular size is also more than enough. Customer service was great also!"}
{"text":"Waited over 30 minutes for a smoothie only had two girls working felt sorry for them and all the customers. Was told they didn't have enough people not sure who the manager was either. I love this place but horrible customer service"}
{"text":"So good! I've found a new obsession for acai bowls and this place hit the spot! Tons of different options and although I've never tried the soft serve type, it sounds like a great choice if you're looking for something light."}
{"text":"It's finally open!!!!! Found this place in Sedona a while back and have been back to it again and again. So happy to see one open and already killing it here in the valley! This acai bowls are amazing. Great pricing cuz trust me... A large is a meal. Staff is super friendly. I recommend the summit or the Brazilian Bowl!"}
{"text":"Major love for the Brazilian bowl.   That's what I ordered the first time I went in, and its so good I haven't wanted to try anything else. I always get my bowl blended, so it can take a while to be made if you're trying to run over during a 15 min break. To prevent that, I call ahead so it is ready when I get there. The first few times I was unaware of that option, until I finally asked the worker about if I could order online or something.   I would highly recommend this place if you are looking for an alternative to your typical breakfast."}
{"text":"Finally an acai spot that has a good variety, fresh fruit, and actually purple acai bowls (I'm looking at you Thrive/Genuine Fresche). We've been waiting for awhile for berry divine to open up as we live a block away. Delicious acai bowls and a soft serve option that's great as well. Owner is... charismatic. Rocking the purple acai suit today which notified me they were finally open for business!"}
{"text":"I think I'm addicted, I had never heard of this spot but now I go almost daily...far better than any of the other spots in town, hands down!"}
{"text":"I saw a sign on Scottsdale Road for ACAI BOWLS --- and being from Hawaii, I had to try this place! There have been a lot more places in Arizona that are starting to serve acai bowls, and I thought that this place was pretty good. I had the Sedona Bowl, which is a basic acai bowl with strawberries, bananas, granola, and honey. The regular size was more than enough, and I got it blended (but also tried the soft serve, both of which were good). Definitely not the best that I've ever had, but I will definitely be returning here whenever I need a fix!"}
{"text":"This place has the best quality Acai Bowls and ingredients of any place in the valley! I go to their Sedona location weekly and their Tempe location is no different. I have been to several other acai places in town and in other cities and haven't found a place that compares. They have high quality produce and granola, unique toppings, and they source quality, sustainable and ethical ingredients. Even their  bowls (containers) are compostable and their spoons are made from recycled and reneweable resources. They care about the Earth - not just making money. Their staff is always friendly and their bowls are consistently great. Berry Divine is a Must Try! Prepare to be Hooked! =D"}
{"text":"Have been to Berry Divine plenty of times and it never disappoints.  I know people have mentioned wait times but I've never experienced a wait longer than 5 minutes. The only exception to that was when they had run out of soft-serve one day but in that situation, what can you do?  Love the soft serve and can't get enough of it. My favorite is the volcano bowl and I usually sub kiwi for extra blueberries or strawberries without a problem. I love the added coconut oil because it reminds me of chocolate melting in your mouth. Try it out!  Also, don't forget to put in your phone number for FiveStars so you can earn points on your visits for a free bowl!"}
{"text":"I have been looking for a great place to get acai bowls since I moved here and Berry Divine has exceeded my expectations. I love that they give you the option of soft serve or blended bowls, and also have a variety of smoothies. Each bowl's toppings are exquisite and they are so artistically crafted. I tried the awaken bowl this time and I can't wait to go back and try each of the other options! Berry Divine is definitely one of my new favorite spots!"}
{"text":"This place has average acai, slow service and is overpriced. The lone reason I go here: convenient location."}
{"text":"The Best Acai Place Ever!!! It taste juste like in  Brazil  it's fantastic  Please make sure you choose solf serve its in my opinion its way better and taste more like the real traditional Acai! Hummm you will be addicted so make sure to grab a punch card :) youre welcome Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I went here yesterday because I had tried acai bowls from Jamba Juice and since this is on the way to my work, I thought \"Why not?\" I definitely was not disappointed. I walked in, not really expecting the fancy wording on the menu and the worker helped explain everything. I ended up getting a soft serve Sedona Bowl because I didn't want to be too adventurous on my first try. It was absolutely delicious! And what I love about this place is that the portions are very filling (and I am definitely a girl who can eat). It is also comforting to know that I can spend $7 on this instead of a meal from Jack In the Box or McDonald's. The ingredients are very fresh and I will be ordering here again for lunch!"}
{"text":"First time trying an acai bowl, I got the Brazilian Bowl based off of what other recommendations said, and I was not disappointed. It was amazing!! I'm excited to continue trying the other acai bowls in the future!"}
{"text":"You guys!  If you live on the west side, you need to go see Jacob at berry divine inside LA Fitness!  They make the BEST acaí bowls and they're open to the public; no gym membership needed.  Jacob couldn't have been friendlier...he was super knowledgeable and seriously took customer service to the next level.  This is the volcano bowl with bananas added, and that white layer is coconut oil that hardens like a ganache.  It was my first time trying it and it is sooo good.  Think I found my new \"bowl\" place."}
{"text":"I LOVE BERRY DIVINE!!!! The cleanse bowl is so bomb and the staff is so nice 10/10 recommend!!"}
{"text":"I came here for a quick smoothie after working out. I got a large smoothie with protein.  While it was good, I feel it was pricey at almost $10.  I prefer One Stop Nutrition which has more variety and bette prices."}
{"text":"Giving one star ONLY for the wait time. My boyfriend and I come here at least ones a week, and we've now learned to call ahead and order, and then we pick up our order 30 minutes later. However, sometimes I decide to just stop in, and I truly regret it every single time.   On average, it takes 20-35 minutes to get your order. They NEED to hire at least two more people, so one takes orders, the other does toppings and two in the back blending."}
{"text":"SO good and such big portions!! Got the basic bowl but added PB, and got it blended instead of as soft serve (soft serve tasted a bit too sweet).  Anyways, will be back! This was the perfect breakfast after hiking camelback!"}
{"text":"When I first started coming here, although I enjoyed the product, I couldn't stand the front counter employee. He was always just shy of being rude for no reason. However, I haven't seen Mr. Sour Pants in quite some time, and the employees are now all nice and friendly, and they greet you with smiling faces.   As for the product, I love their Acai bowls! I usually get the Brazilian soft seeve, but sometimes I feel a need for the Cleanse. Everything is always so fresh and filling. Whether you need a healthy breakfast, lunch, snack, or dessert, these Acai bowls are the perfect way to start or end your day.  Prices are fair and you get a lot packed into both the regular and large sizes.   They have a rewards program so be sure to get a punch card. (Although I wish it was digitalized.)   The only thing I don't like is that the spoons are not accessible to patrons. The employees hand them to you and sometimes they touch the \"mouth\" part or lay it on the dirty counter. Aside from that, I really love this place!"}
{"text":"My favorite acai bowl is here!!! I dream of having the vortex acai bowl every day. I wish this place had a downtown Phoenix location or at least open at 6am so that I can grab it on my way to work. Their acai is soft serve, creamy, and delicious and topped with fresh fruits and tasty toppings. The big plus is that you get a big portion for what you pay.  If you are in need of a quick and healthy breakfast or snack, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Was a huge fan of another Acai Berry Bowl place but now....I know you're not supposed to mention competitors' names when doing reviews but the other place rhymes with shushmektar. Anyway Berry Devine is a whole other level of f#*king awesome and WAY better than that place. The ingredients are just much higher quality and noticeably fresher."}
{"text":"I've tried acai bowls from all over and this trumps them all. This place is unique because it has an option to have the acai as soft serve, where its acai blended with organic juices. Highly recommend it! Presentation is beautiful and the bowls are delicious!"}
{"text":"I love that there's another place open that's dedicated to just acai bowls & smoothies they are my favorite thing & the bowls here are a really good portion size too."}
{"text":"After the total bomb the last time, the owner Todd reached out again, and was sincere and made sure that the other day was a one time occurrence.  It helped that my best friend also really urged me to give them another chance (she is obsessed with their bowls too)!  Stopped in this afternoon, finally got my comp. bowl I had accrued. It was perfect! The two guys, one I am sure is the owner's son, were great!  I even heard them explain the bowls to customers not familiar with them, so it was great to see this, and their patience.    Thank you so much for mending the other day, I sincerely appreciate it."}
{"text":"Always awesome, great taste great quality occasional medium wait time like any busy place that is making your food when you order it."}
{"text":"Best acai bowls in the area! The people who work here are super friendly as well.  I'm addicted!!!"}
{"text":"Oh heavens, you are amazing. Just back from Kauai and I am overjoyed to find you here in my own backyard. The available blend here is creatively blended to your liking and toppings were so flavorful. I cannot wait to come back and try another bowl."}
{"text":"Second time is a charm! Always delicious and my Wife and I have had 4 different bowls and all were excellent!"}
{"text":"The volcano bowl is awesome but sometimes the wait is ridiculous. I typically come in when I'm just needing a good fix of something healthy and filling. It seems like everyone that comes in is ordering to go, so most people are in a hurry, but my usual experience is that it takes 15 min or so to get the Acai bowl. Regardless, it's great quality and I go out of my way to get this Acai bowl instead of Chop Shop."}
{"text":"Enthusiastic worker who was happy to explain the menu in great depth. I'm sure he has to do that all day so I appreciated his patience and positive attitude. You can tell he was proud of the business.   When we arrived he came out from the back room and immediately washed his hands. I appreciate that! Cleanliness is a must and this place was pristine   I tried a delicious fruit bowl and it had great portions of fruit. The bowls aren't cheap but you do get a lot of fruit so it'd be easy to split w someone. Love the location so I'll be back for sure. Can't wait to try some other menu items too!"}
