{"text":"I'm from the Champaign area originally and was excited to have a new place to try when coming down to visit.  Uncle Jack's is a wonderful new addition to Champaign dining!  
We came for both dinner and brunch and found our food to be perfectly cooked both times.  I had the Steak Dianne for dinner which was cooked exactly to order (medium rare), juicy, tender and delicious.  For brunch, I ordered the pancakes and can say, without hesitation, these were some of the best pancakes I've ever had!  They were wonderfully cake-y and when combined with syrup had a flavor I would almost compare to a delicious glased doughnut.  I don't know what they put in their batter, but they were amazing.  My boyfriend and I each had a bloodymary with our brunch and were pleased to find they use ZingZang mix (highly recommend picking some up if you've never had it) which made them delightfully tangy.

The only faults I found there (wait times for brunch and slightly slow service) are typical for a new restaurant and I expect will be worked out the longer they're open.  The food was worth the wait and I definitely plan to go back the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Delicious.  Really good coffee.  I got the Mexican Skillet and it was awesome.  Service was decent, but not all that fast."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  

Went here on a Sunday after spring break, with my girlfriend's family.  I did get the whole carafe of coffee, which was nice, but service was otherwise not very good.  The waitress was really disinterested - did not know the beer or the specials of the day.  

Food seemed to vary.  I got the country eggs benedict plate which was actually reasonably good.  The eggs were decently poached, the gravy was tasty, and the sausage was a little spicy and flavorful.  There were little fried potato squares - not quite as many as I might have expected, but I was full by the time I finished everything.  My girlfriend's salmon eggs benedict was also pretty good.  

My girlfriend's sister got a club sandwich and gave us the leftovers.  It is undoubtedly one of the worst sandwiches I've had - it's drowning in mayonnaise and the outside seems to have been briefly fried in cheap vegetable oil.  Not appetizing.  Based on my food I probably would have given three stars, but I am taking one off because a club sandwich should not be this bad, and a club sandwich shouldn't be hard to make.  

So in summary: really disinterested service, moderate to high prices, and be careful what you order.  Some meals are good, others are really not.

I would instead recommend the Apple Dumpling or Courier Cafe for breakfast for cheaper.  Or in the same price range but more interesting, Das Cafe.  

Even for a chain I would probably hit Cracker Barrel first, they have interesting things in the store."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for breakfast, and it was NOT good. The \"blueberry topping\" on my crepes was a gel-like consistency, the turkey sausage patties were dried-out hockey pucks, and I think there were canned vegetables in my wife's skillet. I would rather go to IHOP, the food there would be better and it would cost about 60% of this place. If you want a high quality breakfast, go to the Original Pancake House."}
{"text":"I went to Uncle Jack's for dinner and I have to say I was not disappointed! The atmosphere is friendly and nicely thought out, if slightly nondescript. Carafe's of water with lemon await you as you sit at your table. It's a simple touch, but it's a nice one. The wait staff was fast and efficient.

But the best part was definitely the food. I got an Uncle Jack's Burger. A spicy, creamy sauce, a green chile sauce and crunchy tortilla shreds sit on top of a well-portioned, juicy burger. The flavors complimented each other very well. Pickles, onions, fresh tomatoes and some leafy green lettuce are on the side to build your burger the way you want. Despite all of this the burger stayed together very well. It was slightly messy--but in a good way--and half the toppings did not end up on the plate.

I got the macaroni and cheese for a side dish, and it had a ton of cheese flavor and a pleasingly thick, creamy sauce. The portion size was nice, although definitely more of a lunch portion than a dinner portion. I definitely plan to go back to this new CU restaurant to try out their breakfast and dinner items."}
{"text":"I've been to this place four or five times now and have always enjoyed the food and service. On weekends, the service can slow down some but that's because it's packed! Generally speaking, the wait staff is really friendly and even when rushed, they do their best to check on you.

The coffee is outstanding for several reasons: the rich flavor, the fact that they leave a stainless steel carafe of it at your table, and if you order cream with it, it comes with REAL cream. 

They have good daily specials, as well. They stopped serving for dinner, which is a disappointment, but their breakfast and brunch is really fabulous. We love Uncle Jack's!"}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed a late lunch at Uncle Jack's. I had the meatloaf dinner, which was firm, and seasoned with southwestern spices. The vegetables that came with it were firm, not overcooked. The mac & cheese that came with it was good, thick and cheesy, but not my preferred style.

My wife had a biscuit with sausage, poached egg, and sausage gravy. The sausage gravy had big chunks of sausage. The sausage (both patty and in gravy) had good flavor. The biscuit was a bit disappointing, not really flaky. Her potatoes were really nicely fried, crispy outsides and tender insides.

Regular coffee was good, but could have been a bit hotter. Service was good, friendly and responsive.

{"text":"Delicious!!  Lots to choose from, both savory and sweet.  I had the rockafeller omlette with salmon, It was A-mazing!  They had chocolate covered cherry pancakes as a special and espresso milkshakes, I'm heading back ASAP"}
{"text":"Ate for breakfast, had carafe and water at the table. Food was really good. Bathrooms were clean.  Atmosphere was really nice. 

Cons
Turkey sausage could have been a bit bigger for $2 (it's 1/4 size of First Watch sausage). 
Beware: kids drinks are separate- over $2 for a chocolate milk. Never have paid that much. 
Staff had no personality, as in other reviews. 

If it wasn't for the cons I would have given it a 5 star easy."}
