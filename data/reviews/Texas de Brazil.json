{"text":"I'm torn on how to review this restaurant. Given the lack of choices in da Burgh for Brazilian steakhouses, I might rate it 3 stars. Compared to other Texas de Brazil locations I have tried, this restaurant rates 1 star. Over all, I decided to average it out at 2. It isn't at all bad, but it should be much better.  Other reviews have covered the experience so I'll stick to what didn't work, and then mention the things that did.  The salad bar is nice, but not half the size of what is normally offered at a Texas de Brazil. I will sometimes opt for just the salad bar, but this one doesn't have the selection. Usually I would tell vegetarians they could eat here and be happy, I'm not sure I would recommend this location.  Meat is the star of the show. It was sadly lacking here. The meat we got was good, but they had maybe half as many gauchos as normal. The experience is supposed to be like a meat parade - the meat comes in so many cuts and options, and so fast, that you can't keep up, and very quickly have to flip your card over to say you've had enough, at least for now. Here that never happened. The meats came around so infrequently we nearly always sat with an empty plate before the next gaucho came around.   Of the advertised cuts of meat, we saw just about half in the time we were there. Usually picanha is rotated through frequently, but here it came by only twice. Flank and leg of lamb came by once. We were offered filet, chicken, and sausage many times.  Also, at the beginning they ask if there is any specific cut you like, and we said beef ribs, which is our favorite. When we were ready to leave, they still had not come out so we asked again. They did come out, but the meat was dried out and not very appetizing.   High points were my caipirinha, the lobster bisque, and I'll give them bonus points for the fact three different people asked us if we liked our table or if we would like to move.   The experience was summed up by my boyfriend asking at the end of the meal if I could take him someplace else for his birthday, since this wasn't quite what he was hoping for."}
{"text":"Simply delicious. I took my wife out on a date in vegas for the last couple of hours we were in town. We chose Texas de  Brazil because we like steakhouses. Everywhere we go, we usually get a steakhouse in there somewhere. Our experience in Texas de Brazil was phenomenal. The salad bar was really good.. but trust me, you go for the meat. My wife kept eating the beans (Feijoada) and she normally doesn't eat beans at all. The service was also really nice.. we had our luggage with us and they kept it aside while we were in the restaurant. Overall great experience. Not overpriced either."}
{"text":"VERDICT:  A dizzying array of grilled meats and a very well stocked salad bar (available by itself, too) make this a worthy destination for carnivores and  non-carnivores alike.  SERVICE:  I've had mixed results here, ranging from good to sub-par. It seems to depend on the server, their level of knowledge, and how busy it is. On the whole, it's on the slow side, with longer than necessary waits for non-buffet items (drinks, sides, desserts). The manager did recognize me on my repeat visits though, and made it a point to come over and welcome me back, which I appreciated.  FOOD:  For those unfamiliar with the Rodizio/Churrascaria concept, diners pay a fixed price (comparable to what you'd pay for a steak entree at an upscale steakhouse) for an all-you-can-eat array of seasoned grilled meats. The meats are brought out from the kitchen on skewers and portions are carved off directly at your table and onto your plate. You can indicate whether you want the servers to come around again by flipping an indicator at your table from red to green.  TdB is worth the price of admission for the lamb alone. Lamb still isn't on the menu at too many restaurants, and over here, it's prepared beautifully, both as chops and as leg of lamb. Try it with the mint jelly from the salad bar and you won't be disappointed. If lamb isn't your thing, fear not - you could always get the chicken parm, flank steak, sausage, ribs, sirloin, or a variety of meats wrapped in bacon, including a bacon wrapped filet. And then there are those delicious warm biscuits.  If it all seems a little overwhelming, I'd skip the ribs and the filet mignon. There are  restaurants and steakhouses a plenty that serve these items, and frankly, do a better job of it. The parmesan crusted chicken isn't particularly noteworthy either. To get the biggest gastronomical bang for my buck, I'd concentrate on the lamb, the flank steak (goes great with the potatoes), the sausage, and the Picanha, which is the house specialty. Picanha is a steak cut popular in Brazil, similar to Top Sirloin, which is how it is sometimes referred to here. At TdB, they have it available seasoned with garlic and without. Despite my love of garlic, I preferred the non-garlic version for its subtler flavors.  Every dinner also includes the salad bar, which puts anything at other chain establishments to shame. In addition to salad of course, there are soups, sushi, cured meats, cheeses, and fruit. In fact, it's tempting to fill up on the salad bar alone. Fortunately for those of us who want to do just that, or are vegetarian/pescatarian, the salad bar is also available by itself for a lower price.   AMBIANCE: TdB's location in Station Square gives it a festive vibe, especially on the two or three days a year when Pittsburgh has nice weather. The decor of the restaurant itself is a bit garish and the lighting could stand to be a not quite so bright, but aside from that, still reasonably upscale - think birthday dinner, not anniversary.  BOTTOM LINE:  What's not to like about unlimited beef, chicken, pork and lamb? Until and unless a Fogo de Chao opens in Pittsburgh, this remains a better bet than the past-its-prime Green Forest churrascaria in Penn Hills."}
{"text":"I don't generally like chains. But this is certainly an exception. There is something for everyone. My husband is a huge meat eater, and I lean more towards the greens (and carbs! LOL). We both have plenty of amazing options. I love the lobster bisque. And believe it or not, they have incredible black beans and scalloped potatoes. Staff is always ON IT and we've had many great meals here."}
{"text":"I am not much of a buffet person. I find them super gross. However, this was much different than i imagined. There was such a variety of appetizers, salads and side dishes to complement the meats. Asparagus and lobster bisque were delish. Amazing! Great service, fresh and creatively prepared food. A fantastic meal."}
{"text":"Great food. Excellent food.  The service, though very nice was INCREDIBLY...EPICALLY slow. Felt like we were getting hungry again waiting for the check."}
{"text":"If you like meats ,then this is the place to go all the meats were well seasoned and cooked fresh they also have huge salad bar with alot of veggies and fresh dressings,service was prompt and attentive as well, nice classy casual environment, will be back"}
{"text":"The salad bar is excellent. The service was excellent. The waitress was awesome I think her name was Paula...Probably one of the best waitresses Ive ever seen .She was really nice and checked on us frequently. Every time we got up from our table she would come out of nowhere and fold our napkin and put it back on our table. She was quick on the drinks and empty plates were promptly removed. The meat was quick to come to the table and frequent .All the food was excellent.             I guess im not as good an eater as I used to be. I don't think I can eat 65.00 worth of food any more. Though the food and service were great I probably wouldn't return only because Im 53 and need to keep a closer eye on my cholesterol intake ( not their fault )."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for 6:00 expecting it to be busy on Saturday,  arrived at 5:30 and was seated promptly. The salad bar area is very nice,  dinner was going very well  until one of the gentleman slicing flank steak decided we needed an English lesson on the difference of can I and may I  - it didn't seem to matter to the server he said please either. Experience ruined.. At $175.00 not including tip,  we won't be back."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! It was my first Brazilian steak house experience and I had SO MUCH FUN! All the different cuts of meat were fresh and delicious! The sides were so good and the salad bar was awesome! My plates were always full and my drinks kept flowing.  I tried a Brazilian Mojito (I think it what it was) while it was a bit strong, the flavor was awesome! I will definitely revisit."}
{"text":"A must whenever we come in town! I am a long time patron of Churrascaria style restaurants and this is one of my favorites. Great service, well seasoned meats, and delectable deserts. More Picanha please!"}
{"text":"We went here for a friends birthday. It was different. Unique and oddly entertaining. It's worth checking out. While we really enjoyed the atmosphere and food. We probably will not be back. Reason. It's not our cup of tea. While that's not to knock the place whatsoever."}
{"text":"The question is should I take my friends to this establishment for a dining experience? And will they want to take their friends when they come to town next time? The answer is yes. And yes. This place has energy. The people working here have good chemistry. The wait for our table is acceptable even for a holiday weekend. The food smells good. The meat passed my chewing test. I didn't get tired chewing. Simple. Salt and sugar level is ok for me. Everyone has a different scale for that so you make up your own mind. Fresh ingredients at the salad bar. You will leave here with a full stomach. Your choice. The alcoholic cocktail drink is strong. Takeaway. Ask for more fried banana. Eat it like a dessert."}
{"text":"10.21.16 This is without question was one of the greatest restaurant experiences I've ever had. Nothing but positive things to say about this place. Had the most amazing cocktails and bar service while we waited waited to be seated - Thank you D! Dinner was was phenomenal! Our server was on point with everything, made our dinner experience 10 times better - Thank you Adam for making AG's birthday a special one."}
{"text":"Thank you to the warm,curtious staff at Texas de Brazil. This place is wonderful. Oh  and the Manager is so cute and professional"}
{"text":"The Pros: Great service, great atmosphere, great salad bar options.   The Bad: Oh man were the meats salty. They were so salty that they were inedible. We told our server and they told the kitchen to tone it down on the salt and they did... but even their \"low salt\" was still way too salty. I was so disappointed.   If you go here, save your money and your blood pressure and just go for the salad bar. The salad fixings and soups were really solid. The only reason this gets 3 stars is because the service was so accommodating."}
{"text":"You have to come when you are really hungry best time. We did not eat breakfast, lunch. Our plane landed at 2 pm and made at the restaurant 5pm. Took a cab. It was great everything I have tried was great. The salad bar was the best I ever had. Wait for the lamb chops. Will definitely be back when I am in town."}
{"text":"My daughter, her son and I tried out Texas de Brazil.  As expected, the meat kept coming and was tasty. The servers were very accommodating to bring us meat that was more or less done if we wanted something different than what was brought over. In general the service was very good.  My daughter tried some of their cocktails. The tastes were very interesting, but I found them a bit expensive ($10 each for a small tumbler filled mostly with ice).  The salad bar was not exceptional one way or another. They did not run out of anything and the food looked fresh.  We were so stuffed that we did not try any deserts, but they looked yummy."}
{"text":"I had dinner with my family here tonight and I can say that I left impressed. Being greeted with alluring smells and a friendly host staff was the start to a great night. Our waiter arrived quickly after we were seated and eased us right into the experience. Immediately I felt comfortable here, as if I'd been here daily my entire life. We were directed to a plentiful salad bar that featured much more than salad. From sushi to heart of palm, the salad bar buffet already had enough to fill me up. Luckily I was warned by a family member who had been here to wait for the main event: the meat. Everywhere I looked there were men bring around skewers of different types of freshly made meats. A buffet that is brought to you and consists of sampling filet Mignon, flank steak, bacon wrapped chicken, pork, sausage, lamb, ribs, etc. Who could ask for any more? And to top it off, the wait staff was kne of the best I've ever seen. Not once did my needs go unfilled. They knew what I needed before I had a chance to realize it myself. My glass of water did not empty once, I never had to scramble for room on the table, and the waiter kept up friendly conversation the entire time. I highly recommend Texas De Brazil."}
{"text":"Great set up, all food on salad bar was fresh and cold and well presented. Servers were on top of everything and all your needs. Plenty of good food to go around with attentive carvers and the cuts were good. The Brazilian sausage was very tasty along with the ribs. Come prepared to eat and you will get your money's worth. My only complaint was the coke was basically served from a 7 oz. aluminum can for a three dollar charge. Thought that was a little much for the same thing that can be purchased at Target for .79 cents. Don't understand why they simply can't have fountain service with refills but nothing here is considered to be cost effective. I won't let that affect the overall satisfaction in this place. Good job!"}
{"text":"We booked the private room in the back for a party of 10 celebrating our friend's 40 birthday. I called in to reserve about a week ahead of time and Shanna the event manager was professional, knowledgeable and nice. She not only emailed me conformation and a copy of the menu, she also accommodated our special food requests and splitting of the bill. She also emailed me the next day to make sure everything was up to par.  We had a great time, the food was excellent, all the meats  was cooked exactly how we liked them ( with 10 people asking for the meats cooked at least 3 different ways) and the servers and gauchos were kind and professional.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I recently went to Texas de Brazil on a Tuesday at 5:30.  It was not very crowded and the customer service was excellent.  The server,  Ellen,  was very accommodating and polite.  She even refolded my napkin when I went to the restroom.  The salad bar was good, but of course nobody goes there for salad.  The salad bar included sushi and potato salad along with several soups.  The meats were excellent and the service was top notch because I always had several meats on my plate.  We requested additional filet mignon wrapped in bacon from our waitress which was brought directly to our table.  Dinner also was served with mashed potatoes and a coated banana used to clean your palate between meats.  Overall 5 out of 5 and would gladly return for a quality buffet priced at $45."}
{"text":"Upbeat place. If you're going, go hungry and expect to consume a lot of food. All the meats were delicious and tender, but don't forget to flip your red/green card. I left mine green a few times and the meats kept coming. The wait staff and meat carvers were great too and quite attentive. Oh, and if you have a military id, don't forget to tell your waiter/waitress...good discount."}
{"text":"Texas is probably my whole family's favorite dining experience. We come here to celebrate any occasion and overall have a great meal. The meats are so delicious and well prepared. They have an awesome salad bar. Fifi I mention the sangria and caipirinhas(Brazilian drink mmm)? We look forward to eating here everytime! Try it, it's well worth it and unbeatable in flavor."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now. First as part of a pay off four and secondly as a party of 8. Both times the food was good but service was lacking. I felt like the waitress assumed we would be satisfied with the food conning by so drinks and side dishes went unfilled.  It gets 3 Stars for food alone."}
{"text":"Celebrated my husband's birthday here. Service was great, food is awesome, and the desserts are to die for. Keep in mind the drinks and dessert is separate, but you get all you can eat meat and salad with the sides."}
{"text":"This our first time here we ugly eat on the strip but we thought we try something different when we walked in late in the afternoon  they asked us if we had reservation for the table we did not so they asked us to wait few minutes passed same size party walked in without reservation they got seated right a way when we asked they hosts say oh sorry they had reservation without the wait time 45m to one hour clear she was clearly not telling the truth we where standing right next to here and we heard the whole thing after talking it over  we decided to take our business somewhere else diffently not good place"}
{"text":"I purchased a vip dining card. I called today to make a reservation and I'm told they won't accept my reservation. I asked about walk ins and I was told a party of 5 is going to be difficult to get seated and 3 to 4 hour wait time!! Your restaurant sold me and many others a service, you should be able to provide it!!"}
{"text":"The best all you can eat meat in town!! Great quality of meat, very big buffet and everything so tasty !! Love this place"}
{"text":"First time trying Brazilian BBQ and we were not disappointed! The men bringing around the various meats were all very friendly and accommodating. The salad bar was good and so was the service. Come hungry!"}
{"text":"This place is so much fun.  The staff is superb, and the food is great, too.  It's pricey as all get-out, but sometimes we get a coupon and when we do, we head out there."}
{"text":"Their lobster bisque to to die for!! It doesn't have any lobster in it but it's the best lobster bisque I've ever had. My dad loved it and that's all it matters. :) I'm like a 5'1 girl so I don't really eat a lot but if you are a meat person, this is the place to go! My dad loved the house special and kept asking the guy who carries it to come back! lol I absolutely loved their cheesy bread and they will refill them if u ask."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and the service is always great. Tonight I was invited to a birthday celebration here with reservations at 9pm for a party of 12. 9pm on a Wednesday? For 12? I was so concerned that the servers would be tired and ready to go home, which would affect our service. Boy was I wrong. This was by far the best visit I've had. Stacy and Halle went above and beyond to make sure that everything was perfect. The hostess (a blond with glasses) was also especially attentive as well as two of the gauchos who's names I can't remember, but one appeared to be in charge and is somewhat older than most of the other gauchos. He and I had a laugh over me dropping a piece of meat into my glass of water. :) The other was tall with glasses and I believe he is from Brazil. Both were very, very informative and very pleasant even at the late hour. The manager also stopped by to make sure everything was perfect. I listed all these people because I hope management sees the review and rewards all the listed parties, they are assets and deserve to be commended.   I want to specifically mention Halle and Stacy again because we had a very lively table that required quite a bit of assistance and they took it in stride. Halle was very sweet and Stacy was probably the most knowledgeable server I've had. She offered drinks I've never been offered (which was spot on) and explained anything we asked for more info on. All in all, if you can't tell, I love this place and recommend it to meat lovers and not so meat lovers alike."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time last weekend for a birthday dinner and the service was absolutely phenomenal! The salad bar was amazing and the meats were cooked perfectly. Definitely worth my 50 minute drive . Can't wait to come back !"}
{"text":"The food was fabulous and the service fantastic. They kept the food coming, it was hot and super flavorful.  Andrew our server was fabulous."}
{"text":"My parents originally wanted to take me to Grand Concourse for my 16th birthday, but they had forgotten to get a reservation before hand. We had walked past Texas de Brazil and thought it looked fun so we went in and it was packed and smelled delicious. We got a table within 5 minutes despite how crowded it was.  It was such a fun experience!!! Having the traditional gauchos come up to the table and offer you food was the highlight of my night. If you are a meat lover (like I am) this is absolutely the place for you. I tried a lot of everything to be honest. My favorite was the filet mignon and the lamb. If I'm not mistaken, you pay about $40 for an all you can eat. I definitely ate well over $40 in meat. They also have a great \"salad bar\" that is so much more! Imported meats cheeses breads roasted veggies!  Also, I have a severe peanut allergy that we told the hostess about. She was very nice about it and the manager met us at the table and guided me around the salad bar pointing out what I could and couldn't eat. The whole experience was memorable and a great way to celebrate my birthday"}
{"text":"My family decided to have our first meal of 2016 here at Texas de Brazil. I'm so damn glad they did. I've never been to a restaurant like this before. They had some of the best meats I've ever had. You better come hungry! I tried as many meats as I can. The garlic sirloin had to be my favorite. The salad bar had lots of options also. It may be a bit pricey but it's sure as hell worth it. Definitely recommend coming here. 2016 started off right!"}
{"text":"Great service, tasty food.  I'm glad we finally got a good Brazilian steak house in Pittsburgh!  I've been to the other two in PGH and the food and service do not come close to comparing.  I've been to Fogo De Chao (multiple cities), Chima, and a few other Brazilian Steakhouse as I travel the county for my job and this is right up there with them in food quality and service.  I'm not sure what the other reviewers are saying about the bad service, but the service here was awesome.  They were fast and dealt extremely well with getting the meat we wanted as well as cooked to the right temperature for various likings at our table.  Simply put....I'll be back.  Can't say the same for the greenforest cafe or the palms.   btw...my wife is originally from Brazil and I've eaten at Churrascaria in Sao Paulo and Rio in addition to all the chains here in the USA, so I can confidently say this is definitely one of the better ones!"}
{"text":"Food was great, but at times the meat rotation was lacking. I got a lot of the same thing before something new came around."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful restaurant. Unlimited food. 4 stars because I have to pay for refills on soda. Bottomless drinks would be wonderful. Maybe an extra 20 dollars on the bill for bottomless drinks."}
{"text":"Fantastic service and a wonderful dining experience. Pricey for us, as two of us dined with drinks for 160.00 dollars but we felt it was worth every penny.  Our waiter Joayquim was professional and attentive. The atmosphere is loud because it is a popular spot and reservations are highly recommended. The staff accommodated our dining requests by putting is at a table off to the side as we were celebrating our anniversary. Needless to say we will make it a top choice for our special occasions. It is high enough prices that we would not be able to make it a regular dining experience."}
{"text":"We had an amazing experience tonight. It was our first time here. The service was outstanding. Our server Justine was attentive without being overbearing. And the manager Tucker was friendly and entertaining. He definitely made our experience here memorable! We'll be returning."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service and atmosphere. I love Brazilian food and this place delivers. Our server was attentive but not intrusive. Explained the menu and how the service works clearly. Once signal you are ready for meat, the \"gauchos\" are at your table ready to slice and they just keep coming with all sorts and of carnivorous delights. Go hungry!"}
{"text":"8/17/2017 updated review  I came in tonight at 630 with a reservation. We were greeted promptly upon arrival by a hostess that I remember from my last visit. she's very nice and polite. Although the girl who seated us was lacking personality. Our server on the other hand was amazing! He made sure everything came to our table so my guests could sample everything I raved about! Their favorite was the garlic sirloin! I agree that's my favorite too! Definitely suggest making reservation because I heard them quoting 1 hour wait for no reservation. I'm glad I made mine! Will definitely come back again again again!        I came in today for lunch 1/4/17. All you can eat for $32.99! I came in with a party of 3,immediately we were greeted by the sweetest hostess! She gave us an awesome piece of advice to not go over board at the salad area and save room for the meats! She was right! Although, they have an amazing salad bar with everything you can imagine, the meats are the star of the show! Our server was extremely attentive to our needs, she made sure we really enjoyed our experience. We were on or lunch break so we didn't stay for long but I'll definitely be back for dinner! Amazing staff, amazing food!"}
{"text":"Carnivores' heaven!!  Very nice restaurant, meat was high quality, salad bar was amazing, service was excellence, and the atmosphere was great. So many good reviews to this restaurant and I agree with them 100%. The meat was delicious, juicy, tender and tasty. Even the chicken breast was so juicy. It's really easy to dry the chicken breast on the grill (in my opinion) but I was surprised how good they cooked the meat. $50 per head but they offer special price to children and discounts to military, veterans, firefighters, teachers, seniors etc. Don't forget to check out the web site and make reservation before going there."}
{"text":"I love this place.. You will try and eat so much meat they might have to bring you out on a stretcher.   The buffet is not the best ever... but lets be real.. you came for the meats wrapped in other meats.. etc."}
{"text":"The restaurant is clean. My husband and I went in on a Monday night, the place was pretty much empty but the service was still pretty slow.   I was a little disappointed at the selections from the salad bar. I guess my expectations was a little too high. I have seen more stuff at other Brazilian steakhouses.   The meat tasted good for the most part.  However, we wish that the meat servers would stop asking us if we needed more meat. We both had our little meat sign flipped over to the red side, but the meat servers still came over and asked all the time. The sign on the table basically meant nothing to them. What's the point of having it?"}
{"text":"My yelp had been deleted, but I had to write another review here at Texas De Brazil. Food is always excellent. Never had a terrible time here. Only thing lacking, me and my husband waited 15 minutes for our drinks. But maybe it was a good thing. We ended up eating ALOT. Will be back"}
{"text":"This is the first time I get here. Beautiful delication and good service. Taste good."}
{"text":"I was at the restaurant last night and went at peak dinner rush: 6:30 PM EST.  I was alone and celebrating a special occasion, I was seated with in minutes and the food from  the buffet was fresh and delicious.  I requested meat and the very kind server, hostess and manager made sure that the meat serves came over as often as possible. There was no less than 10 groups from what I saw last night and the entire crew was busting their butts getting to everyone accordingly. The  meats were fresh, cooked to perfection and just the right amount of seasoning.  This is now my favorite place and I am grateful!"}
{"text":"Went this past Monday and the food was excellant.  The server Sonny and the Manager Edson were very friendly and provided excellant service.  The house Picana is my favorite.  Check it out."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, the service is TERRIBLE. I have no problem paying $50+ per person, but when I am paying for a meal that costs hundreds of dollars I expect to be treated with common courtesy.  To be completely honest, I have received better service from MCDONALDS than I have from Texas De Brazil. Nearly every waitress at Texas De Brazil walks around with a chip on her shoulder and gives everyone at the table an attitude.  The last two times I went to this restaurant we had to deal with a snotty and rude wait staff that ruined the meal for everyone at the table.  There was one evening where myself and 5 others arrived about 30 minutes before closing and had the rudest, least attentive waitress I have ever encountered in any establishment. Ever. Not exaggerating at all. She gave us attitude the whole time, didn't smile, didn't ask how anyone was doing, and looked ticked off, miserable, and pissed/annoyed at us the whole time. She didn't notice, or care, when we were missing a place setting and needed more silverware. She made us all feel very uncomfortable and unwelcome. We asked her for a rare cut of meat to be delivered to the table and she gave us attitude about that and made it seem like it was a huge problem. We should have gotten up and left right then.  At the end of the meal we asked for dessert, and once again, received an enormous amount of attitude. I think she was the snottiest at that point, and after she took the dessert order we had had enough of being treated like shit and took the dessert in to-go boxes. I completely regretted going out to dine that evening.  We hoped that that treatment was us catching them on a bad night, and decided to give them one more try...  The last time I went to the restaurant I had made reservations for a large party of 40 people. The majority of the people in our party are professional tattoo artists, many of which have been featured on national and international television numerous times. We all came to the restaurant directly from a tattoo convention in Pittsburgh, and due to this, half of our party ended up arriving later than our reservation time.  I checked in with the hostess at 7PM along with 5-6 others and she directed us to wait at the bar. About 30-45 minutes later I received a call on my cell phone from the hostess, asking me where my party was and if we were still going to make it to dinner. Um, didn't I check in with her already? Did she forget? She smoking some mary jane?  While we were waiting at the bar, this pillow faced woman (who also has an attitude) approached me and curtly asked how everyone would be paying and then, after giving us a really fake attempt at a smile, immediately left. She didn't even attempt to be courteous, didn't ask how we were doing. Wow.  I had to leave the meal before everyone else due to not feeling well, so I got up and tracked down our waitress to ask her to pay for my bill and two others. Apparently this was a huge problem for her, and she asked me, \"How many glasses of wine did your friend have? Did she pay at the bar or at the table? She ordered a creme brulee right?\" ISN'T THAT THE WAIT STAFF'S JOB TO KEEP TRACK OF THE ORDER? That is NOT my responsibility lady, that is YOURS.  I was trying to talk to her about the bill and she rudely walked away from me in the middle of the conversation! I couldn't believe it! I had to chase her down AGAIN to have her take care of the bill. How utterly and unbelievably RUDE.  The worst part of the entire evening? I later found out that they DOUBLE CHARGED THE TAB ON MY FRIEND. Yes, that's right. I PAID FOR HER ENTIRE TAB, AND THEY DELIVERED THE SAME BILL AFTER I LEFT, BILLING US TWICE FOR THE SAME MEAL. Unbelievable.  The hiring manager at Texas De Brazil needs to get his head out of his ass and fire the rude and inattentive wait staff.  I have worked in the hospitality industry for years as a busser, hostess, and waitress, and I would NEVER have treated my patrons as badly as I was treated by these jerks. I am so appalled at the service I received at Texas De Brazil that I will never return. I don't care how good the food is - I refuse to PAY to be treated like shit."}
{"text":"This is not my favorite Brazilian steakhouse, but it's a Brazilian steakhouse so it's pretty good. The price is standard around $45 per person. It includes all the meat you can eat and a salad bar. Atmosphere is decent tho it can get loud. The waitstaff is friendly and most of all the meat is delicious.  My only complaint about the set up is the salad bar, it's very tight two people cant fit side by side so it's a bit tricky to get your cheese and salads. That's not a terrible thing though as you should concentrate on the meat anyway it what you paid for.   The meat is always on the rarer side but that's standard for these types of restaurants... You can ask for meat more well done and they will accomidate you"}
{"text":"I came in this evening 7/14/16. I wish I would have made a reservation, they get pretty packed here!    Everyone was absolutely pleasant! The hostesses were all so friendly and professional. Our server was beyond outstanding and very knowledgeable about the restaurant! He had such a great attitude! They have a great selection in the salad bar like lobster bisque soup, sushi, salami rice ect.. , the couscous salad was by far my favorite! You'll want to take it easy at the salad and save room for the meats! They seriously come around with so much to choose from. The meats were all delicious, my favorite was the garlic sirloin followed by the flank steak. All the meats seasoned to perfection, It just melts in your mouth! For dessert we shared a Chocolate Mousse cake. It is super rich but so delicious!   Be sure you make a reservation and come hungry!"}
{"text":"Never disappoints. Their lobster bisque is delicious and their meats are to die for! Never had trouble getting of my favorites because the servers are always coming around to offer you their wide selection."}
{"text":"It's was a great atmosphere  the service was great and the food was better. My only issue with this place  was there bathroom  it was a mess. In one of the stalls was a used diaper and the others had pee all over them. I would recommend  to my friends. They just to watch there bathroom."}
{"text":"First time going here we ran into a red flag of a hostess but decided to give it a try since it was my first time there.  Numerous types of tender delicious meats and a few nice side options to add at the buffet area.  I suggest being smart and not totally starving yourself for this meal, but to have a light lunch so you can take advantage of the options and possibly gain 20 pounds.  Great atmosphere, food, and dessert.  So great we came back a few more times."}
{"text":"My aunt made the reservation to this place. It was PACKED, but once i sat down i understood why. The food was DELICIOUS. It is Buffet style, so we definitely got our moneys worth. Were from California so i was not expecting the meat to be served to us on giant sticks,fresh off the grill. They literally cut the piece of meat you would like onto your plate. It was an interesting type of buffet!  The filet mignon and house sirloin were definitely my favorites of the night! Also their grapes (covered in blue cheese and mayo) were surprisingly delicious! The only thing i was disappointed in was the chicken. I didnt really enjoy the flavor of the chicken. It tasted dry at times compared to the beef! I couldn't stop eating the red meat! Even when i was full-just eating for the taste!   Everyone was so friendly and Richie our server was definitely THE BEST. 5stars for customer service! Overall very good experience! Too bad they dont have one in California!"}
{"text":"I've come to this place several times, and each time the service is spectacular.  Even recently, when I've become gluten and soy intolerant, the manager offered to walk me through the salad bar and pointed out all things that I should avoid.  He was extremely knowledgeable, and I appreciated his kindness.  All that aside...the salad bar selection is terrific.  Be prepared to make more than one trip.  Love the smoked salmon!  The steak is plentiful, and if it isn't cooked to your liking, you can make requests and they're back in a flash with your preference.  The house cut is my fav!  I recommend reservations, as this place is always slammed."}
{"text":"outstanding service, delicious food, awesome desserts. Recommended."}
{"text":"Me and my hubby really really really love this restaurant    Great atmosphere , fancy design ,,, clean tableware ,,I like blue water glass too    Today's service was great ( always good )  Our waitress was nice kind but not too much .perfect distance she made us really comfortable .. Even tho not our server tho ...whn I wanted order more drink ,, I could wait our waitress but I saw someone waiter I asked if he can find our waitress ... But he said he can take our order too .. ( I really like it cuz like this big restaurant if not our server then they Dnt take our order ) anyway very happy dinning    Of course food is amazing !!  We didn't want to get stuff forever ... We ate really really alooot !!  Oh salad bar is great !  Everything looks so flesh and yummy ! Lobster soup  cheese  big asparagus   One things I wish that food lil bit less sodium perfect to me ...  I will wake up middle of night and I have to drink A lot of water tonight ....I think meat are very seasoning so jasmine rice should b more plain or jus lil garlic n butter perfect for me (-; )"}
{"text":"we made reservations here for my wifes moms birthday and nine of our family mebers. we were quickly seated and the atmosphere was great and the food even better they have a great salad bar and the waiters are very polite and professional. the food was incredible and the parking was no problem. we love this place and will definitely be going there again."}
{"text":"If you are a meat lover this is is a place to be! I kept on asking for well done but for some reason they forgot about us. The other part I don't like about this is that my table area seems to be dark and I couldn't see what I am eating. I ate the mashed potato and I bit something crunchy since it was so dark I couldn't tell what it was. Overall the food is SO-SO. The ladies in the front needs to improve their customer service starting with saying \"Hi\"."}
{"text":"My friend got sick to her stomach right at the table about 20 minutes into dinner.  No attention from the staff for her discomfort and no discount on the check. Very disappointed.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"Good selection of meat and all you can eat. Service was great, some meat was well underdone almost raw, lamb was aweful but everything else was good. Very very expensive two of us two drinks and dessert with 20% tip was 170.00."}
{"text":"If you like meat, this is the place to go, but definitely go HUNGRY. From the salad bar to all the meats brought to your table, you will enjoy every bite. The filet is to die for and the Brazilian special meat melts in your mouth.   My wife loved the leg of lamb and lamb chops. And it just keeps coming and coming. Eventually you have to stop, and then they tempt you with devine desserts. Definitely a special occasion place to have a delicious meal with loved ones."}
{"text":"Lower than one star would have been my choice but alas I am stifled by the rating system.  My first time ever coming here to eat let alone to celebrate an anniversary with my gf the front desk staff turned me off from ever coming back.    Inexperienced customer service seems to be part of the application process. What a shame, to think we chose to attempt dining here over our favorite sushi bar.    Well at least our sushi won't disappoint.    For not even getting a chance to try their menu I would rather continue my days saying that I've never been here nor tried their food.  Perhaps that could have been their saving grace, unfortunately I couldn't tell you."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Brazilian steakhouse In the west but a bit pricy. Try the sirloin strip which is very tasty or the bacon wrap chicken breast for flavor wilder than the west. However, save your tummy for the filet mignon because it will make other steaks taste like cardboard but hey, if you want the best then save room for it. The salad bar are amazing because it's a meal by itself. Go ahead and try this place because you will wish why did your eat at other Brazilian steakhouse. It's a both a meatatarian and vegetarian paradise for either party."}
{"text":"This restaurant was amazing there is a fifty item salad bar. Our waiter Matt was awesome. The meat is very delicious and it just keeps on coming all you can eat. A little pricey but it is ultimately worth it. Great place for special occasions."}
{"text":"I love this place. Te atmosphere is alway great and the food is amazing.  Staff is very friedly and helpful"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying everyone was very friendly and the service was good. The food however was not very good. I guess I was expecting more since I have been to many other Brazilian steakhouses. The quality of the meat was just not there. My wife and I were also feeling nauseous later at night after our meal. It may or may not have been related to the food. I will never try another Texas de Brazil and recommend you don't either."}
{"text":"It was my birthday and I wanted to go somewhere different. Well I picked the right place. The salad bar was amazing the staff was incredible. Then came the meats. Turn the little circle from red to green and off you go. What a great place."}
{"text":"Oh my! The Best steak I've ever eaten. My son and daughter N law took me to taste for myself, they had been telling me about this place since they've been going. Different steaks made different ways,not to mention lamb, chicken, sausage, beef ribs, well not to mention the sides.i GT hooked on the potatoes also. Not enough space to tell you All about it .You have to go yourself. Still thanking my daughter N law and son for taking me...Oh yeah, and ready to go back!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for dinner to celebrate my birthday, and beforehand he had told me to not eat at all throughout the day so as to come extra hungry. I was glad I listened. Our server, Ryan was welcoming, knowledgeable, professional and friendly throughout our meal. In terms of the food, I was a great fan of the salad bar and was particularly fond of the various fresh cheeses and marinated shrimp. We got two sides with our meal; I especially enjoyed the garlic mashed potatoes which I was sad to not have the stomach to finish. The core of the dinner was the AYCE meat (various types - my favorites were the parmesan chicken, filet mignon wrapped in bacon, and sausage) which I had my doubts about initially because I personally am not a fan of red or pink meat, and they mentioned that they cook the meats to default medium to medium rare. However, the meats I did try that did not fall under those categories were amazing and had perfect texture and juiciness. My boyfriend ate so many meats, several times to the point where he was stuffed and then past the point of being stuffed, after which he continued to say yes because, as he told me, \"it's just too good to say no to\". We had no room for dessert but ordered the chocolate mousse cake to-go which was amazing as well."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Service was very slow as far as drink refills and clearing of the plates. I ordered a coke, and they bring me an 8.5 oz bottle. I asked for a couple of refills and when we got the check it was over $10.00 for 25.5oz of coke a cola (which is equivalent to 2 cans of soda). When asking the server she said \"Well it comes in the fancy little bottle.\" I ordered a coke not the bottle(which was thrown away). At $49.99 a person, I think they can come up with a better solution on beverages, and how to make there customers return. That was just rediculous, and I will not be returning!"}
{"text":"Came here for my friend's birthday dinner and this place did not disappoint. My favorite meat is lamb. Their lamb was super tender and just melted in my mouth. Thinking about it makes me want to go back. I've been to fogo as well, but prefers Texas de Brazil better."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant love the colors.The food is delicious and the Brazilian Margarita is good..However the service was to stuffy. Our waitress Chelsea was running around like a hot mess.We really didn't need a 30 min explanation everytime we asked her  question .very robotic like. Took way to long for drinks.We were done with meat by the time we got potatoes and the plantains. Overall food was good but not worth cost for bad service."}
{"text":"Phenominal food, great staff, when I left the button green side up I was not disappointed!! Ill be eating there again!!"}
{"text":"best place by far for the meat lover!!!"}
{"text":"CARNIVORE HEAVEN! Now before you get that opening wrong, let me be clear...I had one of the most romantic evenings of my adult life at this place.  The restaurant is nicely dim lit. Everyone is very well dressed if you come in the evening and the person that greeted us was immediately there to take care of us and get us seated.  To make sure we weren't going to have to wait I of course booked a table in advance ;-)!  So now let me continue by talking about what you really want to hear, \"the food\".  \"Hypnotizingly Delicious\" if you could put that into those words.  Any and all meats are brought fresh and hot individually systematically to your table, \"IF\" you flip your card up indicating the color green for \"more meat\"; red means no more or, not now.  The salad bar as well was very fresh with great assortments to choose from.  And as if that wasn't enough, if you somehow managed to find a spot available inside your body cavity to consider desert, out comes the waiter with an assortment of deserts that will make you shed a tear.  The choices were so difficult we each chose two and took them home because we absolutely had no room to eat at that moment hahaha.  When shared one each later that evening they were exactly what expected from the beginning to the end of a magical and magnificent evening at Texas de Brazil.  One small note:  Gentlemen, if your significant other does not like spending money, do not let your partner see the bill as this place is a strong bit on the pricey end.  However, for an anniversary event or a rare, special occasion, I have to say it was worth every penny.  Not something I would do every month, but definitely once a year regardless of what my bank account holds.  Hope anyone that reads this finds this helpful.  My wife absolutely loved the food and atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"I knew this would be an expensive meal before going. Overall 3 1/2 stars. We had 2 adults, 2 kids (6&8) and bill was $200 after tip. We had food plus pitcher of sangria and ginger ale for kids because that was the only drink served that was refillable. Also split 1 slice of chocolate mousse cake. With adjustments for drinks and kids meals(see below) this could easily be 4.5 stars and overall value worth the visit.   Food: 4 1/2 stars because the meats are amazing, salad bar alone is a mEal and quite impressive. The meat comes with two cinnamon sugar plantains and mashed potatoes. There is jasmine rice, wine portobello shrooms etc on buffet to compliment the meat course. Kids enjoy the salad bar so if we went again I wouldn't waste the meat on them. Stick to salad bar for kids as there's bacon, shrimp, salmon, cold cuts, vegetables, rice, fruit for them. You can save money this way. Older kids however would enjoy the meat. Only downside is beef served med-rare. We specially requested med-well and I felt the beef/ lamb cuts were not as good quality. They had more fat on them. Also the lobster bisque had zero lobster in it. It was like a sherry lobster favored broth which was disappointing.  Drinks: 1 star. Way too expensive. I enjoy wine but the markups here are 3x or more for a bottle. Rex Goliath is 10-12$ and it was priced at $39. In stead we got a pitcher of sangria which had no alcohol whatsoever. For $29 it was like an expensive fruit filled pitcher of juice. Kids drinks aren't refillable except ginger ale. Stick to water while you're here. About 20% of the bill can be saved by sticking to water and drinks here are a rip-off.   Ambiance: 4.5 stars. Restaurant is well decorated, CLEAN (bathrooms and buffet were in top condition). Took away half star because the tables are a bit close for my taste and we had a stroller for a sleeping baby.   Service: 4 1/2 stars. Our waitress was great. She always had a clean plate for us and was very attentive. I took half star away because even when our cards were red the meat servers still kept coming by. They almost swarm your table which can be overwhelming a little bit trying to get your own meat and manage kids who need theirs cut up. That said you definitely get a full plate of great tasting meat. They also don't rush you out. Managers as well were on the floor the entire time making sure everything was running smoothly and asked everyone how the were enjoying their meals. Dirty Plates are quickly gathered and new ones magically appearing as well. This restaurant gets the importance of good service."}
{"text":"The food was good the side dishes we're okay I did notice that they didn't bring out a lot of meats until the end tell your almost done eating not cool and I think you don't notice a okay place eat ....little pricey for what you getting"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant great food, fantastic service. The meats are so tasty, I love that you have different choices, one of my favorite neat was the lamb. Omg to die for I think I want to go back just thinking about it."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying the bar menu at Texas de Brazil, but when my friend and I arrived at the bar, we were incredibly disappointed.  Not only were we completely ignored when we sat down, we were still ignored after I went up to the bar to get menus.  I would have understood if it had been a busy night, but there were at least 3 bartenders just standing behind the bar doing nothing.  The food may be great (although I only know from other reviews), but the service is terrible.  If I could give this location zero stars, I would."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great ambiance. Very good date night restaurant."}
{"text":"Nice for a Special Occasion, food ok.....I  prefer their location in Orlando much better !"}
{"text":"Very yummy Brazilian restaurant. You can eat here until you explode. All the meat is cooked just right.  Great salad bar too.  Our server Alexander 1097 was absolutely Excellent. He made the experience both authentic and spectacular."}
{"text":"Amazing experience. We loved our server Michelle.  Everything is juicy and fresh. Totally worth the price."}
{"text":"Next time I'll skip the overpriced food and just have a glass of wine:(  Meat, and I tried 3 types was tough, devoid of taste and overcooked.  Salad bar, really who has salad bars anymore.  Sides of bananas and mashed potatoes not edible.  Two stars was generous!"}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant. Service was great. Food was good, with many choices for sides. Meats were pretty good, you can even ask them to prepare them for you like you want but I thought they needed more meat choices. My favorite was the Brazilian sausage. No free refills. Price for this buffet could be a bit less."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came in tonight to celebrate our anniversary. The restaurant is absolutely beautiful. The hostess were very polite and professional. We got seated within a few minutes of being checked in for our reservation.  When we got seated, our server Loan explained the concept of the restaurant and suggested drinks.She was so warm and extremely helpful! we absolutely loved her!   On top of the Salad bar there's a beautiful floral arrangement. This salad bar is huge! It can be a meal on its own! she told us to pace ourselves so we can save room for meats because we're more than welcome to return back to the salad bar at anytime. I'm glad I listened to her.   The meats were definitely the star of the show! The top sirloin the house special. Was my favorite! It melts in your mouth. The beef ribs are also a must try! Every cut that we had was cooked to perfection! You can request through your server if you want more of a certain meat!   Desserts! So many to choose from. our server came over with an assortment tray of desserts and described each one so beautifully! I wanted them all! We ended up getting the creme brûlée! It was delicious!They even decorated the plate with Happy Anniversary for you  Overall our experience here was one of the best we've had in a while! Definitely try this place out! The service is beyond amazing and the food is out of this world!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Texas de Brazil and Fogo de Chao restaurants for the last 15 years, including the Fairfax VA Texas location as recently as August 2016 which was a great visit. This visit to the Westlake location was extremely disappointing....from the caipirinhas to the meat. We ordered 2 caipirinhas and when they arrived, I noticed right away that the limes had just been put in the glass rather than being crushed (they were not even squeezed). I went to the manager and mentioned this and he came over to the table so that he could see the drinks. He agreed that they were not made correctly and offered to make new ones. I told him that we would drink them but that I wanted him to know there was an issue. I then saw him go over to the bar and talk to the bartender. We ordered another round later in the meal and they still were not made properly. Again, I brought i t to the mangager's attention and offered to make new ones which was not the point of bringing the issue to his attention. The fact that he discussed it with the bartender and that is still was an issue is not acceptable. As for the meat, the waitress made a point of saying the meat was brought \"medium rare\" and I mentioned that I wanted mine medium. The gauchos repeatedly brought medium rare (with much actually being rare) and when I asked for medium it took too long to arrive (the restaurant was not that crowded). I mentioned it to the waitress and manager which helped a little but some was still to rare. At this point, I gave up on eating any more of the meat and gave up bringing it to managment's attention (in fact, I didnt see the manager for the last 30 minutes we were in the restaurant and he was not around when we left). Another issue, although minor, was the fact that this location did not offer Caesar dressing. This is the first location where Caesar dressing was no t served. As a high end churrascaria, I expect the Texas de Brazil experience to be the same at each of your locations...this was simply not the case. If this had been my first visit, I would surely never return based upon the experience at the Westlake location. When you spend approximately $175 before tip for three people, the service and food should warrant the cost. This location has been open since February 2016 so I would expect it to meet the quality that I expect when visiting one of your locations. Needless to say, I will not be visiting this location when I visit I friends in Westlake, as it does not represent the quality I have experienced at your other locations."}
{"text":"We have been here several times and think it is better than the other option in the area. The selection at the salad bar is fantastic. There is not just salad, but smoked salmon, olives, cheese, shrimp, and sushi.   We have also taken advantage of their carry-out, which is not widely advertised."}
{"text":"Fist time here. Wanted to ezperience. Omg so good. Must try everything, leave plenty of room for meat. Waiters and waitresses over the top nice and helpful. Love the outfit/uniform of meat servers. Cant wait to go again"}
{"text":"The food was ok.  I have had better at other Churrascarias but the food was not bad.  Am only giving 2 stars because of a major problem.  On our second night there we ordered a bottle of wine.  We enjoyed it so we ordered a second bottle - something was wrong with this bottle.  We called the waiter and manager right away.    They took the bottle away, never replaced it and still charged us for the 2nd bottle anyway.  The manager told us \"to bad\" we are charging you no matter what and we can not return the unfinished bottle because we thew it away.  I have left 5 messages and one email for the General Manager over a two week period and - well, i guess keeping customers happy is not important to Texas de Brazil!"}
{"text":"So coming from a small island, I've never had the opportunity to partake in Brazilian food. But my oh my, I'm so glad I came here. This is an all you can eat meat place. They have this huge salad bar that consists of veggies, bread, cold meats, soup of the day, hot starch, and cheese. Our server was a very friendly lady, sorry forgot to ask her her name, who always made sure we were doing alright. The men that came around with the meat on the stick were really friendly, and even if we didn't have our card flipped they would ask us if we wanted more meat.  The meal includes bottomless nonalcoholic drinks and a dessert of your choosing. Now let's talk about meat. I'm personally a girl who loves her salt, species, and rare to med rare meat. Also I've been to my share of steakhouses that for the most part don't impress me. But this meat actually met my standards. My favorites were the Brazilian picanha, brazilian alcatra, and lamb chops. These meats were tender, moist, tasty, and actually medium rare. Overall I really like this place, and think the rest of my family would enjoy this too. Can't wait to eat here again when I visit Vegas next time!"}
{"text":"Been going to TDB for about 6 years now. I can't get enough. One has now opened in Pittsburgh n its great. I used to not be able to decide which I liked better, Fogo or TDB but I must say TDB has won the battles my last few times comparing the two. The lamb chops are only one rib now but who cares. Get twice as many!  What's not to like? Yeah it's like 50 bucks a person but I like sushi and this is cheap compared to that. And I can eat lusciously cooked meat till I'm dizzy!  Its the American dream.  Update.  6-8-2014 I edited and deleted  a prior update in which my office staff and I were treated like shit at the front by the hostesses and female manager. Believe me I am overly polite. Anyway corporate apologized and after swearing I'd never go back to this tdb location (I've had nothing but fantastic experiences at all othe locations) I broke down to appease my protein addiction and came back.   The wait staff is awesome. The food is awesome. I stick to my guns tho. I don't care if they black list me when I go in....the dead beat hostesses and the female manager are about as friendly as dead fish.   Everything else is great!  I'll be back and I'll just ignore the greeters. If u can call them that."}
{"text":"We celebrated my sons graduation.  He had his choice and luckily picked this one.   Great service by the waiter, Luiz, and all of the meat guys.  Everyone made sure we had our needs met.  They even brought out one of the cooks to review their gluten free items with my son and his girlfriend.  Salad bar was great.  Lobster bisque was awesome.  Great selection of salads and cheeses,  all were very fresh and visually pleasing. The Picanha was my favorite, the filets were a close second.  Good time for our family, we will be back."}
{"text":"This was my first time a the Pittsburgh location.  I have mixed feelings compared to my visits to the Ft Worth, TX location.  The food was good, the service was average with a \"rushed\" feel.  The location is all open inside and pretty loud.  They were very busy when we visited on a Saturday evening.  We had reservations, but still had to wait for a table.  That is a little annoying to me.  This place really noisy and in my opinion has too many tables crammed in.  The wine I had ordered wasn't available.  The server did not know anything about wine or drinks.  Seemed like college kids working at the place.  You could see that the servers were rushing everywhere.  There were not as many people serving meats as the Ft Worth, TX location.  There were kids all over the place and at the salad bar eating right off it with no staff doing much about the situation.  Mostly parents to blame on that deal, but also part managing staff as well.  Overall ok experience, but was not what I was expecting from previous visits to other locations.  You can wear jeans and a tee-shirt here and be just fine.  I will go back, but I'm not in a rush to visit the place again."}
{"text":"Meh.  Not terrible but not very good either.  I've been to several Brazilian steakhouses and this one was pretty disappointing in comparison.  Dirty lettuce on the salad bar, oversalted meat sometimes only lukewarm or overcooked.  Long wait for server to start our meal.  At $45/person (without drinks or dessert) it's much too expensive for what they deliver.  There are better options."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Stacy was absolutley brilliant! The staff is anazing as well as allthe foods and drinks my husband and I live this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I travel a lot and we love Texas De brazil. We have been to over a dozen locations across the country. When this location opened close to home we were excited. Since opening we have eaten here maybe 7 times. Each experience has been wonderful. Lots of restaurants can create a wonderful experience, however they often fall short at doing it consistently. This Texas De Brazil has shown us consistent service, food quality, and ambiance.   Each visit has included a visit from Craig the manager who always makes sure we are enjoying ourselves.   Keep it up, we will be back. Beef ribs rule"}
{"text":"Amazing dining experience! The selection of meats are exemplary and the staff is amazing! Thiago is the best!"}
{"text":"I started this yelp account recently just to write a review about this place!   I came in last Friday night for my sisters birthday. The restaurant is absolutely beautiful! $50 for a full salad bar and meats?! You can't beat that! Once we were seated we were greeted by our server Loan? She explained to us how the restaurant worked since it was out first time. She also acknowledged my sisters birthday right away and said to save room for dessert because it was on her! I thought that gesture was sweet!  The salad bar was amazing! Many options to choose from the couscous salad was my favorite! For soup they have lobster bisque, which was so rich and delightful.   When you flip the disk to green it's non stop meats!! My favorite cut was their house specialty! Melts in your mouth! Loan constantly checked on us and our drinks were never empty! She was so attentive and also very kind!   For desserts we ended up getting one each. chocolate cake, creme brûlée and banana foster. The chocolate cake was delicious! They even wrote happy 17th birthday with a candle for my sister which made it so personable and nice!   Overall, the service here is impeccable! The food was absolutely delicious! We will definitely be returning for future occasions!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Platters of meat walking by in every direction!  So many to choose from even within their side items too!"}
{"text":"I went here a few weeks ago and I tried their chicken which is pretty good but the meat was all undercooked so I asked the waiter if they could bring my table some chicken so then he said ok but we waited 30 minutes and when we asked him if it was ready he completely forgot and I said it was okay, but then he gave the chicken we specifically ordered to a different table and when I asked him where the chicken was he said he gave the last of it to a different table which really pissed me off, so we left and will never go back."}
{"text":"Best restaurant I've ever been to and gone several times you just can't stop eating the awesome meat"}
{"text":"Service: 5 stars - very attentive, water glasses were always full, manager stopped by our table and our waiter was always available if we needed anything  Atmosphere: 5 stars - decor was very nice  Food: 3 stars - some of the meats were too salty for us and some were over cooked. That was disappointing. The salad bar was not very impressive at all. We wished there were more choices at the salad bar.   Overall, we will return and give them another chance."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a great new dining experience at Texas De Brazil, one of the greatest eating experience we've ever had in a long time.  This was a completely new experience for us.  Our server, Livingstone made our experience enjoyable. he was attentive, courteous,and entertaining at the same time.  I loved it! it is definitely pricey but considering the quality of meat that they offer at an unlimited portion, it's understandable.  We had to come try the Brazilian restauant, it was well worth it! we'll be returning soon,hopefully!  I will be recommending Texas De Brazil to my family and friends."}
{"text":"It was good. No cookie with my cappuccino and dessert took forever. But meat and salad bar were good."}
{"text":"Great food but the service sucks. We only got 6 meats out of the 16. There is a special table and they got all 16 and the big HD TV . They skipped our table many times. No pork lion nothing just lamb sausage and filet. This was crappy"}
{"text":"What a great place to have dinner . You are catered to like royalty and the food is awesome . Another great place to eat !"}
{"text":"By far the best restaurant experience I've ever had. The service was excellent, the food was delicious, and the ambiance was perfect.   Our server explained how the food was served, offered us some suggestions for food and drink, and before we knew it we had an amazing spread of meats, garlic mashed potatoes, and cheese bread rolls. They also brought us some fried bananas which were AMAZING.  I've never had food like this before, and I almost couldn't keep up with everything because there was just so much to choose from.   The only (tiny) issue I had the whole night was that their sushi rolls were all crab, and I'm allergic. I was told they were delicious, either way.   If you're reading this, EAT AT THIS PLACE. It's expensive, but it's so SO worth every penny. From now on, anytime someone asks for a nice place to eat, I'm telling them to go to Texas De Brazil at Town Square."}
{"text":"If you are craving for meat and wine come to Texas de Brasil! Really nice place!  Delicious food, wide selection of vine!  Come hungry! And grab a buddy!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite place. We like to go there whenever there is somebody's birthday. The meat options are amazing. Especially love the beef rack it's so juicy and delicious. I also love the cheese bread that they have on the table and the sangria. Customer service is great. Can't wait to go for the next birthday."}
{"text":"I go to Texas de Brazil today the food is great delicious im have happy I recommend to eat the"}
{"text":"Listen to other reviews!! The meats are salted the the point of being inedible, and this is coming from a salt lover. This is not limited to one single cut. All 15 or so meats seemed equality destroyed with salt. I'm not sure if this is a tactic to reduce peoples consumption but I've been to other high end Brazil BBQ style restaurants and will NEVER return to this location.  That being said the quality of food and cooking was very good and I was left disappointed to be forced to eat sushi from a salad bar for dinner. The entire party of 6 were equally disappointed. We left feeling slightly robbed after the high cost per plate..."}
{"text":"This place is really good l. Service is certainly excellent. You can get the salad bar or salad bar with meats. Ive had both. The salad bar alone is good enough but if your into meat you definetly will not be disappointed here."}
{"text":"ate here last sunday it was not good. non of the meat tempetures were close to what was presented most overcooked. salad bar average at best. only saving grace the mashed potatoes and the pork ribs. way overpriced definite tourist trap"}
{"text":"This place was recommended from a family friend. Food was great a service was as well. Being a fine dining establishment the wine list is good, but the beer list is terrible. I made a reservation and told the host we were celebrating our anniversary, I felt they did not care. We were to full for dessert, but would have been a nice gesture to give one to say congratulations. I would have rather gone to Mastro's Steakhouse."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Texas De Brazil several times.  My last experience was not so great but I thought I would try it again.  I had purchased a card to help charity and in it also gave me discounted meals.  I read all the things about purchasing the card and what happens if you lose it.  The bottom of the card must have come off and I didn't realize it.  I have punches on the top so I assumed that is where they punched it to give you a discount.  I told the waiter the card is only punched 5 times and I have 7 more punches.  He walks away with my card.  Next thing I know the evening manager is standing in front of me.  My perception of her talking at me was that I was doing something  very wrong and I am stupid for trying it.  I did not like the way she treated me and that is the second encounter I have had with her on two separate occasions. She can't handle anything that is not a smooth transaction.  It makes her turn into a nasty person.  Those cards are all numbered.  The managers have to take all gift card and discount payments.  They run everything through their computer.  You know she could have certainly checked to see I had only used it 5 times.  No matter what she was rude and condescending and worst of all she did not care one bit. I should have learned my lesson the first time she was so dismissive and not gone back."}
{"text":"All I can say is wow! Best steakhouse I've ever eaten at. I ate like a king and got the itis afterwards (if you don't know what the itis is, Google it). I always recommend this place to anyone who wants to eat like a king. The price is kinda high but you will soon forget about it. I should mention though, skip the salad bar and eat all meat varieties. You'll probably end up with the bubble guts like I did if you get too greedy. But who cares? Their bathrooms are nice and clean too!"}
{"text":"The meats are top notch.  My favorites were the  Brazilian Picanha and leg of lamb.  Both were well seasoned, succulent and tender.  The salad bar is very well laid out and has a wide variety of choices.  I thoroughly enjoyed the asparagus, green beans and couscous salad.  My companion and i split one of the cheesecake offerings for dessert.  The cheesecake was exceptional, not the overly sweet stuff shoveled out at Cheesecake factory.   Okay, the service, I note some yelpers have complained about the service. The service we got was just absolutely spot on -- the hostess, our waitress and the guys bringing the meat were all totally professional and could not have made us feel more at home.  We shared a bottle of Chilean wine, the Riberas gran reserva cab sauvignon.  It was excellent.  For meats this good you expect to pay.  I don't understand why some yelpers complain.  The pricing is very upfront.  Sorry whiners, this is not the Texas Road House or Applebees.  I for one am glad it is not."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, a little on the pricey side. I wouldn't recommend taking children under the age of 12. Very nice atmosphere and the customer service was exceptional."}
{"text":"My wife and I try to eat here every time we are in Vegas from our home in San Diego (which is about 4 times a year).  My only complaint is that the food is soooooo good I tend to make myself sick over-eating.  The staff are always friendly and professional.  The atmosphere is very nice (we've made the mistake of coming in wearing tee-shirts; nobody said anything, but I just felt a little under-dressed.  So I make sure to at least wear a decent shirt.)  One helpful tip - be careful of the Lobster Bisque.  The very first time we ate there, I had A LOT of it, as it was so creamy and delicious.  I paid for it later that night.  Now, normally if I had problems of that type, I probably wouldn't go back.  But that just goes to show how much we loved the place.  Upon return visits I just went easy on the Bisque, and no problems.  A few Vegas visits back we were comp'ed 2 dinners to a Brazilian BBQ in Planet Hollywood.  It was terrible.  So stick with the good stuff.  Reservations are a good idea, as they can get busy right when the open the doors (for dinner; don't know about weekend lunch)."}
{"text":"My Brazilian friend and I had been disappointed at another Brazilian restaurant in town and weren't going to give up on our quest to get a decent Brazilian meal here. That we did at Texas de Brazil. It's a huge, beautiful, busy restaurant. You get tons of food, especially meat, barbecued meat, which is what Texas de Brazil is all about. I absolutely loved the Picanha cut of meat, which is a type of sirloin, because it was so tender and moist. Next time I go that's the only meat I will eat...no I think I'll still want to try others, but I will definitely get my fill of that. The salad bar was also excellent, and it was nice to try different Brazilian sides and veggies. But don't make the mistake that I did and fill up on that salad bar. I had little room for my Picanha (try it, you won't regret it). The service was good, and the only downside was that it's very expensive. I know it's all you can eat meat, but still it's expensive. Next time we're going during lunch. Anyway, I really loved the place, and can't wait to go back when my friend has money!"}
{"text":"Yummy! Make sure to come hungry! There is an all you can eat soup and salad bar, but don't fill up on that (I made that mistake). There are waiters walking all over the restaurant with different meat on skewers and they just cut it right then and there for you straight onto your plate. It's an all you can eat restaurant so pace yourself! When I was there, we had to wait at the bar for almost an hour to be seated, and this was with a reservation! Since we were seated so late, the restaurant emptied out a bit and a lot of the waiters with the skewers disappeared.. we had to ask our waiter multiple times to ask for more meat to come around. But then when it did, 3 /4 times it was bacon (and I don't eat bacon). Despite this, we filled up pretty quickly and so towards the end we didn't mind that the waiters weren't coming around anymore."}
{"text":"Starters, the place, atmosphere  was beautiful  and elegant .  The waiter and servers  were  attentive .  Other than some of the  meat being  a little  too  salty  for  my  taste, every meat item had a wonderful  flavor (the   flank steak was about  the only meat  that was tough  ).   The lobster  bisque  was delicious ,  of course  I  was  expecting  to see some type of lobster, Lagostino, or crawfi sh in it, but still delicious .  Salad bar had an assortment  of items. A couple of drawbacks  : it would have been nice if all the selections of meats came out in the beginning .  It seems  like I  rarely  saw the different  chickens come out compared  to the frequency of some of the other different  steaks. Also it was not until much later did I  see the lamb  chops and bbq pork ribs come out...by that  time  I  was  too full  to try. I wish  all  meat items came out  around the same  time. Also, the potatoes  that are placed on the table ,  I  believe  they  were  garlic  potatoes ,  were  also  too salty ; thank  goodness  for  the  au gratin potatoes  which  were delicious .  I will  definitely  recommend  this  place ."}
{"text":"I can't even express how much I enjoyed it here. The service is stellar, the salad bar amazing! Omg the meats are beyond awesome. I could come here every night! Best meal ever!"}
{"text":"Meat lovers fantasy. The salad bar way more than just salad. Good staff and fun place to eat. The house steaks was my favorite and the ribs were good too."}
{"text":"Great place for a get together with friends and family. The salad bar is excellent, fresh well cooked and full of flavor. The meats were all excellent, savory and just the right hint of salt. Ask for what you want, don't be shy. The thing that sets this one apart is the service. They are attentive and thoughtful, both the gauchos, servers and management. To top it off the papaya cream shut it down! Obrigado a Texas de Brasil!  Fast, go and gorge, YOLO!  Haha not many times to truly use that phrase but here is one."}
{"text":"Excellent! Awesome! Great food! Service on point!!!!!!!!!! Highly recomended!!!!!!!! The accommodations they went through for my baby girls wedding reception!!! Nothing but a big Thank you!!!!"}
{"text":"First time there.  Everything was awesome from start to finish.  Great choice at the salad bar and an assortment of meats to choose from... all seasoned and prepared very well.  Adam was our waiter... he was excellent... the place hummed.  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Some of the best steaks I've had, and that is coming from a Texan. Worth a vist if you are looking for a plave with variety and drinks. Great for get togethers and parties. Make sure you save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"It doesn't compare to Green Forest.  No free refills on soda is probably my biggest pet peeve in the restaurant business. You ask for a coke, and they bring you a tiny bottle. When I pay this amount of money, I expect certain things. Free refills is one of them.  The food. It wasn't wonderful. Most of it was over cooked. Every slice we got was medium well, grey, and not at all juicy. Our waitress seemed like she was bothered when I asked her to have certain cuts of meat come back around. I wouldn't of had to ask her that, if the staff that carried the meat wouldn't of skipped our table most of the time.  It was happy hour when I went. They had a sign outside of the restaurant telling me so. So when I asked for a drink, the waitress said, \"sorry thats only at the bar\". I said ok, can I go get a drink at the bar and bring it back here? She said no. I mean really?!   The Green Forest was a much better experience. It had more cuts of meat, at a better cook temp. They offer free refills on soda, the wait staff was much better at the Green Forest too.    Don't believe the hype. Go to Green Forest, you will be happier"}
{"text":"The food is Okay but it's not worth 44.00 dollars a plate.  I feel it's way overpriced for the quality of meats."}
{"text":"You destroyed my 50th birthday last year...the food was ok, but your service was horrible...and you did little to fix it. Thank God I went elsewhere this year...I will never return. My suggestion to all...if you have kids or a party less than 3 go elsewhere...you are not considered worthy. The servers are too worried about their tip...I mean big parties. Two things to watch for...pop/sodas are served in little bottles and are expensive...they add up. Second, if you have young kids they may qualify for a special rate. Make sure they are charging you correctly."}
{"text":"Love this place. Love the lobster soup.  Great atmosphere. Nice staff. I liked the sangria. Espresso was amazing! Strong and creamy! Perfection!"}
{"text":"I have had the finest dining experience here time and time again, waiters are so friendly and attentive, food is delicious, as soon as you take a drink they are already refilling your cup. This is the definition of 5 star service."}
{"text":"Was very great food. First time visit. New Year's Eve dinne  And I told  myself it was heaven. Love the steak. But not until they served me one of their meat, the fillet mignon that i got was too bad meat, taste like a rat.  And smell horrible, it is old meat. After I ate that bad meat, I now keep smelling all the meat in my plate. And of course lost the appetite. Told  them to smell it and taste it but they didn't do nothing. Maybe bec they don't wanna agreed that they had a bad meat. Manager didnt believed that as well of course.. was very disappointed after they do nothing. Still paying full bill and tip good.. very disappointed. Not coming back no more. Even thought I fell like heaven at first."}
{"text":"We went to dinner here with a large party. Service was excellent! They were very attentive and everyone had a great time. Now the food.... Wow! Everyone had at least two favorite things that they went crazy for. I absolutely love the bacon wrapped chicken and the filet minion. The quality of the food is great and they offer pretty good deserts too.  If you are not a meat eater no problem because the salad bar is excellent as well. We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Another fabulous dinner. Great service. I don't even utilize the outstanding salad bar. I do love the potatoes au gratin and lobster bisque."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Went there today for a business lunch meeting. Service and food was five stars!! Definitely would recommend this place to everyone. Great job!!!"}
{"text":"First timers and cannot wait to go back again! A Brazilian steakhouse with a Texas spin... Service was extremely attentive from the hostess, our server, to the meat carvers! Recommend for going for lunch on the weekend, as non-alcoholic drinks & dessert are included in the $49.99 price! Also, if you are military, you receive 20% off your bill for a party up to 8 people! You're given a circular card, green side up means bring me more while red side up means give me a break. Being first timers, our server named Meagan did an excellent job of explaining everything so thoroughly! That alone justified a 20% tip!   The salad bar is quite extensive with 50 items. For $29.99 you can actually skip the meat and just fill up in the salad bar! But it's a steakhouse, so what's the point? Lol. It had a wide variety, including traditional salad items but also things like quinoa salad, shrimp salad, artichoke salad, mushroom salad -- basically a big range of different cold ones! Across from that, there is a warm selection of side dishes. The soup of the day was lobster bisque, which had a rich & tangy flavor. There were also potatoes au gratin, sautéed mushrooms (I got two servings of both of these! So good!), black beans, and white jasmine rice. The server also brings out a side dish of mashed potatoes, sweetened plantains and cheese filled knots of bread -- which I struggled not to fill up on! I had to keep reminding myself we were there to eat steak!   We were seated at the entrance of the kitchen so service from the men walking around with giant skewers of meat with large carving knives was amazing. If our cards were flipped up green, we were swarmed by them offering us different types ranging beef, lamb, pork, chicken, and sausage. Every single thing was seasoned & cooked to perfection... many cooked with the option of medium rare or well done. I personally did not try any of the pork/sausage, so I cannot give an opinion. I particularly did not like the chicken, as I found them to be dry. The lamb was dry as well, but extremely flavorful that I did not mind! Our personal favorites were the beef brisket (OMG, to die for! So incredibly good!), filet mignon & flank steak. Delicious!   Once we were finished, our server brought out a tray of desserts for us to choose from... but obviously we were stuffed & didn't leave room. She offered to box it up and let us take it home, which was very nice of her! We took home the double chocolate mousse & the banana foster. Both rich & perfectly sweet. And much more enjoyed since we didn't have to force ourselves to consume it before leaving. This seriously just adds to making this dining experience even better!  Will we return? Absolutely! Not a single complaint here! Five stars, nothing less. :)"}
{"text":"Good food, great service! I would have liked the hostess to have been more polite and write my phone number right we could have been seated a half hour earlier and she didn't care! But after being seated everything was great!!! They even wrote happy birthday on my husband's dessert plate!! Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful venue... terrific service... LOVED the caipirinha cocktail... sensational salad/side dish bar. The meats, however were salty to the point of being inedible. In their defense, they scrambled to correct it when informed but the \"lighter salt\" version was still too salty. My guess is the cook was having a bad night and this likely will be corrected given the staffs' willingness to please.  I'll give them another chance in the near future. I hope they fix this... a major flaw at an otherwise terrific restaurant."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. Absolutely anazing!!! I will more than dedanitly be coming back here. I haven't eaten this much in i don't know how long. The meat is so soft and flavor full. Super nice and polite workers. If you want a nice filling meal then come here."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Couldn't cone up with a bad thing to say if I tried. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Delicious salad bar with super fresh greens, cheeses, prosciutto, prepared veggies and fruits. The fresh grilled meats were served endlessly, each one better than the the next!! The staff were very helpful and courteous. You definitely will not be hungry when you leave here!!"}
{"text":"Celebrated my 21st birthday! Server was amazing.  His name was J, was very tentative and was always ready to answer any questions! The food was beyond breath taking. Love the lamb chops. Everything was just delicious. Worth the price. Was suprise with a banana foster as a birthday gift by the server.   Will be back! :)"}
{"text":"Great food and service. The salad bar was great but the meat is what you go for. Meat sweats for days!"}
{"text":"We've been here before, our dinner tonight was good! Service was attentive. Salad bar was neat and clean. Complimentary dessert for anniversary, not bad at all!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a meat lover's dream!!  The aroma of delicious steak is alluring the minute you walk through the door and it's quite intoxicating.     Ambiance is a little upscale and so inviting.    The salad bar is quite majestic and so many options to choose from scalloped potatoes, real/crispy bacon slices, soup, asparagus, variety of cheese, shrimp, etc.  Just ordering the salad bar as your meal would suffice.  My date and I turned over our disks on our table to the \"green\" side (to indicate that we are ready to be served) the once the skewers of the delicious grilled carved meat starting coming .. the experience began!    Filet Mignon wrapped in bacon, Brazilian Sausage, Parmesan crusted pork loin etc.    Our waitress did state to \"pace yourself\" but that was difficult to do because once you started to taste one selection - another one would arrive.   I had a tough time turning my little disk on our table to the \"red\" side -which halted any new meat from arriving.  We received two sides - garlic mashed potatoes and sweet grilled bananas (which are supposed to cleanse your pallet).  The mashed potatoes were tasty but the garlic was a bit too strong for my taste. The grilled bananas were different.        The restaurant was busy and seemed as if our waitress was overwhelmed it took a little while for our drinks to arrive.  Our water goblets were not refilled either.   This was a great experience and I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service! Highly Recomend this restaurant Just make sure you come with a big appetite!  The servers are all wonderful and the selection of meat and salad bar is exceptional!"}
{"text":"Texas de Brazil is amazing your first time then kind of just plateaus at really good to good. Nothing will beat the first time you eat here, it's like nothing you've ever seen before. Endless meat, a decent salad bar and oh yeah did I mention endless meat?  The taste of meat is inconsistent. For example we went last night and the meat was medium rare and tasted amazing. The time before the meat was more well done and extremely salty. I personally prefer the medium rare and less salt. They do allow you to choose the desired temperature and will bring it out to you separately.   At $45/ plate it seems fair. They are very attentive to your needs and almost swarm you with all varieties of meat during your entire dining experience which is exactly what you want at a place like this. I recommend getting on the mailing list for deals and specials, that is usually the only time I will go because it will make a good experience great when you know you are only paying half price!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for special occasions! The salad bar is amazing and comes with lobster bisque which is a huge plus in my book. The bacon wrapped filet and sausage were probably my favorite meats that I tried. I am also a huge fan of the fact that Texas de Brazil gives free desserts for birthdays, anniversarys, etc. The meat can be a little salty at times, hence the four stars instead of five. If you're planning a trip here, it's best to eat very light before so that you are hungry enough to reap its benefits!"}
{"text":"Not all 'All You Can Eats' are equal.. I had a small salad then devoured about 3-4 lbs of lamb(leg and chops). Both were incredible, service was excellent and price was great. Would return for sure"}
{"text":"Terrible brief experience. Restaurant was pretty empty. Music was blaring. Manager wasn't lowering it. Asked to see manager several times to no avail. While waiting for manager a mouse ran by several times.  We walked out and passed the manager on our way out. Can't imagine if it were busy. Also assumed that mouse was headed to the buffet!!!"}
{"text":"I have to starve before going because I always eat way too much.  It's a great place to experience different protein that I wouldn't otherwise get to try.  I love the Sangria too."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant with exotic meats and a dope salad bar! First time being to this kind of place and it was fun, you have a card that you flip to green to keep the meats coming and red to stop, but who would wanna stop putting delicious meats in their mouths?! Not me that's for sure! This place was lit! I ate here for my birthday with my family and boyfriend, now fiancé, who proposed to me during dinner here and I couldn't ask for anything better than this incredible, handsome, funny, athletic man, except for maybe this restaurant's bacon wrapped meat...haha just kidding! But forreal, the food here was great and this man's even better, glad to be able to call him mine."}
{"text":"What can I say, this place is so good! Our server was A-1. So attentive, recommending and explaining for us first timers! My SO started with a glass of Pinot & I had the signature drink, a lime caipirhina. When in Rome! We meandered over to the salad bar with over 60 items. Now this is no typical salad bar. It had artichoke hearts, asparagus, couscous, tabouli, just to name a few items. Quality, first rate items. We had a good time tasting all the different selections of meat. My favorite was the lamb chops. Pace yourself; there is a lot to try. Don't get filled up on the salad bar if you can control yourself! The fried bananas were yummy. We ended the evening with a cappuccino & flan. A most enjoyable evening."}
{"text":"I do not always give a place 5 stars because I know there is always room to improve, but this place lived up to its reputation; yes, it is pretty steep for about $50 a person for the average person, but definitely worth the price. The salad bar alone is amazing; I was worried about getting full before the meat started to arrive, with some great choices; just avoid the Tabbouleh; I do not know what a Lebanese salad is doing there but it is not close to the real thing. Everything else is great; it is a meat heaven for meat lovers with just about anything you can think of that can be served on a skewer. Place is very classy too, great for a date or even a business meeting; just make sure everybody shows up for the reservation because they will not seat you until the whole party is there, which is now understandable as they try to make use of every chair because of how busy they are, and it was on a Wednesday!"}
{"text":"This review is for our recent visit on 2/11/17. We decided to beat the Valentine's Day rush on Tuesday and celebrate early. First off, so glad we had reservations as the wait times were being quoted 1+ hour for walk-ins! Secondly, service was spot on despite the restaurant being very busy! All the staff were working together to ensure that the patrons were taken care of. Even the managers were bussing tables and making up tables. Lastly, the food ~ seasoned very well, salad bar was replenished regularly and special mention for the lamb chops which were cooked very well. Definitely one of our top favorite restaurants! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Very poor Service from Manager \"Jose Garcia\".  04/21/2016 / 7pm POOOOOR Management Service Adventure!  First: I was an often recurring guest. I'm a member of three VIP Dining Cards just know and I brought any time new guests to this restaurant. Also this time.  We were 6 Person. 4 of us had a VIP card with 50% Discount (we paid for this VIP cards: $180). The another two Persons (brand new guests) had no VIP Card. They had a 10% coupon direct from Texas de Brazil.  The Manager don't accept the 10% discount for the another first coming brand new two guests.   Declaration by the Manager: We can not combine two offers.  My answer was: We don't combine two offers. 4 guests pay with the 50% VIP card and the another two new guest pay seperately with the 10% discount offer from your restaurant. Manager: No, you sit on the same table!  Result: We gave $0 Tip and this restaurant lost at this moment 2 brand new returning guests and we will eat no longer there also. We change the Brazilian Steak house here in Vegas to: \"Fogo de Chao\" with a better customer service. Congratulation Manager Jose Garcia for this success. I never bring new guests to you restaurant and we spend no more money in your restaurant."}
{"text":"Good food but...  To long to get a bottle of wine and they never have the right year they sold, ordered 2012 I get 2015 then 2011 and get 2014... at the same price ?! Weird."}
{"text":"This place was amazing.  So many different meats to choose from and they are all really good.... well at least all the ones I tried.   Next time, I'm gonna stay away from the side bar until I've tried all of the meats."}
{"text":"So glad to be a Las Vegas local so we can enjoy the cuisine, servers and amazing menu at this location anytime!!!  Definitely one of the best Brazilian steakhouses around. Convenient location at Town Square with plenty of parking. Kudos to the great Manager on Duty this evening, Jose -  we really appreciated your hospitality and look forward to returning SOON! #PanDeQueso"}
{"text":"We love this restaurant. It's always a must when we're in Vegas. The food and service are excellent. The salad bar is simply exquisite, from the cheeses to various salad selection and lobster bisque, it's all really great. Plus the mashed potatoes and platano they serve your table are so stinkin good, it's really tough to save room for the meat but somehow I manage lol. My absolute favorite are the lamb chops. I never even really liked lamb until this place. After dipping the perfectly marinated & roasted meat in their mint jelly, it's like eating candy or better yet, maybe manna. It's that good. The house sirloin is our other favorite followed by the flank steak. Aside from the food, all of the servers are excellent & Douglas is our favorite."}
{"text":"I came out to Vegas in January '15 and was told this was the last meal we would go to less I want to end up in a food coma prior to hitting all the activities. It did not disappoint. Servers with endless cuts of savory meats, all indicated with the flip of a small chip on your table: green means go and red means I've had enough. Not to mention you can fill up on the salad bar alone, if you're not carnivorous try the red quinoa salad. Safe to say, come here with an appetite and plan for a nap afterwards."}
{"text":"I have longed to try a Brazilian Steakhouse for many years and have always wanted to go to Brasa but the timing was never right and the price was certainly never right. Don't misunderstand me, I am not cheap, but wanting a romantic night out with the wife, the time off, adding the cost of dinner alone then someone to sit for the kids... it can break the bank of a not-so-well-off man LOL  Anyway, we noticed this place the last time we drove through Crocker Park, I looked them up, saw they had some deals that lent slightly more towards my budget and I gave them a ring, made a reservation through Open Table and on the night of our anniversary we went.  The Ambiance was lovely, the hostess, whom also happened to be the manager, was delightful every moment of our conversation, and our primary waiter was awesome. He was very helpful and not pushy about the Wine selection. We picked one of the cheaper wines in the list and he made us feel like we'd picked pure gold.   Each server on the meat spits (Guachos?) was pleasant, quick, and offered their hints as to how they liked the meats and were quite kind and courteous if we passed on a meat choice.   If you go on weekend afternoons you can shave $15 off of your meal, per person. They have specials run when you sign up on the site, and for anniversary dinners they offer a complimentary dessert for each of you or a champagne toast. We went with the dessert. All told, through the complimentary dessert and the $20 off coupon we had we probably saved about $40-45 which we funneled back into the wine and we tipped based on what the price WOULD have been (as you should do). We had a very good time and will be back again.  Now for my only Complaint. I have heard legendary things about the salad bars at Brazilian Steakhouses and this just didn't measure up. Don't laugh at me... I LOVE the salad bar at Ruby Tuesdays. Never had a better salad bar... so I was expecting something like That mixed with what we had. Do not get me wrong, it was very interesting items, but I could not see spending $25-30 just to have that as some do. I'd been under the impression there would be more seafood options and the shrimp dish they had was not appealing to me.  Lobster Bisque... OMG - If i could have taken a gallon of that home... yes yes.  Anyway... VERY VERY Good... I recommend."}
{"text":"Not a meat eater and found everything too much items to enjoy including the smoked Salmon from their bar just phenomenal! The little red peppers are too real good and just thinking about the smash potatoes and fried plantains makes my mouth water.Really the best place to enjoy with families. I am coming back and back and back until the ends of time. Go. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants! My boyfriend and I absolutely ADORE Texas De Brazil.   We first came here for our anniversary after getting a recommendation from my older brother. A lot of our mutual friends agreed that this place was the bomb diggity.   The wait staff is VERY attentive. They fold your napkins when you are away from the table and are SUPER on top of drinks. All the food is delicious and there really isn't anything to complain about.   TIPS AND TRICKS:   I would suggest going to lunch rather than dinner. Dinner price is 50 dollars and lunch is 30. The only difference is that lunch doesn't include sushi, heart of palm, and buffalo mozzarella at the salad bar. I love the heart of palm and mozzarella but I'd rather have a cheaper bill.   Lunch is also a lot more laid back than dinner. Not that fancy is a bad thing! It's just what you are in the mood for that day, I suppose.   My favourites include the fried bananas, lamb chops, and Brazilian sodas.  I would also suggest getting a dessert, specifically the cheesecake. While it's not included in the meal, it's definitely worth the extra charge. And if you get the lunch with a desert, it's still cheaper than the dinner charge! ;D  ALSO! MAKE A RESERVATION. THIS PLACE GETS PRETTY PACKED."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant and fun spot with good energy.  The salad bar was lovely with lots of salads and cheeses and olives.  My favorite was the lobster bisque which was found at the salad bar.  That was by far the most delicious thing.    We sampled many of the meats and while most were good, none were exceptional.   That was disappointing considering the price.    We did really enjoy the mashed potatoes and fried plantains that were served."}
{"text":"Meat. You will explode from the meat. The staff remembered my preferences and were outgoing. My mom was in a terrible mood and they managed to cheer her up, please tip accordingly when dining with grumpy people."}
{"text":"We dined here on Thursday and I had absolutely no complaints about Texas de Brazil. We had reservations for 8 o'clock and we waited about five minutes to be seated. As far as everything else from the service to the food, it was all great!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big meat person but this place made me change my mind! I had just about every meat they offered and everything was amazing! All the food was flavorful and the meat was tender. The Filet Mignon was by far my favorite."}
{"text":"Went there with my dad and friends of ours for a night out. Food was good like normal, but still not like others I have had. Everything is fine until some guy that looked like Lex Luthor's second cousin \"the manager\" said we couldn't use a $25 voucher that we received FROM THEM for my birthday, because we already used one at the table. I think it's funny, because WE DIDN'T USE ONE YET. He didn't feel like putting it in and didn't care at all. Then, he proceeded to follow us to the front of the restaurant like a creep. Before you go, take this review in consideration. Thank You"}
{"text":"Lived up to its reputation. Great food and great service. Highly recommend! Very good for small or large groups."}
{"text":"The first time we ate at this location was Christmas Eve 2016.  10.0 ratings all around.  That is the reason why we decided to go back again for our friends' bday threat over the weekend.  This time, meat wasn't as tasty and tender as the first time we went there.  On the salad bar, the fish dish was excellent, but never refilled.  Our server was excellent tho.    Overall, 3 stars for our dinner last Saturday."}
{"text":"Disappointing! I have been to several Brazilian steakhouses before and this by far is the worst. The food (although I can't judge too much of the food since they only brought us filet, and flank steak over and over again!)and the service were horrible.  We had reservations and arrived early. The restaurant was half empty but we still had to wait 1 hour to be seated, as the rude hostess stated \" We will not seat you before your reservation time\"..really?! There were plenty of empty tables!  Once we finally sat down, all they brought over was fillet and flank steak over , and over, and over, again. No lamb, no chicken, no pork, none of their\"signature meats\". Definitely not worth it...there are plenty other restaurants of this type to try."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed at this restaurant.  The service is horrible.  When they asked if we had been there before I mentioned that I had not, but I knew how Brazilian churrascaria's worked because I've been to Green Forest.  He looked at me like I was an idiot and had no idea what I was talking about. Come on, the only other Brazilian restaurant in Pittsburgh and you've never heard of it?   What brings people to these kinds of restaurants is the meat.  The servers that brought the meat came in waves.  You'd have three or four come by at once, then you'd be sitting there for an extremely long time looking around trying to get someone to come fill your plate.    We came during restaurant week, but only about half of the restaurant was filled, so there should be no excuse for the horrible service.  When we were finished eating, we sat around for a very long time before we were able to get our server's attention to get our bill.  And we were not the only ones sitting around twiddling our thumbs.    The quality of the meats and salad bar food was good, and was the only thing that redeems this restaurant."}
{"text":"Was kind of dissappointed here. Not as good as the other brazilians ive been to. Was a little to salty. Still good though."}
{"text":"I give it 5 stars just for our waiter Matt D. He is so good at his job. We come in often and have actually made friends with him. We are VERY sad to find out he has moved behind the bar. But he is fantastic and hope this move works out for him. The restaurant is always on point though! I recommend it to all my friends over all other Brazilian steak houses!!"}
{"text":"Amazing !!!! I can't rave enough about this place ...I'm only disappointed there isn't one back home in Los Angeles. We have a pretty popular churrascaria here but I can honestly say I prefer Texas de Brazil. The choices are bountiful and not to mention delishes. The Feijoada is always perfect and their plantains are just heaven sent. I don't even like my own cooked plantains anymore because Texas de Brazil ruined that for me lol.  Plus don't get me started on the Pão de queijo (cheese bread aka small puff balls of pure bliss in your mouth).....without sounding like a complete pig ...anymore.....I would gladly share them with you if we were sitting at the table together ...they bring more if you run out :) oh happy day, more Carbs!!!    Point of my yelp is....... just DO IT.... GO BIG.... or go home!  I know real Brazilian Churrascaria and this place is incrível!!!!"}
{"text":"My five stars goes to our Awesome Waiter/Server CARLOS S ...... And yes we remembered his name because people like him, you never forget!! Made our first experience one to remember. He was very attentive! The restaurant has a wide selection of meats and salad bar with other sides (rice, mushrooms, potatoes) When coming here make sure to pace yourself in order to be able to appreciate all the food the restaurant has to offer."}
{"text":"It definitely was an experience. I think Hawaii peeps should try this at least once. Lots and lots of meats. So much that I got exhausted eating meat if possible. I kept on trying but I finally had to tap out. Worth the money? Not really but to say I did it was what I wanted to accomplish. BOOOM!"}
{"text":"Holy cow.  No pun intended.  We ate so much and tried to keep it going.  Ugh.  Salad is amazing and I should have stopped there. ... But I didn't.  Filet was my favorite with the sausage a close second.  The flank steak was seasoned excellent. I finished with cheesecake and a coffee then I raced home to relax and reflect on my accomplishments.  I will go back and try to eat just the salad bar.   Maybe."}
{"text":"Good brazilian steakhouse, average pricing tho. I recommend it to a friend. I'll definitely get back there!"}
{"text":"Everything was great!! First time here celebrating our wedding anniversary. VERY friendly staff all which worked very well together. The carvers all were excellent with tableside manners and being all over the service. The Manager Craig was all over it, ensuring all the guests were.well taken care of. Restroom was spotless as well. Finished the specatcular evening with 3 of their desserts!!"}
{"text":"I love churrasco.  I love this place.  The problem I always have is that I tend to fill up on the salad bar (a misnomer if ever there was one) before the carnivore kicks in.  The salad bar is more an antipasti bar: salumi, cheeses, roasted and pickled vegetables, and a lobster bisque that will have you wanting it IV.  Oh, and there are salads as well.  The meats are roasted perfectly, and there's plenty to go around.  I am a fan of lamb, and when they come out with not only roast leg but also chops, I'm in heaven.  I just wish I (or I'm glad I don't) live closer.  It's in the Town Square, and I live in Sunrise Manor, so it's a 45 minute drive; but it's well worth the drive."}
{"text":"I have been to Brazilian restaurants at least a hundred times during my lifetime I am a real fan. This is my first time to this restaurant and I have to say that this restaurant sets the bar extremely high for others, from the food to the Ambiance to the service was excellent and nothing short of excellent."}
{"text":"I love love love the salad bar here, the meats are excellent quality and don't have that gamey taste some Brazilian steakhouses have. But service is always spotty, the drinks are usually not well-made, and they really need to make sure the cheesebread is fresh. These complaints are only due to having been here four times now and continuously having the same little issues. Unsure at this point if we want to come back or just go to a great steakhouse where you order one steak and your meal is cooked perfectly to order....the cost would be the same. This place would be a bargain if you eat tons of protein, which I don't."}
{"text":"Can't come to Vegas without making this one our dinner stops.  The food is always on point with something for everyone! They will cook the meat to your liking if you like it a little more rare or even on the burnt side.  Staff is friendly and professional.  There will definately be a crowd and a wait on a Friday or Saturday night but it is worth the wait, no matter how long it is.  Just go to the bar and grab a specialty cocktail while you wait!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in years before this past weekend, so I thought it was the perfect time to write a review. The dinner was is $49.99. The salad bar was kind of disappointing and they don't have as many you my options as they did during my last visit. The cheesy type potatoes on the far wall were delicious and the sushi wasn't bad. It said it was spicy crab but it wasn't spicy at all.   When you're ready for meat, flip the little card to green. When you're full, flip it to red and they will stop coming to your table. Super simple! The filet mignon was my favorite and had the best flavor. It was salty but I liked it because it gave it so much flavor. My favorite thing at dinner was the little rolls they bring out. I forgot all about them until I saw the little basket. They are still my favorite after all of these years. The mashed potatoes and banana they bring out are also delicious. I wait until the end of dinner to eat some of the banana because it's super sweet.   If there's something you're looking for but the guys aren't bringing it to your table, ask. They usually ask you but just in case, you can request items to come to your table."}
{"text":"Meat metropolis, carnivorous conundrum, however I describe it you'll still have to experience it to understand it for yourself.  If my visit to Tin Front Cafe was my earth friendly food decision (see my review of them, awesome place) then this was my f*ck all the animals food decision.  Did I feel bad?  When you taste the marinated, sea salt infused lamb chop you might not feel bad either, but let's not get ahead of ourselves cause surprisingly there's more than MEATS the eye here.  Located in Station Square in Pittsburgh PA this protein playground is surprisingly low key and you'd drive right past thinking it wasn't much.  As soon as you walk through the front door though, you realize you've walked into the belly of the meat beast.  I couldn't help but admire that everyone in the place was happy and not a seat was empty.  While we waited me and my other 5 friends made our way to the bar.  I had the signature drink the Caipirinha (meaning little peasant) a Brazilian drink along the lines of a Mojito but a little more sweet than minty.  At $9 it was a small drink but that's to be expected at a place like this.  I will say I think it was great, and worth a try at least once.  Our table was finally ready.  We had the option of heading to the large and impressively fresh salad bar before we began our meatscapade and there's way more than lettuce on there.  Sushi, lobster bisque, potatos, fresh pastrami and hunks of cheese and bread and crackers populate it.  For $25 you can get just that and you could have a pretty good meal with just that, but that's not why you came.  After a sample of the salad bar the main course got underway.    They give you a small circle card that is red on one side and green on the other.  Green means go, red means please stop I'm so full I'm gonna explode.  Makes sense? Good lets eat meat.  Try a tablespoon of mashed potatoes and maybe one roll but save all the room for various cuts of seasoned beef, lamb, pork, chicken, and brazilian sausage cut fresh straight to your plate.  The lamb chops and the parmesan encrusted pork stood out to me.  All the steaks were flawless and can be cooked however you like them.  The sausage was smokey and delicious and the chicken melted right off the bone.  Make it a mission of yours to eat every meat at least once.  They can carve off just a sliver or a huge slice so you can portion your sampling out based on your stomach size.  They give you these sugar and cinnamon fried bananas to cleanse your pallet between meats and I ate essentially a whole bundle of bananas as part of my meal in memory of Haramba and because they are f*cking delicious.    At $45 a person some people think this is a bit pricey ($70 after a drink and a tip/per person) but you could easily eat $100 in meat and with that being said, it's pricey but for good reason.  It's not cheap and it only borders expensive for what you get.  This isn't something you would probably do every weekend but every 3 months I could see myself treating myself to this meat masquerade.  I waited a year to go and I can safely say it was worth the wait and actually made me wish I went sooner.    Go with a group for a special trip, this is a great place to watch each member of your party slowly tap out and turn their cards to red.    apreciar! (Portuguese for Enjoy!)"}
{"text":"We had a terrific meal! There was a constant flow of meat! Top sirloin was our favorite! The ladies would have liked just getting the salad bar - there were plenty of filling treats there! Salmon and shrimp, cheese, rice and soup - plus lots of veggies! My only criticism is that the food was a little salty."}
{"text":"Always good for a special occasion or just a meat filled evening. A step above casual but you get a good deal of tourists.  Nice vibes in a good atmosphere,  a little loud at times but comfortable all the same. Bring your appetite as its more than just a salad bar! Make reservations for sure."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with customer service that was provided. I waited for 45 minutes to he seated even with having a reservation. When I complained to customer relations I was told that based on their computer I was seated within about 20 min which was not true. I had to go up several times to ask how much longer because everyone was being seated before us and we kept being told we were next. I have never been so disappointed with service!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is totally worth $50 a person. Every time I go, I make sure I'm hungry...meaning I usually skip breakfast and lunch. Their salad bar has good options for sides, the mashed potatoes and banana dish to serve are so amazing. I'm big on customer service and they are always overly accommodating and welcoming, one of the main reasons I always return. Obviously because of price, it is definitely a place I save for special occassions. But I have never had an issue with the food. Every meat I've had is perfectly cooked and seasoned, it's an easy place to overeat"}
{"text":"One star for service, five stars for the food. We booked a private room for our wedding dinner. We are locals and had people from work, friends, and family from the east coast join us. The food was very good but the service was not. When they started to come around with meats, my husband had to chase down a server for plates. We were a large party and were starving by the time we arrived here so it was a bit embarrassing for me to have all these people from out of town (14 friends and family) sitting there drooling while the meat passed us by. That's what we came for! Then it took forever for our drinks to arrive. They also told us that 15 meats would be served and we maybe got a choice of 5. Then my aunt told me she was waiting for the bacon wrapped chicken and house sirloin and they only served half of the table and never offered any to the other end. I was expecting better service for an $800 bill and a private room!! Not happy at all."}
{"text":"This is, by far, my favorite restaurant...who am I kidding, it's my favorite PLACE, restaurant or otherwise!! I can't even tell you how many times I've been here. Usually, in March, they offer a VIP dining card, which is $60 for 12 meals at half off. Although I passed this year, it's still worth the full price.  This is my wife's and my go-to place for special occasions. We had our first date at TdB. The Event Manager, Monique, and one of the GM's helped me plan my extravagant marriage proposal at TdB. And now, my wife and I returned after our wedding a couple weeks ago. They always treat us great, and the food is phenomenal.  I could go on about the food for days, but the experience can be neatly summarized as an all-you-can-eat, gourmet meat buffet that comes to you! Whether you like filet mignon, sirloin, flank, or ribs, ir pork, or lamb, or sausage...TdB is a meat-eater's heaven on Earth. Don't forget the incredible salad bar, the best in town (everything from prosciutto, to sushi, to palm hearts and cous cous, lobster bisque, shrimp...the list goes on). Careful though...don't pull the rookie mistake of filling up on the salad bar...or the delicious cheesy bread balls at the table. Save room for lots of fried bananas with cinnamon and sugar (free at the table), and the dessert options are insanely good too.  Thank you, TdB, for always providing everything I could ever want in a meal!"}
{"text":"Great steakhouse with an amazing selection of meats.  Buffet is great, service was awesome - we were never left wanting."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go! The salad bar is amazing and the meats are delicious. The best server there by far is Jay! He is very attentive, patient, and polite. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Pro Tip: if you ask for the servers to send you the man with the fillet, they will, and then you can really get your money's worth. Don't fill up on salad bar (although it's so easy to do) and don't fill up on bacon-wrapped chicken and flank steak (although both are delicious). When they guys come around with the really good cuts, like tenderloin, load up on that.  Great meats, a great atmosphere, great sides, and a huge salad bar. I love coming here, I just wish I was rich so I could do it more often. Even though it's pricey, I still feel like I always get what I payed for.   The salad bar, by the way, is not limited to just salads. It also contained smoked salmon, various cured meats, and sushi. It's extremely easy to fill up on just the salad bar -- if that's what you're into, or you just want to save money, they also offer a salad-bar-only menu option. I've considered doing it, but never gone through with it. The siren song of those steaks and roasts is just too much for me."}
{"text":"Unfortunately we were put in a corner table in the back next to a servers table and the meat service was absolutely terrible.  There was two servers (chicken and sausage) that would check on us but all the other servers bringing around all the beef, lamb, and pork meats that we read about here on help were non existent, they just ignored us probably because of the table we were seated at.  It is very obvious they have a routine route down and our table was not part of their routine.  We even attempted to yell and get their attention, however, the restaurant was very loud so we assumed they could not hear us.  The salad bar was good, but I assure you it is not worth $50 per person.  I have no doubt the restaurant is good based on its reviews, unfortunately my wife and I did not get the opportunity to experience the meats that you pay for due to inattentive servers and seating location."}
{"text":"We visited with 5 guests. They have by far the best \"salad / appetizer bar\" of any Brazilian steakhouse I've been to. The food was fresh and everything was very tasty. They had a spicy shrimp which was delicious. My four out of five stars stands for our server seems extremely nervous and kept stumbling over her words ect. She also seemed a bit lost on certain questions we asked. But she was very friendly and nice. Also a few of the meats had an interesting flavor to them. I hadn't experienced that at other Brazilian steakhouses and maybe it's the true \" Brazilian \" flavor but I didn't love it. The atmosphere was very clean and well kept. The bread they bring you was really good and the sangria was fantastic! I will 100% go back and try it again tho, even for the few meats I enjoyed and the great appetizer bar! We also all got desserts and enjoyed them!"}
{"text":"We decided to forgo the Alehouse and head to Texas de Brazil (TdB). It was for my daughter's 21st birthday. Please be sure that you make reservations or you will be waiting for quite some time. This is no fault of TdB. The restaurant is absolutely beautiful inside. They have a full buffet if you are a vegetarian, but are dining with omini's. The food was extremely delicious from the buffet. From what my kids said the meat was tasty and plentiful. My daughter enjoyed the lobster bisque and my son like the selection on the salad bar. Although I didn't eat any meat the Chimichurri sauce was bomb - had it with the rice and mushroom gravy.Our waiter was a joy and we received a complimentary dessert because of the birthday. I often rate an eatery by the cleanliness of their restroom and their restroom was not only clean it was well appointed. Thank you TdB for making my daughter's birthday a great experience."}
{"text":"If you like Brazillian BBQ or a fan of meat, then this is a great place.  Brazillian BBQ, all kinds of meat (beef, pork, chicken, lamb) circulating around the tables with waiters offering all you can eat, freshly cooked or grilled.  Offerings are of different cooking degrees (well, medium, rare).  Delicious salad bar and side dishes offered.  Not cheap, but the dishes are all delicious and all you can eat.  Definitely a treat if you are a fan of good meat dishes.  The side dishes are so good you need to be careful to save room for the meat!"}
{"text":"The beef ribs are one of the best things I've ever eaten. The salad bar is huge with so much to choose from - much more extensive than your average salad bar. The lobster bisque is amazing. All the meat is fresh & delicious. It's worth the money!  The service was also fantastic - the manager was very friendly and made sure we had everything we needed."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming to this restaurant and all I can say is that it's amazing. The minute you walk in you can you can tell the ambiance is quite classy and intimate. We walked in right when it opened and we're seated right away, however, it got pretty crowded by the hour so I would recommend to make a reservation.   This Brazilian steakhouse is basically an all you can eat steakhouse so definitely come on an empty stomach! They have servers walking around with a variety of meat and all you have to do is flip your card either green or red side up for the servers; green for go, red for stop. Once the server is at your table, you'll have your meat sliced right in front of you. In addition to this delicious meal, they have a salad bar to balance out the meat. They have variety of food like soup, salad, bread, and vegetables.   Another reason why I gave 5/5 stars is for their service. Our server gave an brief description of what we were about to get into and from time to time he would constantly ask if there is anything we need. Another pointer is that all of the servers would fold your napkin back into its original position so it's all nice and tidy when you come back to your table.   Last but not least, all of their soft drinks, coffee, and desserts are included in your meal. Desserts are limited 1 per person but they have a wide range to choose from, from a slice of cake to a cup of crème brûlée. Nothing could have ended a filling meal other than a sweet dessert."}
{"text":"I have been here a handful of times and it is always a great place! The staff is friendly and has an energetic and upbeat attitude. It's $50 for dinner per adult and you have access to their large salad bar which includes salad, cold sides, soup, potatoes, meat and cheese, sushi, and plenty of other options for the table. The salad bar has a huge tropical floral arrangement in the center.  You start at the salad bar and then move on to the meat! You get a small circle chip with green on one side meaning you want the carvers to come to the table and red on the other meaning you do not want any more meat. There are gentlemen who walk around the restaurant with different types and cuts of meats on a spit and they cut small pieces for you. The meat is cooked medium rare but it's so flavorful!   The restaurant itself is quite large with a huge wine selection. The tables are smaller and intimate; the lighting dim. I would say typically you spend around 1-1.5 hours dining. This is a great place and I will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I have visited the restaurant 2 Times and had a great experience the service was great the food oh the food fresh hot very good. The meat never stop coming my number one thing I like most the Brazilian sausage is so good I took a pound of it home my last visit last night I took a slice of carrot cake that was my midnight snack. Everyone should try it at least once Believe me you will enjoy your experience trust me. Only problem I have is there is not enough items on the hot/cold table. I WILL BE BACK THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR SERVICES"}
{"text":"This place is WAY overrated.  Salad bar selections are good and fresh but all the meats are way overcooked.  You can ask the server for more on the rare side but they seem to just say yes it is  and slice the piece of medium to med well. All the meats are very salty too The staff is pretty friendly.  They are not flexible at all though if you want to combine coupons or offers. The manager the night I was there was kind of a pompas dick. Not very sincere."}
{"text":"Having a great dinner with my family on my nephews birthday excellent food and service one of my favorite places to eat in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Not for vegetarians or \"light fare\" eaters... The flank steak, beef ribs and lamb chops are the business! Their condiment/salad bar is on point! Lobster bisque good; a bit sweet The cheese curds and plantains are second to none! If it weren't for the lady behind me at the birthday with her booty over my shoulder (my date's((she's beautiful)) face was in WTF OMG GTFOH mode for about 5 minutes) I'd have given 4.5 but it took the staff a while and some coaxing... All in all it's great, and every cocktail has kick! Good job, the staff is attentive and polite  Advice: any day you decide to go, make a reservation... They're always busy"}
{"text":"Food was delicious as always.  Cocktail not made well this time.  We went for the special lunchtime opening on Dec 18th for $24.99 but we were charged $44.99."}
{"text":"We went there for the very first time last night, a Friday night. Our server Carlos C. was amazing, but that was about the best of the night. We ended up spending 185.00 for the two of us for dinner and two alcoholic drinks each. So not worth it. The meats that came around were not that flavorful, the steak was tough. The best thing about the meal were the cinnamon sugar bananas. The cost of the meal was not worth it at all. We won't be going back at all. Salad bar was 'meh', as well."}
{"text":"After being back multiple times since first trip, it is still good just not as good as first experience.  It is very inconsistent, which isn't a good quality to have for such an expensive meal.   The bad:  One experience, the beef ribs were cold in the middle, but somehow still cooked.  I think they were just reheated from the night before.  Also, the steaks are unevenly cooked, not a huge problem for me but some people might have a probably with the fillets sometimes being med. rare and other times med well.  Finally, not a fault of the gaucho per se, but he flipped my spoon out of the bowl and on the table splattering soup.  This occurred as the manager was walking up to see how the meal was going.  The act was an accident, but then the manager didn't even get anyone to come clean it up, I had to ask the waiter.  The good:  The service.  Overall, our waiters have been fantastic.  One time a waiter was average, but I think that might just be compared to the others we have.  The food, yes it might be inconsistent, but overall really good."}
{"text":"Celebrated my son's birthday with family and the service was incredible!  The meats are delusions! Tasty side dishes and desserts too!  Had to pace ourselves. Our eyes were bigger than our belly.  I recommend this place for celebrations or just a great steak and much mire dinner on the town.  Drinks were made to our desire.  Overall great customer service and very well prepared cuts of meats.  Love it!! Hope you do too !"}
{"text":"My partner is Brasilian, and even he agreed this place was great. Lots of variety at the salad bar, and l the rodizio was wonderful. Caipirinhas were mixed--passion fruit got a better review than the lime   Caramel cheesecake.was delish, & espresso killed it.   Service was truly amazing."}
{"text":"Great service, amazing food, and our waitress was fantastic! With the exception of the lamb being a little tough a gamey, all the other meats were cooked perfectly and tasted amazing. For dessert we had the carrot cake which was moist throughout all three layers, and also the chocolate cake. That's more my wife's thing but she assures me it was quite delicious."}
{"text":"I just walked out and can't get over how awesome our experience was! This was the first time we came to Texas de Brazil (have been to other Brazilian steak houses) and this was by far my favorite! Our server Alejandro blow us away! He was so friendly, shook our hands when we came in, and was so hospitable the entire time.  The food was perfect! There wasn't a single item that didn't make me melt when taking a bite.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A great addition to the CLE food scene and a great spot if your traveling and in one of the nearby hotels. I've been to the one in Vegas and this is as good. Great bar!!!!  The salad bar is stocked, clean, and fresh. Lots of variety and some unique items like the shrimp with jalapeño and red onions. Charcuterie and sushi round the salads out. Great options for the vegetarian.   Our server was honestly awesome. Great personality, on top of things, and if we missed a meat that was being passed around, he sought it out for us.   Desert should not be missed. We tried 4 and shared and all were as good as described. It's pricey but I have no complaints and its added to locations I will return to with friends and family. Great for groups."}
{"text":"Ate dinner with relative and friends. Free parking in mall lot. Offerings of meat on large skewers: house sirloin, lamb chops, filet mignon wrapped in bacon, leg of lamb, flank steak, chicken, ribs, and other meats which I overlooked. Large salad bar and lobster bisque soup. Fried banana and bacon mashed potato was served with meal. Dark environment. I thought most of the meats here were very salty. Soup was good. Eaten at other Brazilian meat restaurants and their meats were less salty and more flavorfully spice. Lime flavored lamb chop was good. Filet mignon was tender. Flank and sirloin were tough. Dessert creme brulee and cheese cake were good if you you did not over eat the meats."}
{"text":"We came to splurge. We enjoyed the great service and the abundance of food. The services includes unlimited styles of meats. The bar area has side dishes to select from."}
{"text":"Texas de Brazil found their way to my stomach and therefore have found their way into my heart. I don't know why we didn't try this place sooner!  First of all, this Texas de Brazil is in a prime location: inside Town Square and minutes from the airport as well as the Strip. After a long day of shopping and/or taking in the sights, this would be a perfect option for dinner.   The process is simple. You're given a small double sided card. Green means go and red means stop. There are many different servers throughout the restaurant that will bring you many different varieties of meat. There's an unlimited salad bar so you can have sides with your meat. You're also given a side of mashed potatoes. They also give you a side of plantains that serves as a palate cleanser in between meats, but they are also a perfect sweet snack to have after your meal.  The service was wonderful and the atmosphere was exciting. The food was delicious and the meats were all cooked to perfection. It's clear that these guys are pros in their game. The only downside is the hefty price tag, but it's worth every penny in my opinion.   If you love meat or are looking for a unique take on a steak house, please do me a favor and try this place out. I will be back and I will be finding any reason to make up a special occasion to come here."}
{"text":"The Food and service were good, but there was so much noise in the restaurant you couldn't hear the person sitting across from you."}
{"text":"Our server Toni was the best! She's very nice! This place has the best food, the best service, very nice ambience!  The best restaurant, best service, best food ever. All the meat are delicious, freshly cooked, the Brazilian Cheesecake is the best!"}
{"text":"A clean salad bar with lots of selections. A variety of churrascos to choose from, some a bit salty. The interior was nicely designed and decorated, comparable to the upscale restaurants on the strip. The sangria was delicious! Great for big parties."}
{"text":"Came here with my husband for the first time on a Saturday evening date night. We had reservations and we were seating quickly upon entering the restaurant. Unfortunately our waiter came to explain everything to us, but his voice was so low we couldn't quite hear everything. But he had no problem answering our questions.  The salad bar was amazing and once we flipped our cards to green, the meat came and it all basically melts in your mouth, especially the braised ribs. They have at least 20 different meats,  mainly Beef, Pork, Lamb, Chicken, and Sausage. No seafood,  sadly enough. The garlic mashed potatoes were light and delicious. It was quite an experience. We even got dressert! I ordered 2 scoops of a vanilla ice-cream while my husband got the chocolate mousse cake. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!!!  I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Wow !!  Big restaurant. We need to wait 20 min but they have full bar to sit down and wait to call The salad bar is huge too ! Can get fresh veggies and great quality meat !"}
{"text":"Wow. If you leave this place hungry, shame on you.  We dined here for pittsburghrestaurantweek.com and loved our experience.  The salad bar is what gives it the 4 instead of 5 stars. The selections were not anything spectacular.  I was expecting something a bit more Latin  or Brazilian. The guachos were a bit slow to come around in the beginning, but soon were to frequent and brought delicious everything.   The bacon wrapped filet was out of this world. The leg of lamb was to die for. Our wine took a while to get to the table but wine service was great. I was so full I brought dessert home. For the restaurant week special the $35.14 price was amazingly worth it. They ended up getting $125 from us because of alcohol and coffee.    I will definitely be back.  Desiree was our fabulous server.  Her awesome accent made it a great experience."}
{"text":"MONIQUE IS AMAZING.  Planning a wedding dinner at Texas de Brazil, which is very stressful and the manager Monique went above and beyond. She made herself available even during non business hours. She offered ideas and suggestions to make things run smoothly.  She even thought of things I wouldn't even thought of.  She made extra efforts to be sure we were happy.   I'll update my review of food and service after the event...but Monique has been fantastic thus far..."}
{"text":"I LOVE this Salad Bar!!! Hubby goes for the meat, I go for all the delicious HOT and COLD unique items on the Salad bar... totally satisfied and SO filling!!! Absolutely the best chimmichurri ever!!! Could put it on everything!!! Yum!!"}
{"text":"the food was amazing and worth the price. Steven our server was attentive and on top of it. we had good conservations with him."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to go here because of the price but after going I would gladly pay that again. It's so worth it! The food is amazing and the service is great. I went for my birthday and had Carlos as our server. Everything was just awesome and carlos brought me a free birthday dessert and did a magic trick!"}
{"text":"I prefer this chain over Brasa in Cleveland. Delicious meats and a phenomenal salad bar. Service is top notch and you won't go home hungry. Cue the meat sweats."}
{"text":"We celebrated my husbands 70th birthday at Texas de Brazil. We had about 15 people join us...It was perfect...the service was outstanding, the food was delicious. I cannot say anything negative about this experience."}
{"text":"Terrible service ! Went for family dinner with parents and kids . We payed for 4 adults and prepare our own food for 2. 5 year old and 1 year old . At some point my mum gave a  lama ll piece from her plate to 2.5 year old just to try the taste . So at the end of our dinner we had to pay extra 5 $ for a kid , who basically didn't even eat anything .  So cheap !!!"}
{"text":"I don't know where to start off... because everything was delicious! Plus customer service was A1. They treated us with great meat and the sides were delicious. My boyfriend and I's first time dining here was the day before Valentine's Day. We actually think it's a little better than Fugo De Chao and it's cheaper , I think. Can't beat the price of $49.99 + tax per person. Plus, we got a coupon/promo that they were giving out because of valentine's day.   We loved everything from their cheese bread to their main courses, which was the meat, so juicy and tender!! And that creme brûlée was soooo good! Gotta try it! I wish I could've taken pictures but we were so hungry and enjoyed so much. I forgot. Coming back to take my parents here once they come down to visit."}
{"text":"Verdict: not bad, but never coming back. Overpriced. $44.99 for dinner and $24.99 for salad bar only.   When my husband and I went, about a quarter of the tables were occupied but yet, there was a 15-20 minute wait to be seated? The concept sounds awesome. Servers come around with different types of meat and you can get as much as you want with the green/red card. Green means to keep 'em coming and red means no more. The meats range from flank steak, lamb, chicken, filet mignon, sausage: all with varying methods of preparation. Although the quality of the meats seem decent, they are extremely over-salted. Possibly to make you drink more, fill you up faster so that you eat less. Sounds like a dirty trick to me, especially when you're paying $45 for it. I only had room for a few types of meat after all was said and done so I'm not sure if it was really worth that high price."}
{"text":"If you've never been here I suggest you try it at least once! You won't regret it.. Brazilian steak house that offers all types of meats.. They come around to your table with different cuts of meat.. At $50 a person you can pretty much eat your monies worth and more!   They offer a salad bar with all types of items to choose from.. My favorites are the lobster bisque, mushrooms with the sauce, tomatoes, green beans, roasted garlic, and don't forget the chimichurri sauce!  When you're ready for them to bring on the meat just flip over your button to the green side and get your tongs ready! My favorites are the house special, bacon wrapped filet, lamb chops, leg of lamb, garlic sirloin, flank steak,  beef ribs, and pork ribs! Lol almost everything.. They also bring complimentary bread, mash potatoes, and sugar plantains..   So yea I do love this place! A great place to celebrate anything, or just to go eat! Join their online club for discounts! They offer $25 off a dinner for 2 for birthday's and anniversaries! 20% off to military, veterans, and law enforcements!! Score!!"}
{"text":"Meh this place was just ok. Had 7:45 reservations and didn't get seated until 8:05 even though place was half empty. The seating designed sucked. Food was above average tasting. Had the lobster bisque soup with no lobster in it. Overall this place is average."}
{"text":"This is a protein lovers paradise. I reserved a table on trip advisor for a party of three, on a Tuesday night at 9 pm. The restaurant had a few people, but it wasn't overcrowded or noisy. The atmosphere was cozy and romantic. This wasn't a romantic occasion, but it had potential if that was what you were looking for. We started with the salad bar that had so many delicious choices that it could have been my dinner, but I had prepared for this experience, so I saved room for the MEAT. There were so many different kinds of protein that were brought to our table, I couldn't name all of them. I tried at least 6 different choices, if not more. The filet mignon was my favorite. The service was spot on. The dinner was $49.99 per person, not including drinks. I thought this was pretty reasonable for fine dining and the amount of food that was included. I would definitely visit this establishment again in the future."}
{"text":"Great service and food. Always have a great time here and it is always a place I recommend to people looking for place to celebrate. If you have a costco membership they sell gift cards for this place ($80 for $100 gift card) which means you are walking in at 20% discount right away. Even without that I would still recommend."}
{"text":"The inside of this place exudes decadence and the food is just as impressive. Their buffet counter has foods you've never seen in buffets and even had one item I've never eaten before.   Lots of unique drinks to choose from, too, but the selection of over a dozen exotic meats (that they hand slice at your table) is what made the experience truly memorable. You feel like you ate 12 different meals at 12 different restaurants. Was great tasting new types of meat for once.  Just make sure you leave room for dessert because they bring a dessert tray to your table at the end to show you all they have to offer and you won't want to say no when you see how delicious they all look.   Service was superb and the food was better than several of the pricier date night places we went to in downtown Cleveland. So glad to see Crocker Park getting better and better each year."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants to dine when having a craving for meat, especially since you get to choose and taste an array of different meats ranging from beef, chicken, lamb, pork, and sausage.  There's something for everyone, even the pickiest water as they also have a salad bar, soup, variety of cheeses and charcuterie. I love the chimichurri sauce and sautéed mushrooms.  I'm not a key lime pie kind of gal but my spouse ordered it and it was delish! Our server was friendly and patient with our restless infant - yes, I bring my infant to dinner because a girls gotta eat and I LOVE to eat!"}
{"text":"Excellent staff, service and selection of food!! Texas de Brazil help me host a \"Thursday Twin Takeover\" outing with over 15+ sets of twins flawlessly. I can't say enough about their helpfulness, courteousness and attentiveness. I highly recommend this Texas de Brazil location if you are looking to have a large gathering for a dinner party. Kudos to General Manager Mr. Craig Ross and staff. I have already rebooked for next year to comeback and celebrate Twinsdays!! FIVE Star rating however I would give them a 10!! Totally stellar experience."}
{"text":"A group of us recently dined at Texas de Brazil on a Thursday evening.  We had a 6:00 reservation and were seated immediately.  Our server came over, was quite informative about the beverage options and the majority of our party went to the salad bar.  Upon getting our plates the meat parade began.   We had multiple servers visit our table offering us multiple different types of meat.  All were delicious.  We were also asked if we had any favorites and they were sent over as well.  I highly recommend the bacon wrapped filet, lamb roast, and short rib.  Garlic mashed potatoes were tasty as well.  This restaurant is built on exemplary service.  Managers stopped by to check on us, wait staff was phenomenal.  They even offer 20% discount for a myriad of individuals (police, firefighters, education).  This isn't a place I'd go weekly but it is excellent.  Yes it is salty but the food is exceptional.  Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Twice I've been tot he Texas de Brazil in Irvine/Tustin, California.  SUPERB!  Everything was perfect:  the food, the salad bar, the service.  However, the LAS VEGAS Texas de Brazil was quite the opposite.  The meat (beef/steak) was tough regardless of the type (flank, ribs, filet) and the service from our assigned table server was practically non-existent.  The salad bar was excellent, same as in California.  Not sure I'd try this restaurant again the next time I'm in Nevada as it just wasn't up to the standards expected."}
{"text":"I have been hearing wonderful stories of the amazing meals my friends have been having at the Texas De Brazil in Baton Rouge; and I was counting the days  until the Woodmere location opened.  Last night my husband and I finally made time to treat ourselves and celebrate our 16th anniversary with a very special meal.  I am so happy we chose this!  From start to finish our meal was absolutely magnificent. We made reservations for a Tuesday night at 7PM.  The restaurant was not crowded and there was no line waiting.  We were greeted by the hostess and shown to our table.  She not only pulled out our chairs for us, but placed our napkins - even asking me if white napkins were OK, or did I prefer a black one. It was truly a detail in all my years of dining out I had never been asked.  She introduced us to Tony, our waiter for the evening and he explained to us about our meal. At Texas De Brazil you can have simply the salad bar or you can have it with the meats.  I cannot personally see why you would come to a Steak House and order a salad buuuut to each his own.  The salad bar is beautiful and it has all sorts of lovely items, fresh hearts of pal, tomato, romaine and endive, fresh mozzarella balls, even sushi, boiled shrimp, smoked prosciutto  and more. It is a gorgeous spread and laid out quite lavishly.  I sampled the romaine with their blue cheese dressing, some smoked prosciutto, mozzarella and a bowl of their lobster bisque.  It was the most unique bowl of bisque I ever tasted.  There is no meat in it at all but it had the best flavor I have ever had in a bisque. I highly recommend it.  My husband had a small salad plate as well sampling the cheeses, prosciutto, onion ceviche and the potatos au gratin.  He too enjoyed his selections.  It was then we began our true adventure of the evening....our meal. You have a disk by your glass that is red on one side and green on the other.  If you leave it on green carvers will come by your table with the most wonderful skewers of everything from chicken to bacon wrapped filet. It was heavenly.  We both love meat and so it was fun to taste all these magnificent flavors. My favorites included the Brazillan Picanha, bacon wrapped fillet, braised beef rib and the bacon wrapped chicken.  My husband agreed he loved the Picanha and the beef. I can honestly say for 30 minutes we were just in awe of how many items we were offered and how great they were.  As I told him I never even went back to get the Au Gratin Potatoes because I truly did not miss them... the meats were so good they truly needed no accompaniment. I did try the potatoes Tony brought to the table and they were very good! Now I will say we were really full but since we were celebrating we split a piece of Key Lime Pie and I took home a piece of the Brazilian cheesecake.  Both were just as wonderful as they looked and I cannot wait to have them again! We will definitly be back for more. It's just too good not to.  Is it pricey? Yes but its worth it!  I would rather pay $44.95 and have a great meal and enjoy as much as I want of as many kinds of meats as I want than $25.00 for a plate of one item that might be done half this well. Now there are some things I have learned like - the water they bring you costs $6. I will pass on that next time.  And cokes are $3 each so I might limit myself to one not 3.  But all in all I look forward to doing this again!  Very soon!"}
{"text":"Went for a prebirthday treat with great friends from work. I'm insanely full!! The meats were medium rare, and just kept coming and coming, the food was perfect. The salad bar and sides were top notch in quality. Service was impeccable."}
{"text":"For the past few years I have eaten here at least 8-10 times. Usually on special occasions such as birthdays and anniversaries. I've also eaten here for lunch. Every time has been very pleasant and have always left happy and full.    The salad bar has a great selection of sides ranging from seasoned cheeses to smoke salmon. It's always hard not to go a little overboard on the salad bar since they offer a great variety. Soups have always been good and they always offer between 4-5 kinds. On to the meats.    If you are looking for a specific meat your waiter/waitress will ask if there is a meat your looking for. Just let them know and eventually one of the servers will come by. If you are a fast eater just let the servers know you would like another serving. Serving size seems small but you have to remember you are being served pork, chicken, beef, and lamb. I've always been happy with the meats they served, never finding them too salty and they have never arrived dry.    If the price for dinner is too much for you I suggest trying them during lunch (look at the website to see when they are open for lunch). Definitely not as busy compared to dinner time and they seem to offer the same meats. I think it's great they are open for lunch because afterwards a walk( or waddle) to town square is needed after such a great big meal."}
{"text":"I was there yesterday it was so horrible to me usually they were pretty good throughout the day but yesterday I think there's a lot of leftover meat and all day I was using the restrooms after I got home it was horrible yesterday"}
{"text":"Food was excellent, no doubt. Servers were quick with the meat, which was not hard as the place was more than half empty. We found it way too pricey for a Sunday lunch and also our waiter was not very well informed (e.g., he did not mention the senior discount, which would have clearly applied to my parents-in-law. We found out later on their website when it was too late). It was a great experience but due to the high price I will not go back (i.e., there is better value for money out there)"}
{"text":"We've now been back 3 times and continue to love it.  Tonight we had the pleasure of having Damion as our server. He was so attentive and full of personality. He really made our dining experience even better.  Take my advice and ask to be seated in his section if he's working that day.  The salad bar is so delicious and I particularly love the couscous salad and the goat cheese -- yum!  Tonight I had an obscene number of fried bananas.  We can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Celebrated our daughters 20th birthday last night. After hearing such great reviews we decided to give it a try.  We made reservations for our party and were greeted by a very friendly staff and promptly seated without any wait. We were a bit confused as we didn't have menus just a drink menu, our server who was very good gave us instructions about the wonderful salad or lite bar which for me a vegetarian was great. We were told to start there and really weren't sure if we had even ordered. After a few minutes servers with so many different types of meat would come up to the table and offer everyone freshly sliced pieces of whatever they were serving. My husband and sons raved about the different choices, just some of the different meats they tried, filet, sirloin, flank, lamb chops (voted the best by our table) leg of lamb, Brazilian sausages, bacon wrapped chicken, Parmesan crusted chicken, I can't remember the rest,  they said everything was delicious. Mashed potatoes were great as well. Fried bananas I guess some people like them we didn't really care for them. Our boys tried the carrot cake, chocolate mousse cake and cheesecake all were wonderful, very large desserts and they ended up taking most of them home. Love the meat carvers uniforms. The manager came by and made sure everything was good. Even though the restaurant was pretty full the noice level never got too loud so it was nice to be able to talk and enjoy the night.  The coffee was the best I have had! Dessert for our daughter who was celebrating her birthday wAs on the House. My only complaint without a menu and being our first time there we had no idea what the cost per person was. It's pricey but everyone said it was worth it."}
{"text":"Meat? Unlimited you say? Brb making a reservation now..  This was my second visit at Texas de Brazil. I could write a run down of all the meats I tried but that'd be a bit overboard. It was super busy on the Friday night I visited, on top of that it was also Restaurant Week ($35, regularly $45).  FOOD: Ugh so delicious. Salad/sides bar was solid too. I always stock up on the asparagus and some greens to make me feel better about eating a village's worth of beef. Filet mignon and top sirloins were solid. I'd like to say that the BBQ brisket was not so great and the sauce was overpoweringly sweet (I'm a Kansas City girl, I just couldn't say no to trying BBQ in the Burgh). After awhile even though the flavor is good, you get sick of eating beef after two hours (yes we sat there for almost two hours, oops). Had to pass on dessert as I was slowly slipping into a food coma in my seat. My first visit I did get creme brûlée, and it tasted awfully \"egg-y\", not representative of a good creme brulee :(.   SERVICE: At first, it was slow as the beef took awhile to come out as I sat there with my little indicator on green impatiently waiting to feed my red meat addiction. They would come out with sausages or chicken, but my eyes and heart were set on some top sirloin and filet mignons. We were seated in a spot where they would usually come to us first out of the kitchen, and while you might think that's a great thing, my boyfriend commented on how we got the kind of burnt/too crispy outsides of meat.    I smell like beef.."}
{"text":"Excellent service and phenomenal food!  This is a great dining experience all around!"}
{"text":"We ate here over the weekend. My wife and our friends have a tradition of eating Brazilian grill when we get together.   Let's start by going in there buffet bar. It was exquisite with fresh and premium choices of hoer derves, charcuterie, salad, and lobster bisque. They give you cheese balls, there version of plantain bananas to clear your pallet when trying new meats, and mash potatoes on your table.   I always eat light on the buffet because I pay for the meats. I thought their cuts of meat where marinated splendidly. I saw and ate at least a dozen cuts of meat, and I am sure there were more. My favorite was beef ribs, the most moist cut there and it melts in your mouth like butter. You can request for meats and they will bring it to your table. The meats will keep on coming as long as your tab on your table is green.   Overall eating here is fantastic experience from the service to the food and to the environment it is worth price. Lastly, the customer service here is amazing so make sure you tip your servers well. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a great Brazilian grill experience."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food, the staff and the service is awesome! My husband took me for our anniversary. Our server Matthew was great and very professional.  They are very attentive. You do not leave this place hungry.  I am definitely going again. Well worth it!"}
{"text":"We went here on Saturday for lunch.  While they were busy they were by no means crazy busy.  I have been to a couple Brazilian steakhouses but not this brand.  The food was great.....when it came around.  There were many times we had clean plates waiting for someone to come around with more meat.  While the salad bar was always stocked I did not come here to spend $29.99 to eat salad. Our server was OK, nothing spectacular and by no means a ball of fire.  The last Brazilian steakhouse I ate at, the waiter was always bringing clean plates and taking away dirty ones.  We had to go to the salad bar for clean plates several times and the dirty ones sat on our table for quite a while before they were taken away.  Our waiter never once brought clean plates or  brought out more bread.   All in all for the price we paid, it was an ok experience, however next time I am going to spend that kind of money, I will go to the Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"This place is great! My friend mentioned a place where we they serve meat at your table and an all you can eat salad bar. Why would you want to eat dinner anywhere else? It's accommodating that it's $50 bucks a person but all the sizzling meat (sirloin, prime, chicken, medium rare, rare) it's so worth it!   The minute I walked in the hostess was really friendly and I liked how she sparked up a conversation. The setting looked really nice and fancy. Interior felt like a Brazilian getaway vacation. The waiters and waitresses were all sharp buttoned up flannels and all. The waitress quickly greeted us saying there are more than 60 choices in the salad buffet and did I mention that they have shrimp and salmon in the salad bar? Yes I said it!  The minute you've stepped in here you can smell the marinated steak turning in the kitchen. The meat just melts in your mouth and seasoned just the way I like it. Definitely bringing my appetite back!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Texas de Brazil but the last two visits to this location has left me less thrilled about this location.  This past Saturday we were a table of 5.  We were seated by the front door and the gauchos hardly came around at all.  We spoke with the server a couple times about this and it didn't pick up.  We also mentioned one in our party wanted me a little more cooked and she only ended up with a couple pieces of flank steak.  The filet never made an appearance at our table which was a shame.  My husband left hungry -- something that should never happen at Texas de Brazil.  I will always love the salad bar but people come for the meat and expect to leave in a meat coma with that kind of price tag.  It'll probably be a while until we return and I've also learned my lesson that it's a waste of money to bring someone who doesn't like medium-rare because they won't get nearly as much to eat. As a party of 5 this was a $300+ meal. 15% off is insulting.  Update: While I appreciate Texas de Brazil's corporate office reaching out to me, I'm not pleased with the result. I did email them as they requested and they sent me a 15% off coupon that can only be used on the meal...dessert isn't even included. This isn't motivating to get me back in the door because they email me coupons all the time...and sometimes better deals than this!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing and worth every price. Adam as a server gives great service and is very knowledgeable. He made it more enjoyable by bringing every meat we wanted fresh! Definitely a great spot if you want some good steak!"}
{"text":"This is such a great place to eat, and the meat isn't even the main draw for me! To start with, they have such a huge selection of wine and cocktails. My personal favorite is the strawberry mimosa! They have a few different flavors to choose from. The salad bar and hot items are why I love this place so much! Their lobster bisque is the best I've ever had anywhere.  It's buttery and so well seasoned. They have the best spicy shrimp dish, goat cheese spread and charcuterie selection plus so much more. When you're done with the salad bar, they bring out fried bananas, garlic mashed potatoes and Brazilian cheese puff bread for the meat course. Every type of meat you could possibly want cooked at every possible temperature is brought right to your table. The service is always wonderful and they are always on top of refilling sides and drinks. If you have room, the dessert is always great. The Brazilian cheesecake is wonderful. This place is always a great time."}
{"text":"If you've never been to a Brazilian steak house I highly recommend it. It's such a unique experience that's unlike any other restaurant. This particular place would be a perfect spot to go if you never been to anything like before or if you just love that kind of experience. It's sure to be delicious either way!  At Brazilian steak house the meats are essentially brought around to your table on these giant kabob skewers and serves slice off a port directly on your plate. All the meat options are great quality and they have amazing variety. If your feeling adventurous there are options like chicken hearts, but they also have a variety of classic cuts of steak, pork, and even chicken wings. Because it is a buffet you can have as much of each cut of meat that you want and the servers will keep bringing more to your table and asking if you'd like some until you flip your place card to the \"stop\" side!  There is also a transitional, but upscale, buffet portion that is filled with side dishes, salads, and appetizers to accompany the meat that is being served to you directly!  They have amazing selection here too, there's almost too many things to try!  Yes this is an expensive place but it's definitely worth it considering the quality and quantity of food you can get. Not to the mention to the unique table side service! A must try!"}
{"text":"I had a $20.00 off coupon. Went Thursday early. There aren't as many people at that time (5:00).  Pork was over cooked, chicken over cooked.  The flank steak, picanta, leg of lamb, lamb chops filet s were awesome. I recommend going when its more crowded because the food turnover would be better.  Ashley, our server was fantastic.  My favorite gauche wasn't working but that's ok. The last problem I have is that they got rid of sauteed mushrooms. Boo.  Lol"}
{"text":"This place is excellent! Of course it's new, so it should be great but I have to say, the service, food quality, and selection is superb. At least two managers touched our table and all of the servers were eager to please. The meats were delicious and perfectly cooked, the vegetables, cheeses, rice etc were all fresh, fluffy, and tasty. The dining room is pretty and large with a private room. I felt I received a decent value for my $45.00. This may become one of my favorite midscale chain restaurants. Let's see if they stay consistent when I go back which I hope it soon!"}
{"text":"Over rated & over priced! The service was excellent and the food was very good. Very attractive looking but very noisy. The salad bar was extensive but not the greatest. I would not return here."}
{"text":"I'm not easily impressed, but this place was spot on with everything. From start to finish, everything was exceptional. The salad bar to start had cheeses, smoked salmon, shrimp, tabouli, crusty bread, etc. all gourmet, nothing done on the cheap. Soup of the day, lobster bisque was the best I've had in a long time. (No chunks of lobster, yet superbly delicious) the Churrassco(skewers of meat) were hot off the grill, perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection. Service by Chris was exceptional and classy. Finished off with a perfect creme brûlée. Lovely night and overall great experience!"}
{"text":"This place is a must go to whenever we're in Vegas. The salad bar alone could be an excellent meal, especially for people not into steak/meat. All the meat is good but favorites are short rib, sirloin, filet mignon."}
{"text":"I have to say that the salad bar if you could call it that blew me away. The variety of food was amazing!  It goes way beyond salad bar expectations!!! To me if you could have thar only than I would eat there all the time.    I am a big meat fan and I was definitely disappointed.  The variety of meats was amazing but the flavor was meh. I had one piece of the tenderloin beef that was excellent.  The rest I found tasteless, or a chemically taste that you sometimes get off grills.  The chicken was okay, rather dry and even though I am not a lamb fan I still tried to see if it changed my mind and it didn't."}
{"text":"First time at a Brazilian steak house, but the friend in our party of 4 said it was just as good as one he raved about in Montreal.   Know thy self before going into this fantastic spot.   If you want to go the salad/food bar route with an amazing selection of dressings, prosciutto, cheeses, lobster bisque, California rolls and so on...due so without shame. Not everyday should be one where you tackle mountains of endless meat.   If you do possess the fortitude to go full Monty on the full dinner...Godspeed. Rule #1: skip the sausage. This may feel dirty and normally I'd agree. However, every sausage you turn your back on leaves more opportunity for filet, bacon-wrapped filet, flank, lamb chop, rack of lamb, a countless collection of other meats and those little cheese filled table rolls.   Either decision will pay dividends. Choose wisely.  *Amendment* I was encouraged to tell the REAL story about my experience at Texas De Brazil. Please don't continue if you are sensitive to graphic imagery.  I'm ashamed to say this was my first time at a Brazilian Steakhouse. I was so over-whelmed by the constant temptation of filet, bacon wrapped filet, more filet, top siloin...O! there's the filet again!   *I'm warning you...this is where it gets weird*  As my party and I exited Texas De Brazil and made our way toward the parking deck I could feel the pressure building. My pace quickened. My knowledge of the interior lobby of the Sheraton I was walking toward was my salvation. As I began to run I turned to my friends and yelled \"SHERATON!\" assuming they could piece together the immediacy of my situation.   *Seriously. Last chance.*  The order of events once hurriedly inside of the hotel restroom went as such: -Seat cover -Sit -Wipe -Flush -Turn -Vomit -Flush -Turn back around to sit again -Flush  I had eaten so much meat that I nearly exploded. That being said...can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Never had a bad or even mediocre experience here. Always outstanding in Service and food. This time the beef rib and flank steak were cut with your fork tender and delicious.  Always a stop when ever we come to town."}
{"text":"All I can say is TDB is simply hands down the best  Brazilian bbq I've ever had. The $50 price is a decent value but if you buy the VIP card that the sell in March only makes this super affordable.  The card sells for $75 and gives you 12 50% off dinner coupons, now the only drawback is it can only be used Sunday-Thursday and no holidays.   All I can say is every bite of everything is a magnificent flavor explosion.   My #1 favorite restaurant!!!!!"}
{"text":"The first time I experienced Brazilian cuisine was in 2011 on a Royal Caribbean cruise.  It was a specialty restaurant and was worth every penny!!  The service was superb but being on a cruise, we assumed it was due to their experience.    For my birthday, my husband surprised me with Pittsburgh's Texas de Brazil and scored total bonus points!  We don't eat red meat and we let them know ahead of time... not one gaucho came over to our table with red meat - it was fantastic!  It was really busy too so they were good.    The salad bar was much more than expected, I could probably get enough from that only but I would NEVER pass up on the meat.  The lobster bisque is amazing and I can't say that I will ever have a bowl as good as this!  A manager came over to check on us but wasn't annoying, simply cared how our experience was.  We loved it so much we went back the next week and the place isn't cheap!  That's about $200 in two weeks to eat here.  I don't regret it.  I'd do it again.    Make reservations online because they do get busy and also join their birthday club - one free meal!"}
{"text":"After reading some reviews I was a bit worried about trying this place, since some were saying waiting times were too long, the meat was too salty, they had trouble redeeming coupons, etc. After having eaten there, it was for the most part a positive experience, but with a few issues.   I'll start with the positives. The hostess was pleasant and sat us right away (although it was a Wednesday, so that probably helped). Our waitress was attentive and friendly and provided good service. The salad bar had a pretty decent selection; I particularly enjoyed the au gratin potatoes and I thought they were rich and cheesy. I also liked the pan de queijo served with the meal, a nice bread with a cheesy center. That's all unlimited, which is another plus. To cleanse your palate in between they offered us plantains fried with cinnamon and sugar, along with garlic mashed potatoes. I thought the plantain was decent, and would recommend trying it if you have a sweet tooth. After our meal, when it came time to pay, we forgot to tell our waitress we had a coupon for $25 off, and she politely got us a new, discounted total, which I thought was nice, because we really should have told her earlier.  Although there were some definite positives, there were also a few things I didn't like. The soup of the day was lobster bisque, and although it tasted okay, there were no pieces of lobster at all; it was all liquid. I also thought that the overall quality of the meat was just average. It really all just tasted like meat I could have cooked on my grill at home; the Brazilian sausage, to me, tasted like Eckrich kielbasa. I also did not like how undercooked some of the meat was. I like pink in my steaks, but some of it was too red for my liking. I know this is to be expected at a steakhouse, but I think they should have some cuts cooked more to appeal to customers who maybe want to try certain meats but don't like rare steaks (I thought the rare meat was just okay, but it's not what I personally like). I also have to agree to an extent with the people saying the meat was a bit salty. Not all of it was, but some definitely had a bit too much. Also, while the meat carvers were very attentive, sometimes they were a bit too attentive. They continued to offer us meat even after having turned our card over to the red half indicating we did not want any at that time. The manager was nice, but he came over to our table several times to ask if everything was okay; it's good that he wanted to ask that, but I think he overdid it.   Overall, I think this was an okay experience. I would return, but only at someone else's request for a special event; I won't be making the choice myself. I feel that the quality of the meat wasn't as good for the price you pay. I'd want to try Green Forest in Penn Hills before coming back here. It may be worth it for you, the reader of this review, to try it once though, just for the experience. It is unlimited steak after all, and you'll likely find something you enjoy between all the choices of meat and items at the salad bar. The other person I went with really enjoyed it, so there's that too; you may love it, you may not. Try it and see for yourself."}
{"text":"Fabulous service. Great food. The variety was out of this world. Everything was delicious."}
{"text":"A fantastic, clean and spacious location.  I enjoyed all of the beef cuts and Portuguese sausage!  My favorites were the Garlic Sirloin, Beef Ribs, and Flank Steak.  It's worth every cent for the beef and Portuguese sausage.  I would give 5 stars if it was focused just on those things.  Every thing else... I wasn't impressed with. Highly recommended for fans of Brazilian BBQ!"}
{"text":"I read all of these reviews and almost talked myself out of Texas de Brazil. I am glad I made it. It was delicious, exciting, and exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"Everything was fantastic! Food, service and ambiance was much better than we expected. Meats cooked to perfection! Filet Mignon and the House Special top sirloin was my favorite and many on our table loved the lamb. I was so full I didn't get to the lamb! But next time I will. We will be back every time we come back to Vegas!"}
{"text":"As always this place was delicious. Meats were delicious and their salad bar is always a favorite. Especially with their lobster bisc. #yummy.   The only reason they did not get 5 stars was because in my reservations I specifically requested a quiet table nowhere near the salad bar and where did the sit us?  Yeah.... literally right next to the salad bar.  They did however make up for it by throwing the extras for my son as we were there celebrating his birthday."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Excellent food. Great ambiance. There really is nothing bad to say about our experience. They do such a good job of having a variety of meats circulating at all times and sending over anything you want to see again (similar chains I have been to have really struggled with this). The best is their house special which I think is a top sirloin. It is AMAZING. The other thing that really stood out was the filet. Their flan is particularly good as well."}
{"text":"I finally ventured in here for lunch today - I heard good things and wasn't disappointed.  Everyone will comment on how the restaurant operates, but what about the FOOD??  I was pleasantly surprised with the flavor and quality of everything from the salad bar to the roasted meats.  I thought maybe this place would be so focused on their 'unique' dining experience that the food would suffer - not the case!  A few things to note that might be helpful:  1. Lunch offerings are different than dinner.  Cheaper price but less options on salad bar as well as with meat options. 2. You can go to Costco and buy $100 gift cards for $79. 3. If you're paying with gift card - you CANNOT place a tip on your bill.  Cash only. 4  Go on their website and sign up for their email list a few days prior for a \"$25 off dinner for two coupon\". 5. You have the option to just purchase the salad bar at a much lower price, if that's your thing.  Will be going back soon to hit up the salad bar (I still have $30 left on my giftcard.)"}
{"text":"Yes, the food is five stars and yes the service was five star. This is one of the best things about Vegas. Never ending places to eat. This diner and her husband did enjoy eating here. Super staff and wonderful service from front to back. We will be back."}
{"text":"Perhaps the best value in Las Vegas. Everyone at this place bends over backyards to make you happy, and the food is out of this world. Check the bar for Brazilian inspired coctails, but I would recommend either Lyft or Uber later on in the evening. All good!"}
{"text":"Let's start by saying the food was delicious and the staff inside were very nice. The restaurant was clean in general and even though the tables are pretty cramped it didn't feel as crowded as it was.  However, the wait... They gave us an estimated wait time of an hour, wrote down our phone number and told us they would call. But they never did, so about an hour later we returned, and were told they would sit us in about five minutes... About 15 minutes later we asked again and were told \"a few more minutes\"... 20 minutes later we asked again, and at this point the hostess told my husband, who was obviously upset, that we \"got here at 6 and your wait time was an hour\"... it was 7:40!!! It still took another 5 minutes to get seated.  We would have left but it was my birthday and my husband had promised to take me to this restaurant because I wanted to try it so bad. And although the food was great, I don't think it was worth waiting almost 2 hours for, nor the price tag..."}
{"text":"Fogo de chao was closed so I decided to come this place. They have bottle of sodas instead of serving with can or from soda machine. That was really cute. Service was great,had many veges at salad bar but meat was just soso. Sorry but I will go to fogo de chao instead of here"}
{"text":"Finally an AYCE that I can get behind!   I've eaten here a bunch of times and this is my favorite Brazilian steakhouse in the area. I can't think of a time where I haven't had great service here. It's well worth the price of admission. Bring with you your best appetite and bring on the mouthwatering mmmmmeat! Flip that button to green for go and the men with their big meat sticks and long swords will not leave you alone. You want something? You got it! I could get used to this...  The salad bar does not disappoint either. Clean as can be... none of this one dish spilling into another nastiness and stuff sitting out where you're wondering whether it's still good or not. They bill themselves as being the steakhouse that even vegetarians will love and I can see why. This is high quality food for a fair price for what you are getting. That's why my friends and I eat here regularly and the place is always packed."}
{"text":"Food was phenomenal. It was like a food adventurem. Staff was very  attentive and friendly. Managers are attentive and very visible. I've never had anything like it and it was delicious. They have chicken, beef, sausage and pork. Atmosphere is very appealing and beautiful . loved having dinner here !"}
{"text":"This place is a lot of fun! Our server was Felipe and he was very nice and attentive. The salad bar was delicious and all the guys with the meat were so helpful and brought anything we requested. Literally as soon as I flipped my card to green I had 3 different types of meat to choose from. It was wonderful lol! Will definitely return & recommend!"}
{"text":"Wonderful selection of items from salad bar.  The meat selection is wonderful but way too much food.  You need to pace yourself.  We did have a problem.  This was an anniversary dinner.  We were told that we get dessert.  When we got the bill they did not take the desserts off the bill.  We where charged $9.00 each for a so-so dessert Really!  It turns out we only get one dessert only.  This is a trick.  We were not told this before hand.  We would never pay $9.00 for a dessert.  They ended up taking them off the bill but we had already paid the server.  So it appears the server ended up getting a bigger tip.    Be careful of extras!  The full dinner is $44.99 and salad only is $24.99 ."}
{"text":"A very nice place with a nice decor. A good concept in fine dinning . Enjoyed the nice atmosphere and everyone was very friendly. This is a great place to indulge yourself to all you can eat \" to very good and tastefully prepared barbeque \". The nice salad bar with ample selections compliments the main course all in just one price. Service is simply amazing. Make sure you skip the breakfast and lunch before heading out with family or friends in the evening. Would most definately come back. Will highly recommend this place.  Thx  DR MD"}
{"text":"Food was great service wasn't. I had the green side of my card facing up to be serviced more food. Twice in a row my husband was serviced but not me."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas for special occasions. This last visit did not disappoint! The ambience, staff, food was fantastic. It is $50 per person, and worth it!!"}
{"text":"Sim, Por Favor  As for me, I visit a steakhouse for the steak!  Green means go!!  Flank steak, garlic sirloin, and filet mignon filled one side of my plate while smoked salmon and fresh veggies filled the other.  Red Sangria sat at 2 o'clock, the garlic mashed potatoes with cheese bread sat at 3 o'clock, and my right hand with fork at 4.  Afterwards, I couldn't decide between the pecan pie and the Brazilian cheesecake, then I had to make a decision...... Chocolate Mousse Cake!!  Don't forget to sign up for discounts online.  Now back to my regularly scheduled homemade nutrient-dense organic smoothies..."}
{"text":"I have been here close to a dozen times and every time I leave here I have a huge smile on my face!  The customer service is fantastic and the food is even better!!!!!  The garlic sirloin is my absolute favorite and the smoked salmon from the salad is absolute heaven!!  Do yourself a favor and stop by Texas de Brazil!!!!"}
{"text":"Been here on three occasions, great each time. Great selections of meat and the salad/appetizer bar was awesome. Besides the mint and chimmichurra sauces they have a selection of vinegars an olive oil, as well as different sauces  with the various items on the buffet that I used as dipping sauces for the meats, helps to change the \"sameness\" of the seasoning on the meats. On the buffet, I especially like the salmon, pineapple carpaccio, asparagus the different pickled peppers an d other veggies, and the Italian meats.  I do believe the cocktail and wine prices are very over inflated. Some wine selections were priced at 4 times the price of at the store. The martini and after dinner drink were pricey, which is okay if you get a good sized drink, they were short pours. But I suppose the market they are in supports that. These issues aside, this place is great. The buffet, the meats, the sides, and desserts were awesome. Can not wait to go back."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic.  Huge salad bar with many interesting and tasty items. Chicken, ribs,pork and beef all perfectly done. Sadly,  none of these closer to home but definitely a must visit when in Pittsburgh. Specialty cocktails quite potent."}
{"text":"After four other options, we ended up here tonight to celebrate early Valentine's Day... and I must say, no regrets there. BEST STEAKHOUSE EVER! We did have to wait an hour, but that was expected because it is the weekend and we had no reservations.   Food was bomb! Best tasting meat I have ever had!  We were so full that we didn't have room for desserts, haha! So glad we came here tonight. We are definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I couldn't wait to eat at Texas de Brazil because we use to have an all you can eat Brazilian restaurant in Hawaii but it closed down.   This place is located in Town Square. Here's there hours for dinner.  Mon - Thurs: 5pm - 10pm Fri: 5pm - 10:30pm Sat: 4pm - 10:30pm Sun: 4pm - 10pm  They have parking right in the front and it's easy to find. We went around 5:30p and we had a reservation. We waited about 10 minutes and we were seated. The staff is really nice and our cups were always filled.   Pricing is $49.99 per head. And $24.99 for salad area only. I wouldn't recommend that being that it's an all you can eat meat place. They do offer military discount. The meats were all amazing and they kept bringing meats to your table unless you flipped your card to red. Each table will have a double sided green/red card.   The restaurant is big and spacious so you're not too close to everyone. The staff definitely keep bringing you food so charge your card if you don't want meat. I can't even list all the meats that they had. There salad bar was nice too! Pace yourself...  If you're in the area go check them out. You won't regret it. Don't eat anything to prepare yourself :)"}
{"text":"I've eaten at various Brazilian steakhouse before. I'm a big fan of red meats.. And I Have to say.. This place.. Hands down is the best. The servie, the meats, the salad bar.. It was all delicious and fabulous!"}
{"text":"I'm finally getting around to writing a well deserved review.  Texas de Brazil is one of my, and my boyfriend's special occasion restaurants,  and trust me, you won't be disappointed.  We went here on Thanksgiving,  because we don't cook on holidays,  and the experience was beyond amazing.  You can make a meal off the salad bar alone, which if they don't have it on their salad bar, it doesn't exist,  because it's not just your run of the mill salad bar, and my boyfriend ALWAYS gets his fill of meat, which they make sure you get, and the service is beyond belief. The servers,  hosts, everyone,  always act like they're glad to see, and can't do enough for you. This is another resturant that we plan to take our granddaughter too when she visits,  so she can learn how to act in nice restaurants. Texas de Brazil is another resturant that I wish I could give more than five stars to."}
{"text":"I love TDB, I come here 3/4  times a year. My boyfriend and I celebrate special occasions (bdays, anniversary) here because we just love the food and service. Reservations are highly recommended. They have a plentiful salad bar with fresh cold meats, cheeses, olives, and salads for you to enjoy. They also serve hot items on the salad bar, including lobster bisque which is amazing and au gratin potatoes which are to die for. They are creamy and cheesy, and I prefer these over any of the hot sides they bring to the table. Hot sides usually consist of mashed potatoes, fried bananas and cheese bread.  The main star of the show is of course the meats. I love all the meats they have to offer. My favorite is the garlic Picanha. It is so flavorful. I also like the filet mignon. You can choose how done you want the meat too, anywhere from mooing, all the way to well done. Other meats they have are parmesan chicken and pork, bacon wrapped filet mignon, brazilian sausage, leg of lamb, beef and pork ribs, and flank steak. I found a few of the meats were a bit too salty, so I ended up drinking A LOT of water. Make sure to grab some Brazilian vinaigrette and Chimichurri at the salad bar. Both of these sauces complement the meats excellently. The service is always amazing. I can't say enough good things about this place."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great staff, I enjoyed dinner with my husband for his birthday and it was beyond my expectations. The waiter was sweet and very attentive and the food was delicious. Definitely recommend this place for any meat lovers out there trying to get their money's worth."}
{"text":"Yum.  At first we didn't know what to expect. It was a fine dining experience.  You have the choice of getting the salad bar only or \"with meat\". We started with the salad bar. It had a wide variety of authentic dishes.  The lettuce consisted of romaine along with another mixed salad. The quality was A++ and amazing.  They also had lobster bisque soup, au gratin potatoes, black beans, Brazilian potato salad and so much more.   We opted not to get the meat, as the salad bar alone was very satisfying. With regard to the meat, the waiters bring around skews of meat right to your table. They have about 20 different types to try.  Next time we will opt for less salad bar and more meat because it all looked amazing.   A little expensive but so worth the money for high quality and superbly fresh food.  The only thing was that it was quite cold in there but luckily I brought a sweater!"}
{"text":"This place is always a winner for me. Beware if the salad bar. If you eat too much like I always do, you will have no room for the meat selection. I have decided to just to the salad bar. My husband said the sirloin was EXCELLENT."}
{"text":"I'm a server in NYC, and absolutely adore great service! I made a reservation for this restaurant and made many second guesses about it, based on some YELP reviews. But, I don't regret it! I came to celebrate my boyfriends birthday and my waitress Franciel was such a sweetheart and very intent with us. My boyfriend and I loved the atmosphere, very unique. The Brazilian cheesecake and special drink was spot on and delish! We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Terrible people. Good food. We come here whenever we are in town, on one particular occasion a server dropped a drink on my little girls head, she was soaking wet and screaming...we didn't even get to eat our food we had to leave. When I got home I called the general manager unhappy about what happened...and he said next time we come back in town he would take care of our dinner(we are from Boston) when I called back the same manager basically laughed in my face and said he will not honor what we promised! How could they hurt a little girl and not even care? Extremely rude management staff I will never refer anyone here again."}
{"text":"Our family's favorite place to eat. It always ends up being the choice for birthday dinner out. Amazing meat and salad bar, and they'll bring us the meat cooked how we request."}
{"text":"Great value for lunch at $31 Great salad bar with one of the best real smoked salmones Great location on the strip at one of the best malls in vegas Great meat variety  It deserves 5 starts though fogo de chow will have to have 6 stars then."}
{"text":"Team dinner - they had great meat rotation and quick service. However, some meats took a bit too long, dessert took forever and their $5 cappuccino didn't include a biscuit."}
{"text":"I love Brazilian steakhouses and this is the spot I go when we have special occasions or a coupon because it's always decent and you can eat tons of meat. Lamb chops are the best and I also enjoy their picanha."}
{"text":"This place does not need anyone's stinking review- they know what they are doing and they are doing it well. Been going there for years and every time it's impeccable service and fantastic food. I like that their managers are working right alongside with the employees, setting tables and overseeing operation with eagle-like eyes. The servers are smiling, all the food is prepared so well that I never have to guess what it is that I'm eating. I can only wish there're more restaurants like that."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service.  I would have liked the red meats to come through more often (flank steak and sirloin), but I suppose they need to keep circulating all the other choices.  Worth a try, but since I never make my money's worth on a buffet, not somewhere I would regularly go to.   If you sign up for their eClub, there are decent deals.  I knew we were going to try this place in Vegas so I signed up a couple weeks before.  I ended up using a $25 off dinner for 2 deal. So not bad for a steak dinner."}
{"text":"I give it to the gentleman working the bar the evening we came. If it weren't for him, we'd probably have had a terrible time.   Located in the town square plaza with shopping centers.   We walked in and asked about the menu and if there were a la carte options or plain all you can eat/salad bar. The lady was rude and kept reiterating it was all you can eat and I was like I get it, but are there a la carte options in case an individual wasn't in the mood to stuff his or her face?! It ticked me off the nerve she had.   We resorted to the bar area, which is cute and dainty with lounge tables that can seat 2-4 people or the bar top of course.   We only had a few drinks, in which the gentleman (I wish we got his name) recommended and what their known for. I couldn't believe how fresh and delicious they were!   We didn't eat here, it was already 9pm and we decided not to be left with the leftovers of the evening and left on our way. But we had a great time chatting with him and enjoyed amazingly refreshing drinks. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Fantástico.  Excelente lugar para trazer aa família Passar tempos bons comida e amigos para rever."}
{"text":"We go here for almost all our big events. The food is always great and the service is never disappointing. I always ask for the pork chops to come my way. They are usually busy to make your reservations. They're open for lunch too. If you want never ending meats, I recommend this. :D"}
{"text":"I love Texas de Brazil. For one, you know EXACTLY what you're going to get. High quality, flavorful, delicious food.   I have been to TDB in the past but this was my first time at this location. The food was equally great, upkeep of the premises, and prices.   My server was not as attentive as I am used to so that's why there's a missing star.   Anyways, if you're even thinking of a churrascaria, look no further! This TDB will not disappoint!!"}
{"text":"Ah, the meat lovers paradise! I hadn't been to Texas de Brazil in quite awhile, but it was as I remembered. The salad bar isn't all that exciting, but you come for the meat, right? The standouts for me on the salad bar were the fish stew, which had a great flavor and big chunks of fish in it. The potatoes au gratin were nice and cheesy, and the garlic shrimp was also pretty good. I appreciated having some seafood options amidst all of the meat we were about to feast upon.  This was probably the first time I've been here that I didn't stuff myself silly. I was very strategic and didn't eat everything that came around, so I could really enjoy the things I did. My favorites were the bacon wrapped filet (although the first piece was definitely better than the second), the lamb chop, and the bbq brisket.   I only had a few bites of the mashed potatoes, but they were as expected. The caramelized banana was great, we actually ate that as a dessert. And I enjoyed the bread puffs too. We also received a complementary dessert to celebrate our anniversary, which we took to go. Don't be fooled, the slice of carrot cake you get won't be nearly as big as the one on the display tray!   Our server was pleasant and attentive and all of the meat servers were great as well. I may not be back for awhile, but I will return!"}
{"text":"All you can eat quality meat?  Yes, please.  A long time ago I visited one of these in Texas and instantly fell in love.  All kinds of meat, cooked all kinds of ways, and a salad bar with sushi.  My favorites are the house special (I believe it is top sirloin) and the filet mignon.  I am also a huge fan of the Brazilian sausage.  I am also one of those people that will order, like, 6 dishes of sweet fried bananas.  Seriously, that's my favorite 'dessert' even though it's a side.  The past couple of times I've been the service has not been over-the-moon like my first few visits here.  I am not sure if it's just luck of the draw or if they're getting some new faces, but our last server, Marina, barely checked on our table and we had to hunt her down to get specific meats sent to our table.  This is definitely one of my favorite splurge spots in the valley.  While the price is a little steep ($50/person), you are paying for serious quality and (usually) great service.  They also had a VIP Card special this year: you pay $59.99 and receive a punch card with 12 punches.  Each of those punches equals 50% off the normal price, so you save ~$260.  Hopefully they do it again next year.  As much as I'd like to eat here weekly, I'm pretty sure I'd explode in a shower of meat and bananas, so it's a good thing that it's a special occasion spot."}
{"text":"AYCE meat and an unlimited buffet?! Yes! This was a first time for both my boyfriend and me, but he's been to a similar all you can eat Brazilian Steakhouse. And since we were in Las Vegas, why not try this popular place out! First off, I highly recommend making reservations like we did even for a party of two. It was definitely busy at around 6 PM, so make reservations so you don't wait long.   Like I mentioned above, there is an unlimited buffet which included a variety of salads, cheese, salami, veggies, sushi, soups, breads, and other various foods to accompany your meat. Your table also automatically receives mashed potatoes, mini bread rolls, and plantains. If the soup of the day is the lobster bisque - get it! Nice way to start the service. I recommend not taking a lot good from the buffet area because it may make you full before you even try your meats!  And once you sit down you can start trying the various meats they have to offer! All come out steaming hot and there are servers who come around asking if you want a particular meat from different cuts of steak, chicken, sausage, lamb, etc. There's a small sign that you flip to green if you want meat and a red one to say no thanks. We absolutely loved the flank steak! It had a nice small fat layer to meat that made it super delicious! We had to keep asking for more! Wish we got to try every cut of meat, but our stomachs wouldn't allow us!  The waitress and service was spot on! She was always attentive and recommended drinks and buffet food to try out. Also, if you haven't seen a particular meat come out for a while, she can get the server to bring the meat around.   Next time we come to Vegas, we're definitely coming here again!"}
{"text":"If you purchase the VIP package in the month of March it's unbeatable! If you don't and only go once a year, it's still unbeatable, just don't ask me to limit my visits to that few! Best place ever!"}
{"text":"Not even sure where to start! I guess I should start with join there email so you get $25 off. Especially if it's your birthday they will email you a coupon to show to your host.  The salad bar is more like a what should I not eat or try. There is even a nice five pounds of bacon on a plate to put on your salad. There is four different kinds of soup.   As of for the meat all that you can stand. Pork, beef, chicken, and lamb. Some with bacon wrapped some not. My favorite is the lamb. And I usually don't eat lamb. The flavoring of the lamb chops is perfect. I was able to devour 25. I was told the record is 31. Try to beat it! That's a lot of meat."}
{"text":"The food is very good and the atmosphere is nice, but what stands out here is the customer service. Matthew was one of the best service staff people that I have ever experienced. His knowledge of the Brazilian concept and suggestive pairings was spot on all night. This is a place to go for a special occasion as they make you the center of attention. Most all the meats had unique flavors and there is plenty to find at the salad bar too. Save room for their large choices of dessert too."}
{"text":"** VERY IMPORTANT **  It would have been an amazing experience. My boyfriend talked highly of this place up until we came together recently for the first time. Most of the meats kind of fell a little short, some were dry and tough. Some were bland. The people going around with the sticks would ask everyone on the table if they wanted the meat because obviously just because one person doesn't want it doesn't mean the other one wouldn't either. They'd ask my boyfriend first and when he said no they wouldn't even bother to ask me and would just leave.  I did like the mashed potatoes I guess, it was good. Servers should also always mention that desserts cost extra. I mean that could be our fault for not realizing but it should something to mention.   The thing that really ruined the experience was that our tab said $87 but they took $102 off my boyfriend's card. I realized it's 20% so I'm guessing they automatically take the tip but it should always be written on the tab. It should say our total is $102 with the 20% tip instead of just $87. When we asked them about it they said it was a problem with our card company?? Like that doesn't even make sense. I tried to ask on yelp if they automatically take the tip off and my question got deleted because \"it was talking negatively\" about the restaurant.  We messed up and accidentally left our card on the tab the second time and when we asked our server, she just stared at us and kept cleaning. Everyone left the restaurant and we just stayed sitting there.  We were alone with the workers cleaning and still waiting until maybe 15 minutes later we ask her again and she finally got it. I feel like she just didn't understand the first time but she shouldn't have acted like she did. Should could have just asked us to repeat what we said.   I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service. Meat is always fresh and delicious. Salad bar has a bit of everything. 10/10"}
{"text":"Very disappointed, I had to complain before I saw one additional item beef ribs came out first time in the whole evening of dining. I hope they will curtail any additional items removed."}
{"text":"Texas de Brazil has become one of my family and friends favorite places to go for dinner. This past weekend I made reservations for a party of 15 with the help of the Manager ( I believe his name was Mike ). When we arrived the table was ready and waiting for us at 7:45. The salad bar was stocked full with great choices of fresh foods. The meats were all amazing, I like my food cooked a little longer and they are very accommodating to that fact. Our server was Ryan and he was very informative and fun for our entire group.   My only complaint was the bathroom situation. I'm positive they did not do a bathroom check for the two hours we spent there. There was toilet paper and fecal matter all over every stall but one. It's a Saturday night, I understand they are busy but this needs addressed. I'm disappointed in the ladies that left it in such disarray."}
{"text":"Our first time here and we loved it the hostess quickly greeted us as we walked through the door we waited 45 min since we were walk ins and as we barely sit down our server Pedro got our drinks and helped us start our meal. Its something that everyone should experience at least once but as for us we will be going back!!!"}
{"text":"no complaints. first time coming here may 30, 2015. it was a slow friday or saturday afternoon. clean, quiet, pricy but its worth. restroom clean. paid $120 for two people .....dessert! the bomb"}
{"text":"Food: excellent Service: excellent Value: a bit pricey, but most things in Vegas are. Recommend to a friend? Absolutely!  BUT, the TAMPA location has terrible service. We won't go back there."}
{"text":"Come on guys no free soft drink refills !!!!! I would have given you 5 stars since your Brazilian BBQ is the best I've ever tasted. In Las Vegas  But at this day and age softdrinks should not be an Upsale I think is very greedy, not cool at all."}
{"text":"We have eaten here about once a month for the past 2 years. Lately it has gotten worse and worse. There were 8 + employees on the floor, all talking to each. Even the managers were talking. We only got half of the meat choices that we normally receive. The meat was dry and not fresh. The salad bar looked old. I even had to pick out the wilted slimy salad, left it on the counter hoping that they would notice. The soup was not hot. It took 10 minutes for someone to ask for my drink order. I didn't bother to complain because I won't be back. There are plenty of GREAT places to eat in Vegas. I am giving 2 stars because it was clean."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying im not a big meat person but i have always wanted to try this place. All you can eat meats, who wouldn't. The variety of meats they offer varies from pork, steaks, chicken and lamb.   We were able to experience so many types of meats, cuts and flavors. The filet mignon was extremely tender, lamb chops with mint sauce full of flavor, bacon wrapped chicken definite delight, pork sausage cooked just right and the variety of extra sides at the salad bar was an overload of goodness.   Our server Amanda was amazing as well. She was attentive, personable and when we requested a certain meat she was quick to have it sent to our table. She was so polite, for instance she would ask permission to pour more sangria instead of just assuming we wanted more. She also used a splashguard while pouring. Now I know that's a standard in most restaurants but not followed all the time. Her recommendations were well taken.  Favorites: lamb chops, shrimp salad and filet."}
{"text":"The price for all you can eat is really good.  The service is always great.  Sometimes the meat is really salty.  The beef ribs are the best."}
{"text":"I struggled with this review because although I really wanted to love my time here, I was just annoyed more than anything. Before I tell you about my time here I'd like everyone to be aware they sell 2 $50 gift cards at Costco for $80, $20 savings! So, We came with a group of 6 & had to wait about 15-20 to be seated although we had a reservation. The place is EXTREMELY loud and very hard to have a decent conversation. In my opinion the tables are way too close together. In our 2 hours there my purse fell off my chair from people walking passed about 5-6 times. As far as food goes however the meats were excellent. Almost all their meat is cooked at medium rare-medium but they did offer to bring anyone's meat back to be cooked more if they wished for no pink.  There is a wide array of sides and appetizers to go along with every meat. While I did not like my drink (Tito sunrise) my friends sangria was delicious! Def. recommend. Good food? Yes. Would I go back? Ehhh...def. not on a Saturday."}
{"text":"meat maet i love meat"}
{"text":"Excellent food, meat is so tender if falls apart. Salad bar was great! The service was very friendly and on top of things! Great for a date night or a family event!"}
{"text":"I have always wanted to go here but I haven't been able to find somebody to go. Today I went with my son. The meat was amazing and all the servers made sure to accommodate that I prefer medium Well to Well Done meat. The cheese balls as appetizers were good. The salad bar was fresh really like the prosciutto and the bread. The fried sugary bananas where amazing. I finalize my meal with a creme brulee even though the server said it wasn't their best it was really good."}
{"text":"What a beautiful restaurant with delicious food and the meats were to die for.  I was always fearful of Brazilian steakhouses but this one was tops.  The sides were offered buffet style and there are sooo many delicious cold and hot sides that you can get full on just that.  Then the parade of meat came and it was glorious.  Frenched lamb chops, house sirloin, chicken, beef ribs, pork ribs, sausages.  I was deliciously overwhelmed!  The service was exceptional.  They not only keep coming around but they even ask if you have favourited that they will bring in higher frequency.  I wish we had this place in Canada but I definitely have a food coma so I think I am good to dream of this place until I return again to Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place rarely disappoints. It's a lot of food, that just doesn't stop. It's also pricey, so be sure to come hungry and get your fill. I personally love the massive salad bar. There are many fresh and delicious options. You can just have the salad bar, but unless you are a vegetarian, why would you? The meat options are nearly endless, and simply seasoned which makes them all so good. Everything is excellent,  with the exception of their desserts. I never care for their desserts and think they must be brought in from an outside vendor. They don't taste fresh made and never leave me satisfied. The only downside for a local, is it is located in a very touristy area. We still go several times a year because it is so good overall."}
{"text":"Best meat and service ever! Vance is amazing!! Next time I'll definitely ask for him again."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Extremely good meat. Salad bar a little wanting. Lobster bisque was the soup -- delicious if a bit salty.   Tip: get the menu with all of the meats and plan ahead. Don't accept whatever is offered. Pace yourself. Suggest you try the Brazilian picahna, filet with bacon, lamb chops and beef spare ribs.  Meat is all buttery soft and perfectly prepared. I love the picahna and the filets were tender and juicy. Food was hot (temperature not spice) which can be a risk when theyre walking around with it like that. The parmesian encrusted pork was a little dry for me, but the beauty of this place is that you can set it aside and go for something else. The lamb chops were incredible; I normally avoid lamb (gamey in my opinion) but acquiesced after my friend insisted--glad I did.   My guest had a few drinks and I stuck to water. Total bill with generous tip $200. Worth it. Didn't eat for 24 hour after that meal. I will be back."}
{"text":"Too. Much. Meat.  I'm a meat person. I'll pick that over pasta any day, but this is waaaaaay too much. I guess you know that going into it. Very salty! Overpriced for what you can honestly consume. I was not well for days. A friend just did the salad bar option and even that with a drink was a crazy bill.  Service was good so I guess that's a plus."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with Texas de Brazil... I was here for my friends birthday and again this place never disappoints me! Of course my favorite beef ribs... You have to ask for it to come around because that is everyone's favorite and it takes forever to get to you.   It had been a while that I've been here, but it just remind me I have to come back soon."}
{"text":"We had reservations at 7:45pm.. Here's 8:01pm and we are still waiting to be seated. What's the point on making a reservation when you have to wait to be called while the whole time I see people that came in after us and have been seated before us. Disappointing. This is why we like to go to Via Brasil better. We only came here because we have friends in town from Reno. Way to go on putting on a first impression. Customer service is not the greatest at the front.   I will update after dinner with service.  I give the waiter and people who come around with the meats a solid 5 stars but the hostess' a 1... They're just terrible with keeping their reservations."}
{"text":"After giving up on the staff at Joe's Crab Shack for my father's birthday dinner (for some reason he likes it there, why, I don't know), my family settled on trying Texas de Brazil based on some initial feedback we had received from a friend and the sheer smell of meat radiating across the plaza.  The wife and I had an OK previous experience at Green Forest, but unfortunately, Texas de Brazil left us rather dissatisfied with the entire evening.  Following a rather disorganized seating process (the hostess more or less insisted we head to the bar to wait, but no sooner did we get there and attempt to order drinks, two separate servers tried to come seat us), we were sat at a table.  We waited an easy 5-10 minutes before anyone even came to the table.  Once our server arrived, he more or less just said to go grab our food (we still hadn't received water at this point), at which time, we interjected that two of our guests would be getting the lite dinner option (which he immediately became disgruntled and attempted to insist that they get the full dinner - go figure, the meals were $20 cheaper).  Throughout the evening, we only received one refill on water even though our glasses were consistently empty.  Also, while it seemed there were a wide variety of meats to be enjoyed, the same 3-4 options kept being brought to the table (on our way out, I noticed 3 different meats that never even made it to our table to try).  In addition, the cheese bread, potatoes, and bananas all went un-replenished once the first set was eaten.  After a certain point, we simply decided we wanted to cut our losses and leave the restaurant (but we couldn't, as the server couldn't be found to ask for the check - we had to ask a gaucho to find him for us).  The final straw in our experience was the fact that we were charged 18% gratuity for what has been the worse service we've received year to date in Pittsburgh.  This is why I don't let family pick restaurants for celebratory dinners.  For the $43 + tax/gratuity per person that we had to drop on this bucket, I could of easily taken them to any of the best-in-class joints the burgh has to offer.  What a waste."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite place. I came here during the soft opening when it first opened up and have been a loyal customer. But the last two times here have been a complete disaster!!  My cousin and I waited about 20 min even though we already had a reservation, eh, no problem. We sat down and had the first round of meats then we didn't see anyone for 15 min, I mean NO ONE, not our waiter or any carvers! Our waiter came by and I told him the issue a few minutes later 2 carvers stopped by then nothing again for 15 min and this was a slow day according to our waiter and 2 carvers. The waiter apologized and mentioned it to the manager which I believe is the GM cause I remember him when it first opened up. I asked to speak to the manager since I had to wave down carvers and the manger didn't come to talk to me. The waiter apologized again and pointed him out to me to talk to him on the way out. We had the VIP card which is always returned to us by a manager once they stamp it and come thank you for being a regular VIP customer, again he avoided us and had the waiter bring us the card back. To top it off he has the nerve to look me in the eye and walk away into the kitchen area when he saw us walk toward him. I waited a few minutes and just left.  The food is good if you actually have carvers who know what you like and make sure they visit the table regularly but the service has been horrible!!!! I cancelled having a birthday dinner there for this disrespect!"}
{"text":"Make sure you wear your fat pants! You will leave here stuffed and ready for a nap. I haven't been here in awhile because of how pricey it is, but my boyfriend had his work party here the other night so it was time to give the place another try. I have to say, that I do really enjoy their food choices. I love meat, but don't eat it that often as I stick to poultry and seafood, but it was a nice change and all the meats I tried were delicious. The salad bar was ok. They had a lot of cheese and meat choices and a few different salads. It wasn't a huge selection, but it was more than enough to fill my plate, not leaving any room for when the guys with the meat came around. lol The filet mignon wrapped in bacon was one of the best options, in my opinion. The sausage was really good too. Good think about Brazilian steakhouses is that you get to try a big variety of different meats and usually can't go wrong with any of them. We tried some of the desserts after dinner, even though I don't think anybody really had room for them and they were ok. I got the cheesecake, but I wasn't really impressed. I kind of wish I would've gotten something different. The problem I did have was the service. We had a private room with about 12 of us so we weren't a super large group, but every time I asked for something, I had to ask multiple times because he kept forgetting about me. By the time everybody else was done, I still haven't received anything I asked for and ended up getting it after I was done. The service was definitely disappointing."}
{"text":"Loved it. Plan on coming back. Good price for the style of place it is. Liked our waiter Matthew and plan to ask for him when we go again"}
{"text":"Had an amazing lunch, the meat cooked perfect including lamb. I hope next time they have chicken hearts as well!"}
{"text":"Went I a whim with my boyfriend because our other plans had fell thru and it was a blessing in disguise. Can in on a Friday night at about 8 and got seated in 30 minutes and it's well worth the wait. Michelle was our waiter and was great. He answered all questions and accompanied us however he could. There were 12 meats and all were delicious. The prim rib was the best but all were tasty. Coming in you know it's expensive but it felt like it was worth it because we were stuffed and I had nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"Meats are always fresh and delicious.And their salad buffet is amazing also.Servers are kind and good thing is all you can eat."}
{"text":"Great service and yummy food!  I don't eat pork but one of their meat selections had chicken wrapped in bacon.  However they willingly offered to prepare the same entree without bacon just for me...Loved the special treatment!!!  Great salad bar too!  You will leave completely satisfied if you come here.  Just go!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great. My family is from Brazil and we really enjoy visiting this place. It is fun to take others as well. This place is good for larger groups, call ahead, they can accommodate but they're always packed, even on weekdays. The wait is never long. We love coming. We always get caipirinhas to drink! It's a Brazilian staple drink. The \"salad bar\" is insane, it isn't your typical American salad bar. It has over 60 items and has much more food variety in it! The featured soup was lobster bisque when we went. Delicious!! If you love meat, this is the place for you. You pay $45 a person and it's all you can eat \"salad bar\", and meats. They have different types of steak, lamb, sausages, chicken and much more!! We will be back again and again! We have been here many times. Try the picahna, it's the best meat they offer!! My family always makes it. High quality place, good place for special occasions."}
{"text":"This is a carnivores delight!  You absolutely cannot go wrong with this delicious diamond. The atmosphere is upscale, but not pretentious.  Nice bar area and excellent, attentive service from start to finish.  Diners of all ages from 2-60+ dressed in shorts to business attire.  This is not a quiet, intimate place, but very cool to impress a date and definitely celebrate.  They were serving 15 different meats, including sirloin, pork, sausage and chicken (I'm forgetting a few).  They will keep it coming, so remember to use your meat tabs (green for more, red to pass).  The meat is tender and seasoned perfect.  If you want it well, they are happy to oblige and they take requests.  The salad bar has a vast assortment of items to please every palate.  Salads, cheese, meats, fruit...a good variety.  They had lobster bisque (very rich and creamy) and some excellent au gratin potatoes.  They serve each table mashed potatoes and fried bananas.  I saw the desert selections.  Though we did not partake, they looked amazing.  How do you leave?  Stuffed!!  I suggest reservations because it gets busy.  Dinner is $49.99 a person.  $24.99 for salad bar only.  $5 for kids under 6 and 1/2 price 6-12 year olds.  They honor military, law enforcement and teachers with 20% off (have your ID with you).  Enjoy this gem of a dining experience."}
{"text":"Definitely a unique experience. You flip your token to green and the servers will bring you more kinds of meats than you can imagine, all freshly cooked and carved right onto your plate. Ribs, bacon wrapped filet mignon, sirloin, everything. Flip the token to red to stop. There's a huge bar of sides, and you should definitely help yourself generously so you're not gorging yourself on meat alone. There was a lobster bisque that I absolutely loved. The only reason why I didn't give them 5 stars is because the meat is super salty."}
{"text":"Alls I can say is bring your appetite. It's a never ending meat train. The place is clean and loads of choices. Not of the pork,chicken,lamb,beef was bad.salad and soup bar was great loved the lobster bisque. Great selection of whiskey. The 10 year old scotch was tasteful. Bring you wallet it's about 100.00 per couple but so so so worth it"}
{"text":"Celebrating mom's Birthday!!!  Mouth-watering all u can eat meat however they mostly served medium & I prefer my meat in a well done side, don't want bloody juice in my steak. Salad is phenomenal, lobster bisque sooo good & u dipped in warm moist cheese bread bites. The"}
{"text":"We came here with some friends, and this place has something for everyone. And it's so delicious!   If you've never been to a Brazilian steakhouse, here's a quick guide: 1. Sit down and order something to drink 2. Go up to the salad bar as many times as you like 3. Flip your meat card from red to green until you can't eat anymore assortments of meat that are being walked around for you to choose from. 4. Once you can't eat another bite, flip your card to red and order dessert.   If you're not a meat person, they do have the option for someone to just do the salad bar for half the price.  I love this salad bar, it's worth coming here just for that, but I try to pace myself knowing the meats are next. The salad bar has a wide variety of different salads, vegetables, cheeses, sushi, salamis, etc.   Meats from chicken, to pork, to steak, all cooked appropriately. Red meats are from medium to medium rare. Everything tasted wonderful, especially the ones wrapped in bacon.   Please note: this meal could easily last you two days of never wanting to see food again."}
{"text":"As always we are never let down by Texas de Brazil. We have been here a dozen plus times and never once have we been disappointed. In fact we made the mistake of wanting to try a different place to celebrate my husband's birthday and we still ended up here (the other place had an emergency maintenance shut down). The food is always great,.And the cost to value I feel is worth it. My drinks have always been tasty. The salad bar is phenomenal and if I wasn't such a carnivore I would happily just eat the quinoa salad and frejoles (might have spelled that incorrectly) to my heart's content. Fortunately I do love me some deliciously cooked meat on swords so this place is a win.  Tonight's meal was one of the best we have had there.  Everything was cooked perfectly and seemed to have a hint more flavor to it. Even the lamb chops (i hate lamb) were magical. Heaven on earth.   I also love that this place is semi casual. I mean no one looks slovenly, but if you dress up or not, it's ok. My husband HATES dressing up. So I'm happy to get presentable out of him.  Soo thanks to not having a fancy dress policy.   I know it's virtually impossible to save ton for dessert, but the carrot cake is one of the best I've ever had. No raisins. To go. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm! Oh how I love love love this place! I come here to celebrate eating! Especially meat!  I love their little buffet with cold and hot stuff to accompany your meats! That rib meat is to die for!!!! So juicy and full of flavor! Mmmmm! My mouth just salivates thinking of it!  The sirloin is good too as well as the sausages and chicken. Nice occasional treat!"}
{"text":"My second time here,  the service was perfect and the meat selection amazing.  One of the best Brazilian grills around and I've been to many."}
{"text":"Went with my aunt and cousin while they were in town and I was blown away.  Fantastic food and excellent service.  Literally every bite of food I put in my mouth was delicious.  It is pricy but great for a super special dinner out."}
{"text":"The waitress was very friendly and engaging however, this is the second time that we experienced over cooked white meat.  The chicken and pork offerings were extremely dry however I recommend the flank steak and lamb chops as they were very nicely cooked.  Overall customer service at this location was at a lower level than other Texas De Brazil locations we have visited across the country.   Typically the staff is very welcoming and the manager comes around to visit with customers and inquire about their experience.  We felt very rushed through our meal and during this visit the GM was very curt with us when we inquired about our final bill.   I recommend visiting this location during their off-peak times as the customer service has been better on a week night."}
{"text":"Great time & excellent ambience, service, & food. We'll def return for dates & celebrations. Love, love, love our server, Kelly, I think her name was. Gracious & prompt. So grateful to know her. I had so much food that at the end of the evening, I felt like I had a baby cow, lamb, & chicken in my belly"}
{"text":"Great selection of meat.  Salad bar is pretty good too.  Service is acceptable.  Walk-ins usually end up with long wait times.  Main complaint has nothing to do with the food.  Seriously, what kind of \"high-end\" establishment doesn't have guest wifi?  AT&T data signal inside the restaurant is weak to non-existent."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best restaurants in the Cleveland area.  My family and I have tried other brazilian based steakhouses and by far Texas de Brazil was the best.  The food was very similar, but we could tell that quality was their main concern.  What sets Texas de Brazil apart was the service staff!!  The five stars are handed directly to the staff.  The individuals employed here take their job very seriously and made the experience and our dinner remarkable.  The manager was extremely attentative and approached us numerous times to assure we were being serviced properly.  Our waiter Damian deserves a round of applause for making my family feel as if we were the only guests that evening.  Must try this location for just the service alone."}
{"text":"We came here last night for dinner. We had reservations so we were able to get seated when at least half of our party arrived. The restaurant was packed!  If you haven't had Brazilian steakhouses before, this is an all you can eat type. You have a paper circle...green for bring me the meat! Red for please stop, I have the meat sweats.   The salad bar had a lot of options so it's hard to not stack up on that. You want to try everything but you also want to save room for all the meats.   They also bring you fried bananas, mashed potatoes, and cheese rolls. Fried bananas were amazing!!! Not like what we have had before. It's not rolled in dough, more so covered in sugar. We got multiple dishes of it. Lobster bisque from the salad bar was a standout as well. Not too heavy on the seafood smell and very buttery.   LOTS OF MEAT! The second you turned that circle green, it was a bit overwhelming with how fast they come at you and ask you if you want certain cuts. If they didn't bring something you wanted or you missed them, you can always requests for the cut. Standouts for meat would be the sausage and the filet. All of the meat was well marinated and incredibly tender.   Great place! Be prepared to eat a lot. We would be back for special occasions but not an every month type of place for us."}
{"text":"Not the best tasting meat. Too salty. Definetely a fun experience with co workers, but being a fogo de chao obsessor, it was hard for me to completely enjoy this meal. It was $50 a person, so come very hungry that's for sure! By meh for me, probably won't be back"}
{"text":"Everything was amazing. All you can eat. Try the platano (banana)! Dinner is worth the price!"}
{"text":"Great if you're a meat lover Very fancy, nice place especially for a special ocassion they have an amazing salad bar w lobster bisque other seafood choices and amazing scalloped potatoes for example for those who are not huge on meat for just the salad bar option is half price.  They would've got 5 stars from me except they handed the bill for 16 people to one person instead of splitting the check and asking us from the beginning who's w who to make the check out a lot easier.  Other then that the staff is exceptional very polite very accommodating and will refill your ice water w/o asking. They have a big staff which makes it so you never have to call the waiter for anything, there is multiple waiters coming to your table w diff kinda of meat less then every 5 min thank you! Food is delicious and they have a rewards program:)"}
{"text":"Always such a great time here! The service is amazing they really do pay attention to their customers they offer discounts and $20 off certain holidays and birthdays! Such great quality food it's a little pricy but so worth it with it being you eat as much as you can stomach! Be careful with the card they give you because once you turn it green it's over lol be prepared for a lot of food coming your way!! We will be back very soon !!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for a few years or so now. I am a carnivore and a half, so churrascaria is right up my alley. My card stays green until I tap out because although I love the options, I am particular to the ones I eat. I especially love, LOVE, love the special house sirloin.   On the regular, I am not a sirloin kindza girl... but here, omg!! It's a must!! The charred trim of fat is just a burst of flavors to accompany the tender meat party in my mouth. My second favorite meat is I believe the flank steak. It is so tender and juicy. I rarely try the other meats TBH lol. As far as the salad bar, I usually fux with everything there, but at Texas De Brazil, it's hard for me to eat too much of it because then I'll get full too fast lol. I do love the mushrooms to accompany my steaks, grilled pineapples, and lobster bisque.   We also enjoy the plantains and cheese rolls that come out. The mashed potatoes are good too. Service has been nothing but great thus far. Wine options are very broad. There's definitely something to pair with all the meats served here. I usually go for a CabSauv to satiate my palate when I am eating the meats here.   You bet we are coming back for more!!"}
{"text":"We really enjoy Texas de Brazil.  We went on a Sunday night and the restaurant was somewhat busy but did not seem loud or crowded.  The salad bar was quite tasty, I especially enjoy the grilled provolone cheese and salad with Brazilian dressing.  Even the croutons, enormous \"bacon bits\" and marinated tomatoes were delicious.  We tried the au gratin potatoes but they were a little rich for us.  The meats are phenomenal.  My favorite which apparently is the least popular, is the spicy Brazilian sausage.  Be sure not to miss it.  The flank steak and sirloin cuts were impeccably seasoned and cooked to a perfect medium rare.  Filet mignon is well filet mignon, lol.  We don't care as much for the chicken or pork because they have a tendency to be a little dry.  Our server, the manager, and most of the gauchos were super attentive and friendly.  A few of the gauchos could smile a little more, just FYI.  Overall A+"}
{"text":"The food was delicious! So much to choose from! The salad bar was very fresh. Honestly though if is wasn't for MARINA I think my wife and I would have been less impressed. Service is great she took care of us!   Plenty of parking and casual attire."}
{"text":"Delicious, great service.   4 stars because the wait for a table took over 15 minutes even with a reservation."}
{"text":"The food and service were outstanding.  I have been to churascarias in Brazil as well as the popular chain Fogo de Chao in the U.S., and this place is every bit as good.  The servers were very attentive.  The wine and cocktails were great.  The salad bar includes veggies, fine cheeses, and appetizers like shrimp, sushi, and salmon.  The churascaria is outstanding - gaucho style grilled meats served table side in portions.  The best ones were the Picanha NY strip, the bacon wrapped filet, the parmesan pork, and the sirloin.  The manager came by the table twice to check on things.  We were here on a Friday night without a reservation and left very happy and quite full."}
{"text":"Consistent in outstanding service and great meats! The bacon wrapped jalapeños were a perfect accompaniment to all the meats! I'll come back every time I visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here after they opened a few weeks ago. The interior is beautiful, the staff is very friendly. We've been going to another similar establishment in downtown Cleveland for years for special occasions, we will never go back there! Texas de Brazil is closer, and the salad bar and quality of meats were WAY better.  I highly recommend the Potatoes Au Gratin on the salad bar, I couldn't stop eating them! The salad bar is very nice, well worth the price, the dressings are delicious and the huge wheel of shaved Grana Padano cheese, and the basket of perfectly cooked bacon just took it over the top, I almost wanted to eat nothing but that! I have absolutely no complaints about the food, all the meats were delicious and moist. Especially the steaks, the salt rub they put on them is so good!   My only complaint was the overbearing service. There's a fine line between taking care of a guest and making them feel smothered. Every time I left the table, my napkin was refolded, and the waiter physically handed it to me to put it back on my lap, it felt silly. My water was filled about 8 times, which felt like every time I took a sip it was refilled. Our waiter was always hovering/circling around us, I think we were his only table, and we were visited by two separate managers to see how things were.   Just a little privacy would've been nice, the meals are already understandably invasive with the gauchos coming with the meat selection, I'm expecting that and I'm okay with that, but when my husband and I didn't even have 2 minutes alone it's just a bit much. Maybe this was the case because we were there at 5 on a Sunday and they were slow, so they were bored, maybe when it's busier it's less intrusive. It's much better than being ignored by a server obviously, but maybe just take it down a notch. Despite all that I'll definitely be back, and not just for special occasions :)"}
{"text":"We went expecting the high prices. You're paying for the experience. Food was great, and service was great. We got our bill and we were charged for refills on soda. This is very disappointing, especially because we were never told that refills were not included. Drinks are served in a wine style glass too, and they were being refilled before they were even empty. You would think that when you're paying 55 a person plus cost of drinks, that refills were included. We had a $1,000 bill from our table, and $100 of it was strictly refills. Seems a little extreme. It would have been nice if they would have let us know that those were extra every time they filled the glass. Seems kind of a dis honest move to get every little dollar. Should have at least been given the option."}
{"text":"If you are a steak lover then this is the place for you! I suggest you try their creme brûlée  and mango lemonade. However, it is quite pricey but if you have a big appetite this place will be worth it."}
{"text":"ya to bad before punching the price through the roof it was fine . now terrible service and the scam type of don't give em the good stuff yet is typical in there . ill pass. last month i had a plate full of fat and grizzle leftovers ."}
{"text":"My husband, my 3 year old daughter and I went here last night to celebrate my birthday. The service that we received was exceptional! Marina waited on us hand and foot. She recommended the best cocktails and dessert for us to try. She is bursting with personality and is the definition of true \"customer service\". The food was out of this world and worth the price that we paid. Overall, we had a 5 star experience and will be returning."}
{"text":"Nothing amazing really. Mashed tasted like they were made from a box. Au gratin was very cold. Bisque tasted to much like sherry. A lot of the meats were really good though! Beef ribs awesome! Key lime pie was disappointing. 4 star review because I left my card and they called me 3 minutes later! Great guest service!  2 guests 2 dinners 2 glasses of Chardonnay 1 dessert.$170 yikes..."}
{"text":"This is a fun place to eat, although it does not have as many authentic Brazilian dishes as Green Forest.  The price seems reasonable, given the amount of food.  They made a big deal out of telling us to turn over the medallion to the red side if you did not want additional meat brought to your table, however they kept bringing the meat anyway.  It's just a had place to have serious or quiet conversation, there are a lot of interruptions.  I loved the marvelous cheeses on the salad bar.  The meat was cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"First time at a Brazilian restaurant. Server Marcos was outstanding, we never sat with an empty drink. The food was literally some of the best I've ever had. A little pricey, but well worth it. Everyone we encountered was friendly."}
{"text":"My friends and family were here for dinner on a Friday night. Recommend making a reservation on their site. We were a group of 9. We got seated quickly. The waiter we had was awesome the whole night, quick and attentive service and super friendly, helpful and informative with all his recommendations.  As for the dinner service, it was $50 a person. (Dessert not included) The salad bar was pretty standard self serve. My personal favorite option was the Lobster Bisque, tastes great. The meat selection was ridiculous in a good way. Every selection of the meats on the skewer swords looked mouth watering! I tried pretty much most of the meats offered for dinner.  My personal favorites: -Braised Beef Ribs -Bacon Wrapped Filet Mignon -Brazilian Sausage  -Flank Steak  -Brazilian Picanha  Overall, the experience here at the Vegas location was a good one. High quality cuts and high quality tasting meats! I would come back again here in Vegas or the California location only if the service is just as good. Texas de Brazil is one of the better Churrascaria Steakhouse's I have been to."}
{"text":"It was my first time at this location and it was nice to be on he water and the surrounding area was beautiful. The vibe in the restaurant was okay, it wasn't very busy and our wait time was much shorter than anticipated.  It seemed like the employees were not very happy to be there but that could be because we were there during restaurant week. I will be returning for sure, and I will update accordingly!"}
{"text":"Really unhappy with the service. We were \"blamed\" for moving tables when we got here (which we didn't do but even if we did...) and then almost got into a fight with the manager about the mistake they made on the bill.  Never got refills of water and waited 40 mins for a glass of wine.  I'm also certain that if we hadn't been here our friends of color would have been treated even worse.  Expensive place to be treated poorly."}
{"text":"Service I give this place one star. Horrible service at check in with reservations waitress for a table over 20 minutes past our reservation time.   I went to the bar for a drink and it was mostly empty there I know why it was like pulling teeth to get service. I waited over 15 minutes for one of  the three bartenders to poor a glass of wine.   Our waiter was the only saving grace to this poor service experience. He was actually very good and prompt and extremely apologetic for the the service we had receive prior to his arrival. The food was good plenty of items on buffet/salad bar area. The food was fresh and constantly being put out and well displayed. The Brazilian BBQ was good with lots of meats always coming around. I'd say the leg of lamb was the best on the menu. Dessert was goods the chocolate cake was very well done. I was wasn't a fan of the cheesecake it was way too sweet. I would have given this place a solid 4 stars if the hostess and bar service would have not been so poor."}
{"text":"This place was amazing came here after my last day of my work convention. The servers amazing. They pair the wine perfectly. Will be back here!"}
{"text":"Amazing as always!  Booked a private room for @ 16 people on Thursday the 24 for my daughters high school graduation.  Texas de Brazil has always been our favorite place to celebrate occasions but this was just so much better being in a private room. I wish I could remember our servers name. He was fantastic!!!  He said he's been there for quite a few years. He was joking with everyone and just really did a wonderful job.  Hope he gets some praise for how well he does. He's really friendly and personable.  Thanks Texas de Brazil for doing what you do!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed.. I understand that is a busy Saturday night, my server she was very nice but it took 15 minutes to bring me my beverage and another 5 before I leave received my potatoes.. I didn't even use the salad bar as nothing appealed to me.. the way the commercial I seen described it was that the salmon was hot.. but I can't eat cold salmon.. except when it's in sushi.. so bottom line..here our my 2 complaints  1. Should have an option for people that don't use the salad bar because me paying $45 and not have anything appealing to me on the salad bar is a waste..I understand you can't please everyone but at least have the option to have a cheaper dinner without the salad bar..  2. My server was nice but not timely as of me writing this since she brought my drink last it has been 14 minutes and haven't heard a peep.. (yes I am writing this as I'm in the restaurant)  As for the food.. (salad bar I didn't see anything appealing to me your results may vary)  All the cuts of meat that I've had have been very good.. but I have only had 5 cuts (lamp chop, parmesan chicken, filet wrapped in bacon and beef rib)  of I believe 7?..   Over all if you use the salad bar it's worth it but if you don't like me it's not worth the premium price"}
{"text":"From past visits I would give this restaurant 5 stars, but not on my last visit. My father made reservations for the family for my birthday. We even got a call the day of to confirm our reservation. When we arrived, we gave them our name and they looked at us with a blank look and said they did not have our reservation. I showed her the call back number and the hostess really didn't seem to care. Not the best way to start my celebration. After waiting, we were given the table right behind the hostess stand, so forget atmosphere. I felt every breeze that came in when the doors opened. Our service was ok, we had to ask for refills, and sat some time waiting for the meats to come by our table. We ordered dessert, no candle to celebrate. My guess was the waiter was never told. Even though it was mentioned when making the reservation and when we arrived. Overall the food was good, but very much a lack of customer service."}
{"text":"Honestly wanted to give this place a 4-star rating, but in the end decided against it. As like many of restaurants of its type, there are two options: either full bar or salad bar only. Though most people who come here would probably find this place pretty dope in terms of a relatively plentiful selection of meats, salad bar offerings, service, and whatnot, I was a bit dismayed to find that the salad bar was a bit lacking in terms of fresh fruits/veggies options goes. So many carbs, so many oily options ... didn't really help my conscience that I was eating a bunch of meat as well (though I don't exactly come here for that very reason). Otherwise, great place to come to in terms that steakhouses go. Be warned that parking can be a bit annoying since it's in Station Square, which tends to be a bit more expensive parking-wise if you don't have validated parking (for those who work there) or leased parking."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to Texas de Brazil and must say this place is FANTASTIC!! The food was AMAZING and the server Sean was simply the best i waited for nothing he was totally on the ball. I was comparing Texas de Brazil to Brasa....... and blow Brasa away easily."}
{"text":"Are here for restaurant week so it was a great deal, $35 for dinner including dessert. I think the key is to know a bit of what you want before going in, otherwise you'll get full too fast! The salad bar is good but not amazing so I would save room for the meat. My fav was the flank steak, super juicy and flavorful. The filet mignon medallions was cooked well and very tender. My boyfriend loved the lamb chops and the leg of lamb. We skipped trying any chicken or pork, so I can't comment on those. If there are particular meats you like, you can let your server know and they will make sure it comes to you table.   Drinks were good, the caipirinha was delicious - closest to a shaken margarita. And the key lime pie after was delicious! The only negative is sometimes there was significant wait before meats circulated, especially if they run out before getting to your table and you have to wait for the next batch. I'll probably be back again for lunch since it's cheaper, or for a special occasion."}
{"text":"My family and I showed up with a party of (7). Our waiter was extremely good. The meat part was excellent and our waiter did a great job asking us if we got want we wanted and if there was anything specific we wanted.   We got (2) of the Cabernet which was good and reasonably priced.   The salad bar I thought was lacking a little but I didn't come for that.   The dessert was great. We got (4) different types to share.   The experience was great. We were there for (3) hours and no complaints. I went home full and happy."}
{"text":"This place was great. Lots of meat, wonderful salad bar and great service. Need I say more ... go and enjoy.  PS. But only for lunch when the prices are reasonable"}
{"text":"Always my favorite place to eat. Food is amazing and so filling. The $5 drink special was to die for and our waitress was hilarious and on it. Just wish that host staff was a little nicer. Came in earlier than our reservation for my bfs birthday and staff was a little rude. Just because we had a reservation and came in early they were sitting walk ins before us instead of just sitting us and giving our reservation to someone else. Only reason not 5 stars was because of the host staff but otherwise amazing as always."}
{"text":"The greatest restaurant in the entire world. every year, for the man trip to vegas, we always meet up here. I come here every chance I get, the house sirloin and the bacon wrapped filet are the best. just don't eat for a few days ahead of going. trust me."}
{"text":"Food was amazing.  Service was excellent.  Hannah was our server and she treated us very well for our first time here and celebrating our anniversary.  The part that was not good was the corporate policy and the inability of the manager to make things better.  We were given a gift card to celebrate here.  We also qualified for a \"heroes \" discount for my wife being a teacher.  At time to pay the bill we were told that we could not use a discount they advertise and the gift card that was given to us, that someone paid for.  The explanation from the manager was that it was a corporate policy.  I kindly asked for the corporate number or regional manager information rather than try to make things right, he said there is nothing he can do.  I told him to take off the discount that his company deems warranted for teachers and use the gift card someone bought already and that we would not bring outer business back.  He simply tells me okay and does it.  It is a shame because it could have been a special place to celebrate birthdays and anniversaries and other special events.  It is a shame when corporate decisions cost your business customers for the long term."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my dinner but wasn't hungry enough to get my money's worth. $45 per person is ok when you eat a lot. The salad bar was smaller than the other steakhouse I went to but it was pretty good. The meat was good. I enjoyed everything but the flank steak. The sausage, parmesan chicken and lamb chops were my favorites. The bananas they give you to cleanse your palate are delicious so were the beans and rice and scalloped potatoes. The lobster bisque was outstanding!"}
{"text":"We just got home from dinner, everything was amazing! The salad bar was a great start, a lot of options to choose from. I also was very impressed at how clean and organized it was kept throughout the evening. Our servers name was Fernando and he was fantastic! He stayed on top of our drink refills and always made sure the clutter from the table was removed.  The meat carvers were all so friendly and came around very quickly. The meats ranged from top sirloin, flank steak, chicken, lamb chops and legs, bacon wrapped filet minion and some other varieties.  It was my moms birthday and they gave her a complimentary dessert, they offered creme brûlée, carrot cake, chocolate cake, cheesecake, and key lime pie. We opted for the cheesecake for her, they wrote happy birthday on her plate in chocolate and raspberry syrup.  All in all the dinner was wonderful, I would highly recommend Texas de Brazil."}
{"text":"I first was introduced to this restaurant when living in Fort Worth Texas for a year. I loved this place! It's a Brazilian churrascaria  which really means it's a Brazilian cowboy barbecue. Sounds simple enough but it's better!!!  This is an all you can eat monster meat bonanza like nothing you have experienced before unless you've eaten here. It's an all you can eat buffet but here's the twist... servers walk around with sword like skewers full of the best cuts of meat cooked to perfection. You have a little disk you flip over from red for no I'm good to green which is load me up with meat. This is the highlight of this wonderful place to eat. That isn't to take away from the salad bar which has many great items itself such as the prosciutto or the awesome cheeses. Did I also mention that yes they also have a full service bar that is spot on!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere - 4/5 Food - 4/5 Price - 4/5  -- make sure you know how much yer paying BEFORE ya get there. It can be pricy if you don't anticipate it! Noise - 3/5  This place is easily one of the most attentive dinner services I've ever been to. Water was never low and they straight up said, if we had any special requests such as degree of doneness for any meat, they'd be happy to prepare specially for us. I was there for my brother's birthday and they even stored the ice cream cake for us.   For anyone who doesn't know how a brazilian steakhouse works, they carry around skewers of meat and serve you as long as your individual card is face up and green (or red for no). Usually, everything is included in one flat fee but that also includes a sides bar. Stuff there like spicy shrimp, palm hearts, lobster bisque, there's a lot there for ya to get for one flat fee. Granted, it might be a little of an expensive fee but after you dine, you can buy a VIP card for $60 which gives you 12 50% off dinners until September. We bought a couple of those too since we'll definitely be going back.  We had a party of 10 way in the back near the kitchen. For some reason, the chairs here were hard plastic instead of wood like the other decor. Not to mention it was a little loud because the window for the kitchen was an armslength away from the back of my chair. It was a little unsettling to be so far away but we did get most of the meats fresh out of the kitchen due to our proximity (ha).   The only critique I had was that for my flavor palate, the meat was leaning on being too salty -- no matter what the cut was. They said they only seasoned it with salt but man sometimes it was a little overwhelming.  Compared to Brasa (Downtown Cleveland) and Rodizio (Arena District, Columbus), I think Texas de Brazil is probably my favorite. It feels nice to be taken care of that well in a restaurant."}
{"text":"This is the best I've ever been to. My family is from Brasil and absolutely loves this place! We are going again this week. The service is perfect as well! Deffinately recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good but when you flip the card they were bringing it non stop. Fill up the plates too quickly. Also did not have time to enjoy your meat. Server was good also. I would not go back"}
{"text":"Spend all of your dollars here. Seriously. The food was so good, I literally ate myself sick (my family laughed as I took a lap as a breather).   Admittedly, I didn't spend a lot of time on side dishes but the sauteed mushrooms, prosciutto, and fresh mozzarella were all very tasty. The lobster bisque was also on point, but I'm not sure if that was a nightly special or a common place.   On to the meat, don't waste your time with chicken. It's not because its not good, but seriously with that much freshly grilled steak flying your way, why waste time (and valuable stomach space)  Highlights were the sirloin, flank, and bacon wrapped filet. The sausages were surprisingly good and the pork ribs were extremely tender and delicious. Cooked to perfection.   Thiago, our waiter was very nice and humble. We had a really great conversation, he took very good care of us, and we really liked his company. A+"}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday and was pretty excited because I love the Texas De Brazil in Fort Worth, TX. Well I told them how I like my meat cooked, but they never once got it right. The meat was either overcooked or undercooked. I am giving a 3 because the salad bar was great and our waiter did try to fix the issue. Don't think I'll come back."}
{"text":"Update : the manager I reported this incident to has never contacted us back"}
{"text":"You need to prepare yourself before having dinner here, you need a big appetite for sure! They have an amazing 50-item salad bar which has the most amazing and buttery lobster bisque soup! Definitely recommend dipping the house cheese bread balls into the soup. Your meal also comes with mashed potatoes and a cinnamon sugar plantain to cleanse the palette in between courses.  Our favorites were the bacon wrapped chicken, chicken wings, and sausages!  For dessert, we had the orange/sugar creme brûlée and Brazilian cheesecake which is a fudge/caramel cheesecake."}
{"text":"This is a special occasion place that is basically it's own form of a modern buffet crossover.   You must go hungry.  I'll say the real reason is the cost.   Wow, I never expected dinner for two to be $115 before tip.   The dinner is $42 pp before beverages.   Come with an appetite.    The food was decent but for the cost I left a bit jaded.  The lobster bisque was basically broth... Good tasting broth (either someone else looted all the lobster bits or there weren't any to begin with).   Selections at the \"salad bar\" we're fair but geared for those of you who love veggies.  I liked (not loved) the meat selection.  They bring all sorts of cuts around.   The choices were ok.  Nothing crazy different or mind blowing.   Some was somewhat too raw and chewy.  Others were more medium well.    Service was decent.  Again with the buffet-ish style our waiter only had to run drink orders (but with how many tables she had I had an empty glass a few times)."}
{"text":"Had dinner at this place last night for Bryan's b-day and it was so good. To start with we brought the little man who I think was more excited about daddy's birthday then daddy was. When we arrived we were seated next to there wine cellar that is glassed in which created for the funniest moment of the night but ill get to that in a min. We started with the buffet which was very fresh but didn't have the largest selection which is ok with me because I would rather fill up on meat but I have to say I love beets with goat cheese and they had both so I was in heaven even before the steak. The meat for the most part was great. They prepaid it medium rare but will cook it however you like. As well if you find it to salty which I did not you can ask for it with no salt. The filet just melted in my mouth. This night they had top rib meat which I can't think of the technical name for but it was very fatty and after getting it on my plate I decided I would pass. I also have to compliment the meat guys they were all so good with my son as well as the rest of the wait staff. So many times while being out I've felt like restaurant staff have just dismissed him but I can't think of a single time when my son said something to a waiter or server that they didn't stop and acknowledge him. Now I will leave you with this. If siting by the glass wine seller keep your kids close because mine decided he wanted to check it out and ran right into the glass. Bryan and I laughed so hard. He didn't get hurt or anything and I don't think the table next to us even saw it but it was hilarious. This place is great for the whole family and the meat is amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Walked in on a sunday afternoon and was blown away! The presentation and explanation of everything was very thorough and the server did not pass any detail, was very helpful and patient. You turn over a red circle to present a green circle which signals the servers walking around with meat to stop by you table and offer you some meat. Immediately when we turned our circle over, we were bombarded by servers. A bit shocked to be honest, but the house special sirloin was amazing.  Some of the servers would come even when you circle was red, but it wasnt the end of the world. I would say the food itself was not enough for the price, but with the presentation and experience was definitely worth it. Planning to visit this place when i come back to Vegas!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place!! We will definitely be coming back again. The salad bar and the desert were my favorites."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and service impeccable! A little bit away from the strip but definitely worth it!!"}
{"text":"Our last trip to Texas de Brazil (about a month ago) was absolutely horrendous...Claudio was 'working' as out server for the night.  He is by far the worst server My wife and I have ever dealt with after living 20+ years in Las Vegas at any restaurant.  You name it, he would mess it up.   So today we return and who do we get as out sever? Yep, Claudio....we asked to be reseated so we could get away from him.  Service was better, but could tell they were trying to make up for last time.   The food today was the problem...I kept asking for medium and getting rare.  Most of the time the same cuts of meat were coming around and finally had to ask for a specific thing.  By that time it was too late.  We will never go back to eat here due to bad service/food."}
{"text":"We were sat in a too small table that was in the middle of a main isle. It felt like the table was just placed there to make more room. As soon as we were shown our table we immediately asked for another table and were told by the hostess that all the 4 tops surrounding us had reservations for 4 coming and and they couldn't place us anywhere else. We should have just left because that was just the beginning of a let down night. With a table as such, every tom dick and harry was buzzing by our table from both sides and we constantly felt the breeze and it always felt like someone was going to bump into us. It wasn't relaxing to say the least. The table was so small, i could not even place my purse anywhere, even hanging from my knee so eventually just ate with it in my lap. The most disappointing part of this dinner was that all the tables that were empty when we came in were all eventually filled with couples of 2 dining. After the third couple was seated at a bigger table I said something to our waitress. She apologized but said she couldn't do anything. The food was good albeit everything was a little too rare for me and we had to wait longer for meats that were medium. We had a super tough time trying to get our bill and we asked the manager twice to see if he could get it for us, which he did get the second time...that is actually understandable as they were very busy. I think the lies and bad seating has me convinced not to go back though. At 50.00 a head to start with, I can get a much better atmosphere than feeling like im going to get knocked off my chair by passerbyers/meat servers every 60 seconds"}
{"text":"We like this place. First time we tried this chain was in Columbus Ohio. Since then we visited our chagrin location several times. Very good for big groups and kids. Service is always good. My only complaint is how salty the meat is. By the way you can ask your waiter for food to be less salty which they gladly accommodate"}
{"text":"Texas De Brazil is a delicious meat extravaganza. But, beyond meat, they have a wonderful salad/antipasto/hot foods bar! Everything in the bar is super fresh and high quality! Definitely try the bacon from the bar as well as the artichokes and manchego cheese. If you want a yummy bar combination, wrap some of the creamy goat cheese with a thin salty slice of prosciutto. Excellent service and selection!"}
{"text":"Great service makes all the difference at a rodizio - and  if you are able to request Damion - you'll be sure to have a great night. I'd read reviews that raved about him and we just got him by accident - and learned that the reviews were right!  He helped us make our drink choices - and - when something came to the table a little bit wrong -- he comp'ed the 'mistake' and brought us a completely perfect replacement. Both were delicious and we started the night with a great cachasa buzz.   Damion ensured that the cuts of meat we preferred were rotated through our table constantly. I am partial to the lamb chops, the pichana and the bacon-wrapped filets - and the recommended flank steak was also delicious. The salad bar has a fully chilled selection and everything was well prepared. The sautéed mushrooms stood out as well as the fried bananas.   If you sign up on their website they'll send you coupons - which make a great night even better, The value is definitely there - with our without the coupon - and the service was top notch,"}
{"text":"This is the 100th time I've eaten here! I absolutely love this Resteraunt. All other steak houses fail in comparison to quantity, Quality and flavor... oh and price. My husband and I frequent this location and have never had any bad experience. It's always super clean and the staff is friendly. The waits can be sooo long though. Especially when the VIP cards are about to expire. It's a must try."}
{"text":"The food here is always consistent, and the menu rarely changes.  Great selection of meats to try and fall in love with.  Large salad bar with pretty good lobster bisque (especially for a non-seafood place).  The food is always good here, and  the service is excellent. The family loves coming here once a month or so.  The downside is that it's a little pricey, especially if you don't eat/can't eat a lot of meat."}
{"text":"This is the best steakhouse I have ever eaten at. The service is great and the food is top notch. The salad bar is on another level. Great selection and high quality. The fried bananas served to clear your palette between cuts of meet are a delicious treat. I would recommend this place to anyone who loves meat!"}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of dining at this facility on July 2, 2016, it was phenomenal! The food was outstanding the service was exemplary! My family and I will return again, and again. I definitely recommend this restaurant; go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"We found this restaurant via Open Table while in Cleveland.   My husband lived in Brazil for quite a few years and we love the Brazilian cuisine.     The meats were seasoned to perfection and the Farofa was genuine and prepared as it is in Brazil.  Service was attentive and we enjoyed speaking with the manager who knew quite a bit about Brazil.  Thanks for an amazing evening."}
{"text":"Food was great, but the service was amazing. Vance was the best server we've ever had here! His personality makes dinner even more entertaining.  Move over Fogo ... We may have a new favorite for Churrasco!"}
{"text":"The food is always good here no matter which location you go to.  On our last visit we were with a fairly large group of about 16 people.  They sat us in a small room, which should have been good for a group.  However, it seemed like we were kinda forgotten at the back of the restaurant.  Also, the place is so noisy that I could barely visit with the person sitting next to me."}
{"text":"Man--if you haven't had the meat sweats at least once in your lifetime, you haven't lived!  I mean, come on folks--we are talking about sweatin' into the oldies but goodies here!  Filet, lamb, bacon wrapped EVERY DAMN THING, ribeye, ribs, you name it, I think they got it!  At first I was all like, \" hhmmm, not bad for a steak house.  I wonder what all the fuss is about?\".  But then the greeter--who happened to also be our waitress AND the bartender--took us to our seat.  She gave us the shpiel, took our drink order, and told us to help ourselves to the \"salad area\".  By the time we got back to our seats, she had already brought us our off-the-chain drinks--the house special made even more \"special\" just because she was cool like that-- and had even arranged to have the first meat-man come to our table!  (I apologize in advance if the term \"meat-man\" offends but honestly I don't care).  This meat-man brought some of the finest tasting filet I've ever graced my taste buds with.  I honestly think my taste buds smacked the inside of my mouth at least twice for food so damn good.  And the meat-men just kept coming, and coming, and coming.  It wasn't until after my first round of the meat sweats did I realize my disc was still on green!!  I quickly turned it to red and waited out the first meat sweat episode!  By the time it was all said and done, my wife and I gobbled so much meat we could have fed our family for the next three days.  I was very proud of my petite little wife!  I think she consumed more meat than some of the big dudes there!  Wow!  This was our first time going and I can honestly say that it will NOT be our last!  The place was fantastic!"}
{"text":"This place is the typical \"de Brazil\" in Vegas. Has to fill up on drinks at the bar before my meal since they don't offer MOST of the bar menu at the table. And they don't offer happy hour at the table. So basically if you want to drink you literally have to leave your table, order and wait for your drink, then walk all the way back without spilling it just to enjoy I don't know, a rum and coke.  But maybe that's my alcoholism talking.   Regardless the meats are good, the sides were amazing, and it's a cool concept I've always liked about de Brazil."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a lover of red meat but I had the best meal of my life here. Highly recommend the filet mignon and the chocolate cake. Came here on September 22 to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. Our server Loan was phenomenal and made my first time here amazing. I only give it 4 stars because the hostess was rude and stand offish. I have worked in dining as well and that's not a good first impression and doesn't make guests feel very welcome. No greeting, no smile, and very unpleasant. If I wasn't celebrating something special I would've chosen somewhere else to eat. Other than the hostess, the rest of the service and the food made up for the bad first impression."}
{"text":"I have the restaurant 3 stars because it was amazing service, the buffet was clean and well organized and our waitress was very helpful the buffet had fresh cheeses, sliced meats, vegetables and your average salad bar. They also had a hot section with three choices, rice beans and cheesy potatoes. I would say if your a meat lover this place is for you, the samples are small but you can ask for more. The meat to me and my family seemed a bit salty. We went through so many waters at dinner because of how salty the meat was. There was a lot of options but I don't think it's worth the price. It was a fun experience but honestly just a glorified buffet. I've had better steaks and meat elsewhere."}
{"text":"An experience indeed!  Have you ever heard of a Churrascaria? Me either! Well, there are no menus... just a tremendous \"salad\" bar for $25. If u want meat,  all the tableside carved meat you can eat, I think it's $45.  I can't quite explain the variety, but the variety is... incredible!  You will enjoy it... if you have the palate for enjoyability ( is that a word anyway)?  Take a couple hours to enjoy yourself ....enjoy the food... enjoy the great service ....enjoy the nice environment and enjoy an evening out at a really cool place!   Tell Pam the bartender, my girl ..  I said \" what's up \" ...she is the bomb... fa real, deal!  Yep it's that simple, well no... not really...yeah it is!  Oh, check both doors before walking away. .. the left was locked and the right was stuck ...surely they'll work that out before you get there!"}
{"text":"THANK YOU Alex!  If Alex is your \"Server\" you are in excellent hands! He is from Brazil!! (I asked :)). He was our server last couple times we dined at Texas De Brazil, he offers excellent service, very caring and ON TOP of it! Always have a smile which is very pleasant. Took a friend there, made a booking through open table to avoid a long wait. Meat was amazing like usual, salad bar needed some refill (it was 9pm) We had a great diner and time with friends! My friend was amazed by the quality of the meat, Brazilian sausage, beef on the bone, filet Mignon, chicken Parmesan, lamb leg, lamb chop, sirloin and much more. Meat lovers you will be pleased I put 4 stars because of the noise. When it's packed, it's VERY NOISY and almost impossible to have a conversation :-/ Would be so nice for Texas de Brazil to do something about it!"}
{"text":"Great food! Thank you Suellen & the \" meat men\" for your excellent service! The salad bar was delicious & fresh. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My go to place when I want to bring family, friends, or if I want to impress someone. Definetly come here when you are super hungry."}
{"text":"I have to say this is the only place which impressed to the highest level when I first went there, very unique way of serving food and different from Pittsburgh style!  we have become a fan and after the first time we have been 5 or 6 times and everything is always very impressive!  But there is some things that could be improved and what I noticed is when you go there past 7 you won't get too many choices of meat and most of your meat will be a little burned and even fired bananas and mashed potatoes looked like they were left overs.  every time you go for 2 people you will end up spending a little over 100$ for sure and when you do that you want decent food on the table!  overall, I took my friends there, I always recommend people to go there, we love it!"}
{"text":"My favorite steak place in vegas! Id spend every birthday here if i could! My favorites are the sirloin and bacon wrapped filet mignon!"}
{"text":"I would give this place quadruple the stars if I could. Absolutely blown away by everything about this restaurant! This is the kind of food and experience you want when you come to Vegas. Well worth the wait (definitely make reservations) and our server and staff was outstanding!  My only regret is not coming more hungry. I recommend trying a Caipirinha (Brazilian Cocktail)...so darn good. A must stop place next time you're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This is the restaurant that was chosen for our annual day after Christmas family dinner.  Value: Very pricey, but worth it. Beware of happy hour drink specials though, not every drink is discounted, i.e. gin and tonic was $10 and price of wine was very high.  Ambience: Upscale, very crowded, best make a reservation. Place is clean but lighting is VERY dim.  Food Highlights: Salad bar items were plentiful, fresh and delicious. The lamb chops were the bomb at medium rare perfection, some of THEEE best ever and so was the Brazilian Picanha. Didn't know sirloin could get that good. Filet Mignon, meh. Leg of lamb was tasty.  Service: Service was on point and awesome...until the checks arrived. Took about 1/2 hour to sort out check errors, including one that was $30 plus dollars off and NOT in our favor. Thus the four star rating.  After eating here be prepared to be stuffed for hours if not for days!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times,  today, by myself and waited 20 minutes to be seated. Seated, asked for water/lemon. Still waiting. Full~ done eating, and another server brings the mashed potatoes/plantain. I'm the only one sitting at the table, he sets it on the other side of the table. Daaaaa for me to stand up to get. Original waiter comes back: Me~ are you new Him~ oh no, about 3 months now Me~ is there some reason another waiter JUST BROUGHT THIS and set it on the other side of the table  Him~ I don't know ~~ smiles then moves them closer. HOWEVER~ A CO~WORKER and his wife and child came in, sitting right in front of me, and they are catering to him as if he owned TEXAS D~BRAZIL  I TOLD HIM 3 TIMES DO NOT TAKE PLATES, I'm STILL EATING ~~ HE COMES AND TOUCHES MY PLATE TO TAKE IT I SAID, ARE YOU IN A HURRY FOR ME TO LEAVE, TAKE IT, TAKE IT ALL, HE THEN LEAVES IT, AND BRINGS ANOTHER PLATE ~ but leaves the food I was eating  IM BOILING HE comes again, can't I get you something as he sees me writing this,  I said yes, the manager Managers as a rule, walk around and ask you twice, is everything okay...he had to go find this one.  Manager Andre Silva comes over and I tell him what happened. He laughed when I said I'm still waiting for the lemon...really, umm I didn't see anything funny So he says let me clear these plates and get you another... Yah know,  I totally lost my appetite now...NO thank you, I'm done. Few minutes later he comes over trying to BRIBE ME with a desert....NO thank you 3 times before he took it away.  Asked another waiter can I please just get my check so I can leave...wait...wait...manager brings it, put card in it and wait some more. Asked another to ring me out, he calls the manager ~~ oh I'm just going to charge you for the salad.  I thinking I do care what you charge me, I just want OUT of here.  Paid my bill, left a $2.00 tip, and left.  So disappointed.  About to make something to eat, and go to bed...... They USED TO BE GOOD, going downhill I guess....."}
{"text":"Note: A reservation isn't needed but I highly recommend getting a reservation as this place is always packed.   My family and I had reservations here at 7:15pm on Father's Day and it was very jam packed in there. It's $50 a person and it's basically a buffet and there are servers walking around telling you what meat it is and how it's prepared (filet mignon medium rare). As you are seated each one of you are given a card which you can flip over. The green side of the card means you're ready for more meat so the servers will come to you, while the red side means you're not ready for more and so the servers won't come to you. There are also other servers that don't carve the meat but instead check up on you and will give you a new plate if they see your plate is getting messy or if you're done with it. Considering it was Father's Day I didn't expect such a great service and coordination from the workers, but they really worked as a team. I tried a majority of the meat they carved and my favorite had to be the filet mignon, but you can't go wrong with any of their meats. As for the buffet section I LOVED their mushrooms and their potato salad. However if you want to get your moneys worth don't be a fool like me and eat all the carb heavy foods like the potato salad, mashed potatoes, cheese bread, and fried bananas. They have a wide variety of alcoholic beverages but the only downside was that I ordered two Midori sours and it was about $15 which is quite expensive as I've been to other high end restaurants with Midori sours that were only a fraction of the cost. Overall this place really does deserve 5 stars because the whole restaurant works as a team, servers were very attentive even on Father's Day, and the meat and food was prepared perfectly. Definitely a great place for to go to for any holiday or an occasion like Father's Day which also happened to be my dads birthday."}
{"text":"Hands down a restaurant with stellar service!! Let's start there before we even talk about the food. I felt like I was VIP and that is really something special.  You  aren't made to feel like you are inconveniencing the staff. Whatever training is done here needs to be done at so many places.   Cool concept if you've never been to one. Salad bar and meats galore. I wish I'd remember all the times and took pictures but we were too hungry!"}
{"text":"The food was well cooked and a good collection of meat. However, the waitress was obnoxious and the service was just poor. Had a rough time getting any service and had to wait for long periods to get any attention. It wasn't even busy."}
{"text":"Went last night with my financee (our 1st time), and we loved it.  The 'salad bar' was amazing.   So many great meats & cheeses.  And the meats were awesome.  Others have complained that it was too salty.  Of the 10 or so meats I tried, 1 (maybe 2) were salty, but I still liked `em. True, it is a bit pricey, but I was worth it.  Also, our service was great too!"}
{"text":"Best Brazilian steakhouse in town.  Nurses, militaries, police officers, EMTs & teachers can get 20 % discount anytime. Been here several times"}
{"text":"I went here on Tuesday night, first time.  I mean it was ok, not the best restaurant I have visited , I didn't like that fact I had to get up and serve myself like a buffet for 50 dollars a head I would have appreciated  my food being served to me but other than that it was good,  The meat was very tender and the lobster bisque soup, absolutely wonderful. Its not on my list to return but hey you never know :)"}
{"text":"Texas de Brazil is a total experience, one that first blew my mind in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where I was too sick to eat but watched in amazement as men carried around huge slabs of meat and brought it directly to the table. I regretted missing it so much, that I was ecstatic to discover that two northeast Ohio locations had opened recently.   I chose to go to Woodmere, as it was closer, and decided to treat my boyfriend for his birthday. And when I say treat, I mean treat, because I spent a good 150 dollars between the two of us.   The Woodmere location has excellent service, with the manager, our waiter, and gauchos coming around frequently and always with a smile.   Everyone was knowledgeable, with the appreciated touch of suggesting food and alcohol pairings. Even more, the vibe of the place was relaxed, which is hard to pull off with at least four people weaving through tables at all times and a self-serve buffet.   Still, the food leaves some to be desired. While the dessert was so deliciously prepared to perfection, the meat struggled with consistency. Our waiter told us the meat would be prepared medium rare, and some pieces were, while others were given an inedible char. There could probably be more options for cuts and preparations of meats as well.   However, the experience felt special and the food dynamics of it all (using cinnamon sugar fried plantains to cleanse the palate, for example) were all incredibly effective. I'd suggest coming here if you want to try something new and are willing to splurge for an upscale feeling."}
{"text":"The food is excellent. I really enjoyed the garlic sirloin and the fresh salad bar. The service was good, but I did feel I was being rushed. I was immediately served meat as soon as I arrived from the salad bar.  I would have preferred being able to enjoy my salad before having meat served on top. Overall it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Loved the food it was delicious , services was perfect ! One thing I dislike was not very much options for kids . I made reservations and still had to wait . Besides that it was good ."}
{"text":"Ok we took one star due to meats seasoning. Yes they tell you about use of salt but every single piece is to salty. People with hypertension and CHF needs to stay away from here. Also 15 before we left it was when we saw some cuts of meats advertised but not served until we were done eating. No ribs at all. Josh was excellent with service.  Outstanding salad bar."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!! Nice atmosphere, you can dress casual or dressy. The salad bar was unbelievable, a nice variety of salads and I wanted to try everything. Now on to the meats...it was so delicious and flavorful. It just keeps coming. The service was also great. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I've been to several other TdBs in other states, as well as other places like Brasas here in Cleveland and Fogo de Chao. I was honestly very disappointed by my visit to this location of Texas de Brazil. Normally at establishments like this I have to fend off an endless stream of servers coming almost constantly table side to deliver their delicious meats. Here my friend and I found ourselves sitting and fiddling our thumbs waiting for servers to return. We often found ourselves waiting to have our water refilled. My friend had to remind the server twice to bring him a new Coca-Cola. We chose the Creme Brûlée and Flan as desert options, they were average at best. Overall I have had better experiences at other locations of this same chain. Hopefully the service improves over the next few months.  The salad bar was very good, I think if I ever do return to this location I may stick with just that option."}
{"text":"I don't usually give 5 stars but this place is off the charts, not only is it all you can eat meat, just the experience of men walking around with swords of meat ready to serve you felt pretty awesome. You must go to know what it's all about, and they are very tentative to your table from the time you flip the green card till you leave. The taste of every meat that you try is super delish and give you fried banana so you can clean your pallet so you can taste all the different flavors of every meat. Two thumbs up for this place"}
{"text":"I walked in with reservations and was seated quickly. I was greeted by some of the friendliest faces I've seen in town.  The restaurant was bustling with people and the bar area was full with NFL Football fans. The food was delicious and everything was so fresh. I loved the variety of items at the salad and hot food bars. I really appreciated the fact that everything was always being replenished. The two ladies who were our servers were so sweet. They made some really great suggestions. I loved the beef ribs. When I couldn't find them anymore I was devastated. But to my rescue, my server was able to ask some fine gentlemen to bring some over for our table. That was fantastic!! I swear, those beef ribs are life changingly delicious.   I couldn't imagine how in the world I was going to be able to consume my $50 worth of meat and sides but I noticed that if you sign up for their email based club online, before your visit, you will receive a $25 off coupon. I know, for a fact, that I would not be dining here too often if anytime real soon. So, I signed up and thought that it would be the perfect opportunity to use that voucher for my meal. So, I ended up paying about $25 for my dinner, before taxes, drinks, tip, etc. That was definitely helpful in making it feel more affordable."}
{"text":"I've been to the Texas De Brazil in Aruba several times so we were excited to see one open in Pittsburgh. In Aruba, the service is exceptional, but I always assumed it was because we were at a tourist destination. The service at the Pittsburgh restaurant was also really great, which was a wonderful surprise. The staff would ask us often if there were any meats we were looking to try and would make sure a server with that meat stopped by our table. They also gave us tips on what sauces from the salad bar worked well with the meats. Our server that refilled our water, took our dirty plates, and handled our check, however, was not very good. He barely checked on us and we went a good 20 minutes with empty water glasses and when you're eating a lot of salty meats, that water is a must! He also acted really put-off by the fact that we asked for a split check since we were dining with another couple, which I thought was strange.  The meats are usually rare to medium, but you can ask for well done. There's a good variety of beef, chicken, pork, lamb, and sausage. My favorites were the garlic medallion steak and the Parmesan pork. They also serve fried bananas and mashed potatoes as side dishes for each table. In aruba, they serve fried plantains, which we liked better, but I guess if you're in the US they opt for banana. It was still good though. You can't really go wrong with a banana fried in cinnamon and sugar.  The salad bar has a great variety and also serves non-salad bar items like sushi. If you go with a group, you can opt to get just the salad bar and no meat for a reduced price.   My biggest complaint with the Pittsburgh location is they crammed way too many tables into the dining room. You're bumping into people non stop. They really need to remove some of the tables so that people can move around better and not feel cramped."}
{"text":"Delicious food and excellent wait staff. The Groucho's know what they are doing and the meat is perfect every time. The salad bar is fantastic and expansive. I have to say that my favorite items are the unbelievable lobster bisque and the Brazilian cheesy bread. All that said, there are better chuscarria (sp?) restaurants in town that do it even better. There are also worse ones so of the about 5 in town I've been to this one rates second."}
{"text":"We had party of 20 there.  This is one of the best places to have large party.  Everyone's food comes out when they want.  The wood smoked meat was really good tasty. The salad bar was amazing soups , salad, seafood and cheese. The ambiance was amazing the staff is on point.  The only reason they did not get five stars is never had creme brulee cold and the rest of deserts seemed just ok."}
{"text":"My daughters 13th birthday dinner.  It was a hit from the hostess to the bar to the server and managers checking in on us.   Amazing staff.  The food was amazing everyone and there was 12 of us.  Loved it including the vegetarian who grazed at salad bar."}
{"text":"One of the best Brazilian steakhouses. You like meat? This is the place for you. I thought the garlic sirloin was the best choice out of them all. They also offer a healthy sized salad bar for all those that don't necessarily eat meat but the veggies choices are fairly lacking - don't bring any vegetarians to a Brazilian steakhouse four sure. Also the desert is also fairly good - the Brazilian cheesecake was amazing. I would come back here again."}
{"text":"Went here for my significant others good friends birthday and it was OK. Pricey for those who are looking for a good place to pay for good food. A tad bit too much salt, but delicious."}
{"text":"This my very first Brazilian Steakhouse experience. I admit that I don't completely get the concept (almost feel guilty for the sheer amount of food they bring by), but the food is delicious. The leg of lamb was perfectly tender and seasoned just right, easily my favorite of the night. I wasn't a huge fan of the chicken or sausage, but everything else was superb. Service was spot on, interested enough to ensure you're cared for while allowing you to enjoy your meal. The salad bar is exceptional, everything was fresh and well presented. My only knock on this was the lobster bisque wasn't hot. It wasn't exactly cold, but it was just warm...not the most appetizing for how much the wait staff raved on it, but it was tasty. Easy 4 stars."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW!!!! I came here tonight to celebrate my bday with my husband and we were blown away by this place!! Fantastic food, drinks, ambiance, servers, and boy are they generous!! When we got seated the host asked us if we were celebrating anything special, we told him and he said he would take good care of us...they sure did!! Our server Maria was amazingly attentive, kind, and very knowledgeable of the restaurant. There are 17 meat styles to choose from including beef, lamb, and chicken and they come NONSTOP along with mashed potatoes and fried plantains! The salad bar had so many selections like meats, cheeses, salads, rice, potatoes, and the best lobster bisque soup I've ever had! We had banana fosters cake for dessert which they gave us for free along with $20 off! Yes, this place is a little pricey at $45/person plus drinks, but it's well worth it for a gray night out!!! Go now!!!!!"}
{"text":"The server we had was amazing. I had a bottle of Saratoga water and they would never let my glass get half empty. The food was amazing. The salad area had a lot of great things that you wouldn't find on a normal salad bar. The cinnamon bananas were so good. Of course, the meat was incredible. Eat every kind that they offer you and get seconds on both types of lamb. I highly recommend eating here. You will feel like royalty."}
{"text":"Texas de Brazil is a feast for the eyes as well as the taste buds. Great ambience, great service and best of all what's not to love about skewered meat? There are several cuts to choose from, but my favorites definitely are; the signature sirloin called the \"Picanha\" -- a slab of NY strip with that delicious strip of fat on top, the flank steak, and the beef rib (elusive, it doesn't come out often, but I have my eye out for it, trust me).   You can't go wrong with any of the other cuts: pork ribs, chicken parmesan, parmesan pork, tenderloin, lamb leg, lamb chops, bacon-wrapped chicken, garlic sirloin, filet mignon, bacon-wrapped filet, sausage... man the options are endless. I'd say millions, even billions. Believe me. All well-seasoned, fresh-tasting and delicious.  Then there's the salad bar which also doubles as a side dish station, if the mashed potatoes and candied plantains they set on the table are not enough. You can come in and just go for this salad bar without the meat, but why?! Ok, maybe if you hate yourself... That's also cool.  This is eat-all-you-can. I was impressed by the other patrons who ate like champion competitive eaters, but disappointingly, I gave up after one plate. I was defeated. Next time, I ought to channel my inner boa constrictor and bring stretchy pants. Challenge accepted."}
{"text":"After anxiously awaiting a new brazilian churrascaria, Hubs and I made reservations at TDB for restaurant week. The special was their typical buffet and meats with a dessert option or 35$. It was actually a pretty good deal and ened up saving us $30 total. Upon walking in, I was blown away by he size of this place. Gigantic. It was also very busy as there was a late aftenoon private game that had just ended. I'm glad we made reservations seeing there was an hour and a half wait!  We were quickly seated and the server helped us pick out a glass of wine. We were given a small bread basket with round, cheesy bread balls and were instructed to help ourselves to the appetizer buffet. The buffet has a selection of prepared salads, some seafood, meats and cheeses as well as greens/veggies to make a salad. After a quick salad, I was ready for the good stuff-the meats! Our server brought over our wine as well as fresh plates, a side of fried bananas to cleanse the palate and mashed potatoes. We turned our coaster to green and anxiously waited . . . and waited . . . and waited. We saw several skewers of meat come out of the kitchen but then they retuned to the kitchen area empty without coming anywhere near our table. I'm not sure if they didn't realize that we were waiting or if it was tso busy that they didn't make it to our table before running out but we missed many tasty looking meats. Our server stopped by to ask how it was going noticing our plates were empty. I explained the situation and within two minutes, the meat was exiting the kitchen in the opposite direction and headed toward our table. We tried the filet, ribs, lamb chops, leg of lamb, skirt steak, sirloin steak, rotisserie chicken, chicken wraped in bacon, parmesan crusted pork loin (my favorite) and plenty more. We lost track after 12 different meats. After having our fill, we both chose the banana foster pie for dessert. It too was so tasty and delicious. We left our meal feeling very pleased with the overall experience. My only criticism is that our other favorite churrascaria  (Green Forest) has a better appetizer buffet with a bigger selection of seafood items."}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about this restaurant.  The food was made to perfection.  Come hungry because the food NEVER stops until you \"tap out\".   The wait staff was near anytime something was needed. Anthony( our server) was personable and precise.   The cost almost kept us away however we decided to go for our special occasion which takes me back to my first sentence."}
{"text":"Amazing. Amazing salad bar, Amazing lobster bisque, Amazing table side selections, Amazing variety of never-ending skewered meats served table side. Amazing service. Oh yes - Amazing deserts. WARNING: Do not eat breakfast or lunch before you dine here!"}
{"text":"Took my dad for his birthday here since he's never been and since he's a major carnivore; definitely had to put my vegetarian on the side today for my dad lol. Located in the Town Square shopping center and across from Look Style Society, very easy to get to and has it's own parking spot.There was a bit of a wait, not too long, about 20 minutes on Friday, Labor Day Weekend so that's pretty good. But I made reservations earlier for 8pm, which I think is the best way to go. Came here for Dinner at $49.99/person which included unlimited salad bar and unlimited meats! The salad bar had tons of options! My favorites were the Lobster Bisque of course, and the Potatoes Gratin. I also saw a variety of cheeses, deli meats, curried cauliflower, all types of salads with quinoa, beans, and your typical toppings with romaine lettuce, grilled veggies, mushrooms, smoked salmon, shrimp, breads, etc. Pretty amazing but don't get too filled up on all of that since at your table you get unlimited meats coming around! If you've never been here, they have little coasters on the table, one per person, with one side green and one side red. If you want meat, you flip it to the green side, and if you need a little break or if you've decided to throw in the towel, you flip it to the red side! When it's green, they have servers that walk by your table, each with a large skewers of a different style of meat and you tell them how many pieces your want! The options from what I can remember were Filet Mignon, Top Sirloin (The infamous Picanha- the FAVE at our table), Lambs Chop, Parmesan Pork/Chicken, Bacon wrapped Filet, Pork Ribs, Flank Steak, and Brazilian Sausage! Phew! Tons of meat options! Then if you're still not full, or if you suddenly get a second stomach like me right when dessert comes, they have a lot of great options as well! Brazilian Cheesecake, Crème Brûlée, Brazilian Flan, Chocolate Mousse Cake, Bananas Foster Pie, Key Lime Pie, Carrot Cake, Pecan Pie, Brazilian Papaya Cream, and Coconut Pie. They brought the dessert tray out and I wanted to try basically everything especially the Crème Brûlée, Flan, and Papaya Cream but decided to go with the Carrot since it's my dad's favorite. So this carrot cake is pretty amazing. It doesn't have raisins in it and it has a coconut element to it so just that makes it an A in my book but on top of that it was super fluffy and moist and wasn't too sweet. I mean it was sweet definitely but it wasn't that artificial, loaded with powdered sugar type of sweetness. Perfect way to end the meal! Even though I don't eat meat often nowadays, on meat days, this is a definite contender especially if it's a special occasion. Yum! I'll be back! (In Arnold voice lmao) :)"}
{"text":"This is the best Brazilian Steakhouse in Vegas that I have tried.  From the ambience to the waitstaff to the food, everything is 5/5 in my opinion.    It is 50 dollars for all you can eat.  They have a pretty wide variety of side dishes in the buffet to choose from including:  soup, salad, lobster bisque, a variety of deli meats, sushi, greens, veggies, rice, potatoes, cheese, and a whole lot more.  You leave a double sided saucer on your table on either green (meaning you want meat) or red (meaning you are done for the moment eating meat) and servers come around with a variety of meats that they slice for you off of the bone.  Off the top of my head they came around with different sausages, filet mignon, bacon wrapped chicken and steak, pork, flank steak, chicken parm, and a few more.  All of it was absolutely delicious.    The ambience is a lot of fun and it's a great place to come celebrate or start the night out with friends!"}
{"text":"Texas de Brazil is 110% worth the money! If you have never been here, your next high roller date needs to be here!

You are given a disc with one red and one green side. Flip the card to green when you need more food, and the servers will literally bring food to you and slice it onto your platter.   The staff here is absolutely amazing, charismatic, and quick. They are very quick in getting you seated and thoroughly explaining to you how their restaurant works if you're new there. The other servers are super friendly and make sure you're getting your money's worth.   For an authentic, unique Brazilian steakhouse experience, come check this place out. I guarantee you will get your money's worth, and unlike other fancy, expensive restaurants, Texas de Brazil will have you coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Excellent steaks and cuts of meat!   Skip the chicken, pork and sausages, jump right to the filet mignon wrapped in bacon and the top sirloin steak!!! Salad bar is great too-yummy prosciutto, lobster bisque soup!"}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to try this place after being disappointed numerous times at another Brazilian grill place. It's a nice addition to the ever expanding Crocker Park.   We were seated right away and was greeted by our server promptly. The server, James, went over the dining style and procedures. We placed our drink orders and started with the salad bar.   The salad bar selection is quite good. Ranging from cheeses, cured meats, leafy salads, asparagus, shrimp, artichoke, sushi, and many more. There was also sauté mushrooms, various soups, and lobster bisque for the day. The quality of the items at the salad bar is phenomenal. The asparagus was blanched perfectly. Not only was the taste and doneness on point, the trimming was perfect; no tough or inedible portions! The shrimp salad was also very good; lightly seasoned and was very fresh. The cured meats were also delicious.   Then came the meats. We sampled flank steak, top sirloin, filet mignon, beef rib, lamb chop, lamb loin, pork loin, and Brazilian sausages. All the Gauchos were very responsive to the serving card and served exactly what you ask for. Most meats were medium rare and it was cooked just that! The two meats that stood out was the flank and beef rib. The flank was seasoned very nicely with great beefy flavor and slightly crispy on the outside. The flank was also very tender, I'd have to say it was better than the filet medallions! The beef rib was insanely good; it literally melts in your mouth! These meats were served with caramelized plantains and garlic mash potatoes, which were also good.    The servers did a great job with the dessert presentation as well. Choices from dessert alcohol, nut pies, cakes, and cream brûlée. My friend ended up ordering the chocolate mousse cake to take home.   During service the servers were very attentive. Filling water as we dined. The napkins were also refolded seconds after we left our seats. Both the manager and chef stopped at our table, and others, to see how the dining experience was going. Interior is also very elegant and the bathroom design is clean and modern.   I will definitely return on a more special occasion. We were not disappointed at all and hope that the restaurant and staff keeps this level of food excellence and service for years to come!"}
{"text":"Husband and I dined here with the kids. Not bad, but not sure if I'd go back again. The food was good, just felt like I had to wait a while for my meat to be well done. They only served rare or medium rare meat. The service was phenomenal.  I enjoyed the filet and the filet with bacon. It was a great experience, but hubby and I agreed we wouldn't go back again.  Not sure if it's worth going back for the two filets I enjoyed."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with friends and it was good atmosphere with great service and the food was good salad bar was also good you must go hungry if your going to try all the meats"}
{"text":"Texas de Brazil is a place I want to go to more. I bought a VIP card at a wine tasting.  The salad bar is a buffet by itself from fresh soups, greens, shrimp, salmon, sushi and sooo much more. And if you like meat protein this is the place for you.  Our server was attentive and attentive. And I must say he was notably well groomed spotless attired and clean.  I really enjoy Texas de Brazil. And even though they are not known for thief happy hour, it is a hidden jewel."}
{"text":"Amazing, loved this place!! Everyone should go at least once.  Honestly if I go again I'll just get the salad bar because it isn't just a salad bar at all, so much amazing yummy different things. Meats and amazing lobster bisque. We hardly ate any of the meat they walk around and serve and we paid like $20 extra for that (which was fine because we wanted the whole experience). But the salad bar would fill anyone up.   Patricia was our waitress and she was amazing, so sweet and on her game. Polite and made our experience one of a kind. I would like to personally thank her.  We had a $25 off for joining the club type thing they had online, and since it was our anniversary we got a free piece of cake! So we got $34 off our bill.   I think the ONLY negative thing I could say is when you first walk in, a proper greeting would be nice. We stood there for a minute before anyone even said hi."}
{"text":"Always such a good experience when coming to this restaurant. Remember to come on an empty stomach to get your $s worth. Walked in around 2 pm and had to wait for maybe 2 minutes for our table. Server almost immediately came to get our drinks. I started off with the lobster bisque which was delicious. I try to avoid the cheesy bread but it's almost impossible. Always enjoy the caesar salad and the huge block of Parmesan cheese in the decorative bowl.  Even if you are a vegetation there is plenty to choose from: red quinoa, garlic mashed potatoes, goat cheese spread, asparagus, grape salad, artichokes, onion ceviche, roasted jalapeños, olives, tabouli, couscous, spring mix, potato salad, zucchini , cauliflower salad, cucumber salad, pineapple salad, sugar snow peas, spring mix, green beans, roasted peppers, and sliced tomatoes. Don't forget the tasty sweet fried bananas and garlic mashed potatoes! There is so much meat that is constantly being offered, some of my favorites were filet mignon, lamb chops, and leg of lamb. I also enjoyed tasting the flank steak and beef ribs. They also offer pork and chicken, didn't bother tasting any since that is something I can eat anywhere. Oh my gosh after devouring almost 3000 calories, geez possibly even more you gotta save room for dessert. They have tons of pies, cheesecakes, and flan.  The server was attentive and friendly. Looking forward to getting my birthday email- I'll be back in December!"}
{"text":"Never had a dining experience quite like this one.  I chose this place to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. He is an avid meat lover and this place went far above all of our expectations. If you are unfamiliar with this place, Texas de Brazil is a churrascaria (brazilian steakhouse) featuring a salad bar, a wide variety of all-you-can-eat meats, desserts and more. Meat carvers walk around the restaurant with specialty grilled meats on sword skewers. We tried different cuts of beef, lamb, pork, chicken and Brazilian sausage And  it's all accompanied by traditional Brazilian sides and umlimited Brazilian cheese bread. Our server was excellent! He made us laugh and went above and beyond for an amazing birthday experience. Texas de Brazil really strives on customer service. And the drinks! The sangria was superb! The salad bar is phenomenal! The next time i have a few extra bucks in my pocket, i am going to indulge here."}
{"text":"My nephew picked this spot for his birthday dinner. It is very attractive. We have been here twice before so were looking forward to dining. Thursday night reservation and only about 5-6 other tables occupied. Waiter was absent. Finally came by. Told him that 2 of us in the party would be \"salad bar only\". The guachos were fairly attentive. Our waiter however was MIA. We cleared our own plates several times. The lobster bisque on the salad bar was luke warm at best. We finally found the manager who responded promptly and we did see the waiter a bit more frequently. Lobster Bisque was returned to salad bar no warmer than it was originally. Manager offered to comp desserts. Waiter FINALLY arrived with the check and had to send him back to correct because he charged the dinner price for the two who only had salad bar.  Just not the dining experience we had on previous visits. Not sure we will be returning."}
{"text":"Whoa! I've never had to just quit! Meat Meat and more good Meat ! Fantastic service fantastic meats fire cooked and seasoned to perfection!! Do it if ya haven't yet!! Do it till ya gotta tap out, you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I thought I would have a great experience eating a real Brazilian barbecue and it did not happen. Besides the restaurant does not have many side dishes that we are accustomed to eating in Brazil, the manager there has been extremely unfriendly and grumpy. It sure is a restaurant in which I do not feel like coming back."}
{"text":"My husband and I took a little impromptu trip to Las Vegas for work related reasons and I am sooooo glad we decided to eat here! I am an avid lover of all things meat. I've been to other Brazilian churrascarias and this one ranks as the best one. The wait staff was amazing, prices were reasonable, and most of all the food was delicious. Every meat I tried was great with my favorite being the garlic sirloin. My husbands favorite was the bacon wrapped chicken. The dessert menu looked so great that we each got our own instead of sharing like we usually do. I had a super moist and decadent chocolate cake and he had the bananas foster pie. We both topped off desert with Godiva White chocolate liqueur infused coffee."}
{"text":"Great meal with a huge variety of grilled meat coming to the table after we got our salads at the salad bar. Bacon wrapped filet was one of my favorites. Also grilled pork chops were excellent!!"}
{"text":"Delicious. A bit pricey but they do offer a military discount for which I was grateful that could be applied to my whole table. The area is also really nice to take a stroll after such a big meal."}
{"text":"Really good but way too much food.  I felt full even the next day which is not normal for me at all, I am always hungry.  You may think you have to like beef to go here well I don't and liked it anyway.  There is a big salad bar with all kinds of good things and there are plenty of other kinds of meat that they bring around to your table including chicken, pork, and lamb.  I really liked the Parmesan pork!"}
{"text":"Wow! Wow! Wow!  Went for lunch at 1:00pm today, only two other tables occupied when we got there.  Our server was Justine who did a great job, the first thing that he asked us was how we liked our meat cooked.  Of course my wife and daughter insist on well done.  Everything did come well done except one steak - I had a medium piece and they took the rest back for more cooking.  At one point we had Justine and three meat cutters at our table at once.  Everything at the salad bar was excellent.  The mushrooms in wine sauce make a good side for your steak. My wife keeps on repeating how great it was."}
{"text":"Had dinner with a large party. First time here, but have been to Brasa Grill before. Same style of service and food.  Overall quality of food was very good. Meats were all very tasty and cooked to perfection.  The \"salad\" bar is much more than that. Salad, soup, rice, cheeses, meats, olives and more. This could be a meal in itself.   Service was a little lacking however.  Waiter forgot our side dishes and when reminded brought what I thought was a small amount for our group. We asked for more, but that didn't come until we were pretty much done eating. Asked for a refill on coffee that never came as well.  That being said, experience overall was good and we'll definitely return. Almst forgot; cocktails were really good!"}
{"text":"What a treat this was!   It's my favorite, an ayce buffet. Everything was epic and can't wait to go back.   Located on the edge of town square, which is on Las Vegas Blvd not a far drive from the strip.   Make a reservation. You don't need to dress up major but it is a nice place and very busy. Worth the wait, the hype is real.   I got a little bit of everything naturally and was very pleased with it all. Salad bar is very good quality with lots of options I enjoyed. Salmon, grapes, olives, cheeses, cucumbers, and so much more. The house vinaigrette was so good to top it all. Lobster bisque was nice, pineapple slices were so good, loved everything.  After dishing my salad we at and found they had already brought us bread, potatoes, and bananas. Soon after several meat carvers came around. You may have to wait to get seated but when you do the food comes fast and from every angle. So much fun.   Simply flip this card over they give you and they will stop bringing meat, flip it back over when ready for more fresh meats.  This kept the meat carving service at the pace you want.   Speaking of service it was absolutely amazing teamwork the whole time. The waiter and staff really impressed me with their attention to detail. Removing plates very quick. Refills often. Once noticing that I was little worried a piece of meat was too raw,  he instantly said if any meat is too raw for your liking just don't eat it and we'll bring another cooked just right.   Impressed with the service and staff for sure and just loved the food. I'll be back very often. Thanks again to yelp friends for helping me find this place. My phone battery died but I knew this meal was going to be so epic I bought a new S9 just to get the best pictures possible. Haha. Thanks for reading and hope you enjoy your meal if you visit. Take care."}
{"text":"This last time when I brought my significant other for a very special date, I was very disappointed. Up until my last experience, I loved this place and brought people every time they are in town! I have easily been here over 25 times. Many of my colleagues also frequent here.  The coffee was cold when it came to the table, not warm actually cold and our reservations were at 1230 which is only 30 minutes after they open. When my new coffee did come out no new creamer or sugar was brought to the table with it, which I do not recall ever having to ask to be done so I waited with my black coffee until the waiter made his way to us again. My hunny was never asked if he would like a refill on his drink the entire meal. It was just one thing after another on this visit and is so surprising for a place that is usually flawless. Next I informed our server I have a cinnamon allergy and asked for the fried bananas without cinnamon as I always do and this time they arrived soggy lacking the usual chefs integrity. Even when I told our server about my severe allergy he seemed scared to request them and emphasized that it would take quite some time because they just made a large batch of the ones with cinnamon. I informed him I was aware they would take some time which is why I ordered them early while we ordered the drinks. It was also the first time I had a cut of meat completely over done, I mean it was rubbery and charred which is also not the norm for this place. The ribs usually melt right off the bone and were tough this time too. Usually every different meat that comes around to your table here is perfection, but not so on this visit.   Lastly, the manager actually noticed I had a comment card in my hand and made a point to walk my pace to time perfectly meeting me at the exit and receive my card. I was impressed! Until he failed to address the comment card. We actually were standing outside the establishment for about 15 minutes talking about our experience and planning our next place to go. And not so much as a  personal apology, phone call or email! Which lead me to believe he just chucked my comment card. The card even says printed right on it... don't wait to write us a bad review let us fix it now... Epic Fail!"}
{"text":"Great service, decor and food. I was very pleased with my overall experience at this new Pittsburgh Churrascaria. I've been to quite a few Brazilian steakhouses and the quality of meat here is one of the highest I've had. The flank steak was my favorite, with a gamier, more grassy flavor to the meat. Very different and awesome. The quality of the filet mignon was excellent, too, and I consider myself a filet connosieur. :) Try the traditional Brazilian drink Caipirinha. It is a sweeter, smoother version of a margarita but made with rum. They have a few flavors, strawberry being my favorite. Our server Eddie was incredibly personable, funny, and efficient. He took care of all of my food allergies and let me know what was safe!   Gluten free info: most of the meats are gluten free, but a lot of the salad bar/hot food bar items aren't. In fact, I was told every hot food bar item had gluten in it, as well as the bread, salami, shrimp and salmon on the salad bar. No Fogo de Chao similarities there.  Soy allergy: do not eat any meat that has been marinated, no salad dressings, no marinated items on the salad bar. All have soybean oil. However, the chef specially made cuts of meat for me without marinade so I could sample everything! Very hospitable.   There was a little miscommunication about what was safe for me to eat, but considering this is a new restaurant and I have a billion food allergies, they worked very hard to make sure I didn't get sick!"}
{"text":"This place is evil man. Leave your card green and friendly guys with Carne on a stick roll by and feed you. Leave your card red and you feel like you are neglecting them. My card was green all the time and long story short, I demolished everything I saw in sight! Awesome place if you want to roll food coma status!!!!"}
{"text":"Never leave this place hungry- that's forsure. Even vegatarians can not resist. The smell, look, and taste of all the meats is too perfect. Don't get me wrong, the salad bar is above par, but who wants to say no to the meats?? No one."}
{"text":"We go to these steakhouses all over and have a different experience each time. This one was pretty solid! I have never before had California roll sushi on the salad bar but it was delish! I went on a Saturday night so the house was packed and I can't say we had the \"best\" service as far as getting the attention of the meat servers although our cards were on green. Nonetheless, our waitress asked if there were any meats we would still like and requested those servers come back out to our table. All around, good dining experience!"}
{"text":"Always the very best food! Love the atmosphere and the staff and management always are on their game!"}
{"text":"Super awesome of this place to respect my request to have a lower priced meal.  Had gastric bypass and can only eat about three pieces of meat yet they want me to pay full price.  I get it's their real but you'd think $25 would be better than nothing and loss of a customer.  Oh well won't ever go here again!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I have to say that Texas de Brazil have an awesome salad bar. They also have a good rodizio, yet it has a spicy cost. One of the things I like about Texas de Brazil is their picanha, but I don't like how you have to get the all you can eat \"rodizio\" to eat it. So, there are other places in town where you can get a certain type of meat, or plate a la cart! However, this is not the case of Texas de Brazil so it loses one start for it.  Another concern I have is in regards to their caipirinha! I'm sorry Texas de Brazil, but you have to step up and start using real sugar to make caipirinhas. As a Brazilian who goes constantly to steakhouses in Las Vegas (every week), I have to say that their caipirinha really sucks! It hurts me having to say that, but it's true. So it loses another star for claiming that they are making Caipirinhas correctly, while using fake sugar syrup to craft them. I even asked the server to use real sugar, but my request was denied and the drinks tasted weird and fake. Not to say that they still charged me for that so I have to take one star for it.  Alright, so besides the lack of options for dining and the bad caipirinhas Texas de Brazil has a beautiful dining room and lots of space for you to bring your whole family! Just remember to not bring your 100 years old grandma to eat there unless you want her to have a heart attack. As there's not an option for ala cart, you must be aware that every time you go there, you will end up spending at least 70 dollars per person with taxes and tip.  Texas de Brazil is used to having lots of tourists, so I feel like they left the locals behind and this is the reason why I have to rate it accordingly to my experience. I'm a local, and I will be updating my review as they improve. If they start to make Caipirinhas with real sugar and add some new options other than rodízio on your menu, then I'm willing to increase their rating.  Finally, my review is based on their competition, which have constantly been taking customers input and improving their menu, deals and drinks. So, nothing more fare than expecting the same from Texas de Brazil right? If they really care about their locals like me, then eventually they will reach out to me and listen to what me and others have to say regarding their menu and Caipirinhas. This is an important topic as Caipirinhas are our national Drinks and it should be made correctly. Cheating out on sugar won't help you improve our experience and their ratings.  Hence, I hope you find this review helpful as I have addressed the pros and cons of this large Brazilian steakhouse. If you are looking for an alternative restaurant where you can get ala cart items at a very discounted price, then you can try Via Brazil steakhouse that offers ala cart options, happy hour deals at a fraction of the regular price and real Caipirinhas (crafted with real sugar and lots of limes). Let me know what you think about those differences I've addressed."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Brazilian Steakhouse and I think it was just average. I only eat fish so I do not recommend this restaurant for anyone who does not eat beef or pork.  There is a salad bar but for the price you pay for it is not worth it.  There was sushi,  salmon, and veggies. I hated that all the vegetables were served cold. There really weren't alot of hot optons to choose from.   However, the service was great. It is a very fast pace restaurant and the servers are on point. I would not be going again but I think its a nice experience."}
{"text":"I made reservations on Open Table for 6:30PM.   We checked in at 6:20PM and were told by the female Maitre D' we would be seated momentarily.  This was one of many lies that young lady would tell.  After standing around for 25 minutes I went to check on what was going on.  She seemed annoyed that i was bothering her.  She quickly said there were several others ahead of me and that my party would be coming up soon.  We were finally called at 7:20 and could have walked in without a reservation and got in at the same time.  the people behind me who got in at the same time as me did just that.    So I was willing to accept that the food would be worth the wait.  I had heard nothing but good things about this place and the reviews were positive.  I will say the salad bar was nice and they had allot of things to choose from.  The meat was OK and not as good as i had expected.  From overcooked to just bland was the theme.  The lamb was the only thing that stood out as being special.       The service was slow and we waited for everything from the Waiter.  The Servers carrying the meat were nice but they became scarce after the first go around and we had to call them over several times to get the items we liked.  For what you pay to eat here you truly do not get your moneys worth.  I was not impressed and will not return.  They don't care about customer service or quality just get them in and get them out!  This by far was the worst meal of 2016!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! And our waiter Claudio was great! He really did a great job and we will be requesting him again!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING! I've been to many Brazilian steak houses in NY and this one was probably the best I've been to. The food is delicious. The service is great. I was debating between this one and fogo de chao but fogo couldn't even compete. From the mash potatoes to the plantains to the meats, everything is perfectly seasoned. I would say save your money from the las vegas buffets and take an uber to Texas De Brazil. You'll love it!"}
{"text":"One of the best in Vegas,service excellent, been to many Brazilian restaurants in NY and Vegas by far the best off all."}
{"text":"Delicious all the way, along with expensive as well. For the 2 of us we paid $124 with a tip included. Salad bar and a small hot plate station. Wait staff always late in picking up plates or to pour your drink."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been dining at Texas D Brazil for years at the Las Vegas location. Recently we have had a server that makes our visit all the more extraordinary. His name is Vance. He has the most delightful and welcoming energy. He was very attentive, ensuring our meats came out as requested and in a timely manner. All of our needs were met with a smile. Although it was no special occasion, we felt as though we were treated like royalty . By far the most AWESOME customer service experience!!!!!   Food was FANTASTIC as usual"}
{"text":"Always a great experience! Good food, great salad bar, terrific lobster bisque, outstanding service! We've been there 4 times and every time it's been very good."}
{"text":"Took my husband here for his birthday because he is a carnivore and I heard this is the place to go for that! We loved it. We went during lunch time about 1:30 pm on a Saturday with a party of 9 and seating was great, kid friendly (I have 1 1/2 year old) and great service. My husband was a huge fan of the lamb and I was in love with the black beans!!! YUM I really enjoyed this place and tho the price could be intimidating it's great for special occasions."}
{"text":"Delicious and great atmosphere for date nights or family dinners. Salad bar is enough to satisfy, but the food is too irresistible to turn down"}
{"text":"Amazing dinner with friends from out of town . We loved it the beef rib was amazing the bacon wrapped chicken amazing . I love love love this place . You should go with a huge appetite you will for sure need it . The bisque soup was yummy . I had a large salad and my whole group was thrilled"}
{"text":"I am not really sure how this place is so popular. I'm not a meat eater so for me it wasn't really worth going I went for a birthday party. The only thing I really ate was a salad and that was pretty much a stretch and I paid I believe $25 for the salad bar only but a lot of things were not vegetarian and dairy free. But if you are a meat eater how could anyone eat that much meat it just seems absurd I sort of feel like you could never eat your money's worth in meat is it possible LOL"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat, I don't rate many places 5 stars unless I really think they deserve it and this place does. It's a great experience to bring your family or friends since it's different than most dining experiences. I have not been to another Brazilian steakhouse to compare this to but I'm afraid if I do I'll be disappointed from comparing it to this place. My favorite is the braised beef ribs. Also get the lobster bisque and have them put fresh black pepper on it and dip the cheese bread. Their top sirloin is my second favorite. I also enjoyed their Parmesan chicken it's very juicy. I'm not a big fan of lamb chops but they cook it just right to cook off the gamey flavor.  Their service matches the quality of their food. They are very attentive to you and take care of you. Fake or not they definitely fake it till they make it, these servers deserve respect and a nice tip."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat!!  Our first time there with our 3 boys and it was fantastic.  When we arrived, the place was jammed packed and we thought it was going to be about a 30 min wait.  Heck no!  They got us seated in less than 5!  They explained to us how it works there for the food and we were off!  Let me tell you, their quinoa salad and tabulah-I'm probably spelling that wrong- was SO GOOD!!  I also had their lobster bisque, a few crackers with the AMAZING goat cheese, and oh my!! Their cheese filled bread!!  To die for!  They also served us their garlic mashed potatoes and sweet fried bananas.  Yummo!!!  As far as their meats, I had their flank steak and the bacon wrapped filet mignon.  My son and husband had a lot more of their meat than I did and they enjoyed it all!  We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Ask for Rachel to be your server.  She give that extra special attention and makes the meal a lot better.  I went another time and another server didn't recommend anything and didn't tell us that we have to request certain cuts from the kitchen I was never going to go back I hated the experience.  Try the beef short ribs, 2 cuts of house steak and skip all the chicken.  Lamb was good and not too \"gamey\"."}
{"text":"I love this place!!  Any place that has prosciutto and grana padano cheese at their salad bar gets my heart.  Who doesn't love some cured meats and cheeses to start off a meal?  The lobster bisque is to die for.  there are so many items at the salad bar that I can't even begin to name them all, just know that the salad bar is excellent.    Now on to the meats!!  Filet mignon is tender and juicy, everything you imagine it to be.  Braised beef ribs are one of my favorite items here.  They are wonderfully flavorful, basting in its own juices.  Lamb chops are wonderful, tender, and juicy.  Barzilian sausage has a little bit of kick and great flavor.  Flank steak was another winner.  And the house special sirloin is definitely the star of the show.  That layer of fat bordering the succulent meat provides the perfect amount of flavor to the sirloin.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  The meat coma is totally worth it!!!"}
{"text":"I went along with a few friends on a Friday during restaurant week. We had a reservation for 9pm and arrived just minutes before 9. However we were instructed to wait for our table at the bar and it would be 930 when they finally paged us. It was a disappointing start since when you make a reservation and the restaurant takes it, you expect to be seated at that time.   Fortunately, things were about to get better. The salad bar was decent, not as big as the one at fogo de chao but not shabby at all. The real star however, was the different cuts of meat for sure. Generally speaking, everything I tried was juicy and seasoned well. Our waiter was attentive and constantly checking on us. Meat didn't come at a pace I have experienced at fogo de chao but we hardly had to wait for too long either.   In the end, the dining experience was well worth the price. Not to mention that the price was reduced for restaurant week. Will probably visit again."}
{"text":"Great! Service was great! Food was great! But 4 stars because the carpet in the front was pretty dirty which made me double think about the place since the front carpet was the first thing I saw. But it was worth it. Just remove or wash the front carpet and it would be great!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing meat and I love the concept. To be honest, via de Brazil's meat has more flavor. Either way I love this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great service and even better food! Every time I come here I end up scarfing down tons of the side dishes and really only have a small amount of the delicious carved meats this place serves up! They had a new coffee crusted pork loin that was perfectly charred and melted in my mouth. The spicy shrimp that was on the bar was also one of my favorite side diahes. I was lucky enough to come on lobster bisque night! Had 3 bowls of it like a boss! Also it was my wife's Bday and they brought her a complimentary cheese cake with a candle and happy birthday in chocolate written on the plate. Think I'm gonna make it mandatory to celebrate every secular holiday here instead of cooking!!"}
{"text":"The food and buffet was great. Wise there were a few more chicken options with less pork, but the beef options were amazing and tasty!"}
{"text":"Texas De Brazil is so close to being an excellent Brazilian steakhouse but falls short in a few key areas...  Salad bar - the selection at the salad bar is good, but several of the items (specifically cheeses) were missing identifiers. The smoked salmon was inconsistent, with the first time we had it being great, second time really bad (very fishy), and third time it was warm. Their black bean dish (feijoada) the first time did not appear to have meat but the second and third was stocked with pork.   Gaucho service - my biggest gripe i find in many Brazilian Steakhouses are the lack of consistency in meats and temperature. Texas DB makes it a point to ask what temperature you'd prefer, then everyone stops by with shoe leather well done. I was disappointed all three times we've been there because we received only a fraction of their actual meat selection and even after asking for specific meats they did not come around, but went to tables closer to the kitchen.   Servers & host staff - good, consistent drink refills and knowledge about the bar menu. Frequently offered to refill our side dishes.   Overall, they have a lot of potential but fall short in creating a positive experience."}
{"text":"Overpriced dining experience. Lots of variety of meat and huge salad bar with many options. But unless you bring a large appetite it's very overpriced. Servers were great. Most of the food was good some of the meat flavors were bland."}
{"text":"This is our go-to restaurant for special events.  The beef selections are unbelievable!  My favorite was the flank steak - the seasonings were perfect.  The salad bar is so impressive with hundreds of selections.  Good desserts too!"}
{"text":"If I want the meat sweats...I come here!  Great food and as good as the salad bar is, man up and skip it! You're here for all you can eat quality meat!!!"}
{"text":"A great place for the carnivore!  They never miss on service or food quality! Great place to take friends!"}
{"text":"We had an absolutely wonderful dinner here on 1/10/17. Thiago was a terrific server, explaining how the experience works and a background on Brazilian culture and food. He was attentive but wasn't overbearing. 5/5 stars for service and food. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"We finally tried it (after having been to Green Forest years ago), knowing it would be a TON of food. We both like the decor and location much better than Green Forest. Texas de Brazil seemed to have a more varied meat selection, but sadly they do not do the cinnamon grilled pineapple (my favorite dish that went around Green Forest). The service was amazing and the food was delicious! A couple things we got later were a bit overcooked, but the first round was all perfectly prepared, too.  TONS of food, so we definitely can't go to restaurants like this often, but the food was worth the unhappy stomach.  The bar was nice, too. Great happy hour specials were surprising and the service there was great, too. Amanda was wonderful. Sadly, I don't remember our waitress' name. I only remember Amanda's, since a friend of ours who's a bartender is also named Amanda. Ha ha ha..."}
{"text":"Great Variety of Sides..... and Lots and Lots of Delicious Meats... I left there feeling So Satisfied..... Staff was very helpful and attentive..."}
{"text":"Pretty good Brazilian themed chain restaurant located in Station Square. Definitely an upscale vibe as far as the decor. Our server was super polite and very nice.  If you've never been to a Brazilian churrascaria place, it's basically a meat buffet. You get a card that you can turn to red or green. Red means stop and green means keep it coming. Steak, chicken parmasean, bacon wrapped steak, skirt steak, filet, lamb and a few more. Servers walk around with skewers and they cut off pieces of you want to try it.  There's also a salad bar with some hot sides and soup. The lobster bisque was good. I try not to fill up on the sides so I can have room for the meat. There weren't much side hot side options. The Jasmine rice was good. Some of the meat was a little salty but otherwise ok.  The price was a little high for the small side and salad bar."}
{"text":"This is my first time at a Texas de Brazil, and it was an excellent experience. I was surprised that I could sit at the bar and be served meat, so I took that opportunity. The bartender and servers were polite and attentive. The salad bar was fresh, the bread was hot, and I got au gratin potatoes... a dish that I've missed for the past year or so at Fogo de Chao, another Brazilian steakhouse. I recommend this place based on my first experience."}
{"text":"Went there to celebrate my wife's birthday the food is fresh and tastes great service was great I like the way they have it set up. The buffet salad bar then you sit at the table and they bring you different cuts of meat . Make sure to get the chimey churry from the salad bar it's a good accent to the meat"}
{"text":"Had a pleasant dinner for two at the new Texas de Brazil in Crocker Park:  The food was fairly good, though the cuts of meat tended to be dry and overcooked.  I was very impressed, however, with the friendly, attentive service and the style of the dining room.  Certainly the unique nature of the restaurant, where one can taste a variety of meats--not to mention in unlimited quantities--makes for quite an experience.  However, the logistics of the churrascaria--using smaller cuts of meat and necessarily having to take the time to parade them around the dining room--tends to lead to more dried-out morsels than what is expected out of the \"medium to medium-rare\" they are quoted at.  Again, the focus is on variety over precision:  If you are going to be persnickety that your filet mignon should be at \"medium rare plus,\" I would direct you to the Hyde Park or Cabin Club steakhouses nearby.  That all said, the particular meat highlights for me were the beef ribs (where the fat keeps the meat moist) and the Brazilian sausage.  On the other hand, the Parmesan chicken drumettes were a big miss--far too dry, small, and bony to be enjoyable.  The salad/sides bar seemed more focused on antipasto and sides to go with your dinner than providing the basics for constructing a dinner salad.  Some highlights were the fresh mozzarella, proscuitto, salami, thin slices of pineapple, and a bowl full of strips of peppered bacon.  The salad itself was pretty average with a limited choice of dressings available (blue cheese, ranch, Brazilian vinaigrette, and one other I cannot recall).  The other sides left much to be desired--and possibly because of our arrival late in the day (though that is not an excuse):  The lobster bisque was bland and the potatoes au gratin were a little dried out and clearly had been sitting around for too long.  Overall, I would see the salad/sides bar as the part of the restaurant presently most in need of improvement.  For dessert, we split a very good chocolate cake, which was one of about eight pretty basic options including creme brulee, carrot cake, key lime pie, and banana cream pie.  The slice of cake came out a little chilled but more than made up for it in chocolaty decadence.  At the server's recommendation, we paired the cake with a flight of Godiva liqueurs--dark chocolate, milk chocolate, and white chocolate.  So with the overall food highlights mostly focused on the experience as a whole over individual taste, where Texas de Brazil really came through for me was the service, which was surprising for a chain restaurant and a newly-opened one at that.  Our server, who had evidently come up from the Columbus location to help out with the opening, seemed genuinely invested in making sure we had a great experience, whether it be decanting our bottle of wine, constantly checking if there were any particular meats we were looking for (and finally coming through with the aforementioned beef ribs after a bit of a wait), or folding our napkins while we were away at the salad bar.  And when we had a question that he could not fully answer, I was surprised to see the manager visit our table later in the meal to follow-up.  I cannot think of a comparable experience for another place in this restaurant's class.  Complimenting the service was a fantastic looking dining room, easily the best looking dining room in Crocker Park.  Usual steakhouse tones of brown, beige, and wood-paneling are replaced with dramatically-lit whites, reds, blacks, chrome, mirrors, high ceilings, and a glass wine cellar.  (The wine list seemed to hold its own and featured a number of selections from South America.)  The well-spaced layout of the dining room facilitates visits to the salad bar as well as the gauchos' never-ending task of delivering meat to hungry customers.  While I did not visit the bar, it did look classy and inviting.  I haven't been to a churrascaria in a very long time, and even that location (Brasa Grill in downtown Cleveland) has fallen on my banned list after leaving my family with a bout of food poisoning on a subsequent visit.  I am pleased to report no similar issues for Texas de Brazil, which, as far as I can recall, delivered a superior experience to its downtown competitor.  Of course, all this came at a relatively high price point--about $110 for the above meal for two not including wine and tip.  Texas de Brazil is not a value play for anyone except the most ardent all-you-can-eaters, but remains a solid special occasional restaurant that is good for groups and, in the end, a welcome addition to Crocker Park."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I thought it was great! They have two different prices for lunch and dinner which I think was $32 vs $52. This does include the price of the salad bar and dessert.  It's a very busy and loud inside. There are servers walking around with all different kinds of meat serving it to you if you would like it. They had sirloin, filet mignonette, Parmesan chicken, lamb chops, strip steak, sausage, ribs, pork and some other meat I can't remember. The salad bar is buffet style so you can go whenever you want. They had lobster bisque, salad, all the toppings, different cheeses, bread, au gratin potatoes, etc..  At your table they leave mashed potatoes, plantains, and little cheesy breads that are all you can eat. After you've finished they bring a dessert tray and you pick the dessert of your choice. Choices were flan, Brazilian dessert, coconut pie, cheesecake, chocolate mousse cake, carrot cake, maybe a pecan pie, a caramel type pie, and a few others I also can't remember."}
{"text":"Do not waste your time going here!! This is as Brazilian as Olive Garden is Italian!! NOT! The waiters ( I won't dare say Gauchos) were walking around with skewers of meat not knowing where to go!!! Many of them Passing our table when we clearing had our disc side up that we wanted food... When the meat finally started coming out there wasn't much to choose from. Oh and the $25.00 coupon offered if you sign up for alerts doesn't come until after you've been there. Asked the waitress if she could take off the $25,00 and she said they needed the code from the email.  When I got the email there was no code. .  Texas de BraZil does Not compare to Fogo by any means.  If you want a good steak in Pittsburgh go to Hyde Park!!    If you are ever in Philly and want impeccable food and service visit Fogo de chao!!! You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"the location has this place busy . but honest although I've been a few times, I'm not hot to go back.. the meats are WAAY to salty for my taste . Lamb chops are good everything else I couldn't choke down.. salad bar is lovely I did wish they had more veggies tho.. for me not worth the price"}
{"text":"This probably the Best Steak house ever! Great service!! Good food!! Awesome atmosphere!! Definently recommendation for anyone visiting Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Now thats what I am talking about.... I wish i could do this everyday... I would be 400 lbs within the month..."}
{"text":"My friend bought my husband and I there for our first time. It was really good. The staff was very helpful and polite. Food was wonderful as well. Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"Recently had lunch for my bday here with my family. The meat that had us going was the lamb chops!! Beautiful place when u want some quality meat. The best! My little sister had her wedding reception here few years back. Service was perfect!!! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"First time here and I will definitely come back again. Food is amazing, especially the lamb chop. Our server, Amanda, is excellent. She explained everything clearly and her service was amazing. The men who bring out the food are also nice! Overall, I am very pleased with this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Service could've been better. Our waitress didn't pour any wine after she opened the bottle. Maybe my standards are too high, but if I'm spending 550 at your restaurant I expect that equivalent level of service at my table."}
{"text":"Some meats were overcooked, but the servers tried their best to to get it to medium rare perfection.   TIP: Super busy so make sure to get a reservation. We waited ~25 mins even with a reservation and the hostess let in people who came in after us.  Oh, and the chocolate cake is TO DIE FOR! Excellent chocolate mousse cake."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! Made reservations on Open Table super easy to do. Unfortunately I was running late no time to change, i rolled in with a tank top, jacket, shorts and slippers;( but they still let me in.  This place is pretty hip so I'll need to dress up better next time.   Why 5 stars??? -Food- High quality AYCE steakhouse. The salad bar is delicious and has a good variety of hot and cold items don't eat too much! They will bring you cheese Bread, mashed potatoes and Fried plantains to the table. Then let the fun begin, flip the tablecard over to green and then watch as a bunch of guys come by your table with top Sirloin, sausages, filet mignon, roasted lamb, garlic steak, parmesan crusted chicken, bacon wrapped chicken, flank steak and a few more.  Some were on the salty side but wow it was delicious! I loved that you can choose whatever you want to try and such great table service.  We ordered flan for dessert which was yummy!    -Service and \"HERO\" support- service was outstanding, very professional and always made sure that we were taken care of despite my disheveled attire.   *****They give 20% of your meal up to 8 people on your table for \"Heroes\" this Includes Military, Veterans, EMS, Firefighters, Law enforcement and TEACHERS!!!!*******  Although I'm not a teacher I really respect an establishment that recognizes them as well as the other public servants like EMS and Fireman.  Just mention this before you get your bill this saved us 20$ on our bill!   I'll definitely be back next time I'm in vegas.  Classy establishment, delicious food and great concept and customer service."}
{"text":"What a great experience!  My husband wanted to treat me to a nice dinner since we have been like two ships passing in the night lately,  so he made reservations here.  We had never been before,  so we didn't know exactly what to expect,  but we were pleased.    Our server,  Connor,  was wonderful!  He was very thorough in his explanation of how the dining experience was going to go as far as foods and what meats would be offered.  We opted for a bottle of wine to share, even though it was a bit pricey.... and I ended up drinking most of it myself.   The meats were cooked to medium rare,  which my husband likes,  but I like mine more medium well.  The men going around the dining area were polite when I asked for my meats to be cooked longer and were prompt in returning with them.    My hubby ordered the Brazilian cheesecake for dessert while I visited the restroom.  Very nice restroom by the way!  Dessert was wonderful!  Fudge, cheesecake, caramel & pecans.... YUM!   The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars..... The price.  Our bill ended up being $150 before tip. Had we not gotten the bottle of wine,  it would have been much less,  but hey \"when in Rome\" as they say. We knew it would be expensive, and it was good, but I think it's a bit over priced.  Other than that,  great experience & we will probably be back on a special occasion like our 1 year wedding anniversary in November!"}
{"text":"Long overdue review! This is my favorite restaurant for years. I love all the different selections of delicious meats. My favorite is the bacon wrapped filet mignon and bacon wrapped chicken. The little bread balls are yummy and the mashed potatoes and fried bananas are great. But really though, I come here for the au gratin potatoes. So damn good! Service is always excellent."}
{"text":"One of my favorites, always so good! I hate the wait though and it's nearly impossible to go without a reservation"}
{"text":"I couldn't say more positive things about Texas de Brazil. Gabriella our server was amazing. She was sooo funny! The salad bar was perfection. The roasted garlic, olives, pineapple carpaccio, smoked salmon and arrangement of cold cuts and cheeses were a table favorite.  Now for the meats... WOW. The bacon wrapped chicken, sirloin, filet, bacon wrapped filet, Parmesan chicken, and the beef tri tip were sooo good! But let's talk Brazilian sausage. THAT was the highlight. I think I had at least 4 haha.  For desert since I can't do gluten or dairy I opted for extra plantains. Covered in sugar and cinnamon they were absolute perfection! I think Andy literally ate 6 plates  sooo good!  Cannot wait to come back. Thanks for the amazing meal!"}
{"text":"Make sure you are hungry and you like to eat meat. The style of a Brazilian BBQ is to have servers roving around the dining floor with a variety of meats. They stop by your table and offer you some of the meat they are offering. These meats include filet mignon, filet mignon wrapped in bacon, sausage, Parmesan pork, bacon wrapped chicken, flank steak, ribs, etc. You will be given a button to put on your table that indicates whether you want the servers to stop by or not.   The meats are high quality and they also offer some side dishes in addition to full access to a large salad bar. The side dishes include mashed potatoes, cinnamon fried bananas, and Brazilian cheese bread. The salad bar has soups, salads, cheeses, vegetables, deli meats, and some other food items.   It's basically a gourmet buffet with a twist. The service is attentive and if there is any meat you are looking for in particular, you can just ask.   My only complaint would be the price, but for what you are getting and the experience, the price is actually very reasonable. It's a great place to celebrate a special occasion or dine out to.   The inside area, while large, doesn't feel like you are in a large buffet dining hall. The lighting is dim and feels intimate even though there are lots of nearby tables.   Make sure you get a reservation if you are dining with a large group, or be prepared to wait 30-45 minutes in peak times."}
{"text":"Was here on Saturday with my girlfriend. These style of restaurants are a little pricey, but worth it. They come by every few minutes with a cut of meat for you to eat, and each cut is cooked to perfection. The salad bar was also amazing, especially the sushi and lobster bisque. The dessert than totally drove it home.   The server, Luis, was very friendly and earned a 20% tip. I also like how attentive the management was. Gentlemen in suits and ties came by every few minutes to make sure we enjoyed our time.  I highly recommend this place and it's now another reason I like coming back home to Pittsburgh.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent place for a celebration we visited this place for Father's Day. And not only did they treat you with great service but our server was more then he needed to be. My little one was being a bit fussy and he attempted to keep her busy. He didn't have to but he went out of his way to make us feel comfortable. That was extremely appreciated. Just make sure you come in here with appetite and the unlimited salad bar was AMAZING. totally would recommend."}
{"text":"Great customer service and a great experience every time I dine in. Everyone from the hostesses, bartenders, servers, carvers, to the management, all are pleasant, professional, and knowledgeable. Texas De Brazil is always on top of their game! Great place to bring to Cleveland. This place is a must for meat lovers! Meat cooked to your liking and it never stops until you say so. Come hungry and leave more than happy!"}
{"text":"It was a pretty cool experience definitely packed and i can see why. The waiter was super nice and helpful answered all our questions. The salad bar is good and different not your typical salad bar but it was really delicious. Tons of variety. The guys walking around with meat was pretty cool you have different selections of meats really good everything can't go wrong. Make sure to make reservations because there is a wait for sure."}
{"text":"We went here for Valentine's Day and it was great. Friendly staff, amazing service, and delicious food. We had reservations and were seated right away. Salad bar had a large variety of food - lobster bisque was delicious but limit yourself or you'll get full on the steak, lamb, and chicken fast! The meal also comes with bread, mashed potatoes, and banana (dessert?). I would definitely come back"}
{"text":"This is for those who love meat, they come with various cuts of meat from beef,pork, lamb, chicken and more. They have a nice salad and side bar, but be careful it will fill you up quickly before the cuts of meat come out. They give u a card green on one side red on other green so waiters know you want to continue to get served cuts of meat. Red for when u either eating or just don't need any more. The service is very friendly and fast. It is rather pricey $50 per person we had table of 5 people and the bill total was about $387 with drinks and tip, but the xperience is priceless. YOU MUST TRY AT LEAST ONCE."}
{"text":"Meat galore!  Much of the meat is served medium to medium-rare...you can get some less rare, but it seems to be a little limited. Salad bar is fantastic!  If you get on their email list they will send you a sweet coupon."}
{"text":"Very beautiful inside and clean. Food was seasoned nicely and came fresh and fast. Make sure you flip the card over when your done collecting the meat you want because it will just keep on coming . The sides bar was nicely stocked and had quite a few things to choose. Custom your own charcuterie plate, soups, salads, veggies ect.. You also will get complementary sides brought to your table. The plantains/bananas melt in your mouth, Try them! I also recommend trying the lamb, it was my 1st time ever having it and i have to say it was thee best meat that i had to choose from. Meat lovers dream place!"}
{"text":"I mean I really don't think there is a bad review about this place and if so your probably just one of those people who complain about the best things in life. This is honestly not only an amazing restaurant but also an amazing experience, something you must do at least once.   Dinner runs about $50 a person but trust me you will eat much more the $50 worth.   You start by being seated ( we had a 8pm reservation, showed up a bit early and was seated promptly at 8) they take your drink order water is free, everything else is extra. They have a extensive amazing drink menu with everything from cocktails to 5 pages of wine. Your then sent to get your plate and start off at the \"Salad Bar\" which feels wrong giving it such a basic name because not only does it have salad options you have amazing veggies options, cheese, salami, shrimp, salmon, over 50+ options. AND THE SOUP THE CRAB BISQUE do not forget to try it. I would go there just for the crab bisque.  You then head back to your table where you are in the greatest way bombarded by meat options from carver after carver. Every kind of meat you can imagine cooked and seasoned to perfection! Bring your fat pants because you will need them!  They then offer you a dessert menu which is all the desserts on all a platter (fake but they look real lol) and you take your choosing.   The staff is amazing from the greeters, servers, and carvers! I can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"I came here to celebrate my 27th birthday. When I called to make the reservation, I was asked if I were celebrating anything special, and I said yes, my birthday. When we arrived at the restaurant, our hostess again asked whether we were celebrating any special occasion, and again, I replied \"birthday.\" Somehow, none of these notes were communicated to our server though, and my birthday was never acknowledged, even though a neighboring table got a slice of birthday cake with a candle. I even used a birthday $25 off two dinners coupon during this meal, so I don't know how much more obvious I could have been.  My little grudge aside, the interior of this Texas de Brazil, like all Texas de Brazil locations, is quite opulent. Service is attentive and they will come by to fold your table napkin when you are up getting food.   Prices are standard, $50 for dinner for all-you-can-eat meats + salad bar.   I think the meats here are on the saltier side (some cuts more than others), so I prefer the meat at Fogo de Chao better, though I strongly prefer the salad bar at Texas de Brazil. Plus, Texas de Brazil salad bar has lobster bisque!  Overall, a great place to come when celebrating a special occasion."}
{"text":"PROS :great service you dont have to beg for meat they will come to your table offering you for meat s much as they can, ellegant place  at a reasonable price ...its a all you can eat reastaurant for 50 buks  CONS : too loud when tey are busy  so itsd hard to comunicate with your waitress and company too dark you need a good pair of eyes so see the menu  and meat ( including the one in the salad bar its too salty im not a fan of salty food so i guess its relative )"}
{"text":"Came in to celebrate my hubby's birthday and while the food was delicious the service was impeccable. Patricia was friendly and professional and with her service alone I will definitely be back! The meat was amazing and the salad bar was to die for, highly recommend the lobster bisque. So if you're looking for a wonderful dinner with a loved one this is definitely a place to go!"}
{"text":"Lauren was our server and we had a party of six including a two-year-old. She was nice and cordial but we had three birthdays and she charged us for two of the birthday desserts. How come a high-priced restaurant like this be so cheap. I saw they charged $49.99 for the baby and I had her take that off. She eats next to nothing and the two females only eat chicken and salad. It's still one of my favorite places to dine but they nickel and dime you."}
{"text":"This place has lost my business, ordered take out and they didn't even have my order when I showed up #poorcustomerservice"}
{"text":"No I'm sorry I won't be back!! For the amount of money we spend at the place in one visit with a party of 10 or more always. With drinks and dessert you could one time make an exception. Greed is a disgusting trait!!  Keep your Texas de Brazil."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this interesting restaurant concept, but the experience left me feeling eh...   The salad bar was ok, the meats were ok, the service was ok, the drinks were over priced ($12 for a top shelf gin and 7 up), the desserts were ok but slow to arrive and overpriced ($9). I am far from cheap, but when a restaurant charges a $45 pp admission fee, the over priced drinks and desserts add insult to injury.  I left with the feeling of not much bang for the buck..."}
{"text":"We came in on a Saturday night at 7:00pm with no reservation. Wait was about 30 minutes. Salad bar was very satisfying, flavorful and with plenty variety. The meat selection was ample. My personal favorite was the flank steak! Staff is very attentive to your needs. Our waiter was great! Only downfall is that fountain drinks, such as Coke, are NOT free refills and it is not stated anywhere, so when you get your check, you'll see multiple drink charges. They serve everything in wine glasses with 3/4 filled with ice. Would be back, but would definitely have to be in the mood for a lot of meat."}
{"text":"Went for my birthday dinner.  First time there.  It was fantastic.  The food and service were wonderful.   Would go everyday if I could.  Now I just have to figure out how to have more than 1 birthday in a year"}
{"text":"I'd say this wasn't the best experience as far as Brazilian steakhouses go, I felt that the food took very long compared to other places, they couldn't get food temperatures right even though they asked how we wanted steak done it seemed like a hassle for them, drinks took a while to get refilled, Some servers had a semi attitude, and seemed a bit understaffed. Been to several others and didn't have this type of experience.  The salad bar was good and some of the meat was as well, but I feel competitors offered a better experience and cuts of meat. Don't think they offered filet which was a let down."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this Brazilian steakhouse, as well as other locations of it, dozens and dozens of times. It is one of my favorite restaurants. The salad bar has almost 60 items. You must be careful to not fill up on the salad bar before the meat starts to come around. My favorite items from the salad bar are the lobster bisque (my favorite of any restaurant, and *always* the \"soup of the day\") and the potatoes. When you are ready for the meat, you turn over your card from red to green on your table. The several servers come around and offer you meats such as filet mignon, flank steak, lamb, pork, chicken, and sausage. Secret: You must ask for the yummy beef ribs. For some reason, the restaurant does not like to bring them around as they do with the other meats. You also get a few side items--mashed potatoes, fried banana, and cheesy bread, brought out to your table (included in the overall price). They offer several desserts for an additional fee. I notice that this location heavily pushes drinks at the end of the meal. I have been to many other Brazilian steakhouses, and Texas de Brazil is my favorite one."}
{"text":"Lunch: $32.99 per person. $19.99 if you only want the salad bar.   Dinner: $49.99 per person. $24.99 if you only want the salad bar.   I recently met with a group of friends here and a few of us had already written reviews for this place yet noticed they were gone. Strange. Hubby and I have been fans of this place for years. I just wish they'd open one closer to me! This place gets packed at night and especially on weekends. The menu says Texas de Brazil is a Brazilian-American Churrascaria that combines the cuisines of Southern Brazil with the generous spirit of Texas.   The salad bar here is effing amazing. Probably designed to fill you up to eat less meat, but I could honestly come here fore the salad bar alone. The menu says 50-60 options and I'd have to agree. The grilled provolone is one of my favorites and there's a good amount of savory hot dishes as well.   They give you a round card that you flip to green when you are ready for carvers to bring by some of that steak, lamb, chicken, pork and Brazilian sausage. The bacon wrapped chicken, sausage and garlic sirloin are my faves. The meal also comes with sides of mashes potatoes, sweet fried bananas and cheese rolls. The little cheese rolls are so good! I've never had room for dessert, but there is a dessert menu. The staff is very friendly and professional. Definitely a great spot for a variety of occasions. I'd recommend buying a VIP Dining Card when they are available for a limited time each year so you can save money on visits, just keep in mind they are only redeemable until the expiration date.   HH is Mon-Fri from 4-7pm."}
{"text":"If you're staying on the strip, this place is definitely worth taking a cab to eat here. Food and service was perfect. The lamb chops, filet, and lobster bisque were awesome. I'll be back for sure the next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"Too cold sitting atmosphere. Inexperienced staff,  WORST experience in dining EVER. This was our first couple night out in quite awhile. We were given  a generous gift card for a Christmas present,by our daughter s wonderful boyfriend.  He had heard us discussing how much we wanted to try this restaurant. We decided to go on a Sunday night. As my husband is in the industry and knew this would be a slower night. We made reservations for dinner. We arrived and were asked was this our first time eating here. We answered yes. We then were left on our own for most of the rest of the night. We thought after salad we would be looking forward a wonderful array  of meat. We were left again alone. No meat. We were so hungry , cold.  We decided to just leave. When we tried to get our check the worst of our experience awaited. The hostess was confused as to why we were leaving. We explained that we had been sitting for over an hour with no dinner. She was shocked and seemed genuinely upset. She couldn't settle our bill without a manager. They were rude poorly trained and cold care less. We were charged 80 dollars for. \" SALAD\".  No way would I ever recommend this place. I will spread the word as to the terrible customer service. Establishments should try to stop hiring children as managers. I can't imagining charging someone for a terrible experience."}
{"text":"As always, great food.  The service....VERY disappointing.... The hostess who seated us must hate her job. Total lack of a personality.  Our server....remembered him from our last visit and complimented him on how awesome he was....did a total 180 this time. A TOTAL dud. (I was prepared to tip very nice due to our past experience. Too bad, you left an extra 20 in my pocket.... He ruined a special occasion...not sure if we'll ever return.  Too many great restaurants in Vegas to have another disappointing experience."}
{"text":"MEAT LOVER'S PARADISE  So far this place is the best Brazilian buffet in Vegas. The meats are well cooked and everything flavored correctly. The service is exceptional. It does all come at a high cost, but its comparable to the pricing of Vegas buffets on the strip. My favorite non meat dish has to be the plantains!"}
{"text":"Meat lovers paradise! Great flavor, service and ambiance. We love Peter! His service is superb! House sirlion is on point! From the moment we walk in the hostess are professional and seat us in a timely matter with lots of smiles. Management is always aware of whats going on. Any request made is a priority. Forget any fine dining restaraunt, just come here! Hands down the very best churrascaria in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This past Saturday my husband insisted that we have lunch here. Once we finished with our just ducky tour we still had about 30 minutes to go. I thought this might deter him however he was very determined to have his steak and eat it too ( pun intended)  If you're in the mood for something special please please check this place out yes the prices are pricey but you can pretty much get a good sense of that from the outside. I have been to a restaurant very similar to this in San Antonio Texas and they really do not disappoint. If you were any kind of meat connoisseur and just really generally like food you will find this restaurant right up your alley. The salad bar that they have in the middle of the restaurant is a meal all in itself serving everything from rice and beans, to fresh vegetables and shrimp! My daughter was also impressed at the bowl of random bacon that was strategically place next to the bread yes bacon!  This restaurant will give  you a taste of all of the meat you can think of lamb, chicken, and beef. When you enter the restaurant and are seated it is explained to you in depth how everything works if your coaster is on the green they will continuously walk past your table and offer you various cuts of meat to include Brazilian sausage, I love sausage  Again this place is a little pricey but it's definitely worth the extra stretch if you're planning on eating here I do recommend that you come very hungry because if you don't you will have wasted approximately $30.  All in all my service was very good and I am glad this is where my Saturday lunch landed."}
{"text":"Interesting and inviting decor and concept but we felt like we were in SNL skit as it unfolded.  Influenced by my almost vegetarian spouse we agreed the salad bar was pretty good.  Then the meat kept coming on oversized skewers by men in gaucho pants and we felt obligated to keep smiling and submitting to the next chunk of wildebeest.  Smiles became more sarcastic as time went on.  Now for the price point... no cocktails, no desert and with a $20 coupon the bill for two was still $100+ with tip.  Not convinced they compete in terms of fine cuisine with independent locally owned restaurants, but they can fill you up.  Best suited for a hungry rugby team!"}
{"text":"Wow for my bachelor party my groomsmen took me out to dinner and we went to Texas de Brazil. This restaurant was amazing. The meat they serve here is top notch. From the sausage to the beef to the lamb it was all delicious. I love lamb pops and almost want to steal the sword with all of them on there. The pre buffet is really good too my friend will rave about the lobster bisque soup all day but with many options everything is worth it. I just saw they have a location near me in Irvine CA so guess one day I'll be going there over and over."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food and the evening dinning. The one thing I think a lot of people miss is that when you are being presented so many options that the conversation in our groups has always been very lively. The meats speak for themselves. Now you should have a bowl of lobster bisk and a pitcher of sangria."}
{"text":"Technically, this should be no stars as it was so bad we didn't even make it to the food. My fiance and I went here tonight for a celebratory dinner. We were about 15 minutes early for our reservation and they weren't quite ready for us so we figured we'd grab a drink at the bar while we waited.   The bar was not very busy but it still took a surprising amount of time for the bartender to even acknowledge us. There were quite a few fruit flies buzzing around and when we finally ordered our drinks (both of which were from their cocktail menu - so things they SHOULD have had) I was told they didn't have the bourbon for the drink I ordered. Not a big deal as the bartender suggested a substitute, but it seemed like it was an inconvenience for her. She made my drink and part of my fiance's drink when she brought mine over and told my fiance that they were out of the lemonade for her drink. She then put mine down and walked away before we could order a different drink.  Eventually we did get a replacement drink order  but almost immediately noticed dead fruit flies in it. There were not only a few dead flies IN the drink, there were noticeable parts of flies floating ON it. When I pointed this out to the bartender she copped an attitude about it.  The drink had only had one sip taken from it so it's not like we were running a scam, but despite the large fly my fiance had fished out and dropped on a napkin the bartender still seemed fairly incredulous. The couple next to us wasn't having much luck either and at this point the meat they were bringing to the tables smelled odd and we just decided to leave (the table was also still not ready and we were now about 10 minutes past our reservation time). The bartender did eventually come back and made a big show of ripping up the old bill like she was doing us a favor by comping the one drink but really, rather than being proud of ripping up the old bill, she should have been embarrassed about serving a drink like that.  We left and told the hostess to go ahead and cancel the reservation on the way out. The hostess mentioned  that the table \"wasn't that far behind schedule\". We told her that wasn't why we were leaving and my fiance asked to speak to the manager. The hostess said the manager was unavailable as they were helping at the bar. We just laughed and left and will not be giving it a second try. If the bar is that dirty and generally bug infested, I can't imagine what the kitchen is like. No thank you!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Our waitress was on top of it. Very prompt. The drinks were great and strong! lol I loved how juicy the meats were. Didn't really care for the pork tenderloin. But service from everyone is awesome and the atmosphere is relaxed."}
{"text":"I had a free entree coupon for my birthday so we figured we would give the newest Brazilian steak house in town a try.    Upon entering, I was immediately struck by how cold and unwelcoming it felt.  It was rather industrial in decor and seemed like they were trying too hard to be trendy.  We were the first table seated for the evening, so everyone was eager to bring food, drinks, etc.    First, drinks are very expensive.  Not that I didn't expect that given the type of meal and location, but $2.50 for a non refillable eight ounce bottle of coke seems a bit extreme.  The salad bar looked impressive, but I was expecting more.  Everything I tried was decent, but nothing jumped out as remarkable.  I was also hoping for more than just one type of sushi.  I felt the same way about the meats.  It did not seem that there was the variety that there were at other Brazilian steak houses that I have been to.  All of the meat was decent, but none stood out as favorites.  If I did have to name a favorite, it would be the lamb chop.  It seemed that rather than have a variety of meats and flavors, the same flavors were put on two or three different meats.    Service was exceptional.  Constant refills on water, meat, etc.  We were also visited twice by managers to ask if everything was OK with our meal and if we needed anything.  Overall an OK experience, but not worth what the price would have been if we paid for two dinners.  Next time I want a Brazilian steak experience, I'll stick with Green Forest in Penn Hills."}
{"text":"A little disappointing. Very similar to Fogo which I have gone to on a lot of occasions. The biggest difference for me is the bananas. Here they are not edible vs being my favorite thing at Fogo. Still good just not as good. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Food is outstanding (lamb chop was a bit gamey for my taste but everything else is phenomenal) l! The wine selection is unbelievable but the service isn't exactly desirable. Been here twice and disappointed with the waitresses ONLY. Everyone else is great (hostess, servers of meet)"}
{"text":"Fabulous!!!!! OMG the filet mignon is out of this world and the salad bar has so many choices. Love the lobster bisque!! Service is top notch! Will be visiting more often, it's worth every penny!"}
{"text":"This is truly a meat lover's paradise. We went here with a coupon that we received after signing up for the mailing list (apparently this is the smart way to dine here). Servers were pretty attentive and helpful in getting us started with our first time here. As we first started out, we were pretty much swarmed with all different cuts of meat. It was cool at first, though as we ate through I think it would've been preferable to eat more slowly and get our food a bit at a time. The red/green indicators that we had were pretty much ignored most of the time--they were on red at the beginning when we were swarmed, and then for the 15 minutes afterward as well, though the gauchos still kept asking us whether we wanted more. Later on, it seemed that they got tired of us and stopped asking, so even when I turned mine back to green I had to be a bit proactive in getting food.   The food itself was overall very tasty. My favorite cuts of meat were probably the picanha, filet, and lamb chops--super tender, lots of flavor. At the beginning we wanted to sample everything, though later on we realized that there really is no need to. Use your judgment and just get the ones you feel good about. One particular cut was rather dry and we realized that it looked that way as well. Other than the meats, the sides were fantastic, especially the cheese bread and fried bananas. The unlimited salad bar was top notch as well, which included a lot of different cheese and cold seafood options. Great way to balance out all that meat. Though your wallet might want you to eat like 90% meat to get your money's worth, your stomach would be much happier if you kept that down to like 40-60% and fill up the rest at the salad bar."}
{"text":"This is one of the best meals I've had in a while, and I only ate from the salad bar... the choices are endless for both vegetarians and meat eaters, with both hot and cold food options on the salad bar, as well as fried bananas and mashed potatoes delivered to every table. From the salad bar, I was able to try a variety of meats and cheeses, vegetables, and side dishes. They also had soup, fish, and rice with beans in hot trays as a part of the salad bar, which was a great touch. Other members of my party did try the meats, and they raved about the quality of every single one. The service was also wonderful, I was very impressed with the promptness of the different servers making rounds through the restaurant to serve the meat. We did not try dessert, but that's definitely something I have planned for a future visit. It was truly a memorable meal, and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"If you've never been to Texas de Brazil, you're in for an experience unlike most others. Contrary to a typical dining experience where you order from the menu, at TdB you take a seat, order your beverage and the food is served on the spot. Your table will be approached continuously by numerous servers each offering a prepared selection of meat: bacon wrapped filet mignon, BBQ flank steak, beef rib, garlic sirloin, lamb chops, rotisserie chicken, sausage, pork loin and more. The flank steak stood out as the best of the bunch. If you've eaten too much, flip over a marker that informs the server you're full; they wont offer any more. Flip it over when you're hungry again and the meat keeps a comin'.   A salad bar is available with a large selection of prepared salads, meats. cheeses and some salmon. You can build your own salad as well, but I found it to be lacking most of the basic ingredients of a typical salad: chopped tomato (Or cherry tomato), diced onion, cucumber, spinach, black olive and egg. Yes, they have bacon bits and croutons. You can however get creative and just top off the lettuce with some of the prepared salads and lay dressing over the top (Meh?). A prepared chick pea salad seemed to help. They offer sliced tomato, but it seems odd to lay it on top of a salad. It's meant to be tasted with fresh mozzarella and balsamic.  A hot-station has au gratin potatoes, fish, beans and a couple other options. Don't fill up on all these offerings however; you'll need room for the abundance of beef, pork. chicken and sausage. At this particular location, it was very busy and our service was sub-par. The people seated in the middle of the restaurant were getting flooded with meat offerings. We were set off to the side and spent several minutes waiting for someone to come over. The server offered me another glass of club soda. What he didn't tell me is that I'd be charged $3.50 for every glass. Most restaurants will charge you for the first glass and give refills for free. Not at TdB. I spent over $10 on three glasses of club soda: nice way to run up the bill mr server. When finished, we waited a long time for our plates to be cleared and for desert to be offered.   For desert I ordered Creme Brulee and a glass of Chalk Hill Chardonnay ($13 for the wine...not bad). The Chardonnay however was served in a water glass shaped somewhat similar to a wine glass. This glass is not suitable for wine though. What happens when you order a 1995 Chateau Latour for $2500? Do they serve it in a water glass????  As this is unacceptable, I went to the bar in search of a wine glass (I wasn't willing to wait around for our server to return.) When I went to the bar, I expecting to see a fine collection of wine glasses (They have top-dollar bottles on that wine menu). Low and behold, there are none. I asked the bartender if they had a wine glass. She handed me a water glass. I informed her that this is a water glass and that I needed a wine glass. After some scrambling, she produced a Bordeaux glass. Ahhh.....they do have wine glasses, but only for those who spend the big bucks. On the table to our right, they ordered a bottle a wine. Yes, it was served in water glasses. I guess they didn't spend enough money.  The Creme Brulee was fine, but not above average. I should have ordered the cheese cake. Aside from banana cream pie, the other offerings wouldn't have paired up well with the wine (Chocolate cake?).  Many people have complained about TdB meats being too salty. I understand why this is a so. Many of the meats, but not all, are seasoned about as much as possible without it being over-seasoned. For some folks, this will come across as tasting like sea water on the palate. IMO, it was a touch on the salty side, but not to the point of error. Perhaps on some days they get a little carried away with the seasoning. They probably have seasoning shakers in the kitchen. If careless, it would be easy to ruin a good dish.  I think you should experience TdB. The experience is unique and everything is well prepared. That being said, it's clearly over-priced. Our meal was 50% off and I still spent $65 including tip: $25 for the meal, $13 for the wine, $10 for the club sodas and $9 for the desert. I don't care how you slice it; it was not a $95 meal. They served my wine in a water glass. LOL. TdB is much like a buffet, but instead of walking up to it, the buffet comes to you...and it's all meat. Try it one time and decide for yourself if you'll go back. Pay the $50 for the meal, buy a drink and skip the desert. I would go back, but order cautiously.  If you're thinking of taking a date here, think twice unless you are certain that person is a die-hard meat lover. Of course, you could pass on the meat and just order the salad bar.....$20."}
{"text":"The food was great and very fresh.Lamb was Awesome amd my favorite.The cinnamon sugar bananas outstanding.The staff all were very friendly and informative.The lobster bisque was nasty.I made a reservation and highly recommend this we still waited 5 to 10 min but not an issue at all.Sign up on the website for coupons.The bread with the cheese they give you is awesome"}
{"text":"Great customer service when you step in the door! I have a peanut allergy and the waiters made sure to check everything before serving it to me. Even if they thought it had been processed in the area, they advised me not to try it. My experience here was AWESOME! I'll be back."}
{"text":"This was a great experience. Customer service was awesome and the food was spectacular as usual. Even tried a few new items on the menu that I had no ideas about.   The server was very great with making sure any of the dessert that I had didn't have nuts due to my. It allergy."}
{"text":"I came back again as promised. Came for dinner to experience all the meats and was not disappointed. I think I tried every meat. My favorite was the bottom sirloin and the sausage. The food was great and I ate until I couldn't take another bite. This is by far the best Brazilian steakhouse I've ever had and it is a must visit for any meat eater."}
{"text":"I've been so keen to try this place as everyone has been raving about it, and I would say it is good!  This was my first time at any churrasco place, so it was definitely different than what I'm used to when it comes to AYCE. Servers go around with different meat that you can try, which is pretty cool. But if there's a certain meat you really like & want more of, you have to wait til they come back around to your table.  Meats were good & tasty. Some were too salty for my taste, but everything was really good. There's a buffet table with sides, salads, veggies, soups, etc. that you can go up to as frequently as you like. Their lobster bisque was really good.  One major downside is that dessert ISN'T included in the price! You'd think after paying $50/person for dinner would include dessert, unfortunately, that's not the case =/  It's obviously not a restaurant I'd go to frequently due to their price & amount of food one could consume, but it's definitely a good place to go to for special occasions.  Word of advice:  - Don't eat too much sides as you'd want to get your money's worth on the meat. - Eat each meat as you get them. If you wait (which sometimes takes them a while to get to your table), the quicker you'll get full."}
{"text":"I cant understand....no fathom. I cannot fathom how Texas de Brazil is capable of receiving less then five stars. This place is a carnivores paradise and an ethical vegans worst nightmare. So much meat is paraded upon the floors of this place one could assume sacrifices to the meat gods were made here. This may be true...  The meat options are numerous. Filet Mignon, Bacon wrapped Filet Mignon, chicken, lamb chops, the list is impressively long. Your servers will be roaming the floors constantly with an infinite supply of skewered options so be on the lookout. Your meat will be prepared the way you want it and all you have to do is ask. An endless supply of delicious bread balls of happiness are sent to your table along with fried bananas and mash potatoes. Honorable mention also goes to the best salad bar potentially in Las Vegas. Lobster bisque, an assortment of cheeses and excellent couscous are just a small part of their master operation. Yes, even the palace of steaks caters to those that prefer lettuce.   Desserts are beyond good. The Brazilian Cheesecake is an addiction made manifest. The Brazilian Papaya Creme is a good back up option and of course Creme Brulee if you must. During this Bazaar of Beef be sure to order a Brazilian soda purely because they exist and need to be consumed.    5 Stars for this paradise of meat. Be ready to eat and bring a friend to carry you out."}
{"text":"This is a great Brazilian steak house. Similar to most where you have skewers of meat non stop until you turn your card from green to red. Taste of meats were better than Others I experienced.Salad bar and other food is better than others I have been to. Come hungry but expect to spend a good amount like most Brazilian steakhouses."}
{"text":"The prime rib and flank steak were absolutely delicious. THe best lobster bisque I have ever had  our waitress was wonderful and the meat servers were quick and attentive. At one point we were looking for one kind of meat and one of the servers asked what in particular we wanted. Then that server came directly to our table.  Very reasonably priced for the cuts of meat and the perfect way they cook hem.  Next time I'll stay away from the salad bar ( except for the lobster bisque)."}
{"text":"Texas de Brazil is a slightly above average Brazilian steakhouse. The meats are fantastic as they should be and the gauchos are all over it! The bar's options are a little light on the truly Brazilian accompaniments (sushi is not a typical Brazilian steakhouse side). The server was fantastic and the manager checked on all of the tables during their visits which is always pleasant (as long as it's genuine which his was). They only fair warning and I don't know if it was just an off thing, the floors were SUPER SLICK so if you're toting around in 4.5\" stilettos like I was - be careful. I didn't go down but I was walking like an idiot just so I wouldn't.  We will probably be back because you can never get enough picanha!"}
{"text":"Arghhhhhhh. I (mostly) try to stay away from red meat but this place is a definite \"TREAT YO'SELF\" spot when it comes to meat.   Bacon wrapped filet mignon. Lamb chops. Flank steak. Pork loin. (Minus 1 star for them not having PRIME RIB when I was there!!!!!)  And all come to you table over and over and over again like a vicious delicious juicy cycle.   Then there's the salad bar. OMG. I LOVE SALAD. SO MUCH. u don't even know! I was considering just the salad bar for dinner but, they told me they would have prime rib (lies!) as a meat choice.   Anyways, back to the salad bar. CHEESE. Cheesy bread. Mash potatoes. SWEET BANANAS --- those bananas changed my life!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I could, literally, eat just the sweet bananas with rice and salt. (How Filipino am I right!!?) lol"}
{"text":"This is a great Brazilian steakhouse option for Pittsburgh. If you have never been to a Brazilian steakhouse before and you don't mind spending around $80-$100 for two people, I highly recommend that you try this place."}
{"text":"My wife took me here for my birthday... The Bad: The meat was so salty we could hardly eat it. We ate a little bit of it and about 10 minutes later our bellies felt like balloons. We were so physically uncomfortable we had to cut the meal short and left. We felt bloated for almost 2 days. I complained to the server about the saltiness, his response, priceless.. \"I'll let the kitchen know so that when you come next time it might be better.\" REALLY??? I can't make this stuff up! It was my birthday and I didn't want to ruin the night. I paid the bill and figured that I would contact management the next day assuming that they would want to compensate me in some way. No response from management or corporate by phone or email. They truly don't care about their customers, obviously focused on 'location, location' is all that matters.  The Good: Salad bar presentation was good. The quality was good & fresh.  I couple weeks later we went with some friends to Fogo De Chao... Awesome all the way across the board. Pay the extra $3.00 and do it right at Fogo."}
{"text":"A bit pricy but it's the best food I've had in Vegas and their desert is amazing as well! They also have a military discount."}
{"text":"Really good food and be ready to stuff yourself. First the salad bar is great plus all the bread, potatoes, and sugar coated bananas. But this is a trick to make you fill up on the small stuff. You need to save room for the meat. they have a great variety of meats, all very salty but tasty. The service was good but the place is packed and very loud. Not a great place for a first date or a business meeting. But great if you want to stuff your face with some friends. The $50 a person is a bit pricey especially since that does not include a drink or desert.  But it is still worth it. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for our anniversary, and I returned a week later to treat my employees to something special. The service and quality of the food were remarkable both times. The salad bar is fresh and fabulous, but hey, you need to fill up on lots of different meats-don't fill yourself on leafy greens like a rabbit would. The servers never made me feel like my requests for a certain meat were bothersome-they just kept bringing it until I was done. This place is 5 stars+, just a bit pricey, but well worth the experience. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Went in last night to celebrate our engagement ! Suellen was an amazing server ! As well as the rest of the staff . My fiancé absolutely loved the salad bar and the variety they had. It's hard for me to choose what was my favorite between the lobster bisque , sangria , or the cheesecake we had for dessert. My only complain is that some meats were a little salty but when I got a second round of certain cut they weren't so maybe it was just that one round . I'll know next time I give this place another go !"}
{"text":"I'm conflicted about this place. On the one hand I like the ambiance and the meat quality is good. On the other it is pricey and for what you pay the salad bar is limited and the meats you want hardly make their way to your table.   I think more than anything else, they need to focus on getting the various cuts of meat out to the entire restaurant. I understand, of course, that this can be a challenge, but I think that goes back to planning.   Stay Cheerful ;)"}
{"text":"The wait service was not a great as our first time there.  The men presenting the meats were fabulous and food delicious. I still do recommend this place to friends.  We do have favorites the garlic steak along with the bacon wrapped filet and the list does go on  We will return"}
{"text":"Always a go-to when we want a nice family dinner for a special occasion! This time we needed to use up the last of our VIP discount card! Every single part of this dining experience is my favorite! Definitely don't go if you've had a big lunch!!"}
{"text":"They have a really good salad bar. I'm not too crazy about their meats. Their ribs are pretty good. The service could definitely be better. I gave it 3 stars because of the salad bar."}
{"text":"I usually write very poetic, inspirational, and beautifully crafted reviews for everyone to read.(if you don't believe me check them out!) But in the case of this place I can't make any promises ... If you've ever seen me you'd know I'm no regular at salad bars. But this salad bar gets an A+++ in my book! I visited it so many times I had to start turning meat down! And I never do that!! (no homo) Speaking of meat, we had filet mignon, lamb, bacon wrapped chicken, and many others. All beautifully prepared!! I can't wait to visit again and shove all that beautiful meat in my mouth..(again no homo) if you've never been here you need to visit at least once. And if you're a true carnivore like me, you'll be back. Again and again and again..."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at a Brazilian steak house and I must say it was an excellent one! I have a few allergies so I let the restaurant know that before hand.  When we arrived the chef ( I believe his name was josh) came right up to my table and explained what I could and could not eat. He was so very helpful and polite. The buffet was well kept and the food was awesome. Just when I thought they really outdid themselves on came the meats! Excellent place and will definitely be returning and will definitely recommend to everyone I know."}
{"text":"As a lenient pescetarian, Texas de Brazil may seem contra proferentem, but that doesn't deter any semblance of review to be given. A solid five stars, teetering on the border of four and a half because I aspire for the rankings of Michael Kors, this establishment combines the diadem of service etiquette with an affluent diversity of cuisine, fulfilling both the hedonistic propensity of meat lovers and a conscience for the vegetarian diet.   Let's talk about the controversial matter peppered with bon mots -- pricing is fifty for those who identify as Indominus and half for those who get asked \"if you were stranded on an island, would you eat coconut palms or a cow,\" as if an organism exists in such ecology. This is Las Vegas. If you're pooling sweat over these rates, you might want to get a refund for that three-step easy online degree in geography and start your career in anthropomorphic fur-suit construction. You have come to this city in a pre-mediated agenda: to market yourself as some uber-chic cliché, re-create the events of the Hangover through an arrangement of poorly taken Snapchats, or maybe to meet someone with silicon implants for the first time; but, most of all, to drop a wallet like Beyonce drops an album out of nowhere. So, yes, you can swipe your card with impunity. Don't act like you haven't fed the slot machines your latest paycheck. There's no judgement here.  Normally, I'm against the American restaurant normative that will slaughter anything that walks on at least two legs -- I'm sure you've read Upton Sinclair before -- but unlike your typical factory chain, Texas de Brazil stands proud with a classy ambiance and setting. A giant chandelier, seen in the Old Hollywood Silent Noir; the qualities of a wine-house combined with an exclusive air of upper-class; a secretive bathroom, whose sinks are the definition of pretentious -- they're like vases. It makes Olive Garden look like a pathetic hole in the wall, so this ambiance is part of the price you're paying. After all, I bet their electric bill has two commas.   Now, I won't be shoving words into the mouthes of the carnivores because I know for a fact that they'll be shoving in slabs after slabs of thick, juicy meat. Talk about umami -- you can let it sit in your mouth and enjoy the flavor as the meat keeps coming and coming. For those who need a basic run-down of the protocol, I'll do you a solid: servers, with huge, thick, long, well-cooked, and lathered sticks of meat will walk by you and ask if you want a piece. Ooh la la. Swipe right on everything but the parmesan chicken -- I've heard it's salty in flavor, but to each their own taste, am I right? Now, if you're giving up after your second cut, the secret 411 is that some drone will abduct you and drop you off to a detox center where you'll realize how much money and meat you've wasted. After all, Area 51 is close by. The servers are relentless and will stop at nothing to make sure you've gotten your fill. To illustrate this phenomena, our large party of around twenty five followed the family tradition of prayer -- we have to be grateful, obvi. As I've learned in Screenwriting 101, sub-text is everything. And as we harmoniously prayed about the Lamb of God, servers brought freshly cooked lamb to the table.  To discuss the politics of omnivores yet evade vegetarians is offensive in every right. The coined term salad bar does not do justice to what is provided. Yes, there is salads -- in about three to four different variations; carbohydrates in all of their glory; seafood; and whatever else you want, they probably have it. Cool beans, right? A temperate ambiance, relative position to the Las Vegas scene, service, and the food combines to make a five star experience in Texas de Brazil. As a pescetarian, I firmly vouch for this restaurant."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Lack of people walking around with meat. Lack of steak options. Unseasoned meat. Very overpriced for the quality of food."}
{"text":"If you been to any Brazilian Steakhouse, this is very similar. We made reservations in advance on a Friday evening and there were several tables open and we were able to get right in.  Service was great.  The salad bar was ok, not as huge as some other places.  However, the chimichurri sauce at the bar with the meat was excellent.  My husband loves the meat.  My favorite was the top sirloin.  I prefer more well done meats vs. rare to medium.  They asked several times what my preference was and said they would heat up a bit more for me and would be back.  However, not once did they come back with my style meat.  It was ok though because they have so much variety of other meats to pick from.  Also, note their soda comes in bottles and you pay per bottle vs fountain style drinks with refills."}
{"text":"Impromptu business dinner with 5 of my colleagues and we ended up here.  Food was fine (although meat was often overcooked) but the service lacked MUCH to be desired.  At least 50% of the time the meat was carved from the skewer it fell off onto the table and then was picked up off the table (with no apology) and served to the guest.  Despite people's indicators clearly being \"red\", our conversation was repeatedly interrupted to ask if someone wanted more.  Drinks too a long time to come out (and, wow... we all remarked on what a bad selection of beers you had) and the blatant upselling by our primary server was ANNOYING!  Additionally, he (Matthew?) had no interest in what he was doing and was clearly just spouting what he was told to.    All in all, a frustrating experience.   Considering that we spent ~$600 for six people, you'd think the service would have been better.   I have expectation to return."}
{"text":"WHAT!?!  Crazy yum! This place is amazing.  Salad bar was wonderful, but don't fill up here. If you want the real experience then you came here for the MEAT!  I would suggest a day of fasting before you get here, you will not leave hungry (unless you are a vegan or vegetarian---((why are you here?)).  Grilled lamb, sausage, ribs, filet mignon, chicken, flank steak, sirloin, pork; so much meat. The grilled yum is carved table side. You may have rare, medium, well cooked or anything in-between, you choose.  Chebe bread ((it is gluten free pretty sure)) is on the table, round, warm, cheesy and perfect!  The wait staff was helpful and prompt. Restaurant is immaculate, and beautiful. Close to the strip, great location for locals as well as visitors. Yes there is free parking, in a lot. I know right?  We went on a Thursday night at about 7 with no reservations (we live dangerously) and only had to wait 20 minutes.  You must experience this place at least once in your life, seriously."}
{"text":"Day visited was 01.24 at dinner time.  Coming from someone who rarely eats red meat, it's delicious here! Totally worth the $50 a person. We went to eat here for my boyfriends birthday, when we got there the hostess asked if we were there for a birthday or anniversary and we said yes (since they asked I thought they were going to sing or something.. haha) once they sit you they explain everything.. which was still confusing! But you get up and go to the main dining room and get what you want, buffet style. Their sides, soups (lobster bisque in specific) mash potatoes, banana to cleanse your pallet between meats, papaya parfait are delicious! I tired so many different types of red meats, and chicken! The meat just melts in your mouth! The waitress wasn't too attentive but it wasn't a big deal. Overall, I would come here again!"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant. I came here for my holiday  Christmas party & was beyond surprised with how amazing the food was. The best salad bar ever & great quality food. Everything tasted fresh. The selection at the salad bar was exquisite. This is a great restaurant to bring family for a special occasion or for a romantic dinner. Great service & wonderful atmosphere."}
{"text":"Why go:   Because you love amazing Brazilian BBQ and aren't afraid to pay for it.    What did I put in my mouth: While there was great variety in the meats and cuts, I enjoyed the house special, Picanha, and Garlic Picanha.  The Alcatra was on par as well.  Sides are buffet style such as sauteed mushrooms, lobster bisque, salad bar, or jasmine rice.  Complimentary garlic mashed potatoes and cheese bread was equally tasty and welcome.  If it wasn't for Aria's buffet that we ate 6 hours earlier, I'm sure we would have put more of the meat down.    What did it cost: It's not Hometown Buffet so expect to pay some $$.  It was around $50 mark but for the quality and quantity of food, it is well worth it.  Play hard, eat hard.    How was the service: Lola was on point.  A hallmark of any good server is water never dips below half for too long and we are checked on if we are enjoying ourselves.  The servers with the meat skewers were fast to the table and variety abounds.    This is one of those places that I say I would go to more if it were closer but that's all BS.  It's a special little spot that is reserved when I can make it to Vegas because it's not in California.  I love Fogo, but this place edges it out.  While the buffets in Vegas are great, there's really nothing quite like exceptional Rodizio.....trust me when I say you won't disappointed...."}
{"text":"I gave this restaurant a 4 star review because of how great the service and the food was. My husband is Brazilian and we have spent a good deal of time in Brazil. This was very similar to steak houses in Brazil.  It was a little rushed with how quickly the meat kept coming out, but you have the green and red signals to let them know if they should stop at your table or not so you can pace yourself.  I ordered a mango caipirinha and that was the only aspect of the food/drink I was disappointed with. I generally don't order caipirinhas in the states because they don't come with muddled fruit, but the menu said it was made that way so I took a chance. They actually muddle lime (which I thought was strange since it was a fruit caipirinha) and then they put the fruit juice on top of it. That was the only thing I wouldn't recommend here.  The reason I am rating this restaurant lower than a five and considered a three was the level of noise. There was a big group in the back that was cheering and screaming for the majority of our meal. It was a little bit like having dinner in a noisy Chuck E Cheese. I could tell we weren't the only table disappointed that we were not able to hear anything except the big party. My disappointment wasn't as much with the fact the party was being disruptive, but that no one came around to apologize and it didn't seem like anything was being done to make sure the rest of the guests were still able to enjoy their meals."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Our waiter Wesley was very attentive and made sure our experience was great.   My friend had made a reservation for 5:30PM and we arrived a little bit earlier and only waited for about 5 minutes. Since it was my first time here, Wesley took the time to explain to me how everything works. You have a small double-sided card that is colored red on one side and green on the other. Red means no more meats, green means give me more. The meat servers are constantly walking around checking each table.  There is also a salad bar which consist of their daily soup, which was lobster bisque that night, a ton of sides, and a giant cheese wheel of grand padano (my favorite cheese :D) they also had some dried meats like salami and prosciutto.  Now for the meats! They are generally served medium rare but if you have a preference you can just tell them and they will make it for you. My favorite had to be the beef ribs. Pretty much anything that was beef lol. I couldn't remember the specific names of the other meats but the beef rib was very memorable Oh my gosh it literally melted in my mouth, I think I was like drooling oil from it lol. I also really enjoyed the sausage and parmesan crusted chicken! Everything was just so delicious. Also, they give you some cheese-filled bread balls, garlic mashed potatoes and fried plantains to clean your palate so you can taste everything better. I think I was the only one among our group who destroyed those garlic mashed potatoes.  I'm definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"The meats were delicious and kept coming, the staff was superb,  and the \"salad bar\" is really a buffet in and of itself. Loved the ambience."}
{"text":"I have been here about five times, never disappoints. Meat is always spot on. Servers are great. Upscale feel to the place. Salad bar is too good in my opinion, I eat too damm much from it and then I can't fill up on meats. The cheese bread balls are delectable. The cheesey potatoes at salad.bar are au gratin delicioso. A little pricey, but for that special occasion or when you want to be a carnivore this is the place. My favorites were the flank steak, and bacon wrapped filet mignon."}
{"text":"This restaurant has something for everyone, you will not leave hungry! Everything I had for dinner was cooked and seasoned perfectly. The servers were courteous and patient. Great place, could be a bit pricey for some."}
{"text":"Second time at the Westlake location. First experience was better than the second which was for a birthday. Made it aware that we were celebrating a birthday and they did nothing as we have seen they do for others. No big deal, had dessert somewhere else. Salad bar, good but seemed to lack since the first visit. It took forever for the servers to come around with the meat, which did not taste too flavorful and for what you spent we probably each only ate a few servings of meat because service was slow."}
{"text":"Have been to other Brazilian restaurants. Salad bar was great, wide selection of different salads, cheeses, meats, soup, and much more. As far as the different meats go, after eating them they all start to taste the same. Tables are a little too close together, had to wait a bit for the meat, then when they came by only a certain meat temp would be available as far as if it was rare, medium, well done. The fried bananas are amazing. Overall it is a nice restaurant but if you are ever in Chicago Chama Gaucha is a must."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! Salad bar, rodizio meat selections, service, ambiance just everything is wonderful here! We love coming here for special occasions or if we're craving really good rodizio meat. Reservations are recommended especially on weekends. It definitely gets busy here since they are located minutes from the the strip. Great place for tourist and locals. Again... AMAZING food!!! GO HERE! :)"}
{"text":"I go a dozen times a year, despite the price. It is $55/person. However, it is definitely worth every penny!  They have the best steak in town and the smartest set up around.  At your table each person gets a card with green on one side and red on the other. If you flip to green, a plethora of meats comes your way and you get to choose however much you want. They have lamb, assortment of steaks, chicken, etc. You flip it to red and they stop coming by.  The salad bar is a free for all and has such things as cheesy potatoes, sushi, a bacon bowl, rice, veggies, etc.  If you go hungry, you will leave completely satisfied! Seasoning: PERFECT! You couldn't make it any better. Customer Service: Fast, attentive, great knowledge of everything from taste to procedure Ambiance: A bit packed but comfortable and you get a family feel  GET THE PICHANA! You will not regret it. Filet mignon is good, they have regular and garlic...love the garlic one. The sausage is pretty good. The flank is nice as well, but that pichana is LIFE!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday evening with a group of 25. We had a reservation, got seated, and served fast all while it was packed! Great atmosphere, good food and good hospitality."}
{"text":"This place is literally fantastic!! Huge 50 item salad with everything on it from salad, to lobster bisque, to sushi! The meats are seriously to die for, and they are never ending! It was a bit over crowded and most of the guests were dressed super casual (which I thought was kinda inappropriate) but I will certainly be back!!!"}
{"text":"The manager Kyah was just the sweetest, nicest young woman I have ever met. She really made my family feel right at home. I would come back just to see her smiling face. Also, Craig the GM was a delight to speak with. Very nice managers and the service was quite delightful."}
{"text":"Today was my visit to Texas de Brazil. I don't normally like salad bars, but this one was very clean and everything looked fresh and tasted great.   The lamb was very good as was the bacon wrapped filet.  Everything was delicious.   The servers came around very often and there was no wait in between options."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner reservations here yesterday 4/28/18. One word comes to mind AMAZING! Our reservations was for 7:45 we had about a 15 minute wait, but they kept us in the loop and was very friendly and polite. The decor was very nice, the chandeliers were high end vintage with a dash of modern, wood tables with nice comfortable chairs, a big block candle burning on each table with white cloth lien napkins, and blue goblet drinking glasses and basic silverware. The salad bar area had everything from shrimps to lobster bisque soup. It's not your average salad bar, it was well prepared, maintained, and clean. They give you a basket of these little round ball style of rolls. I did not like, but my husband did. Meat, meat, meat all kinds of meat! Chicken wrapped bacon, filet migon wrapped bacon, chicken parmesan, pork parmesan, lamb chops, Brazilian sauage(my favorite), flank steak, ribs, etc. if you're a vegan or vegetarian stay home or go to another restaurant unless you don't mind friends/family eating meat in front of you. You can do salad bar only. My husband had two strawberry style Brazilian drink, it was strong and good. It was crowded around this time and the noise was a little loud with everyone talking. Lights are dimmed, so it's kind of romantic. It was our anniversary. They gave us one free dessert, we went with the banana foster to take home. It was tasty. This is a place I would go to once a year because it's way too much meat (lol). I would suggest that they have cards on each table letting the diners know the selections of meat for that day. They do ask is there a meat you would like them to bring over, but how would you know all the meats? Overall, a very pleasant dining experience and our waiter was very attentive and polite. I would recommend to family and friends."}
{"text":"Unless you truly crave that mineral, I would avoid this place. Nearly all of the meat was far too salty, despite mostly being cooked well. We found ourselves desperately grabbing bowls of sliced pineapple (the only fruit at the salad bar) just to give our mouths some relief. At $50 per person, it's kind of crazy that we could only eat a small subsection of the food. :("}
{"text":"This place is awesome the atmosphere is great, very spacious inside the restaurant. Food is amazing so much to choose from. The waiters are friendly and  the speed they bring meats on the swords are amazing. My favorite meats are filet mignon, brazilian sausage and lamb chops. Also got to try their fried banana absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"We came here after making a last minute reservation. They were busy but with a wedding party of 25 taking a whole room, I would be surprised if they weren't. As always their lamb was juicy and perfectly done. As much as the food was delicious, our server Adam was the star of the night. He was funny, delightful and attentive. He made sure our water was always filled, we had the meat cuts we wanted and all the side were  available."}
{"text":"The meats are absolutely the best. I have been there many times and he food is always top notch.  Their salad bar is amazing as is their Lobster Bisque."}
{"text":"Always fun at this place!  Great service and great meats as they always bring them out the way you like.  If something is not cooked the way you want they will fix it right away.  Convenient location and great service.  Charles is one of the best Gauchos and one of the reasons we come back! The Picanha and Lamb Chops are my favorite.  Salad bar is amazing also with all the cheeses available."}
{"text":"First time here.. I have nothing bad to say about this place!! It was spur of the moment, so we didn't have a reservation. Waited about 30 minutes for a table.. But there was a nice bar area to have a drink while we waited. The service was great!! The food was even better!!"}
{"text":"A lot of my coworkers and I made a reservation here for a goodbye party. We were promptly seated and our waiter was there quickly to fill our water glasses. Each person is given a button with a green side and a red side. Green means more food and red means stop.   The wine list leaves much to be desired. After looking at the choices I couldn't find anything remotely sweet (even a white zin would have done, I didn't need moscato or anything). I was told Pinot Grigio was the sweetest they had?!   The decor and atmosphere felt very upscale and classy.  After giving a drink order you can get up and go to the \"salad bar\". So this salad bar is not merely a salad bar. It had various soups, meats, cheeses, and stuff that I couldn't even guess on what it was. I stuck with a romaine lettuce salad with ranch (can't go wrong there) and some deli meat, grilled provOlone, and crackers. All of which were very fresh and tasty.   After returning to the table, the meats start coming around. And they KEEP coming around. The meats were all very good but some were chewy and less tender than I'd expect from a place like this. The filet was absolutely delicious as was the garlic sirloin!  Also at times the waiters came by so quickly that there was no way you could have stopped them for the meat if you wanted to. This became frustrating as it could be a while before that meat came around again.   For dessert I ordered the cheesecake per our waiter's recommendation and OH MY GOODNESS. It was the best cheesecake I've ever had. Definitely recommend!  Overall this was a great experience and I will be coming back on special occasions!"}
{"text":"great meats, excellent salad bar, cooperative wait staff, nuff said, would love to back again."}
{"text":"awsome delicious food. great service.must try the strawberry lemonade it is like a slushie"}
{"text":"Today Is Veterans Day 2018 and veterans received 50% off!  That is amazing!  What a Awesome  place, fun, great music!  That staff is very professional and always attentive to your needs!  It's really cool, you start with the salad bar / soups etc.    They bring unlimited rolls and mash potato  to your table & fried banana !  Wow  that's only the beginning!  Now comes the best part and that is many meats, lamb, chicken wrapped in bacon!   All as you select and delivered hot! So yum  yum  yum    Omg, you get so full, what great sources of protein!  The servers who brings the meats etc. to your table are dressed Brazilian style uniform! Very cool    You must save room for the incredible deserts!  Calorie overload, but tasty    Totally Amazing and totally bring a date, family, or friends!  A must go, you will love it"}
{"text":"This was chosen as the surprise dinner for my birthday on a Sunday evening around 7:00. I was very excited because I have heard a lot about this place and keep forgetting to go during restaurant week.  We had a reservation and waited maybe 10-15 minutes to be seated, but the place was packed and I don't think they set tables aside for reservations necessarily, but I would definitely make one because we noticed others waiting for a lot longer than we did.   The waitress was extremely busy so she ran through what they were all about and recommended some drinks. Throughout the meal, though, she did come back to refill drinks and such.   We went up to the salad bar first to check it out.  It's not your standard salad bar- there's sushi, cured meats, cheeses, pickled vegetables, bread, different dips and sauces, a huge cheese wheel that you hack away at to get a few bits, soups (lobster bisque yum), and side options for your meats like warm wine infused mushrooms. The salad bar portion featured only lettuce, marinated tomatoes, croutons, fried bacon strips, and salad dressings. They don't have all the toppings that you're used to at a typical salad bar- but everything tasted great and the salad dressings looked and tasted homemade.   When we returned, there were fried plantains and a bowl of awesome mashed potatoes to accompany our meats.  We flipped our cards to green and, even though it was packed, immediately every 5 or so minutes there'd be a different type of meat making its way to us.  The brazilian sausage was AMAZING, the garlic rubbed steak was awesome, as were the lamp chops and ribs.  The only thing we didn't care for that we tried was the Parmesan chicken - it is chicken thighs, which I am not a fan of. It was a little gamey and really greasy and not very good.  They also offered me a free dessert since I was celebrating my birthday- I chose creme brûlée which was delicious!  I really enjoyed this experience, but like so many others, you get more full then you've ever felt and tell yourself you will never go back because you've had enough. It's definitely, in my opinion, more suitable for a birthday, anniversary, or other special occasion, and not for everyday dining. However I would definitely return and bring some more family members merely to see their faces when presented with meat upon meat upon meat!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I really enjoyed our meal there least evening,  Food and service very good.   As far as the 'too much salt' complaints I've read:  1. They tell you straight up when you are seated how the meats are prepared. 2. if you want you meats prepared without salt, that can be done. You tell your waiter. It will take more time to prepare. That's on you.   If you're looking for a quiet spot, this isn't the place to go. If you're into a bustling atmosphere, make the trip.   Plenty to choose from at the salad bar. I will probably skip this next time and concentrate on crushing meats."}
{"text":"This place exceeded my expectations! There were so many delicious meat options - steak, chicken, pork, lamb - and the \"salad\" bar was expansive. The only issue is that the meat doesn't come around fast enough, and when it does you only get one slice/piece. So you basically get one small piece of meat every few minutes."}
{"text":"I usually don't give bad reviews, but my experience last night at this establishment was SO bad, that I had to find my rusty Yelp account to share my horrendous experience at this Texas de Brazil.  TL/DR: Waited too long to get subpar, inconsistent food. Terrible Service. Wasted 2.5 hours. They can't manage the place when big groups show up. Just hope that there are no big groups when you go in to dine."}
{"text":"The food and service were excellent! If I had to describe it, it would be like Nicolas Cage set up a bunch of mirrors so it looked like there were infinite mirrors then stood in front of them whispering \"Nicolas Cage\" until he fell asleep standing up."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant for a 7:00 dinner during Restaurant Week. This was the first time I'd ever been to a Brazilian churrascaria, and maybe I'm just easily impressed, but I LOVED this place.  We probably had to wait 5-10 minutes to be seated even though we had a reservation. It seemed like the restaurant is understaffed, as there was only one host and a manager was running around trying to help her out. It then took a good few minutes for one of the servers to take our drink order, but after that everything picked up in speed.  The website indicates the dress code is business or smart casual, but I saw a few dudes there in Harley tees, so it seems like basically anything goes. My husband and I were dressed in nice jeans and a blazer and a more casual dress, respectively, and didn't feel out of place.  I was kind of preparing to be disappointed with the meal, to be honest. Reading the selection of meats that are unlimited in your experience, I thought it was going to be a too good to be true situation.  It wasn't. Everything was delicious.   They serve all red meat medium rare, and being someone who usually orders meat cooked medium well, I was a little hesitant. I shouldn't have been. If you like your meat well done, tell the server and they will cut it from the outside, where it is cooked more thoroughly. I didn't bother requesting this though because I found that most of the meat was only a bit pinker that I am normally used to, but I enjoyed it just the same. The fillets were all cooked medium to medium well and are juicy but not bloody.   Yes, the meat is salty. I am a bit of a salt-a-holic, so it was just about perfect for me. That being said, by the end of the meal my lips did feel a little weird from eating all the salt!  My husband's favorite was the bacon wrapped fillet, I loved the house special, and our servers stopped by multiple times to ask if we wanted those cuts sent back over. As the staff mentions, any one of them is at your service. If you see any server, you can ask them for more plates, specific meats, drinks, water, dessert, even your check. They all work together and it seems to be a good system given the nature of the restaurant.  The salad bar looked delicious but I didn't take very much from it on this trip. I'm a red meat fan and was gearing up to a eat a lot of it, so I skipped things I would have otherwise enjoyed. Before coming to the restaurant, I couldn't imagine paying $25.00 just for the salad bar, but after seeing what it contains: sushi, salmon, greens, soup, rice, potatoes and your more standard salad items, I might just consider it.  We took our deserts to go--I was happy that the let us, some restaurants can be a bit strict during restaurant week promotions--key lime pie was awesome.  The meal was delicious, but if you eat the way we did, I can't imagine frequenting this place very often."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday for lunch. $50/person which includes a soft drink and slice of dessert!  Meat quality is good, cooked well for the most part. Comes with sides of plantains and mashed potatoes.   Plantains were eh, sugar crystally coat over the plantains.  Salad - pretty good items. Grilled garlic...mmmmm Lobster bisque was a little salty Cheese bread - okay. Nothing spectacular. I still love Fogo de Chaos cheese bread (popovers) a lot more  Dessert - pretty good too"}
{"text":"Visiting Pittsburgh from Chicago to see the Bears beat up on the Steelers and to enjoy an incredible meal at Texas De Brazil. Entering the steak sanctuary I was telenovela by the incredible atmosphere and the positive energy of staff and patrons. The salad bar was well presented but lacked the selection of other Brazilian banquets I have been blessed to experience. I loved the hospitality of our server Eddie and his knowledge of the entire menu. Unfortunately things took a turn for the worse about halfway through our experience. The Gauchos turned into 'Gone'choes. I had to ask multiple times for our server and water guy to find some meat. Steelers fans at the table next to us are placing the magical green coasters on their forehead in an attempt to get someone, anyone's attention. After requesting our check, we had to wait nearly 30 mins. I really, really wish that they could have had the stamina to create a great experience from door to door. While there were good aspects of the experience, I struggle to give Texas De Bra'slow' more than two snail pace stars."}
{"text":"I had a really nice experience here! We had a reservation, but we got there a little early and were seated immediately. Our server was friendly and attentive. The salad bar had a ton of interesting options to choose from and most of the meats that I tried were absolutely delicious! The only ones I didn't particularly care for were the chicken and the pork loin. I don't like lamb myself so I didn't try any of it, but my boyfriend did and he said all of the lamb options were fantastic. My favorite meat was the Brazilian sausage. Dinner was a little expensive at $45 a person, but for the variety and amount of food you can get it makes sense. Definitely would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is, hands down, my FAVORITE place to eat in Vegas.  I used to eat here at least twice a month. It's ALWAYS busy every time I go. However, week nights are not as busy compared to weekends. Make sure you call to reserve a table ahead of time! Or you can go online to make reservations.  In the salad bar, my favorites are the cucumber/onion salad and the au gratin potatoes. Tip: don't fill up on the salad bar if you plan on trying/eating a lot of the meats!  The servers bring each table a basket of cheese bread, mashed potatoes, and caramelized bananas. The cheese bread is good. So good, in fact, that my boyfriend wanted to go here JUST to fill up on the cheese bread. The potatoes were good as well, but it doesn't beat the au gratin potatoes that are offered at the salad bar. And the bananas are to be eaten in between meats because it's said to clear the taste pallet, so you're not mixing the tastes of the meats. But I just eat them up because they're really tasty.  There are a variety of meats (beef, lamb, pork, chicken, sausage, etc) and it's easy to get overwhelmed when you get offered half a dozen meats in a matter of minutes. My favorite will always be the house special: the picahna. It has some fat around the edges, which is my favorite part because it's PACKED with flavor. I always ask if they can cut multiple slices for me.  If you actually have room for dessert, I recommend the creme brulee. It's easily the BEST creme brulee I've ever had in my life.  My favorite part about Texas de Brazil is that the servers come around the tables and ask if there's a specific meat request you have. Within a few minutes, you'll have someone with that meat right at your table.   It is about $50 a person, but it is definitely worth every penny for the amount you eat, all the delicious flavors you experience, and the amazing service you receive."}
{"text":"We dined at Texas de Brazil during restaurant week, which was awesome because the meal was $10 off and it came with a dessert.  The restaurant was busy, but our waitress, Autumn, was completely on the ball. Our water glasses never went empty and she was conscious of what needed refilled on the table and asked several times if there was any particular types of meat we were looking for.  We ordered a pitcher of the house sangria, which was plenty enough for the three of us drinking it. My husband had the speciality mojito, which was also delicious.   The cold bar had an excellent variety of meats, cheeses, salads, sushi, and shrimp. We could not get enough of the cheese bread balls and the plantains! We could do without the mashed potatoes.  The meats were delivered regularly and everyone who came to our table was very friendly. They even accommodated numerous requests for our meat to be cooked to a higher temperature (the meat is typically cooked to medium rare). The quality is f meat was top notch (says my father the butcher). The beef rib fell off the bone and was a huge hit at our table. My husband also ate the lamb, which he said was delicious. They had a house special top sirloin and the seasoning was amazing!  Yes, the meat is very salty, but they explain up front that it's because of how's it's prepared (traditionally on a bed of rock salt).   This restaurant is everything we expected it to be: a meat lover's paradise."}
{"text":"I love this place!! This isn't my first time here, but it was for my husband. We went today for our wedding anniversary and he really liked it. The food selections are broad and the service is excellent. Very mellow ambiance here. Depending on your budget, it can be kind of pricey ($50/pp for dinner), but it's more of a special occasion type of place, imo. Overall, definitely plan to return again in the future."}
{"text":"As we were in vegas, I decided to make reservation for my husband's bday... Amazing service, amazing drinks, triple amazing dessert and even when I'm not a meat eater, I have to say the rice and beans are to die for.. I wish I remembered our waitress name, she was super funny and good waitress..."}
{"text":"Enjoyed pre-valentine dinner here with the fam last night. Very busy but it's nothing new. So glad I made the reservation in advance. Good food as usual. The lobster bisque was delicious and so in demand they ran out. It was replaced with cream of jalapeño which wasn't as good BUT This lady comes here for the MEAT, not the soup. I of course stuck with the beef and lamb. Everything was delicious and juicy. Wore my fat pants but still wished I had an extra stomach (haha).  Our server last night was Adam. He is amazing! He is like a mind reader who knows what you need before you even think it.   Good food, good service, 20% military discount. What else can I ask for? Oh, you get a $25 gift card for dining between 12Feb-17Feb as well."}
{"text":"My husband and I had reservations for dinner at 7:00 to celebrate Valentine's Day and one of our last dinners together for awhile since we have a baby on the way in a few weeks and a five year old at home so these date nights don't come to often. We arrived at 6:45 and were not seated until 7:45, which I'm not upset about because I was expecting a long wait for a busy night. The restaurant was packed which is understandable for Valentine's Day weekend so when we were seated right beside the entrance and where everyone was gathered waited to be seated, mind you it was 4 degrees out that night, I asked if we could possibly wait for another table elsewhere. We were told \"I assure you every table here is the same your food won't taste different elsewhere.\" So regretfully we sat there trying not to be a pain on such a busy night. Our whole dinner was interupred with people literally running right into our table or standing over top of us while they were waiting bumping into us the whole time or just staring at our every move, along with freezing when the door opened every few seconds. Our food was Cold bef ore it even made it into our mouths. We were told 6 times by different customers that they felt bad for where we were sitting. The food was good and our server was nice but finally having a night out and not even being able to hear eachother talk because of the large crowd next to us was very disappointing. It seemed like the servers only brought up the same 3 kinds of meat since we were in such a crowded hard to get area so when I asked for the bbq ribs on two different occasions they never came. I read on the review card to express your concerns before you leave the restaurant not in an email later so when I told the manager about our dinner he was distracted and simply said \"sorry\" and walked away. We paid the $120 For the nightmare dinner and went elsewhere to get dessert where we could be warm, hear eachother talk, and not be stared at the whole time. I then wrote an email to let them know about our experience since the manager did no seem concerned and my reply was that \"for special occasions they rent extra tables and place them where they have room. We must of got one of those tables. Sorry about our experience and offered us 10% off our next meal.\" No thank you we will not be returning."}
{"text":"The meat was good. Very clean and very good quality cuts of meat, that is if u can get them to serve your table.  Seems like tonight they were focus on one table and clearly I could see they were being served all the variety of meats.  Not sure if they knew the owner.  Suffice it to say, me and my girlfriend were only served 4 different meats over a 1 and a half hour period.  So I got tired of waiting and left, still hungry.  Also it was bit pricey 89 for the 2 of us plus 8 dollar for bottle beer and 4 dollar for spring water.  Save your money, not worth.   But if u got some extra dough lying around and ypi want to try something new then go for it.  But don't expect too much meat to come your way. The thought I had when I left was \"WHERE THE MEAT\""}
{"text":"Great food, great customer service, amazing atmosphere!!! The best restaurant in Las Vegas if you like meat! Go there and you will not be disappointed ! Also the bar and the deserts are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"trying to call to make an reservation but no one answered the phone. i've called about 10 times?"}
{"text":"Was expecting better the salad bar is mediocre not much to chose from and Everything happens so fast we felt so rushed to leave It was awful Was Expecting so much more!"}
{"text":"This was a great night.  Delicious food, great service, great atmosphere.  I took my university student athlete and roommate for dinner.  These kids can eat, and they were in heaven with all the protein you can eat.  They loved the huge cheesecake as well.  Good for special ocassion, business dinner or just night our when you are hungry.  I'll  be back"}
{"text":"Service was good.  We had a good server who remembered, from my reservation, that one of us was celebrating a birthday.  I was more impressed by the desserts than I was by the meats and salad bar.  The meats were mostly medium well but I always prefer well - no pink. It was hard to get even when I requested it.  The meat just didn't taste extraordinary to me.  Maybe the draw is that you can get it in abundance.  The desserts, even on the tray of fake desserts, looked amazing.  My friend, the birthday celebrant, had the carrot cake which she said was very moist and tasty.  I had the Brazilian Cheesecake which was so good that I would return for that alone."}
{"text":"My family has been going here for years. The quality of the food along with the service makes it worth it every time. You could avoid wait times by simply scheduling a reservation. The staff are very accommodating and the salad bar definitely helps with the huge amounts of meats. The dessert are awesome too. My family will definitely continue to go here and I recommend this place to any tourists seeking a semi- fine dining experience off the strip."}
{"text":"I spent my anniversary here with my boyfriend and my experience was amazing. We had reservations at 1900 and when we met with the hostess she said, \"That we would be seated momentarily\". We literally had to wait for like 4 minutes and they called us to be seated. It was pretty quick! After we were sat down our waitress unfolded our napkins on our lap. Then we had this guy who explained how the whole process works with the green/red card to bring out the meats, the salad/soup bar, etc.   It was our first time eating there and we had a blast. Thank you for making our anniversary a memorable one!"}
{"text":"Absolutely thee most incredible salad bar..  The meats were all equally GREAT.. The filet wrapped in bacon GETS IT... $$$  About 70 a Person.  Excellent wait staff"}
{"text":"Had an Amazing dinner here last night! The service was Outstanding! There was always someone at your table to make sure you were satisfied, whether it be a server, chef or manager, they all wanted to make sure that you were having a Wonderful experience. The food was Awesome and the gauchos were at your table as soon as you flipped your card. We will definitely be back with friends and family!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. The salad bar provided a multitude of choices. Turning card to green.  A parade of gauchos appeared with many varieties of meat. LAMB CHOPS are like butter. Carnivores Heaven!"}
{"text":"I have been visiting here for over 5+ years now and every visit has consistently been a treat.  Here's my summary of all those great visits throughout the years. My last visit was on a Thursday night with a 7:45 reservation dinner for 3.  Service: Amazing how consistent the service has been considering it's always packed at just about every visit. They get you started quickly with the bread, garlic mashed potatoes and fried sweet bananas within 7 minutes of sitting down.  Waters are filled, drink orders are taken and you're off.  You don't have to worry about  Food: Consistently on point!  Salad Bar: The creamy lobster bisque, doesn't actually have lobster in it.  BUT I love it, I start each visit with the bisque and end it with the bisque when I'm full af. Yes, that's weird.  Slabs of goat cheese, jalapenos and asparagus tips is what I throw down with the meats.  It amazes me how everything here is always high quality and fresh.  Meats: The presentation of the waiters bringing around the slabs of meat is always fun to me, like Disneyland.  Some meats have better days than others, but these are my favs. Filet Mignon - Medium rare is the only way I roll. House Sirloin - Usually get this 3 times if they have it. Lamb Chops - Lamb can be messed up quickly if not prepared right, always good here. Pork Ribs - Always juicy, with too much fat sometimes.  Which I actually like, ugh. lol Flank Steak - Seems to always be the first meat on the plate? I don't mind Parmesan Crusted Pork Loin - If not careful, this can come out dry. But so good when it's not!  Value: $49.99 (dinner) for AYCE meat brings me pretty good value imo.  Coupled with the amazing salad bar, totally gets us home.  Ambiance: High quality utensils and plates are utilized as you're cutting meat all day.  Tables, are packed tight but not to hinder travel throughout the restaurant.  It's going to be noisy because it's always packed but still a great place for a date to have conversation.  Classy atmosphere that puts you in a good mood to eat massively =)  Summary: I usually save this place to bring visiting guests who don't have a texas de brazil or haven't experienced this type of dining.  At the same time, it's great place to just get down when you're looking to get your alpha carnivore on."}
{"text":"Great service and food!  Salad bar was amazing and the variety of meats were awesome!"}
{"text":"The place is great.  Food wonderful .   Favio the manager was super nice.  I will definitely be back.  The lobster soup off the chart .   David our server was friendly   Back again on Mother's Day 2018 and it was great.  ANDRE the manager is super nice"}
{"text":"We have been to other Brazilian steakhouses so we know what to expect. The salad bar was smaller than others we have been to. would have like a few more visits by the meat servers. For those reasons I give a 3 star grade...the meat we did get to try was good."}
{"text":"Excellent salad bar, Cory our server was very attentive. The Parmesan crusted chicken was out of this world. Well well worth the money.  Order a bottle of reasonably priced Simi and your loving life."}
{"text":"All I have to say is AMAZING!! From the drinks to the salad bar to the meat it all was so tasty! And the staff was very friendly! I came for my 30th birthday din and couldn't have been more happier! If you sign up online for email offers they usually send $25 off your check every month."}
{"text":"I had heard great things about this place, finally decided to check it out for myself. Once we arrived I was excited to dig and enjoy some  great food, unfortunately my son fell sick and started throwing up before I could eat anything, as a concerned mother my focus was to get my child to urgent care. I told my husband to pay the bill while I took our child to the car, well they still charged for me even though I didn't eat anything. I called back the following week explained the situation and if just for me since I was not able to eat that I could get a voucher for me to come back. the manager said they would have to get back to me because they needed to talk to the waiter, i never received a call back. I then had to call back the next day to be told that the manager i spoke to was gone for the day. I called back again had to explain my story to another manager just to be told that I should have talked to a manager the night every thing happened and the best they could do is give me 20 percent off. Like hellloo my child was sick, did you really expect me to wait for a manager to show up while my child kept throwing. And on top of that when we were seated it took 20 minutes before our waiter came, and that was after someone had to go find him and let him know he had a table. overall it was a bad experience during the dinner and bad customer service addressing my complaint after."}
{"text":"I believe it was $45 per person for dinner. AYCE STEAK!!! Unbelievably delicious. I am in love with this place. ALL MEATS were cooked so perfectly and juicy.  Not a big fan of their chickens though. I came here for red meat anyways.  Your money will only be put to worth if you stuff yourself until you bloat.  BTW: best flan ever. Very thick, very good."}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite meal that Pittsburgh has to offer.  Everything they cook (haven't tried the lamb)  is absolutely amazing.   I typically won't eat flank steak but tried it as recommended by one of my servers and it was ridiculously amazing.  I will say that drinks are a little expensive here,  more so than other high end restaurants downtown but I'm not taking a star away bc I love it here and love this place and would eat here every day if I could."}
{"text":"I was apprehensive to go here, we wanted to go to Fogo De Chao, but they didn't serve lunch on the weekend.    Was pleasantly surprised though.  Very nice, modern decor.  Very friendly service, and quality of food was very good.  Meats may be slightly less flavorful than FDC, but still good.  House special meat really great, very good options at the salad bar.  We also got free dessert which they don't offer at FDC, but think that's only on the weekend.  Way better than the casino buffet scene, definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Pros: Cool atmoshere Great steak & lamb Good service Good side dishes  Cons: pork wasn't that good salad bar is lacking lobster bisque had NO lobster and was bland"}
{"text":"I won a gift card for Texas de Brazil at our company Christmas party, I wasn't too excited about it but my husband was. I was pleasantly surprised. As someone who isn't a huge meat eater I headed to the salad bar and I loved all the options. Everything I tried was delicious! I especially loved the lobster bisque. My big surprise was at how much I enjoyed the meat, so good! Better than other high end steakhouses we've tried. My husband was in Heaven, and by the end I was so full I thought I might die. LOL   Our waiter, Richie was amazing and we will request his section when we return."}
{"text":"I heard people rave about this place.  Finally got a gift card from costco.  Salad bar is a good size, most of food is cold, especially the asparagus.. with a few hot dishes.  Tried not eat too much of salad bar and and get our money worth from the meat.  Lobster bisque was alright, nothing to brag about.  You want lobster bisque go to Joes Stone at Caesars, they make it at your table.  Cheeses and cold cuts were very good, mash potatoes good. The meats:  lucky filet wrapped in bacon was our first try. Filet was good but bacon was all fat.  Lamb and their signature sirloin for both tough and tough to cut / chew.  We stuck with Filet which was very good but all their meats are on salty side.  Other Brazilian places include seafood or shrimps but not here.  Desert is not included either.  Good thing we went for lunch and not dinner prices.  I won't be returning, for $33 I can have a much better steak and frites meal at our favorite restaurant on the strip."}
{"text":"This is the place to go if you have a little extra money in your pocket and an insatiable appetite for meat  All you can eat  pretty much says it all  they have some of the best tasting meat I've ever had as well as a extremely well thought out and laid out buffet to accompany your carnivorous appetite   If you're looking for cheap dining , this is not the place ,  however you do get your moneys worth. Come hungry and wear your sweatpants (just kidding on the sweatpants)"}
{"text":"I only have one thing to say about this place: INCREDIBLE. I don't eat a lot of meat, so I wasn't sure if this would be an experience worth my money, but let me tell you, it was worth every cent. Their meat practically melts in your mouth; it is so tender and juicy. Their salad bar is just as amazing. I was impressed that they had tabbouleh salad as I do not see that at salad bars often. The service was perfect. The waiter never let our drinks get empty, and he checked on us often but not so often that it became annoying. If you love meat, this place is like meat heaven!"}
{"text":"OMG, love this place. We are like regular customers here. If we want to eat lamb chops, this would be the first place in our mind. The meats are always moist and delicious. Their fried bananas are to die for.  I am hungry just thinking about it. Lol"}
{"text":"An outstanding dining experience, started with a unique and massive salad bar where you can choose from a host of over 50 items.  Come back as much and as often as you like.  The salad dressings are spectacular.      This was our first time in.  My wife eats no meat and still Texas de Brazil's salad bar full of  delightful cheeses, shrimp salad, tabbouleh,  lobster bisque, a variety of roasted and grilled vegetables, sushi, smoked salmon and other salad items kept her happy and contented.  Additional sides, like potatoes au gratin, yucca, rice, and sautéed mushrooms are available in, yes you guessed it, an endless supply.  As you return to your table and begin to dine on your salad bar choices, you enjoy not one waiter, but many as the \"Passadors\" who are constantly walking the restaurant with giant skewers of meat brought to your table and carved table side continually ask if you would care for whatever they are carrying.  The endless supply of meats include Parmesan encrusted chicken, pork tenderloin, barbecue ribs, a spicy chicken breast, lamb chops, venison, sausages, plain or bacon wrapped filet mignon, chicken drumsticks and bacon wrapped chicken.   The passadors come often and with delicious varieties of meats, seasoned to perfection and done to whatever temperature you might desire.  The meal includes select drinks and dessert if you have any room left.  Service is fast and impeccable.  The environment is upscale and casual offering very comfortable seating.  We will return often. Texas de Brazil turned out to be a wonderful and delightful surprise and value.  We commend this restaurant to you without reservations."}
{"text":"I've never been to a restaurant as beautiful as this one. From the decor to the food, everything was gorgeous. I didn't have room for all of the soups, salads and meats but everything I had was absolutely delicious. The customer service was tops. I can't wait for my next visit here."}
{"text":"I've read the reviews at 1 and 3 stars.  But, I have to say...we had the best experience. Our service was excellent and the food...AMAZING!  We absolutely loved it!"}
{"text":"First visit but not my last! The food is amazing but our service was TOTALLY awesome! They have great drinks and the salad bar does not underwhelm at all! Jane was our seever and she was the best! They have the largest slice of carrot cake I have ever seen. Kudos!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here tonight and it was our first experience at a Brazilian steakhouse...it didn't disappoint! For some reason we have just never had the desire to go to one of these places when presented with the opportunity in the past. Tonight as we were leaving Trader Joe's we looked to our left and saw this looming restaurant and were curious as to what it was, and then the most amazing smells hit us, so in we went. The salad bar was large and had a good selection. The lobster bisque was delicious, as were the fresh cheeses and prosciutto. As others have mentioned you could easily fill yourself up at the salad bar if you're not careful. The meats were amazing-so juicy and flavorful. We really appreciated that they brought us meat that was cooked more on the rare side like we had asked for. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Out of all the Brazilian steakhouses in Las Vegas (I've dined at all) Texas is the best. I only request medium rare meat, and it's medium rare here.   At the other Brazilian steakhouses, medium rare steak is over cooked.  Salad bar has a nice selection of entrees, traditional side dishes are great and nice selection of drinks.   I like the décor - clean, open and has a nice flow for being consistently busy.   Gauchos are very upbeat, friendly and have a fun vibe. I enjoy chatting with them more than my server at times, lol.   Dine here often, keep up the fun vibe ~"}
{"text":"This place is amazing and totally worth the price! The meat selection is ridiculous mad everything is cocked different ways so no matter how you like your meat cooked- they have it! Be carful of the salad bar though because that too has a yummy selection and it's very easy to get full off that before you dive into the meats. Either way, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Went last night and it was awesome. Adam was our server and he didn't disappoint. Very prompt and courteous and very funny. Great personality. Took a little bit for the meat to start coming around but once it did, it didn't stop."}
{"text":"Not impressed, 40 minute wait for our table even with a reservation.  Certainly understaffed.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Insanely over priced salty meat that made me beyond sick. I've never been so ill from a meal in my life. It was $64 for buffet, dinner, one glass of wine and tip. No thanks."}
{"text":"I have been to several Rodizios over the years and this has by far been the best! To start off the flavors were excellent with the meats having that unique Brazilian taste. The thing that really set this apart was the variety of meats being brought around. Just when u thought the selection was done something else would come around. To top out the experience, the staff were beyond attentive, my water glass never below 50%, the waiter constantly checking to see if we needed anything, and The promptness with which a request was fulfilled was delightful."}
{"text":"First 2 times we visited the service and food were 1st class....each time after that( about 3 more times) the service got worse each time. This is always on a Sunday. The food was slow to come to the table. Many times left with nothing on our plates for long periods!  We finally decided not to ever go back. Too much money for such poor service. Potential is there.... food is good... when you can get it"}
{"text":"Location: Nestled in Station Square beside Sheraton. Great spot for catching the Gateway Clipper/Segway/Ducky Tours  Facility: Friendly Hostess and asked if we had dined here before to which we answered no. We were seated with a smile.  Explained the salad bar and meat options to us. You serve yourself at the salad bar and the options are plentiful if you don't eat meat. Then gauchos (Brazil Cowboys) come around with large meat cuts cooked at medium rare on skewers to cut off and serve as much as you like.  They also have a large bar area with good bottle selection. The facility is large and could easily accommodate a huge party at a moments notice with everyone starting to eat in under 5min.  My Experience: Stephanie walked us through the menu and cocktail list. Our server Rich was top notch, funny, professional and on point. Last, Slade (I believe) stopped by and shared his experience and growth inside of the restaurant giving it a family feel counter to most corporate restaurants.  In Conclusion: A must do for a large party or a very hungry couple that may be on a time constraint and wants a quick wholesome meal and excellent service from the whole team."}
{"text":"Been here twice.  Second time with a group of girls.  A waiter broke my friend's camera by accident, the manager did not waive her bill, nor did he provide free dessert.  My friend tried to use a $10 off coupon that was emailed to her, the manager told her: \"this coupon is not good for Saturdays.\"  my friend said: \"for what happened tonight, you should at least honor my coupon.\"  It wasn't like my friend was asking for free stuff.  I could hear the manager snap at her: \"Do you want me to pay for your camera or not?\"  He made it sound like if my friend got reimbursed for her camera, she did not deserve to use the coupon.  For a high end restaurant like that, the manager's conduct was totally unprofessional and we will never go back there anymore unless a new manager is in place.   The waiter was very apologetic and was very nice.    My friend dealt with the corporate directly and got her broken camera reimbursed.  The manager has not apologized for what he said nor had he contacted her after.  Personally I don't have anything against this restaurant, the food was good, service was good, but will not go back there because of this manager."}
{"text":"I have taken friends there for special occasions and this place never ceases to amaze me.  Great service and great quality of meats.  Highly recommended to make a reservation."}
{"text":"Great service! Variety of different steaks, chicken, lamb chops, sausage and a buffet of sides. The taste and season one are the best. Come on an empty stomach and be prepared to eat all you can because it is very filling. Love this place and I always come him occasionally."}
{"text":"I took my mom here for her birthday and the food was absolutely phenomenal. Upon arriving I made a reservation and was sat immediately. We were then explained by our sever how everything worked and asked if we had any questions or requests to not hesitate on asking. We started with the salad bar where they offered wide variety of salads, cheeses, sushi rolls and salmon. After we finished with what we picked out from the salad bar we tried many of the different meats they offered and my favorite was the prime rib. We finished our meal with a flan my mothers favorite dessert. Overall the staff was friendly and the atmosphere is very clean and upscale I would recommend for any special occasion."}
{"text":"My first time at Texas de Brazil and I must say that I was impressed. I have been to 3 different Brazilian steakhouses and this one is the second best. Beautiful ambiance, ample seating, lovely decor. The seating is a bit close together. Doesn't make it too comfy for a 7 month pregnant woman :) On this particular day, service was slow. Our waiter was very kind and checked on us, but he was slow in bringing drinks and we had to ask for any refills that we wanted. The salad bars was one of the nicest that I've seen compared to the other Brazilian steakhouses that I've been to. Great selection. I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Took my fiance here for his birthday. The restaurant closes after lunch, and reopens at 5PM for dinner.  I would highly recommend reservations as this place gets really busy.  It is comparable to the more known Fogo de Chao... but better!    The atmosphere is elegant and welcoming.  Dinner is $49.99 per person which includes all the meat you can eat, plus the salad bar.  The salad bar had scalloped potatoes, black beans, lobster bisque, salad items, fruits, cheese and salami/prosciutto, veggies just to name a few.  My eyes were so wide with the variety that I filled my plate with the salad bar.    You are given a 2 sided mini coaster.  The red side means you do not want servers offering you food.  Green is go... and boy do they come.  High quality meats on large skewers are offered to you... They even ask if you have a meat temp preference.  Some meats were the sausage, parmesean chicken, bacon wrapped chicken, filet mignon, leg of lamb, and soo many others.  We tried a bit of most.  My fav was the sausage and chicken.    Service was extremely quick during the first half hour, then slowed down a bit towards the end.  We would definitely come back.  This place comes highly recommended."}
{"text":"Best restaurant ever! My mind was completely blown! There was a really diverse salad bar with every kind of vegetable you can imagine. The quality of the meats were really great. There was even bacon-covered chicken! The waiters and waitresses were really fancy too. Definitely worth it if you're willing to go!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this restaurant and i will tell you, it was even better than how people described. The best $50 ever spent. The salad bar was phenomenal. From smoked salmon, to shrimp, to cucumber salad...it was great. Bottomless salad bar with endless meat coming to your table. My favorite was the steak...the Brazilian touch makes it taste amazing. Service was excellent..very attentive server."}
{"text":"The food here was delicious and especially considering we came at lunch! Variety at the salad bar was nice and variety of meats was even better than described on their website, so was a definite plus! Shout out to Vance for the great service and to all the gauchos! We will visit for dinner the next time we are in town to try their lobster bisque as this menu item is not available during lunch."}
{"text":"This place is almost impossible to beat.  Laid out slightly different than other locations yet somehow familiar, the salad bar displays the usuals and is very briefly visited by me as I know the routine already; meat, meat, and more meat.  All of the meat was cooked to perfection as always; as I said, almost impossible to beat.  The service was excellent especially as some staff stayed late since our group didn't get there until 9~PM, an hour before they closed (due to our tradeshow). They were patient and kind, especially with a group of unruly drunkards, just what the doctor ordered after a terribly long day.  It further solidifies that I would never hesitate to visit any one of these establishments."}
{"text":"On a whim, Mom and I made a reservation here. This spot is on OpenTable and we had no issues grabbing a Friday night reservation.  Let me break down the mystery that is Texas De Brazil: + It's a flat rate of $48/per person. This includes a salad bar with all the fixings, a buffet with everything from charcuterie to couscous and sushi, and carvings from up to 14+ types of meat. This does not include drinks or desserts.  + The clientele was dressed suppperrr casual inside (I was shocked), despite the price point. So, you don't need to dress up fancy.   + They give you a little card to place on the corner of your table. If the green side is up, than a carver will stop at your table with a meat. In seconds, literally 3-4 carvers will be at your table with a different meat. Our favorites were the Picahna, Alcatra and the Flank Steak. With nearly 14 different types, I honestly don't even think we made it through half. But, all the meats we did try were excellent. Perfect seasoning, great flavor, and needed no sauces or salt and pepper. If the red side is up on the card, they will not stop at your table.  + Our server Todd was super knowledgable, very cordial and extremely fast. He was consistently stopping by to see if he could send a certain carver to our table. The entire staff, from the servers to the carvers, work very hard and are well-organized.  Overall, we had a nice meal. The food was quite heavier than we expected, so definitely go on an empty stomach. If you love trying different meats, you will love it here. If you're a vegetarian, I imagine this is your hell. In the future, I'm not sure when I'll ever be like, \"Hey, I'm craving 14 different types of meats tonight,\" but the experience of a Brazilian steakhouse is worth trying at least once!"}
{"text":"This was my second time here and again it was excellent!! We were in Las Vegas for a week and had planned on going on Veteran's day but 2 days before I get an email saying that they will run the 50% off special the entire week! Not only that but they will give 50% the entire table up to 8 guest not only the Veteran. I was super excited as my friend was in town that night and would not be here on Veteran's day. We changed our plans and took our friend. We all really enjoyed ourselves. My husbands favorite was the leg of lamb and my favorite was the house special. Cindy really enjoyed the lobster bisque. Can't wait to go back. Really wish we had a Texas de Brazil in Hawaii."}
{"text":"Having the good fortune of experincing Gaucho Style Churrascaria eating in the countries where it originated, Brasil and Argentina (in the region known as the Pampas), I tend to be a little more critical than those reviewers new to this style of dining.   First, let me say the attitude and the service of the staff is very good, and would merit 4 stars. The server was constantly checking on the table and made sure that all would be enjoying the meats of their choice, prepared as requested. But there is more to it than great service when judging a Brasilian Style churrascaria.  Sad to say that more isn't always better. I found the meat to be inferior in quality, portion, and preparation. Since a Churrascaria is \"all you can eat\", expect to find very average buffet quality meats. Don't expect you are going to enjoy the same quality of Steak Place, such as Morton's, The Palm, or Del Frisco's.   Think of the experience at Texas de Brasil, as dining at \"rich man's\" Golden Corral.   I give the food 2 Stars. Therefore, 4 star service and 2 star food, average out to be a 3, and considering dinner is about $50 per person, that 3 is a generous rating."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and the food was amazing. A bit on the pricey side but totally worth it. Customer service was amazing."}
{"text":"It's my favorite restaurant hands down. The service is always great. The salad bar is always fresh and fully stocked. Everything is cooked to perfection and I do enjoy the drinks as well. We come there for almost every special occasion in our family!"}
{"text":"A local favorite and must experience for visitors. Maybe the best overall dining experience in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"First time coming to this steakhouse and I must say that it is very different. Price was reasonable for the amount of food you can eat. It's like a buffet that caters to you. But with different types of meat. I had an excellent time, was definitely pleased. All the meats were hot and juicy, the mashed potatoes are the best!! Desert was delicious and the cocktails are great. But best of all the service is what makes them a five star review. I will definitely be back and rave to friends and family :)"}
{"text":"The variety and flavors of the Brazilian cuisine were outstanding and authentic.  This may be the best Brazilian steakhouse in Ohio and certainly in NE Ohio.  Service was timely and often and the atmosphere was clean and lively."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The meat is delicious and perfectly seasoned. The salad bar is huge and the sides are good, too. Try to save room for dessert because it is worth it! I had the Bellini and it was very good as well. The decor is beautiful. The only bad thing was one of the guys dropped a cut of steak on my pants as he was putting it on my plate and he didn't really seem to care. It ended up staining those pants. The food is worth it and we will return!"}
{"text":"5 stars all the way....theres no menu.  Salad bar is NOT your average salad bar. Sushi rolls.  Green beans almondine. Asparagus. Meats and cheeses, hard and soft. Jalapeno peppers grilled with red onion and olive oil.  Gosh, I cant even remember the entire salad bar.  I was stuffed on goodies for sure.  At each persons place setting is a small card. One side is red, other side is green.  Leave it on red while you enjoy your salad bar. Soup on my visit was lobster bisque. When you're finished and are ready to eat the main course simply turn your card over to green. Now the fun begins. Servers come around and carve meat onto your plate. Use your personal tongs to grab the meat as its shaved off. We had LEG OF LAMB (melted in my mouth but not closer to the center) LAMB CHOPS (waaaay too salty) SAUSAGES. BBQ RIBS. BEEF TENDERLOIN?  BEEF TIP?  CHICKEN BREAST.  PARMESAN CHICKEN.  The variety of meats just kep surprising me!  When I thought I was done I would see a NEW meat going around!  Server was REAL GOOD about bringing me a new plate whenever I saw something I wanted to try. The meats just kept coming!   The slices are very small. Dont fret.  You WILL get the meat!!  Hahaha. I also tried their daily special, costs extra (no idea the cost), which was bacon wrapped jalapeno peppers with cream cheese.  Hot and good. Several desserts to choose from. Choose just one.  Choc cake. Banana coconut pie.  Creme brulee...  Uh....cant recall the rest..anyway 3 people.  3 beers and 3 cocktails.  Bill was $231.  Add tip nearly $300.  Worth it.   But not every day.  Hahahaa.   I couldn't understand a word my server was saying but I am sure he said I was beautiful or something like that.....whatever he said it was music."}
{"text":"We were wandering Station Square and thankfully my boyfriend got excited over Brazilian steak. We were seated immediately at a quiet table in the corner overlooking the restaurant so we had a great view of everyone and could see where all the meats were at! Our waiter Raymond was on point!! He totally made out visit! The meats were cooked to a medium rare perfection. The lamb was out of this world with their mint jelly. Raymond made us a topping of rice, beans and Brazilian vingerette which again was quite tasty! The salad bar options ranged from traditional Brazilian to Japanese to American. Totally something eh for everyone. We passed on the desserts because none of them were too appealing after such an amazing dinner."}
{"text":"AMAZING restaurant!! This place has the best salad bar that I have ever had. Pricey, but totally worth it! And extremely friendly and knowledgeable staff! This is a must try!!"}
{"text":"I love Brazilian steakhouses. The meat is excellent and always well seasoned(naturally). Drinks are good. People good.  Kind of loud in the dinning room tho."}
{"text":"Disappointing that they don't take phone reservations anymore. They say their service isn't working and it hasn't been for awhile. They really don't care. Had dinner there tonight. Food was good as usual, service was off. Seemed like server had too many tables all over the building. Managers could care less about phone problems or customers."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience!!!  Every single item on the menu is out of this world good! The service was friendly and fast. The salad bar was surprisingly amazing as well!  I can't wait to come back with more friends and family."}
{"text":"Everything about my experience at Texas de Brazil was awesome. Their restaurant is really well laid out an acoustically very nice. The one thing I would say is that if you're going to go for dinner make sure you go on an empty stomach because there are no doggie bags although you will want to take some food home with you.   From the filet mignon wrapped in bacon to the top sirloin or the chicken wrapped in bacon - all of the meats were incredible and totally worth going for the. The salad bar was excellent as well I got a lot of olives with the mini corns - those are too funny.   Carlos was our server and he made sure that we always had a clean plate or our drinks were topped off. The entire experience was 5 stars and if I wanted to eat that much every day or spend $50 a meal... this would be the spot!"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant on the evening of 3/26. Upon entering the hostest was fantastic,kept up conversation and seated us quickly. The food and the gauchos really were the only thing that ended up making the experience anything near worth the prices paid for the dinner. It is expensive to say the least and for my money I expected far better service. Our waitress was seemed to be the human equivalent of Eeyore. She seemed completely uninterested in her job and us for that matter. Our drinks we're never full throughout the experience. Also for it being out first time there you would think she would have checked to make sure we we're having a good time and understanding everything going on properly, but no. She would go into the back where I can only assume she was sucked into a gravitational singularity that only she was effected by. When she finally resurfaced after we had been finished for a good fifteen minutes she offered us desert which I was happy to hear about, Went away to get the tray, which tool another ten minutes, when she returned she slammed the tray onto the table and my boyfriends cell phone scratching the screen and not even attempting to apologize. After making my decision upon desert she did the only thing she did with any speed throughout the entire night which was rush us out of the table. I assure you her tip reflected her service and even though I live very close to this location, I assure you myself and my family will make the drive to their other Ohio location. Sadly what could have been a fantastic experience was absolutely horrid due to terrible service. I would have let the manager know except for the fact he only stopped by our table once at the beginning when I wasn't even at the table. I will not return to this location due to service, but look forward to trying their other location. The food overall was truly deciduous and my drink was fantastic, so at least there was that."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my top picks in this area of the country. I have dealt on several occasions with members of management, serving, wait, and prep. Obviously staff members deal more with different areas of the restaurant. Prep for deals more with the salad bar area if you can call it that. It is a huge area well over 40 items always kept full and fresh. Dressings, cheese, meat, even pepperoncini.  Its really a meal on its own. The meats good come next are almost undescribable. Everything and anything you've ever heard of, seen, looked at in a picture, is there. All brought directly to you're plate buy dedicated staff. Desserts always at least seven or eight choices at the top of the scale. Don't worry about the price when you go I guarantee you will eat three times the food you've ever eaten any other restaurant and they will ask if you want more."}
{"text":"My first time checking out this restaurant was last Saturday.  I had heard so many raving about this restaurant...  and they were all correct!  We knew when we walked in and saw so many people in the restaurant that it was going to be a hit!  The salad bar is absolutely wonderful...  I would return again just for that!  The protein selections are incredible.  I highly suggest trying the Pork Tenderloin...  definitely a favorite!  The staff was so helpful and pleasant.  Our check ended up being around $100 per person - with the dinner plus a few drinks for each of us.  Looking forward to returning in the near future!"}
{"text":"If you like beef, this is you spot.  Service was exceptional as was all the meats they brought to our table.  Plus they have a wonderful and unusual salad bar.  Everything is  star"}
{"text":"Amazing food!! This is a treat to your taste buds for sure. If you are in vegas you owe it to yourself to visit this place, be sure to come hungry because they truly don't stop bringing the flavor until you ask them to stop. A cut above in freshness and variety to satisfy anyone. Deserts are on par as well all around flavor explosion defiantly would recomend. I would suggest reservations as you can make them online as this place stays quite busy"}
{"text":"Another beautiful evening   with my lovely Wifey in a wonderful  place:   Texsas de Brazil.  I very much recommend to everyone who wants enjoyed delicious selection of meet and vine."}
{"text":"Holy crap. It's so good make sure you come here on an empty stomach. There is sooooo much food and the fried bananas are so amazing."}
{"text":"The meats and the cold food station are absolutely delicious. As a Brazilian-American, I am very picky and discerning about churrascarias. There is a large variety and selection of meats and they are more than accommodating in cooking the meat as per ones preference. The flavors and tenderness are delectable. The service is excellent-- from your server to all the gaúchos (meat carvers), they are attentive, helpful, friendly, efficient and professional.  I very highly recommended this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's birthday, also our first time, I absolutely love this place, yes it was a little pricey but it was worth every penny, the food was amazing, and so was the service. Will be coming back here again."}
{"text":"We absolutely LOVED this restaurant! The ambiance is great, everyone was friendly and the food was AMAZING! Best salad bar ever. Our server David was fantastic, extremely knowledgeable and didn't rush is even though we said we we're full. We definitely recommend it. For meat lovers. BRING YOUR APPETITE!"}
{"text":"This is my go to spot when my steak cravings flare up. I love steakhouses, but sometimes a craving needs to be satisfied with excessive amounts of red meat.   My first tip is to eat here for lunch or brunch on a weekend. It's cheaper than dinner and having been here for dinner I can't find a difference in the foods offered.   The salad bar is good enough to make a meal. That is coming from a meat fan. The salad bar has much more than the average salad bar. It includes smoked salmon, assorted cheeses, several veggie salads, fruit salads, lobster bisque, and sushi. I also find it hard to resist filling up on just the salad bar.   Before the meal the server will bring out plantains, mashed potatoes, and cheddar biscuits. All of the above are delicious and yet another temptation I have to resist before the meat arrives. The plantains are my favorite!   The first time I came here I thought that the meat would be abundant, but mediocre quality. I was completely wrong. The meats are actually delicious and well seasoned. The variety should please all tastes too. They offer parmesan chicken, several cuts of steak, lamb, and sausage. The steaks are my favorite meats.   The service is very attentive. Someone is always at the table offering meat or refilling drinks. The servers are always really good about getting certain meats to the table if you have a preference. On one visit my husband ordered a cocktail that he didn't care for, nothing was wrong with the drink. Our waitress noticed he didn't drink it and insisted on taking the drink off of the bill. We never expected this or asked her to do this, but that to me is great service.  MEAT!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night.  The beef and the lamb were what I ate so I can't comment on the rest.  They were good. Some better then others. Next time I will get more of others.  I'd skip the mint sauce as it was a bit too sweet and fake tasting.  The salad bar was good. I loved the peppers and prosciutto.   The green pea dish was great.  I also liked the spicy peppers but careful they are very hot.  Definitely try the lobster bisque so smooth and velvety. I didn't eat anything else off the hot bar but the mashed potatoes on the table were also very smooth.  The food is 4 star but the reason for my 3 was my table. They wedged me in a table right at the front 5 feet from checkin it was like dining in the lobby and it was pretty rude.  I'm not sure I will go back if that is how they're going to treat guests that aren't the large parties they seem to cater to."}
{"text":"I had no idea what I was missing out on my whole life... This place is the best!. I am not really a meat eater so I was unsure about going to such a place but let me tell you even if you don't care for red meat they have so many options. The salad bar has enough delicious food to fill you up by itself and then those cheese bread things omg are soooo good. I t is pricey but worth EVERY penny! The service is really good too! I am looking for an excuse to go back already!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Nice atmosphere and waitress was very nice and attentive. Salad bar amazing, White Russians are the best ever! Kind of pricey but nice date night place to go. Truly a unique dining experience and worth the money!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. My husband takes me there for our anniversary every year and they treat us so well. The food is good at the salad bar. The meat you can just ask for what you want and they will come around with the what you want the way you want it. I recommend this restaurant. It is a little bit pricey, but since we only go once a year, it is okay."}
{"text":"We've been to Fogo de Chao and wanted to try a different place, so we came here for our first dinner in Vegas. This place was outstanding. Service was impeccable, and from the minute we sat down, meat was coming at us. All of it was a perfect medium rate, all of it perfectly seasoned. I love at these types of places how the servers learn to know what you like and what you don't, so that's what they bring around for you.   We didn't try the salad bar because, well, why would we? . I'm there for MEAT!!!!  We did, however, leave room for dessert. We selected a beautiful citrus vanilla Creme brûlée. Oh my...it was heaven. Definitely will visit again. We will at least try the one that's about 1 1/2 hours from our home.   Excellent. Come hungry and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Freaking awesome. Great sides, loved the bar. The shrimp was very undervalued. As far as the meats, I would have to go with the top sirloin, great taste!!! Also the bacon wrapped chicken was pretty tasty as well.  It was a little odd that they didn't have fountain coke. But what do I know I don't own a multi million dollar restaurant. Can't wait till our one opens in Lexington!!!"}
{"text":"This is my second time coming here and I've been satisfied both times! The full dinner price is around $50 +tax and I think it's cheap for the unlimited meat you get!! The service is great except for the hostess... she couldn't smile not once. I asked her a simple question and she was a little rude. And I guess she tried to \"make up\" for it when she told me one dish had lobster (which is the soup). Also, she briefly explained the cocktail menu and asked if we have been here before. We said yes. Then she asked my boyfriend if he needed an explanation of the menu. He said no because we know how it works and she goes, \"Well Im going to explain it anyway.\" Excuse you??? And I thought maybe she wasn't having it at the time she sat us, but she sat a party behind us and even gave them attitude. Hostess is an important job. You are the first face of the restaurant and that means first impression. I would seriously give this place 3 stars because of her!! I am BIG on customer service. If the service is trash, I wouldn't come back no matter how great the food is. BUT! Our server Jay (his name was more difficult and he told us to call him Jay) was SOOOO nice and kind. He was attentive and I liked that. He smiled the whole time he was explaining things to us. He was just amazing really. He will make this experience great!  The salad bar has variety of different veggies and side dishes to choose from. There's even rice and soup off to the side of the bar. I haven't tried the soup but their salami and grape salad is great! The cheese is rich in flavor and overall a good taste. But save room for the meat that goes around! It's kind of entertaining to watch these people walk around with the huge stick with meat on it! They offer meats such as: lamb, different steaks, & chicken. And the size portions aren't too large so you can try different things! Pretty decent place & i would definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"I took my fiancé here for her birthday and we both loved it.  It is a bit expensive but you won't be disappointed. They have a salad bar with sides were you can eat that doesn't include meat. They have people bring around meat on skewers and cut the meat right onto your plate. They have a plenty of different cuts of meat to choose from and again, you won't be disappointed. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Words of advice, don't pile up on the salad bar thinking you need to get your monies worth or else you'll regret the reason you're there for, the ALL YOU CAN EAT STEAKS!Even at $50 a pop per head, this place just rocks with the cool ambience and Brazilian theme music playing. You have to request the House Picana (Sirloin) and Beef Rib served on a silver platter for sure and often. Everything on the menu for me is tasty and prepared to your likings (rare to well done), and don't be afraid to let the waiters know, and your meal and experience will be well worth the price! The desserts especially the chocolate layer mouse cake is very good also. Make sure you take the time to make a reservation because this place will get packed really fast! I recommend this restaurant if you like meat, and lots of it because it keeps coming, and coming etc."}
{"text":"AMAIZING FOOD! Went there for Easter with my extremely picky family.  There was something for everyone!   The salad area was remarkably fresh and had everything from cheeses, soups, sushi, eggs, breads, vegetables, salads, seafood...I could go on and on...  However the meats were the best part!  After I tried an array of things from the salad area, a troop of meat carvers came around with steak, chicken, pork, and lamb!  The meats were perfectly seasoned. I don't usually eat lamb but the lamb chops were too good to pass up!   I managed to save room for dessert and tried the bananas foster.  It was like banana pudding on crack! It was soo good.  I will defiantly be returning soon!!!"}
{"text":"It's ok. I'm torn because the service was very good. But all of the meat, even after we asked for medium rare... was at least medium. Usually well done. And oh so salty. Yikes. I wouldn't tell people to come here."}
{"text":"Two of us dined there Friday night. First time and probably the last. I was underwhelmed with the salad bar. For $9.99 it probably would have been ok, but for $24.99 I expected a whole lot more. Drinks were expensive and not a good pour. We only had one order of meat along with both of us having the salad bar. The meat wears ok, but I almost fell off my chair when the bill arrived.$177 for the two of us. We had 2 drinks each. Outrageous and certainly not worth it. I'll take my $177 and go to any of the 3 high end steak houses on Chagrin and get better drinks and better food."}
{"text":"I will give 5 stars: good location, nice and gentle stuff.  Enough room inside. Have been here with my family, everyone happy. Expensive but it worth it. Don't eat potato or rise, because you will not have space to try all tipes of cooked meat:). Been here first time and will happy to come again.  Ps: enjoy your meat"}
{"text":"I always have a great experience here at Texas De Brazil. The atmosphere is welcoming and the servers and staff are always so welcoming. Every meat is delicious and their salad bar has an ample amount to pick from. Must try the lobster bisque ! Our server, Marina, was amazing. She was so sweet and very attentive !"}
{"text":"Terrible service, worst manager I've ever experience,.  This is the first negative review I've bothered to write on the net, several positive. Very expensive Ponderosa, if I could give it negative stars I would."}
{"text":"My husband is a big fan of the churrascaria style restaurant, so had been chomping at the bit to try out Texas de Brazil. We went to celebrate his birthday on 5/7. Overall our experience was a very good one.   We used open table to make reservations, and were seated promptly after arriving. Our server was knowledgeable and very helpful. She anticipated our needs before we had them. The food was really great! My husband loved the variety of different meats, and felt they were cooked to perfection, seasoned well and very tender. I enjoyed the salad bar, which is way more than a salad bar. There were over 50 items, many of them hot items and oh, so tasty! Items of note were lobster bisque, potatoes au gratin and feijoada. Our server brought Garlic Mashed Potatoes, Sweet Fried Bananas and Brazilian Cheese Bread to the table. We splurged on desserts (Brazilian cheesecake & chocolate mousse cake), and also enjoyed trying the brazilians beers and cocktails. My fave was the vodka version of \"The Caipirinha\"! Pure awesomeness, very fresh and fruity!   The atmosphere was great -- bright colors, zippy music and gorgeous flowers. We'll be back, for sure, but only for a special treat because it is a LOT of food."}
{"text":"I want to start with the customer service. A+++ I don't know why every time I go up there the Steph curry looking guy is there but he represents exactly how ur supposed to do customer service. Like this guy should teach a class. Then the food.... don't come here if ur not hungry. There is just no reason not to try everything twice. And if u can 3 times. I didn't get the whole fried banana thing but whatever everything else was amazing. I got a VIP card. I'm going back soon"}
{"text":"Reservations were easy to make online. They sat us exactly on time with our reservation. The service of the men serving the meat was on the ball all night. They were friendly and accommodating on preferred temperature of meat. At one point there were four of them at our table. The food was delicious and I was not disappointed at all.  Our waitress on the other hand was pretty slow and seemed overwhelmed all night. Someone in our party ordered a beer and it took over 20 minutes- which seems outrageous considering it was just a bottled beer. She also made a couple weird comments about our ages and ordering drinks... we were all over 21 I.D. us or stop asking questions. At one point I even told her to check our I.D.'s we had no problem showing them to her. Not sure what the issue was, but it was uncomfortable. When she gave us comment cards to fill out she even made a comment that we could mention how much she sucks... apparently she knew it was terrible.   For the price I guess you expect better service and it would make me hesitant to try this one again."}
{"text":"You have to try this place out!! The best quality meats you can only imagine, you will not regrets coming over here, the lamb is the best lamb I've ever had, the service is good, they come around consistently with the different meats to offer, I would say the only down side would be that they don't have free refills. But the water is of great quality too."}
{"text":"I'm a carnivore.  Meat is the staple to my diet.  Please note that I only ate the rodizo array of meat.  The service was good, sangria delicious and the lamb dishes were prepared the best.  Some of the dishes were either too salty or bland.  Compared to my experience with the Texas De Brazil in Nevada, I'm not impressed, hence the \"A-Ok\" review.  If you are a big meat eater and carnivore like me, I'd give this is shot for you will have your chicken, lamb, beef and pork.  If you are not a big meat eater, I'd opt for a different establishment with more variety."}
{"text":"My favorite Brazilian steakhouse in Vegas. Salad bar and hot food items are just as good as the churascarria. My favorite cuts are the garlic sirloin, picanha, and tri-tip. Servers also offer medium rare cuts which I prefer over medium. My past 3 trips to Vegas have involved coming here for dinner and it never gets old or repetitive for me."}
{"text":"1st time and at 6 o'clock it was very busy but it wasn't a long wait, our server was very helpful the salad bar was really good the lobster bisque was good the meats were also good the banana foster pie the key lime pie were good.if you're ready to eat lots of good food this is the spot"}
{"text":"A terrible experience!  We have been there many times to celebrate friends birthdays ( usually 3 times a year with a party of 10 to 12 guests....but this night everything was off. Four times they did not have our wine selection.One of the glasses had some strange cystalization of sugar or something at the bottom of two of our glasses...then when they found a bottle they could serve us we couldn't even taste it before buying it.We didn't even get our first glass untill half way through our dinner. The rounds of meats were not coming to our table except the chicken that came 5 times.. and we kept having to ask for our waters to be refilled. I don't think we will be returning....."}
{"text":"As a Brasa frequenter/enthusiast, we tried this place out bc of the convenient location on a Sunday night. The salad bar is great, love the soup and sushi. The main courses of meats were well done despite the waiter telling us the meats would all be medium rare.  In comparison to Brasa, the meats are underwhelming in taste and variety. The meats come out a slow flow as opposed to the Brasa blitzkrieg.  The servers must've sensed our disappointment and the manager came over and clarified that the meats would be made to our liking, which they eventually were.  Only problem is I was full by that time. Nice effort, but Brasa is still king for me."}
{"text":"Been here several times. Service is hit or miss. They have a decent but not great salad bar. I have also been here when they ran out of items and didnt replace them. They need a caesar salad. The lobster bisque soup is good. I also lije the smoked salmon a lot. They will bring you a ton of meats from pork to steak to chicken to sausage to my favorite lamb chops. If the temperature is not to you choosing ask. They will try to accomodate. I never have room for dessert. Price is about $45."}
{"text":"This is the first time I have been here for Sunday brunch the only difference from dinner is that you get a dessert and non alcoholic drinks come with your meal. My friend had a VIP card so unfortunately she didn't qualify for the freebies since she would be getting a discount with her card. The salad bar is packed with tasty sides to go with your meal. My favorites are the grilled pineapple , shrimp, quinoa, potato salad, tabbouleh, lobster bisque, and marinated mushrooms. I'll usually pair the pineapple with the shrimp so I can get the sweet and savory taste. They also place these fresh tiny pieces of bread that taste like cheez its on the table. If you have never been to a Brazilian barbecue it is equal to a meat bonanza! (All you can eat) There are little place cards on the table when you want meat brought to the table flip the green side up when you have to much to handle flip it back to red. They come around with chicken wrapped in bacon, sausage, filet mignon, garlic flavored steak, flank steak etc. I was so full I didn't care if we missed out on the free dessert! It's a great place to go if you want a new dining experience and are tired of paying $25.00 for itty bitty pieces of steak!"}
{"text":"I LOVEEE STEAK AND LOVEEE THIS PLACE ... All you can eat great service !!! I def recommend this restaurant to all my friends and fam."}
{"text":"The service was excellent! The food was delicious! The salad bar was clean and inviting. We will certainly return for another special occasion meal."}
{"text":"One would think that for what you pay per person to enjoy a meal here, EVERYTHING would be top notch. It was just meh. I took my husband here for his birthday. He had the Dinner and I had the Salad Only. The salad bar has a wide variety of offerings including different cheeses, olives, salami, prosciutto, cold salmon, sushi, shrimp, and a hot station with soup, rice, potatoes, and more. The Dinner includes this plus all you can eat meats that are served table side by meat carvers. Salad bar was very good. I tried a few of my husband's meat selections and they were either over-seasoned, too salty or just not great. The wine by the glass was way overpriced and $9 for a slice of chocolate mouse cake was ridiculous, even for an upscale brazilian steakhouse. My husband expressed a similar opinion over the meats. We will stick with Brasa."}
{"text":"Great! Please talk to hostess as she gave me the lowdown. Good potato salad with the fresh asparagus with the excellent meats was all I needed, great service"}
{"text":"Came here for Friday night dinner, requested a private room for 9 people. Excellent food and service!"}
{"text":"Amazing! And worth it for the weekend it's about $40 per person but includes the desert and delicious salad bar. Staff is friendly and the area is industrial looking and pretty. Key lime pie was amazing"}
{"text":"I have been to one other Brazilian steak house and they are both great. Texas de Brazil has a bigger and better salad bar the service was awesome and the meats were delicious.   My only complaint is that I didn't get to try everything and it seemed that even with my card green if they saw a full plate they would just skip me and my husband. Weird. Still really yummy and we will for sure he coming back"}
{"text":"My company recently had our annual holiday party here with about 60 people total. We were placed in a side room which was nice and mostly a private space. The major downside of being a large party was sub par service we received.   While some of the room had exceptional service throughout the night. My experience was far from it. Every drink I ordered took about 15 mins to come out and I had to ask to for my water to be refilled. We also didn't get to have nearly as many meats come around nor did anyone explain to us that we could request specific cuts to come around. There also was supposed to be strict drink ordering options of wine, beer or wells, but other tables were offered anything they wanted. At least keep it uniform across the whole room.   As for the food I was only able to dine at the salad bar being a pescatarian, but there were quite a few decent options. I enjoyed the Cesar salad, smoked salmon, goat cheese and the roasted mushrooms.   Overall I thought this place was just alright. I don't think I'd come back to spend my own money, especially with the level of service."}
{"text":"This place was great! I'm not much for meat but the meat here was tender and tasteful. Their salad bar had a great variety of side to accompany your meats. I would definitely come back here. The place was pretty busy for a Monday night. The lighting was decent and focused on the food. This place is very pricey though. If you like soda, they charge per bottle. Service was ok. Drinks from the bar were ok."}
{"text":"Great dinner!! Excellent service! Food was perfect and the deserts were amazing.. as for Micah... great server!"}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate our one year engagement anniversary and even though it was a little pricey it was worth every penny!  Since it was a Monday there wasn't much of a wait.  By the time I returned from using the restroom our table was ready.  I didn't particularly like the seating as it was right behind the host station but for being seated that quickly (and being very hungry) I let it slide.  Next time I'll ask for a seat in the back. The only real negative I have us that the entry/exit doors are extremely heavy.  If that's the worst thing about a place in my book that's easily 5 stars.    We started out with the salad bar and a few of my favorite things were the goat cheese,  green beans and au gratin potatoes.  I also really enjoyed the potato salad which is not something I'm usually fond of.    The meats!  Oh the meats!  I tried chicken wrapped in bacon,  chicken parmesian, filet wrapped in bacon,  sirloin steak,  flank steak and sausage.  Everything was delicious.  The sausage has a slight kick to it which was a nice change of pace. The filet wrapped in bacon was a little on the salty side but that didn't stop me from finishing it.  The flank steak and sirloin steak were melt in your mouth delicious.  The chicken options were good but I'm more of a red meat person so they don't really stand out as I'm writing this.   We were stuffed full and asking for the check when our server Sue gave us comment cards and mentioned future discounts (of course we took the bait). I found this practice slightly odd for what seemed to be an upscale place.  I asked if we were able to get any discounts this time because we were celebrating our engagement anniversary and she offered us the cheesecake and even wrapped it to go for us.  The service was excellent,  the food was excellent because of the price this would be more of a special occasion restaurant but I do see us going back."}
{"text":"Came here to try it out since we saw there was a location in Irvine, and since we were in Vegas, we decided to see how it was.  We didn't have reservations, and decided to come here at 4pm right when dinner starts to avoid the crowd.  The meat here was good, and not as salty as Fogo.  The service was excellent because we let our server know that we wanted a particular kind of meat, and it came by quickly.  The beef rib and the picante were the best.  My friends had the lamb and lamb chop, and the lamb chop was over cooked.  We stuff to the beef.  More choices came out as we were finished with our meal.  Also, the salad and hot bar station had some interesting stuff like lobster bisque and some kind of Brazilian fish stew, etc.  The cheese balls suck because it was dense even when it was hot.  They give you complimentary garlic mash potatoes and plantains.   Parking is abundant.  Make sure you go early so you don't have to wait long.  Will try the Irvine location later to compare."}
{"text":"So good, many good cuts of meat, perfectly cooked and full of flavor, great service! We left there stuffed and very happy!"}
{"text":"My first time here was spectacular. The service, ambiance, FOOD, was so worth the price. Their salad bar was perfectly stocked, not overwhelming to the point you couldn't decide on anything. The meats paired perfectly with any veggies you brought back on your plate. The lobster bisque was exquisite. So creamy and comforting. Honestly as far at the meats go, I can't choose a favorite. They were all perfectly cooked. I love my meat rare, practically still mooing, and they didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Real review: 3.5  Came here for a late lunch on a Sunday; the restaurant was completely empty. We were greeted by a hostess with a sour face who pretended like she didn't see my reservation. Eventually we got seated at the front of the restaurant, and the server explained the dining concept.  We went to the salad bar, which was a bit sad. There were limited choices and the vegetables didn't seem that fresh (we did come at 3:15 on a Sunday, so the food was probably sitting out for a while). It was nothing compared to Zed 451's in Chicago, or even Fogo De Chao's. The best thing from the hot bar were the potatoes au gratin. The soup of the day was very salty.   I tried all of the meats offered during lunch and my favorites were definitely the Picanha and the leg of lamb. Those were the most tender and best seasoned, although all of the meats were on the salty side.   Since it was my mom and brother's birthday, we got to choose two free desserts. We opted for the carrot cake and the chocolate cake. Both came in generous portion sizes and were delicious!   Our service throughout the entire meal was great. They were prompt when it came to bringing out sides to the table/changing our plates/refilling water.   Other than the snotty hostness and the salad bar, this was actually a pretty decent experience. The meats were generally pretty good and the dessert were a great ending to the meal."}
{"text":"Do you want to go somewhere that's super impressive but the same exact thing in every city that it's housed in? Then come here.   I gotta admit, I walked in those GIGANTIC doors and was floored (haha, get it? This is an architecture pun...) by how huge everything was. It really is a great place to feel like you're at a crazy expensive joint. At the same time, it really is just kinda like a cheesecake factory of meat.  If you've never been to a churrascaria place and you're in Station Square and you're looking for something impressive, this will definitely be interesting to you. HOWEVER, there are MUCH better places in Pittsburgh you can go. Yet, I will still explain to you what churrascaria is (because we just established that you haven't been to one before).  You pay two different options of prices here (other places have other options): everything or vegetarian. With the everything option, you get unlimited meat of different types brought to your table and then you can have unlimited stabs (haha, another pun) at the salad bar which has far more than salad at it. If you couldn't tell, if you get the vegetarian option, you just can eat at the salad bar.  THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER: the cheesy bread puffs they bring are like HEAVEN in your mouth! Eat them! Savor them! But don't fill up on them!  Anyway, moving onto the review of this actual location, having been to other churrascaria places, I was really disappointed by how few different cuts of meat they brought around. They were supposed to have some ridiculous number (like over 20 or something), but we were only ever brought about 8 different kinds. This really made me feel like they were trying to cheapskate everyone. At Green Forrest, we literally tried every single kind they make.  So basically? I'll never go here again, but if you're visiting Pittsburgh and don't have a car or something, sure... try this place out."}
{"text":"Dinner with wife,son and daughter. Food unparalleled, fantastic taste. Wait staff exceptionally good. Unacceptable noise level, feels as though your in a cafeteria. Wine prices far too high. Will definitely go back again but with ear plugs."}
{"text":"Excellent service and excellent food.  Will return next time in Vegas.  Had been to Texas de Brazil in Dallas, and really enjoyed the experience. Thankfully, the one in Vegas did not disappoint.  Me and my wife were able to use the bus system to get to town square and walked to the restaurant"}
{"text":"Holy meat!!! This place has so much damn meat.   Ok for $49.99 this is a good deal for meat lovers. I wouldn't say it's the best meat but it will do the job if you want ayce meat. Comes with a salad bar, not a typical salad bar though which is good. Tons of veggies, cheese, olives, and even some warm sides.  Come prepared to eat because there is just so much food.   Service is ok. It's just so crowded in here that it's hard to hear and they come around so fast with the meat that you barely have time to make a decision.  Just a little tip, bring an extra plate from the salad bar and use that for your meat because when they do come around and you say yes to the meat they will just place it anywhere on your plate."}
{"text":"Been here about 4 times now and the food is great. Sometimes the food is better times which is my only complaint. For my bosses birthday I purchased an E-certificate online and after a week of calling corporate and emailing, I decided to call here and ask for help, but was basically brushed off. Lady said she would take my info and forward to corporate, but was very short and borderline rude."}
{"text":"Amazing service and food. We went for my birthday celebration and had a wonderful time. Staff was friendly, courteous and knowledgeable. Try the South American beer. Perfect temperature and absolutely delicious. Salad bar was the best we have ever seen. Meat was delicious. We are planning on going back soon"}
{"text":"I had an exceptional experience today!! We're repeat customers, and the service has always been great. Today I was totally impressed-  our server Miguel provided extremely attentive service!! The meat was coming almost faster than we could keep up with. Excellent array of meats- the lamb was over the top. We will definitely be back! Ask to be seated in Miguel's section- he is stellar!!"}
{"text":"First Brazilian restaurant I visited in Las Vegas and it was an awesome experience! I celebrated my birthday here during dinner service on July 23. Of all the restaurants I've dine in Las Vegas this restaurant offers the best service! I can't count how many times our server refilled our glass and asked us how we were doing and if we had any other requests. Good job to the blonde lady server (sorry I forgot your name)! The meat here are out of this world! I highly recommend their filet mignon. Salad bar had a great selection and it tasted awesome! I left the restaurant beyond satisfied!"}
{"text":"Great Brazilian steakhouse. I have been to several and this one was one of the best ones. Meat flowing regularly. Huge selection. Excellent salad bar and options. We had good service when needed. Make sure you have a reservation, especially on the weekend."}
{"text":"Well up until my last visit I would have given this place 5 stars. Now will never go there again. Was in there a weeks ago with friends from out of town. Made the mistake of leaving a very expensive pair of sunglasses on the table. Let me add that they were in the center of table kinda tucked under the edge of my plate. My husband couldnt even see them. Due to how dark the glasses, table and lighting of the restaurant.I didnt even get out of the parking lot when I realized I didnt have them. I was gone less than 5 minutes. Went back in and the table wasnt even completely bused but the glases were gone. Their security footage shows that after we left the only people that went to the table were the server and the busperson. Corporate Risk management stated that they are not responsible for items left in their restaurant when you leave the table. So from now on I shall be dining at Fogo de Chao because I refuse to dine with thieves!"}
{"text":"Came to Vegas on a Monday and decided to start off with a great dinner. If you don't know how a Brazilian steak house works just remember the old childhood game of red light green light. Green means keep bringing the meat and red means stop for now. It's basically all you can eat meat and a salad bar included. Salad bar was excellent with Lobster bisque. Jasmine rice and beans were great.  Lamb chops were excellent! Carrot Cake was huge and very moist. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"First timers!  We should have listened to the server. He mentioned to not eat too much in the salad bar.  Well we got so excited that we HAD to try everything. Flipped the card to GREEN and all the meats came one after the other. Remember don't forget to turn your card to RED! Which I did and let me tell you, we were stuffed at the end of the night. Finished the night up with Brazilian Cheesecake. It was delicious! I would have enjoyed it more if I wasn't so full. Food coma coming along.   Lesson of the day:  LISTEN to your server. They know it best!  Our server was Wesley. He was fantastic. He always asked if we were doing okay, if we needed anything, if there was a particular meat we wanted, and fixed our napkins. He was nice to have a server. We hope to be served by him again in the future. Thank you Wesley for making our first time in Texas De Brazil an awesome experience."}
{"text":"I've been to many Texas de Brazil's all over the country and I was so excited to finally have one right in my backyard. The salad bar was amazing and the meats were delicious. Our server Ernie really made our experience a wonderful one. We will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"I visited Texas De Brazil this weekend with my mother and two of my siblings.  Each year we select a new place to visit, and include an agenda of events and restaurants.  This year we decided to \"kick off\" the weekend with dinner at this restaurant.    Everything started out great!  Our 45 min. wait was only 20 minutes, and once seated, we were quickly greeted by our server.  Our server's name is Maurice.  He began with an introduction of himself, along with a detailed explanation of the restaurant.  Which, I would like to add, is VERY unique!  Once Maurice finished his 10 minute spiel, he tried to encourage us to order alcoholic beverages (even though we all explained we were not interested).  We then helped ourselves to the salad bar, which was amazing!  A wide array of soup, salad, cheese, and a variety of various other small foods.  Once we were ready to begin the main course, we were greeted by many different meats.  All of which were truly mouthwatering, DELICIOUS!  The problem, and the 3 star rating, comes in at the conclusion of our meal.  We rarely saw our server, at least, until it was time for him to offer us dessert.  He tried to pursuade us to order something sweet to finish our evening.  We explained that we had already eaten more than we should have, yet he continued to be somewhat pushy.  When he finally realized we weren't budging, he seemed to get a little irritated.  At this point, we explained that we would like to receive our checks.  It took 30 minutes from the time we told him we wanted our check, and the time we actually received our checks.  And then, at the time we received the checks, we told Maurice that we had a coupon that we wanted to use.  Maurice seemed to be irritated even more by this.  Nonetheless, he walked away to allow us time to prepare payment.  From the time we received our checks to the time we were finally \"cashed out\", an HOUR had passed.  Mind you, only one time in that hour did Maurice stop by our table.  When he did, it was to inform us that the coupon was the reason things were taking so long.  I need to clarify that when we had first arrived to the restaurant, it was very busy.  But, now, around 9:30 at night, the restaurant was near empty.  So, to say that this was taking so long, seemed so completely ridiculous!  Not to mention, once we finally received our change and credit card slips to sign, Maurice lingered around our table.  It was so convenient for him to disappear during the hour we were waiting for our bills, yet once we were ready to leave, he was clinging on close by.  Needless to say, the service ruined the entire experience for us!  And, at $45 a person, it was VERY frustrating!  I sure hope others don't have the same experience!"}
{"text":"Felt like I was back in briefly Brazil.   Authentic tasting Brazilian food at a decent price.   I don't know why we waited so long to try it.  Everything was excellent!"}
{"text":"MISLEADING OFFER VIA PROMOTIONAL E-MAIL  An e-mail offer to receive a $150.00 dinner certificate mentions nothing about a minimum spend of $1500.00.  It clearly states you earn a $150 gift certificate for bringing at least 15 guests before a certain expiration date.  All criteria/terms were completely met.  When I signed the contract and paid my deposit, I observed the agreement states you earn a $50 gift certificate for each $500 spent. I pointed this out to the manager; he denied knowing what the promotional e-mail stated and could only go by the one-page contract.  The contract states your gift certificate will be mailed on the Monday following your event.  Not so.  Mine was mailed 22 days later than committed.  I'm going to enjoy my $100 gift certificate because I only spent $1200.00 that evening.  In fairness, I must say the food and especially the service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Great food, great staff, great service, great ambiance. Definitely won't be my first time here. Came here to celebrate an anniversary and the staff did not disappoint even on a busy weekend night!  The salad bar and soup was fresh and eloquent selections to enjoy. Wine list was superb and enjoyed a caipirinha. The banana caramelized with brown sugar side was superb in flavor. Just kept asking for it and the cheese rolls with the lobster bisque. The meat selections great from sirloin to filet mignon. All best meat quality.  Highly recommend when in town!!"}
{"text":"Very expensive restaurant. They charge $45 a person just for the food. Drinks are very good.They bring you plantains to the table but they are extremely sweet. I think they put sugar on it. The service is good but we felt a little rush. Waitress keep coming back asking \"everything ok? Need more drinks? Need a clean plate? Are you done eating meat? Ready for dessert? We were in and out in 1 hour. Maybe they want people to eat fast and leave."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed dining her. The service is amazing! The waitress and manager were so nice and friendly. They always made sure that we were all okay. The food is really good! I love the salad bar. When I was there, they had the au gratin potatoes and sautéed mushrooms that are to die for. My favorite meats were the lamb chop and filet mignon. The meat was so flavorful and tender. I cannot wait to return!"}
{"text":"I love coming here. They are expensive, but you get what you pay for. I've been here multiple times and have never had a bad experience. Even though they may be a little pricey, they do have a VIP card you can purchase to get a discount. The food is always delicious. The staff is always friendly. I live the variety that comes around. I've been to another Brazilian steakhouse that seemed to focus on sending the cheap meats around. This place is always on point."}
{"text":"Are you a meat and potatoes kind of person?  Forget the potatoes and be ready to eat meat-LOTS of meat. They do have a \"salad bar\" but it's not your typical salad bar. It's a little high end with charcuterie options, quinoa salads, and lots of other options. They also have soup. The Lobster Bisque is rather thin but full of flavor. You serve yourself from the salad bar and soup which both come with your meal. When you are ready to eat meat you sit at your table and the meat parade (as I call it) begins. They bring huge skewers of different meats to your table. We tried everything. The filet was melt in your mouth but we found ourselves liking the lamb the most. Of course they had pork tenderloin and other types of meat. They were all delicious. All of the servers were friendly and made the experience enjoyable.  It is a bit pricy but worth every penny."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time at this restaurant! My 1st time was for a birthday party for a friend and there were about 15 of us!  Prices - $49 per person or $25 for salad/soup bar only Drinks - we had a beer $6 and a glass of wine $11  The food at the salad/soup bar area is always very fresh and very good! The service our 1st time here was amazing but I'm thinking that's because a lot of people were ordering drinks and tipping very well!   The reason for my 3 stars is because of our 2nd time here, which was a date night for the hubby and myself that we had made prior reservations for and when we arrived we were told that it would be a minute for our table... A minute turned into about 20 minutes and then when we were brought to our table we were basically shoved into a back corner on a tiny table against a wall where we sat facing each other! I could not even get out of my chair without bumping into the people at the table beside ours! It also was a little frustrating because there was very little plate space, which each person gets 2 (one for the salad bar & one for your meats). Definitely was not enough room for 4 plates, our 2 drinks, the appetizer bananas and mashed potatoes they bring you... Along with a basket of rolls.  Also, we kept getting skipped by the meat servers bc I honestly don't think they could even see us.  I feel the servers cater more to the larger parties.  As far as price, it is a great price for the amount and quality of food as long as you can eat a lot! For someone like myself who can only eat a salad, a side or 2, and one steak filet... I could go to a fine restaurant and get just the same thing if not a little better for less. My husband loves it though, he can eat much more, so the fact that he can have steak, chicken, pork, lamb, etc in the same sitting is great!  I do recommend this restaurant for the quality of food and the experience of you have never been somewhere like this. Just be sure to come with an appetite. I do not recommend this for a party of only 2... It was very uncomfortable!"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong the selection is amazing and the food is yummy but I feel the price we pay doesn't do any justice. I'd stick to buffets than this. I do love the concept of this though, but after awhile you get sick of all the meats and some of it is a little too salty for my taste. The staff here is excellent and helpful, but this place wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Phenomenal experience here! Service was impeccable, server was very knowledgeable and gracious.  The salad bar was so much more than a salad bar and had a plethora of delectable salad toppings, and even their popular lobster bisque, which is not my fav but people rave about. Spend the $60 and get the discount card. It will be worthy it in the end since you get like, 10 dinners at half price Worth checking it out, but I think you can only purchase them in the actual restaurant.   Property is stunning inside and out. The hustle of all the workers running about is all part of the experience. Offering all the different types of meats available. Great place! Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"OH. MY. GAH!!!! If you want some tender, juicy, flavorful meat, GO HERE! We went for my cousins birthday and the food was off the charts. The salad bar was off the charts, and then the meat just sent everything over board. We ALMOST went to Fogo de Chao....so glad we changed our minds and decided to go here. EVERYTHING was great!!. We weren't huge fans of the Parmesan crusted items, but everything else was top notch. The seasoning was out of this world. Fogo de Chao and Samba don't have anything on TDB when it comes to flavor or meat selection. The lamb and filet mignon were our favorites. TDB is on the list for EVERY vegas trip from now on!"}
{"text":"Review for Take Out...  I normally dine in whenever I come here.  But now that i have a rambunctious 1 year old that can't sit still and climbs out of his high chair every second he gets a chance, it makes it so hard to enjoy a meal.   So I decided to try take out.  I ordered a pound of garlic  picanha & a pound of the flank steak.    I was highly disappointed.  Both cuts of meat tasted so bland, no flavor just the beefy taste.  Not at all like what they should taste like when you dine in.  For $18 dollars a pound i could have grilled up some steak on my grill at home and probably get a better result.    So disappointed!"}
{"text":"Me and my Husband Love this place, today was one of the best night at Texas, we had a reservation at 6:00 today, Alejandro I think was his name, Was our server, what a kind, professional and polite person, everything delicious as always, but the service today was more than amazing thanks to Him."}
{"text":"Hostess forgot our reservation-ended up waiting 20 minutes until we finally noticed all these people getting seated before us and then manager finally sat us. Other than that, food was amazing and our server Toni was awesome!"}
{"text":"I hadn't eaten in a week (I kid) it had only been since breakfast, but my family and I were hungry and what better place to eat then at an all you can eat Brazilian restaurant. My family (wife and 2 x kids 12 / 10) really enjoyed our experience here and the kids loved it too.   For lunch and adult meal is $30, $15 for kids 12 and under. The bread, salad, cheese station was also pretty good as well. Every piece of meat was divine, but my favorites were the beef cuts. We finished our meal off with an espresso and I had a cappuccino. We would definitely be back."}
{"text":"We used to come here for every family and business function. NO MORE! Service has consistently been getting worse. We had to track down a manager twice!! Once to find our sever after waiting 5 mins and no one came to our table, and the 2nd time to fix a problem on the bill. Our server was so slow and just overall kind of clueless. Manager could care less about REPEAT customers having a bad experience during a birthday celebration. We contacted corporate and pretty much got the same response with generic \"valued customer\" email. Wow! Good food but Applebee's  quality service. What a shame, but we value our dollars and will spend them somewhere else. Plenty of other options within 5 miles."}
{"text":"Went last weekend for my father in laws birthday. The service was outstanding from Brendan as well as each Gaucho that frequented our table with that sweet delectable protein.  We tried each and every one, several times. The house sirloin was my favorite. Could cut it with a fork."}
{"text":"Our absolute favorite place to take company when they are in town!!! We go for every special occasion"}
{"text":"Top notch quality food,  with so many flavors and meats to choose from.  We went on a Friday night,  and there was a 45 mine wait for the 2 of us,  but that was expected.  Head some great drinks at the bar, I recommend the coconut mojito.  Make sure you come on an empty stomach and get your money's worth!"}
{"text":"A must try for a Brazilian steakhouse. We have tried other Brazilian steakhouses and have looked at other spreads but we always find ourselves back here. We've also brought visitors here and never had any conplaints.  Great service, great selection and delicious food. We love the filet mignon and the beef ribs. Reservations recommended."}
{"text":"Awesome place! If you are a carnivore like me and you can eat, you will love this place! Loved everything from the bread to the salad bar to all the delicious meat you can eat. You must try the Brazillian cocktail! One of the best drinka ive ever tried. Was pretty expensive but i dont mind spending more for a great meal and not leaving hungry. Wait staff very professional with great service and super friendly! Def go back when in vegas again."}
{"text":"The two star is for the horrible seating arrangements we keep getting, AND the pitiful apologies that the \"managers\" give.  The food has always been an easy 5 star.  This opening mirrors my Jan 2015 review, and as you can see seating still sucks.  This time though, in addition to the small seating arrangements, we had a \"party\" going on next to us.  The unfortunate thing is that we were already half way through our meals, and to move just would have been too inconvenient.    Now we are all for a good time, but these inconsiderate hyenas were just awful.  They were a table of 8 with one girl who just had a LOUD, echoing, irritating laugh that would fill the whole back area.  I mean every table around us just kept looking over at them like, \"REALLY?!\"  At one point, I complained to the waitress who said she would tell a manager.  Well whether that happened or not, the hyenas just kept on like they were at a beer bust.  Why the manager did not go over (as I'm sure there were other complaints) is beyond me.  But that's what continues to bring on ratings such as mine.  The only other complaint is that I never got my bacon wrapped filet after asking 4 times!  Whatever.    We have been coming here for years.  We also bring our clients and their families several times a month.  Our parties would range from 8-16 every time.  As the years have gone by, the accommodating service has gone to the wayside.  My chief complaint is that they always try to seat more people than the table setting can handle.  For instance, 8 people on a 6 people setting with 2 people seated to the outside.  Well anyone that has eaten here knows that there is NO ROOM for people to eat like that.  I mean it is very uncomfortable and crowded once food starts coming.  Each time I explain this to the managers, I get the same excuse that they are booked and that's all that they have.  On one occasion, I  asked that they add a table and was told that they couldn't do that.  As I started to take my party out to leave, the manager came over and said that they would just add a table.  Really?  It take that to accommodate your patrons?  Sadly, we will no longer bring our clients to enjoy your food.  My family will still come because the food is awesome.  We will just crunch together and be uncomfortable."}
{"text":"I had reservations for 5:30 but arrived a little earlier. The hostess was still able to seat my party of four within no time. Our waiter was very attentive and paid attention to all of our needs. She recommend the red sangria to my girlfriend and I and it was delicious! The food was very well perhaps there should be a separate card for guest who do not eat pork. Just a recommendation, I love pork! lol The lights were kind of dim which made the experience more intimate than most Brazilian Steakhouse. We did not have dessert but the plastic immitations looked really appetizing to me. I thought it was real My girlfriend and her date did have two lattes. That were enjoyable as well.  Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"I had my birthday party there, they sent me a email coupon which is $20 off to used on my birthday. My birthday was on 6/17 and it was Father's day, they told me due to the holiday we can't use the coupon. We were so upset, it didn't make any sense and they truly didn't care about their customers, not even tried to make it right."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant of all time. Steaks are perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection. Customer service is exceptional. A bit pricey but you get what you pay for and definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Very Good. All you can eat.  Meat of all kinds and lots of it. Cooked anyway you like it. Salad bar was also Great.  Service was also great.  If your a meat eater this place is a must when in Pittsburg. It is Zuverman approved."}
{"text":"Outstanding! I've eaten at several of the other locations, and I'm happy to welcome them to Pittsburgh. They have only been open a week.  I went with my niece (who has never been before), her husband (who has been to several locations, as well) and their sons.  Everyone had a good time. The Boys were in heaven.   They have done a great job with this location. The service was outstanding. We were taken care of without feeling smothered. The flow of the meat and the knowledge of the servers was great. They took time to explain what they were serving and finding out the favorites.  Our main waiter, Jonathon, was attentive and friendly. He took time to make the 'newbies' feel welcome.   The salad bar is worth the price of admission, but the different meats is the reason we all come.  They were all prepared perfectly.  The Boys loved anything wrapped in bacon (and who can blame them).  Even dessert was amazing - save room for the Bananas Foster Pie.   Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Had an excellent evening at this restaurant. The various options available at the salad bar were delicious, and the plethora of beef, chicken, lamb, and pork are all one can want. I did save room for desert ordering the three layer chocolate mousse cake.  I can't forget to mention our server Patricia who really was one of the best servers we have ever had."}
{"text":"The meats they bring around on the swords is very tasty The salad bar by itself is fabulous and more than enough to make a meal. Sometimes you need to flash down the servers to get what you actually want. I have been too others where they have a fish too, that would be a nice option."}
{"text":"Originally I would have given it 1 start but our waiter saved it!  I had booked for 7:45 to celebrate our daughters 14th birthday with 6 people. We arrived an 55 minutes early ( I had looked at the clock wrong). I inquired if we could get in earlier and was handed a \"beeper\" and told we could catch happy hour in the bar for the next 10 minutes until the bar . (Mind you, we have 4 children under 18 with us and the ditzy hostess saw them) I took the 4 children outside and walked around the mall for awhile And left my husband to grab a \"happy hour wine\". He stood at the bar for well over 10 minutes and by the time the bartender go to him they informed him that Happy Hour had ended. The children and I came back at 7:40 and inquired about how much longer and I was told 5-10 minutes. At 8pm ( 15 minutes after our reservation) we still were not seated! After 8 we were finally being seated and I noticed MANY empty tables to hold 6 people.  Once we were settled in the waiter made us forget the long wait. He made sure we were well taken care of and had everything we desired. The food was ok. I personally have had better meats ( the signature steak was ok as was the lamb) but the salad bar was great and the children loved the mashed potatos that were brought to the table."}
{"text":"I have been to Texas de Brazil numerous times and to various locations. My family and I fell in love with the restaurant at it's Aruba location. Simply awesome experience. However, the experience in Pittsburgh has been quite different. This first visit to the station square location was good - busy Friday night, pretty speedy service. Yesterday my family and I went to celebrate a birthday and it was a Sunday. We had reservations but still had to wait 20 minutes to be seated in a fairly empty dining room. Once sat, our waiter was nice and helpful and served us accordingly. The biggest problem with our dinner were the gauchos! We sat with empty plates (and bellies) waiting for them to stop by with a delicious skewer of meat. We were either passed by or they all went to a party of ten and were instantly cleaned out. It was pretty annoying considering the price of the place. I said something to our waiter and it helped...a little. Maybe the point in all of this is just not to go on Sundays."}
{"text":"Favorite all you can eat restaurant in Las Vegas, everything here is delicious and for the price it isn't that bad at all I would recommend it to anyone I know."}
{"text":"Very attentive staff. Delicious meats. Great buffet. Reasonably priced compared to Fogo, its competitors."}
{"text":"Ballsmazing! Our server, Adam S., was one of the best I have had at any establishment, ever!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in the world !! Everything is perfect!  Meat lovers heaven!!!"}
{"text":"Meat galore, and we loved it! First time experience, and it was great. Service was on point, my plate was never empty. If you love well seasoned meat, and a good salad bar this place is for you. My husband, and I will be back."}
{"text":"Awesome food better staff this is the place to go . Garlic picanha is my personal favorite."}
{"text":"The food was just OK, the service was slow, and I almost fell off my chair when I saw the bill!  The guys who deliver the meat are really quick, but our waiter was extremely slow. I finished my drink about 1/2 through dinner and never had the opportunity to put in another order... Our waiter just diapered. I finally had to ask the hostess for the bill because this guy was no where to be found.  I was shocked to see that my bill was $120 (not including tip) for two people and two adult beverages. For that price I would have rather gone to Hyde Park across the street and gotten a better quality meal."}
{"text":"Went here for a dinner out with husband, brother in law and his girlfriend. We had our 4 month old with us and they were wonderful with accommodating her car seat.  We had a decent bottle of wine and the food decent. Great salad and side bar and meat on skews. What more can someone ask for? My only dislike is it cost over $100 for 4 of us. We will go again but this is a very special occasion type place for us."}
{"text":"I love me some good brazilian bbq.  This place is pretty comparable to Fogo De Chao, and a smidge cheaper.    The service is great.  Once we got our plates from the buffet portion, we pretty much got 4-5 types of meats on our plates within 5 minutes.  The waitress said they had kinds of meat, but I don't think we got that many.  I find that the quality of meat is not as good as Fogo, but it was still pretty good.  The filet mignon was super tender.  Their buffet section had a lot of options.   The lobster bisque was pretty good as was the smoked salmon.    This place is definitely worth trying out if you want something that's not a typical vegas buffet.  On a side note, the soda is not free refills.  You just get a small bottle."}
{"text":"Well you certainly get what you pay for. This is definitely a place for a great meal or to splurge for a special occasion. We came for my birthday and they gave us a great dessert for free with a lit candle. You get to just keep eating different kinds of meat until you're full, how great is that? They also have a great wine selection and a salad bar. Great soups, great cocktails, great desserts. Our waiter was very friendly and the meats kept passing through the room quickly for us to have."}
{"text":"The \"salad\" bar is a meal unto itself.  Everything on it was fresh and delicious and an amazing variety of choices.  The meats were good, altho I must say that after the salad bar, I really didn't eat much of the meat, altho what I had was very good.  If and when I return, I think I'll just have the salad bar.  Our server, Peter,  made the evening, however.  He was friendly, efficient, smiled, and made it seemed like he really enjoyed taking care of us.  The place was packed, and yet we were seated at our arrival time, and while dinner was leisurely, we never felt ignored.  There were ten of us at our table, and everyone loved the evening!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the food not a fan of the price!  Honestly, I could NEVER eat $50 plus dollars of a meal!! What I do like about restaurants like this one is the options.  I'm a picker.  I like to pick at different things but picking is costly! Haha.  Side dishes are good and I liked the selection.  Much better than Fogo where it's mostly just a salad bar.   My friends and I had dinner here this past Saturday night while in Vegas celebrating my birthday.  12 of us.  Service was good, ambiance was nice, food was good.    I've been to many Brazilian places and this is one of my better experience.  Would I come here again? Sure, if I want to blow 100 bucks."}
{"text":"Reservation was 6:45, got there at 6:40, basically empty in the place, told, we are working on your table of 8 now. Fine, whatever, no biggie! The rest of our party comes, they seat us at a table that was \"set up\" already when we walked in the first time! Whatever!  Food: 5 stars plus Service: 3 stars (that's pushing it) Pricing: You pay for what you get, it's a ton!  Quality: 4 stars, we had people at the table who do not like rare or medium, had to beg basically for more well done meat, which was a struggle and waited and waited! Was told by a \"meat server\" one guy had to leave and it backed things up, blah blah blah!  We were told at the end (when we were stuffed) there were bbq ribs, really where? Never came to us, until we could barely eat another thing! Salad bar: 5 stars! Perfect!  Chocolate cake: when you offer it, be sure that the server tells the table it has nuts on the bottom! Have a bad allergy to nuts, and surprise ordered and ate it, thankfully before I realized and saw them! Fail! And I would have said something but it was a birthday and didn't want to embarrass or cause drama at the table!   Now the one only terrible thing, it was ICE COLD in there as the 3 hour night went on! Shivering in a restaurant, not cool! Yes it was 85 OUTSIDE but didn't need to be 50 inside!   In comparison to Brasa, Brasa has better service hands down! But all other areas of this place beats it hands down!  I had gotten a $25 coupon for signing up for newsletters, be careful, you CANT use it on Saturdays! Stupid!  Will I go back, eh, not sure!  (thank God I didn't eat the nuts on the cake or this review would have been brutal)"}
{"text":"This is my first pick for all our date nights! I've been going here for years, especially during my second pregnancy with all my cravings. The staff is very nice and professional as they are attentive to all their guest needs. The food is always fresh and rarely was the meat ever brought around not hot. Some Brazilian steakhouses will rotate the floor for a long period of time with the meat, but not here. Almost always sizzling hot to your table. This salad bar is by far the best one in town, from salad to ceviche onion to shrimp to salmon to soups to delectable sauces, so on and so on. I tried a few Brazilian steakhouses in town, but nothing compares to the quality and experience you have at Texas de Brazil!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Such a treat to come here once a year while we're in Las Vegas. Everything was tasty, the service is awesome and the staff terrific. One of the members of our party has a gluten allergy, none of their marinades have gluten and now the rolls they serve are also gluten free, bonus, they're really yummy!  Another plus for them is that they give a military discount, thank you for honoring our veterans. Can't wait to get back there next year!!"}
{"text":"Uno de Mis Faboritos y Mejores Restaurantes que Siempre que los Encuentro tengo que llegar a Comer."}
{"text":"Great selection of items from the salad bar. Service is very attentive. My favorite meat was the flank steak. Juicy and tender. The lobster bisque was also great!  A nice place for a celebration!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience at one of my favorite restaurants. Piping hot food was everywhere in this place, 16 different cuts of meat make this place a guys paradise. My server Ritchie was on his job that he even got me to buy a dessert after he quoted the menu verbatim lol. I tried all 16 different cuts of meat and will say that some of them are a little salty but with a side of adult beverage it's all good. I will certainly recommend this place to anyone looking for fine dining and scared to take a try on one of the many Vegas buffets lol. Price is about the same as in DC, expect to spend over $100 per couple but you will certainly get your money worth."}
{"text":"Expertly cooked meats and delicious sides. Nice variety of items at the salad bar and hot items bar. Do yourself a favor and grab a tiny bowl and get a delicious sauce or two to dip your meat in. (My favorite was the chimichuri with my steaks, and the roasted garlic on the warm bread). The sushi was surprisingly very good!  Not to be missed, the lobster bisque! Oh man....so delicious, and in a buffet environment no less! I've had a lot of lobster bisques, and this one is definitely tops! Also....au gratin potatoes. Try some, do it - maybe mix in some of that roasted garlic too!  Okay, so everyone goes here for the meats and I can definitely see why. They make it easy for newbies and you get a red/green sign to signal the servers to stop by, but really they were all asking regardless if it was red (pass for now). I was partial to the beef cuts, but the chicken and sausages were acceptable. After a few bites of sausage, the salty factor caught up to me and it was no longer enjoyable. If dining with others, perhaps split a portion your served, that way you can sample more and decide what tastes best for you. My husband I used this method and we were able to sample almost everything we wanted, and then some.  Worth the hype, and at the price I could not have asked for better cooked steak. You definitely get what you pay for. Utilize the reservation feature on their website!"}
{"text":"Whehew was that one of the BEST churrascaria's i've been to...including in Sao Paulo!  I was a little apprehensive looking at the reviews compared to the other Texas de Brazil on the East Side but the moment we walked in, super service.  I had to put my sticker on green again as I passed on a couple of things that traditionally are kinda just ok (chicken, pork)....then after I tried a piece of it from my wife, was surprisingly shocked!!  Even the items on the salad bar were awesome and what a variety!  Even the server in training was awesome!"}
{"text":"Went with a group of co-workers, probably 12 of us. It felt like they were bringing the same 3 cuts of meat around time after time. Service was great! Food was just OK. The lobster bisque was salty without much flavor. A few of the steaks were very good.  Vegas has a lot of tough competition for a place like this."}
{"text":"Very disappointing,  On a recent trip to Pittsburg decided to give it a try.  We  waiting an hour to be seated (arrived at 8 not seated until 9) even though the restaurant was half empty,  We were expecting different types of meat  (lamb, beef, chicken etc.)as has been our experience at other Brazilian steakhouses.  All we received was filet and filet with bacon, no other cuts of beef or any other meats!  What!  I thought we were to be served other meats.  Not worth the money we spent.  After speaking with the manager all he kept saying was \"the good thing is you are still in the restaurant\", but no change in meats..  If I wanted just filet, I would have gone to an American steakhouse and not pay $50/per person."}
{"text":"Took my wife there for our eighth year anniversary first time there. It was amazin, the food is awesome, and the staff was great. It was a great experience, we'll worth the price, good food good people in North East  OHIO...."}
{"text":"My wife was having a Tupperware party tonite, so that seemed like a great excuse to try the new Texas de Brazil with my friend Sam. The reservation was easy to make by phone (I'm a boomer). Paige was our server and she did great. Two managers stopped by and checked on us. I can't say enough good about this place. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I've been to a few Texas De Brazil's but nothing like this. The staff is super welcoming. From the lobby to the bathrooms you can tell the style was handpicked and crafted to demonstrate simplicity with up class modern art. The lobby chairs look like reused airplane panels with leather upholstery. The staff was very attentive when we arrived folding napkins every time we left the table and replacing our plates with fresh ones ever so often.   The food was displayed beautifully! The salad bar had salads, meat, cheeses - which I love! But they also had potatoes, mushrooms, salmon - that my family liked. They offer military discounts as well, which my parents really like! #supportourtroops!  They had a special going on this month that had stuffed jalapenos wrapped in bacon - yum! The meats rotate but you really have to ask for something if it's not coming out. I had to do that with filet mignon but it still took 30 minutes to come out... They were busy though with a lot of other peoples request and we still had other rotating meats and a great view of the wine collection to occupy us.  I would definitely come back to this location when I'm out in Vegas."}
{"text":"I have eatin all over the world and I would rate this dinner experience in the top 3!  Service was great, food was delicious and price was right!!!! Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! The food is so great! The flank steak is so mouth wateringly delicious. The price isn't bad either weekday lunch $33 and weekend is $50 (with desert and soda included). The food is always on point! The service is great. Drinks are always full and they make sure you have everything you want and ask for any special requests you may have."}
{"text":"I really like TDB.  We went there because they had a Vetrans day special Buy one get one free.  or the Vet got his meal free.  It was super crowded.  So we wnt to the bar and had a drink.  Before we we able to finish, we got to go to our table.  I could just do the salad bar....I acually did for the most part.  I think I just got 1 slice of meat.  I loveeeee there salad bar.  They do have some meat on there, I love the smoked salmon, this is the only place where I eat smoked salmon.  It dosn't have that raw meat texture.  So my salad was delish.  The food is delish, we like everything, except the price.  We don't eat enough to pay full price.  So when we see a special like this is when we like to go."}
{"text":"This place is straight amazing. The staff is very friendly and attentive. The quality of their meats are bar none. I've heard many good things about this place, I'm happy to say they are all true.   Awesome!"}
{"text":"The reason I don't bother going to casino buffets in Vegas anymore, I first came to Texas de Brazil about 7 years ago. I've been to other Brazilian BBQ restaurants like Fogo & they all come up short in comparison to Texas. I've even been to the one in Miami beach & they have the same quality as this Las Vegas location.  Whenever I'm in town I always bring friends that have never been here, and they always love this place. It's a must try, if you plan on going for dinner during the weekend make sure you call a few days in advance for a reservation to get the time you actually want, this place gets packed on the weekends."}
{"text":"***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 74/100***  No better way to celebrate a birthday than stuffing yourself silly with mouth watering meats and everything in between. TDB is a carnivore's paradise, from filet mignon to flank steak to lamb chops and leg of lamb the list goes on and on but I have to say the top sirloin steak is my favorite. The salad bar and sides alone are worth coming for but of course the meats are the stars of the show. There's nothing much to add to what's already been uttered again and again about this place being good, it's one of those places you just have to try for yourself at least once.   For me personally, I never get my moneys worth at AYCE places so for next time, Friday lunch (they're only open Fri-Sun for lunch) at about $33 would probably be my best bet. According to our server Adam (who by the way was awesome!!!) There's only a few item difference in the salad bar area between lunch and dinner, but as far as the meat goes it's the same line up. Food, ambiance and service was all on point which makes it a 5 star experience."}
{"text":"Awesome food, service and atmosphere....better than Fogo de Chao.  A must-visit if you want to experience a Brazilian Steakhouse."}
{"text":"First time customer. Service was amazing. Salad bar had a wide variety of fresh and tasty items to pick from. The meats were served in a novel fashion and all we sampled were very, very good. We started planning our next visit on our way out the door."}
{"text":"I went for my birthday and the food was great and the sever was great Mathew did a great job. Very happy with the service I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Go hungry!!! The a flank steak was perfect. Sushi on the salad bar. Service was perfect."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Conclusion - Better than Fogo de chow. Buffet had great options. Service was awesome."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time I've eaten here.  And it has been amazing both times.   Service outstanding and the food amazing.  Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING ALERT. My wife and I are regulars (we bought 2 VIP cards) and we did love this place until last night (4/5/17). My wife is a vegetarian so she ate from their salad bar. She has been vomiting every hour or so since midnight. I ate mostly from the cooked meat selections and I am fine but she is VERY sick. Think twice about eating anything there that is with cream/mayonnaise (potato salad, lobster bisque, etc.) I would stick with vegetables and meat only. This is no reflection on then wait staff (our waitress Paula for instance is awesome). VERY disappointed, we won't be returning.  Update #1: I called the restaurant on 4/6/17 and spoke to the general manager. He was 100% unfazed that we are VIP card carrying customers nor that we are regular customers. They are going to \"conduct an internal investigation\" and they have refused any sort of compensation for our $100+ dinner.  Great way to treat loyal customers, don't you think?  Update #2: My wife is running a temperature of 101 now.  Update #3: \"Tim\" (no last name) from Texas De Brazil's corporate office called me and said because no one else has reported an illness yet, this is an isolated incident and oh, yeah, I hope your wife feels better."}
{"text":"Service A+ Food A+ Everything A+  This place has good service it has great food and an amazing ambiance.  My friends and I came here just for a normal dinner. Starting from the beginning of our dinner until the end, the waiters and meat carvers were professional and courteous. Whenever we requested for anything they always followed through. There wasn't a single instance where we asked for a meat to come and it didn't come. We also had special requests such as rare filet mignon or rare lamb and it always came!  As for their food, the meats were cooked to perfection! Their cuts were always juicy and flavorful. My personal favorite was the house social and the one that comes on a big plate. My friends really enjoyed their rare filet mignon. The salad bar was well stocked with both warm foods and cold salads. I fell in love with their potatoes au gratin. The mushrooms were really good to and you can use the sauce to dip the meat in for extra burst of flavor."}
{"text":"You don't need a special occasion to eat well!! Every time we come here we're surprised with how wonderful the food and service is!! We will definitely be back for years to come!!!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite restaurant to go to in Las Vegas! Plenty different amazing meats cooked the way you want it! And we got an amazing server, Adam, he was so quick with the orders, and checked in every 3 mins to see if we are okay or need more food! OVERALL this is a great place u suggest this to a family or a date to go on!!"}
{"text":"This place is the best, especially when your starving. The salad bar, numerous cuts of meat and service is what makes it a great place to eat. Make a reservation and save yourself a long wait."}
{"text":"I love the concept. Unfortunately my last two experiences soured my view of this restaurant. On grand opening day was the only day I enjoyed the food. Ever since, I feel like they discontinued seasoning the meat. It all just tastes like old grease. The bacon wrapped chicken made me gag. If my eyes were closed I could've never guessed that it was chicken and bacon. The last time, I brought 2 guests at my treat. To save money we all ordered water. Low and behold the water was $6 each and our water poured our water from 3 seperate huge blue glass bottles. All 3 of us could've shared one bottle. We each took our bottle home because they were still half full. I'm still mad I didn't order a Pepsi. Had I known if be charged  $18 for water I would've ordered soda cheaper."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service, vast selection of wine and spirits. Had a great dinner here."}
{"text":"Today we came for my boyfriends birthday, I set up the reservation through Open Table and they had the table set and ready upon arrival.   After we all sat down from the salad bar we quickly started getting offered different meats, bacon wrapped chicken, flank steak, filet mignon, bacon wrapped cream cheese stuffed jalapeños, potatoes, bread, if our plates started getting empty they would ask for any personal requests and were happy to bring them out as asked!   I could go on and on about each individual choice but you won't be disappointed with anything you choose! The service was amazing and prompt, our glasses stayed full and plates stayed covered. I had the creme brûlée after our feast, and was 110% satisfied. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and have enjoyed it very much. I took my husband here for his birthday. We were seated very fast, even a little before our reservation time. Our waiter helped us immediately. He asked if we were celebrating a special occasion and we let him know about the birthday. When he saw we were choosing a bottle of wine he gave great suggestions and let us know they had a special with 50% off a second bottle which was a great deal! They had a good range of options ranging from $35 on up, very reasonable prices.  Of course the meat was the star and fantastic as always. So many choices! All very well cooked. And the salad bar was terrific too. Definitely try the lobster bisque if it's available.  As a final nice touch the waiter offered the desserts and they do a little extra for birthdays. I chose an amazing cheesecake with chocolate on the bottom, caramel on top and they had the plate nicely decorated with happy birthday written in chocolate. This was a terrific meal and experience for a decent price. The two bottles of wine, two meals and dessert came in around $160 without tip. I've paid way more for this quality of food at other places."}
{"text":"Everything is amazing. Food is worth every penny and the the service is attentive and well mannered. I will be back every time in Vegas. Hands down best buffet style restaurant I've ever been to."}
{"text":"We dined in for a birthday dinner. I had the salad bar and he had the complete meal. The salad bar was great I wasn't to hungry so I figure the salad bar would work and it did.  On the other hand my company did not like the meat at all, he ate maybe one piece of the garlic sirloin (i think). The rest was wasted. He just didn't like the taste of the other meats. So we really should have paid for two salad bars.  I had a mango (brazilian) drink it was fantastic and he loved the black Brazilian beer. They were really busy and service was a bit slow but not horrible. The manager who was on that night was a pleasure to speak with. So not really sure if we will return but I am glad we went."}
{"text":"Kay and I made reservations months in advance for our 4 year anniversary dinner at Texas De Brazil and were not let down by any means. In fact, having only seen churrascarias on television beforehand, my expectations of a grand feast were not only met but exceeded from the beginning of our meal until closure. The term \"epic\" may be overused these days, but it most certainly deserves to be affixed to this astonishing South American churrascaria located in Pittsburgh's Station Square.   As you enter, you're whisked to your table by hosts that almost move like dancers, the staff at TDB performing like it's opening night for a show on Broadway, and the critics are in the first row.   A vast salad bar is yours for the taking...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uts_gdx6VU  You'll find...  Sushi  Salads with myriad dressings.  One of the most chunky and kingly potato salads ever crafted, its mayonnaise dressing elegant and simple, its flavors extravagant.   Grilled asparagus.  Hearts of Palm  Fresh Mozzarella.   Smoked salmon.  Need I go on?   One trip alone will do a glutton in, and yes, this is an odyssey of gluttony made respectable. There's so much to sample that one can easily neglect the steakhouse portion of the meal (a much less expensive salad bar-only reservation package is available for the timid and/or frugal), but that would be a tragedy.   Men in vaguely ancient, martial attire wield long, imposing, sword-like knives and  staves that carry on them exquisitely glistening, unending specimens of meat, all of it seemingly medium-rare, every morsel serving as a reminder that the carnivorous is at heart, purely carnal.   Leg of Lamb, bacon-wrapped chicken breasts, filet mignon, naturally-cased sausages that pop when bitten into, parmesan-coated pork loins, flank steak, alcatra, picanha, braised beef ribs, obscene amounts of sirloin...I was overwhelmed, forcing myself to flip the green card over to red to stop the glorious onslaught of prime protein, all of it shaved from the metal spits in mouthwatering, sublimely seasoned flaps that contained ideal amounts of flavorsome fat.   I wanted to try everything. Everything!   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYFGTf3M3Sc  I'd become so intoxicated by the food, I'd forget what I'd already tried. Plate upon plate of their pão de queijo (cheese bread) threatened to fill my stomach beyond capacity, the tiny, chewy balls of dough and parmesan proving addictive, irresistible. Mounds of perfectly fluffy, buttery garlic mashed potatoes nearly did the same as did the egregiously scrumptious, syrupy, sugar-coated sweet fried bananas which almost made dessert unnecessary...but dessert is always necessary...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4xTuv5dpBs  Coconut Chess Pie, Chocolate Mousse Cake, and Pecan Pie were all shared by us both. Yes, we ordered 3 desserts, going far out of bounds. We had become extremists. When would enough be enough???  The chess pie and mousse were each full of angelic, saccharine cream while the pecan pie brought us down to earth with its molasses, shoofly mouthfeel and nutty essence.  Our exorbitant bill (smack!) reflected our exorbitant appetites. We felt as if we'd been led astray by Hunter S.Thompson for a lost weekend only for him to kick us out of his limousine, abandoning us on a roadside, never to speak to us again. Yet we were without regret.   Dinner at Texas De Brazil is an evening of sheer indulgence not for those whose will is strong. To show restraint here is to be cheated out of something juicy, rich, savory, sweet, unforgettable. You are meant to eat everything you see and everything you shouldn't. You are meant to go home in a near-coma after attempting to stagger out of the dining room under your own power. Cast your inhibitions aside and have the meal of your life with that person most central to your life.   P.S. The service provided by everyone in the house from front to back was the absolute tops. The entire crew went out of their way to ensure that we left undoubtedly satisfied, and we were undoubtedly satisfied times 3."}
{"text":"Texas De Brazil is my favorite restaurant!!! I was elated to see that one was being built in my neighborhood. This place is a meat lovers paradise!!!! Go hungry, you won't leave disappointed. The salad bar offers continuous dining and has an awesome selection. Did I mention the bar selection....CHEERS!!!! Great place!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing, the salad bar has a huge variety including: hot items ( sautéed mushrooms, lobster bisque, jasmine rice, black beans) on the chilled bar ( salad, cheeses, grilled squashes, pineapple slices, asapagus, tomatoes bacon).  The meats were perfectly seasoned.  I had more than when I go to Fogo.  They had the brazillian sausage, bacon wrapped chicken, bacon wrapped filet mignon, garlic filet mignon, al caprino, lamb chops and a few others that I can't recall.  The waitress was great and very attentive.  The hostesses could be a little friendlier, they didn't really greet us when we entered, instead just told us to wait and they will call us when it's our turn.  But overall I had a great experience dining here and I will definitely be returning.  Make sure you make reservations though!"}
{"text":"Amazing selection and service! My friends took me while visiting from Portland and I can't wait to visit again on my next visit to Vegas."}
{"text":"Just 2 of us.  No reservations.  Hostess said just a few minutes.  Turned into 10. Awkwardly standing by door, no seats or waiting area.  From the door, I see meat cravers walking around.  First thought.... doesn't look sanitary.  Thinking of some guests coughing then the craver walking through the vapor mist gave me the shivers.   Finally seated.  Waitress went through a 10 mins schpeel on absolutely nothing then we were told theres the all you can eat buffet and plates.  The buffet food was plenty and good.  Don't fill up on it as you won't be able to eat all the meat samples.  All the meat was spicy and hot.  Food great.  Atmosphere great."}
{"text":"We haven't been here for a few years so we made this our final night dinner with our friends we were staying with.  It never disappoints.  I could truly just eat the salad bar...it's by far the best I've ever come across.  However, I've never been able to not indulge in the meat orgasm.  Our fave is still the garlic sirloin, but I was just as enamored with the Brazilian sausage this time.  There's just nothing to say if you haven't experienced it other than \"What are you waiting for?\""}
{"text":"Definitely LOVEEEEE this place! It's so cool and such a different environment like no other restaurant. Staff is super attentive and their selection of meat is definitely delicious. Salad bar is amazing!"}
{"text":"I'm on a low-carb diet, so this place seemed like a good idea. I tried the Pichana, Chicken Wrapped in Bacon, and Parmesan Pork Loin. All very good. And the pricing is pretty decent. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"Service is great. Food is even better. Had a margarita, it was alright, too warm for my taste. Other than that will be coming back for sure. Salad bar is amazing as well!"}
{"text":"This place was great.  I have been to a few Brazilian restaurants and this one is the best I have tasted.  Most important aspect is meat temperature and every meat was perfect.  You could even specify temperature and they would bring you a skewer at that temp.  Service was great, ambiance was great, the fact that it wasn't in a busy casino was great.   Go hungry and it's worth the money!"}
{"text":"We went to this place for my husband's birthday.  I loved their fresh salad bar, fresh and delicious chimichurri sauce, my husband loved their all different type steaks, filet mignon,prime rib,  and my daughter loved their banana cream pie.  Top notch service, all these gentlemen serve meat very friendly, especially our table waiter Douglas did an awesome job, he is fast, professional and very family friendly.  Me and my husband would like to say Thank you again and highly recommend the manager to promote him!  :)"}
{"text":"We finally tried this place a few weeks ago. Not worth the money if you ask me. The food wasn't that great. The meats they bring to your table was just ok. I wasn't impressed. The salad bar was nice with a decent selection of items. The hot bar, not very good. They had potatoes augratin , they were super starchy. Some type of black beans that looked like a pile of mush. The atmosphere was very nice. The servers who brought meats to your table were super nice. But my server was a total snob. My husband & I had never been there before & I asked a simple question and she treated me as if I were stupid. Wow, really? I went to Brasa grill downtown Cleveland a few years back and I have to say, if we ever decide to go to a Brazilian steakhouse again, it will be brasa grill. Texas de Brazil, stop hiring such snobby servers, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Food was good but the service and GM were terrible!!!  Went there for the good friends bday, they sat us late even though we had reservations and plenty of tables were open. They were out of things and when asked when they would be ready the GMs response was not tonight. We spent over $700 and the idiot would not even buy us a drink or apologize and was extremely rude. Never and I mean never going back until that jerk is gone."}
{"text":"Texas de Brazil is an award wining Brazilian Steakhouse restaurant. The various cuts of meats are never disappointing and are always hot. This place is wonderful to host a dinner a party, because everyone can find something they love; between the salad bar, the soup bar, the meats, and dessert this place is surely a crowd pleasure.   However, I will say that this place can become very crowded and you must submit the exact number of people in your party, because if you must add an additional person at the last minute, this restaurant is not willing to accommodate the change. Lastly, if you are celebrating a special event, make sure you keep any birthday cakes, balloons, rings, or any special celebration enhancements with you as they will charge you a $15.00 holding fee (which I have never heard of before in my life), but they do. So, I now know that in future when I wish to celebrate a special event with this restaurant, I know that I will not ask them to hold my cake for me."}
{"text":"I have been to quite a few Texas de Brazil's and this one has been the one I've enjoyed the least. It seemed like all of the meats that they brought out were terribly cooked and not as tender and juicy as other locations. The service was average too! We waited quite a while to be presented with more meats and when they did come out it was the meat we've already had. For the amount you pay for a meal at this restaurant, you would think the service would be better. I don't think we'll be visiting this location again!"}
{"text":"First visit last night to celebrate the birthdays of two famiky members. Party of six. Location and decor is great and the food is fantastic. I especially enjoyed all the exciting choices on the salad bar. Had to lower my rating, unfortunately, due to the service. Hostess and meat servers were top-notch, but our table server was less than attentive. We had to ask for clean plates after finishing our salads; drinks were not refilled in a timely manner; dirty plates were not removed;  and our server disappeared for at least 15 minutes more than once. My mother waited 10 minutes for a cup of coffee, which was eventually brought to her by another server. Very disappointing component to what could have been a memorable evening."}
{"text":"Everything was excellent! I loved the food the salad bar surpassed my expectations this is a pricey restaurant by the looks of it but it is worth is !"}
{"text":"Great service and really good food. Nothing to complain about except the obvious issue that if you are hearty eater then the $43 per person is reasonable--but if you eat light you won't feel like this even a reasonable value.  Every morsel was a treat and the salad bar was full of choices. Very allergy friendly."}
{"text":"This is the Olive Garden of Brazilian steakhouses. I've been eating at Brazilian steakhouses in Vegas since the 90s, when we only had one. In terms of decor, we've come a long way, but this place is still not life-changing like others may have you believe.   I have nothing negative to say about my experience. The servers were attentive and they remembered that I like my meat well-done. The sides were very appetizing. I just hate stuffing myself with meat until I'm about to burst--to get my money's worth.   I know lots of people who come here for special occasions like a birthday or anniversary, but I ask myself...why??? With so many exquisite restaurants on the Strip alone, I just don't see the appeal."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. We got in very fast and started with the salad bar. The smoked salmon and lobster bisque were amazing. The garlic serloin  was equally amazing. Also the staff is very friendly and crazy fast."}
{"text":"50$ round-trip cab fare from where we stayed. Salad bar was 24.99 and excellent and all you can eat. As far as the meats, Pampas in Planet Hollywood mall way better, closer, and more selections of meats. I had very very odd bland meat, from ribs to lamb. Or very salty. The best and consistent was the flank, London broil and their sirloin. 121.00 plus 59$ cab fees was the dinner night"}
{"text":"I was very impressed by the cuts available for restaurant week! For $35, the dinner included lamb chops and filet mignon. Most restaurant week deals in other Brazilian BBQ establishments in other cities (such as Fogo de Chao and Chima) have removed these items to cut costs so I'm very pleased that TdB stands ahead of the pack in that regard.   Furthermore, I tend to prefer my steak prepared rare and the gauchos did a fantastic job honoring that request. Along those lines, the service was also speedy and the pao de quejo came out piping hot.   I am only docking a star for the lack of swordfish and seared pineapple that is often served at Brazilian BBQ. The salad bar could also use some maintenance and more options such as kale could be included. Other than that, all of the meats were of exceptional quality and cooked exactly to my liking."}
{"text":"Texas de Brazil never fails us when it comes to their service and quality of food.  Their salad bar beats any other restaurants under the same category.  Quality and assortment of meats meet and passes expectations.  Service is great, very attentive.  This past Valentine's day, our waiter Wesley noticed that we were only using splenda from our sugar container.  He took the whole thing and replaced everything with splenda instead of having the assortment.  It is nothing big but not many servers/waiters would go out of their way to do that.  We'd be lucky if we just got a couple packets elsewhere."}
{"text":"So far so good, second time here and food is still just as good. Had a time getting lamb chops but they finally came through. It was worth the wait. Estefania was great! She was very nice and attentive.. Our Anniversary was a success. We are full and all smiles."}
{"text":"Having experienced TDB in Aruba and then again in Orlando...the states still haven't met the standards of the Happy Island of Aruba when it comes to this steakhouse.  With that said, the Pittsburgh location was hands down a better atmosphere than the Orlando restaurant, and the food was great.  If you've never been to another one, the salad bar is fantastic.  If you've been to the TDB in Aruba...it's a little lacking.  I will say that no one really goes to a Brazilian steakhouse for salad...and the meat was excellent.  Even better than the food was our server, who was incredibly knowledgeable about the authentic Brazilian cocktails, the seasonings on the meats, and very attentive to our table.  This would be a great spot for a business dinner, any celebration, and the start to any guys-night-out/bachelor party etc.  It's a meat fest for sure, and I recommend fasting for at least 8 hours so you truly get your monies worth."}
{"text":"Great for a special occasion. Pricey but entertaining. The service was top notch. At least 4 managers continuously came over making sure any and all needs were met. The experience is fun of having a plethora of meats come by your table. If I went back I would just need the salad bar which was full of shrimp, cheese, smoked salmon, sushi, lobster bisque etc.. ( and half the price) Quickly full before the meat even started! Boyfriend loved the endless steaks coming by. Beware of the meat sweats."}
{"text":"I can't think of anything to say, other than \"wow\". This place is amazing. I highly recommend a reservation, at least on the weekend, as the restaurant was very busy. We had a reservation and showed up early for drinks. We checked in with hostess and saddled up to bar. The service at bar and for dinner was amazing. The potatoes au gratin were amazing, as was everything at the buffet. The meats were cooked perfectly and beyond delicious. This is a great place for a date, a celebration, or just a nice dinner."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to celebrate my boyfriends birthday when I visited Texas de Brazil for the first time. When we walked in, there was no warm welcome but just a deep annoyed stare from your hostess.  Our server was quick to get our drinks but the gauchos took forever to get to our table. We had to tell our server that we wanted more meat.  The atmosphere is pretty bright and to be honest we like Fogo de Chao better."}
{"text":"Before my favorite churrascaria opened, I used to go here. Although it's cheaper here and they're open for lunch everyday and they have goat cheese at the salad bar, the service and food quality is marginal.   They have the usual Brazilian BBQ salad bar items such as smoked salmon, lettuce, tomatoes, mushrooms, asparagus, cheeses, olives, salami, beans and rice etc. They give you pao de queijo, fried bananas and mashed potatoes. The meats include chicken, beef, pork, sausage and lamb. I've tried their Key Lime pie, cheesecake, flan and chocolate mousse all of which were just ok.  The gaucho guys seem to take longer going around and when I come to a churrascaria, I come famished...waiting cannot happen. They seem careless too. I'd have blood/ oil/ meat juice drip next to my plate or my arm! Obrigadinha!  Out of the churrascaria's in Vegas. FdC on Flamingo is #1 on my list, TdB is #2, VB in Summerlin is #3...and that P place in Planet Hollywood? Forget it!"}
{"text":"Texas de Brazil has lost my business.  There are very slim chances I will ever return.  The only reason for the 2 stars - is previous visits were ok.  Nothing is phenomenal about this place.  We had 4:15 Saturday reservations...we promptly arrived at 4:05p to not be seated till 4:30.  This is where we started to worry.  More than half the restaurant was empty, 3 hostesses were hanging out chatting at the front of the restaurant and there was at least 6 groups waiting to be seated.  If they had been super busy - I wouldn't have worried about the delay in being seated.    We got seated, picked a few things up at the buffet and began the excitement of \"all the meats!\".  I, personally, was looking forward to Lamb chops.  We get a couple meats, I get a clean plate.  All this time our cards never turned from green.  We were seated right outside where the servers pick up the meat.  They HAVE to walk past us to go in and out.  My Friend and I both have empty - completely empty plates.  After waiting about 5-8 minutes I jokingly say \"I should time how long it takes us to get some meat.\"  I get that the servers probably have routes that they go on to deliver meat - but is ours even on one?    We wait 20 minutes (I started timing).  Kid you not -at least 20 minutes.  (Half the tables in the restaurant are still empty).  We even tried to flag people down.  all the tables around us have plates overflowing with meat.  We have absolutely nothing on our plates.   I track down a manager and go speak to them.  He tells me he just arrived and doesn't know what's going on.  So I go back to our table.  Our waitress comes over - I show her the clock on my phone.  She smirks and laughs to whole time.  I was so frustrated at this point - I had lost my appetite.  The manager who i had previously spoken to comes over and says - we have meat cooking for you.  My friend says - Don't bother - we'd just like the bill as we have both lost our appetites.  He walks into the kitchen/grill and screams \"86 everything for table 18.\"  (That's how close we were).  Walks over to us - who have our credit cards out ready to pay.  And says - \"you can go.  Just get out.\"  Essentially dismissing us.  We were ready to pay.  Never an apology.  Instead we were treated like we did something wrong.    I won't return.  I was so utterly disappointed and shocked by the treatment we had received, it's not worth it.  The manager's treatment was not acceptable.  The laughter from the waitress was not acceptable.  Tread carefully."}
{"text":"After visiting Brasa this place is really close to being better. The salad bar has some nice choices and can be filling if you're not careful. There werec15 meat choices and all were good. I didn't like the BBQ sauce they were using on 2 of the meats. It tasted as if it came straight from the jar.  The Caprihana drink menu is the Bomb!! Very tasty leaning towards sweet. (Thinking they use white sugar instead of raw sugar)  I will visit again!!"}
{"text":"My favorite Brazilian steakhouse in town. My go to spot if I want Brazilian meat. Excellent service. Great to bring your whole family."}
{"text":"If I could give it a zero I would. When we were first greeted at the door we we're told that it would be a 5 minute wait. Which I don't mind what so ever but considering that there were so many open tables I did not understand why we weren't seated. Then finally once we sat at the table we we're sitting there for about 10 minutes and had to ask a random server walking for water.... once we had water brought we then sat there for another 10 minutes and of course had to ask another server if there were any of the people that were going to walk around and bring out any meats. The reply we got TWICE was that there is a large party at the front of the restaurant and that is why it is taking so long for the meats to come back to us. Personally I am a paying customer and believe that myself and anyone who was not apart of that party should have received the same treatment as the ones in the front. After receiving cold meats at least twice I lost my appetite. The manager or waitress discounted the meal to half off... why in the world did we spend 25 on half of a plate that wasn't even eaten??? WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!! I've gone to plenty of Brazilian styled establishments and let's just say this was a complete joke and waste of money. I will never go back and will never recommend anyone to go there!"}
{"text":"This place is everything you could ever hope for from a Brazilian Steak House!! Staff moves fast! Different types of meat selections with mouth watering spices and rubs! Their salad bar is out of this world delicious with tons of variety. The price, $50/person is absolutely worth it! You will not be disappointed! Must try!"}
{"text":"The gauchos spent the majority of time at the center of the restaurant and infrequently visited the perimeter tables."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE.  If I could give this place no stars whatsoever, then I would. (1) Our waitress was slow and forgetful. They were either understaffed or overbooked but neither is a good excuse for poor service. (2) My husband found a women's hair in his salad bar items and/or baked into the cheese biscuit, which we *might* have overlooked BUT... (3) A mouse was running in and out of the wine cellar area behind us and into the restaurant - a mere 20 feet away from the kitchen.   As if that wasn't bad enough, the staff and manager's reactions were horrifying: First, they did not seem to care or mind that a rodent was running loose. It was almost as if they knew about the problem before it happened. (2) I had to actually persuade the manager to take care of our bill. Unfortunately, his solution was to only slightly discount our meal rather than completely comping it. We're not the type of couple to ever ask for freebies - I even offered to pay for the wine, hoping to suggest that we were not inclined to pay for a meal after such a horrifying experience. To make matters worse, we saw the hair and the mouse after finishing eating. Had we seen it before gorging on food, we would have simply finished our wine and left. What an awful feeling to realize after ingesting an entire meal that your food was prepared in wholly unsanitary conditions - not to mention the kick in the face of shelling out $100+ after everything that happened.   This was a completely unacceptable meal experience. Before this all happened, we discussed possibly going back and/or taking friends or family but we will NEVER step foot in there again. Disgusting.  **SINCE WRITING THIS REVIEW, THE ALLEGHENY HEALTH DEPARTMENT DID AN INSPECTION: http://hdas01.achd.net/reports/rwservlet?food_rep_insp&P_ENCOUNTER=201401230037  **Texas De Brazil corporate office have been unresponsive."}
{"text":"I went to the Texas De Brazil today,  I have to say I didn't think it was as good as the Texas De Brazil in Aruba.  So I was a little disappointed,  I didn't like how close the tables were to each other, it felt crowded.  When I  got up to walk to the salad bar or restroom I was bumping into people.  The food at the salad bar wasn't bad.  I just think for the price we paid there should have been more selections.  We ate there at 5:45 , its probably better to eat there later,  when we were at the salad bar there were a lot of people around it, the line was moving really slow. The meat selection was okay, but I think they gave really small pieces compared to what I remember in Aruba.   The deserts were really good. The waiter we had was slow it seemed like we waited along time for things, because they said they were busy,  restaurants always give that excuse. I don't know if I'll go back there, I feel for me its not worth the price since I don't eat that much."}
{"text":"I was in town last week and as a first timer I didn't know what to expect. From the moment we walked In to the second we left everyone was super friendly. The house steak was my very favorite but they had all kinds of meat floating around the room. Even when we seem to be having a great time we were constantly asked if we needed help. A big thanks to all their staff. Also, carrot cake was amazing."}
{"text":"BJ may not be my Daddy, but I took him to Texas De Brazil for Father's Day anyway!  We have dined at locations in Florida and Illinois, so we knew exactly what to expect from Texas De Brazil.  But what we didn't expect was the \"Burghin-ization\" of this chain.  At other locations, you are greeted at an elegant and serene hostess stand away from the dining room.  In Da Burgh, it's more like walking into a high school gymnasium.  We had to shout at the hostess so she could hear our names.  The acoustics are horrendous.  The beautiful lighting fixtures are lost in the din of the ugly black ceiling.  The tables are helter skelter.  As another diner mentions, you can't go to the ladies room without having to knock at least 3 people over.    The elegant salad bar topped with their signature massive floral arrangement seems surrounded by the homeless lining up for their last meal.  Even the gauchos are different here.  Some of them are a wee bit timid, rather then proudly strutting around to show their meat. Maybe they will get of the hang of it.  Maybe not.  Where are the elegant white table linens?  Where is the incredible service?  To our dear servers, I am sure you are exhausted.  But please don't complain to me about how hard to you have to work and how much your feet hurt.  I am here to celebrate!  Only in Pittsburgh.  Now if you can just get by all that.....  We loved dining here.  Even with the lack of ambiance and stiff service, the food is still the number one star.  The salad and hot food bar is amazing.  The lobster bisque is delicious.  The salads are incredible.  And the Brazilian potato salad and marinated veggies are so good.  I am in love with the  pineapple carpaccio.  We loved adding the mushrooms with our beef.  And I am not sure why, but every meat tastes extraordinary at TDB.  Love the anticipation of waiting to see what yummy meat will show up our table next.  When we weren't seeing the bacon wrapped filet, we had to ask for it.  And we had to ask a second time.  So, don't be timid about asking for anything in particular.  For dessert, not included, we shared an incredible slice of pecan pie a la mode.  Sweet ending to an incredible meal.  Just a couple of helpful tips.  Try not to eat anything on the day of your visit.  Maybe even the evening before.  It would be a shame to not be able to try all of the TDB offerings.  And be sure to visit their web site and sign up for their E-club.  I see a free birthday and anniversary meal in your future."}
{"text":"For our two year anniversary (that's like five in hetero years) we wanted to do something different and special. Originally we wanted to try the Columbian Spot, but every time we've tried, they've been closed. So, having had experience with the Green Forest Cafe in Penn Hills, the other Brazilian meatery in town, we decided to go for the meat at the new place we'd not tried.  We walked in, and my better half had made the reservations and they seemed to know ALL about us. Took to our seat where our very sweet server, a gal from the Ukraine, gave us the run down on how it all worked (pretty much exactly like Green Forest) explained a few specialties and took our drink orders.  The space is a very nice upscale and ENORMOUS cavern. Quite elegant for 'da burgh' I have to say. Giant colorful artificial floral explosions above all of the food stations, beneath extremely high industrial ceilings, with a visible wine 'cellar' that looks more like a wine library with bottles from floor to ceiling, requiring the rolling ladder to get to many of them.  There is an extensive buffet area with salads, appetizers, sushi and antipasta, and a hot bar of beans and rice and other goods. For their soup, they offered a delicious lobster bisque. My better half sampled a LITTLE of the salad goods, but I avoided it all except the bisque. I was there for my favorite stuff-myself-with-no-carbs meal...all the meat I could eat.  On your table is a little disc, like a coaster. One side red, one side green.  And green means...GO!  As soon as you flip the disc to green, a small army of beautiful ethnic men come to your table with meat on a stick that they carve off fresh from the grille. Chicken, lamb, beef, pork, sausage...and to your tastes. Before the meal begins, the server asks how you prefer your meat cooked, or specifically, 'desired temperature'. If you say medium rare, that is the specific server that comes to your table. The one serving the medium rare.  It keeps coming, and every mouthful sinfully delicious. Suddenly, there are a few too many pieces on the plate...  And red means...STOP. Take a break, chew, clean off your plate.  And green means GO again!  The server keeps up with you, taking care of the beverages, and bringing little extras to the table, like some kind of little dough balls and garlic mashed potatoes (though I know this is intended to fill you up so that you won't 'green GO' as much. We're hip to that jive, and didn't eat the carbs.)  The manager comes to the table and makes sure that everything is going well.   Because it was our anniversary, they have us free cake, a discount, and a gift certificate for $25 toward our next visit.  Truly, we had a very special and fulfilling evening. The food was stellar. The meat servers were as delicious to look at as the meat was to eat (a huge welcome change from the sloppy Pittsburgher view). The rest of the staff was efficient, friendly and helpful. All wrapped up in an elegant atmosphere.  The only reason for the missing fifth star is because though it was a terrific evening and meal, it was way too expensive to go on a regular basis. The cost for two was over $120, and I didn't hear a Brooklyn accent the entire night. It's truly a 'special occasion' type of place.  The shocker was...this was a Monday night in Pittsburgh at a VERY expensive and ENORMOUS restaurant. And it was absolutely packed!  Thank you Texas de Brazil for giving us a special evening for our special event."}
{"text":"Our entire experience was amazing , the meat so tender and juicy . Staff was exceptional . We will be back for sure . Yes it's a little on the pricey side but for those cuts of meat it's worth it !"}
{"text":"Absolutely awful experience at this place.   The staff was so rude and not helpful at all.   All of the steak they served us was medium rare even though we specified that we prefer medium well, considering you're a steakhouse we were pretty upset that you couldn't deliver.  This place is so overpriced for what you get our bill was over 130 dollars for our dinner and 2 drinks.   Do NOT go here just save your money it's terrible"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Ive passed this place a million times and me and my date decided to stop in for an evening out. I thought this was just a steak house but its actually a salad buffet and they bring a huge assortment of meat to your table. The atmosphere is amazing, the salad buffet is clean, the meet is absolutely delicious! Service was amazing too.  Unfortunately there is no menu so I wasnt prepared for the bill that came. $50/person. Sodas are $4/each. Alcoholic drinks are outrageous. I almost fell out of my seat when the bill came... but I was with a hot 22 year old blond so I had to keep my cool.  For a special night out or business dinner this place is a must."}
{"text":"I went out tonight for my sister and cousins bday. 1st time at Texas De Brazil! I haven't had really good service going out in general  in a while , but tonight was Amazing our server Stephen was Awesome & Amazing! He made sure it was perfect if it wasn't right! My drink suggestion was delsih! I had the the strawberry caipirinha  cocktail! The atmosphere was cool! The salad bar was delsih! & of course the meats were delsih my fav was the garlic sirloin and the flank steak! But most all very tasty! It was worth every penny!  I had a great time! Will go back again! :)"}
{"text":"Be ready to spend an arm and a leg lol but trust me it will be worth every penny. Thanks to the email blast, if you buy a gift card for $100 you get an extra $25. I came here on a Sunday night but made an rsvp a week early because some of my coworkers were telling me, it's a nightmare trying to get a table the day of. Plan ahead everyone!  I love love love this restaurant. To be honest I can just come here for their lobster bisque and the cheese bread. It's so delicious. The system here is pretty simple. You have a coaster looking thing on your table. Flip it to the color GREEN and all the workers start coming to you asking you if you would like the type of meat they are serving.  They had an numerous selection of meat such as Lamb chops, chicken, filet mignon, bacon wrapped filet mignon, sausages and many more. After trying everything and your full, simply flip your card over to the color RED which indicates to stop and the workers will not offer you any more meats.  The salad bar area is pretty yummy as well. I love the salad, shrimp,  jasmine white rice, sushi & asparagus. The best part of all this is... IT'S ALL YOU CAN EAT!  I recommend this restaurant! Just be ready to eat!!!! Trust me, your going to want to taste everything \"twice\""}
{"text":"This was my first time dining in this establishment when I was in vegas. The interior of the restaurant was breathtaking and the salad bar presentation looked elegant. We did the AYCE lunch special where servers are coming around serving different types of meat on sticks and cut the pieces right in front of your eyes. The meat was flavorful and good job on preparing the lamb; there was no game aftertaste which I dislike! The salad bar had a good selection along with dipping sauces, soups, and appetizers. One thing was a bit disappointing was the service. Our server did a good job in checking up on us but he always look grumpy and felt annoyed when we requested for something (maybe having a bad day?)."}
{"text":"Another visit here with family and friends and another 5 star experience.  Excellent atmosphere and patrons.  Looking for Peter (Excellent waiter) but was already assigned to Addam.  Addam was great.  Dining out with me  includes getting to know the waiter.  Like with  Peter we found that Addam is another fellow No Californian speaking Brazilian Portuguese.  Joking around throughout the 3 hours there makes it a very enjoyable dinner.  Keep those drinks coming as I warned my wife going to dollar dance and we'll get him in with a percentage.   As he asked me to critique the flan since i had flan Cuba, Venezuela, Colombia, Spain I told him was a little firmer than the others but I still liked it.  He said how about the carmelize raw sugar from Brazil, my reply bring out the Brazilian dancers and that'll really sweeten the dessert.  He and his other female co-workers just started busting up. Peter came by chat a bit and it's like a big family atmosphere here. Yes, the food is 5+ stars, service is 5+ also but to get that + it's the staff and all of them throughout is 10+."}
{"text":"Great buffet and great food. It's pricey but it's well worth it. You won't leave hungry at all!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat by far. Why pay 50$ for one steak when i can have a plethora of meats. 5 stars must try."}
{"text":"It's ok, but not for that price. The meats are rather salty and the buffet is good but not great. The lobster bisque is terrible. It's basically a cream of tomato with lobster flavouring. The gratin potatoes were actually deep fried and covered in a strange white sauce instead of baked. The service was ok but twice the staff was rude to my son for no apparent reason dive he was behaving. So I guess it's not child friendly."}
{"text":"We just went there last night,everything there was so good!If you gonna visit Vegas,you definitely have to come here~Love this place!"}
{"text":"Lots of food. Lots and lots and lots of food. This isn't your average buffet dinner, this is where you go to get stuffed. I had been to a Brazillian bbq out in orlando a few years back so I knew these things existed and the charm of the place.  With their restaurant week deal, I could not pass up on the opportunity (it was 35 plus tax and tip for unlimited salad bar/meats and a choice of dessert) - still expensive but definitely better than the regular price.  The salad bar was good, I would have expected a little more variety but oh well. The meats were delicious. I loved the leg of lamb and the lamb chops. The brazilian sausage was another good piece of meat as well. The pecan pie hit the spot at the end.  I am not lying when I say I did not eat anything until dinner the next day. I stuffed myself. It was a great experience (but being frugal and a grad student, I don't think I could go here often) - nonetheless, I will be back to devour some glorious food.  (We visited the bar but it seemed a bit overpriced for our taste so we didn't really get anything)  The servers and the people walking around with the skewers were very cordial as well and answered any questions quickly."}
{"text":"This is absolutely hands down the best place on Earth to treat yourself to a high quality meal. The meats are to die for, especially the bacon wrapped filet mignon. The lobster bisque is out of this world. I can't leave without eating at least two bowls of it. Be sure to sign up for their email club to receive discounts."}
{"text":"Richard is the best waiter ever. He went out of his way to show me and my girl the ins and outs. If your staff was full of Richards, your business would boom even more. Kudos to Richard and Texas de Brazil."}
{"text":"I think that any negative review has not dined at a Brazilian Steakhouse previously.   Yes, the meat is salty in most cases- that's how it's supposed to be. It's cooked in rock salt.  Yes, the meat comes quickly if you have your chip on \"green\". You are informed of that upon sitting, and encouraged to take your time.  Last night we had an excellent experience at Texas de Brazil. I was impressed by the choices on the salad bar- and had to fight myself not to eat all of it so I would have room for all 'da meats!!  Our server, Alex, was phenomenal and added to a really nice night. He was knowledgable about the two signature drinks we had and even met me at the salad bar to make sure everything was going well.  It was a packed house on a Friday night, but a manager stopped by to make sure everything was up to par. Good gesture.   This is what you would consider a \"dining experience\". I can understand how some would call it rushed (if the chip is green, I never felt rushed otherwise) or salty, but that's part of this Brazilian ambience. Take it or leave it.  It's a little pricey, but I don't consider it over priced. We had two dinners, four drinks (total), and dessert and it was about $140. I've spent WAY more than that at other steakhouses. We were there for a special occasion, so I didn't mind paying extra."}
{"text":"Service ... Perfect, Food... Perfect, Ambiance... Perfect.   I was completely blown away by Texas de Brazil! The service from the moment we sat down was impeccable. The caipirinhas were ok, but not as good as Seviche- for my taste palate. However, the food is what took this restaurant to a perfect score in my opinion.  The salad/cold bar is packed with the good stuff; mushrooms, potato salad, regular salad, salmon (which is amazing), asparagus, tabouleh, and the list goes on.   The best part of the meal was all the meat. I'm not a huge meat eater in everyday life, but if you come here - be prepared for a protein overload (in a good way). The chicken selections were okay, but my favorites were the lamb chops, steak selections, and BBQ pork ribs. Yes... I had them ALL! They also have leg of lamb, parmesan chicken, bacon wrapped chicken, filet mignon, bacon wrapped chicken, flank steak, beef ribs, sausage, parmesan pork, etc,. Plus- they bring mashed potatoes, bread, and fried bananas to the table.   I would recommend saving your appetite for Texas de Brazil in order to try everything your heart desires.   I will be back soon, and suggest this restaurant to everyone I know!"}
{"text":"Been here once before and then recently went for dinner and I enjoyed everything I got. The wait for dinner was about an hour but it wasn't a big deal so just walked around town square for a bit to kill time. So if your in a rush make reservations. I love the salad bar and I think that was the best part for me. So many choices including soups like the lobster bisque which is a must try, olives, cheeses, cured meats, mushrooms and so much more. The meat choices were endless and I loved the top sirloin and everything that was bacon wrapped! Try everything that comes around even if you think your full. The service was good and the server even got us the bananas with condensed milk which wasn't on the menu and it was addicting. The bread with the cheese is also a must try but try not to get full on that."}
{"text":"My girlfriend's sister was visiting us so we wanted to treat her to a hearty meal before she jumped on a 20 hour train ride to Minneapolis.     The meats were cooked rare and I told them I wanted it well done. The servers going around the dining area were polite but never seemed to have any meat cooked well done. They told me they would come back but they never did.    Our server, forgot his name, but he looked like Benjamin from the movie \"The Sandlot\".  He was very thorough in his explanation of how the dining experience was going to go as far as foods and what meats would be offered.  We opted for a bottle of wine and we attempted to order five or six bottles of wine but each time our server came back to us to tell us it was sold out.  He then said something to the lines of \"this one is very similar for ONLY $35 more\".  WTF, ONLY $35 more, C'mon, so we decided to skip having wine.    The only reason for three instead of five stars was the issues with the wine and the lack of well-done meat.  Otherwise, great experience & we will probably be back on a special occasion like when we have some out of town guests."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I attended dinner here last night and it was simply amazing! We called ahead to make reservations and were promptly/cheerfully greeted and seated. The server explained to us how everything worked and sent us over to the 50 item salad bar. It's definitely a salad bar but really so much more! They've got so many different fresh cheese and cold/warm salads to choose from.  After we finished the salad portion, they brought over the fried plantains which was explained to be the palate cleanser between meats (it really did work, so I definitely recommend utilizing this- they will bring more if you run out!) When you flip your card to green, the men carrying around the meat will stop at your table and carve you off a slice. Flip your card to red and they stop doing it until you're ready to keep eating.   We also had the red sangria, which was good (huge pitcher) but I'm not sure if it's something we'd do again because it added $40 to our bill and wasn't as extravagant as the rest of the meal.   We finished with a slice of Brazilian Cheese Cake and their Chocolate Ganache cake - which as a professional baker, this was arguably the most important part to me... and it knocked our socks off! I would 10 out of 10 highly recommend! Just make sure you're ready to treat yourself as our total bill come out to $155 before tip."}
{"text":"Honestly one of the best places to eat in Las Vegas. The food is always amazing. The salad bar is one of the best, and the service is never unsatisfactory. Top of the line customer service and food. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"We've eaten at three different Brazilian steakhouse. Texas de Brazil is the best, especially for the price ($49.99, kids 6-12 $24.99), which was a bit less than the last churrascaria we tried. The meat was tender, juicy, and flavorful. By far the best meat of any churrascaria. The salad bar had excellent cheese, meats, vegetables, soups, and salads as expected. The popover-like rolls and plantains were good. The only disappointment were the mashed potatoes. Service was very good, and the servers passed as soon as we turned over our cards and asked if we wanted a specific meat. It's impressive when service is good when we opt to not order beverages."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! I would highly recommend this place. If you go Try the bacon wrapped filet mignon."}
{"text":"I brought my boyfriend here for his birthday, and we enjoyed it so much that I brought my family back a month later.  I'm not a huge meat-eater, so I liked that they had a salad bar with a ton of options (I'm a cheese and veggie person so I loved everything I tried).  I still appreciated their meat selection...the picanha was my favorite!  The fried banana sides were refilled pretty quickly both visits, which was all that was really important to me, so I thought the service was great.  The only things that I didn't really like was that I had to navigate my way through a maze of tables to get to the salad bar, so coming back with plates of food made me a little nervous that I might drop something, and our table was a too cramped for 4 people, especially with so many sides going around.  I would still eat here again for sure though!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite AYCE meat restaurant. discovered this chain while on the east coast, and was happy it came to Las Vegas. we don't eat that much meat at home, so I think we get our fair share when we dine here. who can resist trying all of the meats? although, bacon wrapped chicken isn't that special to me, so I usually bypass that skewer. the meats are cooked to all wellness levels, although the picahna which is the house special, usually comes out med rare. I don't like it dripping blood, so I tell the server I like it medium and he will come back with medium. supposedly there are 17 kinds of meats, I am not sure I've seen all 17, but we have our favorites. picahna, garlic sirloin, flank steak, bacon wrapped filet mignon, lamb chops that tops our lists, oh and the sausage! always have to have one of those!  There is a huge salad bar that you could easily fill up on, and if you aren't a meat eater, it will be your meal. A friend who dined with us  once said, that only amateurs fill their plates with salad, because you will have no room for meat.  it's true, but who can resist? I love the bacon pieces they have on the bar. I'll usually get some romaine with blue cheese dressing and bacon pieces. mind you, they aren't bits! I also like to eat them with the cheese bread that comes on the table with mashed potatoes and fried bananas. those fried bananas are another favorite.  we sometimes forgo dessert for another plate of bananas. on the occasion that we can get a dessert for free, we usually get creme brulee  (hubby) key lime (me) and cheesecake or bananas foster pie just depends on the mood.  The best deal about this place used to be the BOGO if you had a birthday or anniversary.  you'd have to sign up for the eclub. but they stopped doing that for couple years now  now they have the dining card for 12 half price meals for $59.99. money goes to charity and they usually come out in March and you have until September to use it up. We've gotten one for the last few years and it's such a great deal. we always say maybe we need to buy 2, but that never happens because sometimes we aren't home for the summer months at a time, and so we end up having to eat there once a week, which is ALOT of meat!"}
{"text":"First time experience and it was good. I was highly impressed with there choices at the salad bar. So many choices and it was all very good. The meat choices were all good on an average. Some I didn't care for and some were good. The only choice that stood out for me was the garlic sirloin, which is odd for the cut of meat and what I usually prefer. This is my first experience at a Brazilian steakhouse so I have no comparisons, but the meat quality was average to good nothing special. I definitely will be bringing others back here every once in a while.  The only negative thing I can really say is the whole red/green card thing was a joke. They didn't follow that one bit and started asking us for meat as soon as we sat down eating our salads. it seemed like they ignored that and just brought us whatever meat based of the table next to us and what they were eating. It made it a little hard to enjoy when they showed up with 4 cuts of meat at once and nothing for 5  minutes. They could of done a better job a timing and spacing it out. It was like all or nothing it seemed. Overall that wouldn't prevent me from coming back."}
{"text":"I would totally recommend this place if you are a meat lover. Its very nice inside good for family , friends , or a date. Its kind of dark inside if you like that. The employees are wonderful and very helpful . It was my moms birthday and they asked me for the occasion and i told them and they went ahead and told my server so they can sing her happy bday without me even asking them for it. It was a nice surprise . The meats are so good  and the salad bar is interesting. If you go there for the meat don't over do the salads because you wont have any more room left to eat lol. :) Im going to go there with my husband for a date its a nice place. Oh and wine! They have great wine."}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to trying this place and my husband took us there for our anniversary!  I am so impressed!! We had reservations and were seated immediately. Our server could not have been more attentive! He recommended some things, he gave us little hints, & cleared used plates immediately to give us more room.  To begin with, OMG the salad bar! I've never seen one with that many options. I tried some new things like hearts of palm and sushi.  I tried real hard not to fill my plate! The tabouli was to die for! It was the best I've ever had. There were rolls on the table (tiny like cream puff size and tasted like flaky croissants) and he brought mashed potatoes (yum) and fried bananas that tasted like they had cinnamon on them. Delicious! And then comes the MEAT!  I can't say enough about the meat and how many options there were and how delicious it was and how perfectly it was served and how I wished I had three or four stomachs so I could keep eating. I felt bad when I got full!  And even though I was full to capacity, I ordered coffee and dessert.  I waddled out of there like a beached whale. I am already looking forward to our next visit which, I am sure, we will save for another special occasion!"}
{"text":"I was first impressed when I walked in the door. I didn't really know what to expect from this place- boyfriend picked it so I didn't have a chance to Yelp-stalk it like I normally would.  :-)  The ambience and décor in the restaurant were very chic. It was comfortable and inviting, although there are high, industrial ceilings and glass walls throughout. Had an edge of luxe without being pretentious.  We were greeted immediately on a quiet Tuesday by a hostess with too many questions. I was a little put off by that- I don't want to give you my name I just want to sit down! But I understand.  Server stopped by as soon as we sat down and explained the menu, process and recommended some drinks. Service was very attentive and friendly- dirty plates cleared immediately, drinks refilled promptly.  The cold foods bar was very impressive to me! I loved all the options of meats, cheeses, salads, veggies. All things you wouldn't find at a typical salad bar. I can't even call this a salad bar. It was like a heaven for me. I wasn't very impressed with the hot sides- rice, beans, mushrooms, soup and au gratin potato, I believe?  I know this place is geared towards meateaters, but I would have really loved a side of broccoli or carrot or other hot vegetable.  The meat was fantastic. Everything they brought was expertly prepared. The lamb.... Oh the lamb! The food was coming at a comfortable pace and I was happy with the variety. However, I just don't have the room in my tummy for a place like this. I was even careful not to fill up on sides, but I really could not eat as much of the meat as I wanted. As a result of this, I felt like the price was not a very good value for me. For my bf who ate ONLY served meat and has a voracious appetite- may have been a different story.  It's a fun experience and you should check it out at least once!"}
{"text":"First time here and everything was perfect! Jake our server showed great customer service and friendliness. We we'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place two times. Very expensive and not good at all. Very bad service both times. I have eaten at there other restaurants around the country they where much better."}
{"text":"Really good food. Call ahead to make reservations   I almost took one star away because they charge for drink refills I think that's really stupid especially when you have a big group I am not happy paying almost thirty bucks on soda when I am paying fifty to sixty bucks per person  come on it actually benefits the business because you get full on soda rather than the expensive meat    If you are staying in Vegas and have a car drive yourself otherwise it's an expensive cab ride   If you are a government employee like a police officer or military maybe firemen they give  a big discount so make sure you take your ID   The service was excellent   The place is very clean   And the food is the awesome  they have  a yelp deal or discount so make sure you use that too"}
{"text":"I was in meat heaven!!!! Carnivore through and through!!! Texas de Brazil is one of my favorite places to go.... Amazing side dishes that you can choose from, Brazilian cheese bread that's so addicting! And the best part men coming around to your tables with all types of meat on what are large skewers (looks kinda like a sword) that they slice for you at your table!!! My favorites are the lamb chops and they're specialty top sirloin!!! AHHHMAZING!!!!!   Our server Amanda Newman was wonderful!!! She was so accommodating and friendly to both my friend and I... I give her 10 stars for her EXCELLENT customer service!!! We spoke highly of her to her manager. I always enjoy coming here... Next time we're gonna ask to sit in her section... From the hostesses to our server, and the men serving the meat, I must say that I really enjoyed our dinner tonight!!! I know it says that this was my first time checking in here but I've been here dozens of times... Always a great place to go!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is outstanding!! Come with an appetite! All different choices of meat and veggies. The servers are great!  Be prepared to wait to get a table.   That's why I did not give 5 stars.  We had a large party (18) and advanced reservations.  We waited about 40min to get our table.  We couldn't sit at the bar- for it was too small. Also, for $50pp- should include a small dessert."}
{"text":"We love Texas De Brazil! Their service and food are just awesome! Everything is done first class. Well worth your money. Be sure to request Stacy as your server. She is the absolute best!"}
{"text":"The service was just perfect. I had just the salad bar and it was a vegetarian's dream. ! We went for my husbands birthday and he was in meat Heaven ...  We love this place. Let me say again...service was perfect !!! Make sure to sign up online for a Birthday surprise."}
{"text":"Came here on Easter Sunday to celebrate starting a new job.  Despite the crowd, we were seated very quickly and the service was just as attentive.  Food was great, and atmosphere was equally pleasant.  Would definitely come back and definitely recommend to others."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I celebrated here for our 2 year anniversary, and it was amazing.  The price was not low, but that's only because you are paying for quality service and quality food. The meat selections were all delicious, and the salad bar was incredible. Crab rolls, asparagus, imported cheeses, salmon, hand made soups and sauces, and more. The service was very attentive, and we did not wait for refills as they were always on top of it. I will definitely be going there again, and hopefully soon."}
{"text":"First off I was very satisfied with my dinner( party of 7)but unfortunately for my mom and cousin weren't able to enjoy the satisfaction that I did. They basically paid $50 each for a open salad bar every time they had asked for well done they kept getting told that they'd be right back. 2 hours in and 3 plates of grape salad later still no meat for them. Our waitress was very attentive for as much as she can do in her position but unfortunately it wasn't enough to save their dinner. ?"}
{"text":"Great food!  Great service!  Just wish I could eat as much as I used to in my twenties!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The filet and bacon is always phenomenal. The flank, top sirloin, and beef rib were also on point last night! Every person/guest I bring here always leaves with a smile and waddles out the door (meat drunk). Service is always great too. Although last night there were no hearts of palm, which is one of my favorites. I hope they didn't stop serving it."}
{"text":"Our reservations were for 5 PM on Saturday.  Since it was Father's Day weekend it was packed. I opted for the salad bar and the rest of my party went for the full menu.  The salad bar was great.  They had a shrimp dish and a fish dish that was very satisfying. Smoked salmon was very popular. There must've been more than 20 different vegetable items on the salad bar. Although it was packed, the service was very attentive. Definitely worth coming back."}
{"text":"Quality. Service. Taste. And did I mention all the food you can stomach?? Everything about our experience at Texas de Brazil was aces except the table/room I reserved. Let me explain...  We were gonna be in town for several days for a bachelor party and I had called to reserve a table for 10. I signed up for their online newsletter and it alerted me to them having private rooms available. I inquired about that and Natasha said we could have that room for our party as it was not reserved yet. I called about 2 months prior to our weekend in Vegas. I even asked Natasha if the room would be able to handle a couple of more people as our party number might fluctuate closer to the date. She assured me that the room is spacious enough to hold up to 50 and it was all ours. Awesome! Well, the weekend came around and on the day of our dinner reservation I got a call to confirm. I called back and did so. No word of any issues, so I didnt worry... Problem was when I got there, I was told by the hostess and later by the manager that the private room wasnt available as it had been booked already but Natasha wasnt aware. Hmmm... Really?? Now you tell me?... Sounds fishy. Sounds like you booked a bigger party in that room and bumped us. I wasnt told that but I'm not a fool. All they needed to do was ask me and I wouldve given up that room to the bigger party. No problem. Instead I was given a lame excuse that I wasnt buying. A nice establishment like this, and they dont have all their reservations synched?? C'mon now! Anyways, that was not cool... And I had to tell the story. The manager was apologetic and promised to give us a table kind of off to the side and we kinda did. It was whatever by then...We were hungry and we were seated.  The food was great. All the cuts of meat we had were delicious. The various cuts of beef, chicken & pork were great. I really liked the bacon wrapped filet.The brazilian sausage was delish. Pork ribs I missed out on but I heard they were great. Bacon wrapped chicken was also good. Parmesan crusted pork loin was tasty. Flank steak was delicious.The herb-marinated pork loin was also good. Meat wasted for sure. The salad and sides bar was good. I liked the charcuterie. The prosciutto was good with bread and cheese. The string beans and garlic mash was great. But the true star was the LOBSTER BISQUE. I had heard about this greatness for a while and it lived up to the hype. So good. You will want to have bowl and bowls of it. Yumm.  Service was attentive. They were always around offering us the different cuts of beef, clearing our dishes and refilling our drinks. The only issue was with our reservation. Had to deduct a star for that. I considered deducting more but the experience otherwise was great. Like I said, I signed up for their online newsletter and timing was with us as I got an email giving parties of up to 10 to be given $10 off each person making it $40 instead of $50 for dinner. (Mon-Thurs). Cool beans. We were there on a Thursday night so it was perfect. I suggest signing up.   I plan on eating there again the next time we're in town. I will make reservations again. I hope that aspect is far improved on the next trip. Lobster bisque!!"}
{"text":"Will not be returning! Food was extremely salty. It was definitely not worth the price."}
{"text":"Wow. This place is a find! The staff is beyond polite and friendly. We have never been to a place like this and had no idea what to expect. At first we think ugly maybe we stepped into too fancy of a joint, but quickly were made welcome, even with a three yr old. Soooo many choices in the not so salad bar, super tasty stuff! The waiters come around and just cut meat onto your plate and you decide when you've had enough. My favorite was the flank steak, my husband really liked the house special sirloin and the sausage best, and our older son was a big fan of the Parmesan chicken. Our three yr old pretty much just snacked on pineapple and cheese. This place makes me wish I had a bigger stomach because there is just so much to enjoy. We will definitely be back next time we're on vacation."}
{"text":"This is our go to place for birthdays, anniversaries, and just because he loves me.  The salad bar has an amazing variety of delicious foods.  The meat selections are awesome.  It is always busy. Even with reservations. Still totally worth it."}
{"text":"Via Brasil Steakhouse has this place beat, by far, in my opinion! I can't say I enjoyed anything. They claim to have 15 different meats and I experienced 8. They have a bigger salad bar but that's it. It took forever to get meat and when they brought it by they piled it on my plate. By the time I ate one cut the othe cuts were cold. When I asked for one cut at a time they took forever to come back by. I guess they could blame it on the crowd but it really was due to being under staffed. All in all they did not make my favorites list and I'll probably never eat here again. $200 later and I'm still hungry. Hype?"}
{"text":"Meat overload.  Stick with the filet and top sirloin, they are the  tastiest cuts walking around.  Most of the other cuts are filler meats and are for the most part mediocre.   The salad bar is large and a bit haphazard in the item selection.  I did not try any of the soups as the reason you are here is MEAT!    The sides brought table side are good but again, avoid them and stick with the meats.     The place is a bit pricy at 50 bucks a person for dinner and 3 bucks for a 8 oz bottle of soda.   They have some killer looking desserts but if did this place right, you will be in a meat coma before they show you the sweets.    Not really my kind of place so I am giving it three stars.   I would rather go to a good steakhouse rather than getting small cuts delivered when you flag down a server."}
{"text":"This location is the worst I have been to! Messed up my reservation time! Then the customer service is very blah...no personality and some workers look very confused of their surroundings lets hope the food will offset the horrible beginning.  I will update this post for now it get 1 star!"}
{"text":"Thank you for your response. I would rather not single out the waiter, maybe you could discuss this topic in your next staff meeting so the entire staff is made aware of this issue."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars I would.  Uhhh .. A Brazilian steak house with a splash of Texas style BBQ and flavor.  If I was a female my panties would be soaked right now... The ambience is super nice.  You are surrounded by a lot of people because the place isn't super big and its usually always busy especially for dinner!  I always make a reservation a day in advance to make sure I get seated with in 5 minutes.  The meat is well prepared, marinated, served, and of course eaten.  I've been here like 10 times in my lifetime!  The salad bar ha some great selections.  I always get the asparagus, and green beans.  For you sick bastards that eat sushi there is a couple sushi selections for you.  The wine list is pretty nice.  I usually get the sangria because it sneaks up on you!   I didn't know this but they do give a little discount for military (On the food).  The waitress that saw me and my date was awesome.  Wish I remembered her name but she noticed my military ID when I showed it and she told me she'd adjust my check.  You're going to spend $50.00 a plate here so make sure you eat all you can."}
{"text":"This is just a all you can meat paradise ! I wish my stomach was tripled in size so i can just eat so much steak. I came in here on a Sunday night at around 4, and it wasn't busy at that time. Once it started hitting at 5 pm it began to be super busy. Our waiter \"Richard\" was very nice and helpful. I appreciated his enthusiasm working for this company.   This awesome meat factory is located on the outskirts of Town square. Plenty of parking, and the building is huge to not miss it. The inside can get a little crowded around the salad bar. I believe the salad bar you can just pay to eat there which i don't mind. So you have so many waiters walking around with meat either they serve you or skip you depending on your card.   Now for the food, my favorite part of the salad bar was the mint sauce for my steak and all the vegetables they offer. I keep going back for more ! I only eat mostly all the beef steak options. The flank steak was my favorite and ribeye steak. I give everything a 5/5 rating !!! The price is worth it, than eating at those fancy buffets at the strip. Im definitely coming back, no matter what the occasion is."}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant a dozen times and loved it. This was our first visit to the Westlake location. It will unfortunately be a long time before we return. Our server Melissa was incredible. The cooks could not figure out how to serve the meat. Everything they brought out was so well done it was like eating a puck and after multiple complaints they brought out meat not at all well done. It wasn't even cooked in the slightest. I mean it was rarer than rare."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonite. This place is amazing if you like to eat meat....which I definitely do!!  Our server, Cameron, was excellent. There are enough lengthy reviews here, so I won't add another  super lengthy one. Bottom line , this place lives up to it's great reviews. I will be back again. Oh yeah the cheesecake was nothing less than amazing!"}
{"text":"We used to frequent this place quite a bit, but no longer do so for several reasons:  First let me say the food is good. Meats are cooked to perfection and the salad bar is extensive and refreshing. The salads, cheeses, and lobster bisque are all of high quality, and seasoned perfectly.   However, the last time we went to Texas de Brazil I was greeted by a rude hostess who had no interest in accommodating a simple request (a table on the side of the Restaraunt so my children did not interrupt anyone else's meal). So when the waiter came around, I asked to be moved and the gracious waitstaff accommodated us. I simply want to be courteous to other diners and not interrupt someone else's good time if my children get restless.  The food was excellent, and so was the service. Our waiter was attentive and provided every special request of meat that we asked for. I was not expecting what came next...  Prices: I was expecting $45 a plate for adults, $5 for my 10 year old, and no charge for my 6 and 2 year olds, just as the snotty hostess told us. What I got when I looked at the receipt was $50 a plate for the adults, $25 for my 10 year old, and $5 each for my 6 and 2 year olds. That is not including drinks or dessert. I asked the waiter why the tab was so off, and he stated the prices had been raised. I was not advised of this, and the hostess specifically gave me different numbers.   I paid and left. I didn't even want to both with speaking to management because I was so disgusted with the hostesses attitude and lack of knowledge which cost me an additional $45. The food is good. The overall experience is good, but Fogo de Chao gets an additional 2 stars for at least having competent, professional, and POLITE staff."}
{"text":"My husband and I, ate here for the first time! And let me tell you!! Probably the best place to eat if you love all you can eat filet Mignon!! And of course all the other wonderful meat choices they have, which are ribs, lamb,my strip and much more! My ultimate favorite though was the bacon wrapped filet, and reg filet. Also all you can eat salad bar! Great atmosphere and wonderful service! Thank you for the great experience! We will be back! :)))"}
{"text":"Food: 9/10 Service: 10/10 Price: 7/10 Atmosphere: 8/10  Texas de Brazil is simply amazing. It is a Brazilian Steakhouse  meaning that you have about 7-10 selections of meat to pick from in various styles (rare-well-done). The meat is carried on skewers and hand cut from the skewer right to your plate.   The food is awesome. The selections include beef, lamb, chicken and pork. There are also additional items that get added on every few months. But lets be honest you are really going for the steak, which is perfect because you literally have every part of the cow to choose from. I would recommend the garlic sirloin, flank steak, and of course the top sirloin. If you don't like meat don't worry, there is also a salad bar with options ranging from salad to soup to sushi. I usually don't deal with that area too much (gotta save room for the meat lol) but I've only heard good things.  The waiters/ waitresses are awesome and take really good care of you while you're there, providing excellent suggestions as well as giving you information about the whole experience. (RACHEL IS THE BEST!!) The gauchos are super nice and will even ask if you have any special requests once they see that your aren't selecting the meats that have come by. If you say yes, you are the first to receive the meat and it is cooked in whichever style you prefer.   Finally, the biggest knock on Texas de Brazil is the price. Yes, it is $50 per person but you do get unlimited meat and unlimited salad bar access for as long as you wish so it really pays for itself. The experience, food, and service are well worth it and you definitely wouldn't regret spending a family/date night at Texas de Brazil"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the selection of proteins at Texas De Brazil. The sirloin, skirt steak, and filet mignon were exceptionally moist and tender. However, they were over seasoned with salt so you couldn't taste the quality of the meat. The lamb chops, chicken, and pork were presented as an understatement, however they were some of the best I've had. I wish there was a vegetarian option like tofu and grilled veggies for vegetarians, vegans, etc.       The side dishes were mediocre. The cinnamon and sugar plantains didn't marry with the rest of the meal. In fact, it tasted like an overly sweet Starbucks frappiccinno compared to the fatty meat. The mashed potatoes were extremely creamy and buttery, which complemented the lean chicken breast. The bread was a traditional Brazilian bread with cheese. However, it tasted like an boring roll with string cheese from the school cafeteria.       For dessert, I ordered the creme brûlée, which I was impatiently waiting for. It tasted intensely of orange (which is never a bad thing) and weirdly enough, MAYO? It also had the texture of chunky sausage gravy. I recommend that the chef whisk more air bubbles into the custard mix, so it becomes more creamy and airy. Even though there were some things wrong with the meal that was served to me today, I will always enjoy the ambience and party scene of Texas De Brazil!"}
{"text":"We have been waiting for Texas de Brazil to open for a while since it is very close to our house and we love Churiscarria. Very clean and bright restaurant- lots of Windows, which is a bit of a different experience than a similar restaurant downtown. Same prices, felt less fancy.  Food was very good and fresh. Salad bar had a large selection and great cheeses and prepared salads. The meats that were served were great! Loved the lamb chops in particular, but everything we tried was great. Not overly salted.   Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to dine in Vegas and favorite cuisines that makes sure you don't leave hungry!  I've been here many times and tried many Brazilian rodizio steakhouses in Vegas and Texas De Brazil ranks near the top.  Great salad bar selection which stays consistent for the most part as I always tend to chose the same sides but not too much since I'm all about the different meats they serve.  The meats are all flavorful and juicy but definitely require many glasses of water due to the salt element of cooking.  Must haves include the picanha, filet mignon, garlic steak, sausage, flank steak and beef ribs served only at dinner and cut from the slab which melts like butter to the cut.  Service is usually pretty good but I did run into one night of mediocre service where I had to tell the server a few times for one type of meat and it still never showed up so I just gave up and was too full anyways.  Place gets very busy so reservations highly recommended or go around 9 pm since they close at 10 pm.  Desserts are a must if you have room after the meal."}
{"text":"So I write this with great disdain as For several years Texas de Brazil has been a place for birthday celebrations , company dinners and just casual dining because it's my favorite restaurant in all of LAS vegas.   Last night we had a party of 6 and we are all regulars here.   Someone in the kitchen went way too heavy with the salt. All of the sides were OVERLY SALTED. my brother is a well to do chef in Las Vegas and I a chef in my own right. He is a lover of salt and me I like my salt just right and even he The Salt king said wow way too salty. The cous cous , the Brazilian bread balls everything but the meat.   The meat which is usually seasoned so amazingly well went like this salty exterior and unseasoned on the inside. Usually it's a good balance of it all.   Our server tho very sweet was not as attentive as we would like but we didn't get mad because we saw he had a huge section of tables to cover and in no sequence he was all over the restaurant.   Why not give servers a specific section so they can maintain our waters. The food was so salty we were dying of thirst. I mean lord. I've never been so unwilling to fork out over $400 at Texas de Brazil hell I've spent well over $2k there for our company.   Get it together we don't pay a good amount of money to have someone in YOUR KITCHEN who does not know what they are doing. I mean even the Lobster Bisque was inedible because of the levels of salt."}
{"text":"Excellent food for the carnivore! Excellent table side service, and a well stocked bar. I advise arriving early enough to enjoy a glass or two of their house merlot."}
{"text":"Not too hungry? Go for the light dinner - consists just their \"salad bar\" - which is filled with great stuff! Want meat? Oh do they have meat! It's all very good."}
{"text":"All the meats served were excellent. Wait staff was top-notch and the carrot cake was delicious."}
{"text":"The food was much better than I expected. Since it is a chain, expectations are lower. We were seated just before the dinner rush. So we had an easy time getting around the salad bar. The salad bar was almost exciting. We actually loved the salad with the homemade dressings. The bisque was extremely good.  We decided to get meat right away. My teenage sons just couldn't wait. There was a constant flow of meats. We agreed that the flank steak was the best. Our second choice was a toss up because there were so many good choices. I could see how it could get too busy and perhaps the server could forget to bring something requested. But the meat never stops.  We had fun and were pleasantly surprised. We were celebrating two birthdays, so we got two free desserts. Yes, it is expensive so I couldn't go often. But I will certainly go back."}
{"text":"I can finally say I try this place. I heard many good things about this place. I will say this place is a solid four stars for me. I know this place is all about their Brazilian meat, but I am actually a bigger fan of their salad bar. I would come here just for salad bar. I tried one of their cheese I forget the name, it was so delicious! Also they have sushi maki rolls which are pretty good too. The range of the selection is just so wide. They got soup, chilli, cold cuts, cheese, sushi salmon, rice, couscous, shrimps...etc. everything from the salad bar was so tasty. I realized the red meat upset my stomach so I actually didn't have many, those I tried were good though. Also, I got their banana foster as dessert, it was excellent! What a great experience!"}
{"text":"As a vegetarian in a Brazilian steakhouse, I was surprised with the amount of food I was able to eat. They provide a cheaper salad bar only option which is more equipped than your average salad bar.  The cold bar had your usual salad and veggie toppings, bread, cheese, etc. There's a smaller hot bar side with soup (not vegetarian that night sadly), rice, beans, mushrooms, and potatoes. I had more than enough options to choose from - maybe too much because I was dying at the end from too much food! Additionally, at the table, they provide cheese bread, mashed potatoes, and sweet plantains.  Dessert is not included in the meal and unfortunately, you'll have to pay extra if you want that slice of cake. A server comes to you with a tray of options. They have various cakes, pies, an crème brulee. We decided to pass on the dessert because 1) the sweet plantains served as a good dessert and 2) my stomach was already in pain from all the food at the bar.   My biggest complaint would be the disorganized service. Knowing it would be a busy time, we came equipped with a reservation, however, we were not seated until 15 minutes after despite seeing empty tables throughout the room. Even after we were seated, we kept receiving calls because some of the hosts did not realize we were already eating.   At the table, you get cards to notify the meat servers whether you want them to come up to you or not. Obviously as a vegetarian and having only purchased the salad bar option, mine was flipped over to the 'No Thanks\" side. Despite that, servers kept asking me if I wanted meat and one even threw a slice of pork on my plate after I said no. I think the systems has some kinks it could work out.  Despite a few disappointing moments with service, Texas de Brazil gets a 4 star rating from me. The variety and quality of the food went above my expectations. Even though I could eat any of the meat, it was a fun experience to see the unique serving system. I would definitely return in the future (but maybe with less form fitting clothes)"}
{"text":"Blissful gluttony are the words that come to mind first when thinking about the dinner here. So much food and a carnivore's dream. We arrived a little early for our reservation, so we past the time in the bar. Very nice bartender who whipped us up a couple Caipirinhas. I'm glad we weren't too early because I could have went through a few of those, really good.  We got situated at our table. Service was great start to finish. We began with the salad bar. Salad bar is more of a generic description of it. There are so many yummy selections to choose from. Maybe mini buffet is a better description. Here is where the challenge lies though. You're in a Brazilian churrascaria, which means you're there for meat, and do they have the meat. You also want to get your moneys worth. The dinner and drinks add up quickly.  If you make the mistake of trying everything the mini buffet has to offer, then the house wins and you won't be able to get your carnivorous ways on very much, nor your moneys worth. Resist the temptation of sampling a lot of that stuff and get your fill of meat. You can get what the salad bar has to offer at a lot of other places in Vegas, but you can't get that Brazilian steakhouse goodness at many, if any."}
{"text":"We just had our first visit. My husband had been raving about restaurants like this. And for good reason!! The food was wonderful! Such a nice change of \"type of restaurant.\" I loved the exotic choices.  The only thing I would critic is the attitude of some of the meat servers. But they could have just been having a bad night. Wonderful restaurant!"}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here for his birthday and it was amazing!! They are soo friendly and helpful! The food was beyond great. They do offer a lot of meats but try the lamb! The food wasn't dry and was cooked perfectly. Our waitress was very sweet and fast.  Thank you for making our dinner party great!!"}
{"text":"*Military Discount*  A truly world-class meaty experience.  Perfect for a special occasion or date!   Visited on Saturday 9-24-16 at 6PM.  The wait was about an hour so we hung out in the bar and had some drinks.  The bartender that night was *extremely* generous with his pours.  I'm not much of a drinker and I was soused after 2 drinks.    Pro tip: If you go to Sam's Club they have a $100 gift card for this place for only $80 bucks.  They have a pretty sweet military discount of 20% off as well so we ended up eating here for like $66.  DEAL!   After you're seated and order your drinks you're invited to partake in the salad bar.  This ain't no ordinary salad bar...there are many tempting options such as charcuterie meats and cheeses, salads, olives, grilled pineapples, fresh parmesean cheese, sushi, smoked salmon, asparagus, black beans, rice, lobster bisque, cheesy potatoes, mushrooms, and much, much, more.  It's really temping but don't fill up because....  ...After you sit down and flip your card over to green the rodizio guys will start parading their meat around for you.  They have lamb, chicken, pork, and every cut of beef that you can think of at any done-ness level.  My personal favorite is the beef ribs...good lord...they are fall-off-the-bone tender.    I've never had dessert here because I usually gorge myself but I'm sure they're delicious.    This place is worth every penny.  It just doesn't get any better than this."}
{"text":"This place was the bomb!! Not only was the food really good her from the appetizers down to entrees and desserts were great, but even the servers were polite and really professional!!"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my new favorite spots! I had never been to a Brazilian steakhouse before, so I was excited at the chance to check this place out. We got there before they opened, but they still let us come inside and wait in the A/C until they were ready to go. There were a lot of people waiting to be seated, but we still got to our table quickly and our servers were very patient and friendly as we waited for the rest of our group to get there. One of them offered us some recommendations on the drink menu, and educated us about some of the food items we would be offered as well. Once everyone arrived, we walked over to the salad bar which had a ton of great options! There were many different vegetables, soups, salads, and other sides. Among the options, some of the things I chose were lobster bisque, asparagus, mushroom salad, roasted peppers, shrimp, smoked salmon, quinoa and squash. I got very small samples of the sides, knowing that there was still a lot of food to come. After we sat back down at the table, we were told to flip our cards over to green whenever we were ready for the different meats. Once you do that, there is a parade of large skewers being brought around by various servers that have some of the best steak, chicken, and pork that you'll ever find in one place! I had bacon wrapped filet, top sirloin, tenderloin, and garlic steak. Every single one was so flavorful and tender. What I also love, is that they bring different steak temperatures around and ask you if you'd like that, or let you know that they'll be bringing around one that is your preferred temperature soon. If they only have something in medium rare, for example, you can also request that it be cooked longer. There were some of the meats that we really enjoyed at our table, and when we asked for extra slices or larger portions, our server did not hold back! He was very generous and happy to come back frequently to bring anything we needed. We got so much food, and it was definitely worth the price! I will be back here for sure."}
{"text":"Gets better every time! The service is always so genuine and we are always impressed! I highly recommend trying the top sirloin, the garlic filet, and the lamb chop (with the mint jelly). My only reason for not giving a 5 star is the hostesses could be more engaging upon arrival and when exiting....we will be back!"}
{"text":"Impressive restaurant decor'  Super nice customer service.  I will be brief as I see all the 5 Star reviews and I wish I had one to submit. But, unfortunately I can only offer 3 Stars. Here is why. Yes, the salad bar is nice. Where is the lobster in the supposedly famous lobster bisque soup? There was not a piece of lobster in there, just the creamy base(boo). The meats that are being brought around on big skewers is not very good. Every piece of red meat that I had was very tough to chew. (I will not swallow a piece of meat if it doesn't dissolve in my mouth after 20-30 chews) I had to spit a lot of tough meat out(yuck). Than I decided to try the bacon wrapped chicken..it was dry, and I only ate it after I soaked it up with the mashed potatoes. So, not to burst the bubble, I just didn't care for it  Will I go back? Sadly no."}
{"text":"Meat, meat and more meat. If you love meat, you'll probably love this place. If you like meat, it will still be okay, but you may not love it. That's where I'm at with this joint.   I love lamb, and while the lamb chops were good, the rack of lamb of lamb wasn't really. The filet was excellent, as was expected. The other meats were good as well. I guess where I felt the place was missing was the salad bar.   The other Brazilian steakhouse I've been to had a bomb salad bar. While meat should be the strongest thing, I feel the salad bar should be equal. You can't have a great meal without great sides, right?! Mostly everything I picked up off the bar I wasn't thrilled about. And it was a smaller selection than I thought it would be.   Service was excellent, but i would have expected that one because they must be attentive to be bringing you all the meat, meat and more meat and two because the place was pretty dead. It will cost you a pretty penny if you're not indulging though, since the whole meal is around $44. At that point you almost HAVE to keep the courses coming just to get your money's worth. And that, my friends, is not worth it to me."}
{"text":"I love this place. I'm a frequent visitor. The salad bar is very decent and rich, and the meat selection is decent and nice. I just wish they would bring back the BBQ ribs, I used to love them. The way the servers treat you is exceptional. I always enjoy eating in Texas de Brazil."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! We usually go to the one in Miami so whenever we make our way to Vegas (from California), it's a must. The food is delicious!! Tons of things to choose from the buffet and the choice is meats are to die for.  Yum! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"The service was outstanding and the food was so good! The lamb especially! A must come!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location on three separate occasions and I have had a horrible customer service experience everytime. There is a female manager (Caucasian with short hair and what's glasses) who was completely horrid on two of the occasion and a male manager who was a little hefty in size who was also rude. They send coupons they do not honor for one reason or another. I've had my card charged multiple times in on visit. They are completely unaccommodating. For example, once they did not have tap water and you could not order a drink free of charge. So the options you were given was to either be thirsty or pay for something to drink. I've never been to a restaurant where water or some type of drink with your meal wasn't offered. I could go in depth, but as I sit here at the table waiting for my check to be picked up, I realize I'm never coming back ."}
{"text":"I wish it was an option for no stars.  The absolute worst experience I've ever had. Management doesn't care that your not happy with service. I was forced to pay 80 dollars for 2 pieces of meat. I was by passed continuously by waiters and did not receive quality service, compared to the tables of white diners sitting behind me. In the severs defense some people in my party had already closed out, but they are suppose to check for the green flip cards. I was served 2 pieces of meat in 2 hrs. I was offered the same meat four times.  I came with intentions of eating a full meal, and left hungry after spending 2hrs at this restaurant . Worst experience of my life. Spoke with every member of management to try and rectify the situation. Not even an apology, but instead they informed me that they couldn't tell how many pieces of meat I ate. Petty management and petty practices. Was treated like a run a way slave and called a liar. No respect or fucks were given and no reasonable solutions were offered. Once Told management the truth about how I felt and nothing was done. I was a man of my word, the check was 67.00,  I paid 80 dollars only because I was being forced to stay inside the restaurant  and I didn't want problems. I told the manager to his face that I no longer wanted to be in the restaurant after receiving such horrible service.  They wanted me to stay longer and finish my meal, but why would I when the service was already horrible.  Forgot to mention the 40 min wait for the mixed drink we ordered as soon as we got to the table. We will be contacting the corporate office on Monday morning."}
{"text":"A very enjoyable feast of you like your choices of meat. I'd have to say that the house sirloin and the leg of lamb were likely the two favourites for me. The salad bar was fresh and delicious although we showed at 915pm for dinner. Great service and. O waiting for food. My second trip to this location and it didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Sorry but this place SUCKS. I've been here 2 times and both visits have disappointed us. Went here on 12/26/2015 for a late Christmas celebration. We go to the buffet area and it just lacks in quality and selection. It is literally a salad bar. If you've ever been to Tucanos Brazilian steakhouse you would know that their buffet has a wide variety. Tucano's has salad, sushi, bread, pastas, and fruit. Texas de brazil just has lettuce and bacon. Then the meat that they served just SUCKED. They barely brought us any steaks! They mostly brought around the lamb, chicken, and sausage...SAUSAGE?! I mean really?! $50 per head and they give me sausage...wtfreak. The steak that they did bring around was either salty or tasted like armpits (or at least what I imagined what it would taste like). Now here's the real kicker...during weekends your meal is supposed to include drink refills and dessert. YES, dessert is included. Did the waitress mention this? NO!!! She straight up left the check on our table and said have a good day!!! Wtheck right?! So we asked if the dessert came with the meal just to make sure and she said yes. Just blows my mind that we have to even ask! Another big problem was the wait. We got there at 1 and didn't leave till 4!! Not because the food was great but because it was so SLOW! Even after we asked to see the dessert menu the waitress went to the table behind us and showed them first! Once we got our order in it literally took 30 mins to get it! Another thing that annoyed me was their bathroom. Can somebody explain to me why a place like this can't fix their restrooms? The doors DID NOT lock!! There was NO toilet seat covers! One sink was broken, the other had no soap, and only one sink worked! Sorry but this place is one big scam! I'd rather spend my money at a casino buffet!"}
{"text":"Texas de Brazil never disappoints my wife and I. We enjoy this place very much. All in all the servers are awesome. Kaylee S was our server for the night and she is great. Top notch, very attentive , sneaky as well finding out what we were here for. My wife and I were celebrating our Anniversary. We ordered a desert and she made sure It showed \"Happy Anniversary\" on the plate. I'm pretty sure they do it for everyone but still finding out what we were there for is amazing. Little things do matter and it's what make memories. And it also makes us come back every time."}
{"text":"Ok this is always a fun time. I've been to a few of these. This was my 3rd favorite of the 3 and the only chain. However lots to like. Service was an A++. It was a tight ship that really gave you the cyclone of meat experience. When we dropped a napkin someone came running to replace it unprompted. The salad bar was extensive. Lobster bisque in particular was stand out. As well as the filet and lamb chops. The other meat choices were, fine. Some a bit dry like the chicken. Anything wrapped in bacon was incredibly salty. Other Brazillian grills I went to had more daring meat choices like chicken hearts, alligator, seared shark. All in all a really fun macho night out. I had to carry my friend out over my shoulder like we were reinacting the movie Platoon."}
{"text":"Delicious.  I like food well done and they were accommodating to that. The Parmesan chicken was delicious. And at the end we got some BBQ brisket.  Yum!"}
{"text":"This is the second Brazilian steak house I've been too and it's by far the best. The staff is friendly and the environment is calm and clean. Now the food, if you're a meat lover this place is for you. Only thing I wasn't a fan of was the lamb but the chicken, pork and beef were delicious (especially if it's covered in Parmesan). Pricey but worth what you pay for."}
{"text":"Good Brazilian steakhouse.   Totally worth the effort to get there.   You have to understand why you are coming here, it's for the beef and other meats.   Wow, they do it well there.     Chances are unless you have a reservation, you'll have to wait for a table, but that's ok because they have a great bar.   Was there with 3 others, and we only waited for about 20 minutes.   They have a great salad bar, but don't fill up on any of that.  Only pick a few things that you'd like to have in between rounds of meat!   The bacon wrapped filet was very good as was the sirloin.   Most everything was very good.   If you're on a low sodium diet, be careful, this places uses salt to season their beef.   It makes it taste great, but there is salt involved.     Will I be back?  Sure thing.   I'm not a vegan.   lol."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for my graduation dinner this weekend (Hail to Pitt!). I had a reservation for 4:30 PM for a party of 7 people.  We get to the restaurant and we had to wait 15 minutes before being seated. What is the point of making a reservation if I'm not going to be seated right away? I'm usually a pretty patient person but I made an early reservation because we had to get to my graduation. I felt like I was in the Seinfeld episode where he makes a reservation for a rental car and when he gets there, they don't have any cars left for him. And he said exactly what I said, \"That's why you make a reservation. What is the point of making a reservation if it's not going to be ready for when you arrive?\"  Our server Alina was doing the best that she could for us. It was pretty busy, but she was really knowledgeable and a great server. It's not her fault that the bread isn't ready. But everyone was just really behind! Even the meat people hardly came around initially, maybe once or twice within the first 30 minutes of our arrival. We saw meat people going to tables nearby us but never in our section; we weren't the only table having this issue. Our bread didn't come until half way through our meal, along with the mashed potatoes. Our water cups were almost always empty. Service and meat picked up towards the end of our meal, but by that time we were already full from the cold bar and we also needed to leave if I wanted to get to my graduation on time.  The food was delicious but the service honestly sucked. And a place this freaking expensive should have both good food AND good service. It was really irritating knowing that my family asked to go somewhere nice for graduation and they paid so much money for such annoyingly slow service.  Overall for the price, it was a really disappointing evening and experience."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times. Its a great place to go if your celebrating a special occasion or just to have a really nice meal that you get all you want meat.. All kinds! I love the salad bar and love the lobster bisque soup i could make a meal just out of these,  Service is very good!  They come around quite often, I love the rare steaks and the lamb, So many different kinds to pick from,  If you don't get full its your own fault!  There is so many different things to try!  This place gets pretty busy and it is a good idea to have reservations but from what i am reading from some of the other reviews it don't matter if you have one. We have never had a problem getting in.  I love their food and it is hard to compare to other Brazilian restaurants. This one is pretty busy compared to some of the other ones. It is really good.  We highly recommend if you have never had Brazilian food before this is the one to go to first, it was our first and it really made a impression on us for the flavors and all the different meats they have. Try it out!!!"}
{"text":"Food is good, but well over priced for the number of other Brazilian Restaurants we have been to.   Atmosphere was not great the tables were far too close together, we felt rushed by the staff and it was extremely loud and I wasn't even able to hear my wife across the table, again quite different than the other Brazilian Restaurants we have been to.   For the price point it's not somewhere I see us going again when the Melting Pot is across the street."}
{"text":"Ok we came here with a large party to celebrate my niece's 21st birthday while we were in Vegas. My sister chose this place because my niece used to work at Brazilian BBQ restaurant in Portland so I think she picked it. It is just South of the Strip in an outdoor strip mall.  When you walk in, it's definitely a site to behold. Beautiful interior, open space and clean. It's a bit of a different concept, one that I was not used to and was slightly confusing, if I'm being totally honest. You each have a little circular card that has a green side and a red side. You are supposed to put the green side up if you want people to come and offer you some kind of meat, and put the red side up if you need a break. It seemed a bit overwhelming when people kept swooping in and asking if you want Filet Mignon, or Brazilian sausage, or chicken, or whatever else they offered. They keep the meat on a vertical skewer and slice it fresh for you onto your plate. But I kept saying yes. Partly because I wanted to try everything, and partly because I knew if I passed on something, I wouldn't get another opportunity to try it. They didn't come back with that dish. I felt like I never really got to sit and enjoy or savor anything because the next option was standing there waiting for you to say yes or no.  Then they also advise you to go get a plate of what I would call \"sides.\" This was also kind of  confusing for me. I filled up more than one plate on a bunch of side dishes, which was a mistake. But I felt that it wasn't explained well beforehand so I wasn't sure what to do. They have cheeses, sautéed onions, grilled vegetables, soups, etc. Lots of stuff to pile on your plate that you're never going to actually eat.  Don't get me wrong. The food was flavorful. It was mostly all good and I enjoyed it. The prices were high. Everything. But I suppose that's normal for Vegas. To me though, I'm not sure it warranted the expense. You basically pay an AYCE fee ($50 per adult, if I recall correctly), plus drinks. And that was with a 20% discount. They were extremely reasonable with the kids though. It was so little, I don't even recall the amount. But then again, how much is your 2 year old gonna eat? In the end, it was a cool experience but I don't think I'd rush to come back. If someone else picked it again, I wouldn't balk, but I'd probably rather eat at a regular steakhouse."}
{"text":"Terrible service. No by the waitresses, but by the management, treated like a dog that they hated."}
{"text":"Pricey but worth it. Better than other Brazilian steakhouses. Cuts of meat are tender, juicy, & well seasoned. Salad bar is yummy too. Lobster bisque is tasty. I'm a fan of the beef ribs. Service is friendly & attentive."}
{"text":"First visit was very good. The meat was everything I was hoping for. Everything else was wonderful. Salad bar and antipasto as good as any Italian restaurant. Mashed potatoes were great but be a carnivore and pace yourself through this meat lovers paradise. Try it out.  You'll be quite pleased."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant.  The price is high but all you can eat meat, which is excellent is worth it.  The service was wonderful and the facility itself was impeccable.  It is well worth stopping here for a meal if you are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Best steakhouse restaurant in  town, absolutely worths every penny.   I'm very please that I went today to Texas De Brazil, the staff is very efficient and friendly ."}
{"text":"Meat eaters rejoice! This is the place for you. My family has been here several times and it's simply delicious. The whole concept of a Brazilian steakhouse is perfect and in order to really get your money's worth, be sure to come hungry.  First, they have an exceptional salad bar that you can order in its own if you don't want the whole Gaucho meat experience. I did that once and was very happy with my salad and soup and boundless fish and sushi- it's really worth it and I guarantee you will be stuffed when you leave from this alone. As for the Gauchos and the meat- fantastic. All of them wanderer around and bring to your table every possible cut of beef, pork, sausage, and lamb you can imagine. Additionally, various sausages. You simply say yes or No if you want it or not. This is in addition to the great salad bar. You can really spend the whole night here and leave 10 pounds heavier. The food itself is delicious and perfect cooked and awesome. You will never leave disappointed. As for the atmosphere , super pretty inside and reminds me of a high end NYC restaurant right here in Cleveland.  Worth the trip but be sure to go hungry!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday evening.  Three of us on a guys night out.  We were expecting to indulge in a little gluttony and drink and were not disappointed.  The skewered meat selection was great, the wait staff was attentive and the drinks were good.  The wait time for a table was just a few minutes.  While waiting, we sat at the bar and had a drink served by a friendly bartender.  Once seated, the waiter explained the concept to us and we started at the salad bar.  I'm not really sure you should call it a salad bar as there were selections of hot items, sides and more not found at a regular salad bar.  Once we turned our disks to \"green\" the real food started arriving.  Did I mention the big selection of meat?  Everything from chicken to beef to pork to...  Did I mention that there was a lot of well prepared skewered meat?  Some was slightly over salty, but overall it was all well cooked and seasoned.  If you go, bring a big appetite.  This place is appropriate for a group, party, family (although may be a bit much for smaller children) or any festive night out.   Not sure if I would recommend for a first date."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Classic Brazilian style, all you can eat BBQ, prime quality meat sliced to order at  the table. The salad bar is awesome as well, but save the salad until you've had some of the awesome meat."}
{"text":"I live in Los Angeles but come to Vegas at least three times a year and every time I come I make sure to eat at Texas de Brazil. If you love steak and good food then this place is a MUST! Beautiful restaurant with a professional staff that makes you feel like VIP.  The salad bar alone is worth the trip but save room for all that steak AND dessert.   Oh and if you like men in uniform...yea, you want to be here :) great eye candy  Best restaurant in town for sure!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Miguel our waiter was awesome, he made sure we never went without drinks and always made sure we were satisfied with our food. The quality of the meat is top notch. We Will definitely be back again! The salad bar is a great start but save some room for the amazing meat selection. Would recommend to anybody!"}
{"text":"Picanha, lamb chops, top sirloin and flank kept coming in at a great speed. Fernando was great. Andre, one of the managers, was superb as well.  We come every once in a while, since we live far from the Strip, but this place does not disappoint when we make the trip."}
{"text":"Celebrating Dads 81st Birthday.  Great food , great company and Rachel took great care of us. We will be back! !!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent environment and great food! Lots of selections at the salad bar and servers were personable and accommodating! You will get very full!"}
{"text":"Everything was amazing.    The salad bar had a wide variety of brazilian style vegetables,  shrimp, salmon and lobster bisque.  Atfter tasting it I thought I would want to just keepeating from it. I was wrong once I tasted the meat. Everything was seasoned and cooked well.  The servers kept our plates stacked and wetter all very nice.  Once they notice we slowed done they asked what we wanted and I was able to end with a plate of filet mignon.  Great night."}
{"text":"Gotta give it to you worth the price all the fine meats and salad bar I love this place I always recommend it to people my Friend has a birthday dinner been coming back ever since that day like it doesn't get any better than this"}
{"text":"This was an epic meal. If you like meat then this is a must visit resturant. I don't say this often but everything was amazing. Every cut was tender and perfectly seasoned. There is not one menu item I would criticize. The salad bar that was included provided perfect accompaniments  for the cuts of meat. Balsamic onions, roasted garlic cloves, and a nice selection of cheeses just to name a few, enhanced the flavors of the meat. While potatoes, beans and rice provided the starch component. I had heard bad things about the speed of the servers and the quality of the service. I want to say my experience was the exact opposite. My server? Awesomeness! The speed of the carvers was great. I found myself turning over my card to red something I never did at the smaller Green Forrest resturant. They also would prepare the cuts to order . I can not wait to go back."}
{"text":"Everything was wonderful. I took my family here for dinner. They have not stopping raving about it. The food was incredible. The service was excellent. We will be back! Loved the lamb!!"}
{"text":"I really didn't want to come here, because I really despise going to Station Square.  On top of that I'm not a big meat eater but my brother has been dying to try this place so I went. The place was packed which you would think is a good sign but since the majority of people seem to think that fine dining IS a chain restaurant, that didn't tell me much.   You have two options you can either do the salad bar on its own or you can have the salad bar with the meat courses - they have traveling servers who make their way around the dining room with various meat options to offer diners who have ordered full service.  Each person gets a small card with green on one side and red on the other.  Green means that you want meat (or ordered the meat in addition to the salad bar), red means no more meat, and no card means you just ordered the salad bar.  I opted to just go for the salad bar as there was a lot of interesting options available from fresh veggies and cheeses to shrimp, pastas, and salads.  They also had some hot bar items like lobster bisque, roasted potatoes, etc.  My brother and his girlfriend decided to each get the meat with the salad bar, but it ended up that neither of them ate much meat because the salad bar had so much to offer.  Overall the food was good, but it just didn't knock my socks off.   Our server also charged me for the meat option when I only had the salad bar and it was a little bit of a hassle to get it fixed and mostly that was just annoying given that I'd had a conversation with her about my choice prior to making my decision to just go with the salad bar.  Also, the meat servers kept reaching over me to serve meat to others at the table, which was incredibly annoying and also simply lacking proper serving etiquette.  It was a typical \"fancy\" chain restaurant experience.  I can't say that I'd race back there again, but I wouldn't object to going there, though I know that given it's location at Station Square that they will not have any trouble staying busy.  If you really LOVE meat, then this really is the place for you, but if you just \"like\" meat and the thought of eating pounds of it to get your money's worth then you might be better off going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Located in town-square, this is a pretty easy restaurant to spot, as it faces the street.  We bought our gift cards from Costco, you save 20% or $20 off the bill.    Regularly, $100 for 2 people to dine here.  If you're not familiar with churrascaria, the meats are either cooked over coals, barbecue, or could even be roasted.    I found out that they're really into soy bean oil and that goes for both their salad bar and their meats.  If you're allergic to soy, they'll run through the selection for you, but I wish they had it on the menu or something.    Based on your preference really, you can decide on which cuts of meat you think is the best of them all.  The all-you-can-eat meat comes to you, rather having to cook it yourself or plate it yourself.  The leg of lamb along with the lamb chops were great and the top choice was the Brazilian Picanha.  The braised beef ribs and pork ribs were way over seasoned with salt.  Aside from it all, nothing else worth mentioning in my book.   As for the salad bar, the roasted beets, thin hearts of palms and tabbouleh were the ones I went back for seconds.    Service was hit or miss.  We had to ask for lamb chops and the ribs 2-3 times before they decided to make one round in our area.  And when the ribs did come by, they keep passing us by and gesture they'll be back.  The server at the table is nice, cordial, but he can only do so much.    The appetizer bananas was completely covered in sugar and baked, not torched to brown the sugar.  Already pre-made, I couldn't get one without the sugar.  I did expect a little more from my experience, which was not overly salted meat, but that's what we got.    3 stars and I definitely did not stuff myself.  If you want the experience, try going for their cheaper lunch option and still get the same type of food."}
{"text":"Had a really good experience. The only issue was our reservation was late but the manager comped some drinks for us. All the food we were offered was great, and the service was top notch. I'll have to try another location back in Detroit."}
{"text":"Texas de Brazil is a good steakhouse and I really like the salad bar.   It is very expensive but similar for higher end all you can eat buffet style restuarants in Vegas. I tend to enjoy other styles of all I can eat places like Korean but each have their own flavors so it is nice to go on occasion. I recommend going in small groups and not larger parties for the dining experience. All the meat that is brought tableside is cooked excellent and you are offered it cooked in the temperature that you want. Also, you can ask your waiter to have any meat brought over to you."}
{"text":"Every time we're in Vegas, we visit Texas de Brazil. This means in the last three years, I've been here at least 6 times.  Each visit has been excellent. We are always served by very courteous and friendly waiters. The meats are cooked to our liking and come around often. If there's a particular cut or meat we want, the server is quick to get the meat dude to us.  Salad bar area is fully stocked with delicious offerings. I have learned to not eat it all because you will NOT have room for the meats! The grape salad is so delicious. I always save room for that. Onion ceviche is a must when eating the rich meats.  Chimichurri is really good. I rarely eat the mashed potatoes, but when I do, man. Buttery fat inducing goodness. The lil cheese breads are as good as any other place I've been to. I wish I had more room in my stomach to hold them all.  I look forward to coming to the restaurant each time. I dare say I am a bit of an addict.  Highly recommended to my friends and definitely think you should check this place out if you're into churrascaria!"}
{"text":"Our first time at Texas de Brazil..nice Ambience..an O.K.salad bar..altho many things we weren't a fan of..Lobster Bisque I saw was recommended..but if u want any Lobster in it..skip that..and  it was lukewarm..at your table they start bringing the meats..I wasn't impressed..as they were all so SALTY!!  but it is abundant..with your choices..so if u dont mind salty meats..and plenty of it..then u may enjoy this eatery..I give it 3 stars..as it was a special occasion and we enjoyed ourselves..but not for my taste."}
{"text":"Amazing! If you enjoy fine meats and great service, make sure you try this wonderful SteakHouse. It not in the strip either. It's located in a quiet place near Flemings Steak House. My husband in fact said, \" Babe, are you sure you don't want to go to Flemings? \" I replied, \"No babe, I'd like to try something new\" and it was! My husband later said, \" I'm so glad you didn't cave in when I brought up Flemings! This place was AWESOME! So I am now 12 for 12 with the places I have found and enjoyed. Eat healthy and happy everyone!"}
{"text":"Texas de Brazil is always one of my favorite restaurants to visit when friends and family come to town. The staff are always so attentive and ready to order any specific types of meat you may desire. The variety of meat is really terrific, but I always have my favorites: the lamb chops and the beef ribs. The salad bar is also one of the best. I recently wrote a review on Open Table stating that most of the meat is always a little salty. My last visit, all of the meat was perfectly seasoned. Thanks for listening. Texas de Brazil is always a wonderful dining experience. Even if the meat is sometimes a little salty, the servers are always spot on."}
{"text":"Poor service , can't help but to think your just another person trying to get in for the check and right back out the door as fast as possible. What's the rush here guys? On top of all that, you wonderful salad bar is ruined by the poor complete embarrassing customer service this whole establishment had to offer. My server wasn't completely  busy enough to not fill my water as I seen her around the corner on her phone. Not one refill until asked for after the second person. Thanks but I rather spend my money where they care at fogo de chao. They kill it when it comes to service. Pathetic waste of money here folks."}
{"text":"Excellent food and wonderful service!  The quality of the meats and the salad bar was extraordinary. Really good stuff!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I've always loved the services but yesterday my husband and I went for Valentine's Day and the service was horrible! First off we made reservations for 8:30pm and had to wait 15 minutes for a table. Also, we were seated all the way in the back and every time someone that came out of the kitchen they would skip our table and go straight to the front and when they finally came to our table they had no meat. smh We asked one of the waiters for lamb chops and waited 15 minutes till we finally had someone come to our table. I honestly was so disappointed bc it wasn't my first time there and I was hoping to get the same experience I didn't the first time. Otherwise I love the food! Everything taste great"}
{"text":"Our server was Pedro, his service was really good. We couldn't find him to get refills for my husbands drink one time but he did get our quick service for our favorites; filet minion and lamb. Pedro was professional, attentive. He always had a smile on his face, thank you Pedro. Pedro gets a $30 tip. Be like Pedro.  The salad bar is phenomenal. I especially loved their jasmine rice and sushi. Everything is fresh and delicious.  The meat were all very tasty. Tender, juicy and just so mouthwatering (orgasm in my mouth type of deal) I fasted all day just for this. The leg of lamb was a bit rare for me, but everything else was delectable and outstanding.   We had a little room for desert, as for chocolate lovers we had the chocolate mouse, it was dark but not too dark it was perfect.  I have enjoyed every one of my visits here. Thank you for making my husbands first time here enjoyable and making our date night memorable. Spending the money in this was so worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent!  You will get a small card. Green means the servers will continue to bring meat to your table. Red means they will bypass your table until you turn your card again.  They will bring around huge skewers of perfectly cooked meat. The waiter will also bring fried banana as a palate cleanser and garlic mashed potatoes probably to fill your stomach. They also have a huge \"salad bar\" with sushi, cheeses, vegetables, and soups.  They have a large selections of wine available by glass or bottle.  The price is pretty steep but you will get your money's worth. We paid about 50$ per plate.  This would be a great place for a special event.  Will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"I've been here over a dozen times and I am always satisfied with everything. But this past weekend was the best of all. Mariana our server was amazing, made my experience the best ever. Highly recommend Texas de Brazil to all those stake house lovers, and ask for Mariana to be your server she will make your visit the best ever."}
{"text":"I've only been here twice but this is by far my favorite restaurant! Service is outstanding with the best salad bar I've ever had. All of the meats were good but my favorite is the garlic steak...delicious!! Money well spent. Please go, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to try this place and YES, it is really good! If you've ever been to a Brazilian Steakhouse, then you know that they have a salad bar matched with people walking around with meat.  Be sure to \"flip over\" your table card from RED to GREEN so the meat can begin!  My favorite cuts were the flank steak and House Special Top Sirlion both rare to medium rare.  The top sirlion is the one that kind of looks like it's heart shaped once they cut through it. I can just taste the fat! You can't miss it.  The chicken cuts were okay. Some of the other cuts were too salty.  I do remember the sausage being a tasty as well.    The salad bar did have cuts of cheese, some sushi, but I didn't spend too much time there.   Thankfully we got some gift cards as gifts otherwise this place is really pricey.  You can reserve a table online!  NEGATIVES:   - It was Saturday night dinner time when we were there.  The service, everytime they did come, they were great but with so many tables I felt like we barely saw our server. - LOUD! It was difficult to hear our conversations across the table.  Maybe it was because it was full but be prepared."}
{"text":"Well I came to the bar.  I needed to kill some time. Nubia the bartender is a freaking doll. So sweet. I didn't realize they have these amazing appetizers for$10 For protein basically. I could go to greens and proteins and spend twice as much and not get as much. You can't beat the atmosphere and chimmichuri sauce. The other bartender was sweet as well. Didn't catch her name. Will be back. Thank you!"}
{"text":"My first time going and I will definitely be back!  We got service from hostess, managers, carvers etc...  The salad bar it self is something to rave about. Sushi,  soups, cheese, meat,  slices SLICES of BACON!!! All the side you can think of.  Now the meat,  I start sweating thinking of it. The lamb was my favorite meat. The nice crisp outside followed by the moist center. Yummy.  The sausage was delicious, the chicken,  the prime rib,  the bacon wrapped steak.  I mean you will definitely find something your taste buds will enjoy. We of course had desert.  I had the best cheesecake of my life, my friend had the best carrot cake. This place times service is worth every penny!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible! My group of 9 people came here the other day and it was like eating out of a salt shaker. We cut our meal short because it was so bad.  It says a lot when you leave an AYCE spot early with room in your stomach. I went to get a lot of rice to cancel out the saltiness of the meat but even the rice had too much salt."}
{"text":"Last night was our first time to Texas de Brazil and my expectations were blown away. The food was outstanding and the cheesecake was delicious. Our server Adam was very welcoming and extremely knowledgeable. He had us laughing throughout our whole dinner. He was an exceptional server and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Quite a bit of fun. Lots of food and festive. Texas de Brasil offers the typical American take on a Brazilian Steak House. The unique serving style can only be found at a couple of local places in the Pittsburgh region.  All of the Brasil steakhouse restaurants in Pgh are similar. They are all delicious. Texas de Brasil is superior in the sense that Station Square is by far a much nicer setting for a night out in comparison to the local competing Brazilian style steak houses. Texas de Brasil is a national chain and one can expect the consistency found in most national chains.  Consistency is good.   I highly recommend avoiding this location during any promotional events. We made the mistake of making a reservation without realizing it was restaurant week. The place was packed beyond packed and the restaurant experience was not worth the small discount offered.  The staff appeared a bit stretched thin and wait times on meat carvings was much longer than usual.  Wait staff was a tab bit less attentive than usual. For example we had to ask for the meat servers to return at least five times before they did so. (That is unheard of during other nights we have dined) Also, the mint jelly did not taste the way it typically does and the waitstaff seemed too spread thin to be concerned about the fermented quality. (Sadly their mint jelly is what makes their lamb exceptional)   Go on a regular evening so you can leisurely dine without the insanity of over bookings. Yes, the experience is not low cost however it's a fun evening out. Expect on a regular evening to be FLOCKED with various meat carvings. Food and drinks arrive quickly and the staff will be charming.  You will leave satisfied and slightly shocked at the amount of meat you can consume! Texas de Brasil is a great location for a family night out."}
