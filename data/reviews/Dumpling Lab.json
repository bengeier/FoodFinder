{"text":"Dumplings were fairly average. No customer service. Super slow with food. No napkins, share plates or cutlery. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Went here on a weekday evening and had the place to ourselves. There are two menus, one consisting of dumplings ranging from traditional to unusual, and the other listing non-dumpling \"experiments\" like a sesame Caesar salad. We went for the mixed dumpling platter, which gets you your choice of 6x4 types of dumpling, drinks, and two sides. We went traditional (one each steamed, boiled, and fried), and unusual for dessert with a peanut butter and black sesame dumpling. The kimchi and potato salad (with bacon) sides were good, and their secret sweet/spicy dipping sauce for the dumplings was memorable. The traditional dumplings all had a nice wrapper and tasty filling, but the PB/sesame ones were a real treat. We'll probably be back to try many of the other dumplings and another fix of the sauce given the reasonable pricing (whole meal was less than $25 with Yelp check-in offer)."}
{"text":"Very unique and modern restaurant! You can either have the traditional dumplings or a more creative, fusion, and playful dumpling. I tried the butternut squash dumpling... VERY good for desert! The mango and shrimp dumpling has a very interesting taste that works well and compliments each other. Definitely give it a try!! They also have beer on tap!! Can't find that in china town. Will come back again."}
{"text":"Delicious and unique dumplings! Definitely try the butternut squash potstickers and the ribs on the experimental menu."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Came here for lunch and it took roughly 20 minutes (very slow) to prepare our 3 set lunches. The dumplings didn't taste any different than the frozen type from the Asian grocery store and even the kimchi they provided on the side are from prepackaged jars from the store. Not good value, especially in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Great dumplings and sides! Definitely order the pork belly off the appetizer menu. Next time we want to try the soup dumplings!"}
{"text":"What drew me to Dumpling Lab was the ginormous XLXLB dumpling I'd seen all over Instagram, however we didn't try it as we thought it might be too heavy as a lunch option.   Instead we got the steamed lunch box (pork cabbage shrimp & mango shrimp) and the potsticker lunch box (chicken corn pine nut & pork cabbage shitake), both came with the daily featured black sesame peanut butter dessert dumplings. For our sides we got the edamame, kimchi, teriyaki chicken wrap and potato salad.  Although I preferred the potstickers (who doesn't love pan seared crispiness?), the steamed mango shrimp ones were a unique and surprisingly delish sweet and salty combo.  The dessert dumplings were sooooooo good! Granted they were super sticky and got stuck in our teeth as we ate lol The condensate milk glaze gave it an extra touch of sweetness.  I'd like to come back here for dinner, they have more dumpling options, starters (miso braised pork belly!) and maybe try the XLXLB dumpling!"}
{"text":"Interior is nice, but the dumpling have a weird taste to it."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. I appreciate the concept and guts of the owners. chinatown needs places like this to stay alive. But the food is lacking. Some traditional honestly dumplings is what this place needs."}
{"text":"13 dollar for 10 dumplings. I paid 27 dollars for 20 dumplings. And dumplings is really just normal dumplings. And i ask for share plates for my family of three. I got one. Really bad!! Will not recommend."}
{"text":"So good! The service was good, and the concept and atmosphere are super cool as well. I got the kimchi starter, pork, cabbage&shrimp steamed dumpling and the chicken, corn & pine nut potstickers. Both were awesome. The chili oil dipping sauce was just wonderful. 10/10 would return."}
{"text":"Dumpling Lab has such an interesting selection, but we were disappointed by the quality and the way you can select.  We ordered the shrimp and mango dumplings were mediocre and chewy and the shrimp were not fresh.  The pork,lotus and jalapeno were good.  They were out of 4 different kinds and also beer on tap.  I won't waste my time or money there again"}
{"text":"I love this place! I went with a friend and we ordered this giant meal where you get 36 dumplings and 3 sides! You can pick 6 flavors, so we tried all sorts of cool dumplings - some fried, some steamed, some sweet, some savoury! We literally loved them all, and had leftovers for the next day. I love the vibe of this place, and the drinks were great too! I had kombucha and my friend had homemade root beer. If I lived in Calgary, I would be here all of the time!"}
{"text":"Cool concept for a casual dumpling restaurant. The dumplings are more of a fusion/modern style rather than traditional. Was not a big fan of the dumpling skins as I found them too thick and hard. Could improve with some tweaks."}
{"text":"Nothing special about the dumplings, in fact when I went they were dry, tasteless and very pricey! I will not be going back.."}
{"text":"We were in Chinatown during the late afternoon so decided to check out Dumpling Lab for an early dinner.  It has been a while since I've had dumplings, and given this restaurant's catchy title, I was curious to try it out!  Atmosphere: 3.5/5  Interesting decor with art and the creation of a fad by having dumpling lab T shirts for sale.  It was good to see a few tables as well as take out at such an odd time (4PM) which is neither lunch nor dinner.  We did get confused as there was an outside entrance which was dysfunctional and an indoor one.  Relaxed and casual atmosphere.  Food: 3/5  We ended up ordering the steamed pork, cabbage and shrimp dumplings, and cabbage, tofu, glass noodle potsticker, as well as their ramen noodle.  I am more used to dumplings in Asian restaurants, so some of the menu items puzzled me since those specific ingredients are not usually found together, but it was an interesting experience! I wouldn't mind trying some of their other dumplings, but to me it still felt a bit like an experiment and I am more used to the traditional recipes.  Service: 3/5  Friendly however not very efficient as there was only one person preparing the dumplings and serving, so it did take a while to receive our order.  Price: 3/5 ok for the amount of food  Overall: 3/5  Overall interesting to try this restaurant which attempts to create a culture of dumplings.  I wouldn't mind trying some of their other creations but still prefer more traditional combination of ingredients."}
{"text":"It was a tough decision for dinner while visiting Calgary, but I decided to check this place out despite the 3.5 rating on Yelp!  I was actually pleasantly surprised. I had the Tuna Poke and one of the pan seared pork dumplings. Both were quite small, so if bought individually it's more of a light snack.  Poke with tortilla chips was okay, thought the choice in chips was a little weird. But I really like the dumplings, which is why it gets 4 stars.  Also had the Ginger Beer. Warning, it's not a full pint, more like a half pint. It was okay."}
{"text":"I never tried their dumplings before their \"revamp\" - I heard really negative things so I didn't want to try.  Then a friend mentioned that they've changed their menu and suggested we go try.  I was hesitant, but I have been back a few times now!  I usually get their lunch bento with miso braised pork belly on rice which comes with a generous portion of that, six of their daily dumplings, two of their dessert dumplings (rotates), two small portions of their sides as well as tea.  The miso braised pork belly on rice to me is like their rendition of \"lu rou fan\" (Taiwanese minced pork on rice) and it's quite tasty.  I like that it's not super salty like the actual lu rou fan.  The dumplings are actually quite well made - thin skin with a good portion of meat filling.  The kaboocha squash dessert dumplings are my ultimate favorite - I actually crave this and I don't know why, but it's so good and the flavor is spot on! The black sesame ones are a tad too thick - it would taste better if they can thin out the consistency a little bit.  So, if you haven't try them lately, go do so! You may be surprised."}
{"text":"I'm giving Dumpling Lab three stars for now.  I expect this will only get better as I try more of the menu.  Its a relatively new lunch style (i.e. order at the counter) restaurant in Chinatown.  Pretty novel idea, staff with awesome attitudes and some real try hard underneath it all.  I ordered the boiled dumplings, which come in orders of 16.  You can mix within cooking styles (i.e. boiled, steamed and pan fried), but not across.  For some reason, I ordered boiled (7 beef/carrot, 7 can't rememeber and 2 sesame/peanut butter).  A little bland, but it was pretty much exactly as I should have imagined.  I was probably in more of a pan fried mood.  So, \"...it's not you... it's me... is likely why it was a three star night...\"  With edemame and a pop it was about $20, which was fine.  I like it and will be back."}
{"text":"Popped into this place around 3pm, was sorta hungry and didnt want to order a large meal. The staff there were really awesome, they said I could get the kids meal...so I did!  The dumplings I had had a great wrapper, springy and good chew and the stuffing was meaty, moist and delicious.  I liked most that you could customize your dipping sauce at the sauce station. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"We tried the dumpling lab first at global fest 2017 where it was pretty good! We decided to try their home location in China town. It's a quaint little restaurant with an open kitchen where you can watch as they steam, boil or pan fry all of the dumplings. We got the 3-4 person platter for a very hungry group of two and felt quite full after. The jalape√±o beef dumplings are quite nice! The mango shrimp were my favourite but I suspect they may be an acquired taste. Service was quick, we got our appetizers quickly. We saw a number of skip the dishes couriers coming in as well. It is quite a popular little spot!"}
{"text":"I was there last week for a soft opening and was so happy to see such a cool and innovative but simple concept open in China Town. We were greeted with lovely ladies crafting dumping in lab coats and the  full scientific get up. We were greeted and explained the menu. we both went for the steam box - yam dumplings, pork and cabbage -both were boiled. And it comes with kimchi, seaweed salad and edamame. The whole entree was awesome. There is a lab of potions and vinegars to mix together to create a spicy or vinegar dip for your dumplings. We really enjoyed it and will definitely be back. I was so impressed I felt the need to photograph my lunch."}
{"text":"I came very excited about this concept. I will say that the glassed-in display-front where you can watch them being made is a great idea, and the overall decor of the place is clean and modern. Unfortunately, everything was a big disappointment from there.  First of all, I expected there to be a wider variety of fillings, and at least 4 or 5 very unique or unexpected. Most were quite basic asian fillings, variations on pork or onions and the like. (They were all out of one potsticker with ricotta in it, which did sound good.) I was disappointed that there were only a few unique fillings. I was still fairly excited about trying a whole bunch of different ones, until I was informed that it was not allowed! They not only do not allow mixing and matching different dumplings, but they have a minimum order of 16 dumplings at once! To make matters even worse, you cannot order more or less as your appetite may dictate after that, but instead only in full multiples of 16 at a time! But, even if you want that many (16 or 32 or 48), you are still restricted to ONLY TWO TYPES OF DUMPLINGS for EVERY 16 of them! So, in my eyes, all of the fun that I could have had trying varieties of dumplings was destroyed.   It got worse. Next, my daughter crashed to the floor. She'd been given a damaged chair, with one of the legs bent inwards, making it unstable. The server was attentive and asked if she was okay. However, the matter was left at that. While not necessary, it would have been nice to offer her a free dessert dumpling, or an effusive apology from the manager (since they are responsible for customer safety), or maybe even a discount off our bill for this accident.  Then, our food arrived. The pork dumpling was good, but nothing special. But to my dismay, all of the mango dumplings had RAW dough in the centre on one side. After pointing it out, they made us a new batch of them, but unbelievably, they too had stretchy, gooey raw dough in the centers. We did not eat all of them, it was too off-putting. I let them know that the second batch was also raw when they came and took up the plate before giving us another. The giant dumpling was just okay. Oddly, it came with straws. When I asked why, the server indicated that we should suck soup out of it. We dutifully tried, but there was honestly absolutely nothing liquid to sip. That was just plain confusing. The beef dumpling was just okay. The chicken and pine nut dumpling was better... it had a crunchy fry to one flattened side which made biting into it delightful. The filling was again, just okay. The best thing I can say about the food we had, overall, was that the dough - when fully cooked - was fresh and pleasant in bite and flavour.  They had 4 \"dipping sauces\", although counting soy sauce and chili oil as a fun variety of dips is a stretch, if you ask me. Their signature D-Lab sauce was good, however, particularly if you enjoy a sweet kind of soy.  In the end, they did give us 10% off for the partly raw dumplings. In my opinion, if you serve uncooked food (especially if it is your ONLY food!) that item should definitely be at no charge. At least they did acknowledge it, kudos for that. Really though, all things considered, it was more unpleasant than enjoyable, and I will not be returning. Hopefully the owners might read this and consider adding more varieties of fillings, a new sauce or two, reviting the cooking protocol, and remove the ridiculous \"buy only 16 dumplings of only two flavours\" limitation."}
{"text":"Dumpling Lab has a very unique atmosphere - there are a couple older women at the store front window showcasing their dumpling-making skills which displays a more traditional Asian scene, while the interior of the store is very modern and minimalistic. I quite like the combination of the traditional modern vibe. There are tables available for you to eat in store, with adequate charger stations available at their bar table for those who wish to spend a few hours idling there. Take out is also available for freshly made dumplings, while frozen dumplings are also conveniently abundant for you to take home to eat at your own time.  It's currently their soft opening, so they are still in the works of finalizing their dumplings and making sure everything is how they see fit.  I've tried their Boiled Pork + Shrimp + Chive - the flavour was very tasty and different. I could tell it was handmade; however I felt that their wrap was a bit too thick for my liking. For a small order, I paid $12 to get 10 dumplings, which comes with seaweed salad and kimchi on the side. I thought this was really expensive for what it was.   Dumpling Lab offers a large variety of sauces to accompany your dumplings regardless of if you eat in or take out (to-go sauce containers are available!), such as balsamic vinaigrette, sweet chili, your basic soy sauce to their own special house made chili oil. While I love the array of sauces available, I really could not see what was so special with the house made chili oil; it lacked flavour and tasted like regular oil. In additional to the sauces, I suppose the prices are higher as tea bags are complimentary with every order. You pick up your tea bag at the cashier where you can then proceed to the water station to make your own tea.   I also bought a box of black sesame and peanut butter in squid ink wrap to bring home. Those were very delicious; I much preferred this over the pork/shrimp/chive that I tried in store. As Dumpling Lab is still in the works of preparing for their grand opening, their frozen dumplings lack cooking instructions, so I had to ask the owner for steps in doing so.  While the dumplings were tasty, I felt like the savoury dumpling I tried wasn't that special for me to repurchase at this hefty price tag. On the other hand, I might return again for the black sesame/peanut butter dumplings. Dumpling Lab has potential, but I feel like there is still room for improvement, whether it is improving the dumpling experience to justify its prices or lowering the price to better quantify what is being sold."}
{"text":"Incredible dumplings and pretty good service! Would highly recommend to dumpling lovers."}
{"text":"The food was good but it was sad 'cause I wanted to order the box and they only have it during lunch time which I can never come at"}
{"text":"Well this place is unique but I am not a fan. I got the pot sticker dumplings lunch combo for $13. So it came with: 8 pork cabbage shitake mushrooms 4 pork lotus roots Jalapeno 2 daily desserts 2 Add-ons which I got the seaweed and chicken teriyaki wrap  portion is a good size but it could be too much dough. It was filling but not the kind of filling I expect.   I didn't like the pork lotus roots jalapeno unless you like spicy. Too much jalapeno. the pork was ok. But the way they fried it doesn't have that nice fried taste to it that I expect. It was a bit oily for the dumpling. The dessert was a yam dumpling. It was hot and had a very doughy texture.   Maybe its not my forte."}
{"text":"So it might be grounds for separation if my spouse found out I'm rating Dumpling Lab 3 stars, but I was just not as enamoured with the offerings as he. We visited twice during a weekend getaway to Calgary, and bought some take-home dumplings, but I would sooner try another place than return here. The flavour combinations sound really good, but I found in reality the mix was too muted to be enjoyable. Couldn't taste much kimchi or any mushrooms in the beef-kimchi-shiitake dumplings, and the jalape√±o flavour was noticeably absent in the pork-lotus root-jalape√±o dumplings. The XLB was big but I found the filling a bit fatty with the ground pork, and the XLB dumpling itself was a bit chewy.  Not that it was bad, but I was a little disappointed in the flavours. Given the chef is Japanese, my spouse asked about gyoza - the pan fried pork-shiitake-cabbage dumplings are pretty much gyoza, and these were quite flavourful. I also tried the tan-tan, which was OK, a bit too sweet for my taste with the Japanese curry sauce. The ramen alternative was much better - the noodles in both dishes were perfect.  There were a few hiccups with the bill too. The server forgot to take off the charge for a carpaccio special I ordered only to find out it was not available (yet no one bothered to remove the special taped on the menu, all 6 of them that advertised it). Then he forgot to add the charge for the take-home dumplings. No paper bill is presented, it's all on an iPad, so be sure to check what you've been charged for.   Great price for dumplings, interesting flavour combos, but the overall experience was average."}
{"text":"Friday at 8pm. Decided to fill up on dumplings. You can choose 2 kinds and get 16 for $14.  I had the pan fried pork, lotus root and jalape√±o plus the steamed pork, shrimp and chive.  Both were tasty and I tried them with assorted sauces that you can self serve. The sauces are in jars with turkey basters that you squirt into small cups. There was chili, soy, a house made sauce and black vinegar available.   Hubby had the steamed pork and shrimp and said it was tasty while our son had the daily special of ramen with egg, BBQ pork and wontons. The soup broth was very porky with a sweetness that can only come from pork bones and dried mushrooms. Very reminiscent of my mom's pork broth from my childhood...ramen was cooked al dente and there was a slice of super tender pork, seaweed and corn in the soup. We all tasted it and agreed to get it again.   Since I checked in using Yelp, the 20% off an appie expired so they gave me 10% off instead. It's a small gesture but a nice one. I ordered the chicken wrap- it's like a shrimp salad roll but with chicken, red peppers, carrot, bean sprouts and a light aioli to dip into.  Our server was fantastic and attentive and our food came out piping hot in under 15min.   Do note that this place is inside a mall and it can get drafty when the doors open so be prepared. You are not going here for ambience but for good dumplings in a small, well lit the place that needs a key to use the washroom that's out in the main mall. Go here to get your dumpling fix. We'll be back to try other flavours soon!"}
{"text":"Amanda and I went to the make it show at the stampede grounds Saturday afternoon - instead of dealing with traffic and looking for parking, we decided to take the train. After the show, we decided to hit up China town to explore since we were in the area. We took two stops from Victoria Park station, got off at 3rd street station and walked a bit towards Dragon city mall.  Anyways, this review is on the Dumpling Lab so I shouldn't bore you with my adventures. We walked along the main road in China town and discovered many different shops and restaurants we never knew existed. The Dumpling Lab happen to be one we came across. I've heard about the dumpling lab because my sister told me about the xiao long bao (aka soup dumpling) so Amanda and I decided to take a peek inside. We were happily greeted and the girl up front asked if we were staying or taking out. We originally just wanted to take a look at the menu then we decided to try the XLXLB since the menu said 'a must try'... we didn't want to argue. We shared one XLXLB -  for those of you who don't know what a xiao long bao is, it's a steamed dumpling filled with soup. At the dumpling lab, they serve an X-tra large xiao long bao and give you a straw. Traditionally xiao long baos are served hot in bamboo baskets but at the dumpling lab, its on a glass plate. At the front when you order, they have a sign that tells you how long dumplings will take and in our case, it was ~10 minutes. For a Saturday evening, just before 6pm, we were surprisingly the only ones there. I did notice that there were some skip the dishes delivery people picking up orders which seemed smart on a snowy Saturday evening.  It seemed a little longer than 10 minutes but we weren't in any rush - our XLXLB came with one straw and fork so we asked for another set. We poked our straws in and the soup was piping hot! Amanda and I both thought that it was a great bite for a cold wintery day. The soup was nice and flavorful but the filling was lacking a bit, it's almost as they filled it mostly with soup and a little bit of filling, still good though! We noticed small pieces of corn and tiny shrimp throughout our bites. It was a perfect snack!  Oh yeah, Amanda also got a cup of Annex Ale Root Beer because it was on tap and it was quite good! A nice root beer flavor with a strong carbonation.    The dumpling lab is a great addition to China town! They have a small menu that primarily serves dumplings (obviiii). Their starts include: caesar salad, miso chicken, tuna poke, pork belly, pork ribs, potato salad, seaweed salad, kimchi, edamame, teriyaki wrap and the dumpling offerings include your choice of steamed, boiled, or potsticker (deep fried) and different fillings - pork, chicken, beef, veggie. They also have dessert dumplings: black sesame, kabocha squash, yam and some mochi.   If you want a little taste of some items, they have the option for a taster's platter which is known as the 'clinical trial' which includes a small sampling of the popular starters + 10 dumplings or if you're around the area for lunch, pop by for a lunchbox special which is offered M-F from 11am-2pm! By the looks of pictures, the lunch box special looks delicious!  I will be back to try it alllll!!  Ps. They have take home dumplings in the freezer section if you're on the run"}
{"text":"We went there as a group and we had variety of dumplings. They are pretty unique. We tried the desert dumplings (sesame and peanut)  and they were surprisingly good! In general potstickers are out too choice. The service was welcoming and we enjoyed the vibes. The only downside is it is a bit slow but I guess there were 10 of us and there were so many choices."}
{"text":"Had a wicked craving for dumplings and a friend and I decided to check this place out. Place itself is small and cute, with an area showing off staff freshly preparing the dumplings. Beware though the place can get REALLY drafty. We sat at the seats furthest from the door, yet you can still feel the Calgary winter coming in. Even though we saw many photos of their MASSIVE soup dumping all around social media, we decided to save that for next time and stick to the dumplings.   Their dumpling platter jumped out at us. For only $42, you get to choose 36 dumplings (6 flavours) and your choice of 3 starters (small, med, large). I thought it was a good sampling platter. It says it serves 3-4, but the 2 of us were hungry and ambitious so we took it on. We had a little left over so I would say it would be the perfect size for 3 people. They had 3 types of dumplings: steamed, boiled and potsticker. It was hard to remember which ones were what, but I can say that I really liked all of them. I found out that my favourites were pork + shrimp + chives and pork + shrimp + cabbage. Definitely gearing towards the pork and shrimp combo haha. Each of the dumplings were pretty flavourful and moist and the wrapper also had a good chew. The starters we had were the potato salad, spicy miso chicken and the miso braised pork belly. Potato salad was standard, but good. Spicy miso chicken was pretty small, despite it being a 'medium' starter, and had only small pieces of shredded chicken mixed with some sprouts, so it was little forgetful. Pork belly was really flavourful in thick miso sauce.   They also have an abundance of dumpling sauces, each in their own science beaker which is super cute, fitting the whole 'lab' theme. I like the dumpling lab sauce the best, its similar to your standard gyoza-vinegar sauce.   Overall, I really liked the place. The service is super friendly and I think you get a good bang for your buck. They are also on skipthedishes if you don't feel like leaving your place, orders over $20 have free delivery!"}
{"text":"Sooooo good!  Our server was super helpful. She was well versed in the menu, and was able to answer any question we threw at her, and gave helpful information over and above what we asked.   The dumplings we delicious! You have to try the sesame peanut dumplings. Yum yum!"}
