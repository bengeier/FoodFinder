{"text":"Live right around the corner and was excited that someone had taken over after Rose's left. It's still early to tell for sure but it seemed a little unorganized. I'm only judging the ice cream since we did not have pizza this time but it was a bit on the icy side. I had cookie dough and it wasn't the best I'd ever had. Pizza didn't look like it was made fresh but I will have to try a slice to truly judge it."}
{"text":"Imagine finding fabulous pizza right in your own neighborhood!! it has the most delicious thin tasty crust and the toppings are perfect and it is not drowned with slimy cheap cheese.  They even use a bio degradable box!!  My grandson who loves pizza and is eight said \"wow this is the best pizza ever\".. I agree."}
{"text":"The pizza is good, the Italian hoagie is wonderful, and the people who work there are always so polite and personable. Plus, they are a wonderful addition to the community. I hope they stay for a long time."}
{"text":"This pizza place is amazing. You can see the pizza being made. The same guys work there all the time. Wide variety of ice cream flavors too."}
{"text":"I hate to give bad reviews, but maybe the owners will read this and consider making some changes. It smells terrible in there. Pizza is supposed to smell good and it just smells like hot garbage in there. The ice cream was freezer burned. It is not hard to make ice cream good, especially if it's not made on the premises. I will say, however, the staff has always been very nice and they have ample outdoor seating."}
{"text":"My co-diner and I were really excited this summer when we saw that this pizza place was opening up. We finally made it here for food, stopping for pizza at around 8 on a Thursday. The tables were empty, which is concerning because it's hard to imagine how this pizza place will be able to maintain enough business to stay open. It bills itself as being in Regent Square, but it's not exactly IN Regent Square. I'm hoping that the summer will bring diners from Frick Park across the street, because I don't want to lose this great new pizza place.

We ordered an XL pizza, which is smaller than we thought it would be but still a nice size. The two of us ate nearly the entire thing for dinner, though. We got the Margherita Pizza and it was delicious, though I wish it had had more basil on it. We only had to wait about ten minutes for our za. The prices are reasonable and the hoagies and ice cream also look good. Please consider giving your business to this new restaurant!"}
{"text":"Quality pizza, reasonably priced. I'm lazy, so I would like them to deliver, but otherwise, a great place to grab dinner."}
{"text":"Had takeout here today. Pizza was very good and the hot sausage  hoagie was great."}
{"text":"these guys are awesome! their pizza is great and so are the subs. I mean hoagies. lets make sure this place stays in business for a long time! such a refreshing change for the Square."}
{"text":"Nothing is wrong with parks pizza and cream; I just wasn't that impressed.  Service was good, food was super cheap, but the pizza was just...meh.  Definitely a good spot if you're looking for a cheap, fast lunch, but there's better pizza nearby in Squirrel hill."}
{"text":"Better then anticipated. I picked up a pie here purely out of convenience and didn't expect much. It's now my top 2 pizza spots. Quality ingredients and VERY good crust."}
{"text":"It's an ice cream place and a pizza place. How can you go wrong?

They have both scoop and soft serve.  I've had booth. They're pretty heavy on servings for both ice cream and the toppings. They've got seating outside to enjoy your ice cream and worst case, you cross the street and sit in the park.

The pizza is fantastic. I've only ever ordered whole pizzas to go. The pizza has always been well prepared. I like my pepperoni a little crispy and they deliver. The sauce is a little bit sweeter than most places, but not what I'd call a sweet sauce."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for a while. Very happy I finally did and can assure you my return will be often. From the moment you walk in you are greeted by the staff and made to feel welcomed. 

The pricing here is great, my total here for the amount of food I got was better than most chains and enough for two meals. I ordered a 10 inch six cut pepperoni pizza with a lemonade for the drink. I picked this because I thought I wouldn't eat at much and I'd have room to try one of their ice cream treats.  WRONG!  The amount of cheese put on the pizza was more than enough and really filled me up. I didn't even have enough room to get the free refill for my drink. My friend first decided to get half a meatball hoagie, but the staff directed him to get the special, a whole hoagie and drink for less than a buck more.  He also got an order of fries.  We were informed that they weren't even going to have hoagies when they first opened and just by chance started. Once they caught on, the rest is history. 

Everything is cooked right after you order. And I mean fresh from the oven. Even the fries go in the oven, no fryer here (healthy fries, yes please).  

You can tell this place is meant for the warmer months too, with a window to order from on the sidewalk. Only four tables inside for indoor dining.  During warmer months I'm sure most people would like an ice cream treat and then go to Frick Park to walk it off."}
{"text":"This is a rather average ice cream shop serving pizza and a limited variety of soft serve ice creams.  It is sitting on a gold mine of a location near Frick Park.  Because of this it is often crowded and the service slow.  Nevertheless if you are nearby and craving an ice cream cone, the swirl cone is good."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were really wanting a milkshake last night after we made dinner, but didn't feel like going anywhere far, and I didn't want to go to the store to buy supplies to make it ourselves.

I remembered this place, as I pass it every day since it's literally .10 miles from my house. We decided to walk over and were pleasantly surprised with the little shop. It had a number of foods you'd normally see at a pizza shop, but they had a great ice cream selection (probably 20 flavors, plus your standard flavors) and reasonable prices. The milk shake was very good and will go back for their food next time too! 

If you're in the Regent Square, Swissvale, Edgewood area and want a good milk shake without going to one of the other trendy milk shake shoppes around, stop in here and be surprised!"}
{"text":"Park Pizza & Cream was conveniently located in walking distance from rehearsals I had to attend last year.  We ended up here for pizza quite a bit.  The pizza tasted good and was reasonably priced.  I remember getting a slush puppy once too that was pretty good.  Nothing special pizza wise but solid quality!

I'm questioning why I never got ice cream here now because it seems that I should have.  I failed.

The biggest thing was that the workers were SUPER friendly.  One night we accidentally walked in about five minutes after closing time.  The workers wouldn't take no for an answer and let us put in orders!  It was very sweet and considerate of them."}
{"text":"To me, absolutely among the best Pizza in Pittsburgh.  As a former NYC native, I find most pizza in the 'burg to be bland and sorely lacking.  NOT Park Pizza! The crust is the perfect consistency.  The sauce is flavorful and spiced just right.  It's apparent that they use a high grade of cheese on their pizzas, unlike most pizza joints in the area.  They also put a nice amount of cheese on their pizzas.  Most of the time at other places I have to order extra cheese to be satisfied, but I don't have to here. And they have slices ready most of the time that don't cost an arm and a leg.
To me, a good pizza is more than the sum of its parts. This place is probably one of only 3 or so places in town whose pizza I can honestly say fits that description.
They have over a dozen types of hard ice cream, and soft-serve vanilla and chocolate, so when I am in the area and just want some ice-cream, they are the go-to place in the Regent Square area for that.
This place is a real gem tucked away in a pleasant little spot on the corner of Forbes and Braddock.   The staff is friendly, helpful, knowledgeable, and appear to enjoy what they're doing.  So glad that I stumbled onto this place!!"}
{"text":"I stopped by with CM tonight for some pizza.  Despite living nearby, CM had never tried the pizza from here before, so I suggested we try it.  I called in our order half an hour before I planned to pick it up, and, to my surprise, they told us it would only take 10 min. to make.  So, I told them what time we would pick it up, and they said they'd have it ready for us at that time.

We ordered a small bianca pizza ($11), plus a half order of cheesy garlic bread ($1.75).  When we came by around when we said we would, our order was ready to go, and still hot.  After confirming with us that it was correct and accepting our payment, we headed back to CM's place to dig in.

The pizza was quite visually appealing, with plenty of tomato slices and basil leaves.  More importantly, it tasted as good as it looked, with a great creamy-cheesy balance between the well-seasoned ricotta sauce and the cheese on top.  Despite containing a generous amount of cheese, the pizza was not greasy at all.  The crust was on the softer side, and wasn't as crispy as I'd like, but was super filling.  The garlic bread had the same creamy-cheesy, well-seasoned topping, plus a garlicky butter sauce.  The bread itself was substantial, similar to a hoagie roll, and also very filling.  By the time I finished half the pizza and the garlic bread, I felt extremely full, as did CM.

Overall, we were very pleased with the quality of the pizza that we received from here.  As others have mentioned, the employees are very friendly, and the prices are quite reasonable.  We couldn't help but notice the wide variety of ice cream flavors available, as well as the lemon water ice, so we will surely be back to try them out.  If you live in the Regent Square area, this is a great neighborhood pizza shop offering a product superior to the chains, including Vocelli, so be sure to check it out!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! They use the best pepperoni, the small ones that get the perfect amount of crispy when cooked! Great ice cream too!"}
{"text":"I came by with my wife after a hike in Frick Park and we shared the pizza special. Got two big slices of cheese, chips, and a soda for 5.50 and I was really inpressed. Very tasty, great portion and the staff was super friendly. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Still a big fan of this shop. Owners and staff couldn't be more friendly. They have good snacks like fries and soft pretzels. NY style pizza isn't my favorite kind of pizza but they do theirs well, everything always tastes very fresh. Nice variety of ice cream flavors. Great place for a snack after playing at the park with the kiddo."}
{"text":"We like to walk down the street to get their (Hershey's) ice cream. They have standard flavors and others that rotate. Portions are generous. I can't sit inside to eat because the place smells like grease, and I wouldn't eat pizza from here, as I'm not sure hygiene is the best. (I once had to ask the server to change his gloves after handling money from a previous customer.) I'll come back for the ice cream, though, and make sure the person serving me has clean gloves on."}
{"text":"Yum!  So glad to have this place in the neighborhood, we missed our ice cream this summer.  We have enjoyed both pizza and ice cream here several times.  The pizza is very good, there are probably a few places in Pgh we like better but for the convenience (and the ice cream :) it's perfect.  They're still trying to get organized, they have ample employees but they don't have an efficient system down yet so there end up being a lot of staff confused and or getting in each others' way.  Overall we really enjoyed it and look forward to watching them grow!  Owners are super friendly and really invested."}
{"text":"Great pizza and ice cream! Great staff and reasonably priced.  Love this local pizza ice cream shop."}
{"text":"For just $5.50, we got three scoops of ice cream between the two of us. Cappuccino for me and moose tracks for him. Yum! I can see how kids would love this place because of its youthful, happy interior (yellow walls and large cartoons on the wall). They have a lot of different ice cream flavors to choose from, and their pizza isn't bad either. Everything is very reasonably priced and the workers here are super friendly! We will be coming back, especially for ice cream (even in the winter!).

{"text":"This is my go-to neighborhood pizza and ice cream joint. My boyfriend and I live about a 10 minute walk away, making it SO easy to get a pie to go when we don't feel like cooking. The pizza is always freshly made and the dough is perfectly chewy. It usually takes about 10-15 minutes for them to make a pizza, which is the perfect amount of time to grab some ice cream and people watch while your pie is being made. 

They're also totally willing to accommodate our cheese-less requests (boyfriend doesn't like cheese, the weirdo) which is always a big plus! All in all, a solid choice for pizza in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Conveniently located in the Regent Square area, this place is a great location to walk to for ice cream and pizza. It's not our favorite pizza, but when we did not receive an order as expected - it had one piece of basil on the whole pizza we were offered another pizza which was very nice of them."}
{"text":"Best pizza around! Everyone is so nice. Definitely a great experience. They have any ice cream I asked for and the pizza is very fresh. Quality shop."}
{"text":"Another great food joint in our neighborhood. Less than a five minute walk to yummy pizza and ice cream. Of course they have doggy ice cream treats that our furry guy looks forward to."}
{"text":"Good ice cream but the pizza was just ok. Not terrible, but I'd take Vocelli or any other chain over it on any day."}
