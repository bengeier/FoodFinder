{"text":"I usually enjoy my experiences at reed and co and was looking forward to a smoothie this morning on my way to work. I showed up at 840 and the door was locked. Despite that fact, the sign on the door says open and the hours listed say 8am. There was no note on the door to state why it wouldn't be open today. If I had come from somewhere far away I'd have been really upset about this. Luckily I live close by and this was a minor disappointment. However, advice to the owner, obviously emergencies happen so I hope it was nothing serious, but if it wasn't, at least post a sign explaining why you're not open during your posted hours. It's frustrating when businesses aren't reliable."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool- a healthy grab & go type of place is exactly what we need in a fast-paced world where unhealthy options are typically easier to grab when you're in a rush. When we visited on a hot afternoon, we were greeted with a free health shot- how awesome is that? The health shot was delicious and spicy- ginger, turmeric, oregano oil, and a few other ingredients that I can't quite remember. It was tasty though. They have a ton of quick snacks like granola, flax crackers, nuts, etc. that are pre-packaged and ready to grab. They also have a cooler that had some different types of oatmeal, kombucha, fresh juices, salads and they even had chocolate pudding that was made out of avocado. We decided to go with green smoothies- which were really tasty: banana, spinach, kale, coconut water, dates, and shredded coconut on top. Really refreshing on a hot day. Overall, I loved this place and am excited to come again. My hope is that they will continue to expand their menu offerings- I would love to see some wraps in the to-go cooler and hot soup in the Winter!"}
{"text":"Reed is a juice wizard.  All the stars.  Try the Green Hulk in the AM after you drop off your kids at the JCC.  In the afternoon, get some Red Drink or a Chocolate Hulk.  Plus that Mung Bean Salad.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Serious yum. Excellent service. Vegan. The \"healthy grab & go\" is definitely a niche I'm glad they're filling (since early 2017 or so). Hope they do well!   Did I mention serious yum?"}
{"text":"fantastic spot! best juices so fresh and clean, great vibes!!"}
{"text":"Very tasty, fresh food. The guy working there kept suggesting different things and I just went it. The toast with cashew cream cheese and pickled onions was a solid choice. I also downed a smoothie while waiting."}
{"text":"This review is really hard to write... I really wanted to like this place because of its amazing location, and because one of the pics of the watermelon jerky and the sweet toast another yelper posted looked DELISH! Unfortunately I came in here at 2pm on a Sunday looking to get a snack with a friend as well as start a juice cleanse (I was SO excited to finally try this place) but I walked into basically an empty refrigerator and the gentleman working saying they were sold out of a lot. I was so disappointed but i understood. I got info on a juice cleanse and made it clear to him that i really needed to start it tomorrow (Monday). He said they were currently out of bottles but that they would get them in early in the morning and that he could have it ready by 10am and he would text me if anything changes. These juice cleanses are also not cheap (it was roughly $100 for a 3 day cleanse). I was fine with 10am but if you are familiar with juice cleanses, you have to start early and can't eat in the morning...   Come Monday morning, around 9:50 as I am driving away from my house I get a text saying it wasn't going to be ready but that he could have it dropped off when it was. I was annoyed but decided that i was just going to have to start my juice cleanse on Tuesday. I went in at 230pm to pick up and the owner was there (not the gentleman from the night before) and when I said i was picking up and gave her my name, she looked at my like I had 4 heads. She had no idea about my order which the guy made me pay for on Sunday because he said that they were having a slow day (yet you were sold out of everything?) She found the receipt and said she was going to pull it but at this point i was so annoyed by the lack of communication between the team there, organization and the operations issues this business is having where it actually is going to impact sales.   I told her I wanted a refund because I didn't have time to wait and to be honest it really should have been there and set aside so it could be seamless and i could grab it and go. After she did the refund the guy walked in and she mentioned to him about the order and he said \"oh I'll pull it\" and she explained how she already gave me a refund. Him and i ended up talking and he agreed with everything I said.   I ended up going down the street to Pittsburgh Juice Company where I had a phenomenal experience. They gave me juices so that I could start my cleanse that day, and then had me come back the following day to pick up the remaining two days so i didn't have to start my cleanse Tuesday due to my event. That's what a solution minded team should do when faced with challenges and obstacles in a business, even if it is your competition who made the mistake."}
{"text":"They have some great things on the menu. I've been here three times. I want to like and support this place but here's why I can't.... they often don't have the things on the menu that I want. I actually notice that they have a fraction of the things on the menu. Hard to run a business without product. It's a shame.  I'll also add in, while no one has been rude or unfriendly, it peeves me when I they are out of things or when I've asked for additional info about ingredients (like what's in your jam) the response is an apathetic 'I'm sorry' that isn't genuine or warm. Overall my assessment is that this is a good concept but it's not customer focused, i.e. not enough product and not a careful or compassionate apology or rationale from the staff.  Good luck getting what you want of you go.  If you luck out you'll likely be happy but with the pain of parking in the area and so many other options, I'll not make another attempt. This was strike three for me.  If you go I recommend the oatmeal. I do not recommend the trail mix. Totally overrated."}
{"text":"The chocolate cashew milk is amazing...and there's no sugar!  Staff is fabulous to boot!"}
{"text":"As a fellow juice bar owner, I'm always seeking out to support other juice bars to see what they have and to support the mission of health and wellness. Both of the juices that I tried were delicious. Also had two of the ready to go little lunches and they were both fantastic. The owner was super friendly and the atmosphere was bright and cheerful. Really like this place and will be back next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Proceed with caution! There is a 95% chance they are out of whatever you're trying to order. This place is great but some times I wonder why things are on the menu if they never have it. Used to be my go-to spot but it's so rare they actually have what I want to order in stock."}
{"text":"Super cool laid back juice bar. Visited on a Monday and the juice was extremely fresh! He scooped out the juice into a container, it was just made! I got the Sweet Beets and also got the Super Citrus. The citrus one is AMAZING!!!! Anyone would love it!! I'm a huge beer lover so I LOVE the beet one I chose! I know some people aren't a fan. A must try!"}
{"text":"Painfully overpriced for disgustingly average food.   The food wasn't bad but for 13$ you would expect a higher quality I would pay maybe 6$ for the burger w bacon and no fries.  For that price fries should be included.  if your trying to spend money on vegetarian spak bros is a much better bang for buck.  For the actual dish I think it had a bit to much onion and the lettuce had a weird cut to it ??"}
{"text":"I have to be honest, I did not enjoy my experience here. Upon walking in the girl working was so unhappy. She offered no direction or help. Not even a smile or a hi. Second, their shelves were pretty much empty leaving me with about 3 juice choices. The one I got literally tasted like pickle juice and I threw it out after 1 sip. $6 down the drain. The whole experience I could have done without."}
{"text":"Reed is great.  The juice is delicious and every time I go in he teaches me something new that makes me healthier. The food is good the juice and health shot always makes me feel better if I have a slight cold coming on.  The design of his place is great too, especially the flooring.  :-)   love everything about this place.  He even got my dad drinking beet juice, and he hates beets.  That's how good his stuff is"}
{"text":"I cannot express how much I love this place. It is seriously the best. The team that works there are really sweet. The best part though is how knowledgeable the staff is. They really know their stuff when it comes down to it.   Juices:  Orange: grapefruit, orange, turmeric, pineapple, lime, mint, and Himalayan salt.  This was awesome when I was having a little bit of a down day. I wanted a pick me up and OJ is usually my drink of choice when I feel something brewing. This drink was great. Fresh and yum. The taste was just like homemade.   White: raw cashews, Silk cashew milk, deglet dates, vanilla, coconut flake, cinnamon, maple, Himalayan salt, Oat water. Weird, right? Try it. You will not be disappointed. It was probably my favorite out of all the drinks that I sampled there. It just had the weirdest flavor but I wanted to keep on drinking it!   Health Shot:  Because I ordered two juices I got a health shot for free!  Turmeric,  ginger, lemon, cayenne, and oil of oregano. I will say that this cleared up my sinuses for a bit. I will also say that the oil of oregano I was tasting for a few hours after the shot was taken. It kept on coming up and tasting it in my mouth. But it helped enough that it was worth it.   The grab and go drinks are also affordable and on point. My favorite is the NOOMA organic electrolyte drink. Six ingredients, all good for you. The one that I like the most is the Watermelon Lime. I cannot get enough of it! The blueberry mint was ok, but not as good as the watermelon.   Go here and meet the staff, grab some juices, and get in to the goodness. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"If you are vegan or like vegan then this is the place for you. When I arrived, I learned about their concept. Not only do they specialize in cold pressed raw juice but they also make juice cleansers as well. If you like vegan milk they sell that in containers made with nuts instead of any type of milk.  Although the place is mostly take out, there is a ledge facing the outside if you would rather stand and not deal with the harsh weather. In addition they will give you free \"shots\" if you wish to sample a vegan juice.  Most foods are refrigerated and I saw they sell a vegan chili for $4.00. After sampling the sweet beet red juice, I decided to go with that one and since I noticed the parfaits were a big hit got one of them too.  The lady was kind enough to serve it to me in a recyclable cup. The juice contains beet, carrot, pineapple, pear, orange, ginger and lemon. It was quite good and I could feel the benefits of having something healthy.  The dairy free yogurt parfait is made with soy yogurt, local granola, almond clusters, strawberries, and blueberries. I really enjoyed this treat since this parfait wasn't overly filling as most are but was just enough for me.  90% of their food is vegan, however, the do sell Commonplace coffee and Gryphon's tea there as well. Many of their items are gluten free as well.  For water they offer free Ion water. If you wish to have some to keep you may bring a container and then they will fill it for you complimentary.  The staff is very knowledgeable and helpful in explaining things to me. This is a nice tiny grab and go located in the heart of central Lawrenceville on Butler St across from PNC bank. Metered street parking is available or if you are lucky and willing to walk you can park on a side street for a limited time.  Expect to pay more here because you are getting quality. For me, it's worth going the extra mile for."}
{"text":"OMG I love this place! It's a perfect grab and go joint with delicious and healthy options. So the three juice available on my visit were red (beets and other veggies), green (with kale and more) and my favorite which was the orange (layered citrus with what I believe had mint as well).  I sampled the red and green and though typically not ingredients I go crazy for, they were yummy and I would order them on a future visit. The orange blew me away. It was so refreshing and full of flavor. It's everything I want when drinking juice. The taste just bursts in my mouth.  I'd been waiting for this opening and I can see I'm not at all disappointed. Next time around I would like to try a smoothie and maybe a salad or soup. They have other things like fresh fruit and oatmeal too. You can get Commonplace Coffee and Gryphon Tea here as well."}
