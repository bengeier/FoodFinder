{"text":"delicious general tao, great service. love ordering and dining in 
it's a hidden gem. their soups are amazing too"}
{"text":"To me, I generally rate a place by how much pride they take in the general quality, freshness and consistency of their plates. Fang Chi nails this for me. This is a rare quality for a cheap Montreal Schzechuan restaurant....especially off the beaten track! They care about their food, how it tastes and looks, and it shows.
This is what an inexpensive, tasty and good quality Chinese restaurant should be...take note! I really like this place, and its me and my bf's fave order-in available in St-Henri (not that we have much choice). 
Vegetarian general Tao and fried bananas for desert are my special treat!"}
{"text":"Good place to have lunch at, meal was satisfying. Be sure to order the salt and pepper shrimps since that is one of their best tasting dishes."}
{"text":"Chantonese Cow Mein anyone?

You read right.  This place is so good it has me tongue-tied.  From the General Tao to the Peanut butter dumplings, hot and sour soup, chicken in red curry, orange beef ...oh yeah awesome. 
Seriously, I order from this place at least once a week,and if you order from the combination menu you get a main, a won ton soup, rice and spring roll for $9.95!

Trust me, once you try it you might be saying Duhan Humplings.

fuggedaboutit!"}
{"text":"My wife enjoys Sichuan hot dishes, so I order a beef grilled with onion on iron plate and take it to home. Although it is a little bit different from those authentic things in China, but we really like it. 
A gentlemen cooked the plate and served us. He is really nice.
Just the meaning of the business name in Chinese is confusable. \"\" usually refers to those businesses in red light neighbourhoods."}
{"text":"Best salt and pepper shrimps! Delicious, cheap and good service! Usualy its emply because most people order take out! Always fresh and apparently the general tao is amazing"}
{"text":"I've ordered before from Fang Chi but never the nightmare we experienced this week. I've been the their establishment (a rinky dink hole in the wall) and the service was fine, food passable. BUT our delivery service this time was terrible. 
1. Wonton's in the soup were of very poor quality - low in taste and too much dough.
2. Our delivery man arrived with our ordered food containers ON THEIR SIDES and everything was spilled. One of the containers had melted and all it's contents oozed out. Not cool and no apology was offered either.
3. Food was just awful. Poor quality ingredients. Peanut chicken was supposed to be spicy: hardly any peanut flavour and no spice. Garlic shrimp was meh and deep fried?? Sautéed veg had no flavour but lots of oil. Best thing on my plate was the broth from my soup!

I can't say more - crossed off our list forever.  I want to support my local restos but I have to make an exception."}
{"text":"Fang Chi is a family run restaurant located at 3967 St. Antoine Street West in a residential area of St. Henri. It is not well served by public transportation so if you intend to dine at this establishment the best mode of transport to get to the restaurant is automobile. Apparently, this establishment is a well kept secret for those in the know about great Asian cuisine at reasonable prices in Montreal. Upon dining here I would agree with this assessment.

I dined at this restaurant with a group of five and enjoyed the experience very much. We arrived at about 6 on a Saturday night to what appeared to be a restaurant that was just opening for business for the evening. There were no other patrons but it quickly filled up diners. I liked  the ambiance of this restaurant very much. It was a dimly lit and cozy intimate setting, perfect for our group. 

I opted for the four course Cashew chicken meal daily special. This meal included a green tea,  a won ton soup, spring roll, and the main dish (Cashew Chicken) all for the price of a little over $10.00, tip not included. The won ton soup was excellent, probably one of the best I ever tasted. The spring roll was great as well and was very crisp served with a very sweet plum sauce. The main course was delicious with a sweet sauce and lots of fresh steamed broccoli, green and red peppers, chicken and cashews, served with a dollop of steamed white rice.

I would recommend this restaurant for anyone who likes a restaurant that has very good quality fresh Asian dishes at a reasonable price. The specials of the day are highly recommended for those who are budget conscious. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Perfection! This hidden gem that has been here for years is truly \"As good as it gets!\". The orange beef is filled with beautiful and toothsome orange pieces. My partner swears by their General Tao and has his entire office hooked. They no longer order '\"Chinese\", they order \"Fang Chi\". The variety and number of dishes available will please your taste buds and your wallet. The cashew chicken is filled with surprises as their simple won-ton soup is (actually) filled with won-ton! A must try are their fried bananas for dessert. Their delivery range is small(ish) but you can always pick-up tremendous meals to take home."}
{"text":"Fang Chi was a nice surprise for me.  I stopped by here for dinner on my first night in town, directly after dropping my stuff off at the loft and checking Yelp for a good restaurant.  After looking at the menu, I decided to eat at the restaurant rather than take it back to the loft, so I sat down and was treated to a complimentary pot of hot green tea.  The General Tao chicken (so ordered based on the previous reviews) was a huge platter of breaded and fried chicken soaking in a delicious dark sauce.  I didn't expect it to be breaded, since when I usually get it elsewhere it isn't, but the flavor was definitely there (although the spice was conspicuously absent; perhaps the little chili should be removed from beside the item description on the menu) and I managed to suppress the guilt of eating a huge platter of fried stuff.  The white rice was a perfect consistency for chopsticks, although there were no chopsticks at the table.

The second visit was a take-out order of Szechuan Beef with white rice and a side order of the Hunan Dumplings (again, credit goes to previous reviews for this selection).  The beef was, as with the chicken previously, flavorful and delicious -- but again, lacking the heat implied by that little chili next to the description.

The Hunan Dumplings... well, I think I actually saw stars when I bit into the first one.  Admittedly, I'm a sucker for a good peanut sauce.  Put me in any decent Thai or Vietnamese restaurant with summer rolls on the menu, and after I've finished devouring them a trained eye might see an expression come across my face as I consider whether or not it would be considered bad manners to just grab the little bowl of peanut sauce and lick it clean.

Those dumplings are what dreams are made of. Delicious, flavorful, sticky, peanut-flavored dreams."}
{"text":"You can hear the sizzling woks in the kitchen cooking delectable dishes. General Tao - one of the best I've had. Lo Mein noodles were also excellent. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I'm just visiting Montreal - from Vancouver - where I eat various Chinese cuisine a couple times a week on average.  

I ordered from Fang Chi from the good reviews on Yelp and its the first time Yelp has disappointed.  Perhaps it is an interpretation of how ethnic foods are cooked - West coast from here - I have noticed this before, and was prepared to make allowances.

I had my food delivered - it arrived quickly, was decent sized for the price and it was hot.  That is the good.

The bad is simply the taste, or lack of taste.  

The worst was the Won Ton Soup - flavourless broth, I added soy and pepper to make it better, but one bite of the won ton and I spit it out.  I'm not sure if it was a big ball of dough or if it just tasted that way.  It was tasteless, rubbery and disgusting.  No clue if it even had meat.  Seriously bad.

Next was the Chow Mein.  It was the rare kind of chow mein without noodles - first time I've encountered this and had to look it up (on Wikipedia) to confirm that was indeed a type available only in parts of Eastern Canada.  Sorry, I prefer the noodles.  It was pretty much tasteless, too much bean sprouts, chicken was cooked fine but really could not taste it.  There could have been more vegetables within as well.

Chicken Fried Rice was fine - tasteless though.  Ditto on the Breaded Shrimps.

Funny, the Dry Honey Garlic Spareribs were anything but dry - it was floating in sauce.  Oddly, this was the favourite of my wife's, I thought the meat too chewy.

I looked on the Fang Chi site to see if they were one of the non-MSG or organic/healthy restaurants (you can find in Vancouver) - which would help explain the lack of flavour - but saw little evidence of that.  It was just a bad meal."}
{"text":"Nice place, horrible decoration. Great place if you don't want to cook, nothing special about the food, it's classic fast food Chinese. Very nice staff and they have some nice combo."}
{"text":"Ce restaurant asiatique à une décoration tellement laide que je ris dans ma barbe à chaque fois. Par contre l'apparence cache souvent une surprise. La nourriture est excellente et les prix sont abordables. Malheureusement le service est souvent très lent sur l'heure du dîner (12:00 à 13:00 pm). Pour environ 8$ vous avez un rouleau de printemps avec une sauce maison, une soupe won ton et du thé chinois, ainsi que le repas principal qui est très gros. J'ai souvent de la difficulté à finir mon assiette. Les gens commandent souvent le général tao mais je recommande les vermicelles au style singapourien ou bien le Chow Mein."}
{"text":"You Pay Now!

   This is my go to for Szechuanne and Thai. When I first walked in to ask for a delivery menu I could barely understand what the very kind people were saying. I though to myself \"my God, Matthew, order this food immediately!\". I have never looked back.

  They have a great $9.30 special that gets you a main, soup, eggroll and rice. Irrefutably, one of the best deals in town. The Hunan dumplings are awesome as is the Cantonese chow mein and Won Ton soup. They even put cabbage in the soup with scallions for a nice crunch.

  Fantastic

  You'll thank me later

{"text":"This place is exactly everything you're hoping for when it comes to Chinese take-out: inexpensive, tasty and plentiful. It's also a good ol' family establishment which is nice. The restaurant itself looks like a gutted-out basement from the 70s, complete with wood panelling and an old van seat in the corner (?). Needless to say, I prefer to just get take-out or delivery. The food is actually pretty exceptional- ingredients are fresh and the quality is consistently awesome. My only real piece of advice is to plan for leftovers, you're going to be eating that fried rice for three days."}
