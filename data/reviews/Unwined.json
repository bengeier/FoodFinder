{"text":"Enjoyed an outstanding meal at Unwined this evening.  The Surf & Turf (filet and scallops) was the perfect entree for two to share.  The mashed potatoes and asparagus were perfect sides.  We enjoyed a glass of California Cab that was a great selection!  The ambience was very welcoming and friendly.  Great service!"}
{"text":"Short and not so sweet...  Service, all talk no knowledge.  Food, far under par.  The decor was the only reason I gave 1 star."}
{"text":"Wow - 3rd time, not a charm.  I know the restaurant was recently taken over.  We got there 10 min before happy hour was over on a Wednesday night.  There was no music on in the background.  Waited 5 minutes to get a menu, ordered a wine and a drink.  If you are advertising a wine bar, at least pour more than 3-4 oz.  You won't get repeat business!  Next was the menu - ordered the bruschetta (very small) and cheese plate which were good.  My husband asked what the fish of the day and the pasta of the day were.  We were told they were out - it was 7:00pm!  That means to me - they didn't want to bother that day since the dinner menu started at 5 and it wasn't busy.  We ordered the NOLA BBQ Shrimp.  The shrimp was tasty.  The jambalaya farro had absolutely zero flavor, not just no jambalaya flavorings but a little salt would have helped!  My husband ordered another jack and diet coke.  They ran out, the server suggested Jim Beam.  A little server education would be appropriate here....  So he looked over at the bar and ordered Knob Creek, straight up.  He was given it in some type of glass, a little bigger than a shot glass, and only 1 finger.  A $10 drink for less than an oz pour?  This isn't a chain restaurant.  You have to do better than this to stay in business.  I live very close and won't be back!"}
{"text":"Service was good. We were immediately brought to our table and the bartender was very attentive. He immediately told us about their happy hour specials, which I found rather refreshing, since I usually have to ask. Happy hour wines were a bit pricey. The house wines and pinot grigio's were not included. Happy hour will basically get you $9 a glass. Beer was a better deal at $4-$6. I ordered 4  bruschetta for $12 which is a pretty decent bargain these days. Upon reading the menu the ingredients sounded very promising but there was a complete lack of execution. First off, the reuben bruschetta was just odd. It was smeared with russian, a minimal amount of sauerkraut and huge chunks of corned beef cover in melted swiss. This bruschetta would have bode well served as more of an open face sandwich with sliced corned beef and would have had more coverage of all ingredients. Next up was the Arizona. It boasted bacon, sautéed mushrooms and onions with ricotta. There was no depth of flavor due to the complete lack of any salt or acid. A little bit of balsamic reduction would have cut through the fats on this bruschetta nicely and heightened the flavor profiles of all the ingredients. The salmon bruschetta came out and was pretty good. It had cut up capers which I don't know why you wouldn't put whole and they substituted weird small diced pickle/cucumber pieces. It tasted more like a dill pickle relish. They should have done either fresh tomatoes or sun dried tomatoes with the salmon. Sometimes you just don't have to try and reinvent the classic. The last was prosciutto with marscarpone and fig. I am never a fan of this one, but actually tasted alright. The biggest issue with the bruschetta was the thickness and texture of the bread. It was too thin, to the point it would bend when lifted with the ingredients on it and honestly tasted like it was toasted yesterday. So it was left with a crispy crust but stale tasting texture. Imagine when a crispy cracker goes stale and this was kinda the same. The worst part of the entire experience was we went to a wine bar for some peace and quiet to get away from our kids and there were 4 kids sitting in the bar area!!! I have no problem with kids, but a bar at happy hour is no place for them and takes away from the ambiance and experience of the rest of the patrons. At one point the waitress had to go clean up a broken glass created from one of the kids, so you could imagine the noise level the were cheating. I have a culinary background and I understand the bar can't control patrons, but maybe make the bar area 21 and over, just a suggestion.  I would go back again and try them out as I know every cook has an off day, but I won't expect much more than we received  the first time. And it's rather unfortunate cause its a quaint little place inside and I thought I had found my new diamond in the rough!"}
{"text":"Great food and awesome service with new owners.

Love the wine flights and creative appetizer plates!"}
{"text":"Went here with a groupon and had fabulous service and food! The owners came to our table and spoke to us and told us all about upcoming events there. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ritz crackers?!?! Wow. Just wow. Cheddar cheese platter came with ritz. I wanted it to be better but I can't believe ritz crackers. Sorry guys but no. No. No."}
{"text":"Resident of Ahwatukee for 9 years, pleased to patronize a favorite restaurant in Ahwatukee and wish there were others without having to drive a distance out to Tempe or Mesa.  I have absolutely no idea how this restaurant garnered 4+ stars.  Quality and service was lousy.  I'm a gourmand myself, even recognizing fresh, least adulterated as soon as it hits my palate. A treat to eat our in the neighborhood from my cooking Asian fusion at home 90% of the time. Although most restaurants here pale in comparison to any near Puget Sound in WA or in San Francisco, my hubby and I found this restaurant completely unacceptable, in fact, it so bad it left me irritable the rest of the evening and into the next morning.  How so?
1. It's still winter in February.  We both select Autumn Stew, but waiter tells us it's no longer available.
2. I ask if salmon is farm raised or wild caught.  Waiter excuses himself to find out and returns with Wild Caught answer.
3. We each select an alternative entree with vegetable and side dinner salad.  30 minutes later, waiter tells us chef not pleased with vegetable and chose to use another.
4. More waiting, at least 15 minutes longer before entrees come and arrive without salad we ordered that could have come long before dinner entrees!  Asparagus meager, entrees of salmon and pork loin were dried out, as if on a hot plate or burner for hours, and VERY salty.
ADVICE:  If you want a reliable local Ahwatukee restaurant to eat in, choose Pear Bistro just across the way, or even Denny's the opposite direction on Chandler across I-10."}
{"text":"just shared a bottle of La Fin Du Monde. Great food, rotating craft beers and 50 wines and owners and staff that learn your name and treat you like family. you're crazy if this isn't a regular hangout for you. it is for me."}
{"text":"Well, all I can really say is that this place has plenty of room for improvement. Went for happy hour and it was Ridiculously overpriced coupled with subpar food. Ordered the green chili hummus and it was SO salty I could not even eat it. Also, ordered the salmon cakes that were $10 (happy hour mind you) came out the size of a half dollar... What a joke. One perk was that our server was nice and friendly. I doubt I will ever go back."}
{"text":"I really like this place! Great happy hour specials from 11am-6pm EVERY DAY, and open later than most places in Ahwatukee. Also a little classier than some of the other nearby options. Very cute decor and relaxing atmosphere. Great for a date night or girls' night out, but I've seen families with young children there, too. 
I've not yet tried any of the entrees, but I liked the appetizers and salads that I've tried quite a bit. The kale salad and diver scallops are to die for. The bruschettas are ok - the apple pecan and brie is a little bland but the fig jam is very good. The green chile hummus is also delicious.
The service was prompt and friendly. We've never had to wait to be seated.
I really hope this place sticks around for a long time!"}
{"text":"I went here on Wednesday completely unaware that it was ladies night which makes drinks and glasses of wine 1/2 off. It would be rather pricy though without the  1/2 off.  For example: the cheapest wine flight is $21, but they do special promotions many nights. Tuesday is wine tasting and Thursday is 1/2 off bottles night. I sat at the bar and the bartenders were attentive and fun. They changed out my wine glass every time I ordered a different wine. I have no other word for the caprese than PERFECT; the balsamic reduction was fabulous!!!!!!!!!!!!! Whenever I'm up in Phoenix, I am definitely coming back. I can't wait to try out their wine tasting."}
{"text":"Phenomenal wines, unconscionably good charcuterie, knowledgeable staff, a wonderful experience!!! 
I got the groupon for a wine flight and the charcuterie board. It was nothing if not a magical evening. 
A tip, you'll want more bread."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. love the cozy sitting area in the back. staff was Nice ans responsive.  didn't eat on this trip but will be back"}
{"text":"I was so excited a wine bar was coming to The Foothills!  Unwined needs improvement... 
The wine was tasty but pricey.  It also took 20 min to get our 1st glass which was unacceptable. Kale salad was delicious. The only really bright spot of my experience. Bruschetta was just bad! I ordered brie and pesto. Most of it went in the garbage!"}
{"text":"Must have been an \"off\" night (Saturday). Service was great..food not so much. Had the Paella and it was served in a 5\" cast iron skillet; maybe a half cup of oven baked rice, so crispy the edges were charred and floating in butter (to soften it?) Very over done; my husband thought it was leftover rice reheated. Three shrimp, two mussels, two clamsand one was empty. Drove 70 miles, wish we'd gone to La Comida a couple doors down."}
{"text":"I have gone to Unwined twice so far and love it. The bruschetta is great. I love the unique combinations they offer. The hummus was great. The only thing is they need to work on their staff. I know they are new and it can be hard to get a full staff you can trust to show up nut the first time we went there we were waited on by a hostess who knew nothing about the menu due to none of their servers showing up for work. The manager came over and explained the situation when he took our drink order and we told him it was ok. Then he seemed to forget about us and took about 20 minutes to bring our bottle of wine we ordered. This was a slow Monday and there were maybe two other tables in the whole place. It shouldn't take that long to grab a bottle and two glasses. They have something really good here I just hope they don't ruin it with bad staff. The second time was better but still very slow service for how empty the place was. I recommend checking them out but don't go if your in a hurry."}
{"text":"Fantastic service 
Excellent ambience 
Unbelievable food (especially for someone who is an extremely picky eater) 
All of my out of town guests will be coming here because it is a gem in the foot hills.
We wanted to do 4 stars because we don't want the place to get too crowded but that wouldn't be fair to you or the fantastic staff.
Enjoy! And cheers :)"}
{"text":"Stopped in to check out the place and fell in love with it.... The service was fantastic, everybody was so nice, I love the decore and the lighting  (most places are too bright), the food was great and reasonably priced...and to my surprise when I ordered dessert and coffee   they brought out fresh delicious coffee in a coffee press ...last and certainly not least they had a fantastic band called Notes from Neptune with a sax  and guitar, they did some John Legend, Sting, Prince, Alicia Keys... Wow.... I will definitely come back and bring friends!!!"}
{"text":"This is a neat little spot. Server was super friendly and helpful! Food was upscale type bar food, it's definitely worth the stop."}
{"text":"I really liked the food and the wine. The happy hour specials were great. We had the bruschetta and it was amazing. The pear, honey and Brie is to die for! The only complaint I had was the music was a little loud the night we visited. Otherwise I loved it!  We will be back!  The decorations inside were beautiful."}
{"text":"I love That we have a nice place to eat and have wine around the corner from my house. We were skeptical as the places that have been in this spot before Unwined have not been very good. We went for drinks and apps to check it out with our one year old. They even had high chairs. I was surprised. I ordered wine and my husband ordered beer.The server was nice and brought the drinks promptly. It was happy hour so the beers were 4 dollars and the wines were 5 dollars. We then ordered bruschetta and hummus with pita. The food was fairly good. And we ended up having to chug our drinks because my one year old finished eating bruschetta and then had a meltdown. We will definitely go again."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant a few years ago when they were under the former owners, but haven't had a chance until today to check it out under the new owners. I stopped in this afternoon for Happy Hour. 

The wine selection is very good, but I was quite disappointed in the quality of the food. We ordered two different bruschetta options, and each was essentially tasteless. We also ordered a shrimp cocktail, which consisted of four medium shrimp, served with some dipping sauces. Not a good deal for $9.00 (more than $2.50 per medium shrimp...yikes!).  Also, the shrimp were served at room temperature, which was concerning. We mentioned that to our waiter, who said he would \"let the chef know\". But there was no follow-up.  Given that there were only a few tables occupied, it seemed like a miss that they wouldn't have someone from the kitchen/management circle back on the complaint. I live in Ahwatukee and love to patronize local businesses, but this one was a disappointment. Gave two stars only because the wine selection was good. Next time I will eat somewhere else first."}
{"text":"We stopped for a quick bite and the food was amazing, much better than we expected.  My husband ordered the scallop risotto and he was thrilled, said it was the best risotto he has ever had.  Happy hours prices were good and service was great.  I hope this place stays around a long time."}
{"text":"I attended a private event here and I was very unhappy with the service and the staff.  The event had over 120 people and they didn't have enough staff hired to accommodate.  Dinner took over an hour to be served the guests with the food then being cold.  The staff was often rude at times when asked a question or requesting something.  I'm sure this place could be good when it's just a regular restaurant but as a place to host a private event they failed!! 
Wouldn't recommend it at all."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Sat. night about 3 weeks ago and headed right to the bar. Sat there for a good 10-15 min. with both bartenders looking at me but not acknowledging me. Finally, one says \"did you want to order something?\" .... I said \"that was the plan\" and then he says \"oh, why didn't the hostess give you a menu? I hate it when they do that\".... Ok, I've walked into a lot of restaurants and headed right to the bar and Never has a hostess chased me down to give me a menu... It was a lame excuse to make up for the fact that I was being ignored. Ordered a glass of wine and the Meat & Cheese board, nothing special."}
{"text":"We're loving the entire experience! Music, good food and wine! The oven roasted chicken was moist and delicious and the salmon salad was yum!"}
{"text":"I almost never write bad reviews but unfortunately that is what has to be done here. I will say this is not against the food or wine list, which were both good. However, I'm not sure I ever had worse service by a waiter and owner in all my life!! Me and 6 friends decided to try this place out for happy hour on Friday January 22nd 2016. We sat at the community table. We ordered some glasses of wine and some appetizers. The bruschetta was good, not as good as Postino's or Vintage 95 wine bars, but it was a solid \"good\". The green chile hummus was also good. The wine list was vast and the reds we ordered were perfect temperature (slightly cooled). Because it was a casual happy hour, we didn't order our entrees until about 30 minutes after our arrival. About 40 mins AFTER we ordered the entrees, I asked the waiter to please check on them. He did and said it would be 5 more minutes. About 30 mins later the entree's FINALLY came out and he apologized and said they'd give us a free dessert for the inconvenience. When we got our checks, I requested ONE of their Smores dessert (for 7 of us mind you!) and 7 spoons. He came back a few minutes later and set our check down and said they were out of that dessert. When I grabbed the menu to choose something else, he said \"oh she's not going to give you anything else\" and just walked away mid-sentence. I was stunned as were the rest of my group. I don't know who \"she\" was, so I asked the bartender for a manager and about 5 mins later the owner, a gentleman, came over. He was not friendly nor apologetic and just kept saying that his orders were going out within 12-14 minutes all night. I told him I'm sure they were, had the order actually been placed (our waiter seemed absent minded to say the least). I told him that the waiter also gave my friend the wrong glass of wine, then when we ordered a couple different bottles he poured the wrong bottle into my glass which still had 1/2 of a completely different wine in it! (thankfully I'm not that picky but a wine snob would have freaked lol) and the fact that he offered a dessert then took it away, was completely rude and unprofessional. The owner proceeded to be defensive and told me he would reprimand the waiter and walked away. NO offer of a coupon or something complimentary the next time we visited, NO insistence of taking a dessert at that time, nothing! I cannot see how an owner would not offer some sort of compensation of food (which costs them very little) or a discount in order to make good on a bad experience that could have been easily avoided with a waiter who was able to do their job. I can say I likely will not go back. The entrees were good, again, nothing over the top, but solid...but with that sort of attitude and service, I'll go spend hundreds somewhere else! (Yes, we spent several hundred dollars for this service!). A big thumbs down sad to say."}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped by for Happy Hour and some dinner last week. Very nice bar area, open, inviting and classy. The Happy Hour specials were very nice. We were able to get a great bottle of wine for $18.

We ordered two different types of the bruschetta both were outstanding. We also enjoyed the Mahi panini, delicious. 

We were invited to attend wine classes later this month. The classes were reasonably prices and we are looking forward to attending.

Overall we will surely be returning. Great little spot tucked away in the Foothills."}
{"text":"This is the cutest and most quaint place in the foothills, in my opinion. A hidden gem!
Good live music, good vibe, good food, good wine, and good service! Give it a try! Owners are usually on the premises and are there to serve you. That says a lot. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Came in for some wine to celebrate my birthday. Our server had no idea what he was doing, on top of being creepy. Older guy, lacking in experience or customer service. I asked about a rose. He said he had a French one from Germany, ummmm??? My husband who knows wine asked him a question and he was clueless. I get there's a lot to know about wine but if you don't know go ask someone. We left after one glass bc it just wasn't a good experience"}
{"text":"Not inexpensive but great staff, great experience, live music on Friday night was awesome, and the food was fresh and delicious. Cory did an excellent job tonight. 
Tukee burger was perfect!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service and atmosphere. Our server was Alex and she was attentive and very helpful. Ordered Bacon Blue Cheese burger which was delicious. 
Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went here for my friend's birthday I looked at the menu a week ago & was nervous cause it was a picture of the menu with a border never seen a restaurant do this. Looked at the options & the waiter took everyone's order left before asking me & never came back... I finally flagged down another waiter all I ordered was a bowl of fries that took over an hour while people were having burgers with the side of fries I say there starving every one who ordered the chicken or turkey complained that it wasn't season & taste like it was frozen  a lady came out said she was the owner & if it was too dry that they should have put some sauce on it and that she had never had any complaints. The band was the best part of the evening. I also had to beg them to bring take my payment because they forgot about me again. The shrimp cocktail is 4 medium sized shrimp with 3 sauces. It's not worth your money or time"}
{"text":"Meh. $15 a glass for a $19 (retail) bottle of wine?  I'll give it another go when they have a few more months under their belt."}
{"text":"Super disappointed! Saw all the great reviews so we finally decided to check it out.  Atmosphere is great.  Managers check tables often and are very friendly.  This was a plus...HOWEVER...our server was very slow and totally lacking energy.  She was so disengaged that our table wondered why she even showed up to work.  Then our food came out.  I ordered the smoked salmon bruschetta.  It was ok, but for the price, too disappointing.  It looked like canned tuna.  Actually, I'm fairly certain they used canned salmon.  I expected fresh slices of smoked salmon, not overpriced canned food.  We paid $50 for TWO appetizers and a couple drinks each.  Too much for two people for happy hr!!!  Will not go back."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a beer before dinner and I was pleasantly surprised. Good beer selection and nice menu. We only had snacks but I look forward to dining. The price point is a bit high for the neighborhood I would say."}
{"text":"We have only been once but plan to go back for the live music. Our service was spot on. Red wine flight was fabulous. They had a good beer selection. Food was great. I liked the ambiance as well. I would like to go back again when the weather cools down to enjoy their patio."}
{"text":"Let me start with RAVE reviews for the staff.  We stopped by last night (Fri) at 7:30 and the place was packed. We were informed that this was a 'soft opening' but the buzz is clearly out there. They don't even have the sign up over the door yet. 

From the moment we stepped in, the front desk staff were informative, attentive and offered great suggestions for food.  Our server (Nikki) was efficient and suggested 3 really good wines to go with our food.  They were out of a few food items and the staff was very apologetic about it. We had no trouble making a couple selections from what they still had.   

I ordered the green apple and fennel salad and will make the drive back there just for that item alone. Cheers to the creator of that mix of sweet, tart and crunchy goodness!  Then we tried the braised beef Panini. Beef was melt in your mouth but I'd suggest taking that out of the panini and giving it a place of honor on top of a pile of mashed potatoes with a veggie side. My companions ordered the Caprese Salad and rated it 'good' because after tasting my Apple Fennel salad, well, nothing was as good as that. 

This place is way out in the foothills and a bit beyond my normal HH range but I'll be back again in a few weeks to see how they are doing."}
{"text":"Went here on Labor Day weekend,  Saturday night. It wasn't too crowded.  We got a nice spot in the back on some nice couches. The waiter was very friendly and informative.  We tried some wine and dessert.  It's a little pricey, but we will be back.  Overall a really good experience."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  The food is phenomenal and the service wonderful.  Bartenders great and they have live music too.  Great location for Ahwatukee folks.  Family friendly too."}
{"text":"Nice cozy location with a good crowd. Have bee told that business has picked up in the past 2 weeks.  Decor is inviting and warm. Drinks are poured on the the strong side,  which is desirable. The menu looks varied and has some interesting items. Happy Hour is from 3-7 PM Dailey.  They are billed as a wine bar but they have a full bar.  Didn't have any of the menu items this visit. 

Service was a little slow on this visit. Not sure if they had an unexpected large crowd. 

It will take another visit to adequately evaluate this place."}
{"text":"We had a Local Flavor coupon in which we got 3 wine flights apiece and the meat and cheese board...First of all, Tracy was wonderful in helping us choose wines and food...The flights were very generous and we ordered 2 bruschettas and the seared diver scallops to share...Everything was delicious!  I would like to come back for the filet and scallop..."}
{"text":"A great find! Very attentive staff. Delicious bruschetta combinations. The meat, cheese and fruit plate has a nice variety. The lunch and dinner menu has a nice variety. The happy hour menu is a great value. Wish it had a location in Chandler but worth the drive to the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"First visit with a gal pal we ordered HH wine, olives (yum) and hummus plate which was very tasty and had sufficient veggie & pita to help us enjoy every last bite.  Pleasant, reasonably priced experience. Nice Server!

Second visit with Spouse. Tried the  \"Killer Martini\" and discovered I am a gin-lover!
Warm Kale salad was really super flavorful and the kale was clean (no grit) and very lightly dressed as it should be. Just right amount of cranberries & pine nuts to offset
DrumRoll PLEASE....the Scallops (2)  tender, cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly I was very pleasantly surprised and happy!

Spouse had the only \"man-food\" on the menu (he assures me he read it twice).  Hamburger was good and he wouldn't mind coming back BUT he would love to see more man-food offerings please.   Again with the Nice Servers and the background music was so soothing and pleasant."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised, and I'm very hopeful for this place!

After seeing a handful of restaurants come and go in this location, I truly hope this one sticks around!  

My friends and I stopped by for happy hour, even though this place is still under it's \"soft opening\".

We had beer and wine, and then ordered some bruschetta, a meat and cheese plate, hummus and an ahi tuna panini.
All of the food was very tasty, and the drinks were equally delicious."}
{"text":"Updating my review. The place is under new ownership and has really lost some credibility in my eyes. I really want to love it. Ahwatukee needs something like this so badly! 

The wine selection is smaller than I hoped for at a \"wine bar\" and the food could use some attention. The hummus was so salty is was nearly inedible. The bruschetta was decent but nothing special... Almost tasted like sliced bread from a bag. Not toasted. 

The flatbread was so soggy I could only eat two small slices and when I was asked why I didn't eat my dinner and explained to them I just didn't like it.. They took 10% off. Oh? So I didn't eat hardly any of the pizza but instead of removing it or offering me something else you only take 10% off? Lame. 

They have some things to learn in food quality and customer service. Not planning on returning."}
{"text":"Ok, I hate to call shenanigans on my fellow Yelpians but shame on you for giving the reviews for Unwined that you did.   Or at least most of you.  Are you all friends of the owners?  We just tried it.... Based upon the reviews.    Our server basically knew that there was white or red wine, both kinds.  ...that's about it.        We ordered hummus and they brought us something more like what I expect out of a baby food jar.   Not like any hummus that I have ever had.  We called it at that point.... No reason to continue that experience.  Headed over to the Pear for a good meal and experience.   The Tuke needed a good wine bar.... And it still does.  Don't waste your time here.   A new place will be here soon.  Take care"}
{"text":"We live nearby and we were excited about this place our first time.  Great concept!  We sat towards the rear the first time.  It was quiet enough to relax and have conversation.  We thought we'd found our special place.  But each of the next few times we went it was annoyingly loud to have our own conversation.  The trouble is perhaps the metal tile ceilings and lack of sound absorbing surfaces.  Sound reverberates and it's worse when they have a band.  If they'd fix the acoustics, I think we'd really enjoy this place.  Pleasant wait staff and good menu and wine."}
{"text":"Loved the food. Boards and bruschetta are excellent and they had a great selection of both mainstream and one off wine selections. Service was on point. Rombauer by the glass!! Way to go! Will be back."}
{"text":"I'll preface by saying they are under new management for, currently, less than a month, and the bar area has a very nice atmosphere for hanging out or watching a game. Their beer selection, and whiskeys (to an extent), are also respectable. That said...

Seemed like workers didn't really feel like being there, were strangely reluctant to be attentive. Went during happy hour, at the bar, with just one or two other couples there, but despite 2-3 people behind the bar, it was still very difficult for my wife and I to get their attention. On one occasion she had to say \"excuse me\" three times even though the bartender was right in front facing away from us. Got our orders wrong on two occasions (they were nice enough to change our order after we had placed a different order-but this was also due to them not giving both the full + happy hour menus from the start). Bartender also didn't know what Campari was when trying to describe a drink, \"that doesn't sound familiar.\" I hope they survive, there aren't many other places to escape & relax in the area, this was just kind of a disappointment & depressing experience for a $50 happy hour."}
{"text":"I bought the 4-person Groupon because a friend lives in the area and I wanted to meet her on her turf. I was a little skeptical given the lukewarm reviews but this is such a great restaurant tucked away in a typical Phoenix strip mall. We went on Saturday and there was live music and the big tables near the bar area, which were recommended by our server, were perfect for our wine and beer flights. So many reviews said the service was terrible but the owner (or manager) was very kind and attentive, as was our wonderful server, Alexandra. I really enjoyed the varied wine list; if you're going with the Groupon, definitely get the wine flight because you get a good amount of wine for your buck. The food was really good: along with the wine/beer flights and charcuterie that came with the Groupon, our table ordered the Cuban, bruschetta sampler, carrot cake, and a burger, which were all really good. (Personal note: the Cuban was one of the best I've ever had.) I can't say enough good things and only wished I lived closer to the 'Tukee to enjoy this spot more often."}
{"text":"I really, really, really wanted to like this place and hope they can work the kinks out and stay in business. However, it's a long shot if they keep their current manager. 

I've been here twice, once with my hubby on date night; looking for a romantic place to enjoy a glass of wine and some much needed convo. Manager sauntered over, had a seat in our cosy corner and proceeded to complain to us about his employees and how much more work that put on him! Well, you're the manger yo!

Next visit, I brought my family. We did not know ahead of time, but they were having a free wine tasting hosted by this same manager.  He wrongly assumed that we were wine newbies and arrogantly shared his vision to bring wine education to our community through his hand selected wine list... Which of course, wasn't the same wine list he would choose for himself. When not serving wine behind his wine barrel tasting station, he sat playing on his phone. Yikes!

I wish I could say the food made up for the poor experience, however the bruschetta (low cost, high profit item) we all shared, was flavorless. Hummus was the highlight. 

Overall look and feel of the place is clubby and warm. Unfortunately, cheap table chairs, while nice looking, are uncomfortable. 

Even though this place is needed and welcome in my neighborhood... They need to bump it up!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and good happy hour prices. Love the setting. Family style bar and a bleached brick wall along with the \"vintage\" Tim roof make this a pretty cool place to hang out for the evening. Live music on the weekends. Very popular at night. I hope this place makes it. With the Perfect Pear across the street, this part of town is getting some class."}
{"text":"My husband and I sauntered in on a Thursday night and, while the atmosphere is lovely and the service excellent, we ordered two smoked salmon dinner salads and they arrived with nothing less than canned salmon.  This was a dinner salad, not a side salad.  And the salmon was not smoked....it was canned.  Needless to say, I was less than pleased and couldn't finish mine."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience. Came in for an anniversary dinner and we were very pleased. Had a Groupon, like many others, but didn't really think much about pictures or what we got served. Granted the \"beer flight\" was small, but, the wife's wine flight was three generous pours. Amy, our server, was pleasant, upbeat, cheerful and could carry on an adult conversation with numerous tables. The live piano player added an extra \"air\" to the whole experience. Overall, a very wonderful evening spent celebrating our anniversary and so SUPER glad we had the Groupon or we would have never found this place!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience tonight at Unwined! Service was great and the green chile hummus was amazing (wish the portion size was bigger).  The Arizona bruschetta was a table favorite! Loved the sangria and Cuban sandwich."}
{"text":"Amazing On Tuesdays, great wine tasting. Staff is friendly and knowledgable. Everything that I had (bruschetta and crab cakes) were above average."}
{"text":"I've been to Unwined twice; once with my husband and once with a girlfriend. My husband and I had a Groupon, so we started with the cheese plate and 2 wine flights. Our server helped us with wine selections for our wine flights and brought us our cheese plate. The plate was your average cheese plate. Nothing to write home about, but it had some tasty snacks on it. We also tried the pepperoni flatbread, which was delicious, and the poutine. The poutine has queso fresco instead of cheese curds (which is an OK sub), and not enough gravy. The gravy could also taste a bit richer. 

The second time we tried 2 of the bruschetta and the poutine - this time we ordered it with extra gravy. Better!!! For wine, My friend and I both tried \"The Pundit\" and really enjoyed it. We ordered a dessert that, as it turned out, was no longer available, so one of the owners came out to personally apologize and bring us a substitute dessert, free of charge. Nice!

On both visits, we were warmly greeted and received attentive service from our servers. I love the bar area, which is actually more like 2 bars and offers plenty of space. In addition to an impressive wine list, they have 13 or so beers on tap, and 10 of them are microbrews. Fantastic!!! I've already purchased another Groupon, so we'll be back soon! Looking forward to trying the smoked salmon cakes!"}
{"text":"I do not understand all the rave reviews. The bruschetta had a huge glob of fig jam which threw the flavor out of balance. I would have preferred a spread over a huge amount of jam.  Craft beers are delicious, however I feel as though I can get them at a better price at somewhere like postinos. I feel as though they are copying postinos, but don't have it figured out like them. The service was really good I'll give them that. The kellerweis on draft was delicious."}
{"text":"Love this place since the new management.  Everyone is very knowledgeable, they know their wines, and what good service is.  The food is delicious.  Very good bruschetta, scallops, and burgers.  Tried the NOLA shrimp last time and loved it.  LIve music on Saturdays.  Great place to relax."}
{"text":"Nice local place for a happy hour or light dinner. Good variety of live music on Fridays and Sat. Decent wine selection and wide range of micro brews on tap."}
{"text":"Went here for the very first time, as I had got a Groupon. The place is beautiful & the staff excellent. JEFF at the entrance was so courteous & Friendly & our server HOPE was Wonderful. Very attentive & tried to do everything possible to make it a pleasant evening. The music was great & the guy had an amazing voice. We stayed on to listen to the music.
As many others have reviewed here, the picture on Groupon & what you get is totally different. You get 3 small 3 Oz glasses of beer or wine. Not 6 filled to the top as in the picture on Groupon. The meat & Cheese board is just the minimum. 2 small wedges of 2 types of cheese, a small slice of goat cheese, a few very thin slices of meat, 2 slices of toasted bread, which was very oily, 2 Strawberries cut in 4 & 2 thin slices of Apple. Not worth the price paid.
We stayed on for dinner as well. Most things on the menu were not available. The server felt bad as all we ordered was not available or discontinued. It would have been good if they had a note on there to say it was not available or if the server informed us before we made up our minds on what we wanted to eat. Their menu online is hardly visible & not updated. Prices are changed. Food was nothing much at all & very, very small portions. My husband ordered the shrimp  which was Super tiny & I knew it was not enough for him. So I gave him half of my meal. Which was not much either. I ordered the French pig which was a Pork Chop & came with half cooked green beans & mash. My Mum ordered the Chicken & it was the same sides. My husband is normally not a big eater & almost every restaurant we go to we always have leftovers. Here it was not even enough as our meal. He came out of the restaurant & headed straight to Safeway next door & bought 2 Muffins & had that in the car. I thought I was ok, but was awake since 3 a.m. as I was so hungry. So we paid $20 or more per person & was left hungry. I ordered another drink as the Beer Flight was hardly anything. But the server forgot to get it. I was halfway through my meal when my husband asked her about it. So I had to let it go. I didn't need it by then.
I would love to go back here for the ambiance, music & Friendly staff. But certainly not for the food. They really need to do something about the taste & portions. It's sad to see such a nice place wasted."}
{"text":"Had an amazing dinner here excellent  food great live music and stunning service I will be back for sure I heard that it has been under new ownership for a while and I can tell you they are doing it right this time around the owners have a great deal of passion for there busines"}
{"text":"Enjoy the live music, variety of beer and wine. I tried it the week it originally opened and was very pleased. Kudos to  the new owners, they've added more to the experience."}
{"text":"My daughter and I just tried this place on a groupon.  I do not drink wine but thought it would be a fun thing to do with her.  I was so pleasantly surprised how nice and delicious the fruit and meat board was.  The waiter was so nice and helpful and picked out the wines he thought I would like because my taste is on the sweeter side.  He was right on.  The presentation of the wine was a nice surprise.  We also ordered two bruschetta's that were delicious.  The owner came over a few times to see that we were enjoying everything.  I am told Unwined is under new management and I would say they are doing a great job!  Their food menu looked delicious and I can't wait to come back to try some of their specials.  I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Came on a Monday so it was quiet and you can't beat all day happy hour. Salmon cakes were amazing and service was attentive and helpful. If it wasn't so far away I would come here all the time!"}
{"text":"Mark and I have wanted to live close to a wine bar for some time, and now we do. Super close...so we really want this place to be successful! The ambiance was relaxing and cool, our waitress was very friendly and helpful and the bottle of zin we ordered was reasonably priced and jammy. Although we only ordered olives, it appears people feel the chef needs to fine tune the food options a bit. Of course we wouldn't mind one or two vegan options added as well. Unwined is very close to excellence. We will continue to support them as they hone their craft!"}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to dine at Unwined on a recent Saturday evening with another couple.  We were in search of a restaurant in the Ahwautukee area and decided on Unwined based on Yelp reviews and the picture of the S'mores Dessert pictured on their website!

Upon arrival we were greeted by Cory who was also our server.  The decor is inviting and somewhat homey.  The tin ceiling tiles is a nice touch.  Although one of my fellow diners thought the tiles were plastic made to look like tin.  If so, they did the trick!  There were a few people at the bar and a few other tables occupied.  This didn't change during the evening.  Unwined also has live music however not on the night of my visit.  I wonder what the noise level would be like with music and the 'tin' ceiling tiles.  I'll need to make a return visit to check it out.

We skipped appetizers and ordered our entrees ... salmon salad, cheese & meat board with a salad, French pig (prok chop) and scallops.  Since the S'mores Dessert was one of the reasons we selected Unwined, we indulged and were quite glad we did.  We also enjoyed a 2012 Silver Palm Zinfandel.  With tip the total bill was $180.00 or $45 per person.  While a bit pricey, all diners enjoyed their meals.

A few notes, for some reason the scallops didn't come with a salad; the diner ordered one when he determined 5 scallops weren't going to be satisfying.  The diner who ordered the French pig asked for a Caesar salad instead of a dinner salad.  Cory wasn't sure if the substitution could be made.  It wasn't and he didn't comment about it.  Perhaps he forgot when he got back to the kitchen.  Finally, the S'mores Dessert is highly recommended!  The dessert is served in a skillet with a bed of graham crackers, melted chocolate chips and topped with marshmallows!  The skillet sits on a board with additional graham crackers.  Cory offered to bring additional graham crackers if needed.  

A nice neighborhood restaurant!

{"text":"Was there last night. We got there late and was so thankful they welcomed us with open arms. The place is beautiful inside. The food was absolutely delicious and our waiter Tracy  was excellent . Will be back for more good food and to hear some smooth Jazz.  Only thing negative was the girl behind the bar heard her complaining. plus one person with us with had to send back a drink she made but Tracy fixed it because he made it himself he is also knowledgeable on the entire menu. First time and will go back . Thanks to Tracy so up beat service with a smile. I did not check if they have ground pepper or sea salt to me that taste so much better I use it at home to cook"}
{"text":"Some friends recommended this place. We are big supporters of the local restaurants as background information. Last nights experience was terrible when we went as group of six couples.. The people who ordered fish and chips were happy. The majority who had appetizers and salads were less than pleased. I've never experienced bruschetta that was untoasted  and soggy. It was horribly bad on multiple orders. The toasted Caesar salad was equally bad. To top things off we waited for 40 minutes to get our bill which took numerous iterations to finally get correct that was split by couple... This is my third time here, but will not go back."}
{"text":"The boy and I came here to check the place out, mostly because of a Groupon deal for 2 flights of beer or wine and a cheese plate and I don't think we will be back.

First impressions were good, cute place loved the décor, the wall paper, and the decorate tin ceilings.  We got there at 5 PM on a Friday and it was pretty empty but the place was packed by 6 PM.  I appreciated the extended happy hour time (3-7 PM) but the value wasn't there.  A few dollars off Apps and $2 off wine doesn't necessarily make me \"happy\".  I was impressed with the beer selection but not by the patrons, holy Real Housewives of the Ahwatukee Foothills!

Overall, there were some hiccups with our visit.  I understand that Groupon uses stock photos  but what I paid for and what we got was very lackluster.  The photo showed 2 sets of 6 tasting glasses, turns out you get 3, 3 oz pours of either beer or wine.  You can pick your tastings, which was a nice touch, but 3 vs 6 is a big difference.  The Meat and Cheese plate was skimpy as well.  The plate consisted of 3 meats and 3 cheeses with the cheese portion being fair, but the meat selection was 3 thin slices per meat.  The cheese selection was nice, but all 3 were flavored cheeses and you didn't get to pick.  There were 2 strawberries cut in 4ths, a handful of grapes, and 2 pieces of toast to round out the board.  Groupon said this deal (2 flights, meat/cheese board) was worth $48 but it was barely worth $20.

There were other missteps with the food, not sure if it was the kitchen or our server's fault.  There was no printed beer list, just a chalkboard up on the wall.  Novel idea but the boy had to get up to see the offerings, then had to get up again to look when the server came to take his order because he had forgotten already.  I ordered a few HH items and the wedge salad and the boy went for the surf and turf.  All of our food came out at once, the apps with the entrée which was a rookie move.  Like I said, not sure if this was the server or the kitchen's choosing.  I also had issue with my wine pour.  After the flight I got 2 regular glasses of wine.  One was brought to me in a carafe, ok I get it a measured pour but a few min later I saw another server taking a wine glass to another table that was poured at the bar and was at least 1-2 oz more than what I got.  What gives? 

The food itself was just ok.  Like a previous review, the salmon for the Bruschetta was dry and lacked flavor.  The boy liked his surf and turf but I thought it lacked seasoning, the potatoes were bland and the scallops needed something more to make them pop.  The filet was a nice cut, it was so tender I was able to cut it with my butter knife.

Over all, the concept was nice but the execution was missing in several areas.  When I think about our experience all I can say is, \"It's Ahwatukee\"."}
{"text":"I had the most wonderful evening at Unwined. Met the owner and her handsome sons...who are gracious and charming. The wine selection was super ... I had a wine flight and a cheese and meat tray. How tasty. I followed this with the Warm Kale salad..... delicious.  I plan to be back for more local flavor and gracious hosting. How wonderful to have such a super Wine Bar in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I've been to Unwined several times now, so I feel like I have a pretty good sense of what it's about.  If I could give it 2.5 stars, I would. It's between \"meh\" and \"ok.\"

On my first visit, shortly after this place opened, I just came in to take a look and check out the bar. And I'll admit it, I have pretty high standards when it comes to drinks, but the woman who was bartending that night was awful. She acted like I was inconveniencing her when I ordered a Manhattan and couldn't tell me a thing about the \"tincutures\" used in the house cocktails (more on that later). So I ordered something simpler. However, because I haven't seen her working at the bar since that visit, I won't waste any more time on her.

The second time I visited, it was about 8:30 pm on a Tuesday night, and my friend and I were hungry. So we decided to give Unwined's food a try. The place was empty except for a couple drinking beer at the end of the bar, but I could see two employees by the register behind the bar, so we approached to ask if the kitchen was still open. No joke, it took almost five minutes before anyone acknowledged us. I know that the manager (I found out later who he was) saw us, but he said nothing until he was done at the register. Then he turned around and said, \"Ok, what can we get you? Sorry for the wait, but I had to deal with *that*\" (indicating the other employee). I found this man's aggrieved attitude pretty unprofessional, but the kitchen was open, and we were starved. So. 

Our meal was a surprisingly good experience--my friend's Big Tukee burger was perfectly prepared and delicious. I gambled and ordered the Smoked Salmon cakes (I am really, really particular about my seafood).  They were also very good.  On this visit, I also decided to take a look at the wine menu; after all, Unwined refers to itself as \"Ahwatukee's premier wine bar.\"  I was underwhelmed. But given the lack of good restaurants in the foothills area, it was a relief to know the food was good, even if the menu is very limited. So I knew I'd be back another time to try their other offerings.

So flash forward to mid-December (four weeks ago). I accompanied some friends to Unwined for dinner. They'd never been before, so I recommended the burger and the salmon cakes, for sure. I decided to try the warm kale salad.  Except for the salmon cakes, the meal was a bust. The burgers were way overcooked and dry (which made me embarrassed and disappointed for recommending them), and the kale salad made us laugh. It wasn't \"warm\" in the least, but the funny part was how enormous the pieces of kale were. I mean huge. As happens sadly often in restaurants, the salad appeared to be made by someone who doesn't even eat kale. My friends and I agreed that the vinaigrette was tasty, but I had to cut up all of the leaves up so I'd have a chance of getting one in my mouth. Honestly, I felt silly. We had fun catching up with one another, but none of our party is ready to go running back to Unwined to eat.

Remember my comment about the bad bartender and the tinctures? Now I get to the part about Unwined that really, really bugs me. First of all, they have no business trying to sell craft cocktails, because as far as I can tell, this place does not employ a qualified bartender. I am crazy about top-notch cocktails (Hello, Citizen Public House!), but I'm equally happy with a simple glass of Woodford. Unwined needs to either stick to the basics or invest in a real bartender--not the manager making weird Old Fashioneds, and whatever you do, don't order the Sazerac. It is downright terrible.  

Now, I'm not exactly an oenophile, but I do know quite a bit about wine, the characteristics of varietals, etc. Let me just put it this way: the wine list here is unimaginative. For example, the whites by the glass--there are 14 of them BUT it's so pedestrian and formulaic. 3 cheap sparklers, 3 chardonnays, 3 sauvignon blancs, 2 pinot grigios. You get the picture. As another reviewer pointed out, the manager likes to put on a big show about \"educating\" his patrons about wine. Maybe he thinks we're kindergartners? *sigh* Even the reds were nothing to write home about. I can appreciate owners not wanting to lose money on uncorking an expensive bottle for what may only be one or two pours, but the selections here are either $5, $7 or $8, with one red at $9/glass. I love a great, inexpensive find as much as the next person, but every wine I've tried so far has been just ok, which is what I would expect, given these prices.  There's nothing wrong with \"ok,\" but this place is pretending to be something it's not. The owners need to go hang out and take notes at places like Postino, Cheuvront, Kazimierz, 5th and Wine, Vintage 95, Terroir Wine Pub (especially the latter, since it's very close in spirit to Unwined), and so on. Until then, I fear that Unwined's reach will continue to exceed its grasp."}
{"text":"Made it here last Friday and wanted to make sure people know what a freak place it is!  Live music was great but we only caught the last hour.  This guy will be back on the 7/23, Planning on going back for the music and the MOm's meatloaf!"}
