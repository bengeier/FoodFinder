{"text":"I've never really had \"bad\" Chinese food until I tried this place. Delivery was fast, but the food needs improvement. Egg drop soup had so much long stringy cabbage in it, had no flavor, and the won tons were stale or under cooked. The chicken dish I had was so dry it must have been cooked that morning and sat in a pot all day. And then rice was sticky/hard."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! 5 star huge portions ! Anyone looking to eat some great Chinese food I highly recommend  d&y"}
{"text":"The orange chicken was terrible.  The coating on the chicken was extremely thick as if to hide the small amount of chicken that was coated.  Very little sauce.  Very bland.

The crab puffs seemed to be lacking in the crab department.  Of the 4 that I tore apart I did not find a single piece of crab nor could I taste any.

Extremely disappointed.  Will not return."}
{"text":"Great vegetarian options.  Fast, friendly service!"}
{"text":"Second time here and so far the food has been consistently good. Lunch combo was over two pounds of food and not mostly veggies like some local Chinese places do. Food was hot and fresh and I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Neighbors please rush out and try this place.  The food is authentic and delicious.  The decor is dated and drab, but the people are great and the food is excellent.  Ask to see the special \"Chinese menu\" with specialty offerings, but even the regular American/Chinese menu has anything and everything you could ask for.  Food is great.  Let's support this place in our backyard so it stays open.  We are getting take-out once a week.  Thank you D&Y!!"}
{"text":"First time here. Great food & service. Nice to finally find a good Chinese restaurant. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"The food is good. Served hot. Good service fair price. Authentic Chinese restraunt. Down to the table in the corner covered with papers not sure about  the cardboard on the floor next to the soda fountain instead of a rug. But the front of the restraunt is decent. Plan on doing take out some time."}
{"text":"Please stay away from here. The shrimp are very fishy tasting. The entire place stinks and they have some home made tank system for fish ,lobster and other seafood. Not sure it meets requirements..

So do yourself a favor and pass on this place."}
{"text":"The chicken and noodles is my favorite. I also get the spring rolls everytime. It's delicious. The portions are huge and we always do take out and the food is always hot when we get home!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend!  The decor isn't much to look at but the food is delicious, the portions are large and the prices are decent."}
{"text":"This place is not expensive for the quality of food that it offers. The staff are friendly. Our food came out fast. The place is clean. There is not any negative to say about D & Y as it is all that an authentic Chinese restaurant would offer. I will come back again even though I live in Mesa."}
{"text":"If you order roasted pork to go , open and check before bring home, i order roasted pork to go when I bought home all fat not a roasted pork"}
{"text":"The general tso and tofu are large portions. Pretty impressive and better than our first visit here. No beer. White rice standard. Hot is about medium spicy
Large standard menu."}
{"text":"This place is freakin amazing for local \"regular \" Chinese. Food portions are large, high quality meats, they don't skimp, good prices, absolutely delicious!!!"}
{"text":"So my dad and I ordered delivery yesterday from this place. The wait was a bit long but the food was pretty good. They are reasonably price and the food portions are plenty. I really enjoyed the shrimp lo main the most but everything we had was seasoned perfectly. Come to think of it I didn't even use one drop of soy sauce which is very good. The delivery guy was nice and I just had a good experience with is place all the way around. I do recommend the beef and broccoli and the king pao two. Both were very good. I failed to get pictures this time but next time I will for sure."}
{"text":"Finally some real Chinese food!!! So glad I gave it this place a try. Service was fast and friendly. Double thumbs up."}
{"text":"New place in town. Got a menu on our door. Checked it out tonight and we were not disappointed. Great soup, great portions, Lo Mein and MaiFun were outstanding. Got free crab puffs with coupon and ordering over $20.00 - ALL so good. This will be our go-to chinese!  There are tables inside. We got to go order and it was ready in 15 minutes. 

LOVED IT!"}
{"text":"New place that looks good when you walk in.  Waitress was extremely nice.  Just wish food was better.  Crab Puffs were greasy; could see oil sitting on puffs.  Generous portions, really too big, but taste was lacking.  Was not hot, soup was bland.  Shrimp was lacking flavor.  Coating on chicken was too thick. Bbq pork was dry ; sauce was OK. MOST LIKELY WILL NOT RETURN EVEN THOUGH IT IS LOCATED CLOSE TO ME."}
{"text":"D & Y Chinese is not your average Chinese Take-out Restaurant but they also offer that too. How many places can you name in Glendale that offer JellyFish head with Sweet Peas..? D & Y Chinese offers a Canton Mandarin Menu and also offer a tank of live fish. Sunday isn't the best day to visit because they only had one fish left. This isn't a fancy place. It's a little unorganized and they use different parts of the dining room as a storage room.

The help are friendly and seem sincere. We made our order and waited 45 minutes for our meals to be prepared.

I tried the just killed Tilapia. It was prepared to perfection just like fish you get at a fine restaurant. I guess fish just taste so much better when it's that fresh. It just melted in my mouth. They served the fish in a soy ginger broth that was slightly oily and topped the fish with a shredded vegetable that might have been celery. 

My husband ordered the Beef with Black pepper. I tasted one piece. It was a bit dry and chewy.

Fish was the sweet spot here.

For that reason I would give a 3.5 star rating if I could.

The fish was so good that I bumped the rating to 4 stars."}
{"text":"Picked up a some combo dinners to go at this close by new restaurant. The amount of food was great for a combination dinner. Enjoyed the orange chicken, beef and broccoli and sweet and sour chicken. All were good. My order included free fried rice. The crab puffs were outstanding! Will visit again, maybe in there dining area which looks very well maintaine"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch after being highly recommended by one of my best friends. This place offers authentic Chinese dishes, big portions and reasonable prices also. Another great addition on the West side that will be one of my go to for Chinese. Cannot wait to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Good new restaurant with authentic Chinese food. Have several set family meals that are reasonably priced and has a variety of dishes. Ask for the roast duck with sweet sauce. It's a delicious twist on roast duck."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from here for the first time. The wait wasn't too long considering it being a busy Saturday night. I ordered the Sesame Chicken and it was some of the best I've had, not overly breaded like most places. I'll definitely be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I ordered sweet and sour chicken through the Doordash app and the chicken arrived without sauce... so that was pretty disappointing. The rest was fine."}
{"text":"We had my brother wedding rehearsal dinner here for over 30 of us.  My parents made reservations and pre-ordered our food.  I'm surprised that even they pre-ordered our dinner over 2 weeks ago the food was mediocre.  The roast pork was all fat.  The beef chow fun was good.  The special soup was okay. The rest of the dishes were good but I had better."}
{"text":"Great place! All the years I've lived near GCC we could never find a decent Chinese takeout spot until D & Y put that golden takeout menu on our door. They have large portions! The dumplings were great, in fact everything was. We are trying the Cantonese noodles and pepper beef tonight and we are excited!"}
{"text":"Great quality, large portions. Easy to order online and our order is always ready when we pick it up. The ladies who run the register and front of the restaurant are incredibly helpful and friendly. I'm addicted to their Cantonese noodles!"}
{"text":"This is one of the Chinese restaurants in our rotation.

You can tell how good an ethnic restaurant is by the number of people of that ethnicity eating there. Every time we have gone there have been large groups of Asian customers.

We like to order the combination dinners, chicken, beef, pork or shrimp, which come with Fried Shrimp, Egg Roll, Fried Rice and soup for $8.75.

The ambiance isn't P. F. Chang's, but the food and prices are better."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Chinese restaurants. I've been here a couple times and the food is always delicious. Their service is very quick, I usually order take out and it's ready within 10 minutes. Their staff are also very nice. The prices are good for the amount of food you get, compared to other places like Panda Express. I always get orange chicken or Kung pao chicken and it's very good."}
{"text":"Haven't even tried the food not happy with ordering online 30 min ago and paying online to arrive at store and be told it will take another 30 min... 
Maybe I'll update once I eat at minimum figure out away to give an ETA on the order."}
{"text":"The food and  is great! Good portions of food. Plan on ordering take out though. They need new carpet or new ceiling tiles. Something inside has a bad odor that makes the whole place smell bad. It is clean, and it stinks inside. Windows need to be kept clean. Otherwise I would give 5 stars."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and it was very delicious. Very authentic to basic foods. It is right down the street from my parent's house so it's very convenient. The service was great too. 

We loved the food so much that we order different dishes for our Christmas dinner and everyone loved it. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Possibly the best Chinese Restaurant in Glendale. Meals are delicious and served fresh. Minimum waiting time and very clean and open dining room and lots of parking. Check it out and bring your appetite!"}
{"text":"Last dinner before our flight home, wife found this place on the local flyer.  We ordered oyster, clam, crab and a couple veggie dishes. All came out nicely looking and taste wise.

In chatting with the owner/chef, we learned that this restaurant opened just a few months. The inside appears \"old\" and doesn't have the new renovation appearance.  It is not a big concern."}
{"text":"Had the General Tso combo.  Nothing special, but a lot of food and tasted fine."}
