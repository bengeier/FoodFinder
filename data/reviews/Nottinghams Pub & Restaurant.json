{"text":"The feel and look of a British Pub in an fairly established community.  Has a couple of pool tables and a great atmosphere. Great place to just hang."}
{"text":"I will never ever go back here. It's unfortunate, because the food it fantastic and its close to home. The lady that works in the evenings (sheena) has horrible customer service skills. A self professed \"regular\" told me she has complained to the owner about her yet she still works here. If you don't like serving people get a new job. When someone says thank you, you should say your welcome. When someone is standing at the bar, you should stop your personal conversations with your co-worker and serve the customer. If your delivering food and someone is waiting you should acknowledge them and say you'll be right with them. Just a few tips. I normally tip exceptionally well, as I work in the industry but in case your wondering why you got no tip on our 150+ bill that is why."}
{"text":"Long, long, time customer. New location, obvious issues.,owners r always nice, despite request for well done wings.....not. Forget wifi- only place including nyc, la, etc no wifi, owners paranoid!!!"}
{"text":"Stand by for  my review I am enjoying my food and experience too much.  Well after driving by Nottinghams for the past year I had to finally stop and check the place out.  Boy are we glad we did.  If you want authentic, great tasting English/ pub food you need to stop by too.  I had the curry lamb shepards style pie while my sweetheart had the Shepards pie.  Mmmm. Earlier we could not decide and with each dish being brought out to other tables we said\" we need to come back and try that\".  Add to the fact a good selection of beers and dynamite service it was a enjoyable and lovely evening and experts.  Looking forward to our next visit. Now will that be the fish and chips or that eye widening burger!!"}
{"text":"I have been here many times, always great food, service is ok, always friendly, gets noisy though. try the burgers, they are great."}
{"text":"Courteous staff however this pub only caters to the VLT zombies and not the neighbourhood clientele that it claims. Big disappointment for the neighbours!"}
{"text":"Here's the thing...ya 5 stars is a lot for a pub BUT I'm not comparing it with a great fancy restaurant, just other pubs.  I challenge anyone to find a pub with better quality food that leaves you wanting more! And the service is incredible. It really doesn't matter who is working but these ladies are the most efficient servers/bartenders around - and super friendly at the same time! The wings are delicious, and the beef dip destroys any other I've tasted in other pubs and restaurants."}
{"text":"Friday afternoon- why not grab a few drinks with your coworkers after work?  I'll tell you why not- because the pub you've chosen has one person working front of house.  The same girl was responsible for taking orders, making drinks, serving food and drinks and processing payments for the ten or twelve tables of guests who were inside.  We waited forever (good thing they had free popcorn to munch on).  The menu looked okay (nice to see a couple vegetarian choices) and my drink was fine... but the staffing situation is unacceptable.  It's not her fault; management needs to make sure the pub is appropriately staffed."}
{"text":"Yesterday I had to support a friend in her pursuit of taking her relationship on a new level and came out with her to watch her boyfriend play soccer. (Yay, JOY JOY).   What kind of soccer game is it if there is no beer after?   I liked the place instantly. Cozy, well furnished and decorated.   I liked the nachos - tasty, fresh. Great menu in all.   But here is what really deserves a special word:  As most of you know, I am a sucker for great service. You can sell me snow in winter if you smile and offer it to me on a sliver plate.   Sometimes mid-party I was my usual self and while telling one of my many stories (the teammates of my friend's boyfriend were kind of cute, so that called for sharing. NOTE: no mentioning of my ex!)   So, under the influence of alcohol and attention, my artistic talents really escaped boundaries and to support the story I was telling, I had to pretend as I was choking. After hearing loud outbursts of laughter (they did like the story), I felt a light tap on my shoulder - the waitress, a very cute young woman was standing beside me, with a very concerned look.  \"Would you like a glass of water? Are you OK?\"   OMG, what a sweetheart! Actually, she was amazing in every way you would expect your party waitress to be. So, A +++ for service and customer care.   One thing I found disappointing - the two pool tables are very close to each other on ends. So, if you are trying to retrieve the balls to rack them, the other table has to stop the game as there is no room for two people. Or vice verso - until they sink all the balls at this end, you have to wait to rack. I am an avid pool player, so details like that are very important to me.   Great place! If you nearby there one day - I would strongly recommend."}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood pub. The waitress was fantastic - friendly and helpful! The burger was delicious. Onion rings were too greasy for me but the portion was large. I appreciated their gear draft beer list, definitely some good craft beer."}
{"text":"had the all day breakfast, 2 eggs, spolumbo sausage, 2 slices of bacon, hash browns and toast.  skipped the toast for extra hash browns.  everything was cooked well, nicely basted eggs, crisp bacon, but i thought the serving was a bit on the skimpy side.  service was good but i will get something else off the menu."}
{"text":"Surprisingly awesome!  I was expecting dingy local pub, but it's updated, the food is good (try the loaded pouring!), and the service friendly.  TVs a plenty, and you don't need to break the bank to eat here."}
{"text":"On our GPS system, we were headed for what we thought was an Asian Shang-hai restaurant in this strip plaza in Scenic Acres. I was starving for some rice/noodles/spring rolls. In we go to the parking lot and there is no Asian restaurant anymore but there is the newly moved Nottingham's! I had not been to the older location either so this place was a first for me. We went in and it wasn't busy but it got busier throughout the time we were there - around 5pm. And it was Happy Hour! (until 8pm) The waitress was working solo manning everything as I had read on prior reviews. She was very nice though and patient, explaining her faves on the menu. She said there was something about their BLT - one couple drives from Cochrane quite often for their BLT. One guy comes in every morning for his BLT so it has to be good right!? And for $6!??? No sides though, just the sandwich and I went for it. It was very good. The sandwich was large and well balanced. Hubby had a burger, as always and he quite liked it with his side of yam fries. He had a pint too and they have a deal on, displayed on posters on the wall that for $15 you get a pint and the burger with a side. YUMMY! We waited some time for our food and during that time all I could think about was my Asian faves - but after the food came out I was sold. The pub itself has some nice features, a water feature, a fireplace, a lit up bar but I did not feel like I was in any kind of British pub. But - that was ok!  3 stars for good service and very decent food. I loved the menu pricing - it was great. Supposedly the VLTs (video casino games) keep this place going, generates a lot of income and people were playing on those 10 machines.(not me!) This is a place where the regulars gather - and I can see why!  Oh! And free popcorn - help yourself when you walk in and take it to your table!"}
{"text":"Went here once for fish and chips special, was ok, def had that neighbourhood pub feel,  but it needed More beer selection for me"}
{"text":"A - List. Recommended. This is the best kept secret in Silver Springs. The food is excellent and reasonably priced. The drinks are cold and reasonably priced. The service is excellent - friendly, efficient. As you would expect in a pub, you will find a couple of pool tables, a few screens and VLTs. There is also a nice fireplace and somewhat smaller couch in the corner to chill. Then check out the bathroom, you will make your way through a faux stone arch, like that of Nottigham. And the bathroom is castle funky-like but not overstated. People come here because it is comfortable, friendly with great food and drinks at reasonable prices. There is free popcorn as well. check it out."}
{"text":"I frequent this pub quite often as I live across the street. It's perfect for a casual bite when I don't want to venture too far from home, and the quality is extremely consistent. I LOVE the wings and the free popcorn. I've also tried the Steak Sandwich, Fish and Chips, and Meat Pies. Everything is tasty and comes out extremely quickly. The waitresses are friendly, and the prices are reasonable. The last time I was here, I figured out why I always found the ambiance to be \"off\". The lights are too bright! Most pubs have somewhat low lighting, and with it being so bright, it feels awkward walking in (like everyone is staring at you, lol). Its also pretty small, but I don't mind because it's usually not too busy, and I've never had to wait for a table. The cozy fireplace and relaxed atmosphere is great, I enjoy coming here and will continue to return for the good food in a casual setting."}
{"text":"Firstly, Nottinghams moved sometime in the summer of 2011. SAME strip mall, except a smaller unit.  SO the \"New\" Nottinghams. Well, now the VLTs are in a nice inviting row on the one wall, instead of the corral they were in before.  The bar is WAY longer, it can seat about 15 or 20 people now. This is appropriate, because 75% of the customers are single, alone men --- at the bar. There is now only one pool table, and the remainder of the space consists of standing tables or sit down tables.  There are 2 or 3, or maybe even 4 HUGE TVs behind the bar, which I found an annoyance --- but if you want to watch \"The Game\" then it would be great.  There is still FREE help yourself theatre popcorn.  I have stopped into the \"new\" Nottingham's about 4 times, not because I wanted to go there, but because I was visiting friends in the area.    All the times I went, I asked \"whats on special\"? The reply was \"NOTHING\" -- except for the one time when I was told it was \"happy hour\".  No, she didn't actually tell me the prices of anything, just said its happy hour. She did offer that \"bottled beer would probably be the best deal\" --- but she didnt know for certain.  Ordering blindly, only knowing how much things cost when you get the bill, it turns out that a bottle of domestic beer during happy hour is $5.  Not the deal of the century for sure.  The menu is limited with no unique or intriguing offerings.  The food quality is above \"fair\", so I would call it \"good\" but thats about it.  Items are $11 - $17, so they're obviously employing that failing  operating model whereby they try to get a MINIMUM of $20 or so out of every customer, every time. Do the math, food and 2 beers is OVER $20, and if you have a \"FEW\" drinks plus food your in the $45 - $60 range easy.  Generally speaking, there is ONE girl to run the WHOLE front of the establishment, meaning service can be slow, or VERY slow, depending on demand. Rarely, there may be one girl behind the bar, and then another running tables -- but even then its still only ONE waitress for the whole place.  As previously stated, about 75% of the customers are single, alone high-end trades or low end white collar men drinking after work.  About 10% of customers appeared to be middle to upper end whit collar men, making million dollar oil decisions while getting semi-wasted. The remaining 15% consisted of younger men drinking because the location is close to home and they are still fascinated with going to a \"bar\". So, that's 100% har har har. Thats right NO women here. MAYBE the very odd RARE female, but she is someone's girlfriend / wife or more likely a VLT hag.  Summary: I wouldn't go out of my way to go to Nottingham's, but it does suffice as a meeting spot if you're in the area. I would suggest that you go with someone who is wealthy and offering to pay the tab as well if you're going to do any real drinking."}
