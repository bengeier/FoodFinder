{"text":"Stopped into this location for the first time today and I am impressed! What an amazing coffee! I drink it black and truly savour the taste of coffee. I am always in search of good roasts and people who know how to make it.  I cannot wait to go back and purchase some beans. The peanut cookie was very tasty as well. I was pleased that there were gluten free options and that the owner took the time to explain the ingredients. Like other reviewers I can say that it is clear the owner values the opinions of his customers."}
{"text":"Fantastic cafe in this area! I can't believe I only discovered it now...
Excellent fair trade coffee and the pastries are also delicious.
I liked the Guatemalan pour over and the fresh almond croissants a lot.
The place is beautiful with painting and very clean too. WiFi is fast. Really nice place.
The prices are fair to my opinion, especially, considering the high quality of the products.
The owner also seems very knowledgeable about the coffee so don't hesitate to ask him questions."}
{"text":"The coffee here is amazing. Reminds me of Europe. The owner is very nice and is a wonderful conversationalist. The pastries are delicious, especially the coffee muffin-almost like a coffee flavoured cinnamon roll in a the shape of a muffin. 

Love coming here and there is free wifi."}

{"text":"Ok so this place is a great addition to the neighbourhood it is small and quaint and the coffee is delicious! 

They have more than just one milk alternative, almond, coconut and soy! So for those who are vegan or have dietary needs, you are all covered! Not just that he also had treats! Also wait for it... vegan cookies! that were so tasty. 

Also the small sitting area is covered in cool local art! And has great light coming in from big windows! A perfect private and quiet spot to have coffee with a friend. 

My friend and I stopped in one afternoon and the owner was so keen to answer all the questions we had and he even was able to tell us where his beans were from and that they were organic! 

The best part! The prices were totally reasonable! 

We will for sure be returning the next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"This place is such a gem! I'm so glad my boyfriend happened upon it on his way back from the doctor one day. I now insist on joining him at his appointments. 

As several people have mentioned already, the owner is a great guy - cordial with his customers and obviously quite passionate about coffee. If you are a coffee snob, you will surely enjoy a chat with him as he prepares your order. 

Besides the great brews, they carry a selection of high quality coffee paraphernalia. We purchased a pour over coffee brewer and some filters which we have been very happy with thus far. I also picked up some beautiful Mexican vanilla beans which might be some of the best  I've found outside of Mexico.

I took my cappuccino to go, but I did notice that the seating area seemed cozy and inviting. I will have to try it next time."}
