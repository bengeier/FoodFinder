{"text":"We have always enjoyed the occasional dinning experience at  O'Neill's Place. However, last night's experience was disappointing at best. My Reuben sandwich was on the cold side of warm and contained a sparse quantity of meat.  

Our other dish, the Captains Platter came with the deep fried fish and shrimp extremely over cooked to the point that only a few bites were able to be eaten. Perhaps it was and off-night for the kitchen staff? 

Our server was very pleasant while Paul the owner seemed to be irritated that he was there."}
{"text":"Amazing food & huge craft beer selection, expertly chosen. We got the melt-in-your-mouth  sliders which were amazing and will be our regular meal here. Also had the very meaty ribs which had a slightly spicy flavor with a side of delicious potato salad which was like polished off very quickly.  also ordered the burger which was damn juicy delicious. Happy Hour deals are the best around and They even have their own Leprechaun . Check him out . We've found our new local."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch Easter Sunday.  Just wanted a quick bite before I went back out riding, sat at the bar and ordered frings and a burger. The bartender didn't bother to ask but decided to split my order and hold the burger.  Fries and rings came out. Typical generic bar crap from a bag. nd of course quickly were cold and still no burger.  35 minutes later still didn't have my burger so I ask for my check and left. High point she didn't charge me for food. Then again didn't get my food so makes sense. There were maybe 15 people in the entire place. No excuse for the delay. Will never be back."}
{"text":"The food here was great.   We had wings that were grilled after being quickly fried, burgers, salmon, prime rib, and soup.   All were better than expected.  The prime rib is first class.  Will stop by again any time we are in the area."}
{"text":"Great burgers, love prime rib night, and their $8 burger and beer deal is awesome! Tons of TVs to watch the game and friendly service."}
{"text":"Food good. Server was nice.  Like the abundance of TVs with different sports on them, baseball,  bball, golf,  even bowling (didn't know they televised that any more). This place is worth coming too,  especially if you like sports bar atmosphere but still laid back vibe.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Every time I come here the place has a different name, but other than that everything stays the same.  Food is good, beer is fine.  Lots of TVs.  I've done happy hour and dinner and service is always solid and restrooms are clean.  Solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"Tried again.  Food! was lukewarm to cold.  Found out a new owner and obviously not as involved with menu as Paul was.  Will not be back again unless I see improvement via reviews."}
{"text":"The food is okay (just okay)  but don't expect to get the Prime Rib special if you get there more than 60 minutes after they start serving."}
{"text":"Thought we'd try O'Neill's Place for a happy hour dinner tonight. In the mood for some good wings and beer. O'Neill's was not a good choice! Although bearable, the Wings were like jerky! Dry rub, dry wings, VERY chewy! VERY disappointed. First, this place cannot seem to keep an owner. It's changed hands a couple of times now, and I understand the \"Hero's\" owner is back. If so, he better kick up his game cuz the wings were terrible. My Dos Equis draft was flat....hmmmm....flat beer, bad wings. Are you really wanting to be in the restaurant business? Hope you heed this critic!"}
{"text":"The best place in Mesa to get a pint! Friendly service, good food, excellent atmosphere. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Loving the new ownership! Good food, good music, good people, and a cold pint! What more do you need? It feels like a local pub where everybody knows your name! I am happy I have found my new place."}
{"text":"The main reason I'm writing a review is to let people know that a lot of Seattle Seahawks fans come here to watch the game.  It's rare to find a bar where one doesn't have to actually convince the manager to at least have one TV on for us lonely \"12th men\" here in Arizona.  LOL

The staff is great, and the owner seems to really care if his customers are happy.  Food was great.

One thing though I wish they would change.  They have a screened in patio and people smoke out there.  There is not enough air circulation with the screens up.  Then when the door is opened, the smell of smoke comes in.  It's not really a lot of smoke.  However, it's enough to bother someone with asthma.

Football season 2013 is almost over and that's a sad thing.  Maybe the owner will play some re-runs during the off season?  That might be an even sadder thing though."}
{"text":"Came back after being away for a few years. Unfortunately, not the same. Menu has many similarities but the prices to portions wasn't justifiable. 11 dollars for a iceberg lettuce salad with seven small pieces of chicken, six dollars for two chicken nuggets/strips and a small fruit cup? Okay, it's a sports bar and as others point out, it's pretty laid back. That isn't a defense though for having some value attached to their offerings."}
{"text":"O'Neil's used to be Indigo Joes...I'm a regular who eats there about 5x a week.  The owners Paul and Beth have upgraded the menu and their food is really good - much better than any sports bar I've eaten at....they buy fresh veggies, fresh hamburger, and have the best French fries.  The dining area has a lot of tv's, and the staff is always great."}
{"text":"$15 12oz Prime Rib Dinner on Saturday night.  Includes a baked potato and vegetable side.  Solid deal, and a good beer selection. Check it out."}
{"text":"Schizophrenic experience - Now is called Echo 5, but I'm sure that won't last (WHY is an \"Irish\" pub called this?). This place has changed names/ ownership every other year. 
Nothing Irish on the new menu (except for some of the ales & ciders). The food was ok, but not great. The wings, the one thing we always liked at O'Neil's, was too salty (is the cook a smoker?). 
The service was the one good thing about the \"new\" place. They were friendly, fast, & helpful.
Music was horrible - too loud and a strange mix of country and a few Van Morrison (the only Irish artist they know?) and a few pop songs. It was too loud to tune out what we didn't like. 
Despite the comfy chairs, plenty of TVs, and friendly service, the place was basically empty. This should not be for this location!
SKIP this place - but check back in another year or so, I'm sure it will change again (probably sooner rather than later from our experience)."}
{"text":"Came to AZ from CT and the buffalo wings here are as good, if not better than those back East.  And that's hard to beat!!!"}
{"text":"Thought we'd give it a try. It was about what I expected; food was ok...not great but not terrible. The selection of beer in tap is good....very cold and offered in three sizes. The service was very good. 
And yes, there are enough TV's to keep most ADD people happy!"}
{"text":"This has been a favorite neighborhood hangout for several years. It was under different owners a couple of years ago, and the service and food both really slipped in their standards. Glad the O'Neills are back, because they have really straightened things out. The burgers are excellent, and the fries are always perfect. They have quite a selection of tap beers for hubby, and and at least one cider for me. Prime Rib on Saturday is the only place that I will order it. Tender as a mother's love, and perfectly seasoned. Veggies are always done just right---not to overcooked. We haven't had an unhappy experience since the ONeills are back. Servers are always on the ball, and the place exudes friendliness."}
