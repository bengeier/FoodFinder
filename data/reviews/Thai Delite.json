{"text":"5 Stars: This place is fantastic!  I love it, think you'll love it, hope all my friends love it, wish I could eat here all the time and hope I'll own a place just like it in my retirement.

5 Stars:  As in, it meets the expectations it sets for itself perfectly well.

This falls into the latter category.

This is a place in my area I go when I'm craving Pad Thai now now NOW.
It's cheap.  They give you lots.  It's pretty fast.
Done.

I've had shrimp pad thai--  found the amount of noodles soak up all the sauce-- I ask for extra.. sauce that is, not noodles- it's obscene, the lid barely shuts.  Hey, value for money.  Their green curry's also quite good.

It seems like they did the interior decor recently.  However, although quite nice-- they did try to bring a bit of Thailand with the wooden furniture I suppose, I wouldn't describe the atmosphere to be all that wonderful.  Also a little fancy to drop in just for lunch imo- cloth napkins and all.  Tries too hard, you know?"}
{"text":"THE BEST THAI DELIVERY in the west end .... the restautant itself is clean, but not the type of place you'd go for a romantic dinner ;-)"}
{"text":"Fairly boring. Nothing worth mentioning. 

Pad Thai? Should have been been \"Bad Thai.\""}
{"text":"My favourite neighbourhood Thai place.

The service is always quick and the food is delicious.

I highly recommend the shrimp Pad Thai. Not only is it amazing, it's only $8 or $9 and it will be more than enough for two people. Note that this is the take out portion. I'm not sure if the dine-in is the same size."}
{"text":"This is my go to local Thai restaurant.  The food is prepared amazingly quick and is priced very well for it's quality.  The portions are large , the waitressed are friendly, and they make you feel welcomed.  

The place is very clean and they have a great lunch and dinner buffet with a limited, yet satisfying selection of dishes.

Takeout takes no time, and they will deliver for orders over 50$.

Try their Red Curry. They green beans and bamboo shoots really give it a nutty yet sweet flavor."}
{"text":"Pad Thai was mediocre tasted like it was out of the box and unauthentic at all. 
Food is affordable so that's probably why the quality was so bad.
Service was good but no one was in there so that's probably why. 
Green curry was decent but I've had better."}
{"text":"Took almost an hour and they gave me some one else's order!   Second time they have screwed up!  Last time for me!  Ordered BBQ pork with green beans got BBQ beef with snow peas, ordered red curry chicken, couldn't taste curry over coconut!  Give this place a NEXT!"}
