{"text":"My friend and I came during the day so there wasn't so much people. The interior design was nice and simple. After we were seated, one of the workers came with menus, water and a sheet of paper to write down our order. We waited about 15 minutes for our dessert but we didn't mind because it gave us a feeling that they are putting effort in the food that they make. The store played pop songs and had free wifi but you would need to ask for the passcode. My friend and I also saw one of the workers making tang yeuns. We can tell the she also puts in all lot of effort in making good tasting food. I ordered sweet potato and white fungus. It had a strong ginger taste. Even tho I don't like ginger, I still thought it tasted good."}
{"text":"The pictures don't do this place justice, the dessert is so good and fresh, MUST TRY THE TOFU, everyone in the store had ordered one. The hot desserts are all so good. On the pricier side, but its not like i'm coming everyday. A BONUS: they close very late which is good for people who are late night eaters like me. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants real good Chinese dessert"}
{"text":"I've been to this Chinese dessert place on 2 occasions.  If it was all based on first impressions, I wouldn't have returned.  But I was at Times Square for dinner with my husband (we had pho at Kim Po) and felt like a dessert chaser.  Since we were already there, we decided to go back to Hx3.  The first time we were there, we ordered to fresh tofu dessert for 2 in the traditional wooden pail.  We also ordered a honeydew sago.  We had been on the hunt for some good fresh hot tofu dessert.  So we were excited to see this place offered what seemed like real thing.   It turned out to be a disappointment.  When it came, we took off the lid, took the scoop, and tried carefully to scoop the tofu dessert into the bowls.  One the very first scoop, the tofu dessert disintegrated into a hundred separate pieces and poured like a liquid into the bowls.  The tofu itself tasted like a puff of air... Nothing.  No texture.  It was Ike swallowing a  mouthful of air.  Once we got to the middle of the wooden pail, the scoops of tofu got a bit more solid.  It didn't disintegrate into a hundred pieces, but it still tasted like air.  I like my tofu dessert with a bit of \"bite\", and this one had nothing.  Even worse, the bottom of the wooden pail gave us sheets of overcooked tofu, like tofu sheets.  All in all, the tofu dessert, while it looked nice and promising, failed to deliver.  The honeydew sago dessert was equally disappointing.  I like my sago with a \"bite\" too, something I can actually chew (even if I can just swallow it).  This sago was like the tofu... Nothing but gulps of air.  The syrup wasn't sweet enough, and the honeydew pieces saved it a bit by adding some much needed sweetness to the gulps of air.  Our second visit brought better results.  My husband got the hot black and white sesame paste soup, and I got the boiled egg and milk with added ginger juice.  Both were well done and tasted good.  My boiled egg and milk had a good refreshing taste of ginger.  Our bill, along with a large cup of sweet herbal tea (a little bit TOO sweet), came to about $15.  I would return to Hx3, but only if I'm in the area.  The tofu dessert experience still haunts me."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Bad service. Some foods are way overpriced. Fish ball is 6.00. I went there with a friend, 2 desserts and fish balls costed me 41.00."}
{"text":"I have a sweet tooth issue like most girl.  My boyfirend has told me all about Chinese Hong Kong desserts..  How American desert is boring and unhealthy when comparing to Cinese desserts.  Here we are at \"Health Herb Harmony\".  11pm and the place is packed on a Monday night.  We literally have to wait 5 minutes for our seat.  All young Asian people hanging out, chatting and I am the only white girl.  The menu has many pictures and they looks delicious.  However, what caught my eyes are herb tea with following descriptions:  gentle the fire of your heart, flu clearing herb tea, toxin cleansing herb tea and many more.  I was impressed but my boyfriend told me these are tasted very bitter and I propably would not like them.  He has ordered a cold mango with herbal black jello dessert drink for me and a purple color pudding.  They are delightfully delicious.  It wasn't heavy or thick but just delicious.  Yep, delightful is the right word.  We have since going back every night and trying different stuffs.  How can a girl say no to dessert?"}
{"text":"We're 4 ppl went to there on Saturday night, crazy stuck up at the entrance. Nobody serving or asking seats arrange for all the customers. After we got a table, there are thousands desserts item on the menu, we needs to spend over 20 mins to read it all. Because the menu are too complicated not easy to understand for all the mix and match. All the items can add extra if you don't mind to pay extra. Is wondering taste after all the mixed???Finally we placed the orders, we needs to wait for 20 mins then got the first order. Then the order was coming one by one, we spent totally an hour to finished our 4 orders. My last coming order is just a Bubble Tea. I asked the waitress  to check with me in several times, but she just follow once and go to do for another things. I saw the bubble tea is ready from the kitchen and no one go to get it leave it there in 5 mins. Just a bubble tea needs to wait for 45 mins!!! This is ridiculous and taste like water with sugar, totally suck drink!!! I will never return to this place. Price experience, poor service, suck food!!!Highly recommend not going to this place!!!"}
{"text":"Came with friends and we ordered 4 desserts. Two came out wrong and when we asked to check the order, the server just said \"nope thats what you ordered\" without even checking. When they eventually did check they just came back silently and took the desserts back. The server didnt apologize and generally looked sour.  Onto the food, the sesame rice ball dough was too thick, the sweet tofu pudding was lumpy, and the black sesame paste was chunky.  Steam egg whites and milk with cashew paste tasted okay but was very watery.  There are many other better places to choose from."}
{"text":"Just got back to the hotel from this dessert place, very disappointed. Unacceptable!  Ordered Malaysian Cha Cha dessert (??)?there was no sago and no taro in it at all. It had a funny taste ... which is dried orange peel, why? No idea. We told the waitress, and apparently she had no idea what supposed to be in Cha Cha. So we didn't eat it at all. Later on, the manager told us Cha Cha is not supposed to have taro. I was like .. Really??? Alright just to prove that she was wrong, I googled it. The recipes I read on Google all have taro and sago.  For example: http://hd.stheadline.com/dining/recipe_content.asp?srid=13&rid=1822 Guess what .. the manager made us pay for it. WTH!!  Also, ordered the ginger favor streamed milk. That was a total disaster!!! It didn't solidified at all. It was like milk with ginger favor. And the waitress said she can re-stream it for me, it would be OK. However, I know how to make this dessert and I know it won't work. I told her it doesn't matter.  Since both desserts failed completely, I ordered the sago with taro in coconut milk. It was a OK one. Ended up paying it plus the Cha Cha.   What a ripe off and waste of time. I should have gone to Dessert Kitchen and ended my Toronto stay with a happy stomach. Now, all the dessert places are closed. I didn't get to eat dessert at all.   100% not going back to this place, and I will tell all my friends about my horrible experience.   Seriously the owner of this place, if you continue to serve people with this kind of dessert, I am sure you won't have any chance to survive until I visit Toronto next time. And if I could, I wanna give this place a negative star rating. So ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Authentic Dessert. Good taste. Service is ok, no smile, cold face. Overall, 2 star is the most I could give. Because dessert dishes have been overpriced, even doubled than market price. Won't go again."}
{"text":"I come here every single time I am in Toronto. This is one of my favorite dessert places. Wish they had a place like this back in New York!   Unfortunately I can't read Chinese and my Chinese is sub par so I don't know what majority of the things are called that I eat here. I look at pictures and try food that other people order. But you can refer to the pictures I posted and ask the workers there.  Some desserts I've tried and know the names: Durian pudding - ONLY recommended for people who like durian. This is an aquired taste and smelly dessert. Mango pancake Gui ling guo - don't know the english name."}
{"text":"Had a craving for Chinese desserts, and the other place in Time Square wasn't open, so gave this place a shot.   Didn't come in with high expectations and still left feeling underwhelmed.   1. Almond Paste - severely watered down, I also didn't like the powdery texture 2. Sesame Glutinous Balls - Overcooked & sesame paste inside tasted somewhat like cardboard 3. Slow Service - even when there's only two other tables  I guess I didn't order anything \"healthy\" but I'm not tempted to try anyways.   The Good: - Free Wifi - 10% off if you show your student card ID  - Easy parking  - Open late night - Herbal Tea supposingly will cool your 'internal fire'   *Insert \"not impressed\" meme*"}
{"text":"Came here on a busy Friday night. We weren't too sure how the seating was done, so we stood around for a few minutes before seating ourselves without being helped.  Once seated it took the servers around 20 minutes before they were able to help us. Granted, it was an extremely busy night with only two servers on the floor but that was still no excuse for the amount of time it took for someone to come and offer us water and ask us for the order.   Once our orders were placed, we waited ANOTHER half an hour before our food actually came out. I don't know if the service is usually this bad but we were very disappointed with the night that we went. Oh and the order sheet that you order from only has Chinese characters on it, so if you can't read Chinese, good luck playing mix and match with the menu.  The dessert was ok, but it was not worth the wait."}
{"text":"This is a big Chinese herbal dessert place. I very like going here because they have lots of room, so I don't have to fight for my seat or wait at the door.  The mango pancake. It had lots and lots of cream inside which I guess which made it tasted good because we were actually eating the cream. I think 85% were cream. The mango was sour, and it was kind of a great match with the cream. I have to say it was a nice treat but not worth the money because it costed $6.50 for this.   This ??? was alright...   ???? was alright too. There wasn't much ?? in it. The white radish was kind of dry."}
{"text":"Always love their fresh tofu pudding here. It is consistently hot, soft and comes with different types of sugar as a topping. Can't beat the wooden bucket presentation for the authentic flavour.   The menu also has a variety of herbal teas aimed at different symptoms. We ordered some flu tea as I was feeling under the weather. It was a bit pricey but perhaps its a placebo effect, I felt better afterwards.  Haven't tried their savoury menu but they do have a large selection so perhaps if you opt for a late night meal you can have a try."}
{"text":"It was weekday night, not busy time. Nobody greeted us when we entered there. The server was busy with her own stuff... They delivered the bill BEFORE we finish our food. (The whole restaurant is not busy. Nobody is waiting for seats. And we were there only around 30mins!) After paid, there supposed to be $12 bucks back. But, they never give back until we asked! It was NOT a pleasant experience!"}
{"text":"I ordered a take out of walnut soup/paste. But when I open the lid it's literally only 70% full. Like really?"}
{"text":"The place itself is tucked away nicely in Times Square.  I pass by Times Square many times but never noticed this place until recently.  I got the tofu dessert and it came in a wooden pail.  It was very smooth and tasty."}
{"text":"There's not many places where you can find traditional Chinese desserts but Health Herb Harmony is a good one.  The place is easy to find and located within Times Square plaza, one of the stores on the outside. Don't expect anything fancy for its interior - it's your standard sit and order restaurant. They are known for their menus under the glass table top!  I love this place for the fact their menu list is enormous and majority of items are customizable. You can order the simple steamed sweet egg to sweet soup that includes grass jelly, mango, watermelon, and sago all in one!  One of the most traditional dessert that have is the herbal essence jelly, supposingly made from turtle. This is a must try and helps bring good health."}
{"text":"When I'm craving Soy Bean Pudding...this is the place!  My girlfriend being Bulgarian is picky and she loves the fresh soy bean pudding made from scratch (allow 10 mins).  She loves reading the menu cause it never makes sense with straight Chinese to English translation.  It's always cute to share their bamboo container.  Usually $4.30 for a bowl of soy bean pudding but the fresh soy bean pudding for two person is $8.00 (Deal). They do have a 4 person bamboo container.  Their herbal tea is always good.  They have free WiFi and open late.  Best part, it's close to me. Markham isn't far from Richmond Hill but it's also off Highway 7."}
{"text":"Wahhh! I haven't been here in so long! Years even! They have some great stuff here too!  First things first! They have some of the best Tofu Pudding (Tofu Fa) in the area. Made in a wooden container, it is the softest around!   I came here last night for some late night snacks/desserts, and always have a satisfying ending! Ordered Sticky Rice Rolls, Curry Beef Balls, and a Lychee with Sago and Grass Jelly. All very good, though the beef balls could have had a spicier/richer curry sauce.   Service is always quite good, but the staff there are on the older side, so there may be a language barrier if you don't speak Chinese. They are definitely nice and always quick with any requests.   With the restaurant closing at 2AM, you can pretty much come any time! Come try out the different desserts, or even a meal (rice or soup combos)."}
{"text":"This place is a little hidden gems for those who aren't too familiar with the Chinese dessert concept. Depending on what you get, they have some good items that are \"beneficial\" for your health. My personal favorite would have to be the black turtle essence jelly served cold with a bit of sugar water. A lot of people come here for the bucket of tofu and for the ones who are big spenders and believers in bird nest's benefits then you will probably like the items that includes this ingredient."}
{"text":"A Hong Kong style Chinese dessert shop usually offers herbal, or tea-based, or fruity, or essence jelly type items that are supposed to be good for your health and balance out the sins otherwise.  And they usually open late, so the idea is to go late at night after a full dinner, eat more but this time the \"healthy\" dessert which will help restore your body harmony.  I don't know if I believe all these, but I am happy to eat desserts.    After eating way way too much at dinner and lots of spicy crabs, we came here to detox.  Essence jelly was A-okay, you can get it with sesame paste or other sweet soupy things which help mask bitterness of the Essence.  I had a sampling of what others had ordered, all pretty good but none really memorable.    Worth going if you are in the area."}
{"text":"If possible I would like to give -5 star, unfortunately I can't. Therefore, I gave this place a 1 start so that that I can put my review here. I ordered black and white sesame paste and it's worse than instant one that we can buy in any supermarket. Pomelo and sago in mango sweet soup taste like drinking del monte can fruit juice with mango not ripened at all or may be I should say the del monte can fruit juice taste better than this. I don't know how this place get 3 starts at all. My whole Toronto trip was ruined by this dessert place. I can't even use a word to describe these crap and we put them in where they belong to right away - trash..."}
{"text":"I couldn't understand why people keep flocking to this place, food quality is very so-so, service is terrible, price is high and there is plenty of competition in the neighborhood.   We ordered two dessert and one snack lst Saturday night. The snack (four little piece stuffed with fish mousse) was definitely the worst I have ever tried anywhere. Dry, stale and tasteless.   The two dessert was semi ok (steamed milk plus the house brand gello drink). The problem is that they came 40 minutes apart.   We are definitely not alone, as our next table guests have their three dishes paced almost like ours.   The bill came to be $25, just for reference."}
{"text":"Very disappointed this time around. Waitress made eye contact with me and went away when i tried to get her attention.  My food took forever to come out.  Service was so bad this time. I don't know what happened.    I also got the wrong order.  Sigh.  Then they forgot part of my order. When I reminded them (when everyone else was finished) it came out wrong as well.  I was tired of waiting so I just ate it anyways.  Food was still good though but just bad service.  Its a shame that they let service ruin what would have been a good experience as the desserts r yummy."}
{"text":"The dessert is quite good for toronto in terms of both breadth of menu and overall quality...but the service is quite poor"}
{"text":"The other Chinese dessert place in the same plaza (pun cao tong?) is way better. I got the mango sago with grass jelly and it was pretty bad. The mangos were soooo sour and clearly not fresh, the whole thing was just sour and did not mesh well together. Sad that I wasted $6.5 on that..."}
{"text":"Pros:  - Loved the soft tofu in the bucket. The presentation was adorable and the tofu was deliciously silky. Yummy! The tofu had less bean flavor than I prefer, but that didn't bother me too much.  - Service was prompt - Steamed papaya was good  Con: - The only con was that the pancake sesame rolls were not very good."}
{"text":"Come here if you like Chinese desserts, sweet soups and herbal essence jelly. Also serves Chinese snacks and rice in clay pots. Open late with lots of parking in Times Square."}
{"text":"I must admit that if I were to open a dessert place my first choice for a name would not be \"health herb harmony\" but alas this place specializes in Chinese desserts which is a world where the term \"healthy dessert\" is not an oxymoron but a sad reality.  A few of us yelpers came here after an elite event for a late night snack. Being in a big group I did get to try a few of their desserts and I did enjoy most of them. For my self I ordered the glutinous rice balls, one of my favourite Chinese desserts. The rice balls were quite big and draped with a generous portion of peanuts, they were pretty delicious. The dish that surprised me most was the tofu dessert which was very silky, and had a great texture. The tofu was served with some syrup to make it sweet; I would definitely order this again.   If you look in the far end of this restaurant you will see a giant gold contraption that looks like it could house a genie, this is used to make turtle essence jelly which I believe this place specializes in. I gave the turtle jelly a try, I've had the dish before and have never been a fan, it is way too bitter for my palate and the copious amount of fruit it is served with is still not enough to balance it out. However this version of turtle essence was less bitter than the previous ones I've had.    The restaurant itself is quite modest, and would be a good place to come post dinner for a light dessert. The menu has a wide range of items that includes a selection of bubble teas. If you are a novice to the world of Chinese dessert than you will likely require an Asian friend to help you out. All in all I had a pleasant experience, I would not go out of my way to come here but if I were in the area I might pop in for some tofu dessert (I never thought in a million years that I would utter those words)."}
{"text":"This place is truly a hit or miss and lately, it's always been a miss. Servers are not patient with you when you order and doesn't even bother to ask if you want your dessert hot or cold. I don't think I will be coming back anytime soon. There's so much other better dessert places on highway 7 and I rather they my money elsewhere. And, desserts are average price and portions are small.   $7 for half a bowl of mango dessert!! Way overpriced"}
{"text":"One of the more memorable days in a Yelper's journey...the day you hand out your first 1 star. I feel horrible for doing this. Like a teacher who has to tell the eager but talent lacking and lanky 5\"2 Logan that he just won't make the basketball team this year. But one can only improve with constructive criticism right? There's always next year Logan!   Sorry HHH, but your embarrassingly inept service and subpar food merited this status.  - The service: There's Chinese restaurant service...then there's Health Herb Harmony service. My friend received the wrong order 3 times. 3 times. For one order. At one point, she received  Peanut Butter Toast instead of Milk Toast. Milk doesn't even sound like Peanut Butter?! Where did the extra 3 syllables come from?! No apologies either. Waited for a total of 45 min for a simple Milk Toast to arrive. Made more errors in totalling the bill. Sigh. - I was so bitter at this point that it made my grass jelly and fruit bitter. Then I realized I was giving them too much credit and it was because my grass jelly and fruit was actually bitter. UGH. If I used the phrase I can't even, this would totally be when I CANT EVEN."}
{"text":"A Friday night, a fairly busy night for them... and just 2 people manning the front of store?!?!  Maybe that's the norm, but was just an observation.   Ordered 2 desserts that costed me $20 (tofu pudding dessert for 2 was already $10). They must've raised their prices since the last time I was here.   Desserts were alright. Not great. Not terrible. And certainly not $20 good.   Service was bare bare minimum. Older waitress shows up at table, takes order that WE marked down, brings us our dessert, and hard to get a hold of after that.   At the end when paying, she kept emphasizing (you could even say she demanded) I should pay tips as if she provided out of the world service and hospitality.  Sorry lady, inputting orders and bringing the food is part of your job description. You don't get tips for standing around and looking miserable.    TL;DR - Expensive - No service - Will milk every $ in your wallet cuz they know you won't be coming back"}
{"text":"This is one of those places I would just pass by but my friends wanted to go so I gave it a try. I actually very much enjoyed it but they told me my food was watered down...  Food: 3/5, I got the taro slush and it was good.  Service: 2/5, not very much other than bringing over the food.  Ambience: 3/5, odd seating with others but it was ok.  Price: 3/5, about $8 per person.  I enjoyed it so I will return."}
{"text":"it was after dinner and went to get some chinese dessert take out..paid $7.7 for a cup of sesame steam milk..got home and the portion was only half a cup..guess i should have paid $15 and might have got a full cup..o well."}
{"text":"We ordered dessert and a pan fried turnip cake to share... The dessert was fine but the turnip cake was what changed our experience. There was a piece of hair inside the turnip cake and we kindly asked the lady working to come over she looks at it and laughs and then asks us what would you like to do.. We were thinking nothing but we want you to know that this is a concern.. We were offer one piece of green pepper stuffed with fish as a replacement. That's fine... The next piece of turnip cake had a hair in it again so we waved her over again and informed her and she questioned us asking how it got there .. Well it's inside the mixture so obviously when you guys were making it the hair went inside and she said well I can't do anything for you.. At this point we didn't even care, we just wanted to inform you and let you know this is a problem please take this away ... and when we were given the bill she made it clear you need to pay for the turnip cake as I already gave you a piece of green pepper for free. That's great! Won't be coming back after this..."}
{"text":"Came here a few times.  The dessert is good, especially their almond soup.  We also love their tofu dessert, it's super light and fresh tasting.  Their service is a bit slow, and they got our order wrong.  The waitress also seemed a bit rude.  If it was busy, I would give them a break, but it wasn't."}
{"text":"This is my 'go-to' for Chinese dessert and herbal tea. I absolutely love 'sweet soup' and wished we had a place like this from where I'm from.  The dessert here is consistent and I come with friends as well- good place to chill and chat. The tofu dessert and papaya steamed milk are really good. Remember to order all the steamed dessert items right when you sit down since it takes at least 20mins to make. I also really enjoy the sesame and walnut sweet soup.  The herbal tea..24 herb tea is also well made here- the bittery goodness is all there.   I almost forgot to mention that this place also has food items on their menu and snacks as well. Do not worry you will also be able to satisfy your salty cravings and for those who do not have a sweet tooth, you won't be left out.  Definitely try this place as I wouldn't miss it whenever I am in Richmond hill even if it means take out. This place closes at 2am...so no excuses!"}
{"text":"Was going to rate this 4 star because of my first visit there and the fact that they are known in the richmond hill community for their Tofu-Fa which comes in a wooden pot with tofu and sweet mix as a form of chinese delicacy found in many dessert places.  However, recently got a mango milkshake from them 2-3 weeks back and must say that the service is starting to become pretty bad with the drink option being over priced and unsatisfactory.    I got the Mango Milkshake, and honestly, probably could have gotten something nicer with all the different bbt stores and chains around the area.  Must recommend will be the Tofu-Fa and maybe some of their more herbal creations, but if you want to get a drink, stick with the well known names like Chatime, PresoTea or even your friendly Starbucks to get your drink fixation."}
{"text":"This is a very quaint place, nestled in the Times Square mall which faces hwy 7.  Years ago I remember a Chinese desert place but it was on the other side, that one was very small with limited seating.  This place has ample seating and wifi.  The service here is very grumpy and indifferent.  If you've never come here before and have questions about the menu, good luck and I mean it.  We weren't sure what we wanted.  We wanted the tofu pudding and they asked us if it was for one, two, or four people.  We asked for one that serves two knowing we would share it.  While they say it serves two, it comes in a wooden pail and it is huge.  There's no way two people could finish that unless you were HUNGRY.  Anyways, asking for spoons or bowls again, indifferent.    There's a dessert shop in Market Village and the staff there are also grumpy, what is it with HK style dessert places, is being grumpy a pre-requisite?"}
{"text":"Service : 1/5 Environment : 3 / 5 Food & Drinks : 2.5 / 5 Price : 2.5 / 5  Overall : 9 / 20 \" Sub-Par \"  Comment - other than the tofu flower (dou fu fa) the rest of the desserts are just underwhelmed.   - service is non-existent, took me 3 times (10 minutes) to flag them down + 10 minutes for them to bring over my bill ... the wait for them to get change was even longer.  - parking was easy, but traffic on hwy 7 is horrible at all hours."}
{"text":"We enjoyed this place enough, but we found the prices were a bit much considering what you get. Me and my wife agreed that we could probably make the same thing at home for a lot less, but the desserts were still good."}
{"text":"A bit pricey but the food was good. The interior isn't modern, but the food that we are eating is traditional Chinese desserts so In that sense, the theme matches.  Not the comfiest place to seat, but overall not bad just expensive.  This would be a good place to go for the go to traditional Chinese desserts with your family.  This is something less fancy but more about the casual ambiance."}
{"text":"This dessert joint was right across the street from our hotel, basically a hop-skip-jump away.  It was about 10PM on a weekend and we were lucky enough to snag a table right before a huge rush of people came in. Their menu was huge and extensive: drinks, slushies, ice cream, sweet tofu, special chinese desserts with snow fungus and etc, and they also have food. I ordered a boiled/steamed papaya with egg and milk. It takes about 15-20mins to make. The steamed egg and milk was divine, so soft and not too sweet. I loved how the papaya flavor was infused lightly into the steamy and gelatinous mixture. By the looks of the crowd of people and the desserts they ordered, I bet most of the selections are really yummy. Can't wait to try another when I come back to Markham."}
{"text":"I am here again for a relaxing late night healthy meal.  I used to live in the area and would visit very often since it's one of the few good places around that are open till 2 am.  After all these years they still have great food and desserts.  I was told whenever I have a sore throat to come here for Assorted Herbal Tea. It's bitter but guess what it really works!  Drink it right when your throat starts feeling itchy.  Instant relief that works much better than those sore throat candies.  Tonight I ordered :  Great Soup Combo B  $13.50 -herbal essence soup -noodles in soup w/ steam chicken wings -coconut pudding w/ purple rice  The food was wonderful as always.  The soup noodles doesn't have much taste by itself so add in the veggies and eat with the chicken wings.  The soup and dessert was delicious as always.  The waiters are quite attentive, I remember short changing the cashier one time and he said it was ok.  Like many chinese establishments, this place is cash only.  Will definitely keep coming back here when I feel like having a healthy meal!"}
{"text":"Great vibes here. Really great for a hangout with friends and you want a quiet area to chit chat. Also, the desserts here are not to sweet which is great.   Items I get that I personally love are  - Sesame Rice Balls with Crushed Peanuts: (which have black sesame on the inside) - tastes so chewy and they come out warm!  - mango pudding: tastes sweet and creamy - Tofu Fa: steamed tofu with brown sugar or syrup on the side - great dessert for sharing between 2-4 people. Also comes hot/cold. I love hot for those cold winter months  - Durian Pancake: crepe on the outside with whipped cream and durian on the inside - Herbal Jelly: you can get this bitter or less bitter. It's VERY strong but having one is great for your body"}
{"text":"Dessert items were just as good as the first time.  Walnut soup - tasted great and would order again  Papaya sago - the papaya was not that good  Black glutinous rice with whole lychee balls was amazing  Tofu fa was ust as amazing as the first time."}
{"text":"3.5/5  I'm not much of a dessert person, but after having dinner at Ocean (see review for that place), I decided to come here to have dessert since Ocean doesn't offer dessert for their course menu.  The seniors on my table had the black sesame paste and enjoyed it. I had a mango pudding with evaporated milk. While it was good...there was too much milk in my pudding and I got milk over my clothing since it was dripping between bringing the mango from the plate to my mouth.  Service was quite good, but mind you we came at around 7:30pm...nowhere near peak hour for this restaurant. I won't add the +.5 since I expected good service if we're the only table being served.

{"text":"So I don't usually eat Chinese desserts..frankly, because I don't find it sweet enough and most of the time, the desserts are made from beans.  So when my friend suggested to try this place, I was quite hesitant.  To my surprise, the desserts were very tasty and for those who want something more Western, like a crepe, they have those too! I think this place is good for the young and old. Their dessert menu is extensive and they even have herbal teas and drinks for those who aren't interested in getting sweets.  We ordered the fruit bowl with tapioca and grass jelly, as well as the crepe with cream inside.  I definitely would come back here..probably with my parents who enjoy and appreciate their more signature desserts like black sesame soup, \"turtle\" soup, etc."}
{"text":"Very cute place to have some classic desserts. They have great tofu pudding that come in cute wooden containers and the option to add more or less ginger essence to the syrup. Also, their watermelon slush was pretty good, you can tell they didn't load it up with sugar because it wasn't crazy sweet like some bubble tea places."}
{"text":"This place is a hit or miss.. Some days are good and some days are disappointing.   There are not that many traditional Chinese dessert places in the area so this place is good to go late night for tofu dessert or some classic hk desserts..I remember hanging out here way back in high school!   This place is open quite late on weekends and offer a large variety of desserts, drinks and food.   The reason why I say it is a hit or miss is that I have had very watery tofu dessert before (in the wooden bucket) and some days it is the perfect consistency.   The price is reasonable as the average dessert is around $5-6. My favourite desert is the warm glutinous rice with coconut milk!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant accident!  My friend was told of a great dessert place in Times Square and had happened upon this one.  This wasn't the right spot, but it was deemed better than the one originally recommended.  So, here we went for dessert!  Super smooth tofu pudding served in cute covered wooden pails.  Delicious steamed egg with milk - get the whole egg version.  A mango crushed ice drink however would have been more enjoyable made with shaved ice.  Real food is also served at this dessert place, but we didn't get around to trying any.  When we ordered a cold dessert to-go along with our eat-in sweets, the first thing to come to the table was the bagged pudding.  Bad idea.  Cash only!!!  Tended to get busier later in the night.  ***8/2011***  According to the menu, they have wi-fi, and if you present an effective student card from any Ontario post-secondary institution you can receive 10% off."}
{"text":"i do not recommend the cocorn dessert. heavy for my sweet tooth.  mango sago pudding was good with the herbal jelly. YUMM. overall, was a decent place. wasn't that fond of the atmosphere, empty and bland. but the menu selection was awesome, could not decide what to get! it all looked good. would def return to try their other items! btw, the tofu dessert is amazing. comes in a wooden pail. must try if you're there."}
{"text":"From the food to service to decor, everything is less than mediocre.  I ordered the papaya steamed milk (not the whole papaya, but papaya pieces) and for 7$ I only got maybe 8 small sliced chopped up pieces of papaya in the whole bowl, that's a but of a rip off. Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"Great Yummy Dessert in Richmond Hill!"}
{"text":"The waitress took my order didnt very care what I want. Don't ce very welcome at all. I understand it may be late night (a around 9 ish ) when I passed by this place since I cannot find the one I wanted to go to.   The wait wasn't that long, the price seem decent but a bit pricy imo. But since I'm craving for some Chinese dessert,  I don't really care. I got took out.......omg how disappointed was I when I open the container when I got home. The container is only half filled!!!!!! So when I said it's pricy earlier...it very very pricy for such shitty small portion!!@  Beware when take out, they will reduce the size as much as possible and the food wasn't particular good also!!!!  Never going back again!!"}
{"text":"Me and my friend had the sago and tofu dessert. The desserts are extremely watery, not as good as back then. The waitress had a horrible attitude. Such a bad experience. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"Not recommended. Bad taste boiled fish ball in soy sauce... I gave around 10% tips because i was not happy with the food. Then the very rude owner won't let me go, she said I didn't pay enough tips!"}
{"text":"This is the worst sweet spot I had so far.  The zaza did not have a single piece of tarot or sago, which is the most basic ingredient for zaza.  When asked, none of the staff including the boss had a single idea.  If you want to open a shop, at least make sure you get the most basic dishes right and stop wasting your customers' time"}
{"text":"Its sad that places like this would find it hard to survive in NYC. Thank goodness I get to go here when I'm visiting Canada. We use to have a couple tong shui places but most have shut down. Glad I got to eat here. Service was friendly and food was delicious. I got the tofu-fa for 2 and a sesame paste steamed milk. Both were great. The wife wanted more of the sesame paste steamed milk so we ordered another. The waitress let us know that it would take about 15 minutes which we were fine with. If only we went here every night we were in Toronto and not just on the last night. Next time we go, we'll stay closer to Times square so we can have eat here every night. Need to also try their meal entrees which looks really good."}
{"text":"Craving Chinese desserts, this is probably my family's go-to location. The prices are reasonable and the menu selection (of both food and desserts) is vast.   However, their desserts are not mind-blowing.   I ordered the boiled egg white & milk And I found it lacking flavour compared to other plain boiled egg white + milk I've had at other dessert places. Nonetheless I still enjoyed the dessert and the texture was smooth.   I also tried the plain soya bean jelly and it comes out in a very awesome wooden steamer and the perfect spoon for scooping the dessert into your bowl. It was also very smooth and quite tasty (and you can adjust how much sugar you add). However, I feel like I could eat the 2 person portion all by myself, thus i find the cost a little pricey for the size.   Lastly we ordered their rice roll with mixed sauce. I was quite disappointed by how \"hard\" and chewy this dish was. You want these rice rolls to be soft and silky!   Overall, this Chinese dessert restaurant will most likely have the dessert you're craving for since its menu is endless, and the prices are reasonable. However, it will not be the best Chinese dessert you'll ever have."}
{"text":"My go-to for Chinese desserts, or \"tong sui\". I love love love their steamed milk/steamed eggs (\"dun lai\" or \"dun dan\"), which is like the insides of an egg tart. Also a fan of their small meals, which is satisfying and filling. Not fancy, or healthy, but satisfying.  My gripe is that their menu reads like the Tax Act. So many add-ons, and options, and combinations ready. I mean, customization is great, but the self-ordering menu is kinda like a scantron test from hell. I prefer to give my order verbally! And demonstrate my mediocre chinese!"}
{"text":"I really like this place despite its dated interior. All items are in front of you on the table itself as pictures and words, but there are so many it is hard to differentiate between one another and which ones are which. What makes it even more difficult is ordering on the piece of paper itself. I have tried ordering one or two items that I remember eating as a child from what the description gives you vaguely but each time it has eluded me, and in return I get something that I didn't really have an intention of ordering. Nevertheless I will order it just to try something new.   I always get the classic Tofu Fa in the bucket. I just feel more accomplished scooping it out myself, not that I am very good at it. But whatever. If you are not careful you can rack up quite a bill there if you want to try a big handful of desserts. I recommend just trying a few first, and adding more on as necessary."}
{"text":"Why i absolutely LOVE chinese desserts: 1. Variety : there's stuff in there I don't even know what it is 2. Taste: unlike regular dessert, chinese ones doesn't make you feel like all the sugar is stuck in the back of your throat. 3. It's healthy : yes . I sh** you not, tradidional chinese desserts provide good healthy benefits and taste amazing  Walking in 20 minutes before closing time, the owners were nice not to rush us, even though we were the last ones there.  Usually I would order the in-house special or traditional chinese desserts but I decide to go for the durian crepe instead. The chunky fat peice came out, I was expecting scoops of ice cream hidden in the crepe but instead, i found whipped cream :D the combination of the light whipped cream helps balance the strong taste of durian. For $7.50 each, I would expect a little more durian than a smear though"}
{"text":"Health Herbal Harmony is another Chinese desserts restaurant that serves Essence Jelly and other herbal remedy. It is located in Time Square with storefront facing Hwy 7.  Dropped by on a late Sunday afternoon. The restaurant was empty. The menu here is extensive with a lot of different selections and it will be great if you come with a group of people so everyone will find something they enjoy!   Have to get my fix for Essence Jelly as eating too much spicy food is not good for health, and Chinese believe that Essence Jelly can balance out the effect of NOT so healthy eating. This is especially true when the weather is hot!  They do serves afternoon tea set (2pm-6pm everyday) which are around $5 that seems to be good value. Which I definitely would be back to try out. Today I decided on the Essence jello with Fresh fruit mix with coconut milk. ($6.80+$0.6).  The portion here for sure is not as big as other places. However, the mixture of fruit is great, watermelon and mango are both so sweet and other fruits are all fresh.. thank you! no canned fruits in sight!  The essence jelly  is a lot bitter in taste than any other places in TO that I tried. They put  lingzhi in that too. Lingzhi is another herbal remedy that suppose to be good for your health. I am not sure if the Lingzhi gave it a really bitter taste or they use extra herbs when preparing their jelly. Any way, I am glad that I order it with fresh fruits and coconut milk. If not, it will taste more like a medicine!  Services are fast and friendly.   They do give 10% off non set menu if you have a full time student ID and with free Wifi, I can imagine a lot of younger customers would hang out here later in the evening.  Their website is really cool too.. and they even deliver to your house or you can order takeout online and then go pick it up!  Cash only!"}
{"text":"After finding our first choice for after-dinner dessert, the ever fickle Full House Desserts, was doing one of their \"We'll open for table service later but we're doing take-out in the meantime\" things, we picked up some pancakes to go but headed to Health Herb Harmony for sit-down desserts instead.    Casual, brightly lit space with lots of tables, with their enormous menu under the glass tabletops.  I'd like to say for better or for worse, but it was really probably for the worse, we ended up mostly ordering the sort of things we were hoping to get from Full House Desserts.  These were typical Chinese sweet soups like sesame soup, walnut soup, filled glutinous rice balls, and mango with tapioca and pomelo soup.  At least based on what we got, these didn't seem to be things Health Herb Harmony makes well, with the exception of the mango with tapioca and pomelo soup, which was bright and refreshing.    What their menu actually has plenty of are selections with herbal components (yes, in retrospect, I see the name of the restaurant is appropriate).  In any case, I tried ordering the lingzhi coffee b/c the picture of the lingzhi mushroom was intriguing (and someone later pointed out the rather large specimen on display at the restaurant) but can't say it appealed.  My friend concurred, although his was the mocha version, but that didn't change the consensus.  The best thing I sampled there was their boiled egg and milk custard, freshly made, hot and smooth.  In the end, I suppose with such an extensive menu, it makes sense that there are things Health Herb Harmony will make quite well, and others may just be mediocre.  Unfortunately for us, much of what we sampled wasn't so good, but I suspect we simply missed the mark on what would be better, especially after seeing the reviews afterwards.  I'd come back to try better reviewed items next time around."}
{"text":"Location : This place is located in Times Square. Woo Hoo. In Richmond Hill, not New York. Darn.     It is not inside the building, it's one of the outside businesses. Not facing the big centre parking lot, but facing Highway 7.   Parking: There is a tonne of free parking, and they have underground parking.   Name:  The place has a weird name. I makes me wonder if it was some sort of vitamin or natural remedy place originally.  Decor: It's bright and well lit. there are quite a few tables. From tables for 2 to tables for larger groups.  Not a fancy place, a typical simple decoration place.  Menu:   They have a very large menu. I've only ever had dessert food there. They have regular food too. I've never had it but everyone looks like they are loving it.    Food: I LOVE THE COCORN.   it's rice and corn mixed with evaporated milk. I like it with Strawberries ( see picture).  I've also had the tofu flower.  Which is warm soft tofu in warm sweet sugary water.   I love it.    Cost: It's pretty inexpensive, I like the quality of the food.   Service: Well sometimes, it is slow because there's not a lot of staff, and I have never seen anyone  smile, or have had anyone smile at me. That being said everyone is polite and that is all that really matters!!  Conclusion: I'll come back. We like to go here after meals. Check it out, I'm sure you'll be pleasantly surprised."}
