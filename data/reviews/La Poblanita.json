{"text":"Good people great food. Hole in the wall but the food was great. Drive thru ordered Kang fu shrimp Carne fries and milinesa torta.liked it all . Beef was very tender. Fried rice had flavor and minimal amount of grease. Will visit again anytime."}
{"text":"We went to this taco shop before going to a concert at Ak-Chin Pavilion. It was a convenient location to get a great Mexican dinner before a show. From the outside it didn't look like much, but they have a large menu, delicious food, and was sparkling clean inside. I was shocked when they brought our tacos out on real plates - they take pride in their food and presentation. Would definitely go back again when on this side of town."}
{"text":"Very good food. We had the mole chicken, asada burrito, asada tacos AND FINALLY sopes. Everything is very good and recommended. Will come again for sure."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorites places to eat Mexican food.  After the first time of eating there I can't resist on going back due to the quality of meat used and overall taste and flavor in all of its food.  Tortilla was soft and serving size was very large, once you go you won't be able to stop from going back."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to venture out and try this restaurant because we had seen the rave reviews and delicious looking pictures. When we arrived, it seemed to be a little sketchy because of the area, but trust me, the food is amazing. We ordered one shrimp burrito and 5 street style tacos (I chose to do 1 of each kind) and a large horchata to share. Let me tell you, it was soo bomb. We had to wait at least 10 minutes, but we could see the chefs prepare it through the see through window. They were very thorough and very friendly. When the food came, the presentation was so beautifully done and you can tell they put a whole lot of effort. The horchata was probably also one of the best I've ever drank. 

All in all, I hope to return again and try out more of their menu!"}
{"text":"EVERYTHING we ate was sooooo delicious! From the outside you would never think such greatness is inside! Enchiladas with the mole sauce and tacos Al Pastor were perfect!"}
{"text":"Best mexican little place ever!! Highly reccomend!get the horchat! Best I've ever tasted"}
{"text":"I came here blindly and was surprised of the quality and taste. I order the 5 carne Asada tacos. The meat was decent, the ingredients were fresh and the salsa was excellent. Everything had a taste of a home cooked meal. No canned food.

The horchata was home made and one of the best I've had in Phoenix.

Devoured my food before my food picture.
Amazingly they also have Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Sope was really good.. And the barbacoa burrito was good as well..I love this place best sopes in town."}
{"text":"Get out of your car and eat here!! Holy cow!  What an unexpected treat.    Way to go!"}
{"text":"This is my kind of place.  A small out-of-the-way place that only locals might know about.  It's not flashy.  It's all about the food.  We were in the area to attend the Fiesta Bowl.  After the game concluded . . . and using Yelp . . . we came across this place and headed over.  The food was really good and the people were as nice as could be.  The quantity we received was impressive too.  The only downside is that we don't live in the area and won't be able to regularly frequent this place."}
{"text":"Don't pass this place up, located in an awkward location and kinda on the sketchy side but you won't regret it. Also don't be intimidated by the small menu sometimes less is better. I highly recommend the chipotle chicken sopes. If you're in the mood for quality tasting Mexican street food give this place a chance. 

Only con: Hardly any meat in the tacos."}
{"text":"We stumbled on this place a while back and decided to try it. I am very picky with street tacos and let me just say I was impressed. The meat has flavor, it isn't fatty like most places and they get an A+ for presentation. They have a little salsa bar so you can choose the level of spice you like. Today was my third time eating here and I can say I still love the carne asada street tacos, the meat has remained consistent in flavor and quality. I have tried so many places around the valley looking for good quality street tacos that were similar to those from NorCal and had been disappointed every time until I had them here. Plus the service is great, the place is always clean and the family that runs it is always friendly. I haven't deviated from the street tacos but my husband said the carne asada burritos were good. If you are in the area, stop in and give it a try!"}
{"text":"I can't even begin to describe the delicious flavor and quality of everything prepared here. This place is beyond amazing! The meat is full of delicious flavors from the marinade and was very tender and cut perfectly. No fat or gristle. Just smooth tender cuts of quality meat. We had the green chile burrito and five steak street tacos. They were both mouth watering and too delicious to put into words. All I can say is that I never finish a burrito and this one left me licking my fingers up until the very last bite. Even the tortillas are delicious! And the hibiscus tea is so fresh and clean. And the heart of the people who are preparing this food is full of pride for the love they put into their food. They are so deeply genuine and kind. This is our new favorite mexican place. They even offer a drive thru option. The location leads to this place being a true sleeper. But once you eat there you will find that you won't mind driving across town for it. Thank you everyone at La Poblanita's! You are all so amazing at what you do! Keep spreading the love and feeding the people with your loving food. With much gratitude!"}
{"text":"Very happy with how clean it was in there especially the restroom! I can't eat in a place with a nasty restroom! You think to yourself if the restroom looks like this what's the kitchen look like.. But anyway, the meat is on point with the taste. That being said the meat is a little chewy like it came from an old cow. The beans are a little spicy at least for this white girl. Both the rice & beans are on the bland side. Now the portion size is what you'd expect for the price your paying. The gentleman at the front taking the orders & serving you is very polite, friendly & helpful! Would I go here again, Yes but only for some street tacos or one of their big fat burritos."}
{"text":"La poblanita had really Good customer service, I had Enchiladas Poblanas with Rice really good Seasoning, I highly recommend La poblanita. Authentic Poblana Food."}
{"text":"This little taco stand outside the grocery is one of the best I have eaten. Cheap and fast, the tacos are traditional street food with great flavor. My son loves to go here and he is very picky about food. I have had chicken, beef, pork and pineapple, and chorizo. All are delicious but the chorizo are my favorite. Make sure to order and pay inside first but most importantly make sure you go!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem !!!!
Love the food !!! The restaurant is family owned and they are super friendly !! Definitely recommend and will be coming back"}
{"text":"Food was good and would eat here again if I was in the area. Had four street tacos (asada, pastor, chicken) and the Kunfu Dragon Bowl. The tacos were better than the bowl but the bowl wasn't bad.

Washed it down with a Horchata which was really good.

One star off for not serving chips and salsa and the trashy lady that came in to sit at the table and argue with someone on her cell phone. She was yelling and cursing and I've not heard the f'bomb that much since my time in the Navy. I would have thought that management would have kicked her out since she wasn't a customer and she was creating such a scene in the dining room."}
{"text":"Clean, simple and quality food make this place a true winner.  Flavor is the true king here.

Limpia, simple y buena calidad de la comida, me gana ina buena razón volver otra vez.  El sabor triunfa todo aquí."}
{"text":"Stopped by after work for dinner. Delicious!! And fresh! We ordered green chile burrito /wet style \"enchilada style\". First off it was huge! 6 bucks for it. You can definitely share. Real made from scratch enchilada sauce. The tortilla, green chile. Fresh! My husband is from Michoacan. Loved it. I had the sopes, barbacoa, asada, and adobada. The meat cooked perfect, not salty or runny. Just delicious. My friend had the tacos. Tortillas fresh good meat and flavor. And their salsas are good. And horchsta from a tub not a machine so good. Definitely going back. Price is good for good food."}
{"text":"So much hype on this place so I had to check it out! The taco stand is located outside of an old gas station, and there is a sign to go inside to order and pay. The cashier was friendly and explained that all tacos are $2.50--any meat (chicken fajita, chicken, chorizo, pork with pineapples, steak, and a few others) and the quesadillas were $4/each. I ordered 3, and went outside to wait for it to be prepared. In less than 2-3min I had 3 tacos that looked so delicious I couldn't wait to dig in. They have a few tables up outside where the gas pumps used to be, and have enough seats for prob 25-30ppl. Def not fancy, but a good place to sit and eat. There is also a salsa bar that has fresh pico, guacamole (that was more like a thin sauce) and cilantro and onions. I tried a little of everything-- including the mild salsa verde, which I thought had a bit of a kick to it!The chicken was so good, as was the pork with pineapple. The steak taco was chewy and had some fat, but maybe I just got a bad cut. I will definitely be back soon!!
Go... and Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Poblanita is Better than the other competitors in the neighborhood within a 1 mile radius, every direction. Very clean and friendly customer service."}
{"text":"We tried tacos al pastor, barbacoa, and asada. All very delicious with great flavor. Two options for salsas green and red. Both were really good. They had little spiciness to them. And we're great with the tacos. The service was great. Very nice people and polite. I will definitely recommend this place. Can't wait to come back and try new things on the menu. Lots of options."}
{"text":"The food is awful compared to Las Palamas in Beechview or even a Taco Bell. Flavorless tacos and watered down salsas. I wouldn't think the food was made my Mexicans if they didn't make it in front of me"}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie, this place looks a little sketchy when you first see it, but that has never stopped me. We went for the first time about a month ago and have been back ummmm 6 or so times... So yeah, its good and REALLY cheap. I stick with the chicken fajita (tacos or quesadilla). My husband has tried other stuff, but he also likes the chicken too."}
{"text":"best place we ate at during our trip to Arizona the tacos were amazing, the Orchata was refreshing"}
{"text":"The mole chicken is very good!!! The horchata is fresh made on site and ridiculously great tasting."}
{"text":"The burritos were amazing the place is very clean the tacos were real good as well
Everything made from scratch"}
{"text":"BEST PLACE EVER!!!! Tacos are the best tasting tacos I've ever had in my 22 years of life! Great customer service and AMAZING food!! I hope they never go out of business! I love this place!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin? I tried this place because I read the yelp reviews and now that I go here so often, I feel like family.

This is a family owned restaurant and it makes all the 'bertos restaurants look like ghetto Taco Bell. Raymond is part of the family and I see him almost every time I go through the drive thru. He is the friendliest most caring guy, and he knows how much I love their salsas.  His mom makes the BEST habanero salsa, and here's what makes this place a hidden gem- they always have a different salsa every week along with the salsas they have on a regular basis, and they are fresh and unforgettable. I can go on and on about the different kick ass salsas I've tried,  but the only way you can experience it, is if you stop by. 

Carne Asada burritos and tacos are my favorite!! 

Shrimp tacos- these are decent sized tasty tacos, and the shrimp is seasoned. I will a share pic.

Carne Asada fries- these babies are smothered and covered, soo good!

Green chile beef- delicious with a little kick. 

I want to try everything on the menu! I love when I find places like that. This family knows their way around the kitchen. I love them! I hope they're still around when I get old."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch today, I saw all the great reviews on yelp. We had carne asada street tacos, and rolled tacos. My hubby loves street tacos and tries them if they serve them. I must say they were very good, I liked them better than the rolled ones. We couldn't understand why we were the only ones there, that is not a good sign for lunch and on a Friday. We did like the covered containers of sauces, but nothing to say which was mild or hot. So we just tried a couple, hubby liked the green, I liked the red. The whole place was clean and neat, I couldn't figure out where the restroom is as there were no signs and no door except where she came through with our food. I liked the post for hand sanitizer because of course tacos are eaten with your hands. I had the horchata, which I've had a few places even at a pizza place, and this one was very good. I'm definitely going back if in that area, it's very far from home, we were going to a business in that area why we went today. I want to try some of the other dishes offered. Actually a few items I've never tried before on the menu. But I think we started with 2 we did enjoy."}
{"text":"Cinco de Mayo is perhaps the most emblematic example of our long, strange, and so often contradictory relationship with Mexico.  Americans are regularly horrified at drug violence and government corruption in Mexico, yet we spend like drunken sailors at Mexican resorts.  Americans complain that Mexican migrants take American jobs and tax dollars, but we happily accept the cheap labor they bring to our service industries.  Americans lament that the US will soon no longer be a majority white English speaking nation.  Yet every May 5th Americans everywhere have blow out parties to celebrate what is in Mexico nothing more than a regional holiday.  I admittedly am one such boneheaded American who has spent most of his life celebrating May 5th as Mexico's Independence Day for no apparent reason other than to throw a party with great Mexican food and beverage (or at least what passes for each).  In fact it was only a few years ago that I realized I'd been doing this all wrong after reading a stern Phoenix New Times article, revealing the truth that I could've easily discovered if I'd bothered to Google it.

For those unaware, May 5th is not Mexican Independence Day (that's actually September 16th).  But Cinco de Mayo is actually a day worth celebrating here in America.  May 5th actually commemorates the Battle of Puebla in which an outnumbered and poorly equipped Mexican Army defeated the more numeric and better equipped French Army in Puebla, Mexico.  The victory was little more than a morale boost for the Mexicans however as the French eventually overran the Mexicans days later.  But by keeping the French busy, the Mexicans prevented the French from accomplishing another one of their military goals.  Aiding the South economically and militarily during the American Civil War.  So while Cinco De Mayo is a relatively minor battle in the long history of Mexico, it is enormous in terms of the implications it had in helping to end slavery in America.

Now that you've gotten your history lesson for the day, let's talk commemorating this holiday properly.  In Puebla, they don't celebrate with oversized sombreros, tacos, and margaritas.  What they do take part in is historical reenactments, the obligatory parade, a day off from work, and the folks in Puebla gorge themselves with Mole (pronounced Mo-Lay).  More specifically, the iconic Mole Poblano.  Widely regarded as one of Mexico's most iconic dishes, this incredibly complex and complicated sauce contains around two dozen ingredients (peppers and chocolate being the most pronounced) and is usually reserved for special occasions.  I've had mole at different points in my life, but even in a city as prominently dotted in Mexican food as Phoenix, finding mole at a Mexican establishment can be a challenge.  Finding Mole Poblano specifically?  Harder still.  Which brings me to this small drive thru Mexican restaurant on the west side of 75th Avenue just south of Indian School Road.  La Poblanita is a clean, friendly, and otherwise unassuming Mexican food spot.  Except for the fact that they have the Pueblan classic Mole Poblano on their menu daily.  Thus why I'm here.

Here you order Mole Poblano atop chicken (or pollo) as a combo meal with rice and beans on the side.  The order also comes with some hot corn tortillas to make your own mole tacos.  I also got a Horchata and a Flan as a cooling respite for my taste buds from the spice of the mole.  Total cost including tax came to $18.  In less than 5 minutes, my order arrived at my table (in addition to the drive thru, there's seating for about 25-30 inside).  The mole doused chicken was quite literally fall off the bone tender, making it easy for taco making.  As for the mole sauce itself?  Spicy and deliciously complex.  If you've never had mole you'll probably spend your first time trying to figure out the dozens of flavors going on inside your mouth.  Its that complex and that complicated to make.  Fantastic dish all around.  The Horchata was spot on with those tasty cinnamon notes you'd expect.  The Flan was actually quite a bit denser than most flans I've had elsewhere, but still with that same delicious spongy, caramel-like texture.

La Poblanita may be out of the way for many and is barely noticeable from the street, but believe me when I say the Mole alone is worth the trip.  So to recap what we've learned today.  Cinco de Mayo is not Mexican Independence Day, we owe the Mexicans big time for helping to end slavery in America, and remember to try and commemorate the holiday the way the Pueblans do.  With a well made Mole Poblano.  If you wanna go on partying with your oversized sombreros, fake mustaches and ponchos, that's your call.  But just be sure to remember that whatever you may think of Mexico in the abstract, Cinco de Mayo is a holiday we should learn to celebrate for the right reasons.  Gracias Puebla y gracias La Poblanita."}
{"text":"In town on business and wanted try something local and awesome.  They have excellent food.  Friendly staff and very clean.  The street tacos are fantastic green chili and chipotle.  Their habanero Salsa is fantastic with just enough heat.  Went 2 days in a row."}
{"text":"Great little taco stand and grocery store.  Employees have all been extremely nice.  All tacos, fajitas are with the corn shell. Loved the salsas they have.  I will say the fajitas need more vegetables on them.  All are $2.50/each.  I've been trying the little treats, dried fruits inside also.  Most have been very good.  Kind of makes me feel like I'm on a mini vacation.  They also have alot of various peppers for purchase, a deli counter & cooler with various pops & fruit juices.  They have recently added some picnic tables too."}
{"text":"This is the best taco spot in at least a 25-mile radius, maybe even 30. My only gripe is that I wish they offered topping suggestions as I know certain meats should have red salsa, others green salsa, others a little lime squeezy. Though I grew up with tacos all my live, I don't always remember the proper accompaniment. They offer legit classics, like lengua y cabeza. They also offer a spicy habanero salsa that leaves your lips with memories of tacos long after they're gone. Try them all and figure out which is your fave. My nom-nom-nom mate ordered a quesadilla which she enjoyed, but I think I'm going to run thru the tacos first! Let me know which is your fave??"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good.  I tried the shrimp tacos which i wanted to try the fish tacos as well but they dont let you mix and match the tacos. You either order 3 fish or shrimp tacos which i got full after 1 of coarse i ate the second one because it was good couldnt get to the third one though.  I think they should let people mix the shrimp and fish tacos there the same price and then it switches up the flavor.  Anyways i will be back."}
{"text":"Was in the area and decided to give this Mexican restaurant a try. I saw a sign on their window for pupusas and that got me excited! Ordered the bean and cheese pupusas, chicken street tacos and an horchata. Service was a little slow getting the food but the guys working here did their best with the Father's day crowd. Pupusas were GREAT! Perfectly cooked and the flavor was on point. My chicken street tacos were also flavorful. My horchata was bit on the gritty side, not sure if it was the end of the batch. The only thing I'd change here is the condiment bar. You have to keep asking for sauce cups, because they only gave my companion and I one to share. Overall, delicious lunch, I will be back. ;-)"}
{"text":"We were in late at night about 40min before closing and the staff was so amazing in offering us opinions and advice on food that we may like to try (as this was our first time there). My husband ordered the green chili sope, OMG that was so delicious lol my husband said hands down that was the best sope he's had! I ordered one of each meat street taco and I was pleasantly surprised by the punch of flavor there is to each and every taco. We will definitely be coming back! 5 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"La mejor comida con un sabor auténtico poblano.  Las mejores cemitas y el mejor mole poblano en Phoenix  muy recomendable."}
{"text":"Great Food, great service & food presentation. Can't beat these prices with these authentic flavors.  I hope they start selling cafe de holla soon!"}
{"text":"Very nice very clean great people food was fantastic the burrito wet style is delicious not much to look at size-wise but great people easy menu and the food is worth the time"}
{"text":"As I write this, I just could not believe this place had 36 five star reviews. My co-driver and I were in from out of town, found this place on Yelp! And had to give it a go. 

First glance, a hole in the wall place I would not give a second thought to just driving right on by. But we squeezed the tractor past the drive-thru window and parked in the back. 

Oddly it was not busy at 6pm on a Wednesday night. After eating here, this place should be slam packed. 

Excellent scratch made food. Perfect flavors, and just the right amount of spicy kick. We had the Green Chile Beef Burritos, enchilada style, with a side of chips and salsa.  

The burrito was clean, well portioned, and unbelievably delicious. The salsa available included a creamy habanero that had just the right amount of heat. 

The gentlemen who took care of us came out to check on our satisfaction. We could not give them any more or higher praise. Job well done, guys!"}
{"text":"An authentic Mexican taco stand. You can trust that because most of the signs were in Spanish.

Great soft tacos cooked on the grill. Lots of toppings to choose from (including roasted  jalapeno peppers. The guacamole topping was rather soupy, but that's my one complaint.

There are picnic tables where you can sit outside, underneath the former gas station overhang. 

Some cold drinks from the cooler, mango or guava, and you are all set.

You order and pay inside at the counter, and the cashier gives you a little post-it note to take outside to the chef.

Nothing but a cool scene, and for an excellent low price."}
{"text":"We love stopping at this taco stand/Mexican grocer for a wonderful lunch. It reminds us of taco stands on the west coast. The prices are excellent and the service is great. Very authentic."}
{"text":"This place is LEGIT!  Every single bite was a party in my mouth!!  ...and it was just Mexican food.  No joke!  These guys aren't your typical cooks, they cook like Chefs and were so attentive.

I'm in the area a lot.  Thanks to fellow Yelpers, my family and I were able to enjoy - hands down - the BEST TACOS IN PHOENIX.  I would've never stopped by this restaurant but was craving some authentic Mexican food; and that it was.

I expected a small Menu but it actually was quite difficult to make up our minds on one single entrée. I wanted to try each of the tacos, so I had an order of 5 tacos... (shredded beef) Barbacoa, (beef) Asada, (pork) al Pastor, Chipotle Chicken, and Green Chilli Beef.  WOWZA!  Every single bite was full of flavor!  They were topped with onion, cilantro, and purple cabbage; served with a side of limes.  I didn't have to add anything.  As I ate my food, I could tell that someone had specialized in sauces.  None of the tacos tasted alike, almost as if a different cook had prepared each one.  My favorite was the Asada tacos but holy moly, I was the most surprised by the Green Chilli Beef tacos.  If you enjoy a mix of flavor, spice and a good kick of spicy all in one mouthwatering bite, try their Green Chilli Beef tacos.  The tortillas were good too; toasted and crispy edges.    

All their food was served eloquently; including their dessert!  We ordered three churros, served warm and stuffed cream, coated with sugar, and drizzled with chocolate.  Unfortunately, they were soooo good that there was no time for a photo op - sorry!!   

As for drinks, we ordered their \"aguas\" (naturally flavored juices) and their Jamaica was strong!  Very rich in flavor, probably the most potent flavor (infusion of dried red hibiscus) I've ever tried, not even homemade.  We also ordered their Horchata, and that was flavorful too.         

We had kids with us....ages 3-14.  We weren't sure how they were going to handle any of the typical spices in Mexican food.  They were kind enough to have us taste the Chipotle chicken but also offered to prep their tacos with their \"plain chicken.\"  It wasn't plain at all, the \"plain chicken\" had a lot of flavor and they didn't leave anything behind. 

By the way, they also have Asian bowls! Orange chicken, Teriyaki chicken, and one that they've named Kunfu Dragon bowl.  After speaking to one of the cooks and asking them about their strong homemade flavors, he told us that they had over 20 yrs experience working with Japanese food and the reason they took pride in seasoning their food so well and serving it eloquently.  We will be trying that on our next visit.   

Inside the restaurant, everything is colorful and inviting.  Spacious, clean and SPOTLESS!  The only downside to this location is that their restroom is in the back of the building at this time.  For our safety, the back gate is locked but they will unlock it for you to come inside and use it.  Sounds like they're remodeling that part of the restaurant.    

It is hidden in a stand-alone but odd location.  It sits in the middle of three independent car shops and a housing community.  It is directly across from Baskin Robins, (the Family Dollar shopping center) so that will help if you're looking for it.  It is the smallest but most colorful building on the block; southwest of 75th Ave & Indian School Rd.  They've only been there for 5 or 6 months and based on their traffic when we were there, people don't know of this hidden gem!  You won't regret it and you WILL BE BACK!  

Their most recent sanitary inspection is posted, taking place on 08/17/2016; with an \"A\" rating.  

They have a Drive-thru too!"}
{"text":"I was craving tacos.  My parents live on the Westside of Phoenix and I found this place.  When I drove up I realized that this was the place that I've been coming to for awhile but always seemed have a different name and owned by someone new.  I believe it was the owner that greeted me when I came in.  He was very nice and asked me if there was something I was looking for.  I said \"tacos\"!  He told me that the carnitas were on special.  I ordered the carnitas as well as the carne asada and al pastor.  There was a salsa bar with the pickled carrots and some kind of grilled onions and chili mixture.  I got both as well as the fresh green and red salsa.  All of the tacos were great!  The presentation was nice and there was lots of meat.  You can tell everything was fresh and prepared when you ordered it.  I was so glad that the taco's weren't greasy.  Sometimes the corn tortillas are drenched in grease.  This is definitely a place I'd come back to next time I'm in town.  I just hope that they stick around for awhile."}
{"text":"Two visits in two days? You better believe it.  I'm a West Coast native who spent a good part of my adulthood so far living in Southern California.  So I know from good tacos.  Ahem--good *street style* tacos. None of that hard shell or flour tortilla nonsense here. I came here with a friend and I got one of each from chicken, ground beef, chorizo, and pork with pineapple.  The meat was plentiful and juicy, and most of it was very flavorful. The chicken and chorizo were my favorites, although tbh the ground beef and pork were only \"eh\". What helps a lot is that there IS a nice little toppings bar on the side.  They have pico de gallo, a loose guacamole, salsa verde, hot salsa, diced onions, cilantro, limes, and what looks like a rotational offering of a cold garnish--yesterday it was charred jalapenos. Lord help me if they ever offer spicy pickled carrots. The only downside is that you get SO much meat that it's hard to contain it all in the tortillas, and there don't appear to be plastic forks on offer. Note to self: bring a fork.

Know the ordering system before you go: pay inside and bring a sticky note with the # of your selections to the cook outside.  You tell the cook which specific items that you want.  It works really well because having the cook do the cashiering on top of cooking up that delicious meat would really slow you down.

Oh by the way, I know that most everyone comes for the tacos, but it's a Mexican grocery store too.  It has all kinds of products that take me back to the little places all over San Diego, which has products that would make your Abuela happy to use, as well as a carniceria counter.  The only thing that I wish that they would offer is fresh pan dulce.  They have some packaged conchas, but what I wouldn't give for a panaderia-style marranito to go with some coffee. Mmmm."}
{"text":"First visit, the alambre burro was delicious. Green sauce on the burro was spicy. We like spicey. #11 was perfect size for a lite eater. Presentation excellent."}
{"text":"We ordered the carne asada tacos and a carne asada burrito. It was delicious, very filling and the meat had great flavor. The tortillas used were really soft and didn't get hard like the other street tacos. This place is very clean and we were the only ones here at one point.  Only thing that kept away from a 5 star is they desperately need better salsa. We had both red and green and I can say it was below average. Great customer service."}
{"text":"Wow this place is great! It's only about $2.50 a taco. You pay inside and they give you a sticky note to give to the cook out front. You can pick what you want I got chicken, steak, and pork. They have a toppings cart right next to the cook and I selected: guacamole sauce, pico de Gallo, medium salsa, & cilantro on each taco. I kinda wish they had cheese and sour cream too, but that's alright still excellent either way. Also don't forget to use the lime wedges for more flavor too. All three tacos were equally great and I highly encourage you try this place out."}
{"text":"Do not judge this book by its cover! La Poblanita - Tacos y Burritos looks like most Mexican fast-food restaurants around the valley. Trust me when I say, the food being served inside is miles ahead of whatever was served by the former tenant.

I chose La Poblanita for dinner this past Saturday night based on the Yelp! reviews. In a nut shell, this is a humble Mexican fast food restaurant that makes simple, yet elevated, Mexican food. Raymundo (who took our order) is extremely friendly and outgoing. He followed up during and after our meal and is very good at his job.

I won't ding a place for serving their specialty on styrofoam. Neither will I gush for no reason over the fancier than expected plates being used. In this case, there is a reason for the fancier plates. The food being served deserves some extra attention.

My friend and I chose a variety of items for our dinner to sample a larger cross section of their menu. We selected the Five Taco Plate (one of each) and a cheese quesadilla plus a side of rice and a side of beans. I like the fact that no one asked me \"flour or corn?\" I prefer corn and that's how the street tacos came out.

I can't say I tasted each taco because they are too small to share (my dinner company expressed his approval for his tacos). But I enjoyed each taco I had, especially the Carne Asada. Each is simple and delicious, period. The salsa selection is limited, but you likely won't need it. Most of the flavor is already on those little corn tortillas.

The quesadilla was average, but it was only cheese after all. The rice and beans held their own though. Clearly, home made!

Our meal at La Poblanita was a pretty good deal too. For not selecting a combo, ordering randomly, adding two sides and two drinks, we felt lucky getting out with a $20 tab. And once you try the food, you will agree, they should be charging more than $1.25 for the tacos. Viva La Poblanita!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat, & very authentic! Prices are great. We ordered cemitas & one can definitely be for two people. Highly recommend if your in the area and want to try traditional Poblana Food! Service is also great!"}
{"text":"My family and I had visited this place August of 2016 after having visited from out of town. We loved it. We thought the food was delicious. We were back in Phoenix, and decided we wanted to come back. The food was not as good. The food was lacking flavor. In my opinion, the staff are more occupied with presentation than flavors. It's a street taco. I don't need fancy presentation, and a fancy plate. I would eat amazing street tacos off paper plates and be very content. The staff members are very nice and polite. I will not knock their customer service."}
{"text":"I been nicer more establish taco infused restaurants, and this establishment was as good or better without outrageous price. Thank you for superior meal."}
{"text":"Found this place using Yelp, and it's a pretty solid 4 stars.  The food is pretty good, no complaints.  One thing that was outstanding was the chile verde. I had the chile verde in a street taco and it was delicious!
The staff is super friendly and helpful.  Even though we arrived 10-15 minutes before closing, they didn't hold back.  You can tell with the wonderful presentation of the food (photos added) that they are consistent no matter the time of the day you arrive."}
{"text":"Seriously the best burrito I've ever had, the asada is delicious. My husband had tacos and they were also awesome.  The place is spotless inside,  and the people working there are so nice.  Will definitely be back....soon."}
{"text":"My friends and I were  looking for fresh food for a reasonable price. So we thought we would give Poblanita a try.

The food was better than the reviews give it credit for. We ordered a variety of food, carne asada tacos, chips & salsa, green chili, rolled tacos, rice, and beans.  All the food we ordered was really very good and had nice flavor and the right amount of heat. 

The staff was friendly and accommodating, and the restraunt was very clean, in fact the staff was  constantly cleaning and it showed.

If your in the area stop by andbgive Piblanita a try."}
{"text":"My friend and I saw this place on Yelp and decided to try it out. We each had the street tacos, and chose to try all 5 kinds. The green chile and al pastor were my favorites! So much flavor, just enough filling, and great tortillas! Make sure to get the guacamole, more of a salsa style guacamole, but it was delicious!! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food is good, the accuracy of order and service is terrible. The green chile beef is nice and spicy. Unfortunately my combo arrived with tacos and rice, no beans. One of our party ordered chicken burrito, which arrived as an asada burrito. The food took way too long, there was only one other table of 3 when we ordered. I may come back to see if it was an anomlie, but probably not. There are other great mexican food restaurants around, like Popos, they are consistently good on all fronts."}
{"text":"Excellent food. The mole is authentic. The servings were like from a 5 star restaurant. Really nice people. Ask them about the history. My wife was angry going in and very happy going out. If you want authentic Mexican food, come here."}
{"text":"This place is so amazing! Classy, delicious, awesome bang for your buck. Our group got the fish tacos, al pastor tacos, veggie burrito, chicken bowl, and al pastor burrito. Everyone loved 'am! Shrimp tacos were a favorite and all types of tortillas were fresh. A bit of spicy-ness included in every dish. Cute atmosphere too, food served on classy white plates with metal taco holders. Highly recomend!"}
{"text":"Real good tacos and price is legit as well! Didn't care for the green Chile but the pork was on point! Fantastic!"}
{"text":"I had heard several great things about this taco stand and finally was able to try it out. The food was delicious and the people running the store and the stand were very nice. I would definitely recommend. Only, caveat is that there is not any indoor seating."}
{"text":"Dont judge a book by its cover completely describes this AMAZING PLACE . SUCH GREAT FOOD AND SERVICE . I usually never write reviews but this deserves one. It is truly a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"This place is bomb they are very nice and the food good too and price good fast service"}
{"text":"Clean good food service is good been here a few times tried a few things the smothered rolled tacitos are always good."}
{"text":"Well deserved 5 stars! 

I come here pretty often just cause the food is super fresh and always delicious! They have a variety of food in case you  would like to try something different.

The burrito bowl is delicious!!! With some chips on the side and some red salsa! The quesadilla de alambre is also to die for; it has a mixture of meats which together it is a whole Tornado of flavors! 

Then there is the mole poblano, by far one of my favorites! I've talked to the owners and they make this fresh everyday! All the ingredients the traditional mole should have. 

I mean I haven't tried EVERYTHING on their menu but I could definitely guess that it would be good! The owners are really nice! It's almost like dinning at home! LA POBLANITA is a must if you feel like having home made food but don't really feel like making it! Guilty! 

The only downside to this spot would be the restroom, their restroom is in the back. But i am sure that with more clientele they will fix this in the future! 

Gracias LA POBLANITA por su deliciosa comida!"}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican food places. Everything was delicious! The staff was super friendly. Can't wait to come eat there again!"}
{"text":"This is a taco stand at an old gas station. You walk inside and tell them how many tacos you want, you pay and they give you a small post it note with your order. Then you bring the post it outside and tell the employee what you want. Food is quick and tasty and then you add your own toppings. The downfall is that the menu has about 9 different meat options but they actually only have 4 or 5."}
{"text":"This \"Poor Little Girl\" is huge on taste and easy on your wallet. I mean, 5 rolled tacos for under $4 bucks!? Come on. 
This is not a large restaurant. They have a drive through that's always busy and about 10 tables for seating. 
Very friendly family run business providing wonderful foods; all made when you order it. No microwaved ready to go stuff here.
So unless you're some wussy gringo go try it. You will find you now have another favorite to frequent."}
{"text":"This place is definitely the New Mexican favorite place. Price is very reasonable and the quality of the food; made to perfection!!! Check it out very tasty"}
{"text":"The food was fresh, authentic and absolutely amazing! The street tacos were fabulous as was the burrito bowl and shrimp tacos. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican Food!!!!

Shrimp Tacos Amazing!!!

Carne Asada Burrito Wet style is like being in Heaven while you eat"}
{"text":"Great service food was delicious as well I wii ve back soon ...small family owned business with great variety of dishes"}
{"text":"Definitely lived up to its five stars. Had a kid tournament out here and I stopped by and wasn't disappointed.  I ordered the shrimp tacos and they were fantastic! So good that I wish I lived on this side of town."}
{"text":"Me and my fiancé drove 20 minutes to eat at this restaurant. Though all the food was good, I was expecting more. I really wanted to get the Chicken Mole combo but the gentleman working there talked me out of it, saying it was very sweet. I ended up ordering the surf and turf city burrito instead. It was good, but I was all hyped up for rich and indulgent mole. He acted like their mole was overly sweet and not savory at all. None the less, I still wanted to try the sauce (because the yelp pictures looked great), so I asked for a small taste so I could maybe order it next time. Unfortunately, I was told the cook was still in the process of making the sauce so I couldn't try it... I kind of wonder maybe if he talked me out of it because it wasn't done yet. We ate there, so it just seems like he could've offered a sample when the cook finished making it. He was very nice and answered our questions about the menu, but I'm just disappointed I didn't get to see if I liked the mole. I probably would be more likely to be a returning patron if I had the opportunity. But the place is very clean and has good food. The torta we ordered was by far the best thing we ate, yummy horchata too."}
{"text":"I went in today because it use to be a Rivas n I loved that place, decided to try it out and let me just say the customer service was fantastic. I always get upset when I'm treated poorly when spending my money on food places. But be expected to be greeted with a smile and heartwarming attitude. The lady was very sweet, especially when we forgot to tell her that we didn't want guacamole in one of the burritos that she had already made. I got rolled tacos but idk they weren't crispy and the toppings weren't spread out. To be quite honest they were kind of flavorless. The street pastor taco I got was alright. My mom did enjoy her nachos though. :) I would go again to try other things on the menu. Customer service is always a win for me."}
{"text":"Exactly what Coraopolis needs!  Its friendly, cheap, fast and most importantly  delicious."}
{"text":"OMG!! This little place was excellent.  It was easily the best Mexican restaurant we have been to in Phoenix.  I had the Chicken Mole plate which included rice, beans and tortillas.  The chicken was cooked perfectly.  The mole was so good, I could have licked my plate except there were other customers.  My husband had the fish tacos, which were great.  They tasted \"made to order\".  I have been to other Mexican restaurants where the fish tacos tasted like thawed fish sticks.  We also had the shrimp tacos, which were perfect.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Not gonna lie, found out about this place from a recommendation from someone at the Pittsburgh Taco Festival. THIS PLACE is the REAL DEAL! Got some great Mexican salsa that I usually have to order from Texas, too! Ordered ribeye, beef & chicken tacos! Go were great but, in my opinion, the ribeye was FANTASTIC! Not just fantastic for Pittsburgh but it's right up there with some of Austin/San Antonio's best! I realize that my pallet is different from the typical Pittsburgher, but if you want something closer to authentic (no cheese & sour cream) tacos, THIS THE PLACE!"}
{"text":"Gracias!  Great food. My boys love the pollo and al pastor with pineapple tacos. I had cheese quesadillas (vegetarian) and added toppings.  Delicioso!"}
{"text":"Place was exactly what you want! Awesome simple quality tocos! I ate 10. 8 pastor 2 asada. Meat cooked perfect. Very juicy not greasy! Also went with a churro to top it off! Can't wait to come back next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing tacos and plenty of new things to try in the grocery store.  They even have a butcher counter where you can get the meat they serve on their tacos to try at home!  All kinds of Mexican candies and sodas too.  They also have homemade bread on certain days.
Warning: I love spicy food but their hot salsa is no joke!"}
{"text":"Wanted something to eat and searched yelp for recommendations in the area. This was the best choice!!! Everything we had was amazing. Shrimp tacos are a must!"}
{"text":"Do you get That hungry feeling between lunch and dinner where you are hungry enough to eat a full meal but spouse is expecting you to go out with the in-laws for dinner?

La Poblanita taco stand is the answer for that! Their Tacos are really satisfying and their salsa bar is fresh!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent!  Had the mole enchiladas as well as green enchiladas... My husband had the carne asada sope.  Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"The place is really clean, the food is amazing and affordable. Try the churros, si yummy. Also the presentation of the dishes is really good"}
{"text":"Been driving past this place for a few months and finally decide to stop in today. I got 4 tacos (all beef) and that was it. Pay inside first then bring sticky note to cook ($10 minimum on charge cards). The Mexican Grocery store inside has a bunch of stuff you won't see in any normal grocery store around the city.

Kid on the grill said to give him a few minutes but I was in no rush. Two minutes later I got my tacos. I put the mild sauce on two. Mild sauce had nice flavor and was not spicy at all. I'm a fan of spice so put the hot sauce on the other two. That's legit hot. Sweating hot but really good.

Overall really glad I stopped. There was some fat/gristle in the ground beef but it was still tasty. Will be back soon to try other meats."}
{"text":"This tiny gem sits back a bit from 75th Avenue. Well worth finding. The staff is friendly and helpful. They speak English too. Everything that I have tried from here has been very delicious. The tacos de carne asada are fantastic. They don't skimp on anything. I've also found a favorite item on the menu, thanks to the recommendation from the owner. The Kung Fu dragon bowls are in shrimp or carne asada. They have plenty of meat of your choice and organic vegetables. Very fulfilling and delicious. I highly recommend that you find this place and give it a try. You will not be disappointed. Try it!!!"}
{"text":"Little open air grill with good food. I sat with some real Mexican hombres who didn't know I speak a little Spanish. It was good fun to ask them a couple of quick questions in Spanish after they discussed me and my motorcycle in Spanish. Good fun, they blushed and we all laughed. Tacos $2.90 and quesadillas $4.00. Chicken, Beef, Mexican sausage, pork, pork and pineapple, and steak. Tasty, quick, reasonable, and fun. When you arrive, the menu and prices are on the grill, but you pay inside the store. Grab a real Mexican Coca Cola made with cane sugar like days of yore. Delicious, and brush up on your Spanish,"}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie I'm a little disappointed. The rice had no flavor and the beans were not any better. To quote my roommate who ate the burrito \"it taste like they left  this burrito out for a few days and then reheated it in the microwave. The #12 (minus the beans and rice) was pretty tasty though! 
Overall...I probably  wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"When walking or driving by the place, you wouldn't think it's anything special. It's a small hole in the wall mexican place that takes your order at the cashier. The cashier was super friendly and offered to let us try the mole sauce as well as the horchata before ordering. Everything on the menu is homemade and from my experience with the shrimp burrito it was delicious! They have a salsa bar where you can get more salsa and they also have a pretty spicy habenero salsa. I came with family and each person enjoyed their meal the prices are so reasonable and the food was fresh and flavorful. The flavors complimented each other well and the salsas added a tangy, spicy and savory mix. The tortillas here are nicely soft and chewy and when fried in the tostadas it offers a great crunch. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Food was good. Just ate Dinner with my wife! I got Poblanita and my wife got Asada plate. We both enjoyed our meals. Service was very nice. Place was clean. Menu had a lot of options to choose from. Would recommend it if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Fantastic, little grill!  Both the shrimp tacos and burritos were excellent.  The vegetarian burrito,also, had just the right mix of flavors and textures.  Extra sauces bar had a variety of delicious options.  Service was prompt and friendly.  We are from Detroit area, Las Vegas, and Seattle and all agree this is one of the best Mexican (&Salvadoran?) grills we've patronized."}
{"text":"Do not come here tryna get Taco Bell! This is the real deal bomb azz authentic Mexican food. I got two tacos for $5 and ate them before I could get a pic. Stop by here for tacos you won't regret it! You have to ask for cheese/ sour cream though!"}
{"text":"I went at like 7pm, when it was dark out and felt safe walking in, even though it is a sketchy area. They also have a drive through if you don't want to walk in. 

I got the Carne Asada Tacos and the Green Chili Beef tacos for my husband and I to share. Plus one of those BOMB Churros.  

Now 9 times out of 10, I prefer Carne Asada, and 9 times out of 10, I hate Churros.  The Asada was good, but the Green Chili Beef was AMAZING. Plus, I cannot EVER imagine going back to this place without getting a Churro. The cream in the middle is EVERYTHING. 

If I'm ever in the area again, I will for sure be back."}
{"text":"This place has something different. The place is super clean and the tácitos are the best I've had in a long while. It's what hipster tacos aspired to be. The focus is on the food no gimmicks, wish I could buy the place."}
{"text":"Had the two burrito combo which was asada and la pastor. Excellent flavor in the meat and the tortillas were fresh. Wife had the street tacos which she liked.

It's a great place to get some quick food with great flavor"}
{"text":"Best authentic tacos in the pittsburgh area. Very reasonably priced. Use the hot sauce work caution."}
{"text":"Lo que puedo desir que fue una grata experiensia comente una autentica cemita poblana.. se de comida. Y mis respetos para este lugar lo recomiendo..."}
{"text":"Simple but authentic and delicious. The horchata is incredible and the tacos do not disappoint."}
{"text":"I'm so happy this place is close to home. I looooove the chicken tacos. They are the best tacos around. This place is always busy. I cant wait until they open in The mall at robinson!"}
{"text":"I discovered this place on Yelp. Read the good reviews, so decided to try it. It seems to be a family owned and run restraunt. Food is great,  very clean. Only complaint I have is food isn't brought out all at once. Half our table had food while the other half waited."}
{"text":"Amazing Tacos here , don't leave without trying a churro ! Well worth it . Definitely my new taco spot ."}
{"text":"Authentic, authentic, authentic! Tried 5 tacos with all different meats.... amazing. Tried the shrimp kung fu dragon...delicious. Tried the churros...yummy and the horchata was part of the party, this horchata is what I would find in Mexico."}
{"text":"They are not messing around here this food is serious, 5 tacos and a churro had me feeling some type of way"}
{"text":"Top 5 shrimp tacos of my life.  Perfect mixture of beans, shrimp, fixings, and heat.  The service was unbelievably KIND.  The woman who served me kept making sure that I had absolutely everything I needed.  I need to go back here as soon as I am in the area.  THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"Wow, did you say a 1pound burrito?! Yes, please! Burrito was my fave. With green chile beef Spicy but, so good! Sopes and the tacos are delicious as well. Oh and don't forget to get the Churros filled with cajeta! Yums!"}
{"text":"Server was sweet and very helpful. Ordered the mole which arrived in just a short 10 minutes bit noticed the cheese that topped the beans did not melt, yes, they were ice cold. My server brought me a bowl of microwaved hot beans with an apology. The mole sauce was tasty as was the rice but a second strike for cold, dry chicken that was also very small. For over $13 I would expect more although the other reviews might make me need to give a second try hoping this was just a bad day."}
{"text":"This is the second five-star Yelp review I've given this week. The reason why is I only go to places that have high Yelp reviews. I had the carne asada burrito and my wife had the carne asada tacos. They do have some of the best carne asada in town. My wife said she could eat here every day. The food is very fresh and delicious and the staff is very friendly. I live all the way in Buckeye Arizona and I will be back."}
{"text":"This is literally the best drive-thru food I have ever had. And even if we aren't rating it as such, it is still one of the top spots for Mexican food in the valley. Why? Because Poblanita delivers high-quality dishes with *real* ingredients at fair prices. 

Maybe it was the perfectly grilled carne asada that won me over first. 

Or maybe the superb al pastor, complete with chunks of sweet onion and pineapple to make it perfect. 

It even could have been the aguas frescas, which they take pride in. I love how they emphasized my need to stir my horchata, because it's made from scratch, not mix. It's the little things that make a huge difference. 

You cannot go wrong ordering anything from here. It is worth going out of your way for. What a hidden gem, so much so I almost regret telling Yelp about it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this place before going to a show at Ak-Chin Pavilion, based on the few excellent Yelp reviews.  We are so glad we did, this place is GREAT!!  Excellent service, fresh food and very clean.  

I got three small taco's, and there could have been a little more meat, but very tasty.  My husband got a spicy chipotle chicken leg with beans and rice, and it was delicious.  You could tell it was simmering all day, the meat feel right off the bone.  And the sauce was perfectly spicy.

We also got sopos, which were very good.  Again, the ingredients were all very fresh and everything was made to order.  We ate inside and they serve on real dishes, as opposed to paper or plastic, which I especially liked.

I would recommend this place to every one going to the area.  Well worth it, and very well priced."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try because of the reviews. I was disappointed.  The food is average. It was very clean which is nice."}
{"text":"Came from Colorado and tried here because of the reviews. Awesome. We ate here three nights in a row. Loved it each night. Street tacos and green chili burritos are my favorites!"}
{"text":"Another good Taco Stand connected to a little Mexican grocery.  The tacos were very good.  Had the chorizo and the al pastor.  Both very flavorful.  The toppings bar has cilantro, onion, peppers,  a tomato onion mix, a medium green salsa and a hot red salsa.  All of $2.50 each, pay inside before you order.  There are a few other types including chicken, carnitas and one or two more.  
There are a couple of picnic tables for eating or you can take it with you."}
{"text":"Very good food! Clean place and great customer service. The street tacos were super good. On the smaller side so I would recommend getting a couple. We got five tacos and a drink for only $10 and went back for more after we finished the tacos. Definitely a hole in the wall place if that's what you're looking for!!"}
{"text":"Been twice now and have tried four of the tacos:  carnitas, ribeye, chorizo, and al pastor.

All are great and we will continue to go there.

Nice staff as well.

Bonus:  there is a soft serve ice cream joint across the street so you can have a cone after your tacos."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp since I am never in this area typically. Will look for a reason to come back soon! The Cemita  Asada was very good. Kinda like a Torta."}
{"text":"A pretty good drive thru Mexican spot. The shrimp and carne asada quesadilla is my favorite thing here. The tacos are very small so make sure you buy more than two."}
{"text":"Had 7 assorted tacos and they were all delicious!!!!  Lots of very flavorful meat.  No need for any extra sauce.  Came topped with chopped onions, cilantro, and shredded red cabbage with lime on the side.  The little tortillas were toasted perfectly so they were crispy around the edges.  Plated beautiful like a fancy restaurant but super cheap! 

We were just passing through Phoenix.  If I lived here, I would definitely be a regular.  
Very clean inside and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Food: 5 stars
Value: 4 stars
Service: 3.5 stars
Dine-in atmosphere: 2 stars

In terms of fast food, this place stacks near the top. Fresh, tasty, well balanced food coming from the kitchen. It's a smidge more expensive than some other joints but the quality is there and I felt I got what I paid for. Dining in, the service is a bit slower than drive through which makes sense but when you're hungry and waiting it can be a bit frustrating. The salsa bar is solid but was missing some serving spoons, so patrons had to use their own cutlery to scoop out a couple of the salsas which isn't the most sanitary. The bathroom is also only accessible by going outside. It's to be expected at a place like this so just know what you're in for, and enjoy some bomb ass food. You're not there for white tablecloths."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here. We had the enchiladas and the asada plate , very good , lots of food. The staff is very nice!!"}
{"text":"Ill cut to the chase... portions are smaller than what you normally might get and prices are  just a teeny tiny bit higher than what id expect for hole in the wall mexican.

That being said the customer service was excellent and the food is AMAZING!!!! I had the mole and the sauce was spot on!  My girls chimichanga was also very very good!! My son had the chicken nuggets and they were tasty too. The restaurant was squeaky clean and everything tasted and seemed to be fresh and homemade... oh yeah the chips and salsa are not free but sooooo worth the couple bucks they charge....the chips literally came right out the fryer and onto the table This place is a gem!! Going back for sure!!! The food, cleanliness,  and awesome customer service, make this 5 stars all the way!!!"}
{"text":"Omg! Can't get over this place love them !!! Los amo lol... good good food !!! So clean ! So attentive ! The presentation is so pretty ! No matter what me and my boyfriend order we always love it ! We go here at least once a Week ! Tacos,tortas,sopes, churros all good !!! Give them a chance .. I did read a couple of reviews on price ! I have no idea why they are complaining ! I will pay for clean! And good food anytime !"}
{"text":"This was a delightful surprise.  Their tacos are very good and very reasonably prices.  Plus their grocery store has some very unique items.  The only minor complaint I had was the lack of seating.  However it was busy when we were there which is a good sign, but I had to go back into my vehicle to eat my food.  We will be going back."}
{"text":"Excellent!! I love it all!! Amazing service quick, fast , fresh! Even free bread and free churros served to our table! I'm totally coming back again!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Perfect spot to stop for some fantastic street tacos & burritos before a concert at Ak-Chin! A definite must."}
{"text":"We stopped by for lunch and they had delicious and well priced tacos. Each taco cost $2.50.  They also had quesadillas but we didn't try that. I had the chicken fajita, steak and pork + pineapple tacos. The chicken was my favorite.  All of the seating is outdoors and there wasn't much when we went so we took it to go.  You order inside the store and then wait outside to get your food. There is a stand with several kinds of salsa as well as guacamole, limes, cilantro, onions and peppers. I would recommend using liberal amounts of the salsas and guacamole as they were very flavorful. It is a great addition to the Coraopolis area."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try and happy i did. Breakfast burrito was a good size. I have been looking for a breakfast burrito spot . I found it!!! I also got carne asada tacos on point. Will be back soon."}
