{"text":"We're from Buffalo so we can vouch for good Wings & Beef on Weck. Take my word, Crossroads is doing it right!! No need to drive to Buffalo anymore."}
{"text":"Crossroads is always our to-go place for wings in Indian Trail! Every wing sauce is great,  but we especially like the Carolina wings. Every time we order take out, it's ready and hot within 20 minutes. The sandwiches are good too!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite go to place for burgers, wings and Friday night fish fries! The food is excellent, the service very friendly and prices are very reasonable. Highly recommend for delicious foods and alcoholic beverages"}
{"text":"Love this place. Me and my family have been coming here for years to get their authentic beef on wick sandwiches and delicious wings. The staff is always friendly and make you feel at home. Good and affordable food at a local neighborhood joint . Can't beat it!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have lived in Charlotte for over 30 years. As transplanted Western New Yorkers, we have seriously missed two favorites from our former home:  beef on weck and haddock fish fry. No longer a problem!  Both entrees were prepared deliciously as we remember them!  This time we ordered our food to go. Next time, we're dining in. The place looks great!"}
{"text":"Nope, never again. Hadn't been here in a long time, but thought we'd give it a shot. Wrong decision.  Had the wings...no taste, sauce was lacking flavor. This is the kind of place that charges you extra for blue cheese or ranch if you ask for both. That's so tacky!! Wife had the haddock which she said was decent. Service from older red headed lady was bad. We were an inconvenience to her. Checked on us once, then the check. If you hate it that bad sister, go on to the house!! Disappointed and will not return!!"}
{"text":"Driving thru, googled 'best wings' and they were right! Owner and staff super nice; owner from Buffalo and they have Beef on Weck :-)... also great beer on tap."}
{"text":"First time here,was pleasantly surprised. Was immediately seated waitresses explained everything for us. We order wings and burgers.very good and hot food.drinks were kept topped  off.will definitely be back. My new go to place for wings."}
{"text":"Oh how I have missed these wings.  Was a frequent patron of Township Grille for close to 20 years.  After recently finding out that Crossroads has the same owner I went and was not disappointed.  The wings and beef on weck are great.  Can't vouch for the other menu items but so glad to have the wings back in my life."}
{"text":"It's okay. Nothing tastes fresh or homemade or original. They make something called a weck or something like that... the bun is supposed to have kosher salt on it. This place just puts regular table salt. I don't know... they don't really seem to care about their food that much."}
{"text":"Found it recently that this was a bar that was owned by somebody from Buffalo New York. Being a former Buffaloian  I want to check out their beef on Weck and wings. I had the beef on weck and my wife had the fish fry. Both of them were actually very good. The prices are more than reasonable. I would've gave it four stars however the service was satisfactory (slow and forgot simple items).  We will go back there because the atmosphere was quiet and welcoming."}
{"text":"I cannot tell you how much we love their wings! This is the only place we go to get them now. Fried pickles are great too! Wish I could comment on the other food but we never get anything else."}
{"text":"Thanks to reading Yelp reviews I found our new local wing place. Used to frequent Township Grill years ago and thrilled to learn that the owners resurfaced at Crossroads. We've had the regular buffalo and Carolina wings. Carolina is my go-to for a little added sweetness. Calling in takeout orders is super easy with the friendly staff."}
{"text":"Just went to this place for the first time. The food is great and so it the service. Get the wings or beef on weck. Salads are also very good."}
{"text":"Nice cozy grill. ShrimpPoBoy was delicious, shrimp falling off the bun. Great service. Quiet atmosphere. Small well stocked bar. Will be back."}
{"text":"Service is abysmal (no exaggeration). Wings are great but unfortunately not worth the wait. Over 2 hours from start to finish for wings. I could have driven to East Coast Wings in Kannapolis, ate and drove home in the same amount of time with WAY less frustration.  This place could be so good but in the end it is just not.  Maybe we will try again next year."}
{"text":"Being a Buffaloian, I know what a wing should taste like and this place is the place to go for a true Buffalo wing! The Haddock dinner/fish fry is to die for and with homemade tartar sauce. Prices are reasonable and great service.The owner is from Buffalo...so he knows what he is doing!"}
{"text":"Friendly waitress with great food. Hubby loved the wings and my burger was good. The fries were tasty and they have tasty homemade ranch dressing!"}
{"text":"We had lunch from here the other day. Food was great and fresh! Service friendly with a smile."}
{"text":"Great wings!  Casual atmosphere but the chef can cook.  Sandwiches are really good here too!"}
{"text":"First time visit and will definitely be back. The wait staff was super nice, buffalo wings were fantastic and my fianc√© loved the fish fry platter. Their fries were seriously good too...not your typical fries. They were breaded with a flaky batter or something...definitely give them a try!"}
{"text":"Wings and fries are delicious but the service is pretty slow there.  Not much personality from the services unless your a regular.  they also need to get rid of their extra charge for ranch and blue cheese for the wings, or at least give a larger cup of it.  We will still eat here, its good."}
{"text":"Service is horrible. Wings are tasteless. Fried pickles were so salty we couldn't eat them. Club sandwich was tasteless also. Bathroom was gross. Won't be back"}
{"text":"I thought I'd try this place for some wings since the reviews for the food were pretty good.  There were two people in the place at the bar, the female employee seated us, took our drink order & then never came back.  She stood behind the bar yapping to the two bar patrons & never brought the drinks.  

If it was a matter of interrupting the customers that's one thing, but she was the one doing all the talking.  When it was going to end, who knows?  So we got up & started to walk out & then that prompted her to perhaps pay attention, but it was too late.

So, yes the other reviews that have complained about the service or lack thereof were right on the mark.

If you are fasting or on a diet this may be your place."}
{"text":"I love this place! I usually get either the wings or the cheeseburger. Both really good. Their mozzarella sticks are amazing! You have to try them!
I have never been disappointed with the food.
I only deducted a star because of the service. Everytime we go, we always get the worst service. Every. Single. Time.  We go a lot less than we used to because the service is always horrible. It takes them forever to get to your table, forever to bring your drinks, and forever to check on you. Even when there's no one in there.
If service was better, I would give them 5stars"}
{"text":"The food is amazing but service is terrible. Our waitress never check on us but kept yelling across our table asking those next to us how they were doing. Not very pleased with the service"}
