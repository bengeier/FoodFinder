{"text":"When it comes to pizza, no one beats Como.  Their secret spaghetti sauce recipe makes their \"Como Special\" pizza unbeatable. While the menu features a wide variety of meals, I strongly suggest trying out their pizza-ghetti.  The staff has been around forever and provides a very friendly service.  Their Delson location offers big round tables perfect for larger groups but make reservations, the place is packed day in & day out."}
{"text":"Excellente pizza, surtout la spéciale Como. Pizza très grasse cependant. Les pâtes sont très bonnes aussi. A recommander pour les sorties en famille."}
{"text":"Como pizzeria is the best pizza I`ve had in Quebec. I have only been to the one in Delson and the bacon, onion and pepperoni is absolutely delicious. We usually pick up sauce and frozen lasagna to freeze and take back home. There are no refills on soft drinks, which is usual in Quebec eateries, however, there is a reason it does not get the 5th star and it is the service. The staff has always been friendly but they seem overwhelmed. It is a busy place.  Our server brought us the wrong pizza and served me water the first time without refilling. Lame.  But again, the food is great here and it is worth a taste. I`m not going to say just yet that it is the best pizza I`ve had but it is close to the top. Let me try the white sauce pizza at Woodstock`s and I`ll get back to you..."}
{"text":"Trop graisseux..."}
{"text":"Très ordinaire, service ordinaire, décoration ordinaire... Facture hors de l'ordinaire! Allez Chez Monique à côté. Vous en aurez pour votre argent."}
{"text":"Great pizza, gigantic portions, an institution.  Hint: Ask them to go lighter on the cheese :) the only thing you will miss is a couple of calories."}
{"text":"This place has good food and is great for familly. The prices are a bit pricey in my opinion. The staff is always ready to greet you with a smile."}
{"text":"I cannot get enough of this place, the food is absolutely incredible!!!  The price is right for the quality and taste. Their pizza is indescribable!!!! I love this place."}
{"text":"Como, como, como.  What can I say?  This has to be THE BEST pizza place in the greater Montreal region and better than anything you can get on the island.    What?  Don't believe me?  Try their Mexican pizza with double bacon and then see if you can disagree.  There are ridiculous amounts of cheese on their pizzas, and the grease elevates the pizza to another dimension (sounds gross, but it's so good).  This pizza has cheese, mushrooms, pepperoni, hot banana peppers, bacon, and a special sweet and spicy sauce that's to die for!  The special pizza is pretty good, too.  What makes it special is the sauce, which is meat-based and quite delicious.    Don't pass up on their poutine, either.  Go Italian poutine, or bust.  Their pastas aren't bad either (the sauce is great, and it's the same as what's on the pizza, I think), but why waste your precious stomach space with pasta, when there's such amazing pizza (and poutine, if you're sharing) to go around?"}
{"text":"Moi je fais partie de celle qui n'aime pas Como, . Mon argument principale est ...trop...Trop gras, trop de sel, trop de fromage, trop cher, trop de bruit, le service trop mauvais, mauvais langage, mauvaise humeur généralié... je suis aller souvent et j'y vais encore seulement quand j'ai pas le choix. Le stationnement est toujours plein? Il y a une raison?"}
{"text":"Great greasy pizza. I love it, the size is huge, the taste is awesome. Service is good, delivery times can vary, based of day of the week"}
{"text":"Fast delivery, decent prices, you get a lot for you dollar, but i cant recommend this pizza, way way too greasy. I don't even understand how you can like this..."}
{"text":"Can it be possible to have too much cheese?  Good pizza but way too greasy and salty for me."}
{"text":"Good breakfast, inexpensive and fast"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the south shore, anyone who lives here will say the same. There's no better pizza than Como Pizza."}
{"text":"La meilleur pizza de la région"}
{"text":"Meilleure pizza ever. Très gras produit frais, resto familial bonne rondelles d'oignon avec du miel"}
{"text":"I did it. I have shared my childhood favourite with my fellow Yelpers. I have been eating Como pizza since I was 12 years old! We heard neighbours rave about it when we moved to La Prairie so we tried it. And we never turned back!   Now, every time I go back home, I make a pit stop at Como. While I have tried many varieties of their pizza and have enjoyed them all, my personal all-time favourite is Como's mushroom and cheese pizza. 1-- because I have a weird love for mushrooms and 2-- because it tastes amazing!  Como's tomato sauce is slightly sweet and they put a nice handful of thinly sliced mushrooms under oodles of (greasy), gooey, delicious cheese. The amount of cheese that Como uses is nuts. It's like a normal restaurant's idea of double cheese x 2!!! The pizza is cooked in a wood-fire oven and the crust is floppy and chewy at the base and airy and crispy at the edges. Sooooo good! Mind you, this is not the healthiest pizza but it is the tastiest.   Everyone who I have introduced Como to loves it and my partner and his best friend are certified-Como pizza lovers!   The amazing thing is that Como has been consistently good for so many years.   Go!!!"}
{"text":"Been here so many time and they have the best pizza ever so good that it's worth the 35 minutes drive for me to get there. I usually take the vegetarian pizza, no onions but add bacon. I know it sounds weird but trust me you will love it. The only other thing I ate there are fries so I can't comments on the rest of the menu. The place is clean and the service is always great. This place is good for groups as it is very big but if you go on Friday or Saturday after 5pm be prepared to wait it gets very busy."}
{"text":"La meilleure pizza sur la rive-sud !!!   Attention elle est tres grasse, mais si vous avez la meme mentalité que mois plus cest gras, plus mon interet augmentent haha !   Sincerement, prenez le temps de commander au moins une fois à cette pizzeria ! Vous ne le regreterez pas"}
{"text":"Ahhhh... Como Pizza... Je n'habite plus la rive-sud de Montréal depuis des lunes et je cherche son équivalent sur la rive-nord mais en vain... La croûte et l'incroyable sauce donnent à cette pizza un goût unique et formidable... La succursale de Delson à su offrir un produit très semblable à l'originale de La Prairie.  Sans contredit la meilleure pizza de la rive-sud!"}
{"text":"Super bonne pizza , une de nos meilleurs sur la rive sud . Service un peu lent , beaucoup de monde. Désert excellent !  Dispendieux"}
{"text":"Best pizza and chicken wings in the area.  Very busy and there is a good reason.  Everything else is ok but not authentic Italian. Québécois Italian I would call it. But pizza is great."}
{"text":"It's 4am on a lat June day. The sky is beginning to light up over the pool where I'm paddling around after a BBQ night that has run into the wee hours.  We're hungry again. The only thing that can sate that midnight hunger is greasy pizza and greasier poutine. You don't even know, if you think Como's is greasy now, their pizza used to be so moist the cheese would actually slide off as you cut it. It was hectic, son. A braver time, for braver men.  The quality is consistent, and you're looking at a generous helping with a relatively dry crust and a great selection of fresh toppings.  And their poutine happens to be my favorite in town. A very classic, basic poutine done right without any unnecessary adulterants or accoutrements.  Simple and original."}
{"text":"The only negative to ordering from Como that I can think of is that it completely ruins other pizzas for you. Get the Special or a Mexican with extra bacon."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Montreal??? Well I can't say that. But seeing that I live right down the street, I have to say it is the best pizza in Delson. Greasy, cheesy, and yummy. BUT, what I can recommend that most people wouldn't even think of ordering is the ribs. The ribs are awesome!  Fall off the bone, the sauce is just perfectly sweet, I can taste it now! When you go on to Como's have the pizza of course but remember a side of ribs with that:)"}
{"text":"The listing must have been deleted there were several reviews for Comos Laprairie !!!! Me, my parents and extended family grew up eating Comos delicious pizza!!!! Not you're low fat thin crust, it is absolutely greasy, has an obscene amount of cheese, the toppings are to die for and the deep crust that is so delicious I could just eat the crust!!!! A piece cannot be simply picked up without making a huge mess and covering yourself with grease so fork and knife are highly recommended!!! At your own risk of you have a cholesterol problem but certainly worth the risk !!! Another MVP is the lasagna, I find their breakfast is a bit dated, typical dinner breakfast..."}
{"text":"Beat pizza in the south shore and the only better juicy pizzas in and around Montreal are Athena's in Pierrefonds and Gigi's in Pointe-Claire."}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious, the service is quick and friendly and the price is fair. The only thing I can criticize is that I find the size of the soft drinks a little small for what they charge. I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Best South Shore poutine! The cheese curds were squeaky and didn't melt all meal long. The large plate is enough for three people - even I had trouble finishing it. One star demerit because drinks (especially beer) are overpriced."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza as long as you're looking for the mom & pop greasy fatty ohhhh so yummy pizza that makes you wonder why your wife left you for some guy fom her work. Ok I've said too much. Great pizza, everything else is just ok."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Very consistent. If you like greasy mom & pop sloppy pizza overloaded with cheese and toppings this is your place on the south shore. The decor isn't exactly fresh and modern, but neither is the pizza;))"}
{"text":"By far, the best pizza in the Montreal area. I've eaten there 3 times and never had I been disappointed. Fully loaded with generous toppings and lots of cheese-they're not stingy like sone other pizza restaurants.   As for the non-pizza items on the menu: the ribs are good, the fries just OK, the desserts are fantastic, they serve Pepsi rather than Coke!  Come with a serious appetite or take whatever remains to go because the pizza is really filling.   As far as I'm concerned, the best pizza is the kind that needs to be eaten with a fork and knife-Como is that kind of pizza!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I had pizza (and hot pot) for Christmas Eve! I wasn't too excited about it until I ate a piece! Thank goodness I had one, I feel bad for the people who didn't try the pizza!  This was one of the BEST pizzas I've ever had in my life!!! Before, I find Amelios' Pizza (now called Amelia's Pizza) is the best in Montreal but Como Pizza beats it! I believe the pizza I had was the Spécial Como which contains meat sauce, ham, bacon, onions, mushrooms, pepperoni and green peppers. I normally would get the All-dressed pizza (pepperoni, bacon, mushrooms and green peppers) but adding onions and ham really makes a huge difference in the whole pizza experience!  The pizza I had was a take-out so it wasn't (really) fresh out of the oven but it was still delicious! I wasn't expecting this to be that good until I ate it, so I didn't take a picture until I had one bite.. Ooops!   One of the things that surprised me was the cheese didn't \"harden\", even though the pizza wasn't hot anymore. Usually, the cheese would become cold and hard and the texture of the cheese will change (especially since it is a takeout), but I didn't have this problem at all! The cheese was still soft and moist!   It was my first time having a pizza with so many layers! I can definitely taste the layers of cheese, ham, etc. I'm in love with this pizza despite its greasiness.     I would definitely try their poutine one day!"}
{"text":"Excellente pizza. Certain diron qu'elle est un peu grasse, mais bon, on s'en fou, elle est super bonne et elle en vaut le déplacement. Service rapide et le personnel vous traite aux petits oignons. Sinon, leur poulet est prafait ainsi que leur sous-marin. Bon appétie ;-)"}
{"text":"every south shore hockey player knows this place.   The pizza is hands down the best on the south shore..they have a *quesadilla* taste to it. I am a purest..I like the plain cheese here.   Busy but large dining room. Price is moderate..not *everyone* speaks English but they try."}
{"text":"This simply has to be the best pizza in the Montreal area. The restaurant has different items on the menu. From their amazing pizza, to hot subs, salads, pasta, and even BBQ chicken and ribs.   If you are not in the mood for pizza - go for the pasta, it's equally as good and a regular portion will fill you up for sure. Their prices are very very responsible.  A couple of great things: - Pasta dishes can be ordered 'family style'. Perfect for splitting with others. - Mondays are 2-for-1 on draft beers from 4pm until closing. - Monday is also 1.05 slice day - try one of their four pizza snacks:   PICANTE    Tomato sauce, cheese, italian sausages, hot pepper.    BRUCHETTA    Garlic, olive oil, parsley, oregano, salt, tomate pieces.    FOCCACIA    Garlic, olive oil, parsley, oregano, salt.   NATURE    Tomato sauce, cheese.  - Tuesday 2$ off: Baby Back Ribs dishes,Pasta dishes,Choice of wine (Bottle of 750 ml and more)   Also, if you are ordering out and would like your pizza cut - ask for it done beforehand.  Finally, don't think that they only do lunch & dinner. One other great secret is that Como has a great breakfast menu for everyone. Sunday mornings can be crowded."}
{"text":"Très bonne pizza .....mais...faut pas être à la diète hein! Treeeees Cochon et gras Mais bonne"}
{"text":"Good food and good service, only thing I would change are the plates.  We stopped here on the way to the ExpoRail museum with the wife and two kids. The place is easy to find and is rather large inside with multiple sections. We got delayed at the border crossing, and got to the restaurant rather late, towards the end of the lunch hour. We were seated right away in a quiet section by ourselves away from all the locals. The waitress was friendly and helped us choose from the menu, since we spoke no French.  We ordered the Como Specialty Pizza, which came out rather quickly and with lots of meat and cheese. We were hungry and we devoured the pizza. We also ordered Crème brûlée and a Ruolo Como with cinnamon and sugar (deep fried dough balls in cinnamon and sugar). The desserts were also excellent.  One thing we disliked were the plates. There are worn beyond normal - I would not eat out of these plates at home, forget serving a guest. The plates were cold and also had marinara sauce on the side - someone served pizza and forgot to wipe/wash their hands. It was fresh, so I am hoping I am right, and it is not from some soddy dishwasher :-("}
{"text":"Como is our go-to pizza when we are on the south shore. It doesn't get any better than this.  There is the right amount of ingredients, including meats, vegetables and cheese.  Go for the Spéciale Como - you won't regret it!  It is more expensive than your average pizza delivery, but the quality and the taste warrants the higher price."}
{"text":"La meilleure pizza sur la rive-sud sans aucun doute!   Plus dispendieuse que celle des pizzérias autour mais quand on a le gout d'une bonne pizza on ne se trompe jamais avec le Como!   Nous prenons toujours la sauce suicide (une sauce tomate épicée) au lieu de la sauce tomate classique, miam!   Prévoyez jusqu'à une heure pour une livraison à l'heure du souper le vendredi/samedi."}
{"text":"9 novembre 2012 Un bon vendredi après un bon cours de tango argentin. Rien de mieux qu'une bonne pizza. Le seul bon restaurant encore ouvert à 22h00. C'est décidé, une extra large spéciale Como, rien de moins. Ah !!! ça bouche un coin.  Pizza Como a toujours été à la hauteur en termes de qualité de produits et d'efficacité de service. Excellente réception, passage de commande efficace et rapide, réception du produit no.1.  C'est simple, c'est la meilleure au monde !   November 9, 2012 A great friday after a good argentinian tango class. Nothing better than a good pizza. The only place still opened at 10 pm. the choice is made, an extra large Como special, nothing less. Ah !!! that fills a spot.  Como pizza has always been on top in terms of food quality and service efficiency. Excellent greeting, fast order, food arrival no.1.  Simple, the best in the world !"}
{"text":"La pizza est EXCELLENTE (meilleure mangée sur place), le service est rapide. L'endroit est un peu bruyant (ce qui est parfait si on a des enfants!).   À noter qu'il y a une file à l'extérieur à partir de 17h le vendredi, samedi et dimanche, donc un peu d'attente! Très populaire comme endroit."}
{"text":"Simply the best. The special como is beyond delicious. Fries are homemade and not salty at all. The perfect balance, pizza is love, pizza is life."}
{"text":"Best pizza on this side of the south shore hands down. But there definitely is a difference with the pizza cooked at their Taschereau location. But you cannot go wrong  with a Como pizza with meat sauce. It's fun to see the reactions of those trying a Como pizza for the very first time."}
{"text":"Excellente pizza toute garnie!  Si possible, demandez une table servie par Mimi!  Elle a du caractère!"}
{"text":"Gooey, stretchy, best cheesiest cheese pizza you will ever have! With the perfect sauce and fluffy crust! A must stop every time I'm visiting. Thank you como for being there when ever I need a pizza, a poutine and a Stewart's root beer :)"}
{"text":"Ma premier fois chez como arrive après un show de lutte de Sorel-Tracy arrive chez como vers minuit  Beaucoup de choix dans le menu bon prix un peux cher dépendant de quoi surtout le extra pour les Pizza   J'ai pris la pizza spéciale como all-dressed bacon sauce à viande pis en dessert les boules au sirop érable   Mes amies on pris une pizza sauce suicide avec pepperoni et bacon vraiment bonne   La serveuse était Ben Gentille et souriante"}
