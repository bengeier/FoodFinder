{"text":"I bought my Nespresso last week at Macy's and the following day went to the Nespresso store at Fashion Square mall. Yes they were busy, I waited for a few minutes and was able to talk to a clerk about different types of coffee,s available plus got to sample a coffee. Very nice store all employees seemed professional. They explained how coffee is sold in sets of 10. I appreciate getting the facts up front. No issues with this store or staff very friendly and professional."}
{"text":"Really wanted to give 5 stars. Love the coffee, disappointed in the people at the Boutique. Should have known it wasn't going to an excellent customer experience when the person in front of me left after a barrage of four letter words. The \"coffee specialists\", yes both of them, didn't even bother to look up and acknowledge I was standing there until they were done discussing the previous customer and typing on the computer. Not even a \"we will be right with you.\" The kicker... got home and they didn't include a sleeve of pods, but they charged me for them anyway. No big deal right? Just call they store and let them know... problem is no local phone number. Call the number on the receipt guess what... 20+ minutes and I'm still on hold. So sad that in today's world your best customer experience is shopping online."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Nespresso and I am so excited there is an exclusive boutique now. My husband bought the Nespresso machine about 3 years back and we used to order the pods online,which was painful as you had to pay for shipping and also have to order in bulk to save some money, but I don't have to deal with that anymore, yay! I am checking out the store this weekend...oh and the coffee and flavors, they are just out of the world..love love love"}
{"text":"Just quickly stopped in to stock up. Next time you're here I recommend talking to Reed. He was great help and even steered me to a new product that I ended up buying. Great knowledge and customer service!"}
{"text":"The only way to get coffee for my Nespresso machine is to order it online or purchase at a Nespresso boutique. I have been to this place three times in the past year to purchase the specialty coffee and each time I walk away angry and disappointed at the way my wife and I are treated.

I understand this place is popular and they have a lot of customers to make free espressos for, but the condescending and patronizing attitude is something not even  the busiest coffeehouse can equal.

I am not making the trip to this place again. I will purchase my Nespresso online from now on."}
{"text":"Great customer service! Took their time to educate us on the different types of machines."}
{"text":"The people that work at this location are very knowledgable about their brand and very polite. They are also very accommodating as well. They make suggestions according to what you like. They let you try as many samples of the coffee as you choose. They give free delicious chocolates if you are a customer.  And they are yummy!! What more can I say?!"}
{"text":"Christopher welcomed my wife and me into this Nespresso store with open arms today - and we are grateful!!! We are from Dallas/FT Fort Worth, Texas (although I was born and raised in Arizona). We confessed that we could not get a decent cup of coffee at the resort where we were staying and we were in deep addictive withdrawals missing our Nespresso machine at home....Christopher hooked us up with a killer cup of Nespresso while we chatted about early life in Scottsdale and about the Carey Business School at ASU and life in general. It was just an awesome time in space with no-pressure conversation between loyal customers and an extremely professional Nespresso Sales Associate. This is a big reason why Nespresso has been such a huge success! Thank you Christopher!!!"}
{"text":"When Nespresso moved from Sur La Table at Kierland Commons to Scottsdale Fashion Square, they did not inform their customers, whom they maintain a database on. I wasted a trip from Tempe intending to get coffee. Now, they have closed the store in the Macy's wing in anticipation of opening the new one in the Nordstrom's wing, and again did not inform their customers. This is the only place in all of Phoenix to buy Nespresso -- wonderful coffee, lousy customer service!"}
{"text":"** THIS IS FOR THE NEW NESPRESSO BOUTIQUE AT FASHION SQUARE ** We happened to be walking by the new Scottsdale Fashion Square Nespresso Boutique - the day after Thanksgiving - and popped in. The place was packed and we were about to leave when we were kindly greeted by Amy, who despite the crowd, walked us through two of the espresso machines calmly, full of knowledge and very patiently. As we were about to leave we eyed one of your more expensive machines and asked a lady, who we later found to be Joanne, a few questions. Well, Joanne was INCREDIBLE - so full of knowledge, an incredible Nespresso Ambassador, again so patient and so kind, showing us all of the different benefits of the machine, despite being bombarded by clients all over. She made us feel very well taken care of, great service, great knowledge and a great experience for us. Joanne is exceptional and we are most grateful for her help! We ended up buying the bigger machine and the starter coffee set, and the reason for this was Joanne. She gave us the confidence we needed in Nespresso to spend this kind of money on coffee. Nespresso is fortunate to have her as one of their employees."}
{"text":"Hey Yelp nation, hands down this is the best product on the market. This boutique store provides a purchasing experience that I've never known. Our representative Lisa was flat out an amazing ambassador for Nespresso. I felt like we were buying a luxury watch or a High end sports car. Lisa provided a demonstration of several machines and provided samples of the delicious coffee each one made. We landed on the model that provided smooth espresso, latte and cappuccinos. We loved the bright red color. Lisa then arranged for us to have a club account, she explained the recycling program and shipped our machine and coffee pods (sleeves)to our home free. Finally, when we complicated Lisa's professionalism, she shared how impressed she is with Nestle Corporation and told us they were a great company to work for. Knowing that Nestle is a first rate employer mattered to us and it made our purchase even sweeter (forgive the pun). Too bad the state I live in doesn't have a Nespresso Boutique but I'm really glad Scottsdale has one!"}
{"text":"I love the staff here. Everybody is so pleasant and even though he line is always long here, I don't think I've ever had to wait more than 5 minutes for somebody to get me checked out and on my way. I love that you can try the new seasonal flavors before you buy. Very convenient too since you get your capsules right away. I do recommend purchasing sleeves when there is promos and buy in bulk to save some money."}
{"text":"Excellent service, comme toujours. 

Nespresso tient à conserver son image de marque et le fait avec Brio. Les employés sont polis et vouvoient tous ceux qui s'aventurent dans le magasin. On vous sert une tasse du ''grand cru'' de votre choix et on vous laisse le loisir de magasiner sans vous importuner. J'adore aller là, on se sent comme un roi !"}
{"text":"Only one person at the register on a Saturday, 16 people in line and 3 other employees making mini coffees. How about moving 2 people of the people making mini coffees to the register and taking care of the people trying to purchase something from you and not scam a free mini coffee off of you? Been in line for over 20 min and not one person has moved a foot. Meaning the clown at the front register has zero clue on helping people purchase and moving the line. I get you are all about the notes of coffee but on a Saturday? Poor management. Recruit. Ever since you moved to this location it has been this way."}
{"text":"Yesterday, I was in the Nespresso Boutique at Scottsdale Fashion and purchased 5 sleeves of coffee. I was assisted by Andrew who was very professional, quick, and extremely pleasant. I later left my bag of coffee in the Nordstrom's restroom and when I went back to retrieve it, someone had taken it. No one turned it in to Nordstrom's, so I went back to Nespresso to see if anyone dropped it off. Unfortunately, no one had. When I decided to buy more coffee, Andrew actually displayed unbelievable customer service and replaced my five sleeves without charging me. Losing the purchased coffee was TOTALLY my fault and I was really taken aback and surprised that Andrew gave me replacement coffee. Today customer service is almost nonexistent and I didn't expect this at all. Andrew, you made my day and because of your service, Nespresso has a customer for life! If management or corporate looks at these reviews, please pass on to Andrew that he represented your company in a way that exceeds all customer expectation and it was so very much appreciated. Andrew... seriously...you made my day! THANKS!"}
{"text":"Not personable service yesterday. We bought six sleeves for the Nespresso. The person helping us didn't engage us. He barely provided us with information about the coffee favors. He actually never even said hello to us.  Next time I need Nespresso  cups, I will buy them online."}
{"text":"N'espresso has crossed over to the other side with darker roasts. Yum!"}
{"text":"wonderful selection prices the same as online store with no shipping fees.Clean store and your able to taste test different flavors."}
{"text":"I've been researching single use coffee machines for a while now. 

I first tried Keurig and their K-Cups, which initially Starbucks supported and then decided to compete against with their own machine. Flying under the radar for the most part was Nestle's Nespresso brand.

About a year or so ago, Nestle's revamped their system and rolled out the EvoluoLine. Their previous capsules were gradually superseded with these half moon containers (see photo), though they still sell the originals. 

And violà, enter George Clooney and Danny DeVito in their TV commercial and Hollywood sendup: \"Is that Cough-Fee?  I want in.\"  Who else could play Napoleon, but DeVito, right?

All of which, that leads me to this store yesterday. I've been taste-testing, and really didn't like the other two choices (K-Cups or Starbucks). I've been comparison shopping for a while and Macy's had the least expensive machines prior to Black Friday. 

But when Macy's website crashed and failed to refresh on Black Friday, I bought my Nespresso on Amazon. 

It was delivered yesterday morning at 8 am. Yes, Amazon delivers on Sunday.  And yes, the machine's \"Cough-Fee\" was delicious. 

This store is the only free standing location that I am aware of. I'm sure there are others, or you can go to the Sur la Table store but their prices are much, much higher. So I would skip them. 

This Nespresso store located in Scottsdale Fashion Square, which sells both Kitchen Aid and Nestle's brand Nespresso machines. Nice!

Here you can taste, and try their entire range of both plain & flavored coffee/ espressos.   So come, taste, and ask questions, as I did. They are very friendly and helpful. 

When UR ready to buy a box of ten capsules, know that they are priced at $11 each. The same as on the internet BTW, go figure. So about $1.10 for a delicious cup of coffee. That works for me. 

I would also recommend buying the milk steamer/frother. Nespresso makes a distinctive, strong tasting cup of coffee, but not heavily caffeinated. In France, most tend to drink their coffee, Café au lait style; or 2/3 coffee and 1/3 milk, which I believe tastes the best. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Hi. My name is Kimberly and I am a coffee junkie. I am 100% addicted and I don't want help for my problem. I am fine with it. I don't care to detox from this caffeine obsession. Just let me have it and all will be okay with all in my world. When I run out of Nespresso pods, those are very bad days and then we all may have a problem. Usually there is a lead up time about a week prior when I notice the depletion starting. Those are the days when I look in the Nespresso pod holder and say sleepily , 'Yeah, yeah.. I need to login to Nespresso and order a few sleeves... I'll do that when my coffee kicks in.' Then I forget. Thanks to Yelp, of course, I learned of this Nespresso Boutique! Problems of procrastination of caffeine addiction ordering solved! This is the only boutique in all of Arizona and one of few in the US. I have a career that takes me abroad often and I have been able
to pop into Nespresso in Paris or Madrid and grab my sleeves of Nespresso when I am there, but that's not always convenient...!? Now is it?!! I walked into my small heaven when I saw this wall of all my lovely colorful Nespresso pods lined up neatly in lovely little rows along the wall inside Sur la Table at Keirland Commons. They even carry the limited flavors that run out pretty quickly online. Like the Chocolate Cafe that was over the holiday season. They have all the current Nespresso machines and accessories like the perfection frothing aeroccino. They will even make you a small, NOT sampler, BUT legit CUP of Nespresso espresso to your liking complete with lid. There is a queue and was a line that went pretty swiftly. The staff is knowledgable and friendly. My info was in the system and yours will be too after your first purchase or if you have ordered before. I am excited that all I have to do is drive , park, walk in and buy... oh and I can drop my used pods off for recycling and get my fresh recycling Nespresso bags here too... AAANNNDD!! I get more caffeine to sip while buying yet more caffeine to take home for my needs ! No shaking in waiting ... just coffee before talky!"}
{"text":"Après 6 bons mois de rénovation ils ont ouverts avec une façade franchement impressionnante! C'est luxuriant, le service a la clientèle est vraiment pas mal et le café est bon! Encore plus cool! Tu peut essayer et emmener avec toi gratuitement!"}
{"text":"We went today to buy our coffee. We have had a Nespresso coffee maker since 2010. We have had a number of different models but always the small pod. Today we decided to ask about the larger pod. When we got to the store there was a young man at the tasting station ( hair dyed blond )and as we saw no one else on the floor at that time we asked him what the difference in intensity would be between the small pod and the large pod coffee maker. He was a bit smug answering our questions and made us feel like he neither wanted to serve us, and that we were very, shall I say, not savy regarding Nespresso. Of course we needed information, that is his job or at least I think that would be his job. Anyway we were so disappointed in his demeanor that we left without buying a new machine. Will return as this is the only Nespresso Boutique in the area and because we love the coffee."}
{"text":"Great place. Totally addicted to Nespresso. The staff is very helpful, and you'll like the free tasting."}
{"text":"Was in your Scottsdale Arizona location and your employee there Andrew seems to have a problem with me. I don't really know why. I'm a gay male who frequently shops here for myself and my husband. Twice now I have been to this location and he's made it a point to gossip with other employees about my presence in the store. Today was my second time in and he was completely rude when entering the store and ran to the back to talk about me with another employee. The lack of professionalism is typically what I see when it comes to this gentleman. Bad bad bad. When it comes to the general public I pretty much ignore this kind of petty behavior but I live and work in this community and I feel like he's a poor example representing you."}
{"text":"This store is a gem and every employee I've interacted with since it first opened has been nothing but kind and helpful.  I have been to the store about 8 times since it opened.  The store is always busy and there is a wait, however, once it's your turn the employees take time to make sure you are taken care of. It saddens me to see a review that was I in-complimentary of Andrew.  Andrew is a bright and shining star.  He is exemplary in every way, always making sure myself and other customers are taken care of. I have never seen him act rude to anyone.  Also the other reviewer said that Andrew goes in the back and gossips about him, that's rubbish. First the store is so busy I've never seen more than one employee in the back at a time and then only for mere moments to get something. Second how would the reviewer no Andrew was gossiping about him as customers aren't allowed in the back. I hope the Nespresso company takes the other review about Andrew with a grain of salt. Nespresso is lucky to have him and the rest of the staff at this store!!!"}
{"text":"Great experience! Andrew was extremely helpful and we are very happy to purchase our second Nespresso machine! Highly recommend Andre in assisting you in your next purchase!"}
{"text":"C'est comme de la magie. 
Tellement de possibilités, tellement un bon marketing, du café de qualité qui goûte bon (incroyable pour du café en capsules), c'est super attrayant, beau, délicieux.

Dégustations gratuites. Vous choisissez votre café, on le prépare et on vous invite à passer au \"bar à dégustations\". Tellement classe! On s'y accote avec sa petite tasse et on a l'air de la famille Kennedy, mais sans les tragédies *autrement dit, on a l'air riche et célèbre, et c'est ainsi qu'on se sent*. On nous sert un p'tit chocolat en accompagnement, et ça, c'est excitant. 

Vous avez une/des machines Nespresso à la maison? Amenez plusieurs billets verts, vous aurez le goût d'investir dans des accessoires pour les capsules, les machines, de nouvelles tasses, de petits présentoirs, de nouvelles variétés de capsules... La tentation est grande. 

Une petite étoile en moins pour la dame qui m'a servi mon café, qui m'a rappelé d'un ton qui frisait l'arrogance que les capsules Nespresso ne fonctionnent pas dans les machines traditionnelles, juste parce que je voulais goûter une nouvelle variété de café même si je n'ai pas de machine à la maison. Désolée madame!

Les autres employé.es étaient tout sourire malgré la journée sans doute épuisante qu'ils et elles venaient de passer (il y avait, le temps d'une journée, un rabais impressionnant sur une machine dans un autre magasin qui dirigeait les clients vers la Boutique après leur achat). Chapeau! J'y retournerai, avec ou sans machine, pour moi ou pour un cadeau à un être cher!"}
{"text":"We are absolutely in love with our Nespresso machine.  Before we bought that machine, I never knew you could make such amazing coffee at home.  I usually make a double shot latte with one Carmelito and one Rosabaya with my steamed milk.  The fancy new digs of the store in Scottsdale are very nice.  They finally made that store match the high-class look of most of the other stores in the country/world.  The employees are always willing to make you a cup of coffee if you'd like to try a new flavor.  Look for their 25% off sales twice a year.  It'll save you a bundle on those $400+ machines."}
{"text":"It's pretty inconvenient for us to drive all the way from Tempe. But the last time we ordered sleeves through the mail the majority of them were damaged. 

Making the commute is always worth the drive. The staff here are always very tentative and nice. They know their stuff and we always seem to have something to talk about when it comes to coffee. Also, they always have tips on how to create different beverages with your specific Nespresso machine. 

When sampling drinks they always seem very knowledgeable about the tastes and what a customer seeks in relation to their coffee preference. I mean what coffee company lets you try their espresso/coffee before purchasing?"}
{"text":"It was our first time needing to buy pods since we bought our Nespresso Vertuoline & the experience was great. Tucked inside the Sur La Table at Kierland, the Nespresso *bar* has very helpful employees plus you get to enjoy a free cup of coffee while you're there. We bought a few new packs of pods & an employee registered our machine & we got a little keychain for easy check in next time. We will definitely come back to the store when we need to order again rather then order online."}
{"text":"I received my very first Nespresso espresso machine as a birthday gift a few months ago, and I just ordered my SECOND machine so I can have one when I travel. Yes, folks, Nespresso is THAT addictive and delicious! 

The downside to owning a Nespresso maker is that you must use their proprietary coffee pods, which cost anywhere from .50 - .75 each (ouch)! They have an online mail order site, but you have to pay shipping fees on top of everything else -- so imagine my excitement when I took a trip to the Scottsdale area and found a nifty little Nespresso boutique where I could purchase the pods in person with no shipping!

Basically the boutique is a small section of the swanky Sur La Table store in the Kierland Commons shopping area of Scottsdale. The Nespresso section is on the left side of the store and is easy to spot. The boutique sells all of the pods for all Nespresso machines, including the special holiday roasts and other limited edition flavors. 

The BEST THING about the boutique is that the employees will make you as many coffees as you want; I probably sampled 8 or 9 different espresso blends that day (see my photo). It's a great way to compare the pods and see which roasts you really love. I dropped over $200 on specialty pods on my last visit. They also have a pod recycling bin so you can save up your used pods and bring 'em in to help save the planet. The boutique of course sells all the latest Nespresso machines and accessories.

Worth noting is that the Nespresso boutique, while physically located inside the store, is separate from Sur La Table so you CANNOT use a Sur La Table gift card for any purchases there."}
{"text":"It was a madhouse on Black Friday, but as always the staff was both friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"So happy to see the second and closer opening of Nespresso in Carrefour Laval across from the garden area (across from Zara).  Today I didn't dare go into the boutique as there was a crowd controller and massive lineup that snaked around the corner.  I did stop for some photos!  I will update the review after my first official visit.  As per Nespresso the boutique is nothing short of class, elegance and clean design!  Peering in however,  it is much smaller than the version on Crescent with a massive wall of pod sleeves on the left!  I welcome this location as it will allow me to avoid traffic and time all the way downtown especially on those cold winter days!"}
{"text":"Longtime Nespresso user.  Nice shop, good product, but don't ever try to phone them to ask a question.  The phone is never answered. There is no voice mail.  Next time you're in the store watch them let the phone ring.  and ring.  We're switching to Starbucks Verismo."}
{"text":"Went to taste the new cold brew coffee wow I hope they make this something I can buy year round. Very smooth."}
{"text":"Loved the service at this store, especially loved talking to Reed. He is, by far, one of the most knowledgeable and helpful team members my husband and I have ever met at a nespresso store. I learned so much about coffee and also about Nespresso as a company. Thanks to Reed, I learned more about the amazing projects Nespresso is working on- such as sustainability. It is great to be able to talk to a team member that is so down to earth and friendly. We were able to try different espresso flavors and found one we loved! Thank you so much Reed!"}
{"text":"I am extremely disappointed that we went to this event, and they ran out of complimentary pair of riedel glasses. We were there at 2pm  not late in the day. If people RSVP'd there should have been an adequate supply on hand. We even spoke with one of the associates the day before, and they said to come whenever time was convenient. Very poorly planned event. I don't plan on attending another event if this is how they are conducted. A waste of my time."}
{"text":"I do miss the boutique at Sur La Table in Kierland as it was a lot more convenient for me. However, I believe Nespresso outgrew their space there and it was time for their own digs. While I am a huge fan of Nespresso and its coffee, I think the service and the staff could be a lot friendlier especially considering the premium prices that they charge. 

I have had the Pixie model for years and it's been extremely reliable. My absolute favorite is the Arpeggio and occasionally the Ristretto. The machines could not be any easier to use and ordering coffee online is a snap and actually easier than driving to the boutique to get my capsules. The lines at this store at least in my experience have always been long and the service in Kierland was a lot friendlier in my humble opinion."}
{"text":"I always have great service from the experts at Nespresso Boutique. Not only are they quick with a sample but know what they are selling. Also used the online version of Nespresso. Once in the Boutique I purchased some sleeves and, surprise, they gave me a $30 cube since I hadn't visited for a while. Great customer service, great coffee and great machine. They also take used capsules to recycle and have free recycle bags."}
{"text":"We used to go to the Sur la Table at Kierland for our Nespresso so we are glad that there is a Boutique closer to home.  The staff is extremely friendly and are eager to serve you.  The display is nice and everything is so clean."}
{"text":"Excellent little espresso machines. Kinda hard to find it is inside of the sur la tab"}
{"text":"All the nespresso coffees are awesome. This place specifically has a large assortment of the nespresso coffees. You can try before you buy which is pretty cool. Everyone here is very helpful and nice, love coming here to buy my coffees"}
{"text":"Outstanding customer service, trained store employees, espresso products - both machines and coffee pods, etc. I have never had a bad experience here, despite long-waits during peak shopping hours, but that is because they have an amazing array of products!!!

I will not order from amazon.com their coffee pods again, even for convenience for the price, service and experience are all top-notch at this store!"}
