{"text":"Sweet Italian place in an industrial area that serves the morning and lunch crowd.   Warning: once the food is gone is gone so go earlier than 2pm especially if yoy want their delicious veal or specials. Their tomato sauce is where the flavor is at. I don't ask for dressing with my Caesar salad because I dip it in my extra sauce. Always ask for extra sauce ;)  The meals are priced well,  under 10 bucks for a pasta and meat or even chapters for sandwiches and salad.   The ladies working there are sweet and gosh darn good cooks. They also cater so call ahead!   I wish they were open on wkds."}
{"text":"Great hidden gem!   Little italian place that serves up some amazing chicken and veal in a rockin tomato sauce. The prices are great and they even cater on the weekends! This place is packed in the mornings for breakfast and lunch. They only make a certain amount of chicken and veal so come early or order ahead!!   I've tried their pasta and it's okay... But the meat dishes are the real stars. Get extra sauce so you can dip your bread! Yum!!!!"}
{"text":"More like a 3.5* for Veal Parm sandwich, but I did bump it up for good CS.  This place is run by an older Italian couple.  I visited after 2pm, so although there was veal left, nothing else really stood out - visually.  It did look as though there were some fresh personal pizzas though, but I did not feel like pizza.  Veal sandwich was HUGE.  I was only able to eat half.  However, there wasn't a lot of sauce in my sandwich, so maybe that's something you hafta request.  Price was also cheaper than other Italian sandwich places at $5.50!  So lower-than-average prices is definitely a draw for La Parmigiana.  Interior is very dated, so ideal for grabbing a quick bite/lunch takeout.  No atmosphere, especially after you miss the lunch rush!"}
