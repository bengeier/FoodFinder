{"text":"Terrible! We ordered from them on NYE and I specifically mentioned that I had a shrimp allergy and would like to request a meal without shrimp. The girl said no problem but it would $5 extra to do so. Fine. We ordered a dinner for 5 and two of the dishes had shrimp in them! I called them to ask if they could replace the two orders with something else or simply refund me the price difference of the two orders. The girl who answered the phone said she would speak with the manager and we heard nothing back. Very frustrating to have radio silence. Anyway, never ordering from them again and will certainly tell all my friends about this experience as we live in Clarkson."}
{"text":"Service was \"OK\", not the best you would receive upon requesting no seasme oil in the dishes.  The lady just kept telling me \"Can't be done, no\".  So anyways, I still proceeded with my order.   Waiting time was approximately 15 minutes, so it wasn't pretty bad for take-out. As of the food, it was so-so, as the Fried rice was too dry and it was extremely mushy as if it have been cooked over and over again.  The vegetable dish was completely horrible - it just tasted like uncooked vegetables tossed in  loads of sesame oil and MSG.  The Shrimp and Scallop was a total rip off - you pay $12.95 for this dish and as I counted there was not even 10 shrimps and scallops in total - as there was so many vegetables in that dish!   Lastly, the major complaint that I have is being able to witness a chef in there (as it is a pretty open up kitchen type) sneeze without turning away to his side instead near the wok. After he just used his hand and rubbed his nose and proceeded cooking the dish.  NO WASHING HIS HANDS WHATSOEVER.  That is just disgusting."}
{"text":"I was driving home from an event that led me in the direction of this place.  I pulled into the plaza to see if anything would grab my attention and decided to try this place.  Since there were only two of us, we kept it simple.  Egg rolls, beef fried rice and sweet and sour chicken.  By the time we got home and got everything unpacked, i couldn't wait to dig in.  I must say it was a little bit different but very good.  The sweet and sour seemed to have a slight pineapple taste which was good, maybe a regional recipe difference.  The rice was good, the chicken wasn't a big dough ball like usual, so that was great.  The egg rolls were very good.  When all is said and done i would go here again, but i must admit, I'm not in the area very often.  But I would not mind another meal here, thats for sure.  The people were pleasant, the service was fast.  This was an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Cruising Oakville / Mississauga for some good take out \"fake\" Chinese food.  Found Empire Wok on Yelp.  Ordered take out dinner combo B for 2.  While waiting for the food there was a steady flow of regulars coming and going picking up their food.  Thought this was a good sign!!  Service was fast.  Portions generous.  Spring rolls were crispy and tasty.  Fried rice was way too dry.  Sesame chicken was crispy but sauce was too salty.  Spicy shredded beef was more like sliced beef in a goopy sauce that was also too salty.  Would give another go with different food to see if picking the combo was the mistake."}
{"text":"Pretty good \"what you'd expect\" Chinese food. Not amazing, but the food was hot and we'll prepared - and the dining room was clean. The staff was friendly. No great or terrible surprises. 10% discount for cash purchases when I visited."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for a quick lunch had there lunch special $6.99 sweet sour pork with fried rice good price for what you get plus you get a pop with that price ,but the terrible food, the pork looked like chicken balls no different and couldn't tell if I was eating chicken or pork never had such a terrible example of this dish , I am sure there takeout is no different not recommended."}
{"text":"I 've coming here since this place opened up, and i still can't find a better general tso chicken anywhere else . The lunch specials are decent for the amount of food you get . Service is always friendly and quick"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place a lot recently for my lunch break and I would say it's the best chinese fast/food around in the area.  The portion is great for the price you are paying during the lunch special meals which will definitely fill you up."}
{"text":"Just had a delivery and I must say I was impressed. The portions were generous, not overly salty and tasted fresh. This is my first order. Will try them again next time."}
{"text":"Lunch special is great value, they always give me a large portion. The combo platters are also very good value and they don't spare on the protein. Delivers fast and friendly service always. If anything, I had been looking around for many years for a Chinese food restaurant that I like and would stick to always, bounced around a bunch until I found Empire Wok. Now I've been strictly ordering from them for the past 6 years."}
