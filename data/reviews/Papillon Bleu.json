{"text":"Super friendly, fast service, and excellent food.  Reviews say not good for kids but my kids loved it.  I'd say not so great for kids under 8-10, but I don't see any reason to shy away otherwise."}
{"text":"Food is delicious ! Wonderful staff, friendly, sweet and funny. Chinese food in old Montreal .. Who would have thought ? Just like old times ..."}
{"text":"Wow, excellent. Boeuf a l'orange is awesome. Great place."}
{"text":"Best peanut butter dumplings in Montreal. Fried spinach and General Joe Chicken is THE best. Tommy has owned the restaurant for years and the food has always been great! All his chicken is white meat rather than the gamey scraps the restos in Montreal Chinatown use. He gets to know his regular clientele by name and memorize your orders throwing in treats of he likes you, Very generous portions for delivery. Super fast delivery or pickup. Dining room is fine, but usually empty as catering and delivery are his primary businesses. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Was doing an appearance at an establishment where they were going to provide lunch. Chinese delivery is what it was going to be. My pal asked \"You like Shrimp?\" I replied \"of course\". He ordered me \"Shrimp with Crispy Spinach\".  It was New-York Chinese Quality and at least Superb. I looked at the Menu after dinner and drooled.  I want to go eat there sit-down style next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Great food and EXCELLENT service; I would definitely order from here again! We ordered pick up and the person who took our order went above and beyond to ensure we knew where the restaurant is (without us even asking) and was at the door to welcome us when we got there. He made our dinner during our Montreal visit feel like home. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner.  I was the only person and the host/waiter was very cordial and helpful.  He said they usually do lunch and deliver for dinner.  Hot and sour soup was ok.  Dark brown broth, pretty thick. Not an over abundance of vegetable or other items.  I had fried spinach as an appetizer.  Its super good.  I have never had it.  It is light and flaky fried spinach sprinkled with sugar and garlic I think.  Made me feel healthy but tasted like candy.  I had General Tao chicken at the waiter insistence.  Large chunks of chicken in a mild spicy / sweet sauce.  It was good, but I would have like some vegetables or pineapple or something to cut the sweet chicken taste.  It was a huge portion and I could only eat half.  Overall ok.  $27.59 plus tip for meal."}
{"text":"Looked for a close inexpensive restaurant on a Saturday night at 7pm.  Saw this on yelp and decided to try it.  The place was nearly empty but could handle a crowd of 100.  Service was quick.  No draft beer but that was okay.  Ordered asparagus egg drop soup, crispy duck, and shrimp fried rice; all were very good.  I would recommend you try this place."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had an amazing dinner here. The other reviewers were right to recommend the fried spinach, peanut butter dumplings, and the General Tao chicken! We also had vegetable fried rice and vegetable mushu, which were equally delicious. The lone waiter/host was working hard for about 13 diners, but his service was still fast, friendly, and even funny. To top it off, the prices were great: just $10 for our main courses, and there were a lot of great lunch and dinner package options as well. We're definitely going back!"}
{"text":"We always do takeout or dinner in. What ever dish you order, the food is always good. When dinning in, the service is always fast. The owner is nice and enjoys making conversations. He remembers us whenever we order there :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic gourmet Chinese food. That's as straightforward as it gets. A three-course meal with drink for under $20 CAD that is high-quality, authentic, and yummy. It is very quiet at dinnertime; during the day is their usual rush (according to the owner.)"}
{"text":"The food was mediocre at best. The appetizers weren't terrible but the main courses left much to be desired. The service was really not great. We had to wait forever to get our order taken. The General Tso's wasn't terrible though :/"}
{"text":"Ordered take out from here on a Monday night. Got there at 9:30pm and the place was dead. It closes at 10pm and the guy told me that they were busy earlier.   It is fairly priced. I got the chicken corn soup and the cashew nut chicken. Both were very good. I asked for chilli oil and they gave that in a separate container. That did the trick for me. They don't have brown rice, and give you option of white rice or fried rice.   Portions were very good. Definitely recommended. Very near Embassy Suites, Westin and Inter Continental hotel in Montreal Downtown."}
{"text":"A Chinese restaurant in Canada that accepts American Express. It's like finding a unicorn! The food was better than I expected for Chinese delivery, and did not disappoint.   Delivery speed was very fast considering it was lunch time. Delivery person was very polite and had no issue following instructions to call me from my building lobby.   My crispy shrimp was soggy but that was definitely my fault for ordering that dish to be delivered rather than eating it in house. I've had crispy shrimp enough times in my life to know that this dish is well made and would have been fantastic.   Wonton soup was average, the wontons themselves seem to be handmade in-house, but I could be wrong on that.   Per yelp reviewer's suggestion, I ordered the fried spinach. I personally did not like it as it was too sweet for me, but it was well made for what it was."}
{"text":"Dinner for four here last night.  I had one of the dinner specials, shrimp with crispy spinach.  The crab and asparagus soup was tasty, the asparagus pieces were nice and crispy.  The egg roll and dumplings that came with dinner were OK.  The entrees were OK, though the vegetable moo-shu was pretty bad - my wife thought it was way overcooked.  My shrimp was pretty bland, the spinach was crispy and *very* sweet.  The four of us agreed on 3 stars - nothing was horrible, nothing was particularly flavorful.  They need to use more ginger and garlic in their recipes.  Service was OK, considering we were the only people in the place.  It wasn't the weekend, didn't expect big crowds, but you always wonder when you go into a restaurant and there's nobody else there, and nobody comes in while you are there...  We were looking for a light dinner and this filled the bill, but I wouldn't go here if you are looking for great chinese food."}
{"text":"Fantastic service and food with reasonable price! The package is really good!! good Tso Chicken"}
{"text":"Was stuck in the hotel on a visit to Montreal. Decided to order from here as it was the only thing that was open for delivery at the time. Went ahead and ordered the fried spinach and general tao chicken.  Food arrived quickly. Didn't mention I was paying with card and I payed dearly for that mistake as the delivery man expected cash upon delivery. The only draw back.  General tao was one of the best I've had to date. What made it great was the fact that the chicken pieces were actual chicken pieces and not majority batter.   Fried spinach was new for me. I expected more of a stir fry but the spinach came all crispy like chips. Never had crispy spinach with sugar before but it tasted great(probably a trip to the hospital for diabetes).   Would order again if I come back to Montreal."}
{"text":"The service here really makes this place. I'm not sure I've ever had better service even at Michelin stared restaurants.   We started with the Hunan Dumplings with the peanut butter sauce. I love peanut butter, so I loved this! The sauce was a little strong in flavor, so you couldn't taste the dumplings. This didn't matter to me because I love peanut butter.   For dinner my husband had the sesame beef and I the orange chicken. The beef was good, but the chicken was better. As others have said, the difference here is that it's real chicken rather than the heavily breaded friend chunks of meat I'm used to at other Chinese restaurants.   We each also had a Chinese beer that was quite nice.   For being in the old port area, this place is so reasonably priced.   We had enough leftover to take back to our hotel. Our waiter boxed it up for us and included places and utensils. That sounds simple, but it's little touches like that which make this service really stand out.   Highly recommend!

{"text":"It was amazing!   Right across from westin hotel in old Montreal.  We were 6 people including 2 kids and we all LOVED our meals.  Try the dry rubbed ribs, sesame beef and spring rolls."}
{"text":"Run away from this one! Food was very bland, no taste and expensive. Waste of a dinner and money"}
{"text":"Quiet spot near the Notre Dame Basilica....I ordered Repas Szechuan \"A\" which comes with soup, spring roll, hunan dumplings, mixed vegetables, General Tao, Szechuan shrimp and steamed rice. I was skeptical of the Hunan dumplings, which were served in a peanut butter sauce. I was pleasantly surprised! It was very good! Everything else was hot, fresh and good. Way too much food for one person. Excellent service! Worth the try."}
{"text":"I was hoping the 1.5 hour wait for delivery would have been worth it but I found the portions for the dinner for 2 rather small. Just a few pieces of everything for each person. I ordered beef and broccoli and good thing I did. The food all around was rather bland and lacked any sort of flavour punch and really wasn't worth the $60 dollar bill. First and last time ordering from here."}
