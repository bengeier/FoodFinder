{"text":"I hate to give this place a single star because this USED to be my favourite ayce sushi spot but ever since Yang's Sushi Bar switched over to \"Famous Sushi\" everything has gone down the drain. Ordering menus are on a white printer paper with no descriptions. Half the items are no longer available for lunch.  Seems like they have all new waitstaff who have no customer service skills. Their kitchen door can be heard slamming shut every time someone walks through in the entire seating area. Any questions toward the staff are met with annoyed responses. Used to be my favourite place but I just feel like all these changes have been for the worse  I definitely do not want to go back"}
{"text":"The food here is your standard AYCE quality, maybe slightly better ans fairly priced.  The sashimi was fresh and their chicken wings are really good.  So why only two stars?  -Too much rice on the sushi and no unagi. -The real kicker is the service.  Nobody smiles here and whenever you ask for something, you have to ask two or three times.  I had to ask for ginger, which is weird, but I had to ask for it three times.  You go in all excited to have an AYCE meal and you are supposed to leave satisfied.  I felt the complete opposite way.  I spilled some of my ramen on the table and when I asked for more napkins, they gave me a dirty stare as if I should be ashamed of myself for making a mess.  I'm sorry, but accidents happen.  Needless to say, but I left quite sad and was glad to be out of there.  I don't think I'll ever be back.  If you want okay food and can tolerate bad service, then come here.  Otherwise there are many other options besides this place in Mississauga for AYCE sushi."}
{"text":"Bad, so bad.  My mistake for choosing this over 168 - without checking reviews - because we haven't tried it since Yang's switched over.   Wednesday night and the max we counted at one point was 6 tables taken.  We knew it was going to be disappointing as soon as the server came over and barely spoke 2 words while \"greeting\" us and taking our first orders.  Doubled-checked with him and he gestured in silence that, no, we don't get iPad menus or even get to write down our own orders as in all the other AYCE places.  It was also a bit of a shock when other servers (never saw the first guy again) started plopping down our dishes without a glance or name or any sign that they willingly worked there.    I guess we entertained ourselves a bit trying to guess who ordered which dish - presentation was also a letdown.  They seem to enjoy adding fish roe or bonito flakes (dried fish) on otherwise vegetarian dishes which rendered them inedible to someone in our party.  The menu didn't offer any sort of explanation or note for what each dish contained.    Disappointing beef tataki - thin, completely frozen slices of meat stuck onto ice cubes (that was fun to separate with chopsticks /sarcasm).  The squid sashimi was literally the size of a fingernail.  We had just picked up our fried coconut shrimps when the empty dish was promptly whisked away - with the dipping sauce - by a passing server.  Several of the unique dishes shown on their menus were \"sold out\", considering we were early for dinner and there was an inclusive 10% service charge in the bill.  There were one or two servers that actually seem dedicated to their service, but with the mediocre food and frustrating service at standard AYCE price?  Definitely better options elsewhere."}
{"text":"They've changed the ordering to verbal rather than written, which is fine as long as the waiter understands you. The waiter we had was nice, but that's the high point of my meal today. Lunch was incredibly slow because they took forever to get things prepared. We waited half an hour between dishes and got maybe half of the things we ordered. We left fed up and not even full. I'll probably hit up Burrito Boyz after writing this. Now, I don't expect amazing things, especially from an AYCE place in Mississauga. I've been a regular at Yang's Sushi since they opened, but with this new management, the place has gone downhill. I can justify waiting if the food is good enough, but it really isn't. If you want good sushi and better service, go to Heart Sushi. Oh, and there's no mandatory 10% service fee there."}
{"text":"Ever since management changed so has the service. The group of us were quite disappointed tonight. Management is finding every way to cut costs which definitely will not help them in the long run when they lose customers. At AYCE restaurants you would expect at least paper to place your orders. However, they have taken that away and now you have to call someone over to place your order.  The maki rolls were decent but the sashimi was disappointing. Now if you order x amount of sashimi you'll get half of that. They actually cut a slice of sashimi in half. Now that is so cheap! They forgot one of our orders and sometimes gave us the wrong orders.  Service was average but that didn't help the cost cutting tactics Famous Sushi is using. There's also a 10% gratuity included in the bill. Last time I was here drinks were included but I guess not anymore.  We won't be going to Famous Sushi anymore. What are they even famous for?"}
