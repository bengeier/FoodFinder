{"text":"Belle is amazing! She makes coming here even better than the food itself. A great place to have friends meet up and hang out. The food is great too. Give it a try and you surely will be hooked."}
{"text":"Came here a few times after my night shift. Come in to unwind and relax in the morning. Great environment, food and drinks and most importantly have a really good bartender in Kris. She's always awesome!!"}
{"text":"So happy it finally opened. The neighborhood was waiting and waiting. I go in there at least three times a week. Football is a for sure. 50% OFF Drinks $5 Food Menu. Their new breakfast menu has amazing peanut butter and chocolate pancakes. And there is a breakfast happy hour 50% Off 6am-10am. Only place I go to game, drink and eat. Love this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"If you come to this location, ask for Ashley. Best server in this place..Not to mention the food is AMAZEBALLS"}
{"text":"Always disappointing. Food is good, service is bad. If you game you only get 1 beer per $20 in... if you win, you have to pay for your additional drinks. Last visit I wanted to eat but couldn't get them to take my order. Girls are cute but useless."}
{"text":"Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name and they're always glad you came. 
Amazing service,  friendly bartenders,  and a great 50% off happy hour!  
Liz,  Tiff,  Steph,  and Cece are the best bartenders in town!!!"}
{"text":"Great location, friendly staff, and really nice inside. Highly recommend!!  They have a pool table, nice lounge seating...just missing Golden Tee. :)"}
{"text":"Great place to watch football and can't beat the prime rib species for Thursday night for 8.99. Our waitress Bella was super nice and friendly also."}
{"text":"This place is awesome on their grave shift! The bartender plays awesome music and always takes care of me! Awesome neighborhood bar"}
{"text":"Ashley is a great waitress and Nick makes some fantastic food. Will definitely be back again"}
{"text":"I tell ya since this place opened up a few months ago, it's quickly moving up my list of Favorite \"watering holes\". Although, it does get very crowded on a Friday/Saturday nights, I like my weekend breakfasts or lunches. The staff is super friendly and very cool. Nothing beats a cold beer or a shot or two at this place. Cheers!!! :-)"}
{"text":"Food staff was good.  Bartenders were more attentive 2 regular slot players, which is the way of the \"biz\" in this town.  With that being said, I've been in this town for 38 yrs and have seen my share of places close down cuz they can't balance the gambling vs the neighborhood food/drinks crowd.  This is the 3rd time I've tried out this spot w/ the same feeling so I'm done.  Can't/won't recommend this location to anyone."}
{"text":"Used to LOVE  this local bar. Unfortunately  The food & service  went downhill. I'm very disappointed & will not be returning."}
{"text":"Went in before happy hour today. My drinks weren't entered in computer until after happy hour. He made me pay full price when I ordered before happy hour was over and he kept arguing with me that I placed it after when I had clearly placed my order with along with my friends. Their drink were the correct price and before happy hour. Maybe he's just homophobic? Who knows. Never goin there again."}
{"text":"I go there all time joe is always ready with my drink, the steak tacos r great!!! And tons of beer on tap"}
{"text":"Great beer selection, good food, and Belle one of the waitresses is the sweetest and all around great person. She alone is worth a trip across town to see. AWESOME service! truly one of my favorite places to hang, relax, and have a good time."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service from the bartender. I would never go back to this 1 after being judged & discriminated against. The cameras clearly showed I wasn't with them let alone come there with them. I'm not discriminating anything except letting everyone know to not go to your bar because of terrible service. I go everywhere in the area & have never had a problem except in this bar. I would never step foot in this place again! I've also got many other people that will never go there because of the way I was treated over a simple glass of house red wine & Prime Rib."}
{"text":"Usually come in on overnight to grab a bite of their poke tacos.  Very delicious and reasonably priced during their happy hour from 12-2AM if I recall.  I believe there's a new bartender in place of the coolest bartender I've come across (Steph).

I believe she's days now.  Never had to ask her for refills.  She always offered to refill my glass pint even before I ran out.  Greatly appreciate it.  She makes for great chit chat and gave a great recommendation on a keno game that had me going for hours.

In all, good food + reasonably price drinks on happy hour + good service + and how close this place is to home keeps bringing me back."}
{"text":"Nothing about this bar excites me. They had a nice B.J lounge over by the MGM grand but the lame Dotty's brought out the building. I wish the bar would do somethimg unique to get the blood boiling for a change. Karoke, trivia night, bingo or something. Shit, adding a Touch Tunes machine would help enormously. What happened to the female bartender's skimpy outfits? Come on man. EXCITE ME!!!!!"}
{"text":"So I just received a follow up email from Doug the manager about a experience I had at BJs.  He was super cool and followed up with me right away.  I liked the fact that he explained how their rating system works, but even more that he was so quick with his response and seemed to genuinely care about my experience in his restaurant."}
{"text":"This place has the rudest bartenders and the worst service I have ever experienced. Not only was there a piece of plastic in my girlfriends ahi tuna, I didn't even get an apology. Bartender Matt made me feel I was an unconvince for sending my food back. That is not right. I have worked in the hospitality business for over 16 years and I can't believe the lack of respect and service I got as a patron of this bar. But I still gave a 30 percent tip. I went there again last night to give them another shot and was even more disappointed than before. Beware before going. The staff is extremely rude. Especially the bartender Matt. I spent 40 on gambling and he didn't comp one drink. He also was using profanity behind the bar! What a sorry excuse of an establishment."}
{"text":"Yum! BJs is a great neighborhood spot! Good food and great atmosphere. Everyone needs a cheat day once and awhile and they don't make it as guilty! High quality tortilla chips and fresh sliced jalape√±os. They take nachos to while new level! Staff is friendly and the place is spacious."}
{"text":"Great happy hour specials. customer service out-of-this-world. got to try the lobster tomato bisque soup and lobster grilled cheese."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic and the service by Ashley was top notch.  It was completely unassuming from outside, but the cuisine inside was unique and a touch higher than traditional bar food. I had the Little Boy Blue sandwich and it had great flavored. We even had dessert (cookie ice cream sandwich).  Keep up the good work, we will be back."}
{"text":"The 3 stars is for the food I ate. Pepperoni pizza was pretty good. Went there midday and the only girl working behind the bar was just terrible. When I walked in there was only a group of guys whom she was taking care of. She acknowledged me right away, but then I was practically ignored the rest of my stay. Took forever to get her to come over so we could order our food, my glass sat empty for what seemed like forever, and, honestly, she seemed a bit drunk. She ran into a giant Santa they have near the restroom. She could just be ditzy. She hung out with those guys the whole time, maybe they were tipping her well. Im sure this place could live up to it's 4 stars during other shifts, just don't go midday when this swell lady is here."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! If and when, I do go I like going around 10p during happy hour. They have great happy hour specials: $5 Appetizers & $3 drafts ! The food is very tasty and staff are always welcoming, friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Saturday evening about 520. The place was PACKED. Ordered the Prime rib weekend special and it was off the chart amazing. The steamed broccoli was dry though and had no seasoning. The meal also came with a pizookie which was a cookie with ice cream on top. Oooooohhh it was good. The server was friendly and knowledgeable. I had ordered a long island though and sent it back. It tasted more like a lime soda mixed with triple sec. No bueno."}
{"text":"BJ's is a great local watering hole in the Southwest area of Las Vegas.  It is clean, not too smokey, and has a decent menu.  There are a ton of TV's and private rooms if you want to bring a group of people to watch some of the games.  There are game day specials and 3 happy hours throughout the day, so it is hard to miss their specialty menu with $5 appetizers and 50% off all drinks.

They are open 24 hours, like most gaming bars, but BJ's staff is very friendly.  The only negative is that service can be a little slow sometimes, because there are usually only 3-4 staff members there on any give day and if it gets busy, it might be tough to get a drink or some food.  

BJ's gets a big 5 star review, as they are the official home of the University of Florida Las Vegas Alumni Club for football and basketball.  They decorate an entire area of the lounge and have a complimentary buffet setup for all Florida Gator fans. 

BJ's is great place to stop if you are looking for some video poker, appetizers, drinks, and sports if you are in the southwest."}
{"text":"Its a great place!! I love coming here, they know how to treat their customers, the staff is so energetic and welcoming. Happy hour starts at 11pm, try their gyro sliders they are bomb!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots. The service is awesome. Always prompt and they leRned my name by the third time i was in and say hi as i enter. Great food too."}
{"text":"Joe is the reason I come here. He's the graveyard bartender. Come by and say hi. And don't forget to order food. It's second to none."}
{"text":"Liz, Stephanie and Cici make killer drinks...  Food from the kitchen is awesome-- great place where \"everybody knows your name\"!!  Happy hour from 4-6pm"}
{"text":"Went here after work a few nights and the graveyard guy was very attentive and nice. I had the burger here and it was delicious. They have great happy hour here on food and drinks. The private rooms with flat screen TV's are perfect for a football party or even a meeting since they can slide the doors open or completely closed. I hit a royal here, so their machines do pretty well since they are played often."}
{"text":"Stopped in with a coworker and customer this evening. Dining/lounge area was nicer than expected based upon visits to other BJs locations. Our server Belle was great. Friendly attitude and great service. 

Menu was slightly limited, typical bar food, but everything was good.  Lighting was a bit dim for a buddies night out at the bar. 

Will definately return as long as the service remains great."}
{"text":"I love BJs. Um I'm talking about this cocktail lounge bar in the middle of a neighborhood near Decatur and Windmill. They have Happy Hours twice a day 4pm-6pm and 12am-2am, I believe it's half off drinks. They also have Football specials, food and drink specials, friendly staff, and it's a nice spacious place.

Honestly I don't really wanna let you'll know anymore about BJs and their $8.99 Thursday nights prime rib deal. I really don't. Their Thursday nights prime rib deal goes from 5pm - 11pm or whenever they run out and they've already ran out on me once. I would call ahead since there's also Thursday Night Football. It's a pretty good deal. The prime rib ain't that bad though I usually eat it like my steaks, medium well. A lot of times it's larger than you'd expect, sometimes it's not. When it's not football season I've gone as late as a few minutes before 11pm and got prime rib with no problem.

The rest of their menu are actually pretty good, I'd say way better than the usual bars that do basic pizza and burgers not that they don't also serve pizza and burgers but they're good. The bomb shrimp bites are very tasty, so are the wedge salads, wraps, and desserts. Keep your eye out for their specials menu they had some lamb chops dish on it the other day, I really wanted to order it but I was craving a prime rib.

This location is spacious and fits the lounge atmosphere I think. They have lots of TVs and seating areas. They do only have one pool table but I think they'll let you play free as long as you buy a drink and some food, unless they were just hooking it up I don't know just ask.

The staff here always does an excellent job, they're very friendly and welcoming. Warning or fyi the ladies do wear some lovely attire."}
{"text":"The food was ok I suppose... I forget the name of the sandwich I ordered but the meat didn't taste fully cooked and it had some weird sliced peppers on it did not like that either... and the ranch dressing was not the best :( I love some good ranch with my French fries, which was basically my favorite part of the whole meal. My husband ordered the gyro.. said it tasted good, but was small for a gyro. 

Menu was also a bit overpriced in my opinion... Not really interested in coming back for dinner, maybe if we just want to have some drinks and play the machines. The bar service was great I will give them that."}
{"text":"We come here for the great food and the great service. Nichole is the friendliest...fun to hang out with bartender. We followed her to this location and are so happy we did!"}
{"text":"My first time there was almost at 9pm on a weekday. Food was on point. Delicious and definitely means I need to go a second time. Service was great. Super sweet. My boyfriend normally doesn't compliment service, but he said they were outstanding."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of Cheers (the T.V. show) because the bartenders and servers are so friendly and welcoming. I have only been during Happy Hour which they have one during the day and one late at night. Not only is the service great, the food's amazing as well. I had the sliders and kettle chips. The sliders melt in your mouth. They're pretty generous with the liquor as well. No watered down drinks here. You definitely get your moneys worth. BTW everything on the happy hour menu is $5, and drinks are 1/2 price."}
{"text":"Shavone is the best server! Cheap drinks and good atmosphere during their happy hour. They have a free pool table as well. Great space definitely must visit!"}
{"text":"Horrible service!!!

Have never been to a bar where the bartenders poured out the remains of my drink without giving me another or asking me if I wanted another. 
 
Once you actually get a drink, plan for there to be no alcohol in it. Their excuse was it was change over time, although as I'm writing this, the one bartender has been socializing with a patron for more than 10 minutes and the other is wiping down the counters with me still drink less. 

Such a disappointment..."}
{"text":"Went to BJs last night after not being there for months as they had amazing pizza before! Unfortunately the pizza now was equal or less then little Caesers :-/ The staff was obviously on drugs (bar tender and waitress) the waitress was giving out \"hugs\" which was everything besides making out with the regulars... Very weird. My wife and I have no idea what happened to this place and when we decided to leave the cook walked out from the back and basically quit or went on strike. He was waving his arms at the bartender saying \"no more food no more food they no pay me\" he was Hispanic and I felt really bad for him he looked like a nice guy. Long story short this place went to shit."}
{"text":"The bartender Stephanie was amazing, food was good; we went here for breakfast and will be back just because she was so great. French toast was French toast. Egg sandwich was indeed an egg sandwich"}
{"text":"Very very very very boring, where are the people? We heard this place was fun, some old guy alone at a table and two people at the bar, seriously!"}
{"text":"Now I remember why I don't go here...

Previous experiences with BJ's Cocktail Lounge on Decatur have been negative as well and I see nothing has changed.

I decided to give this place another chance and have some dinner and a beer while watching the football game on TV.

This place was DEAD at 6pm on a Saturday and not a single thing was going on.  

Don't waste your time going here or talking to Savannah, the bartender!   She was rude and looked like it was an inconvenience that I asked her for a menu and to change the TV channels to the football game.  She had such an attitude and chip on her shoulder.  She even barked at another customer that he HAD to drink his drink at the bar and could not sit on the couches a few feet away and watch the game with his friends.  He had also asked to change the TV channel to the football game and it seemed as if she did it reluctantly.

I would have given 1 star, but I gave two as the food was good...a simple BLT with a fried egg and avocado.  Sabrina, the server, was friendly with a nice smile.

When I went to settle, I was given two checks...one for the beer and one for food.  I asked Sabrina if she could combine the checks and she said it was done already.  I thanked her for doing that and paid my tab,

The issue was that Savannah decided to come over and rudely tell me that she combined the checks but from now on \"WE DO SEPARATE TABS FOR BEER AND FOOD FROM NOW ON, but it's combined!\"  Like she is doing me a favor...It should be common sense to get one check!  If that is the policy with BJ's, than why didn't Savannah take my food order from behind the bar?

I won't be going back...and that's shame because it is the closest neighborhood bar to where I live.  I'll just spend my money somewhere else."}
{"text":"Been coming to BJs for years. The staff changes often, but the service is always pretty good, as is the food. As far as bar food goes in Vegas, this place is one of the better places. The gyro sliders and potato chips are my fav. I always stop by when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Never been to a bar that starts a tab when you're in $100. 3 drinks in Vegas. Never going back there again, and I live down the steer. NEVER GOING AGAIN"}
{"text":"I won't be coming back here for a long time. The bartender that served me and my friends was incredibly rude! He charged us full price for drinks during happy hour and when we asked him about it, he gave a sarcastic answer along with an eye roll. He didn't even bother to apologize or anything! Horrible!"}
{"text":"Great place!  I have, officially, found my replacement football hangout since Roadrunner on West Flamingo lost my business.

The inside of this bar has an upscale feel to it and is very dimly lit, which made it appear more cozy.  There's a great lounge area with a wrap around couch and three large televisions to watch sports.  There are several televisions around the bar area and a seperate dining area that's also covered in televisions.

The food is great and low priced during the MNF specials.  The drinks were 50% off and were not only mixed very well, but everything tasted fresh.

I explained my situation with Roadrunner to the manager of this bar and a waitress and they were as shocked as I felt.  Their service was above and beyond and I don't think it had anything to do with having to make up for my horrible experience at a different bar...I think they're just this amazing to every single customer every single time you visit.  I'll be back for this Sunday's Texans/Packers matchup and most other games this season.

THANK YOU for a great experience!"}
{"text":"Great drinks good food, Hot waitress need i say more"}
{"text":"Food is surprisingly good. Poke on top of avocado!!! Anchor steam, dogfish head , and delirium on tap? Say whhaaa?!?!?"}
{"text":"I stopped in at approximately 4:30am and put money in a slot machine (video poker). I was fortunate enough to win a little bit so I decided to leave after playing about 30 minutes. As I was leaving, the female bartender told me that I had to pay for my drink. Are you kidding me? First time I ever cashed out in that toilet and they want to charge me $6 for a drink. Will NEVER go back!"}
{"text":"Will not be back! My wife and I were there today played $200 had 2 beers and 2 mixed drinks. Bartender gave us a tab for 2 of our drinks. I know it's not her fault but management clearly has no concept of how a bar should be run! Now I know why Saturday afternoon there's 1 customer at the bar!"}
{"text":"PRIME RIB THURSDAYS!!!  My favorite night to come in.  You get a gigantic slice of prime rib for $8.99.  They say it is 8oz, but I swear they are lying.  Closer to 16oz if you ask me.  I dare you to finish it all.  Amazingly, there are LARGER cuts available as well.  But come early, this special is so popular they might run out!

I think this is one of the nicer BJ's locations in town.  Upon entering the establishment, there is a humongous bar waiting to greet you.  The bar top is nice, made of granite or something.  I'm used to seeing bars with busted up wooden counters that have been around forever.  The bar has your standard Game King machines, but there are also ample seating around the bar without a gaming machine, so you and your friends can sit at the bar without occupying a machine someone else might want to play.  

On the right is a good sized dining area with booths and tables.  Last week we had a party of 14 show up and they were able to accommodate us in a big double table setup in the corner.  Seating is comfortable and the booths/tables are nicely spaced.

On the left there are 2 large screen TVs with long couch seating areas.  Great for 2 large parties.  I haven't sat in this particular area, but the couches look comfy and you can pretty much relax and lounge out.  Right next to this area there is a lower section with a pool table where everyone can gather around and have a drink and whack some balls."}
{"text":"The food was good. It was my first time hanging out at the bar and I was very impressed . The service was great. Julia was awesome.  I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Love the food here! The salmon with couscous is delicious! I come here every Thursday and Belle always serves my friends and me. Thank you Belle!"}
{"text":"Lame service. I got up with an empty ass beer glass, and stood there. All the staff had their back to me save one, that saw me, but she was \"off\". I sat down again, still nobody comes over. I get up again, they at least took my empty glass I brought to the bar away.  Don't waste your time folks. These girls got alot to learn about service. Basically I was able to write this review in the time it took me to get a f****** drink"}
{"text":"Don't go in if u r a gambler.  They have some odd rules regarding drinking/gambling.  You only get one well bev or beer per $40.  If you somehow win then they will give you a bill for what you drank.  It is the worst gaming bar I have been to.  Several of my gaming friends say the same thing.  Go to any other bar in Vegas rather than this place if you expect to be treated well as a gambler"}
{"text":"Bar service was great 
Budweiser on tap is way cool
The ladies gave taste tries if unsure what you like
Which you usually do see too much anymore
Food wasn't so great
I be weary

Just saying"}
{"text":"Good little place to go relax, grab a beer and have a meal. It's very pretty decorated inside, wasn't very smoky at all.....big plus!!!!  They have Wyders Pear cider which is my favorite beer. And they have a 25% discount card for ladies only. Ask your server to apply."}
{"text":"This is one of my regular stops, especially on Thursday, which is Prime Rib night (8.99/8 oz and also specials on larger cuts).  I also have the Ladies card which nets you 25% off AND there's a good happy hour!

Kind of in an out of the way spot (unless you're local to the neighborhood).  Very nice on the inside and has plenty of tvs and comfy seating, a large bar, separate dining room and a pool table.  BIG PLUS - although there is gaming at the bar, there's plenty of non-gaming seats at the bar as well.  I love this. It's one of my pet peeves to go to a bar and not be able to sit because i'm not a gamer.

Food:   Food is decent, but honestly not always my first choice for dining.  They recently revamped the menu and took some of my favorites off.  I go for the prime rib night and it's definitely worth the money.  It's tender, tasty and a great price.

Drinks:  I don't often drink beer here but they have an ok selection on tap and in bottles.   I normally drink mixed drinks and have been pleased with what I've had.  I also have liked many of the \"special\" drinks that BJs has such as the Marilyn Monroe Vodka with fresh strawberries and lemonade.  I've allowed the bartenders to just create something for me and have never been disappointed.

Service - From the first day until now (over a year later), the bartenders have been super friendly, fun, and provided fantastic service, especially Stephanie, Elizabeth, Julia, and Joe.  Drea rocks the food service.  They are there to make sure you have a beverage and a good time.  I've never seen them be less than gracious to any and every one who walks through the door.  Their capacity for remembering everyone is unreal.   I have been in there on happy hour when it's been crazy and they still make everyone feel like they are getting personalized attention.  They are wonderful.

Overall a fun and friendly hangout that won't break the bank."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for quite some time and I the new  bartender she is absolutely amazing. They got a new cook and I ordered three different things I'm not a picky however the best thing was the fries.... I did not complain however I did say something to the bartender the bartender said something to the cook and he came out, I said oh welcome and congratulations on your new job here. The cook was very defensive and I just witnessed him go out and question another customer because apparently another customer by me complained and said he wasn't coming back.  I am all about professionalism but if you guys keep this new guy here a lot of people will not be coming back and I love this place and that makes me sad even though I'm still here talking to the bartender, however will never order food here while he is cooking . Lamar is his name. I felt very uncomfortable and threatened as a female for how he approached me and completely intimidated me I really wish you guys would take a look at the cameras on how he approached me. Your bar is classier then this and I know it. Thank u."}
{"text":"Really enjoy this place, the interior is really classy. The amount of TV's they have is pretty nice, Food is very very good. Highly recommend to go eat and have a beer, go during happy hour that's for sure. Z"}
{"text":"Ok so you would never guess it but they have some delicious ahi poke!!! Comes on a bed of greens it's so fresh and delicious !!! Best place to go for late night happy hour . Classy decor and cheap drinks nice combo. Never had a bad bartender! Me and hubby are night owls and they always take care of all our needs! Nice lil lounge been too many times to count."}
{"text":"I love this new bar/lounge/restaurant/gaming bar on South Decatur.   

1 star = for their gaming bar that lets you access your players card information using your finger print; high tech!

2 stars = because they have TVs all over the place so you can't miss a single game!  They will even change the channel for you so you can watch the game you came to watch!

3 stars = super courteous staff; they are attentive, super nice, helpful, and even better - super friendly. They will remember who you are, and make you feel like home!

4 stars = FOOD!  The food here is high quality!  I love their salmon dishes, their prime rib which is $6.99 on Thursdays, their baked cookie with ice cream, and their Philly cheese steak!  Yum!  I have yet to try the rest of their menu, but so far they make me want to come back for repeats.  

5 stars = having all of the above in once place!  Love it here!"}
{"text":"breakfast specials from 6a-10a 50% off...and its down the street from my house...my Bailey's and coffee was more than the meal..nice atmosphere, feels more upscale than a PTs or BWW not sure about the rest of menu but will return for sure to update my review once I do.  Either way, I like the location, parking will never be a problem and driving home from a bar will not be an issue as I can walk to this bar from my house....definitely a neighborhood bar!"}
{"text":"Well if you read the previous reviews they were absolutely right.  BJ's was one of the best bars in town.  As a regular of over 3 years I've seen this bar slowly lose what made it so great.  When i first started frequenting the bar they had awesome happy hour for 3 hours twice a day.  Wednesday night all you can eat spaghetti, Thursday prime rib, Saturday shrimp dinner special, 1/2 price breakfast for early birds every day.  When you walked in everyone greeted you and if they knew you(which they made effort to learn your name on your first visit) proudly said hello with your name attached. Four of a kind card of the day changed every day.  Your points could be used as money in the machines. They have always been strict on comps.  $20=1 drink.  Don't expect much more.  Now the specials are nearly all gone except for Thursday prime rib.  Happy hour is 2 hours now. Every bartender i know no longer works there.  Its sad whey great places change what made them great.  The food is solid.  Especially if Nick is in the Kitchen.  I wish they would realize what all of us regulars are talking about."}
{"text":"Nice place, big but comfortable. Great bartenders! The best part.. the food is hands down amazing!! Great happy hour with awesome little food bites, I have been here many time and have tried most everything on the menu, I have yet to find anything that wasn't totally amazing!! Give this place a try, you will believe me then."}
{"text":"Love to come here for gaming, beer, drinks & food. Like seeing familiar server faces. I enjoy their beer selections on tap. Chix mac-cheese lusciously delicious. Patrons are happily boisterous making for a fun bar environment. Restrooms are clean and kept at a cool temp. Lots of parking & easy to get to."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. Inexpensive for lunch Lacy was so attentive to us our drinks were refilled with out waiting. I had a Gyro and my buddy had a pizza which looked so good. Check out the staff they are great."}
{"text":"This shithole! Poor staff, the women that own this place should be ashamed of themselves. It's the worst I've seen in my years. I used to love this bar. I live right down the street. Dump $200-300 in the machines no comp for additional jagerbomb, understandable but this isn't the ghetto. This place is on last legs. Owners should consider pot industry and stop fucking locals that will and do patronize over. Once again this is not about staff. The girls do the best they can with what these shitty owners give them, id hire them all in a heartbeat"}
{"text":"I dig this place!

I'm reminded of Season 8 Episode 7 of How I Met Your Mother where Barney Stinsen is trying to pick a new strip club to hang out at. By no means is this place a strip club... but I am on the hunt to find a local bar to kick it. I passed this place a couple times on the way home from Yoga. I finally decided to swing in because I was starving and I got fed up with trying to find a Gyro place to satisfy my craving after passing a Gyro billboard off Las Vegas Blvd. 

My first reaction when I walked in was the thick cloud a smoke that smacked me in the face. You'll get use to it after a couple minutes, but it smells like a typical casino. I plopped down at the barstool and was greeted by Julia, the bartender. Super sweet, easy on the eyes and a delight to chat with. She made my \"dining for one\" experience less awkward. 

The first thing on the menu was a Gyro meal. I was destined to stop here. I went with that and hoped that it would be somewhat decent. I wasn't expecting a knock out gyro, but for bar food, i was impressed. It came with crispy fries seasoned with rosemary. The gyro came with thinly sliced lamb with onions, tzatziki sauce, and wrapped in warm pita bread. I washed it down with a pint of Guinness and was perfectly happy. My bill came out to be 19 dollars with tax and tip. The pint of Guinness was $6.00, which is kind of pricey for a local Las Vegas joint. 

Overall, I was happy with the service and food quality. The smoking is a downside, but you probably won't find a non-smoking bar anywhere in Vegas. Price is average. This place is in the front running for my hangout. 

 A little about my credentials:
I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of dishes. I never became a professional chef, but I continue to enjoy & love food. 9 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I have a new passion for traveling and trying different foods around the world."}
{"text":"This place used to be called Ollie's and was closed for the longest time. I had never actually been to Ollie's, but I drove past it all the time. Finally and thankfully, the BJ's Cocktail chain bought the property and recently reopened it. Still, I had no reason to go there if it weren't for my cousin recently having a little Lakers/Thunder viewing.

To my complete surprise, BJ's is incredibly nice inside! It has an upscale style but maintains that local bar feel. We had one of the lounge areas to ourselves and it was very comfortable. I didn't get a chance to check out their full suite of on-tap beers, but I settled for a Stone IPA--not that that's much of a settle. The person serving us was very friendly and genuinely seemed to enjoy us hanging out there.

All in all, I left incredibly impressed. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Sliders: they were sooo good i had to go to CVS pharmacy and get the \"plan b\" pill.... TMI?   I dont care i want the world to know...  FYI Rachel and Dan and Mike a few of the bartenders there made me feel soo loved that I was able to stop taking my perscription of xanax for my chronic depression... sooo thanks for that Bj's!!!  Does anyone every win in that effing place??? hahahahaha yes they do!"}
{"text":"So the service from Kelly was amazing and I would only go back for her!  I'm a foodie and was very disappointed with the quality of the food.  If my rating was based solely on service I'd give 5 stars  unfortunately I can't!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great local spot to go to.  My friend Marie takes me here every time I am at Vegas.  The manager Jim is Amazing.  Customer service is awesome. Food is awesome.  Drinks are awesome. The local crowd is AWESOME and friendly.. okay, I think I pretty much covered why I love this place. The only negatives are: 1. it smells like cigarettes in here..but I guess that's normal in Vegas. (I'm from Cali!).   and 2. The sound system is not that great if you have one of the booths to watch any games.- but who cares.. it gets loud in here when a touch down is scored!    I LOVE THIS PLACE and will be coming back here each time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Have fun with the T&A, boys, cuz ya ain't getting anything else worth the drive. Yes, they get decent reviews - but these are written in drool. 

It's good the waitresses do dress like strippers, because service stinks. They are slow and dumb as posts. Seriously, better service at Denny's.

We sat ourselves, told them where we were and waited...and waited...and waited. Bleach-haired fishnets girl finally came over for our order. Cept we had a little problem...no menus. Took another 10 minutes. Got menus and water. Half an hour later, she returned for our orders. A member of our party very clearly ordered the margherita pizza, even pointed at the menu as she did so. 20 minutes later, the scantily clad blondie brought a margarita. The drink. Went back to the bar to order the correct thing. 

Another 20 minutes later, my chicken pesto pizza with no tomatoes came out. With EXTRA tomatoes. Under the cheese. Sent it back, knowing full well it would only get uglier.

Five minutes later, the margherita (pizza this time) finally came, it looked scarily similar to the tomatoey chicken pesto with the chicken picked off. Seriously, pesto margherita.

Keep in mind that we were literally the only customers. There were six of us. 

At the writing of this, we have been here for 2 hours. I'm sure they're spitting on my pizza. 

They get two stars only - and I mean only - because the food, once you get it, is pretty good.

Update, finally got my pizza. It was really yummy, but I waited so long that I was no longer hungry. My husband, who had eaten before coming was now famished, so at least it didn't go to waste. The waitress tried to make things right by giving us 50% off the remade pizza. Plus, we got that free margarita. Drink, not pizza."}
{"text":"Food is decent, service is ok. I used to come here every week but this place has gone downhill quick. What made me rate this place from 3 stars to 1 is the fact the sign you up for their loyalty program but you cannot use your points for anything. They are very cheap here, I suggest going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere & service! Love it here! The place was really nice inside too; had a litlle bit of an upscale feel but not pretentious, of course. But the staff was super friendly! And they have a lot of big screens and even a room with a pool table. Food and drinks are fairly priced. I had fun watching the NFL playoff game here. Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"I recently visited Las vegas BJ's hoping to share a good time with friends.  Unfortunately,  our experience  was less than great. Our Mojitos tasted more like lemonade. The chicken was pink inside. The pasta was undercooked and they had no mashed potatoes as offered in the menu. The broccoli was dry, dehydrated,  chewy. Our overall experience was very unpleasant.  Worst of all, the manager did not take the time to  speak with us. I would definitely not recommended this restaurant."}
{"text":"Very nice local bar.  Conveniently located within a housing development.  They offer a good menu with great food and a nice selection of drinks. 

Plenty of gaming options and a lot of seating."}
{"text":"Crappy place to game, spent $300 while watching my chargers win Monday night and only got soda comp. Then got ripped off from the waitress, put $40 in for a $32 bill then she took it to the other side of the bar and when we are at the door says we didn't put money in for the check. Total crap! Do not waste your money on these rip offs!"}
{"text":"Great food.. Excellent service.. Strawberry chicken wrap is my favorite and the ahi poke stack is the best"}
{"text":"Half of ANY drink and a great little $5 food menu late at night! I got the gyro sliders and herb fries...yum. It turned out they gave the wrong receipt out and someone unknowingly paid for our food...oops. Good for us, bad for them. Which brings me to my next point. This is the third time I've been here and the service is always spotty; thus the 3 stars. If you don't order right away, don't plan on ordering for awhile because they will run off and ignore you. I don't know about gambling, but you can do that there...as anywhere in Vegas I guess lol. And they have lots of couches, but I usually sit at the bar."}
{"text":"food & service is great if you go during regular business hours. I love their Romaine Wedge salad, but I always ask the cooks to cut it up for me. Don't order food in the middle of the night, the service is slow & the food always comes out wrong. Love the way the bar is set up. It is a very open laid back bar with a pool table & they offer girls a discount on food & drinks :)"}
{"text":"I love coming here during reverse happy hour especially when Brent is there, actually I've only been here when he is there. He's awesome and has this super chill vibe unlike other bartenders out there who just go through the motions. My friends and I were playing pool and he let us know when happy hour was ending so we could get our last orders in. His Kamikaze shots are by far the best I've ever had. The place is clean, there's a little lounging area away from the bar, a good amount of tvs if you like sports, and it's actually not too smokey. Food goes for $7 and it's really delicious. Definitely try the calamari, buffalo wings, and spinach artichoke dip."}
{"text":"I like it.

It's friendly, You will be welcomed the moment you walk in the door, the moment you sit down, and again when you settle in. Trust me, it's not overwhelming, it's sweet and it actually seems sincere. Everybody is attentive and almost determined to make sure you enjoy you time at this location.

Food is good. If you've eaten at a different BJ's, you won't be surprised. Happy hour is 4-7 and they also have reverse happy hour. 50% off drinks and they have a $5 menu of small items. We were there around 4 and ordered sliders, calamari... and my husband was dying to try their blackened chicken mac & cheese (not happy hour food). The sliders (2) were par for course and the calamari was quite tasty. My husband yummed up (made yummy noises while eating) his chicken mac and cheese.

Place is nice. Some seating areas remind me of the VIP sections at a Vegas club : plush booths, chairs, dim lighting.. very nice touch. They also have tables away from the bar scene and a pool table off to the side. It definitely has a classy vibe which personally, I didn't expect.

It's a great bar for my neighborhood and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"OK, 5 stars for a relatively new local bar that treats you like you have been a regular for years. As soon as you walk in you are greeted by the friendly bartenders.  On Thursdays they have a 6.99 prime rib special that is so awesome! My husband gets the double cut for 6 dollars more. The portions are actually pretty decent and both visits our prime rib was perfectly cooked. It comes with a side of mashed potatoes and veggies. The mashed potatoes are good and the veggies aren't bad, but I will say the amount of garlic that chef uses on those veggies is just out of control! Yes, I love garlic, but seriously it's like a whole head of garlic in those vegetables. At any rate, it's a great deal and a good meal. 

If you gamble, they have a players card log-in that's pretty cool. It's busy on Thursday due to the great deal they have going on, but the bar is pretty big. The bartenders are attentive and actually act like they enjoy their job. 

It's a very spacious place. I like the layout and the atmosphere is social and chill.  There is a pool table, comfortable couches to lounge in with your significant other or whatever you are into and a dining area. Definitely making this one of our hangouts!"}
{"text":"1st visit and last!  I walked into this BJ's location to order some food to go.  Upon walking in I was immediately greeted and asked what I wanted to drink almost immediately after putting $20 into the machines located at the bar.  As I played the bartender comped my 1st beer.  After playing for 10 minutes I played another $20 bill.  ($40 total). The bartender brought me a receipt for the 2nd beer.  Along with my food.  The food that was extremely cold.  When I asked, \"you charge your players?\" She went to her screen and said you only had $40 \"coin in.\"  

I am a local to Vegas and I have never seen a bar use this tactic to not comp their players to save money.   I spent 15 minutes in that bar, gambled $40 and I was only comped 1 beer.   I steadily played all my winnings and losses at $2.50 a hand.   The food was a 1 on a scale of 1-10.   This isn't how you manage a bar.  This will be the last time I ever visit ANY BJ's location.  I use Yelp all the time and the reviews determine where I eat, drink, and play.  Hopefully patrons read my review and go somewhere else.  

A better suggestion to go in Southwest Vegas near this location would be BAR.  (Born and Raised) Phenomenal drinks, comps, food, and atmosphere where they take care of their players."}
{"text":"I've been to this BJ's location several times and this is easily one of the nicest neighborhood bars I have been to. They have friendly staff members, tasty food,  and plenty of drink selections. Plus, the large open interior is stylish, clean, and complemented with comfortable bar seats. 

This spot covers all the essentials: video poker for the players, pool table in the corner for the hustlers, tvs mounted above the circular bar to keep the sports fans happy, separate dining area, and even a lounge area loaded with couches for those who like to get comfortable and socialize. 

There's a decent selections of draft beers here (Delirium Tremens got my attention) and I really enjoyed the food selections I've tried from their kitchen. Their mac and cheese entree is topped with seasoned chicken, bacon, mushrooms, and lots of gooey cheese. Also, their marinated chicken wings aren't fried.  Instead, they're braised first and finished off on the grill. I could taste the delicious difference. Overall, the menu has a good variety of bar food selections to choose from.

I'll definitely be back here in the near future to catch their happy hour food and drink specials."}
{"text":"The food is amazing!! Try the lobster grilled cheese for $5 on happy hour and finish it off with the greek lamb chops. You won't be disappointed. I got great suggestions from the girls behind the bar, and was pleasantly surprised to find local beer on tap. Three Joseph James handles and a Tenaya Creek, and decent options otherwise (though my friend would have loved to have a Fat Tire). Overall I had a great experience. Great service, great food, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I feel most BJ's are similar and Okay. It's a chain after all. The service here was good, and they had a good deal for HH. Nice ambiance with a pool table for FREEEE. There's also a nicer lounge-y area to sit, so I'm all for it."}
{"text":"Quaint little place on the Southwest side of town. After much coercion from my out-of-town friend I ventured my way over, walked through the double doors and found myself greeted by HOT friendly bartenders. 

The decor was muted browns and had a quirky wall piece which consisted of men scaling the walls (kinda like army men figurines). Had a good selection of beers on tap and probably a full bar. 

The food selection was pretty good as well. Between the five of us, we shared lobster dip (A+), meat lovers pizza (A) and Nachooooos (A+), which had actual peppers that left my mouth on fire."}
{"text":"Great amazing service food and beautiful women. Seriously I don't how far this place is from the condo you'll make the drive. Awesome experience. Make sure Nikki is working! She's the freaking best! Heart her!"}
