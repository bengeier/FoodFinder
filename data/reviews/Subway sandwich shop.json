{"text":"I tried the chicken teriyaki sub today because it was Monday and it was the sandwich of the day. Because the chicken sits out I told her to cook it I wanted it hot. She also was pretty heavy-handed with the sauce which made the sandwich soggy. When I bit into the sandwich the chicken was cold. The bread was wet and Soggy. Very disappointed. I bought a drink and went to get ice tea it was empty."}
{"text":"Had to give it 1 star to write this but in reality it doesn't even deserve that. When does it take 20 mins to prep 1 sandwich, I swear it's ridiculous. Slowest crew I've ever encountered. Corporate needs to do more surprise visits here or the owner needs to be more involved with the staff here."}
{"text":"Took forever to get a sandwich. There were to guests in front of me only getting 2 foot longs and a 6 inch combined. I was in there for over 20 mins an there were two subway employees working the counter. Will not come back to this location. Update... while eating my sandwich that I ordered toasted, it was hardly even warm. Only about 5 min from leaving the place. Bread was not toasted nor the cheese melted at all. This place used to be ok but now has gone to complete crap. The two male coworkers there had no sense of urgency and did not even greet upon arriving."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO TO THIS SUBWAY. Besides the employee being as SLOW AS  MOLASSES, he was also disgusting! My husband and I waited in line for 15-20 minutes for this employee to make 2 sandwiches for one person in front of us. Once finished he started on my husbands sandwich by putting on new gloves SCRATCHING HIS HEAD and then continuing to fondle my husbands sandwich. When I pointed it out to my husband the employee scratched his head thoroughly a second time with his fingers and then proceeded in making his sandwich. I tried to confront the employee and was ignored. So we left. TERRIBLE SERVICE. UNSANITARY.  DON'T GO HERE."}
{"text":"Here's my theory, the young lady behind the counter caught her bf cheating on her the night before, so she decides to come to work and mess up everyone s sandwiches ...The End
But besides apprant sloppiness and lack of love and care placed within this sandwich, it was pretty good as most subway sandwiches are."}
{"text":"Subway is always GREAT it's 11:30pm there's about 3 groups of customers here and this guy is working his ass off by HIMSELF I give him so much credit. I know the feeling the pressure. I will be coming here often. Thanks ponytail guy at Subway :)"}
{"text":"I like this location.  Drive past the Subway on Nellis to come here.  Always clean and the service is friendly.  They also serve Coke products which is a must for me.  The Simple $6 Menu comes with a 6\" sub, 21oz drink & chips.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"GOOD

Its a subway for goodness sakes...so won't go in too deep.

The staff was super friendly (1:15p) everyone had a smile on their faces.  We even chatted about the Crispy Taco flavored chips vs. Fried green tomatoes...had all the ingredients looking fresh in the bins (no soggy vegetables like some subways do). Breads were fresh and   all the different types still available. 

Place is clean even a nice sitting area outside under the trees...if you don't want to sit inside.

BAD
Not enough signage for the location...kinda hard to find...nestled in the back corner by Cosmoprof...cant see signage from street.  
Way to go afternoon subway team! 5 stars all around!

Not sure why previous reviews were 1 star?"}
