{"text":"Authentic Hawaiian food! Lived on Oahu 3 years and hadn't found a place with real Hawaiian food in AZ until now! So ono!"}
{"text":"We are always searching for \"the\" place where we can enjoy local favorite foods like kalbi, katsu, hamburger steak and fried saimin and have it taste like the ono local foods of Hawaii. We're still looking for that place here in Arizona. Kahu Hawaiian BBQ was ok. Not bad. Not great. Basic menu which is fine, not overwhelming like some others. We ordered the BBQ mix (chicken/beef/kalbi) and the shrimp/fish combo. Food was hot but the chicken/beef/kalbi tasted the same. Yes one could say they use the same marinade since it's \"bbq\" but to be great you need to know that you're eating different things. The shrimp/fish were good, nothing much to write about. Food is served on a bed of steamed veggies (cabbage and two broccoli) with two scoops of white rice and a scoop of mac salad (mayo, onion, carrot, tuna). Prices were standard. Food amount was filling (though my husband was only able to satisfy his hunger after eating his plate and what I wasn't able to finish). Overall reminiscent of Ono Hawaiian BBQ (also just ok in my opinion). So far Leo's Hawaiian BBQ is still the leader of our taste buds."}
{"text":"Delicious! It's very similar to Ono Hawaiian bbq. The best thing about this one is it has a drive thru! The food was really good and had lots of flavor. Would definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"So happy that I have a Hawaiian BBQ near by and its delicious!! Friendly staff and food always on point, if you like Ono Hawaiian you wont be disappointed"}
{"text":"One thing I do not like is trying new places, especially when I already have my favorite places to eat, but it was late , I was tired and it was super close to me. But it'll be the last time I come here. 1st I ordered the Hawaiian special I think it was that. ( chicken, beef, Mac, rice) anyways the portion size ?, I think It was less than a scoop of a ice cream lol 2 small bites and it was gone ( rice and Mac) A plate for $11.00 was worth $4.00  Chicken teriyaki was ok. The meat was literally just fat! I was upset! So I basically just had chicken with a tiny spoon of rice and Mac salad I think if owners want to make a  good business they should have a normal amount of food for what they are charging and better choices of meat! If that's what they are going for then good for them. They should just get rid of the cook! They lost me as a customer, which they probably won't mind because there's a lot more ppl willing to go \"try out this place\" ?. 2 stars from me 1 because they lady at the window was nice and other was because I don't know  still thinking"}
{"text":"Being a Native Hawaiian from Da Big Island of Hawai'i, I'm always in search of good Local Food here in the States. Kahu Hawaiian BBQ is a new establishment here in Phoenix, AZ and we wanted to give it a try. I ordered the Fish and Deep Fried Shrimp and my wife had the BBQ Mix plate, the food was ok but NOT great, the staff was friendly and the restaurant was really clean. Kahu reminds me of Ono Hawaiian BBQ where the food tastes the same \"NOT GOOD\".    I feel its going to take some time to get the right flavors flowing, but all in all, it's a decent place to get some Local Food. Mahalo Nui Kakou, Fa'afetai Tele Lava"}
{"text":"I'll start of by saying this is way better than (Ono Hawaiian) the macoroni salad is great and the bbq chicken, teriyaki chicken. They give great size portions was very nice. I'm gonna get this on the regular."}
