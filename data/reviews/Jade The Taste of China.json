{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I was worried at first that it would be a standard mall asian food counter but was definitely wrong. The food is fantastic and the service is great. I've been going regularly so that I can get the Teriyaki Chicken and Sesame Chicken. Each has a very rich taste, and the sauce/glaze is fantastic. This is the only food in the food court that consistently has a line, but the line moves quick and the food is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh delicious!!!!!! Can't wait to go again!!! It's definitely worth waiting in line for."}
{"text":"This place is probably the only redeeming factor of metro center mall. The mall is horrendous these days and nothing like the Golden days. However if you're still in the area and looking for some quality food then give jade a try. The food is delicious. Tastes fresh and the staff are friendly as can be. If I could only recommend one thing on the menu is would certainly be their crab puffs. Don't hesitate. Eat jade today."}
{"text":"OMG OMG OMG OMG FORGIVE ABOUT PANDA EXPRESS! This Is THE Best FAST FOOD Chinese place in the world. If only they had more of these open I swear they would make panda express lose all there business.  They so are not stingy with there food unlike panda, where sometime don't give you enough of something on the menu. The 2 entree plate is like your getting a 3 entr√©e plate you get so full that you can't finish all of your food I swear you guys that GOOD! I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE! Every time I get paid I come here LOL"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years. Yesterday we decided to get this for dinner. My wife got the chow mein noodles and orange chicken w/ a side of rice. I got the orange chicken and kung pow chicken w/ some rice. My wife was almost finished eating her orange chicken, when she bit the chicken in half and seen that some of the chicken was raw. She ended up not finishing the orange chicken. They do give big portions"}
{"text":"Good food, fast & cheap Great hot sauce too!"}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"The only food I will eat in the mall. All employees are very nice & the prices are good for the amount of food you get. Recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"This place was so delicious. They made my food fresh and were super friendly. The chicken shawarma is sinful."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely fantastic. I'm craving it as I speak. I like that brown rice is used for the fried rice. I've never had that variation before. The sesame chicken, orange chicken and kung pao shrimp were my favorite. I would highly recommend it. The owner is the friendliest :)"}
{"text":"One thing I miss about Arizona. They have good quality food and the employees are very nice. I haven't been in almost a year but I crave it regularly. My mother who still goes to Metro often stated that they upped their prices so she is no longer going which sucks as their prices were already a bit on the steep side compared to the same plating options at similar food chains. I have since moved out of state and can't find anything that can quite compare."}
{"text":"I just ate at Jade, was my second time, and it is far away my favorite Asian food in town!  The owner was actually working the front line and I let him choose his favorites for me.  I met him once before when he was catering an event for a friend of mine and that's when I feel in love with the food!  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I've been going here for 30 years and getting nothing but the BBQ Pork Fried Rice. In all those years, I've never found better BBQ Pork Fried Rice anywhere else. And in that time, I've lived in Minneapolis and New England. When I return to Phoenix to visit friends and family, I always return here for the best BBQ Pork Fried Rice anywhere!"}
{"text":"I am down from 5 stars to 2 stars. After 20 years, I guess food is going to change. The people that made the food delicious and unique, to every other Chinese place, are gone. Except the sweet, wonderful cashier; who always makes us feel welcome. She knows my family, and always asks about them. She hasn't changed, just the food. The tall Asian woman with very short hair and bangs, is always rude... If we ask her a question, she just looks at you with contempt.. Very rude. She will  cause them to lose business! They have finally lost me. I won't ever go back. The Orange Chicken is typical of every other Chinese restaurant?. It has that orange color with the crunchy shell with little chicken in it... .. Sauce is dry... Noodles are dry... The spicy Chicken, which used to be my favorite, is not the same..new color, new sauce, big slices of onions. Also, they don't say Chicken gizzards, they just say \"chicken\". These gizzards have more stringy fat on them. It is still my favorite food there, but different. Good bye sweet  Cashier and parting is sweet sorrow, JADE."}
{"text":"Panda Express has nothing on this place. Yeah its a little bit more price wise but you get a whole lot more!! Taste wise its delicious and always fresh. The ladies here are so nice and sweet. Im not a Kung Pao type of guy but their version is really amazing. Orange chicken is always crispy and savory with that pungent orange sauce. Teriyaki is also good, they grill it and you could really taste the grill difference. I definitely come to this place even if I'm not in to shop(lets admit it, metro center mall is the cemetery for stores).  P.s - definitely reminds me of those California choose you items type of restaurants. Taste wise and quantity wise."}
{"text":"This place is nasty. What are they serving?!  I'm still sick from the \"chicken\" I ate 2 days ago. Gross!!"}
{"text":"I don't know what James is thinking--Panda Express doesn't compare.  I've eaten here over 50 times. It's always the same . . . it's always awesome."}
{"text":"I've been going here since I moved to AZ about 14 years ago and I've never had such incredible beef and broccoli, fried shrimp or fried rice anywhere else in Arizona. The women that have worked behind the counter for as long as I can remember are the sweetest, funniest and they always have great customer service. Which is hard to find in Metro Center, I love this place so much always 100% perfect!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been coming here for 10 years now. They're teriyaki chicken and sesame chicken is awesome! Generous portions as well."}
{"text":"Not spectacular or the best ever by any means of the imagination but if you're stuck at metro mall for lunch or dinner, the best choice. Food is relatively fresh, family-size portions are tasty. Employees are really sweet and quick. Prices are fair. Ambiance is almost nonexistent but in a way, makes the food shine with little to no distractions."}
{"text":"Set low expectations and be content - This place sits at a food court inside a rundown mall . This is my first visit to the mall. The mall is definitely on a steep decline and is sparsely populated with tenants who would typically occupy strip malls.  I had low expectations and they served me well. Afterall, the food is  served on a Styrofoam plate with plastic fork. I ordered two items with brown rice - yes, they actually have steamed brown rice. Yay! Kung pao chicken wasn't so bad. Veggies weren't over cooked. If I'm back in town nearby and need a fast food, I may come back if I'm desperate."}
{"text":"Whoa. Picture Panda Express but 10x better food and customer service. The Kung Pao chicken is amazing! It's too bad they're in crappy metro center. They would run Panda out of business if they went to Arrowhead!"}
{"text":"Agree with most of the other reviewers, Panda has nothing on this place. The food goes beyond standard mall food and would be right at home in a nice traditional restaurant. The portions are great and the customer service follows suit. Honestly you have no reason not to eat here.. In fact, writing this review has made me hungry, so I think I'll stop by again!"}
{"text":"Very easy place to order. Staff is pretty nice and place was spotless. Taste of jade is location in the malls food court I hope y'all enjoy this as I did. Definitely recommending this to all of my friends"}
{"text":"Hand downs my fav quick Chinese food place ever!!! Food always tastes fresh, it is bit greasy but hey what Chinese food place isn't? Other than that this place is a 5 star Great food great service!"}
{"text":"spicy chicken bowl is my favorite!!!  love coming here, WAY better than panda or any other place I've been to! and the staff is always so sweet and funny!!! everything here is delicious."}
