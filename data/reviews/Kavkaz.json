{"text":"Excellent cuisine, chef is a boss, waitresses are goddesses and it's always a pleasant vibe."}
{"text":"Morton's and Ruth's Chris move over!
Don't let the ethnicity fool you - the grilled meats and fish are fantastic. Unassuming easy dining and always delicious. Your go to neighborhood authentic charcoal grill. We debated whether to let anyone else know about this hidden gem- but decided to share!"}
{"text":"This is a nice little restaurant serving middle eastern / kafgaz cuisines. The specialize in meat dishes (lamb mainly) and fish. We tried the lamb shish Kabab and bass fish dishes. Both were very tasty. The fish was really delicious and had a nice sauce (some of sort sour and sweet molasses). Their tea was nice too."}
{"text":"What a great place! We went there with friends after reading some Yelp reviews. The food is excellent, I loved lamb shishkebab, it was well spiced and really delicious. We shared appetizers and qutabi(?) and dolma were very good. My husband had lavangi and he said that it was excellent too. We will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Quail kebab was delicious - tastes heavily of charcoal grilling, and the dinner comes with two quails which are cut into four pieces total.  Although it's called \"kebab\", the skewers must've been removed before being served (not served as cubed meat, like what comes to my mind when I hear 'kebab' or 'skewer).  It was so nicely seasoned that I didn't even use the side sauce it came with, which is a real rarity for me.  Picked the side of homemade potatoes, which are potato coins with garlic and dill.  These yummy potatoes were only made more appealing with dollops of sour cream stolen from our friends who ordered the Russian pelmeni (perogies).
Also really enjoyed the Israeli fried eggplant salad which was perfect to scoop on the free bread (which can be refilled) - the large serving is enough for two people.  Live music, comfortable seating, reasonable pricing...looking forward to returning to Kavkaz!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for Georgian and Russian food. I usually get skewers and meat dishes, their potatoes are really good too, fried in thin slices. Out of soups, I tried kharcho which was great. On Fridays they usually have live music and dancing so it can be a bit loud but adds to the atmosphere. The prices are average and the food is quite filling so it's a good value."}
{"text":"Azerbaijan?! Just like trying to find the country on a map, this small restuarant is hidden inside the Shoppers plaza on the south eastern corner of Dufferin and steeles.

The decor is really nice, with nice ceiling patterns. There is also an area with mics and stools, which I persume there are live performances during the evenings.

The starter bread was nice and crisp. It reminded me of a pretzel, which complemented nicely with the home made pickles and cabbage. I got the daily lunch special, which included a borsk soup, minced beef kebab and salad. 

The kebab was really flavourful and juicy. The salad tasted super fresh, while the soup was not overwelming. 

The service could be a bit lacking at times since there was only one server. However, the food and my new found love for food from the Caucasus will pull me back here soon!"}
{"text":"Food- The lamb combo with the potatoes was the best dish there. The Russian soup we had there was pretty expensive for what it is. The Quatabi was very similar to a Manakish from Paramount.

Ambiance- It was really clean and looks like it even has a live band 

Service- The service was great! The chef even came out to see how the food was.

Value- Average"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Sunday. They had lunch specials going on - I ordered the rack of lamb lunch special, which came with soup (choice of borscht or spicy soup) and side (choice of rice, salad or potatoes). It came out to a reasonable $11.95. 

There was bread and coleslaw to start. I enjoyed dipping the bread in my soup, and the coleslaw was good. I chose the spicy soup which was very tasty. (I tried my friend's borscht soup and I def preferred the spicy one). The potatoes were sliced thinly and had dill which was a nice touch. Lastly, the rack of lamb...amazing! Cooked perfectly. Tender and tasty. Highly recommend if you enjoy lamb."}
{"text":"The food was good, especially the lamb and aubergines. We came as a big group (12) and every other table was a group. The atmosphere was great too, made even more so by the live music; however, the service was not good. The 4 serving girls were just huddled near the bar and tried there best not to make eye contact with any customers."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a date night or a place that's fancy without being expensive, you can't go wrong. 

Meal wise, the menu is simple, but excellent. The eggplant salad is so good, we ordered an extra one just to take home. The khachapuri was also an excellent appetizer. It was freshly made, crispy on the outside and the cheese is not too powerful, so even if you're not a fan of cheese dishes, you should find this one to your liking.

The trout with pomegranate was fun. It was beautifully cooked, still moist on the inside and the season I gave it a great twist. The quail and dark meat chicken kebab were tasty and I personally preferred the latter. Finally, my favorite was the rack of lamb. It was just a party in mouth. They give you a nice sauce with the right amount of acidity to balance the meat, but the lamb was so flavorful I barely used it. It was just perfectly done. 

Finally, our waitress was friendly and gave us great recommandations. She was patient with the kids and smiling all the way. I felt she did such a good job I tipped her more than the usual. 

Overall, I'm so happy a local business like Kavkaz is here and I can't recommend them highly enough."}
{"text":"Having never tried Azerbaijani cuisine (a country in the Caucasus region), the food was so delicious and perfect for a snowy day.

Restaurant was cozy but modern and comfortable. Servers were kind and kept refilling the yummy baked doughy bread and sauerkraut-like cabbage/pickle complimentary appetizers. Tried the grilled chicken and lamb - both good, tasty and flavourful. Also a gold star for their standout entree side: the garlic parsley fried potato slices - soooo yummy, seriously choose this over rice if you can. Had a sip of their tea as well and it tasted aromatic like an earl grey but different.

We had an issue with our reservation last minute but they solved it nicely and were able to accommodate 18 of us incl a baby. Head chef called my friend and seemed sincere. An odd thing was their last call for kitchen on a Sunday was 8pm."}
{"text":"Amazing! This place truly deserves a 10!
As soon as we parked the car and entered the parking lot....this incredible aroma of charcoal BBQ and meats enter the air and You automatically start salivating and searching... Search with your eyes, 'where this amazing smell is coming from?!?'
And there it was... KAVKAZ!

At the front entrance you are welcome by a very inviting sign that says $9.95 lunch special! 
OF COURSE  we were automatically interested and entered, to learn more... We were wowed, fist impression: the place was beautiful, cozy and updated, clean and relaxing ambiance and friendly staff!
Very welcoming workers and kitchen staff, everyone was very helpful and knowledgable. 
Although they do not advertise their food as gluten free, the head chef / owner was more then happy to come out and not only break down exactly what's in what but also explained the way the food was prepared!
We unfortunately could not stay, to eat inn but definitely got 1 order of take out to try at home.
For $9.95 I got a huge container of Succulent Chicken shish kabob, it was juicy and full of flavor, sprinkled with fresh onions and herbs. On the side we got freshly sliced and fried potatoes smothered in herbs oil and fresh dill. 
This combo also came with a side order of soup (2 to chose; harcho or borscht) I strongly recommend both! and a container of dills And a side of fresh bread. 
Not only was this an amazing deal! But I almost ' swallowed my tongue' (is what we say when something is this delicious! ) mind you it took me 2 attempts to finish the whole portion, due to it being so generous!

Many of you who know me, know that my family and I do not shy away from eating our regularly and treating ourselves to high end cuisine and restaurant, from Blu
Restaurant in yorkville to Harbour sixty, and many more like it, we've been fortunate enough to have had these experiences, and although this by all means is no high end posh restaurant, it's beautiful interior and incredible food is what made us fall In love!
We will be returning and coming back for more and more!! 100% I strongly recommend everyone try's this place and support their business and let's hope they will open more locations!"}
{"text":"Went to this place on a Friday Night, and i have to say it is pretty good. This is sort of a cross between a russian restaurant, and middle eastern. It has a lot of dishes from many countries in that region. The quality of the food overall was pretty good. The dining experience was nice, the restaurant when you walk in was organized. It is definitely a great place for a family or friends dinner. The price was a bit on the high side, but if you try to share food with friends, it can be pretty good price wise. Overall the restaurant has a few dishes i would try, the chicken lavanch, which is a cornish hen they stuff, is pretty unique to the toronto food scene, and the potato as a side is a must. as the potatoes are much better than the rice or salad. The quail was not bad, and the meat platter was okay. the meat platter though is fit to serve around 4 people i believe, that is the best proportion you'll get as a sampler for all the different kinds of meat. if your around the area and want to try some food from another part of the world. Definitely give this one a shot"}
{"text":"My friend brought me here the other day around 11am right when it opened. She got me drunk lol. Atmosphere was very nice. Our Russian waiter explained all the meals to me & what comes with what. I enjoyed the food a lot, I can't remember the name of whatever I ordered but it was lamb and potatoes basically"}
{"text":"It is somewhat of a hidden gem, if you stop there for lunch. 

The food is great, with an excellent selection of grilled meats. The garlic potatoes are a nice touch. 

Can't say I liked their herring, as it was way too salty, and the onions were drenched in vinegar. Plus, when you serve herring with potatoes, the potatoes are supposed to be boiled, not roasted garlic. This is really the only reason to deduct a star. 

Will definitely repeat."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for a while and finally went there for lunch today. The food seemed similar to Persian food and being Persian i was curious to see how it compared to over Persian restaurants in the GTA. The restaurant is neat and clean and looks new or newly renovated. We tried a few different dishes: Kharchac soup, qotabi, Bassa, quail, lamb shishkabob and the grilled shrimps. I really liked the soup. It tasted very homemade and something like what my mom used to make. The bassa was also very good. The lamb was a bit over-cooked and chewy and not that great overall. The dishes came with the choice of rice or potato and rice was very nicely cooked like Persian rice. Overall the food was good specially the fish but for the red meat dishes i think the Persian restaurants are better. The waitress was very nice but working only by herself, the service was very slow. 

Food: 4/5
Service and atmosphere: 3.5/5
Price: 4/5
Overall: 4/5"}
{"text":"I was excited to try Azerbaijani food so I convinced hubby to take me to Kavkaz as soon as it opened so we wouldn't have to deal with the lunch crowd.

No hostess/waitress to greet us so we had to ask one of the cooks if we could seat ourselves. There's definitely a language barrier here, maybe that's why the wait staff were not very engaging with us and had a difficult time explaining the menu items. We sat ourselves at a comfy half booth and I grabbed one of the available pillows for my back. The place is nicely decorated and clean. 

We glanced over the menu and decided on the following: 
- Harcho soup - tomato based soup with meat, rice and fresh herbs. This was a delicious comforting soup.
- Quail kebab with potatoes - quail had good seasoning but was overcooked and chewy. The potato slices had good flavor but were oily.
- Bughlama with Lamb with a side salad - the lamb was tender and flavorful but it had a slightly slimy texture to it. The mixed greens salad had a light citrus vinaigrette dressing which was delicious!
- complimentary bread with pickles and pickled cabbage (I thought it was sauerkraut but the waitress said it wasn't) - nothing special especially since the bread wasn't even warm.

Once our food was dropped off we never saw our waitress again: there were two of them working and the restaurant was maybe a third full. We had to flag her down every time we needed something: water refills, to go boxes, the check (we had to ask for it twice). When the chef made his rounds, I notified him of the chewy and overcooked quail. He offered to replace my entree then started to explain that that's how it's suppose to be; I'm sorry but I just don't believe that.

One good thing that I learned is that I do enjoy the flavors of Azerbaijani food so I'm looking forward to my next encounter. I really wanted to give this place a higher rating but with food that's barely warm, chewy quail, slightly slimy lamb, the language barrier, and service that just does the minimum: I can only give Kavkaz two stars."}
{"text":"If you wanted to know what it would taste like if you doused quail in molasses and then burnt it so that it became stringy and revolting....order their quail with pomegranates. The lamb chops smelled being in a barn filled with the animals....I've been to this place before and the food was good but this time it was so bad that I don't even want to try it again"}
{"text":"I have to say that they know how to cook meat! I ordered chicken kebab which turned out to be very nice and soft, and my friend commented that rib chops were exceptional. The side salad was good as well.
The soup harcho was okay, nothing special. 
The restaurant itself looked okay, but a little gloomy and it was absolutely empty, which was very strange to me considering the location. 
Food 4.5 stars
Service 5 stars (can't really judge as we were they only guests there)
Atmosphere 3 stars

Atmosphere 3 stars"}
{"text":"Wow Yelp does it again! We hit this spot based on Yelp reviews and big GOLD.   We had the Qutabi appetizer (mixed meat & veggie).  The flavour brought me back to my youth, having Holiday meals at my aunts house when I was young.  Delicious ! 
The Borscht was on point and kept our appetites primed for the main event...

We both had the lulya kebab meal - basmati rice as my side- yummy 
She had the potatoes- which were sliced thinly and deep fried.  We added some light salt and devoured them.  

The servings are ample and you won't walk away feeling hungry.  The prices are very reasonable.  
The decor is perfect for a dinner date.  You can dress up and feel comfortable here.  Service is friendly and not pushy.  I'll be coming back with my family soon."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I have known the owner for years, and man is he customer oriented! Not only is he the chef, but he takes time out of day to actually go up to his customers one by one to ask about their experience. The food taste amazing! The chicken kabobs are so moist, idk how he perfects it! The babaganoush is to die for! I fell in love with babaganoush because of this place. This place not only has great food, great atmosphere, but it has a one of a kind owner that actually cares about his customers."}
{"text":"What a surprise. I never tried this type of meat. The chicken shish kebab has very unique flavour. Lamb is totally different from what I tried anywhere else. Presentation is excellent and service is very friendly."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, kebobs are very tasty and well prepared. The only downside is there were only two waitresses and the service was so slow that day. Overall I recommend this place and will go back again."}
{"text":"The place is a nice clean space with simple decor. We ordered the lamb shishkebab ($17) and the ground lamb and beef kebab ($15) and dolma ($12). The food was very good, though a tad oily and pricey for the portions. You get to choose between rice, potatoes and a salad for your side, and I'd recommend the potatoes like the other people here. It's crispy and seasoned well with dill and garlic. The lamb was also cooked medium rare to medium, and was really juicy. It came with a sweet, spicy and tangy sauce and it really added to the dish. 

The service was a little slow and they didn't really come by to check on us, but the food itself is worth coming back. I hope to come back to try the tea and the baklava!"}
{"text":"Food was great and atmosphere nice... Had the lamb chops, nice serving, decent price, potatoes were amazing! 

Fried eggplant was really good and the feta veggie plate was good too (simple but tasty).

Would definitely visit again and recommend."}
{"text":"Went there three weeks ago for  the first time and were impressed! The food was great, home made baba ganoush is the best I have ever tried. The servers were very nice, friendly and quick. 
As it was Saturday night and someone's birthday there was also live music.
Would definitely come back there and recommend the place if you want to have great food for reasonable price."}
{"text":"Kavkaz is cozy and has great value for the lunch meals. I had my first Azerbaijani food experience there. The beef and lamb skewer was prefect (Lubya plate, I think), flavourful and perfectly grilled. The side of potatoes was delicious with slight garlic flavour. This restaurant is so different and authentic (mix of Russian, Azerbeijani, Turkish), and is a testament to Toronto's diversity strengths."}
{"text":"Lovely place with Azerbaijani and Georgian food. Try qutabs, followed by lulya kabab and chased with Azeri pakhlava. I am sure all other dishes are as good."}
{"text":"I am familiar with most Caucasus (Kavkaz) cuisine as I am from Azerbaijan myself, so this review may be a bit biased, but still bare with me.

I was visiting an old friend in Toronto and he suggested to be a bit homesick and try national cuisine. There were 4 of us, and we arrived around 3 pm on Friday morning: surprisingly, place was relatively empty (a big table was reserved, so I assume there was upcoming birthday or smth).

As a tradition, we started with some soups i.e. kharcho (traditional russian) to warm up and the proceeded to appetizers: Kh/Qutabi (the best) and Eggplant dip (ask them to warm it up, it's really good). Qutabs are the best with greek yogurt, so it's must have if you gonna eat one. I recommend getting both with meat and greens, just to have different tastes in mouth. Eggplant dip goes really good with their own bread (make sure it has sesame seeds on top, lol), so it is a good filler in between soup and main dish. 

As a main dish, we ordered traditional Azerbaijani Saj, which comes in a huge tin/metal plate and burning coals in the bottom to keep it warm. They charge $18 per person for the Saj, and I assume they have minimum of two or three portions to order this meal. It was pretty good! Potatoes, beef, eggplant, chicken, peppers - all frying in front of your eyes is something irreplaceable :) 

One of my friends knew the chef too, so we were suggested to celebrate with a bit of vodka, which was pretty good complimentary to Saj, so might as well give it a shot.

Overall, I was very proud that we had a beautiful, cozy and national restaurant in Toronto, and it definitely made to my must-visit location list for Toronto."}
{"text":"Really amazing food. Good variety and great service! Thanks for the great experience. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant yesterday after reading the reviews, and wanting to try something different, and was not disappointed.  We had the herring appetizer, served cold, and the baba ganoush.  Both were very good, the baba ganoush was quite garlicky and creamy.  For entrees, the salmon kebab, and the chicken tabaka.  The chicken is pressed flat, and grill while under a heavy weight.  It was tender, with crispy skin, some of the best chicken I've had.  It came with a mountain of thinly sliced, fried potatoes, sprinkled with fresh dill.  Service was efficient, and friendly.  I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"My knowledge of Azerbaijani cuisine was non-existent prior to dining at Kavkaz, but consider my interest now piqued thanks to the quality of the food we ate.

We arrived around 12:15 on a weekday and the place was empty. The service was, as a result, quite friendly and efficient.

We ordered:

Lulya Kebab (\"mix of seasoned ground lamb and beef\"): Though it's a pretty small portion - a single kebab for about 14 bucks - I have to admit this was a really tasty dish. It reminded me a little bit of the Middle Eastern concoction kibbe, as both contain different kinds of meat mixed with exotic spices. The meat arrived piping hot and was incredibly flavorful, while the accompanying potatoes, though a little soggy, were a nice complement to the kebab. (And the included sweet and spicy sauce only enhanced both items.)

We also ordered a lamb dish. (There's no website for the restaurant online, and the few menus I found don't have it listed.) Anyway, it's even better than the Lulya Kebab. The lamb, mixed with an irresistible cilantro-based sauce, is amazingly soft and tender, while the accompanying rice only enhances the meal. I really enjoyed this.

We were also given a couple of freebies: An appetizer consisting of fresh bread, sauerkraut, and pickles (fine, but nothing special) and a yogurt-based salty beverage (again, decent but not something I would've ordered on my own)."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came up to Toronto for the weekend with no plans and certainly found a gem in this place. The food was outstanding and the atmosphere was super personable. The chef/owner made his way around the restaurant, making sure everyone had a quality experience. The kabob was unreal, the dolma was delectable and the fried eggplant was simply to die for. It was our first experience with food from the Caucasus Region and definitely didn't disappoint. Look forward to visiting Kavkaz in the future."}
{"text":"Omg! Take it from someone who is from the Caucasus- this restaurant is the real deal :) The food is amazing! I came here with my family and we loved everything. If you have not had the fortune of eating Kavkazi food, do yourself a favor and check this place out. 

The food: DELISH!! To start, we ordered Qutabi with all of the fillings- meat, greens, and pumpkin, which I'm guessing is a seasonal specialty. They were delicious and light, slightly crispy on the outside and dusted with sumac. The kharcho soup was comforting and full of flavor but SPICY! Then came the Israeli eggplant salad, which was very good on the house bread they serve before meals (ask for the bread warmed up, much tastier that way). We also tried the pelmeni, and if you're a fan of these little meat dumplings you will definitely like them here. 
For our entree, we ordered two platters of different shashlik with sides of white rice and potatoes. Let me tell you- I've never had lulya kebab like this before. No hint of gaminess in the lulya or the lamb chops. The chicken was juicy and tender. The thin sliced potatoes were AMAZING! Crispy and oily and just mmmm. I would eat those every day, We ordered two steeped teas with walnut baclava to finish. The tea is very enjoyable- not too strong and not too weak with good leaves. I liked the baclava but I wish they had more sweet offerings.

The service- fantastic! We had a lot of requests and the servers honored all of them. They definitely seem to care about pleasing their guests!

The music: FAB! I don't know their schedule but we were here on a Friday evening and a musician was singing a variety of songs in Russian and English. I never heard a Russian singer cover \"Hotel California,\" lol. Later, they played instruments. Very talented and pleasant guys! We definitely worked off those calories in the little dancing area by the mini stage at the front of the restaurant. The restaurant is called \"Kavkaz\" so of course they played lezginka and Azeri music, too.

The ambience: This isn't a big banquet hall like other Russian restaurants in the area, it's missing that...over-the-top factor those places have. It's a perfect mix of classy and casual. Some people were wearing dresses and heels and some were in jeans. Everyone felt very welcome here. Just don't come in wearing like, raggedy sweat pants, and you'll be fine. 

This is a great place to celebrate an important occasion, have a date night, but also to just chill with family and friends. I would DEFINITELY recommend \"Kavkaz\" to anyone who likes good food and music."}
{"text":"oh my god oh my god oh my god i got dinner for myself and my best friend and paid pennies my dude. this place is marvellous with authentic european (mainly russian) food. if you're looking for something to hit the spot either with friends/family, go here."}
{"text":"I got takeout from this place.  The chicken was tasty but the food portion was really small for what we paid.  Around $40 for 2 containers of chicken/lamb pieces and some homemade potato chips.  Didn't feel like it was worth the value."}
