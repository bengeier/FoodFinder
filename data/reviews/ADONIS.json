{"text":"I had been hearing about this great and amazing Adonis on the south shore and finally had to try it.  First, the parking is super tight and, Normal cars can barely fit in, not sure if the whole shopping center is like that or not.  The layout is pretty much the same as others,, but there was barely any lineup except at the grill counter.  They do have a couple of things going for them: 1) an eat-in section and 2) they can actually grill or fry your seafood on the spot (4 to 5 dollars a kilo extra)  Aside from the cashier, the servers at the deli counter were definitely surly and didn't seem to be enjoying their job.  The prices are gonna be the same, they do have a few things i have not seen in the olives section that are nice.  Is it worth a trip just for that, not really, but i guess it's a welcome addition for people who live around here."}
{"text":"J'y vais malheureusement par nécessité, pour un produit spécifique que je ne réussis pas à trouver ailleurs, parce 2 expériences m'ont refroidi.   Lorsqu'on tombe sur un unilingue anglophone, nous ne devons pas nous contenter d'un \"sorry I don't speak french\" mais aussi d'un \"damn french frog\".  Dommage, le personnel est généralement courtois, les caissières adorables mais ce type d'expérience gâche tout."}
{"text":"So, I called here on Monday June 27 around 6 PM to ask about bottled water.  This woman who sounded lazy, and unhelpful picked up and then kept trying to get me off the phone.  I explained that it's a bit of a drive for me.  Oh and she barely speaks English/French.  Frankly she sounds perhaps Lebanese. Over 7 minutes later some nice competent fellow gets on the phone and says he'll check.  Then she gets back on the phone and starts speaking incoherent English again.  What do you want?  What do you need?  You have to tell me!  Then she's screaming in the background (YELLING) and I keep hearing the word 'water'.  Then he gets on again and says he cannot divulge this over the phone.  And, adds that this woman is a Manager.  To which I replied that the level of incompetence is flabbergasting.   Adonis Brossard has decent prices.  Although the inventory changes all the time.  The main draw is their delicious hummus, which also varies in consistency.  And, be sure the check the date.  We have purchased when it was close to expiration.  Great looking produce, competitive pricing, very lightweight on the organic selection.  Prepared food  counters.  Nothing especially healthy.  I enjoy the spanakopita.  It's heavy on the dough.  The oils that they use in their salads are not premium.  They don't really specify.  Customer service...you're not getting that for these prices.  As a customer who lives downtown and who typically buys organic, I regularly go to Brossard for groceries.  I buy from Avril and Lufa primarily.  Sometimes Tau.  I pretty much only go to Adonis for water if they have it for a good price and hummus and maybe some fruit that is ok to eat non organic.  I have occasionally grabbed frozen wild fish, if it looks good quality."}
{"text":"This is my first experience in an Adonis stores. I heard a lot of good things about it.  The good: The prices for fruits and vegetables are good. In general, prices are good. They have a lot of interesting imported products. The place is huge! They have a very interesting meat, and fish, and bread, and cheese counter for service. They also have a very nice ready-to-go counter. Cash service is kind of quick (on a Saturday afternoon), and the cashier we got was nice. They have A LOT of biologic and healthy foods.  The bad: Some veggies are rotten so you have to dig to find a good one. Counters are VERY busy, take a number! Some prices are NOT competitive at all, so it is good to know your prices. Old looking metal shelves.  In the end, this might become our new grocery place as we are changing our diet to a healthier one, and they have a lot of choices, at great prices. As far as the items at a non-competitive price, compared to what we save, it will be worth the purchase."}
{"text":"The south shore finally has an Adonis! It's everything you would expect like the other locations. Great produce and meats.  Their take-away counter in the back is great to handle quick suppers that maybe didn't get prepared the night before.   It is very busy here on the weekends. So aim to go Sat or Sun when they open, or during the week."}
{"text":"Je vais au marché Adonis presque toutes les semaines depuis quelques années déjà! Les fruits et légumes sont beaucoup moins chers qu'à l'épicerie et il y a beaucoup de choix. Le comptoir à viande est aussi très bien. Toujours frais et moins cher que chez IGA et cie. Pour les autres articles sur tablette, c'est généralement plus cher qu'à l'épicerie.   Les caissières sont souvent bêtes ou complètement silencieuses.. on n'y va définitivement pas pour leur service."}
{"text":"This is my second time at the Adonis Dix30. It's Monday and boy was my experience here better then the first time. I went on a Saturday at noon (no!no!). Service was very good. They were all smiles at all the counters and I didn't wait at all to be served. If you go for what's on sale, you can actually get a whole lot of things for not too expensive! At the fish counter, you can choose your fish and they can cook it up for you the way you want it (at an extra cost)! The marinated meats are delicious! The sides are really good! The sweets are out of this world! The bakeries makes my mouth drool! I don't know why some reviews mentioned the bad attitude from the staff because EVERYONE was very courteous with me (on both occasions)!The only thing I don't recommend is going there during the weekend. As a matter of fact, I don't recommend going to Quartier Dix30 on the weekends. ;)"}
