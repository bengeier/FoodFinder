{"text":"Tonight was my first visit and it was amazing. The food was great, the service was prompt, and friendly ... I have nothing bad to say. I had the marinated steak strips. They were juicy, perfectly seasoned, and cooked to a perfect medium just as I ordered it. This building has been a revolving door of different mediocre restaurants coming and going over the years. I really hope Johnny's is here to stay because I'm going be a regular."}
{"text":"I have been to Johnny's several times, and it was good.  Last night, not so much.  The \"real roasted turkey\" turned out to be fake turkey spam.  Mashed potatoes were real and good.  Green beans and roll were good also.  Dressing was too wet, and had cranberries in it, instead of beside it.  Unsweet tea could have been fresher."}
{"text":"Good home cooking at this family restaurant. Daily specials with large portions come out quickly. Easily get lunch in and out in less than an hour. I've only been once so far for lunch and got the daily special even after reading other reviews about the \"turkey\", yes it was processed but the dressing with cranberries!!! So good. Vegetable sides did not disappoint. I had fried squash and collards. 4 stars due to the processed turkey, otherwise, 5 stars."}
{"text":"Big portions. Good food! Chicken pot pie comes in a huge bowl with sides and a biscuit. Fried chicken is good. Biscuits are awesome and huge. Dessert is huge too. We got one piece of cake for 4 people and still had some left."}
{"text":"I went for the first time tonight for dinner. The service was great and the food came fast and hot. I ordered chicken fried steak, Mac and cheese, and sweet potato casserole...it was good (although a little too much gravy slathered on top of the steak); next time I'll get it on the side. My daughter ordered fried flounder, it was not great. It could have been fried harder and seasoned better; it was, however nice and hot. My mom ordered liver and onions with collards. The liver was good, although had a slight after-taste. The plate was filled mostly with onions and the greens tasted canned. My brother ordered the hamburger steak he said everything was delicious. The baked Mac and cheese was good, the sweet potato casserole was good. I'd definitely go back but may try the fried chicken. Some say the food at Johnny's is better than Cracker Barrel, it runs a close second, although it's definitely better than K&W.  The prices are great. You can get a meal and drink for under $15."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a casual, comfort food place, this is a pretty good restaurant. It's actually a favorite of my parents so I end up here from time to time. I've gotten the grilled tilapia the past couple visits and its quite good. It's perfectly cooked, well seasoned and they don't skimp on the portions. Biscuit was a little bit dry, but the roasted potatoes were good and the green beans were well seasoned. My only real (minor) complaint is that the hushpuppies used to be better before the restaurant changed hands. Different recipe I suppose. All and all worth a visit."}
{"text":"A casual comfort-food place which has given us consistently good food.  Family pricing and quality food explains why you will be waiting on the weekends to get in!  The most we have waited was only about 20 minutes, so no worse than any other place on a weekend.

Have only tried the Bacon Cheese Fries appetizer,  but it is worth every penny.  No soggy fries under this pile!  Shoestring cooked just to crispy and covered in cheese and bacon... You really have to try them!

Entrees are good size and value, and the food is quite good.  The blackened seasoning for the chicken or fish has just the right kick without burning your mouth.   The Hamburger steak is grilled and juicy under a rich brown gravy.   Salads are very fresh and offer several different choices.  Definitely good value for your money here."}
{"text":"The first two visits here were good. The food was good,hot, and the service was great. The last three visits the waitress was not friendly, food was not hot and even had a very bad taste. When I brought it up, she was rude about it and had a atitude. She brought me new food and it was still, cold and not good. The last visit I made I also heard other customers complaint of the same thing."}
{"text":"Good Service and Good Comfort Food

Drove over from Davidson after Church today to give this place a try.  Timing worked out great because the don't open till 11 am on Sundays and we got there shortly after the open.

Walked in and it kind of reminds you of a Cracker Barrel without a gift shop or the China Grove Family House. Lot's of collectibles from years past designed to give a nostalgia effect.

We were seated pretty quickly in a nice booth and our server was there shortly to take our drink order and to present us with our menu's.

I ordered the 1/2 and 1/2 tea and it was still a bit on the sweet side  until I mixed it up and then it worked out.

Menu is very impressive. Both of us love comfort food and this place has plenty of it and a great variety.

I ordered the Fried Chicken with White Gravy, Cucumber Salad and Fried Okra. Chicken was nice and moist with good taste and texture, Cucumber Salad had a good vinegary tang to it. Fried Okra was the only disappointment and that was because it had very little taste or texture.

My wife ordered the open faces Roast Beef Sandwich with gravy and Okra as a side and also a slice of Cheesecake to go at the end.

She loved the Roast Beef Sandwich and portions were so large, she ended up with to go bag for another day.

Good food, Good service and all at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I don't often find myself coming to yelp to review restaurants, however I disliked the food at Johnny's Farm House so much I had to warn others before they decided to eat here. DISCLAIMER: *The service was very friendly and I have nothing against any of the people who were kind enough to serve me while I was here. They are the only reason this place didn't get 1 star from me.* However, the Mac and cheese tasted as if it was made with ballpark nacho cheese (the one that comes in a giant can). The turkey rueben on rye was dry and bland. The slaw on the sandwich was sour and the bread was soggy. Somehow, the sandwich was still dry. Everything was under seasoned. Prices are too high for the low quality of the food served here. McDonald's is a better choice. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times now.  Great variety of food.  My favorite is chicken fried chicken, definitely made from scratch.  Chips are homemade too, but no seasoning and not served hot.  Hubby likes the meatloaf, even though it was a bit dry toward the end of the evening.

Not everything is homemade. Roasted potatos were canned new potatos with oil and seasonings added.  Not crunchy and browned.

Hushpuppys have tiny chunks of jalepenos.  Not overwhelming, but a surprise to me. I dont care much for them.

Food comes out fast, almost too fast when you are trying to eat your salad first."}
{"text":"What an unexpected yummy lunch. Two friends and I were headed to a different restaurant and happened to see Johnny's along the way. Since it was new to us, we decided to try it instead. I decided on the vegetable plate and what a treat. It was like being at Mama's country table. My favorite item was the crispy, crunchy, hot fried okra. The best I have ever had in a restaurant. So good, I ordered a second helping. I would have given 5 stars but the cornbread was doughy and quite a let down in taste and texture. My friends had the ribs and the chicken tenders. Everyone was PLEASED. Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"This place serves large helpings of Southern comfort food.  The dining area is clean and organized.  The service here is tremendous.  They have a special that changes everyday.  I really like the Monday special- Salisbury Steak.  Their sides are really good, too.  If you manage to save room for dessert you will have plenty of choices  on the dessert menu.   Their dinner rolls and biscuits are good.  Their side salad is huge.  I have never left this place disappointed or hungry!"}
{"text":"This is my second time here in 10 days!

The good was so good the first time I had to come back again just to see if it was just by chance, or if this really will be a new hot spot for some good southern comfort food.

First visit....
I had a side salad minus the tomato and onions.  
The Carolina Derby Chicken with Rice and Gravy and Fried Squash.

Second Visit....
I had a side salad minus the tomato and onions.  
\"The Tuesday Dinner Special\"
 Chicken N Dumplings. Roll and a biscuit.

This place could be equivalent to a cracker barrel minus the southern  store, but the food is better with much larger portions and the staff is very friendly.

It is my understanding that they are coming out with a new menu today, so it will be nice to see what has been added.

Remember folks, today's specials are only offered on those days, so don't expect to go in on a Friday and get Chicken N Dumplings, that's a Tuesday's special."}
{"text":"The food was really good. There wasn't a huge wait time for a table or for our food to be served. The seating wasn't the most comfortable but the overall vibe was very down Home country cozy. Very much a southern comfort food must."}
{"text":"Filling out an old seafood building behind northeast medical, Johnny's Farmhouse has some excellent selections, and that's just looking at the menu. When they arrive at the table, most of them are actually better - and that is unusual, as most menu items sound better than they are by they time you actually get them.

The downside is that this place can get busy, and not just at your typical post-church hours, but on the upside, they move quickly since they have a lot of room on the inside, and the staff is friendly and gets things cleared out and updated fast, so you can get to eating some of that tasty food."}
{"text":"Country type cooking. Mac n Cheese was good. Got d variety. Great  piled high tuna melt. Grilled tilapia country fried steak real mashed potatoes meatball subs."}
{"text":"Very impressed with this place been here many times with differant companions we all loved it resently by girl and i went there for sat nite dinner it was booming busy and yet they seated us quickly and the everything was in normal timing for a less busy place this is a winner you can tell it is successful the crew was hopping the place was popping the food is all good with way too much food lol everyone leaves with a box and thats a good sign excellent  place Go Eat Here really
.."}
{"text":"Holy cow! I can't say enough great things about this place. The food was AMAZING. The portions are HUGE. The service was excellent. I am in town on a work trip and if I ever come back to Concord, Johnny's Farm House will be the first place I go. You just simply can't go wrong eating here. I got the Southern fried pork loin, with sweet potato casserole, Mac n cheese, and cornbread."}
