{"text":"They had hair in the food when I asked for a refund after eating half a plate my first plate. I was disgusted, my kids did not want to continue eating there food. they refused to give a refund and said if they were in the same situation they would have continued to eat.igot the run around from the management staff and they refused to give a refund and threatend to call the police. 60 dollars for one plate of food which was not great just a big waste of time and money"}
{"text":"We walked into Lin's Grand Buffet on a Sunday around 2 and there was a line to be seated all the way to the first door (there's the outside door and then a very short corridor with a second door to the waiting area and cashier stand). Thankfully the line moved along fairly quickly and we were able to pay (you pay up front here) and be seated within 15 minutes. I did notice that there was a wait between groups being seated and that there were always open tables with seating available so perhaps during peak times they should staff one or two more hostesses to get it going more quickly.   After getting our drink orders taken, we all scurried to the buffet and explored the fairly well varied selection. I did notice that some of the plates were slightly worn out and that the whole restaurant, including the buffet floor, had worn carpet but the plates were clean and the buffet lines seemed organized so it didn't concern me too much. The sushi was plentiful, but nothing special, with the run of the mill rolls you'd expect everywhere. However, the hot food choices were excellent. The different dishes had distinct flavor as opposed to all being slightly more sweet here, slightly more spicy here heaps of goopy chicken. The beef broccoli was great, no skimping on the beef, the baby octopus was tender and spicy, the stir fried rice noodle was great, and the ribs were tender and delicious. The desert selection was fairly standard with a soft serve machine, fruit, and little cakes and cookies.   If you're looking for a large buffet to load up on tasty Asian food, this is definitely a good place to go. Sushi might let you down a bit if you're an aficionado, but I feel the rest of the buffet definitely makes up for it. For $11.79 an adult on a Sunday (and during dinner during the rest of the week), this is an excellent value."}
{"text":"Ok First of all the food is great ! Until Something Happened.  Ok one evening my mom's friends went out to eat there at the Lin's. One of these ladies served themselves a big plate of ChowMein . After she was half way through the noodles a COCKAROACH camee crawling out the BOTTOM. She told the manager and the manager secretley gave them their money back and shooed them out of there. Ever since CHINESE FOOD Disgusts Me!  This place is just a NO NO ! I wouldnt eat here if it was the last place on earth!"}
{"text":"I saw this buffet while driving to another buffet and decided to stop and take a look. Had the best experience ever. Food was amazing and the waiter was a really good guy. Had a good hibachi. If your ever in Phoenix you've got to stop and check this place out."}
{"text":"Going to this place reminded me why I don't go to these places.  They should change the name of this place to Riff Raff n' Nausea; you get to be around all the rudest, most obnoxious people of S. Phoenix (the other patrons), and the food will likely make you feel terrible. I'm pretty iron-stomached and rarely prone to sickness after eating subpar food, but this place had me breaking out the Pepto, PDQ.  It's just not worth it in any way. BEWARE."}
{"text":"This is my first time eating here. The food was alright, most of the food was salty. The meat i tried was dry and fish was also salty. Fruits such as watermelon wasnt fresh. Carpet kind of smells. If i was to give a better rating, the food should be fresh and done well for that high amount of price."}
{"text":"My British sister visited and as this restaurant is just down the road and we were tired, I took her there on her last evening before leaving. It was after 8:30pm and that might of accounted for some of the scanty selections and missing desserts. What was there was delicious, particularly the ribs and crispy cooked veggies. She enjoyed it and I liked that it did not hugely dent my wallet. I had been there before for lunch enjoying a perfectly cooked plate of garlic shrimp and asparagus, so I'd suggest either catching them for lunch or earlier in the evening for the best selection."}
{"text":"OMG! The ambiance is Walmart or casino food court.  They have a sign posted with the house rules such that list, do not let children run and roam.  It's worse than a public park playground!  Children roaming and running unsupervised, playing in the food and eating from the buffet food tables!  I attended on a Saturday night, the crowd it attracted was surprisingly one that doesn't know how to act in public.  Food scraps all around the floor.  Three children raising havoc in the restroom, I watched three female young adults sitting together have a altercation and one had to beat on another.  This is the crowd this location attracts!  The restaurant staff did nothing to intervene in any situation which they list as inappropriate behavior.  This location is going to need bouncers to supervise the dining room as well as the parking lot.  Not a civil dining experience, it doesn't matter what the food quality is."}
{"text":"This place is gross, bathrooms are nasty, food is nasty, glass was dirty, I actually feel sick... I should have just left and took the loss of my tab. I also actually seen a black guy loading up plastic bags with shrimp and fried chicken. He then proceeded to put the bags in his front pockets. Lol... Do not eat here unless you're desperate."}
{"text":"A disappointment.   Through the end of 2010 I drove by this location while it was being built. It opened late December with a splash by having lights, balloons, and flags. There was no not noticing it had opened.  I figured it can not just be the novelty of the newness of it since the parking lot has been full every day since, there must be something good inside.   The Chinese New Year came and figured what better way to celebrate than to go out for Chinese. So off we drove and decided to skip going to the Chinese Cultural Center that has some great restaurants and stopped by Lin's Grand Buffet.  The entrance greets you with a great chandelier and teenagers at the register.You pre-pay for your meal and, although the place is huge, you may still wait for a table even if there are clean tables. Once you are seated a waiter. waitress in my case, will come by and ask for the type of drink to bring. (Note - They do not have alcohol not even Asian beers.)   There are some great decor items in the seating/tables area, just take a look at some of the snapshots for this place. However, great decor can only go so far towards a good dining experience. One must remember this is a buffet after all and that it is inexpensive. Also the place may be pretty but the floor in the dining area are not kept clean.  Now to the food, which is the main make it or break it part of any restaurant. There are vast arrays of options in hot plates, a sushi area, and a Mongolian  Grill. The hot plates have almost every possible option that you will get from an American-Chinese menu in addition to items that I am assuming are there to fit with the area this restaurant is in; items like enchiladas, French fries, etc. The flavors of those items were ok but not much better than that Panda chain of restaurants. Come to think about it Panda has some better tasting ones. In essence the dishes here are uninspired and nothing new and are what you would expect from a Chinese buffet in Phoenix. The sushi is an item to skip as most people seem to not care for it so those of us who would, end up having dry pieces as they sat waiting to be chosen. Did not try the Mongolian grill area. One additional thing to point out, our drinks were not promptly refreshed.  Bottom line if the reason you go to a restaurant is for pretty decor then this is your place. If the taste of the food itself is more important then forget about this place."}
{"text":"We were told about this place from a coworker, glad we decided to go!  We have lived here a year and have not found a place we can return to for our chinese food cravings....until now.  It was clean and visually appealing.  Great seating, and several food choices including steak and sushi bars.  Even there were tons of food options, I would like to see a few more of my favorites up there.  It cost my husband and I just under $22 for the buffett and drinks with tax.  Not bad, and gets two thumbs up from me."}
{"text":"The best in Phoenix. The area is not so hot, but once you enter, you know you will have great service, and great food, all for a great price. I feel this place is the best for Asian buffet's in Phoenix."}
{"text":"My kids and went there and the waiter brings us our drinks and asks if I need something else and I said we are okay thank you very much , and his response is you thank with your tip, he was very rude and had an attitude . And as we were there he didn't even bother to pickup our plates or give a refill on our drinks ."}
{"text":"Really good value. Two visits with the four of us--no one ever got sick.  Let's face it--we are talking about a Chinese buffet here, so don't expect a \"foodie\" review like we usually give, since all of these Chinese buffets offer the same quick fare. For that reason alone our ratings scale is based upon what college professors would consider to be a \"sliding scale\". Therefore let us continue...  We are awarding 4 stars to Lin's Grand Buffet for some specific surprises:  1.) The fried fish and fried shrimp were very good. Like, SURPRISINGLY good, especially since we are grilled fish/healthy eaters (but the grilled salmon that day was \"fishy\", thus the discovery of the fried stuff). Our suggestion is to try a very tiny piece of fish before proceeding further, since cooking varies from day to day.  2.) The cheese enchiladas are perfect. (Weird, right?) But we were craving them that day.  3.) Yummy \"critters\". Our other surprise was that our 19-year-old stuffed his face with little octopus and LOVED them. He had never had them before, either, and the whole thing started as a dare... He also piled his plate several times with the crayfish. All of it gross to us, but obviously not to him. The octopus are tiny and look like little cartoons. The crayfish are just like I remember them from playing in the creeks of Texas as a child.  There is a HUGE assortment of foods here--something for everybody. Ribs are good, but not too much meat on them, chicken wings are good, pot stickers are good. They've got everything you can imagine and more. Salad bar is a disappointment. Not too many healthy vegetable toppings. Very basic stuff there, including the ever present chocolate pudding.  The husband got two plates of Mongolian Barbecue, so to whoever mentioned previously they don't have this anymore, apparently they do still have this feature of the restaurant. Hubby liked it. Said the first cook \"made it great\" and the second cook (when he went back for seconds) \"made it meh\". Depends on your cook, we guess.  The sushi is uninteresting and dry. Full disclosure, we didn't ask for anything specific to be made for us, so we don't know if that is an option here. Can anyone enlighten us? (Thanks.)  The deserts are dry and monotonous--you know the drill on this stuff.  We refuse to call the soft-serve (which comes in chocolate, vanilla, or swirl) \"ice cream\". It is food-grade \"D\" frozen \"treat\". Nasty stuff, eat at your own risk kind of territory. But again, our son, despite himself and God love him, kept going back for more. Blecht!..and LOL! In our humble opinion, this was the worst part of our  visits.  We've always had great/attentive servers. We say the only drawback is the ripped seating. When we asked for another booth on a busy night the hostess laughed and told us that all of the seats are ripped. So, come on, Phoenix! Let's sit properly, mm'kay? This can be prevented. Otherwise the place is huge and kind of cool/pretty looking. It seems clean enough. Bathrooms are new/clean."}
{"text":"I did a drive by and decided to stop in. Like other people said it was crowded. I decided to wait a while and go back. When I went back it still had a nice crowd so I know the food was fresh.  The interior decoration was standard restaurant. I thought the buffet isles were too close together and it made it difficult for two people to pass each other. (I am not large person)  In addition to the chinese buffet there is also a shushi bar and mongolian BBQ.  I am a chicken eater so I will only review the chicken, veggie dishes and desserts, but I will comment on the presentation.  There was a lady preparing the sushi and the ingredients did not look very fresh. I have had mongolian BBQ and for the life of me I was unable to determine what the meats were. They were mystery meats and I stopped looking before it ruined my appetite.  Now for the standard buffet. Most items were labeled but some were not so choose with care. Hot and sour soup had a nice flavor but I thought it was little salty. The chicken dishes were tasty. I tried the green beans and while they were tasty they were very oily. Lo Mein had a nice flavor, the rice noodle dish was very oily and lacking flavor. The spring rolls tasted like cardboard. Fried rice was mildly seasoned and had some flavor. Sesame chicken and Tso's chicken were very similar in flavor but tasty. Kung Po was very mild. Chicken and broccoli was tasty. The sweet baked deserts were awful and I couldn't really even finish one. The ice cream was ok.  Almost every restaurant has good and bad dishes. This place is no exception. It is standard chinese food and edible. Same type food you get almost everywhere else but all in a single buffet. You can get some tasty food but you not will not like everything. I would go back again as there was enough variety to eat.  Good? Yes. Great? No.."}
{"text":"This is in my neighborhood and we went a couple of times when it first opened. We went back last night and were shocked at the condition of the place. The landscaping is dead or dying and the landscape granite is all over the paths. Worst of all were the state of the booths in the dining area. They have be slashed and ripped to shreds. There wasn't a booth in eyesight that didn't have big holes or gashes in the seat. The booths are surrounded by a decorative white rail - do not look closely at this rail while eating. As well has having a nice layer of dust, the rail is covered in food stains and sticky fingerprints. It might also be wise to keep looking forward so you don't see the state of the carpet. The food was still ok, the waitress who takes the drinks order and removes plates was ok, unlike the attractive but cold and angry cashier who clearly hates her job. We won't be back..it reaks of bad management and is only going to get worse unless big changes are made."}
{"text":"Please please do not come here. Absolutely disgusting restaurant. If you go do not use the restrooms you will lose your appetite. Also when getting food be prepared to fight to get what you want."}
{"text":"Just a typical Asian buffet. The sushi was good. However is was kinda warm. There is a huge selection of food which is great."}
{"text":"Review for Lunch... Chinese food was ok. decent options. Sushi options were VERY LIMITED.. I was disappointed... Love the beignets like dessert...  Services is typical of Chinese Buffet...  Price is reasonable..."}
{"text":"Just what Phoenix needs, another Chinese buffet..  Actually it's a pretty good establishment.  Went there on a weeknight for dinner with my partner.  The prices are cheaper than most buffets but the restaurant itself and food is better than most.  The selection is what you will find in most buffets but they also have steak, sushi and Mongolian grill.  The only complaint we had is that the food wasn't warm enough.  Wait staff/bussers were pretty diligent.  This location just opened recently so it is always busy so be prepared to wait for a seat.  I am not a big fan of Chinese buffets but I will definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"good selection of food, an good price but service was horrible this time, he must be having a bad day, No Tip"}
{"text":"i liked  the food but after a hangover who won't eat anything! great place for hangover not have when sober. great place to people watch that's for sure!"}
{"text":"Wow! What a great place!  Vegas style buffet Blooms in the Desert.  The selection is fantastic, they have 4 different Islands of food with Many trays in each Island  Grilled steaks to order, Sushi, Mongolian BBQ..........you cant go wrong.  For the Price its the best buffet in town. Service has always been excellent and prompt. It always seems to be busy as well.   NO Complaints from me, I have high expectations of places, this is a 5star buffet in comparison to the other options out there in the Valley and for about 11 bucks with tax you cant go wrong."}
{"text":"Food....many excellent items to select. Some items were so-so and others I'd avoid but it's buffet so.....  Ambiance....on the weekend its ridiculously crowded and not even worth going. Has that herd of cattle feeling as you wait in line.   Staff.....could be better.   Verdict....good food that is priced a little too high. On a feed your face weekday it makes for a great choice but avoid the weekends at all costs."}
{"text":"Nasty place is infested with roaches!!!!!! A lady and I were standing by the steam table when a big roach crawled out of the food! I told the manager and they quickly  gave me a refund to keep me quiet  and leave before I put them on blast! I asked him  if they were aware they have roaches and he said \"yes,but we have an exterminator  here every week\" that is disgusting and they need to be ashamed to be open. I guess they think only greedy fat people will not care that they are eating in filth smh..."}
{"text":"Service is horrible, cashier is very rude, and one register open with 30 people in line, no management on duty for lunch rush on a Friday afternoon. Priced well. Food was okay, I've had much better, we will never return. I don't recommend."}
{"text":"Usually I'm not a fan of Chinese buffets but after a disappointing buffet acurance else where decided to give this place a try and I enjoyed it. Lots of food and atmosphere wasn't bad either. I would most likely go here again if I got the chance."}
{"text":"when you have twenty open tables you should seat people. I know being in charge of seating is a very heady position , but you not so important. get over yourself."}
{"text":"Yelp had it all wrong with 4 half stars?!!! I had wanted a buffet chinese setting for quite some time. After work on evening I had to try and see what the food/setting was like. After walking in that evening, I had decided that maybe it wasn't a good idea after all. The bathrooms were filthy and the music way too loud. After cruising the buffet for something common in a chinese buffet, nothing except the sushi was just ok. The food wasnt hot and the dinner plates were no where to be found. I kept asking where the plates were and a manager pointed in one little pile. There seemed to be many people eating that evening and I thought too myself what couldnt be wrong with this grand buffet? The crunchy fried shrimp was the only thing i had too go back for seconds for. Nothing else seemed to satisfy or crave my buffet eyes. The environment was loud and service just ok. Furthermore when I craved some desert, only few choices were available. The choice were old  and had been sitting there for while. I wouldnt go back to this place and wouldnt tell anyone to try. Just another chinese buffet went wrong."}
{"text":"Lins has decent food and a good selection. They never seem to run out of any of the items even when they are busy."}
{"text":"lins is honestly the most amazing buffet ever !! maybe if you guys stop being disgusting and making a mess it wouldnt be so dirty ! the food is great and for a very reasonable price ! :)"}
{"text":"I have been here several times during lunch. Good food selection and not bad for the price. Service is good. As far as buffets go, this is one of the better ones I have been to. I would recommend."}
{"text":"Unlike most buffets, the food here is consistently fresh.  Included in the great variety of options are simple sauteed mushrooms, terriyaki chicken on a stick, or chicken poppers. From the simple dishes to the more elaborate, each and everything we have tried is tasty and delicious. Higher priced than we normally pay,  but considering the quality, an excellent value and worth every penny."}
{"text":"This is one of the better Chinese buffet restaurants out there.  The food was very good and very fresh and they do a pretty good job of keeping everything clean.  Even during the Friday night rush.  My only complaint is that they need to lower the temperature.  It's way too hot with all of the  people there.  By the way, if you're looking to try something a little out of the ordinary, try the baby octopus.  I thought it was quite good."}
{"text":"extremely good value, ton and tons of selection of food. They have sushi, steak, mongolian grill, salad bar, and endless amounts of chinese food. everything tasted fantastic and the servers were great. constantly refilled my drinks and took the plates away. 10/10 would come back again"}
{"text":"A lot of food to choose from, almost too much!  It's been kind of a hit and miss with certain foods being hot, over done, or out to long.  But, all in all, the prices are good, the food is awesome, \"although they did say they use MSG\".  We go here about once a month to get our \"fix\" and can't say we leave hungry at all.  Although I've had better, this place does try it's hardest to make ya' happy with they selection of food, that's for sure!"}
{"text":"For a buffet, it's pretty good. Most asian places tend to have bland food with the texture of wet cardboard. This is a few steps above that. Only complaint is the price is a bit more than average."}
{"text":"**Please note that while I am giving them 4 four stars, I feel that many other people would feel like my experience should be a 3 star review**  First of all, you need to remember that buffets generally tend to be kind of poor quality. With that in mind, I feel like the food at Lin's is above average compared to other buffets. This is good because I would say that Lin's is about $3-5 more expensive than other similar buffets. A two person meal with drinks and tax came to $28.00.   While the food was of good quality, there were a TON of chicken options. I point this out because if someone doesn't like chicken they may not enjoy their experience. I personally feel that there were enough non-chicken items (which were also of good quality) to make this issue relatively minor. For non chicken choices, there were: many types of fruit, several types of spring rolls, a FEW beef/pork options, a good selection of seafood (shrimp, salmon, octopus, and sushi).   The dessert choices were probably the most disappointing aspect of the food there. There were several types of pudding, jello, fruit, pastries, cookies, brownies, and soft serve ice cream. While this may seem not seem too terrible, I do have several complaints. First, the brownies were horrible tasting. I am by no means picky, but I feel like a box of store brand brownies that were burned badly would have tasted better. There was simply no flavor whatsoever! The selection of pastries was meager and the pastries were not all that good (very simple, small ones) and they tasted rather mediocre. I have the same complaint with the cookies. All I could see were plain old-sugar cookies! Furthermore, it didn't look like they had run out of cookies, it looked like that was all they had!   The service was acceptable, I'd give it a 3.5 rating. While it was not as attentive as I'd like it to be, it did seem better than what other people have described! Otherwise, the staff was polite, friendly, and helpful.   The actual facilities are quite nice for a buffet, very clean well-lit, and organized. Although I did notice several booths had holes in the cushions, the majority of the furniture/fixings seemed to be in excellent repair: clean and relatively new!  While I'd recommend this buffet to other people, I'd let them know that most of the main dishes available are chicken dishes and that the dessert options might not be to their satisfaction."}
{"text":"Nice, clean restaurant.  Did lunch here.  Long line to get in.  Food options were wonderful.  Food flavor was ok. Great price for lunch.  10 per adult including drink. Strange how they mixed dessert items among the regular main dish items but heck, part of the buffet alore is just searching out different types of foods to try.  Must admit, for a Chinese buffet it was very good and I would go back."}
{"text":"Flies all over the food in the buffet and the manager was rude when we asked for a refund!! Nasty!!"}
{"text":"I used to like this place. Quality of food is not good and not much variety anymore. Very limited desserts. There were no Crab legs! I will not come back. It's sad because this is very close to my house. I might just take a nice long drive in search for better food!"}
{"text":"I never thought I would actually use this account to review, but I didn't think I would try squid either.  This place has got to be the worst place I have ever eaten in my entire life. Everything was bad about this place. The food there is minimal and none of it looks good. There is even chicken nuggets and French fires... Really?  that's just how the food looks. As soon as I started eating, I can tell something wasn't right. I tried the squid, worst idea ever. Even the ice cream sucked.  As soon as we were done, we walk out, and one person from the group we went with threw up right in front of the store... Uh-oh.  We stopped for gas, went to the bathroom, and I threw everything up. Which I haven't done in about 6 years. It's sad cause the food at the gas station would probably have been better than that \"food\" at the buffet.   So after spending $12 for food I threw back up in a gas station's bathroom, I rate this place a 1 star. Wish I could give it a -5 star."}
{"text":"Good food, good service.  Mongolian grill is one of my favorites.  Prices seem a little steep for a lunch but overall it was very good.  I'd go back."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good Bathrooms need attention, no paper towels.  No one there looks very happy? Front counter to check in was sort of grouchy.  Brooms, dustpan and cleaner laid up against children highchair wasn't very pleasing to the eye, made me wonder if they were this lazy in the food handling?"}
{"text":"This was not one of the best Asian style restaurants in town.  Keep in mind I said style because Asian buffets do not normally include enchiladas and beef soup also known as caldo de res. Anyway, most of the people there were Hispanic so I assume they are catering to their guests.  The best I could say about some of the food was that it tasted okay.  There was nothing to be desired or make me want to go back for more.  This was the first buffet that served me a burnt Mongolian dish.  Most of the food was not labeled.  Since I have eaten at several Asian restaurants it was not difficult to navigate through the dishes.  There was a problem with the cleanliness of the bathroom.  Also, there seemed to be broken drawers underneath some of the food, which exposed the pipes underneath.  I was concerned that roaches may start their own buffet.  Some of the people there did not know where the ketchup was.  I found it in the salad section and it was definitely not Heinz!  The price of $37.00 for lunch on a Saturday was okay but i would expect more from a buffet.  The only icecream they had is actually frozen yogurt and it came out partially melted. The pizza was generic.  This was the first place that ruined chinese donuts for me.  It is kind of hard to mess those up but this place did.  Good Luck and remember you don't have to take me word for it!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants being in our area. Alot of people do not really use the back of the restaurant where you can make your own grilled meal, its amazingly good . Which is something I always go for. Secondly you could ask the chef for some steaks which are very good as well. Some of the employees have been there from the start. The sushi is good as well the buffet itself has many options. And when you have desert you can always ask for some coffee."}
{"text":"when you go there ...watch out for the lady changing the fruit and salad station.  They wear gloves, BUT, handles cleaning rag, then puts her same hands back in the food.  NASTY and contaminating."}
{"text":"WAY OVERRATED....It is HUGE but I found a hair in my food and I have been burping up what I did eat all day...It was $45.00 plus tip for 2 adults and 2 children....I WILL NEVER GO BACK!"}
{"text":"Is a good place to eat if you like Chinese food not very fancy but it's a decent meal little pricey for what you get still decent place"}
{"text":"My boyfriend went to here and threw up a few hours later because of the salmon sushi that he ate. He said that a piece had black on it, which is a sign of already rotten blood. This was probably the result of toxins in the fish, time-temperature abuse, or cross contamination."}
{"text":"The customer service from the hostesses is lacking. They don't smile, act very unhappy to see you walk in the door, and when we waited 15 minutes for our drinks and had to go ask them about them, they wanted to blame another guy on the floor in front of me instead of just fixing the problem. You can be as polite as you want to these girls and they show no good character to you, not even a \"your welcome\" . I like the place, but the customer service just from the two hostesses I had to meet for the second time coming here makes me want to find another place to eat. The other staff running around were all really great at getting us refilled and taken care of and the  food is pretty good with a lot of selection,but those two hostesses.....smh."}
{"text":"I went here two days ago with my sister and we had a good first experience service was good almost all the food we tried was good tried 13 different Chinese dishes and only one of them was just okay I'll definitely be going here again probably the best Chinese buffet I've had so far up here"}
{"text":"I've given Lin's Buffet 2 visits before I decided to write a review. By no means is the restaurant terrible, I was just a bit undecided on how much I like this place. I know for sure that they are consistent with being inconsistent.   On my first visit, I would rate the cleanliness a 7 out of 10. However, today their rating would be a 10 and this was during their morning rush.   Our server kept forgetting things such as a booster seat, refills on sodas and napkins but I'm very forgiving of these things because I too was once a server... I know the headaches a worrisome customer can bring.   The selection of food is above average and very fresh. But to me, what sets this place apart from the mass is the Mongolian Grill section. The grill master was very friendly and made my order the way I wanted. Now, please keep in mind that if you are a Stir-Fry buff like me, so far NO PLACE in the Valley beats Hong Kong Buffet in Ahwatukee on Chandler Blvd.   All in all, this place is worth another visit. Now, please excuse me... I must get back to my diet!"}
{"text":"Beyond disgusting. Food was cold. And old. If you like eating bad leftovers that have been reheated time and time again, you will love this place. Restaurant was filthy. And while we were there the manager actually turned away a party of 5 because they wanted to sit at an 8 top. The restaurant was 3/4 empty and this was Friday night at 6:30. Save yourself and never come here. Can I give it less than 1 star?"}
{"text":"Yes its true one should not have extremely high expectations for buffet style restaurants however...this one is just.... blah. Some stuff was kinda good but everything else was just blah...I tried the Mongolian grill and it was kinda gross not much flavor. Out of all the Chinese food buffets I've been to this one definitely ranks towards the bottom. Oh, but the interior decor is cool :)"}
{"text":"Great Buffet, a lot of food to choose from, clean, friendly and drinks were filled promptly. So good ate there twice in a week. Definitely recommend"}

{"text":"Love the food.The service desk people are nice and friendly.Waiters are better then the waitress, If you ask me.The cook during the day sucks but the food after 4 o clock is delicious.There always busy, which i love that because that's how you know there food is yummy.For 2 people i pay 23.84 which is including tax with out a drink which isn't bad to be honest.They always put out fresh food."}
{"text":"i went on tuesday to eat with my family for my birthday. the place is beautiful. the food was decent, however it wasnt special. they did have a ton of dishes available. there were a few glitches. empty trays, i waited for 5 minutes to get some lo mein. no noodles for the mongolian bbq. i waited for 10 minutes and they didnt replenish the noodles, so i moved on. the service was bad. the girl that was waiting on us never came to replenish the drinks, and we had empty plates on the table for over a half an hour. the manager made eye contact with me but never came over to offer assistance, or even an excuse. i will say that the manager was pitching in helping clear plates of empty tables. so after spending 55.00 i dont think i will go back. i will try another place."}
{"text":"I visited this place hesitantly, 11/2013, due to the reviews stating it had gone downhill and was pretty dirty. after scoping out the restrooms (washed hands), it didn't seem as bad, seeing that I have been to restaurants in 3rd world countries as well as hole in the walls in the USA. BUT BUYER BEWARE!!!!!! DO NOT GO HERE!!!!! I and my friend got SEVERE food poisoning (and I am sure many others that day). Nausea, muscle weakness, the inability to focus and thus work and diarreahh and the whole 9 yards For your own health's sake, do not come here!!!! It is not worth it!!!  I am vegetarian so I didn't even eat any meat and still got food poisoning. this is how unsanitary this place is!  I will be reporting them to the AZ health board. I am from CA and am not sure how this place is still running as I read someone else had gotten food poisoning as well... maybe the health standards in as are just not as strict in AZ. this place needs to be shut down!!!  I have never had food poisoning from eating out!  as a side note, the plates were dirty. also, despite the food tasting decent and the building construction being neat, don't let that fool you as it did to me!!"}
{"text":"I was contemplating going there, so I called their phone number as listed. Rang over 25 times. Then a Hispanic lady with thick accent answered the phone \"Lins\". I asked her how much Saturday dinner was; $14 per person. First impressions are a lasting impression. I am not going to spend a bunch of gas and money for the 2 of us to eat after this poor first impression. I will go during the week at lunch and tell the owner about the phone call experience."}
{"text":"$9.39 adult lunch after tax, water to drink. Lots of items, especially fresh fruit and desserts. Baked salmon, good amounts of crisp kiddie food, enchiliadas, char-siu pork ribs (yummm!), crawdads, shrimp in shell as well as battered, a sushi area (Americanized, no sashimi, but still good), Mongolian BBQ area, and a lot of the usual Chinese buffet items. Mussels 2 different ways! This is not a place for being in a hurry, but you CAN get the to-go styro.  You want to enjoy this. Service is very courteous and very fast with taking your plates and refilling your water while you're getting the next plate. Someone give that blond dude a raise for his friendliness and professionalism. Absolutely no complaints about this place whatsoever, and price is right on and fair. I don't have a bad thing to say about this place, the broccoli was nice and bright, and everything was perfectly presented. I would've given 4 stars but service and the INSIDE SKINNY below puts it to 5 stars. INSIDE SKINNY: The Thai chiles in the General Tso's chicken and other dishes. What you want are the plump and darker ones moist with juice from the dish, not the flat harder ones. They're roasty in flavor and sweet, and not too hot. Well for me anyway! I love that flavor! The seeds seem to have escaped so you don't have to worry too much about those. Even if there are seeds, and there usually are, a good chomping (chew thoroughy please) is great with a few bites. HAWAIIAN INSIDE SKINNY: ONO CHAR SIU RIBS! ALSO: To go styro is $4.99 a pound. STYRO STRATEGY INSIDE SKINNY: Half inch layer of rice on the bottom to keep the juices from your other selections. A little chow mein goes well with the Thai chiles as well. Since you're being weighed out at the end, try to maximize your meat and be diverse with your selections. A little of everything is a treat. Try not to get veggies weighed down with juice, remember it's by the pound. I also like the green beans. My reasonably filled styro with mostly meat and some veggies and a little chow mein came to $9.18 but if you cram it the price can get up to $12.50. Watch out for bones, you'll pay for them by weight, but the chicken wings (regular and mildly hot but delicious) are a good grab. I get 3 per styro.  Great to dash in and out to take back and eat at your desk throughout the day."}
{"text":"We love it! Good variety, ribs are delicious and fried fish has a tasty batter. Sushi and Chinese standards are great.   If it wasn't so far from Surprise we'd be there at minimum once a week."}
{"text":"Food overall was good, especially for a buffet...wasn't impressed with the sushi, service was not very good."}
{"text":"Well, the all you can eat dinner special is excellent in taste. But,, after eating the filet steaks off the grill, and 1 plate of enchiladas, I became really ill with food poisoning. So, about 6 hours later, I kneeled down before the porcelain goddess and gave her all that I had 8 times in a 36 hour period of time. Bad fever and stomach pains. My other issue is that Lin's is anti-gun and is right in the middle of the ghetto at 75th and McDowell. They have signage posted basically advertising that it's a great spot for those that have criminal intent. First time and last in there. I will not be supporting a restaurant that wants to infringe on my rights to be able to adequately defend myself from violent criminals. Like I said, it's in da' hood and not good."}
{"text":"Had lunch with 35 of my closest friends today. The restaurant was very packed but we were still seated very quickly. There was a large selection of food. It all seemed very fresh. There was a continuous stream of employees replacing food or replenishing food at the buffet. I had no problem getting a new drink (I had 4 iced teas...). Employees were constantly clearing the table and making sure all was well. I only had one complaint.... lets just say the men's room was dirrrrty. Other than that good food, fair price."}
{"text":"Dined here just this past Saturday evening and well let's just say that this place has officially managed to restore my faith in buffets.  Typically I'd never go to a buffet, reflecting on that \"tried one, tried em' all\" mantra.  NOT THE CASE HERE^^^^!  My family totally peer pressured us into accompanying them to Lin's Grand Buffet and admittedly after the 4-5 hour drive out from So Cal, ....we were seeing mirages and envisioning Flintstone sized T-bone steaks appearing upon the side of the road...  Walked into this place and GOOD GRAVY!!! I became vague and delusional from all of the food choices. There was a bit of a wait but it expired as we simultaneously paid upfront for the meal. Shortly thereafter we were seated and then it went down like four flat tires!!!  Picture Ontario Mills Mall (if you're in Southern California) or the Minnesota \"Mall of America\". There's absolutely no way upon visiting you could ever fathom conquering each and every store within a one day visit.  That was my sentiment here. I felt DEFEATED.  From the salad bar complete with mussels and shrimp....down to the orange chicken, soups, teriyaki steak....then over to the Mongolian station which sits adjacent a steak preparer, whereas you can request your cut of steak and have it prepared to your liking.  This place has EVERRRRYTHING!!!!!   Seriously. Californians are getting so reamed....paying more for less. Nothing in So Cal has come close to this place well unless the name is followed by \"casino\" and even then, you're paying twice as much accompanied by the cost of parking.  Hands down, I would definitely be willing to travel completely out of my way to come back here. I had 5 plates of food (and provided a star for each plate, lol) and left stuffed yet ....I still don't feel remotely as if I came close to sampling everything.  This place is the TRUTH!"}
{"text":"Lots of food made fresh. Hate the cattle herd feeling to get seated and the general feeling of being overwhelmed with boards of people eating like there's no tomorrow (myself included). Prices are good and the place is very large, so the waits are pretty short, if you like this kind of vibe. I don't think I'll be back. Going to stick to Panda Express or my favorite authentic Chinese restaurant, Great Wall. Sometimes, less is more!"}
{"text":"Didn't make it past the cashier. She was talking to her boyfriend on the phone and acted like we were bothering her so i complained about the poor service and left."}
{"text":"Not such a great place... Someone posted this on Facebook from their experience at this location and found a roach in their food!  Gross...  https://www.facebook.com/Jfashionn/videos/925495004184770/"}
{"text":"I thought that this place was pretty great! Rand H. another great Yelper had recommended it,so I always wanted to try it. I came here with a friend to celebrate her Birthday early (crazy Schedules we have.) Anyway ,the first thing I noticed about this place is how absolutely Beautiful it is! Honestly,it has 2 of the most beautiful Chandeliers. The place is done in some gorgeous tile,and some beautiful statues as well. The food is fresh and a lot of great selections. They even have a Mongolian Chef,as well as a Sushi Chef. All very good. I wish they brought a tea pot with hot tea. But instead they bring you a foam cup with a straw and lid. But, my friend got Ice Tea and she got a glass with a straw. I thought that procedure was a little odd.  Lots of parking outside, and the service was good. He kept coming to check on us.  The Bathrooms however, could use a little attention. But, all in all, the place was beautiful and the food was great."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, it was clean, spacious and had great decor.  Ive eaten at a few buffets, and this has to be the cleanest one ive been to.  Food was good, hot and fresh. Lunch was around $10 plus drink.  Defenitely a buffet to visit and enjoy with the family.   Mon - Fri before 4pm around $10 Sat - Sun Dinner after 4pm, around $13"}
{"text":"I've driven past this place a few times since it's just down the street, so I finally decided to stop in with a friend for dinner.  I could tell they were still in their 'grand opening' phase, because the place was completely packed.  When we stepped in, there were about 10 people in line ahead of us, but fortunately, the line moved very quick and we were seated immediately after we paid (~$11/person).  I also saw people order a buffet take-out.  You get a styrofoam container and fill the contents with whatever is out on the buffet floor.  I think they charge you by the pound.  The selection was vast, with the majority of dishes being Chinese-ish.  They have a sushi bar, but the selection looked very limited.  They also have mongolian bbq, which I saw many people line up for.  One guy had a plate stacked up so laughably high that I was amazed it hadn't fallen over a few times.  I spent most of my time at the made-to-order steak station.  The steaks aren't very thick at all, but they're good enough for what you're paying for.  The service was great.  Our waitress kept our waters full, and had no problems with us lingering around afterwards to chit chat.  When we got up to leave, she and the hostesses at the front gave their thanks for coming in.  Lin's Grand Buffet is a decent place for lunch/dinner if you're hungry and in the mood for a Chinese buffet complete with mongolian bbq, sushi and steaks."}
{"text":"So I decided to give this place a shot for lunch since eveyone who I know that has gone rants n raves about how good it is, well they are right!!! Its in a funky area off 40th St and Baseline but the cleanliness and freshness of the food was amazing...and so much to choose from. I typically DO NOT like ANY buffets but this one is exceptionally good and they will be seeing me back along with more friends:) A+++++"}
{"text":"Food is good, waitress was friendly and kind. Dessert is like every other chinese buffet, why so- I have no idea but it's definitely in need of an overhaul. Hostess/Cashier was rude and cold as the inside of a rocky mountain tumbler!"}
{"text":"You couldn't pay me to go back to this place.  I've eaten at another Lin's location, and it was pretty good.  This one, however, was DISGUSTING!  The food was terrible...literally nothing the four of us ate was even passable as food, with the exception of the pizza, which my 15 year old said was \"ok\".  My kids used the men's bathroom, and they were horrified by the kitchen smoke in there, which was so thick they could barely see...what they could see, however, was gang graffiti all over the walls and foul language on the bathroom stall doors.  The tables were dirty, the servers were useless (we ended up just filling our own water glasses repeatedly and removing our own plates from the table).  I've been to plenty of buffets around the country, and this was by far the most awful experience my family has had, from the food to the lack of cleanliness to the nonexistent service."}
{"text":"First the food is mediocre at best and the service was terrible. What more can one say but go somewhere else, this place may have a lot of options but not worth the price at all."}
{"text":"Good food. I would come back just for the hot and sour soup. What a sinus cleanser"}
{"text":"food quality has gone down since i was last here, service is poor, lots of children running unattended and out of control all over the buffet.. used to be able to ignore such things because the food was good, but definitely wasn't worth it this time round, very disappointing."}
{"text":"convenient location  parking lot was packed and there was minimal wait inside  spacious and did not feel claustrophobic with the high ceilings  selections were good - could have had a bit more...  overall quality good   do recommend  reasonably priced  interesting to hear mariachi music in a Chinese restaurant!!"}
{"text":"it's a Lins buffet. There were copious amounts of Chinese dishes, salad, fruit, soft serve etc. Nothing to write home about but also not offensive. For the $ it was A-OK."}
{"text":"I eat here once in a while and the food is always decent. Sushi is good but Pacific is definitely better. They have lots of fried fish and shrimp that my friends and I like and the Chinese food is good. They always have some fresh fruit and they have soft serve ice cream for dessert. I'll keep coming here when I'm nearby and in the mood for buffet."}
{"text":"There's always room in my life for a buffet. I must say my experience was much better than I expected it to be. The restaurant itself was very clean. We were quickly seated at noon on a Saturday. I was with a party of 12, they only allow you to put two tables together so if your party is more than 8 you will be split up. The food stations were clean as well, everything looked picture perfect. There was a Mongolian Stir Fry Station, Sushi Station, & \"Bakery\" (notice he italics). I sampled several chicken items and some shrimp entrees. The chicken entrees were good but they all tasted the same so whether you get General Tso's, Broccolli and Chicken, or Cashew Chicken it's all basically the same flavor- SOY. I liked the soft served ice cream, it beats having little kids try to scoop out their own ice cream like a lot of other Chinese style buffets do. I was brave and tried the Baby Octopus, the sauce was great but it was so chewy that my jaw literally started to hurt from munching so much. Didn't get to try the American food items but I definitely will have to go back and try before I write this place off. The biggest plus was the cute waiter that constantly kept our  cups full."}
{"text":"I know I said I wasn't a fan of your standard Chinese buffet, but this one isn't what I'd call standard.  I'd call it pretty freaking good.  If you go on the weekend, be prepared for a wait.  The crowd is pretty typical for a buffet, complete with your big families with their packs of feral children.  But during the week its less chaos--not always a better crowd but fewer of them. I was impressed with the quality of the food.  They had several dishes that I went back for seconds on, not just stuff that looked like it had less chance of making me sick than the other stuff.  The fried fish, of all things, was a stand out hit.  The kung pao and General Tso chicken were good too.  Usually anything breaded is to be avoided, it usually has tree rings from being re-battered and refried for recycling on the buffet.  I didn't find any of that here.  The veggie dishes were fresh and crispy, not cooked to death.  In fact, anything that I thought looked like it'd been sitting too long was replaced with fresh by the time I went up again.  Now, the Mongolian style fix your own was lacking in that they used their pre made sauces instead of what you mix yourself.  And the sushi didn't look like anything I was willing to risk.  Other than those minor issues, it was very good.  I would go back and eat there again, just not on a weekend!"}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would. The service was fine and we were seated in a decent amount of time.  But when it came to the food, it was so disgusting and the only good thing on the menu is the chicken that's on the skewer because it actually tasted fresh. Tried to give everything a fair chance with the salad to the fried rice and even pizza. The pizza itself was doughy and not even cooked all the way through. I ended up sick once I got home due to the under cooked and under whelming food. We were really hoping for a solid review because it's a close place that would be convenient but this is clearly not a place to go to for solid, food especially food that is edible."}
{"text":"The Mongolian food here is the best I've tried anywhere in town, but the restrooms are just horrible. Tagging all over and just not well maintained. Customer service isn't the best either. The conditions of the place I'd rate as a 2.5, but the quality and taste of the Mongolian food bumps it to a 3"}
{"text":"Though they have a variety of food their wasn't alot i liked. The Sushi Was good though it was all rolls. My 8 year old is very picky and didn't like the food and only ate a small amount. I was disappointed since alot of reviews said it had great food."}
{"text":"I cant believe Lin's is only averaging two and a half stars . Well they might not be five star they are close , they have a lot of good food choices clean , comfortable ,well decorated , friendly polite staff and a reasonable price. That is enough right there to say yay i am a fan. So if you like a good Chinese buffet let me recommend Lins Grand Buffet it is a very good buffet and you will see for yourself."}
{"text":"Lins is a one of my favorite Chinese buffets, there is lots of good food plus sushi,mongolian and bakery counter,When ever i have been there I always leave stuffed and happy with the food I stuffed myself with.They have a large selection of trays and they are not all 5 star but a lot of them are very good,so I just fill up on the ones  i really like. So if you are looking for a good Chinese buffet Lins is worth checking out.            s"}
{"text":"This place was the definition of sub-par. Boring food, generic selection, packed and noisy, with pop music(American) playing over the speakers.  First of all, the omissions: no dumplings, no dumpling sauce, no gyoza sauce, no sweet-and-sour sauce/sweet-and-sour chicken, no sesame balls filled with red bean paste, etc  As for what they *did* have? The sesame chicken was tough and overcooked, the egg rolls were disgusting and inedible, and the Kung pao chicken was no where near spicy.  The best that can be said of them was that their cream cheese wontons were good and the service was wonderfully attentive.  Definitely never returning."}
{"text":"What a rip-off!  They charged us for a beverage when we didn't even want it.  And seriously, $5.99 for a beverage?  I know it's a buffet, but that's like highway robbery.  I think I will go somewhere nice next time."}
{"text":"This is a family restaurant buffet thats serves quanity over quality so the food is average but it is fulfilling."}
{"text":"Ight check it, I'm about to put 90% of the female workers who work on the floor into check.  Just because you are pretty ,cute, instagram famous,facebook famous,get 100+ views on snapchat doesn't mean that you have to talk to customers/approach them with a stuck up attitude. Not everyone who walks in is there for you and to admire your beauty because the world revolves around you. Some people,like me, just want to enjoy a nice dinner ight.  I walked in Cashier:just one?  Me:high good evening, how are you doing today?  Why do I have more manners then the employees?   I paid my fee to get in and was asked to stand on the side and wait to be seated by a bus girl, so I stand and wait and I see some bus girl approaching me, I say \"hi how is it going?\" And the girl  grabes a fork but no knife and just nods her head to follow her ...tf?  I guarantee you that if I was in need of a job and I applied here I will end up taking both of those females job. There are just up in the front for being pretty,I rather have an ugly girl or a guy attend me who will do an awesome job vs a stuck up young pretty female who will do a horrible job.  The only reason I am giving this place a 2 star instead of 1 is because the other bus girl who kept picking up my plates and refilling my drink was actually very kind. I wish I would've gotten her name but she was covering the center front tables on Friday night around 8pm sept 9. She looks Hispanic and had highlights or light brown hair I believe.  I asked her if she shares tips with everyone or is he keeps them and she said she keeps them. I said good. I don't want anyone else getting my money as a gratitude for their hard work."}
{"text":"Before coming here I had read several yelp reviews about this buffet so I had some information on what to expect. The hostesses at the front seemed preoccupied with conversation between each other, but for the most part they were pleasant and professional. Our waitress made sure to clean our plates from our table and refill our waters often. My girlfriend and I tried the sushi to start. The sushi was at a good cool temperature but all the varieties tasted pretty similar. We tried one of each to taste and hadn't returned to sushi the rest of the dinner. We are both sushi fanatics and didn't find a whole lot of appeal with what was available. Next, we wanted to try Mongolian bbq. We walked to the station and examined the meats and vegetables to choose from but for the amount of time we stood there we were never helped. There was no chef or employee standing by so we left, after some short time, and looked at the actual buffet tables. There is so much variety!! We ended up trying a little bit of everything and after fourteen plates of food we figured out what we really enjoyed.  My girlfriend loved the salt and pepper shrimp and fried chicken. I really enjoyed the cream cheese wontons (which were all room temp), and the chicken kebab. Most of the other food was good, especially with the variety, but foods like orange chicken, broccoli and beef, and other popular dishes were fatty in texture. My girlfriend tried one of the soups and stopped eating it after one spoonful. She told me it had an awful 'something' to it. She also tried the crayfish and one of them was very dark grey/green on the inside. Near the end we tried the (randomly placed) desserts. Everything from the marshmallow peach (pineapple?) salad, to the icecream, and the cakes. The bundt cakes looked good but we didnt try them. The cakes made in house were pretty dry. My girlfriend ended up eating the cream cake topping on top. They had two doughnut selections. One was definitely hostess doughnuts, that you could buy at Walmart (lol) and were really dry, and the other was this really delicious sugared doughnut. We ended up opening the doughnut and pouring vanilla ice cream inside, and it was soo good!! It was a cheat day so I (accidently) had five of these morsels. All-in-all it was a good experience. The buffet was good but there was definitely a taste or wow factor missing from the food. Besides our waitress, there also appeared to be a \"I don't want to be here\" attitude with the front and back of house staff. Lastly, we arrived around 4:30 for an early dinner. It wasn't busy until about 6:30 when a line started at the front."}
{"text":"First off.  Phoenix is obsessed with chinese buffets.  I mean seriously obsessed.  Everywhere you look there is one.   Second years ago I personally vowed not to ever go to one again because the food is soo low quality at a chinese buffet you are just better off going and paying 5 bucks for made to order food.  So anyway after about 15 trips to homedepot across the street I saw this enormous building always packed to the brim with people.  I was like damn this place must be seriously good to have a hour wait for a phoenix buffet.  So I talked Carlos Sr. into checking it out.  And I broke my years of no Chinese buffets.  This place is not bad, but not great. The Sushi sucks.  Below grocery store quality.  They have a steak bar that serves low quality grilled steaks.  Mongolian bbq made to order.  Typical dessert and of course random Chinese hot plate to choose from.  And a very so-so salad bar. The bathroom was so filled with graffiti I barely could find the sink or toliet.  Seriously worst graffiti I have ever seen in a bathroom in my life folks.  Worse than LA by far.  But considering this place is only a few miles from Carl Hayden High School (the poorest neighborhood on the west coast of the united states) trust me it is folks I am in real estate, this can be expected I guess. Anyway.  The food was not bad.  But 10 bucks for dinner.  You would have to be really really hungry to fork out that kind of money.  Also 10 bucks without drink.  So it comes to more with a soda.  Seriously.  There are better alternatives out there for a bang for a buck.  later CJ"}
{"text":"I have long since thought that Lin's Buffet was the pinnacle of Chinese buffets. I have, and still would give its sister restaurant in Albuquerque 5 stars, however this must be the runt of the family. I seriously thought I was in for a good time, but I was quickly shown that I wasn't. My wifes Mongolian grill entree was burned, the sushi was warm, and most of the entrees were a mix of sogginess and saltiness. Dont get me wrong. I am usually a point and eat kinda guy, this was just harder."}
{"text":"The resturtant was great. they have some many different oppitions to choose from. the staff that work for this resturant are very friendly. They do not mind helping you out when when ask for something eles. The food that was at this location was great. Salad was at the cooling temputure. The hot food was at warmth temputure. That fixture hanging from the roof, when you enter is marvilous. The overall enviorment was very clean and inspection ready. My overalll experience with this location of ( Lin's Grand Buffet) was great. NO PROBLEMS at all. Will consider making recomindations."}
{"text":"Great Chinese place to eat and good prices. Korean noodles are the best there."}
{"text":"I went for a lunch buffet on a weekday. On par w/ Pacific buffet, but nothing incredibly special. I'll be back there for dinner.  Nice and clean though"}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying I try to avoid buffets at all costs. I want to lose about 20 pounds and when you put \"free\" food in front of me I will eat it (yes, I know that technically I paid for it but once paid there's an unlimited supply). It's a wonder I'm not as big as a house.  Having said that, my friend and I went there for lunch and were both shocked, first at the number of choices and at how good everything tasted. I was stoked to see the Mongolian buffet. Eating at a Mongolian restaurant typically costs at least as much as we paid to eat here, but I still have so many more different kinds of food to eat.   I'm too lazy to name everything that I had and rate it, but I will say that I was surprised at how good the items like Buffalo wings and enchiladas were (at a Chinese food restaurant?). They of course had many of the Chinese buffet staples and they also tasted great.   I really don't understand the low rating. We paid $7.99 for lunch and I don't know what more people are asking for. To have an unlimited amount of food to eat with this many food choices that are each really good on their own? I give it 5 stars because I can't imagine getting more for my lunch dollar than this.   In fact, just writing about it has inspired us to go right now.   PS: Please close this place immediately so that I don't go there too often. I have tightly bolstered car seats and I hate it when I can feel my \"love handles\" rubbing."}
{"text":"They need to start firing everyone up in this bitch. All young and lazy ass kids are working here... service is all kind of effed up... food is very dry.. soda came from a effin pitcher and it was very stale...... im done...."}
{"text":"Some many of my friends have raved about this place and how great it is. It is obvious how different out taste buds ARE!   So to start the year off my employer decided to take all of us out to eat at Lin's Buffet.  How nice.  The gesture that is.  I normally hate, loathe, buffets because I don't want my food sitting out with people picking over it. Not cool.  Well, yeah, that's just it.   First, if you are gluten free or have any other diet restriction...STAY AWAY!  This place has very little to offer for you to eat.  I basically had veggies, fruit, and hard boiled eggs.  Second, I went to the bathroom when I first arrived, and there was NO SOAP. WTF. Strike one and two.  I quickly thought about how many people use the bathroom and probably didn't wash I was I appealed. After I used my pink to open the door I luckily found a colleague who had wipes or hand sanitizer.    All in all mediocre food. Extremely crowded. Non dietary restriction friendly. Smh.  I'm just glad I didn't have to pay."}
{"text":"Just tried this place out yesterday as I've been looking for a good Chinese buffet in the area. I just moved here a few months ago and wanted to compare it to places back home. I'm giving a solid 3 stars.  This is probably the largest Chinese buffet I've been to. You pay upfront, so our lunch for 2 cost just over $22 with drinks, not including tip. Did not have to wait to be seated since they were on the ball about that. We were served our drinks right away and headed to the food. Our waitress was friendly. She came to our table about 3 times during our meal (for each refill we had on our drinks).    My favorite selection was definitely the jalapeno chicken. It was way spicier than I had assumed it would be, so it was a pleasant surprise. I loved it. It definitely blew the other chicken out of the water. Most of the others I tried were somewhat bland. Not much flavor at all really. I've had better general tso's at most other places. The sesame chicken tasted just like the general tso's. Not much flavor. The kung pao chicken probably had even less flavor than the general tso's chicken.  I'm not a fan of sushi so I can't comment on Lin's sushi without saying I didn't like it. I don't like seafood in general. Though, the salmon they served was actually something I enjoyed.   The beef from beef and broccoli was okay. It was a little TOO tender, but some may enjoy it falling apart right away. I just like chewing my food instead of being able to just mush it down and swallow it. But not many complaints there.. The only other complaint I really have about the food was some of it was room temperature or cooler. But some was also very warm as they had just brought some out right before I grabbed it.   They have various fruits set out in the dessert section, but the melon wasn't completely ripe so it was a little hard still. Also, it wasn't very cold. I like cold watermelon, and it was warmer than room temperature so I was a little disappointed. The pudding was cold and the ice cream was fine.   I rate it 3 stars simply for the jalapeno chicken and friendly wait staff. Being seated quickly and the waitress keeping up on our refills. Other than that, it was pretty mediocre. I've been to way better Chinese buffets back home in Illinois, so it's nothing too special for my taste buds."}
{"text":"i prefer buffets to a la carte restaurants, and i love lin's! their price is out of this world given the variety of food. and the locals know it's a bargain, because every time i come, the entire parking lot is packed around noon, and you see cars circling for a space. because of the amount of patrons, the food is fresh. (i think lin's usually opens at 11:00, so if you come then, you can avoid the parking hassle).  i usually just skip the rice and load my plates with fresh salad and the meat dishes. everything's is yummy, and the taste of each dish, while not top notch, is distinct from each other.  my favorite is the sweet bbq pork ribs. and i usually leave some room for their fresh baked cookies and ice cream.  the staff is also very friendly and respectful.  thanks lin's! don't change!"}
{"text":"This is actually the worst buffet I have ever been too. More than half the food does not look edible. I asked the waiter for duck sauce and he does not know what that is. AT A CHINESE RESTAURANT. Cheap but not worth your 10$."}
{"text":"Lin's is your basic run of the mill Chinese buffet maybe even a touch better. They are 3 stars because they are worth another visit."}
{"text":"The food (the choices \"I\" had) were good - typical buffet. The woman (forgot to get her name) waiting on us was really attentive to our needs, thank you.  BUT, as with any restaurants (plural), \"THEY MUST KEEP THE RESTROOMS CLEAN AT ALL TIMES\".  I'll update here next time I visit."}
{"text":"I've been here two times and have mixed feelings. The food is good, but my biggest complaint is the hostesses! They all seem like very young girls, and so incredibly rude! No customer service manners at all, constant eye rolling and acting like everyone they had to seat was a bother."}
{"text":"This place sucks.  Period.  I'm a big fan of buffet, and frankly this place is what makes people hate buffets.  Never again."}
{"text":"Ok so never again will i go to this buffet, this is the kind of place that will just make you sick when you think of buffets or chinese food. The food looked old, the shrimp was de veined, the salad bowl had enough water in it to fill a pitcher, it took 20 mins to get me my drink (selection was very small as well). When i walked up to the sushi station, the person who was supposed to be running the sushi station was crouched and was very will hidden while eating food ( he looked like smeagel) super sanitary right. If you what you hear go for it ! To the rest beware , this place is really gross and im sure therre have been people who have been sick."}
{"text":"This buffet is just ok. For a Chinese buffet it's the best one I have been to yet, though I don't frequent many Chinese buffets. To me most of the chicken items taste very similar to one another. I have only had the lunch items so I can't speak of the dinner menu, I can say that if you want a ton of food for cheap, Lin's is for you!!"}
{"text":"Eh. I don't even have much to say. This was a Chinese buffet, and it tasted like one. The sushi was unlabeled, which was a shame. Service was lacking--it took quite a while to get drink refills. The mei fun and vegetarian delight were both fairly good, but I'd avoid the meat if at all possible. All the meat."}
{"text":"The restaurant is always busy with customers and the wait is long but the wait is worth it. We come here most the time. We love it! The buffet offers Sushi, Mongolian stir-fry and they would cook your steak on your liking. The buffet itself has a large choices of desserts, salad and of course Chinese food. A great place to bring friends and family from out of town and enjoy eating together."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this buffet.  It is affordable and minus the salad, the food is always fresh.  (but come on, who comes to a chinese buffet for the salad LOL)   The sushi is always fresh, and doesn't taste too fishy.   The fried rice is amazing!   The wait staff is okay... it's a buffet, so it's easy for drinks to run dry.   Also, they're fortune cookies are actually GOOD. Usually they are stale, but they must go through a lot, because they are usually fresh.   All in all, we visit this place quite often, it's clean, consistent and always enjoyable."}
{"text":"Hubby, son (11 yrs old), and I went here today. We have been to a similar establishment about a mile from it a few times, but wanted to give Lin's a try. So very sorry we did.   These were our issues, not neccesarily in order: The sushi looked as though it was leftover from previous days, rice hard, vegetable pieces inside were brown. Service workers had dirty hands/fingernails. When hubby was at the grill where you get together what you would like them to grill up for you, the worker drenched the utensil (that patrons are to use to pick up raw fish) with raw fish and its water. Food was not great, not even good.  We managed to find a few items that tasted ok, but it was definitely not worth the $43 we paid. And my stomach is upset as I write this, I feel nauseated."}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is always fresh, the restaurant is clean, and the staff is nice. For a buffet place it is good."}
{"text":"There were so many options and the Food was great and fresh. Good service at a decent price."}
{"text":"After a visit to the Audubon Center in South Phoenix (everyone should visit this nature center - it's a great educational experience; OK, enough of the plug) and following a hot tip from Rand H., my mentor in the fine art of buffet appreciation, I went to this newly-opened restaurant for a late lunch. It's an impressive buffet establishment - spanking new, very spacious, lots of seating, more than ample parking. There is a large array of dishes from the main self-serve area, plus a Mongolian grill & steak area as well as a sushi counter - though the array of sushi is a bit limited here. The dishes are typical of super buffets and are very well-prepared. There is a large staff very efficiently attending to the large crowd. The South Mountain community finally has a good buffet in the area - good for them! And good for me, as I'm frequently in area too!"}
{"text":"****ROACHES***** is all I am saying. I have eaten at Lins in the past and really enjoyed the food. I went today for the first time in about 6 months and it was the worst experience I have ever had at a resturant. It was dirty (not being judgemental-because only God can judge us) but the people look like they just climbed from under a bridge and didn't shower or comb there hair but just showed up to eat, the bathroom was filthy the toilet paper dispenser was broken, the sink was broken, a lady was walking around wiping her nose and grabbing plates.....I could go on an on about this place, but to top it off there was a ROACH crawling on the wall above us....Now that is just GROSS!!!!  My suggestion for the owner is to shut the place down for a month fumigate the place, clean it up and raise the prices so that they can weed out the people that are collecting money on the side of the freeway.  All money is not good money - I'm just saying!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best buffets in Arizona, I would compare it to some casinos. It is new and modern, the layout is good not like the old dirty buffets you see most places that are outdated. The food selection is better then most buffets too, I still have not tried it all yet. Big parking lot which gets packed, the place is fairly large too and is its own building. I recommend it for family,friends or you can just be a pig and go by yourself, haha."}
{"text":"Typical, middle-of-the-road, nothing special, nothing too awful Chinese buffet.  Went here once with my brother, nephew, and dad a couple of weeks after it was opened.  Between the four of us, we pretty much sampled most of the food there - and nothing really wowed any of us.  For the price of the buffet, 99 times out of 100, I would probably rather go up the street to Panda Express."}
{"text":"3 stars is laughable... This place makes the best chinese food in Phoenix and its a buffet which is the crazy part, don't listen to the reviews foods PHENOMENAL!!"}
{"text":"Good food, huge buffet one of the biggest around but a little bland to appeal to everyone. There is also a Mongolian grill inside and sushi.   The sushi was not very good though go somewhere else if your a big sushi fan"}
{"text":"First time here . Great food , beautiful interior !  Price was pretty awesome too ! Loving it !"}
{"text":"No flavor at all nothing tastes like it should. Looks good tastes terrible. And the lady in the back that makes the Mongolian has anger issues lol yells non stop hurt her finger \"god dam going to chop those fingers off!\" The way she preps the food is very unsanitary hand on ground pan falls down picks it up no hand washing after all this lol disaster. Now I know why u pay first.    Came hungry left kinda disgusted...."}
{"text":"We have been here numerous times, even for Easter day, and have left happy every time. The food selection is huge and 95% has been tasty in my opinion. My partner is big on sushi and loves theirs, as well as the squid & crayfish. I go more traditional and love the steak, shrimp, sugar donuts, veggies, and much more. The buffet is regularly filled, and the chefs at the steak & Mongolian area are great, as well as funny. Wait staff are good too. For what is offered, it is definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"Food is really good, Sushi is fresh. Ribs, Shrimp, Chicken wings, Clams, even Steak....lots of options....great price."}
{"text":"For a nominal fee of $9.00, one gets to eat like Kings here.  In fact, the spread of food here got me worried that the meat I was eating is not really meat (???).  On top the a larger than usual buffet offerings, there is Mongolian BBQ available as a choice (included in price).  Although not a buffet fan, I have to say this place knows how to get people to come back.  In fact, if there's a Lin's Grand Buffet open near a Genghis Khan, I know which one will be going out of business soon.  This is certainly a MOAB (Mother Of All Buffets).  So if you're 16 years old, run 20 miles a day, and has the metabolism of a racing cheetah, enjoy.  All others, watch what and how much you eat when you come here as it is easy to overdo it."}
{"text":"My daughter loves this place, and I've never been, so I took her here as a reward for a good report card. As soon as I pay and we are seated I hit the bathroom. As soon as I step in to the men's room I'm hit with the scent of stale urine and the sight of graffiti reminiscent of a gas station bathroom. After I'm done with my business I notice neither of the soap dispensers have soap in them. They were so bone dry it looked like they hadn't been filled in weeks. I told one of the servers after I got out of the bathroom and used some hand sanitizer I carry with me. While I filled my plate the only thing I could think of was the chefs who cooked the food who hadn't used soap to was their hands and all those before me that had grabbed the serving tongs. After I sat down with my daughter to eat I glanced over towards the servers area just in time to see one of the servers in plain view shoving his finger in his mouth to pick something out of his back teeth and then grab someone's drinks to bring them to a table. Needless to say I was disgusted. The only reason this place gets 1 star is because the little food I did manage to stomach was okay, but I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Went back after 1.5 years and still the same.  Subpar food.  High prices.  Got there when they opened and it was $30 for 2 people for lunch without tip.  We decided we will not ever return"}
{"text":"This eating place had a wide variety of foods to choose from. Scrumptious and delicious. Many types of chicken, seafood, veggies....not bad. If you're hungry and like seconds or even thirds then this is da place!"}
{"text":"Not bad for a buffet - I'm not generally a fan of buffets, because most of the ones I've visited favor quantity over quality. Most of it's pretty good, except for the baby octopus."}
{"text":"For a Chinese buffet....this is as good as it gets. The place is huge and is always packed. If you don't want to wait in line then go on an off hour or day. People have mentioned that the floor is dirty...but that's because there are so many people here at any given time (families with kids that drop food, etc) that its hard to keep up. I was never skeeved by the lack of cleanliness. Yes they do have a pan of hundreds of baby octopus which is kind of repulsive to me, but coincidentally they are my boyfriend's favorite. I just try not to look at his plate. And yes, the egg rolls are horrible, but luckily you have about a gazillion other things to choose from. Chinese spareribs, chicken on a skewer, sweet and sour chicken, soups...I have these as appetizers and by the time I'm done I'm too full to eat much of anything else. But I have sampled the main course dishes and they were all very good. They also have a Mongolian grill so you can choose your ingredients and have them cook it up for you. There are also steaks and a sushi bar too...all included. I would be surprised if you can't find something you love here."}
{"text":"We LOVE Lin's, effin A Lin's. This is, by far, the best Chinese buffet in Phoenix. We look forward to going to Lin's and will go multiple times a week. We are offended by the negative blasphemous comments. If you have a negative view of Lin's, you don't know Lin's. Clearly. We love Lins... I could say it all day. We will be requesting tshirts next time we go. Haters not welcome."}
{"text":"I am giving Lin's 4 stars as a 4 star buffet, not a 4 star restaurant because I think there is a big difference.  It's not cheap but a decent value. We paid $52 for 4 adults for Sunday dinner, including 3 fountain drinks. Although it was busy when we got there around 5:30, there was no wait. When we left at 6:15 the lobby was full of people waiting to be seated. The place is very pretty and feels a bit like a Vegas buffet. We were seated upstairs, which was nice as we were further from the noise and chaos from the lower level where the food is.  The selection of foods is huge. I had a small piece of steak cooked to order and it was very thin but tender and had good flavor. The boys had several different pieces of sushi and said they were \"alright.\" My favorite surprise was the fried sweet bananas.  I am sure we will be back and make this a regular go-to place when we can't agree on what we want."}
{"text":"Carpet is dirty with trash and food stains.  Sorry but tonight is the first and last time i am going here.  Still looking for a great asian buffet spot in phoenix, i might try Jasmine tokyo in scottsdale next"}
{"text":"We checked this place out because it was recommended from a friend. We saw the buffet right away by its red lights with its distinct pagoda like structures. Not bad for less than $15 for a dinner that serves seafood like sushi and steak along with a Mongolian grill. Our server Saul was great at refilling our drinks and even getting us A1 sauce for the steaks. But moving on now to the nitty gritty review... The chow mein noodles were over cooked and lacked salt. The salmon was too salty, I had to drink my soda to get the taste out of my mouth. There were two coworkers canoodling by the dishwasher area as we can see by where we were sitting (a blonde girl and a Mexican guy), they later disappeared after what seemed like 10 minutes to the back away from their coworkers who, were cheering this couple on instead of letting them know to keep their professionalism on point! Now that was a huge disappointment!!! Like how can management let that happen?! I didn't mind that the Chinese ladies who didn't speak English bumped me and my purse fell to the floor without apologizing but how disgusting is that? The professionalism was out the window on this one. I hope these two workers are reprimanded for their awful behaviors! We are not coming back to this business again."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for sushi and this place was on Yelp under \"cheap sushi\" and had good reviews, so I tried it.  I was not impressed. For being more than $10 a person I expected better food and better environment.    There were many empty tables but they still made us wait in the lobby to be seated for several minutes along with others who'd already been waiting a while.  Not sure what the delay was about. For the record, even when we were walking out there were still people having to wait despite even more empty tables.  I was excited to be seated by the sushi window, thinking this will be great! But when I got my plate most of the sushi was gone. There were only 2 kinds available and the lady making it kind of scowled at me like I was the devil himself.  I took a few pieces and decided to eat off the rest of the buffet while I waited for her to make some other type of sushi.  There were a lot of people there with children, it was louder than I'd expected and had lots of food on the floor in the seating area because of all the children.  Our waitress was doing her best to keep up with the messes and clearing the tables, but she had a tough time.  She did take good care of our table though.  She brought refills on our drinks before we needed them and cleared the extra plates.  She was working hard.  I've been to places like this and loved the sushi, so I was optimistic about finding great food.  Tasted everthing that looked appealing from the buffet and the sushi and bakery windows as well as the dessert bar.  I did not try the mongolian BBQ window.  Of what I did taste, the food wasn't that great.  I will not be going back.  There has to be better Chinese buffets.  Will post when I find them."}
{"text":"the regular chinese food is the same as anyother place.the mongolian grill is what sets it apart from all the other places."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I am not a fan of buffets.  However, we were excited to try this place when it opened.  We went on a Sunday night before 5pm.  When you walk in you must pay for your food right away.  Then you wait to be seated.    We waited over 20 minutes.  The restaurant is busy with a high turnover and the carpets were dirty with food scraps.  The food is all sub par.  Not good at all.  For sushi I tried a roll with cream cheese and a sliver of green pepper.  Yuck!  I tried the chow mein noodles- Yuck!  Panda Express is about 100% better.  Tried the sweet sugar roll and it was stale- Yuck!  The cream cheese wanton had an old grease taste.- Yuck!  In fact the only thing edible was the broccolli and the bananas in a red sauce.  A total waste of $45 for our family to eat there.  My husband and I agreed to never go back.  That being said my 12 year old son loved it.... go figure."}
{"text":"Mike C, Rand H. and myself were amongst the hungry folks waiting in line at opening time. We were quickly greeted and seated by one of their friendly hostesses.        I had hot and sour soup, wanton soup and a side of the crispy crunchy accoutrements for starters. I had a sampler plate of the various Chinese buffet staples all of which were fresh and tasty. Then I put together my own Mongolian BBQ conundrum and watched as the chef cooked it to perfection. The desserts were standard Chinese buffet fare. As  Mike C. said, \" If you're looking for good Chinese buffet Lin's is worth checking out."}
{"text":"This place is decent, considering the fact that it is a Chinese buffet. I like to come here on Sundays after church with the family. Some will like it, and some won't. Come down and give it a try."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place a few months back, and have been a few times. We drive from Tempe (by ASU) to Lin's about once a month and feel the long drive is worth it. I love the Sushi here. There is always someone behind the counter making it fresh, so I watch to see what has just been put out. The \"regular\" Chinese food is ok. I have had better, but for a buffet, and less than $10/person it is good. It is interesting to look around because there is alot of unusual dishes that I am not as familiar with. Have seen lots of different octopus items. So, if you like unusual Chinese cuisine this is the place for you. There is a pizza bar, french fries, and chicken nuggets if your kids don't eat Chinese food. There is also a Mongolian grill, and a steak grill. Both of which I have not tried but plan on trying the Mongolian grill the next time I go.   I have heard the lunch buffet is tastier than the dinner, but I have not been there for lunch.   I noticed the floors were not very clean, and there were dishes on empty booths that had not been picked up. But, the buffets are very clean and I always see a worker bringing in new food or cleaning up spills. It is a large building and very crowded. So there is alot of noise. The bathrooms are very tidy and kept up well."}
{"text":"Hostess and waitress were both incredibly rude.  While we were paying, the waitress was digging through the lost and found and interrupted the cashier to ask if she could have some sunglasses...  I wasn't impressed with anything I tried on the buffet, so we tried the Mongolian Grill. It was good, but the selection was limited.  The chef was super friendly though and made us laugh.  The waitress did make sure our drinks stayed full.  However, every time we told her thank you, she reply with a very unenthusiastic \"yea\"."}
{"text":"So I went today, Wednesday at 1:30 or so. I was expecting a small run down place with like 6 people in it.   The sign for Lin's is large, and the building is as well. It's not your average ghetto Chinese buffett. It's big.  There were about 100 people there. (I didn't look at the pictures before I went.)  I was very curious...   So..   Three long buffet counters that have hot food, one that has cold, a sushi bar, and a mongolian barbeque.   Impressive...   So why one star?  The food was barely edible. This is definately an example of America's love affair with quantity over quality.   The good-  Large Selection Egg Roll- edible- barely Bread roll- normal american- good Chinese Spare Ribs- decent Cool entry way and building Service was attentive  The Bad: Sweet and Sour Chicken Seasame Chicken Spring Rolls (how can they mess this up??? - I couldn't eat them! I've had frozen ones that were bettter.) Shrimp and Chicken dish Rice Noodles Fish Lo Mein  I don't trust sushi at $8 buffets, and I don't like Mongolian, so these may be the two items everyone raves about, but what I had was flat out gross.  So I'm pretty hungry.. and I start trying a little of eveything. All of it was gross. But I'm like- this got a lot of 5 star ratings on Yelp, maybe the next thing will be good. No, that was nasty too, maybe the next?   So I way over ate trying to find the food y'all were saying is worth 4 or 5 stars.  If I was six years old, I would be so happy that I could get chicken nuggets, and pizza, and onion rings, and french fries, and egg rolls, and pudding, and ice cream. But I'm not 6- and this food was gross.   For buffet I'd much rather go to China Garden on 19th and Bell. That has 1 row of hot food, but it's delicious. I'd even rather go to Mike Kwans Golden Coin - and that has a 1 star yelp rating.   Did I mention that the food was gross?"}
{"text":"I always enjoy a good Chinese buffet - there's usually a good selection of the kinds of food I like - namely meat. And there's plenty to go around here. Unfortunately, none of it was really that noteworthy.  There's a huge selection, including sushi and a Mongolian grill, along with a dessert row. I focused on the basics - fried rice and lo mein, and various meats such as sweet and sour chicken, sesame chicken, kung pao chicken, general's chicken, teriyaki chicken, buffalo wings, pepper steak, and barbecue spareribs. None of it was bad, but there was really nothing special about any of it.  It's a nice place, and it might be worth checking out a second time to try the Mongolian grill to see how it compares to places like YC's, but I'm not really in a hurry to go back. There are plenty of smaller Chinese buffets out there."}
{"text":"This place was terrible it was dirty and the food was not fresh. Golden corral is 10x bettee"}
{"text":"Buffets are buffets. It is either a hit or miss. And when I had dinner here, it was pretty good. Food was on point and was quickly refilled when a tray was empty. The steaks were awesome, not too dry and not too bloody. The dessert bar is no Wicked Spoon at the Cosmopolitan, but the chocolate cake was definitely good.  Did not try the sushi bar, so no comment there. But everything else was good. I really enjoyed the noodle, baby octopus and orange chicken. I know, really basic. Ahahaha.   I was skeptical because of all the reviews I have read. But hey, I would have to try it out myself to see if it was good or not. Until next time.  Happy Buffeting!!"}
{"text":"Yes they finally took down all the no gun signs.. I guess they realized people weren't paying attention to um anyway.   The food is usually good, but apparently Friday afternoons SUCK. No sea food, everything was fried. The hostess is so slow it's like she is a pot head or something.. the cashier is also SUPER slow.. tables everywhere but we have to wait while they snail along."}
{"text":"Went for lunch at 11:15 am. Everything was cold on the buffet.  I ask the waitress for the manager and she said he would be right over. Never showed up. $50 for 4 people to have lunch and not being able to eat it was ridiculous. This place use to be good.  I will dispute my credit card and never return."}
{"text":"Live a few blocks from Lins for years. It was great the first 6 months,  then it began to go down hill. Went there a few weeks ago and it is horrible.  Buffet food cold, and tasted like it was left over from the day before. Service was also bad. I ask to speak to the manager and he or she never came. It will close in another year."}
{"text":"Our experience started with the credit card machine stopping mid-transaction and my card charged 3 times! When I pointed this out to the manager she said it didn't really go through and wouldn't do a refund or a canceling transaction. Then the Cook in the Mongolian Grill area ignore you like if you were invisible and the excuse of another employee is that the cook does not speak English...I just heard her speaking perfect English! The he sarcastically wishes me to enjoy my meal. Update: went today with cred account showing all 3 transactions were paid but their response was that the problem was with my cred card and they would not refund  my money."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best chinese buffets I've been to. They have a lot of options, the food is always hot and tastes good, plus it's not too expensive.  The only issues I have are the floors are always messy and it disgusts me when the servers sweep the floors, please start using a cordless vacuum!  The deserts are out of a box and aren't very impressive.   Also, It would be nice to see more non-meat entrees on the buffet."}
{"text":"I've been here a million times. Usually I just go for lunch w one friend. This time I went with my family to celebrate my mom & sisters birthday. We were a party of 12. 3 of us were there first & asked for a table for 12. They told us they would not prepare a table until everyone was there. Once we were all there they took us to 2 separate tables for 6. That defeats a purpose of a family dinner doesn't it? I said \"We don't want to sit separate.\" She seemed very bothered & said she would try to find a table for 12. I felt like it was very irresponsible that they would be so unprepared even after we warned them about our party of 12. Eventually we did get a table & the food was great."}
{"text":"I live less than a mile away from here and can see the red neon lights at night from my house.  This restaurant is generally packed around dinner, so if you go there in the evening expect a wait.  The price I guess is okay.  The food could be better.  It's basic Americanized Chinese in the buffet tables.  They also have Mongolian barbecue set up in the back but I haven't tried it.  I usually get some sushi which is located next to the barbecue.  Generally I prefer a non buffet Chinese place because the food is usually better, but we do go there sometimes for convenience."}
{"text":"I've never been a fan of Chinese buffets and this place did little to change my mind on that. I was hoping to be wrong as we were greeted by a 30 minute wait for a table. Heck, this many people can't be wrong? Ummmmm...  Standard Chinese buffet food but nothing imaginative or inspiring about this one. It was a nice touch to see a steak cooking station but I had to order it 3 times before I actually got mine and it still wasn't cooked right.   All in all, I guess it's what I expected for a cheap Chinese food buffet but I won't be going back again."}
{"text":"Decent enough food for a buffet. It's about average. I would have said it was top notch except that I found another buffet in town that has the same offerings at a higher quality."}
{"text":"Everything was a mess. The plates the salt and pepper shakers were all gross. The baked potato was covered in dirt then cooked. Great almost 30$ (for two) for nothing. I had to ask for a fork because there was none in there place. The inside is a huge mess. Ugh what a waste."}
{"text":"Have been here several times,  good food several choices, good for lunch and dinner. Soups, slats, sides, main dishes, desserts and sushi.  I always go for sticky buns, hot wings, sour soup.  Waitress always nice."}
{"text":"Absolute worst customer experience and dining experience in my life. I found a hair in my fried rice and when we called the manager over to see it she argued and refused to give us a refund because the hair came from a \"customer.\" Trust me I understand hair in your food unfortunately happens however it was the way the situation was handled. I don't care who the hair belonged to like the manager tried arguing with me over. I care it was in my food and ruined my appetite. Very disappointed considering we brought a skeptical friend with us and swore it was \"our favorite Chinese buffet.\" Safe to say we will never be eating here again. My one regret is that I didn't take a picture before they took my plate away."}
{"text":"So we have been wanting to try this place since before it opened and finally tried it tonight.  Never again!  It is decently priced for buffets but doesn't come with a drink...and then you get the food and start to think that it is now overpriced.  The green beans were hard, the spring rolls were bland, as were the pork eggrolls and most of the food.  My daughter LOVES rice and noodles and after one bite wouldn't touch the white rice or lo mein noodles again.  The \"salmon\" nigiri was like plastic and the rice in the sushi wasn't good either...later found out that it is the same rice for the buffet and sushi.  Broccoli in the veggie delight and the beef n broccoli was pretty good but the beef was really fatty and chewy and the mongolian beef lacked.  They have both hot and cold mussels, the cold ones drip a lot of water and come frozen and just get put out and the hot ones come frozen and get heated a bit, both are chewy.  Popcorn shrimp has very dry breading, chicken nuggets and fries couldn't have been to good since again my daughter only had one bite of those.  Out of the soups the only decent one was the egg drop soup.  Even the mushrooms were kinda meh,  it's like they took a random brown sauce and threw some button mushrooms  in it without doing anything else.  It's like everything comes in frozen but they don't even get their food from a good supplier.  The baked sweet potatoes were really but they don't have brown sugar to put on them.  And Tim was our server person/glorified busser, and he did a great job and was friendly...plus, we spoke with a manager and he was really nice but didn't seem like he has a firm grasp on everything and more make excuses like sundays being crazy days for them and that was why the floor was so dirty and covered with food and trash, and he did say that they are building more and already have some in other cities and states and that they all use the same recipes, so BEWARE.  Lastly my guy will eat just about anything and even some of the most disgusting things and doesn't have issues with it and before we left he was already running to the bathroom"}
{"text":"I love this buffet. It is very clean and there is a great selection. I love this place for a team lunch during work time. It's close to the office, quick, and easy. They are very accommodating for a big group. I have 10 people on my team. They all loved it and had a blast. I think the best part of coming here is that you don't have to wait. You get your food right away and there is more time to socialize.   I will definitely bring my team here again for lunch."}
{"text":"Not Bad  Today, my co-worker and I had a craving for a Chinese Buffet, after some discussion, we were off to Lin's Grand Buffet. As we arrived there was a long line to get into the restaurant, mainly because you have to pay first. However, we were seated promptly. The staff at Lin's are very friendly, and our server brought our drinks to the table right away.   The food at Lin's, is fair.  Lin's  offers a large selection of entrée's  including cooked to order mongolian grill, as well as seafood, baked salmon, octopus, various beef & chicken dishes, and  BBQ ribs. Lin's also has a salad bar with several salads, jello, pudding & fruits.  Lin's does  not have a drink station where you can get your own water, soda, tea or coffee. However, servers are quick to  refill your beverage.  The service at Lin's is good. The wait staff were quick to take away dirty plates and refill beverages.  Lin's is not one of my favorite Buffet spots, but you could do worse in a pinch."}
{"text":"I hate giving a 1 star. I would've given them 5 stars because they have a huge variety of choices for food and a good few desert choices, but when my husband, 1 month old, & mom went out to dinner there last night, towards the end of our visit there, a cockroach as big as a locust that had climbed on to my leg & for the longest time I couldn't figure it out until I looked down and I saw it crawling around all over my leg."}
{"text":"OMG! our first time here  the food was great everything was fresh and warm. The price is very reasonable as well  most definitely be coming back SOON"}
{"text":"We came here for a special occasion, the food was good. It was hot and well stocked. Everything looked fresh (except for the whole salmon). Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. Only minused one star because (for a buffett) I feel like it's so expensive to come here."}
{"text":"I was there on a Sunday, it seemed really busy but wait time was not awful for my family of four, 5 minutes at the most. The place is big and the decoration is on point, waiters are nice and check on you often. There could be more selection as far as the food choices, they have a hibachi grill and they cook your steak anyway you want it, they also have a sushi bar. I have seen smaller placer with far better food choices. The reason this place is getting four stars is because the area where you get to get your food is too small and gets crowded to easily, you have to wait for people to finish getting their food to be able to get yours, that makes it awful awkward. Other than that price is reasonable and the environment is very family friendly."}
{"text":"You think when you see this building it is the grand daddy of all buffets. Well looks are deceiving! The place was crowded and you barely had any room to sit or walk.  The food is just the same as any other buffet, had the same items only there was a section with steak.  I was disappointed that it was no different then the regular buffets you go to. I did not like how the tables were all meshed together, I understand being popular but the customers should be comfortable.  The price is the usual cost you see in buffets, but I wouldn't call them grand cause they weren't.  Nothing spectacular don't get your hopes up."}
{"text":"We arrived at 8:54 and they told us they were closed when it clearly stated on their door that the hours were from 11-9:30. We asked and they said there was nothing they could do to seat us even though it was dead. I would give 0 stars if possible."}
{"text":"Lin's is an okay experience, but there are better Asian buffets out there!  They have a lot of dishes that you'd find at a Panda Express, but they are really oily and the taste isn't that great.  You can also find some other selections like soups, salad, fried creatures, chicken wings, a sushi bar, a Mongolian BBQ-style area, and some fruit and puddings.  I was a bit disappointed with the sushi selection as most rolls had minimal Ahi and avocado.  Compared to other buffets in the area with a similar price range, they are also missing snow crab legs and some more dishes with shrimp.  I also found the hostesses to be overly mechanical rather than genuinely hospitable.  The price for adults is $10.59/ person on the evenings AND weekends (i.e. even during lunch), and $8.29 during the week.  I posted a picture of the prices for reference as there wasn't one.  The quality isn't that great, but it does the job.  In all, again, Lin's was an okay experience, but not as \"grand\" as the restaurant name implies."}
{"text":"Absolutely Horrible Experience!!!  On July 10 my family dined here, I regret it and won't return.  Their exhaust system in the kitchen broke and the entire dining room was full of exhaust smoke.  It is a health hazard to breath that and it is a fire hazard also.  Their women's restroom was disgusting.  Garbage overflowing, no toilet paper or paper towels.  I have ate here several times but won't return after this visit.  I wasted $35 on a un-enjoyable experience.  The owner was present that night, He should have had the integrity of a business owner to close for the night."}
{"text":"1. Great food and selection. (For a buffet). 2. South Phoenix (my negative point) 3. Awesome looking dessert (was too full to try)"}
{"text":"Massive place, lots of people, a lot of food and a lots of choices. It would be hard not to find something you like for the entire family. Not sure it's the most healthy things you could eat. Lots of calories in the meal I picked. You could choose from some of the other items that might be better. They have a grill and fresh sushi. It's worth a shot. I was glad I stopped in."}
{"text":"Place was pretty great, i like the theme and show of the place, i guess thats what attracted my attention. Food was great, got served quickly, and i just had positive thoughts about the place."}
{"text":"Me & my family goes to Lin's pretty often at least 1 every 2/3 weeks. Yesterday the most distinguishing thing happened, their food is always good and fresh doesn't matter what time of the day you go is the reason for us being frequent flyers. But yesterday we went in for dinner and as soon as my husband sat down on the table w/ his food ....... Roaches ....... like a battalion of then not kidding ... 6/8 came out all on in a sudden and the first one walked over his food....he stood up and spoke w/ management but this is ridiculous ...... I mean if you can see 1 you know there gutta be more but seeing 6/8 at a time .............. omg and we just walked out ......... never going back in there again.. Good bye Lin's ......... all those ppl please watch out this place are ripping us w/ higher value but they do not maintain their business."}
{"text":"Great layout of food. Incredible variety. Very clean. Quality of food was great. Staff was welcoming and service was good. Wasn't your typical Chinese buffet in terms of quality. They have put a lot of effort and energy into keeping the food looking and tasting good as well as the layout and design of the building. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. If you go on a weeknight dinner it's nice and quiet. The weekends are packed but we still get seated pretty quickly.  The sushi definitely need a some work though.  The food overall is always very tasty."}
{"text":"My partner and I pull in and the lights weren't on. Once we get inside, the lady in the front ignored us and didn't say anything. We get seated and the food was decent this time. The waitress took forever to get our refills like roughly 10 minutes. We see another waitress on her phone in customer sights. While we were waiting for our refills, we got the hostess to get our drinks and she put my soda in my partners tea glass and his in my glass... not even in new glasses."}
{"text":"Very rub n lazy stuff. They couldn't have any tables ready for a birthday surprise party"}
{"text":"Food was eh.  The bathrooms were dirty and chairs falling apart.  It has gone downhill fast since it opened.  Probably won't be going back.    Side note which really isn't the restaurant's fault, parents watch your kids around the buffet here. I have seen kids touching the food with their bare hands more than one occasion.  Not cool."}
{"text":"the food is great, floors are disgusting but everything else is decently clean.  why does it take 15 to 20 minutes to get seated?!?!?!? Let people seat themselves, there are 20 empty tables.  it's a freaking buffet, your seating procedure is absolutely stupid!!!!!  today is the 4th and most likely the last time i walk out the door due to the wait time to get a seat."}
{"text":"Lin's is a great place to go once or twice a year when you are just craving 1000 pounds of questionable americanized Chinese food.  This place is like your classic mall Chinese food, but done pretty well. I've been twice and there's always lots of food, it's usually hot and reasonably fresh, and the service is above average considering how busy it is.  The prices are reasonable--dinner is $10.69.   Also, I am embarrassed to say it, but the buffalo wings are way good.  Why the three stars? Two reasons...  First, the customer base here is really... interesting. It's kind of like eating while sitting on the floor of an inner city Walmart. There are children running around everywhere, most of whom are poorly dressed. When I went a couple nights ago, I saw a fat 9 yr old boy with a \"YOU SUCK\" t-shirt on, and another kid about 5 yrs old with skull and crossbones logos all over his baggy sweatshirt. To be fair, most of the older clientele are just regular fat guys grubbing out at the ol' buffet, but a fair number of the customers here just exude a lack of class. Lin's has a huge pump bottle of A1 near the \"steak\" area. I mean really... if it's under the guise of Chinese buffet, they sure aren't trying very hard.  Second, for some reason there is this intense sense of discomfort associated with being at Lin's that I can't really explain, like you just want to scarf down all your food as fast as you can and get the hell out of there. I think it's mostly caused by the crowdedness everywhere. The chairs are pretty close to each other, the people at the buffet seem ravenous and you always have to be careful to not bump into Big Momma behind you who is snatching up all the crawfish, corn on the cob and french fries she can. Nobody goes here for the atmosphere, and usually I don't care at all about things like this, but here it's extreme and you feel very rushed.  I'll go back the next time I have no regard for my health or happiness and just need to gorge myself on cheap food, because the food really isn't too bad, but I would not make Lin's a regular on my list."}
{"text":"Really good buffet, had sushi, chinese, and it was great."}
{"text":"I was brought here by acquaintances I was visiting & they love this place so I had very high expectations...it was alright. Not crazy impressed but at least I didn't end with food poisoning. The corn on the cob was extremely over cooked, the soda refill by your server could easily be replaced by just putting a dispenser, don't know why they haven't don that since I believe the food comes with the soda refills (my party didn't let me pay so I'm unsure). But I'll always suggest buffets to people that have picky eaters in their party. So no stressing over a specific cuisine. I was grateful for their salad bar though ;)"}
{"text":"not so great of a buffet. we arrived and went to the buffet. upon coming to sit down there were no drinks at the table. both my boyfriend and I got halfway through our first plate and still no drinks... no waiters in sight either. we asked the hostess and she got them for us. besides this, there was nothing on the buffet I was interested in besides cheese wontons and spring rolls... all of the chicken was very low quality. it was fatty/hard/old/tasted off. it's pricey for what they have to choose from. they do have more desserts than any other buffet we've been to, but as we all know, chinese buffet desserts suck so that's irrelevant."}
{"text":"Group of coworkers and I went to try Lins for lunch, and after reading several reviews, I was interested in seeing how clean the floor was, to my surprise it was clean, tables & counter tops were clean as well. We told the hostess that we were a party of 11 and they looked confused on where to put us, they sat us in the back at 2 different tables so the party got broken up, but that didn't really bother us too much. The buffet was 8 per person not including drink, I ordered a drink and it averaged about 11 for the meal. Another thing I was searching for was the enchiladas, few had mentioned that there was some and low and below I found them! Cheese enchiladas, I didn't try them but some coworkers did and they said they tasted good. The buffet offered a lot of choices for food, any picky eater would be able to find something, but the food itself was ok it wasn't bad, but it wasn't spectacular, and left me wanting more in flavor. Glad I went and checked out Lins but I probably will not be going out of my way to try it again."}
{"text":"It's disgusting to know I've been to this place a hand full of times but today was the last. Roaches walking on the food and throught the pans. I told one of the workers but all he did was smile at me. I'm reporting them to health inspectors."}
{"text":"This place was really good when they first opened, however over the past few years this place has become increasingly sketchy and unclean."}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday night and it's pretty packed but no worries because this establishment is large enough. There is a wait though to be seated and you pay first and are given a number. Now let's get to the food.... I have to say their selection is outstanding like over 60 items to choose from including awesome stir fry. It's pretty much laid out as any buffet but one exception, very well organized! The staff is incredibly sweet and on top of things to ensure your visit is good. Don't mind other reviews check it out for yourself. I recommend Saturday because who knows how the other days are.  Go around 5 pm and not after 7 pm."}
{"text":"So good!!! I went through 5 plates during one meal! I dont get the bad reviews...everything I had was great. Im not a sushi fan so did not try that or get to the steak but will definitely go back! Lets hope the quality of food does not start to diminish like a few other buffets in the city."}
{"text":"Came here for a family dinner. Service at the front was alright. We had to wait for all of our parties to get here just to be seated, but then after a while they just decided to let us seat and go eat. They had a lot of variety in foods, but in my opinion any place can and its more about quality. So, mostly everything I ate there was ok. Probably the egg drop soup and salt and pepper shrimp would be something I'd consider always getting.   The best thing I would say they have is the made to order steak. Get it any way you want it. I got it medium rare and it was really tasty. Couldn't go wrong with that one.  Another thing that was good and I took notice was the service on my drinks. I think their name was Andrew. He made sure our drinks were always filled even before I had to even ask. I don't know about anyone else, but to me that's always a big plus when I dine out in places. All in all, its an alright place to me for a buffet."}
{"text":"Price is reasonable, good food and customer service. Visiting AZ and yelped for buffet, glad we picked this one!"}
{"text":"A very nice looking place and outstandingly well kept. Food was mostly what you'd expect. The salt & Pepper shrimp are tiny, looked awful, are tasted just about as much. He chicken skewers and sushi were nothing to write home about either. I was disappointed since these are two Of my favorites. Surprisingly--and I know this is probably not what you came for, but maybe you should--the ribs and buffalo wings were delicious!  Overall three stars. I'd give 3.5 just for how clean and neat the place is. For me, personally, my favorites missing likely means I'll try somewhere else next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I use to go to Lin's Grand Buffet in El Paso, Texas. Great Food as always and lots of food to select from"}
{"text":"Food was cold, shrimp not properly cooked through, workers seemed to be uninterested in service, I suppose you get what you pay for though!"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant. Terrible food. There are so many good Asian style buffets out there, that I thought this one might be good as well. WRONG. The only good thing is the green beans. I am not a picky eater and the two times I came here I left disappointed and grossed out. I would describe the container they store their mystery sushi meat in as a \"chum bucket\". Yes, it's that bad."}
{"text":"A fast-paced buffet with very tasty food. I arrived on a Sunday about 11:30 AM. Even though they just opened up at 11, the restaurant was already full. I had to wait in line to pay, but the wait was only about four minutes once I was seated the server came by got me my beverage and I was off to load up my plate. The selection of foods was quite vast. Everything was fresh and as I was loading up I saw several attendees bringing out more fresh food. Lin's also had a Mongolian Grill, the only downside to that was the options were limited and you don't get the choice of what sauces to add to your food. After eating my fill, I left around 12:30 PM. When walking out the line was three times as long as it was when I arrived. So my advice, get there early or during off peak hours."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner the other night and was not impressed with the food. Everything tastes like it had been sitting there for a long time. There wasn't really much of a variety of food it seemed to just be the same thing repeated in different flavors. Wife and I got sick that night too."}
{"text":"I usually like buffets because I'm a fat ass and I eat more than Rosie O'Donnell but this place did not tickle my fancy. The food was mediocre and it was a bit too crowded in there. With the combination of blasting A/C and screaming children, I didn't want to stay there long. I tried as much as I could aside from what was against the back wall because my lunch break was close to being over.   The thing that bothered me the most was that they didn't bother to de-shell (if thats what it's called) the shrimp, it still had a full shell and all of it's little legs attached :/  So I doubt I'll be coming back here again, though I won't fail to mention if you do like coming here that they have a neat To-Go offer where you can fill a styrofoam box with a pound of food for 4.97. So I guess that's nice."}
{"text":"This is the best buffet that ive had in a long time..well worth the drive from and less than $10 per person..I love this place..lots of food & deserts to choose from..You need to make sure you go with a big appitite..."}
{"text":"If I could give it 0 stars I would. This place was terrible today! The service was half assed and it was VERY hot! We asked for the manager and they sent our waitress. Worst service. We lost our appetites due to how hot it was in there. They did nothing to compensate or make things better. We had sweat rolling down our faces and backs! We brought in a group of 30 and they didn't seem to care! We won't be back."}
{"text":"Not my favorite buffett.  Sushi was bland and not many choices.  Steak was overcooked (I told him medium rare and it was almost well done). Mongolian grill was good.  The rest of the choices are your normal selection. It was quite busy, which in a buffett is a very good thing (food gets changed out faster).  You do pay before you go even sit down, so be aware.  Also, there is potatoe salad right by the pudding. Be careful, as I almost screwed that up."}
{"text":"Really shitty customer service. All the waitress did was argue with us over a drink for a 2 year old. Not coming back here again."}
{"text":"I really hate cold buffet food. Nd today all items were cold. Maybe we arrived too soon after opening but we had to leave and I asked for a refund. I was given a gift card for a return visit which was nice."}
{"text":"OH snap!  Reminds me of chinese restaurants back in my home in New York. There is no sterile smell that most buffets have.   Great selection of all your favorite Chinese (not really Chinese food) Food is freshly made. Staff is polite. And the booths are clean and comfortable.   There is a line of course, because the food is really that good! Someone suggested it and I was like not really. Cuz phoenix Chinese food sucks. But as I dived into the food my eyebrows went up and the food went down.  Plan on visiting soon.   Worth the price"}
{"text":"as i walked in i thought to myself \"wow\".  i figured it was probably because the establishment was new.  very nice ambiance.  it seems like there is alot of room around the tables and even the actual buffets.  i didn't bump into anyone.  the service was great.  we went during lunch and it was busy with all the lunch folk.  because it was busy we didn't see our server often but she did meet all our needs.  the food seemed to be better than average buffet food.  i enjoy going to this place because i know alot of crappy buffets in the phoenix area and this place sets itself apart from others."}
{"text":"I Yelped this restaurant while we were in search of Chinese while visiting Phoenix. The stars were high enough for my comfort level and I was not disappointed!  The lunch buffet price is reasonable and the variety of food is HUGE. My kiddo was entertained by the \"baby octopus\" option on the buffet.  Typical American/Chinese fare, with some Southwest additions. I think I ate more of the Mexican food available than the Chinese. Try the enchiladas!"}
{"text":"I am only giving this place 1 star because I cant give it zero.  This place is absolutely disgusting.  We drove by this place a lot in the past week because we were frequenting South Mountain Preserve and with all the blazing lights outside, we thought this place was literally beckoning us to try them out.  I'm already not a huge fan of buffets for hygienic reasons and because most buffets are built for high capacity food to be dished out quickly. As a result the foods in buffets are rarely ever made fresh. But there are a few I'm actually impressed with, so I cant completely disregard buffets as a whole.  The outside of this place looks like a Chinese ski lodge with a neon light trim. There is nothing around it except for a Circle K across the street, so this place really stands out.  Kids under 2 eat free. I kinda wish we were all under 2 years old tonight for this meal.  The cashier was friendly, the host was weird about seating us and our server was probably the best part about that place. So II'll take back my first sentence, Id like to give that one star to her.  The place was very busy which I thought was a sure sign that it was going to be a great buffet, but I took a good look around. A reaaallllly good look.  If you took every single person that was on parole in AZ and seated them at a Chinese buffet, that's what you would get. 'Twas a bit creepy in there.  Aside from that, let me get down to the food....  I took a little bit of everything.  It's what I always do.  The food looked weird to me, like it was purchased from the supermarket, thawed out and placed under the heat lamp for everyone.  The ONLY items that looked normal were the jello (which is already a bizarre food anyway), the rice and the ice cream.  That's it. The sushi was an absolute joke, fried fish was bready and greasy, jalapeno chicken/sweet n sour chicken all tasted like a packet of syrup was mixed and then drizzled on top.  My son (who actually has an excellent palate) said the pizza tasted like yogurt. Like YOGURT!   Quite possibly the most unsightly thing I saw tonight was a seafood blend (casserole) that looked like somebody vomited on the tray.  I saw two scrapes taken from that tray. I'll say a prayer for the 1-2 individuals who ate that tonight because that was absolutely disgusting.  There is so much food there and I'd love to go through the list, but to be honest there's no point.  Just dont go there.  Save your money and go elsewhere. Anywhere but there."}
{"text":"I will say, unlike most buffet style restaurants, I did not have to search through many plates to find a clean one. The plates, silverware and glasses were clean and spot free. I did not try everything but what I did try was tasty. I was happy with our server but feel like the price was a little steep. That's the reason for the 3 star rating, cost!"}
{"text":"Lin' s gets a star for atmosphere and a star for the fact it was clean. However, sushi choices were limited and many of the stir fry dishes were similar. Ex. Beef with broccoli looked just like the chicken with broccoli. One whole buffet table with only fried foods! Plus everything tasted super salty, probably to get patrons to drink more and eat less. It was $12.29 for dinner, but not worth it!"}
{"text":"I was sure to come here a couple of times and give it a fair shot before reviewing. Service is polite but negligent. The pretty girls at the front are very polite but often won't look you in the eye. The servers are similarly polite but often will be running past your table while they drop off your drink. After all, this is a buffet place and you can't expect service much better than that.  The food is extremely inconsistent but even on its best days is just okay and never really all that good. I tried the Mongolian Grill and found it to be very good comparatively and thought I had found a reason to actually come here. However, just today I went to put together a plate and found the pork all mixed up with the chicken. The beef is a very strange unnaturally beet red while the pork is pink. There was no doubt that there was pork mixed with the chicken. Unfortunately, for Jews and Muslims or others who refrain from pork, this is a show-stopper.  So with the Mongolian Grill (which I acutally liked) now forever off limits, I was forced to try their other offerings. Out of everything, the only things I could stomach were Teriyaki chicken sticks, the chicken and broccoli and the beef and broccoli. The other standard \"Chinese restaurant\" fare like Kung Pao beef tasted like detergent on one day. The next day I tried it, it was a little more palatable but still not very good.  After seeing the pork so carelessly mixed up with the chicken at the Mongolian Grill counter and with the overwhelming majority of the buffet items unpalatable, I will probably not come here again."}
{"text":"Dear God! I felt like I stepped back into 1960. Never went to restaurant the segregates based on race. That's just upon arrival. You add to that we were accused of shorting restaurant after we all prepaid. Oh there is more- gratuity is already added so had to hunt down waitress for drinks and never got table cleared. Terrible service. Oh and out table that we were waiting for in the segregated section was filthy with a dirty bucket and trash! Oh why did we stay!   Okay on for food. Everything is fried! The only salad was old & wilted. Food is very salty and greasy! Fruit was acceptable.   All I can say! You get what you pay for. We came to remember a family member who passed and won't be back. This place made me want To cry!!!!"}
{"text":"We went for Lin's Grand Buffet (Tempe one) on a Saturday around 12:30 pm. It was packed but we got a table pretty soon. The place is huge and the food selection is never-ending!!! Every item was warm and delicious and we were very happy and full after our lunch. Definitely the best Chinese (Westernized Chinese food) buffet in the Valley."}
{"text":"Went to this buffet to see if it taste different from the one on Baseline and it does. The other one on Baseline is way better,more clean, and better customer service."}
{"text":"I went this for the first time with my wife for dinner since they had the GRAND OPENING sign out.  This has got to be the worst buffet ever!!! the sushi were very limited, I think the sushi guy was a beginner since the rice wasn't porportional.  The food were even worst.  I will never go back here again.  I thought this place would work for us since it's closer to our home but I will need to drive a little further to maybe crazy buffet or pacific seafood buffet."}
{"text":"We've come here a few times and it's pretty consistent. If there's a lot of people, the wait is really never too long. The interior is really gorgeous with appropriate decor. There is a TON of food, and everything's good. There is  authentic Chinese food, American-Chinese food, sushi, American, and Mexican food. I was actually surprised at how good the American food was. Seriously amazing buffalo wings!! The steak was good, but the sushi sucks. Another reason for the 4 stars is that although I was expecting to see a ton of running kids, but for some reason, this place has SO many kids. I almost tripped and dropped my food 3x in one day from little kids running around. Seriously though, CONTROL YOUR CHILDREN"}
{"text":"We visit regularly (2-3 times a month for the past 2-1/2 years) and find this to be one of the best Chinese buffets around. The wait-staff are very friendly and attentive, even during their very busy periods. The food is usually fresh and very tasty. The menu does not usually change, but we have our established favorites so that is fine with us.The broccoli-beef is the most tender I have ever had,consistently, and the chicken-and-shrimp combo is especially tasty. Overall, we are quite pleased with the quality. Buffets tend to get lower reviews, but  this one is way up at the top of the list in our opinion. They have a lot of selections to choose from, and we are rarely disappointed in anything we choose.The price is reasonable for the amount of food being offered. The staff is constantly sweeping and cleaning up after the rude parents who let their children throw food on the floor. I can only assume that some of the other reviewers were thinking of another restaurant as we have never seen a bug or a hair or any problems with the food. We will definitely continue to make this our go-to place for Chinese buffet."}
{"text":"I have been back 4 times. This is a nice place, the food is fresh, there is a great variety. I like that they have a Mongolian grill, fresh bakery, a small sushi bar and a large variety of dishes.   They were quick to get us in and seated. We were served drinks immediately and our waitress kept them full. I was never thirsty.   The dining area is nicely decorated and clean, when they get busy, which is daily due to good food and varity of food , it does get a bit noisy, but is well worth it!"}
{"text":"Ok... Where to start?  Great place for kids.  All you can eat so if you have hungry teens... Perfect.... Adults don't take your glasses, cause cleanliness is low.  The steak... All you can eat steak... Was cooked perfect.  ( It's not the finest cut, but I don't care was tasty). They have more around the world choices than just Chinese.  There is all you can eat sushi as well. If the sushi is the only reason your going, don't but perfect if your kids and teens like it."}
{"text":"The food is really good here and is always very busy as well. I do think it's probably one of the most expensive buffets I've been too but it's a really good place to go out to eat with the family"}
{"text":"Food was great but service is HORRIBLE , the waiter just goes to the front and talk , I had one drink the entire time I was there , no refills no nothing and then she had the audacity to ask for a tip !"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that after reading all the reviews, I did not know what to expect. I'm happy to report that I was pleasantly surprised. The food selection, quality, and taste was better than expected.  They have a good selection of different types of Asian cuisine, Mongolian beef, salads, seafood, and deserts.    The restaurant was full on a Friday evening and the staff or doing a great job keeping up with our drinks and getting rid of the dirty plates.  I'm giving it five stars because of the selection of food cleanliness of the restaurant and courteous and efficient service from the staff.  Price cannot be beat."}
{"text":"This was one of the best chinese buffets that I have eaten in Phoenix.  Went for lunch around 1pm.  Everything was fresh when I went.  The sushi was limited and not a great selection, but sushi can be expensive so I understand.  The price was great at $10.  I tried so many things on the buffet and liked them all."}
{"text":"You come inside, stand in a line to pay a cashier about $12 per person (does not include drink), and then stand in a different line so someone can tell you where to sit. I constantly ask Why?!  Why pay that kinda money when you can go to a restaurant where you'll be seated and given a menu, place an order, served, checked on, and then dishes cleared from your table instead of dishes gathering -and all for the same price. Yes, I realize you get so much more variety, but the quality??? In case you haven't picked up on this yet I am not a fan of Chinese buffet -anywhere.   Quality is always sub par and price just seems to cover the excessive waste and not actual product.   Oysters are dry, over cooked, and some are so bad I had to remove from my mouth. Shrimp is over done.  Baby octopus were whole.  That was interesting. My husband and son said the bread is really good. Lmao.  You gonna make bread your meal at a buffet? More often than not my husband and I could split an entrée and still have leftovers, if we could ever agree on eating the same thing.  So variety IS good, but for me this place just doesn't seem to do a single thing on their buffet really well.   Unless it's the bread my son and husband seem to like."}
{"text":"Pretty cheap option to eat endless food that's of both good selection and quality from appetizers, through entree, and even onto dessert. Gorgeous vaulted main dining room with plenty of seating; even on a Saturday at dinner time the wait was less than 10 minutes.   Sushi bar accommodated extra seaweed salad that was not on Buffett line due to vegetarian dietary restrictions limiting selection.   Overall good experience!"}
{"text":"This place used to be one of my favorite Chinese buffets. My family and I would frequent this establishment several times per month. I moved away to Ohio.   Upon a visit back to Phoenix and to Lins Chinese buffet I was surprised to discover how much they've let this place get ran down.   The appearance of the outside was enough to keep me away. Their edge of the parking lot was filled with tons of trash and sidewalks leading into restaurant was of dried stains everywhere.   They really need to spend a day cleaning up outside picking up all the trash and power washing the sidewalks and parking lot.   Then invest in making this a habit maybe weekly.   Once inside the restaurant, they seemed short handed with waiting staff as there were plenty of seats available but we had to wait 20 minutes to get seated.   The food was good, though. Unfortunately, the other aspects of what goes into a good restaurant were missing.    Good food, dirty restaurant on the outside, understaffed on the inside.   I will say though, our waiter, whom had half the restaurant, did a fantastic job."}
{"text":"We have always gone to Lins Buffet on McDowell Rd. at least once a week or more. so we had family come in from the East to visit. They were rude from the door to the waitress. So embarassing. Our company had a small baby that they were not willing to work with to seat comfortably. They put us in a high traffic area. They weren't busy there were other tables to seat us at out of the way and they said absoulutely NO. Said it was a closed area but there were people in that section.So as we ate our dinner very uncomfortably  asthey were seating in the area we asked for. Very upsetting when a restaurant is not baby friendly. It was a very disappointing dinner that night and will not probably be back and will pass the word to not go if you have a small baby because there is no where to seat them"}

{"text":"I've been to a lot of Asian buffets! Trust me when I say this place is not bad at all. It is a really BIG and clean place to eat. As far as the food goes the chicken was not that great. The service was not as well. But the noodles and rice were pretty good. You feel like you're in a fancy dinning place. I will come back."}
{"text":"WORST BUFFET EVER! The place was disgusting and dirty, I had a feeling we would regret this after we got seated to our filthy booth. The food was terrible, my boyfriend and I ended up getting food poisoning from eating at this \"restaurant\". We will never be going back there again."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here today 2/5/15 the food was good as always we usually do take out but every now & then eat in today we dined in. Service was good. As we were eating our meal right in the booth next to the kitchen & between the buffet. We see a bug on the wall. Immediately we told our waiter who killed the bug & we left! I advised the girls at the front desk so I'm writing this in hopes she tells management and they get this issue resolved. I don't think we will be dining in for quit awhile much less eating here again."}
{"text":"Customer service at its worst. With a side of decent Chinese buffet food.  It was a 30 minute drive, our first trip, and didn't even mind waiting 20 minutes in line, just to pay and get checked in, then another 10 minutes to be seated.  But it went to hell after that, starting with seating us, then asking us to get up and move for another party of 2, then seated at a table that wobbled at least an inch each way, then to the back corner without AC or air movement.  There were MANY other empty tables that we could have been changed with, but the Mexican server refused.  Told us that we'd have to go get back in line, to be reseated. Then couldn't get refills or ice.  We won't be back.  And I'll make sure all of my people know why too.  Honestly, if you are white, don't waste your time coming here, unless you like being discriminated against by the Mexican staff that are catering to the Mexican customers."}
{"text":"Very nice place, new and clean. Food is just OK. Typical Chinese buffet food, nothing new. Price is fair.  Sushi doesn't look like sushi at all."}
{"text":"Lin's used to have great food. Now this place is a dump. I ate here today and the food was burned and dryed out. The orange chicked was over cooked and hard. I will not be back here again. I will take my money else where. The waitress could care less when i told her what i thought of the food. Stay away and save your money."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic here and they have a huge variety of foods. If your looking for a great Chinesse restraunt this one should be at the top of your list. Yum yum yum!"}
{"text":"If you like but they said they did buffet but it's still a buffet. My recommendation is to get the Mongolian Grill noodles they customize it and it takes away some of the buffet effects"}
{"text":"Let me start by acknowledging that my family really likes this place and would likely give it a higher rating. I, however, am less than impressed with Lin Sue's.  When it first opened they did a great job of maintaining the serving lines in terms of cleanliness.  Nowadays, it's hit or miss.  Today's visit wasn't too bad, but the ice cream machine was just plain nasty!  So much so that I didn't allow my kiddos to have any. They also haven't done much to maintain the place in general. Many of the chairs are in need of being replaced or reupholstered and the carpet is severely worn and in need of replacement.  There is always a decent crowd here so I'd love to see them reinvest some of their profits into keeping the place nice.  Most of the food is decent - my hubby and son love the ribs and we all love the sopapillas - but it is buffet, which means if there aren't a lot of diners the food will not be fresh.  That was the case with the chicken nuggets, french fries, and salad tonight unfortunately."}
{"text":"This place is a definite hit or miss Chinese buffet. We've gone here about 5 times, three of those visits were worthy of 1 star, the other two visits deserved 4 stars.  The last visit was horribly pathetic on so many levels, not all Lin's fault but hey, it is what it is. It was grocery shopping day, so usually we grab something quick after we unload and put away the groceries. Lin's is right around the corner, so we debate a bit on where to go and ultimately end up here. We say to each other \"I hope this is a HIT night, not a miss\". It was a miss, but still edible and the kids love picking out their own entrees. Here's where the demotion of stars happens, again not directly Lin's doing.  A family comes in after us, maybe 6 of them. They are seated directly behind our table. After the loud belching and choice words the man and woman start to argue, spewing out F bombs here and there, threatening each other with physical harm. He dares her to get up and try to slap his face, she dares him right back...she double dares him..ooooooooh! Well I started to get a little uncomfortable with the conversation, mainly because my 4 year old and 6 year old are sponges....and my 12 year old just stares and giggles. They also had a 6 year old, I know this because that's the topic of their argument. She says \"you just a baby daddy, shut your f'ing mouth, you never do bleep when it comes to him so mind your own business...blah blah blah. Suddenly she decides to chuck a heavy glass salt shaker at him with the force of an MLB pitcher, but obviously this 200+ lb woman isn't on any league, and misses. Unfortunately her aim was right at my head...it swooshed by so fast on the top of my head, whew, luckily it didn't hit me head on. Here's where I'm confused, the waitress saw this event and asked me if I was alright, I was. Not once were these animals asked to leave, or confronted by the staff. My husband had to say something to the lady but other than that it was a free for all. I'm sure we'll eat there again...just be cautious of who sits near you...and please Lin's, replace those salt shakers with the cheap plastic or cardboard ones :)"}
{"text":"My favorite buffet! Best selection and frequently replenished"}
{"text":"Best large buffet in the Valley, easily. NOT the best large buffet , those are in Ohio, where the buffet wars have spawned super-buffets that would bring tears to your eyes. But for Phoenix, Lins Wins :) Its usually fairly busy, which means food is being always re stocked, so its always hot and fresh."}
{"text":"It's OK buffet. I am a fan of pork but they don't have many :(. It's a plus for the desserts, lots more than other buffet.  The space is really nice, big and cozy."}
{"text":"Okay this place has a odd selection of food but I guess it's to accommodate the area of the type of people who come in there. I never been to a Chinese Buffet that has enchiladas with sushi and Chinese food. over all it was good, a lot better than most buffets in phoenix. It was very clean and the waitress was very attentive to refilling your drinks. I would go back especially for the fried shrimp and some other Chinese food items.."}
{"text":"I gave it four stars because the food was really good. The Mongolian grill was the star. Everything was fresh and simple to understand. The chef knew his stuff. Suggested the sauce and spice to go with the ingredients i picked. Grilled just right.  The buffet was a hit or miss. 90% was not labeled so you had to play a guessing game. My husband liked his beef and broccoli and corn. Once they made new spring rolls and cheese wontons they were great. The pot stickers were good too. Not a big desert area. No donuts. Fantastic is what my husband said. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst buffet I've ever been to. The food was horrible. The service wasn't too bad the waiters were actually pretty good at bringing us drinks. The sushi selection was bad and the rice on the sushi rolls was hard. Hardly any good meat selections, the food entrees weren't tasty and had weird combinations. Definitely wouldn't recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Not sure if it was a homeless shelter or a Chinese buffet. Poor cooked. Dry food like its been out for a long time. Flys.. Homeless people walking around asking for money. Parkinglot trash baby diapers and huslers outside.. Kids running around crying. Waitresses roll their eyes asking them a question.. Zero stars.."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner today with a friend of mine, and I'm glad that I did.  What a great buffet!  The place was large, clean, and had a huge spread of food that seemed endless.  Price was fair for dinner, as it was $27 for the both of us.  I was really impressed with this one.  Some of the features that they have here are a Sushi station, a mongol ion BBQ area, plenty of desserts, and plenty of food for all to eat.  They also had quite the desert spread as well.  One of the better buffet's I've seen in town.  If your in the area, definitely go check this place out. Really worth it!"}
{"text":"I ate their food and couldn't wait to drink water to wash the taste away. If that doesn't say it all, then I'm at a loss for words."}
{"text":"This is my first review, so as you can imagine, I really liked this place.  First off, it is cheap.  $11\Adult and $6\Kids (Over 4)  Second, some of it was top notch.  I am a huge Spareribs fan, and if you catch them bringing a fresh set out, the ribs there will compete with any I have had anywhere else.  Last but not least, is choice.  They have 3 rows of buffet and a cook to order section (It was okay but not the highlight).  My son is not a big foodie, so it is usually hard for us to go out anywhere but an Applebee's or equivilant and that gets boring.  This is not a straight chinese buffet.  They had nuggets, wings, onion rings and fries just to name a few options.  This means everyone in my family had something to eat and we all left happy.  And leaving happy is the most important thing when going out."}
{"text":"When my husband and I go to a Chinese buffet, it has to have the hibachi area. Lin's has one and it is delicious. We always love the options of hibachi, orange chicken, general tso's chicken, coconut shrimp, egg rolls, sesame chicken and lo mein are fantastic. Good deal and we are repeat customers."}
{"text":"There's an old idiom that reads \"One's eyes are bigger than one's stomach\". Whoever said that obviously ate at Lin's.   I find the decoration to be tacky, but I must admit this is the largest buffet I've seen in years. Three rows of hot food...a row of desserts, fruit, and salad. But there's more. A sushi counter and a Mongolian grill!  I'm going to be honest and say I haven't tried everything here. That would take at least 3 more trips. But I take note of the selection. It has every dish you'd expect at a place like this and more. Enchiladas, crawfish (seriously, WTF? And I mean that in a good way), or a pile of cooked mushrooms I wish I had room for. I wanted to devour everything here. Also, there's a full bottle of Sriacha at every table. What more could you ask for?  Quite frankly, I can't readily name a Chinese buffet that's better than Lin's. It was so close to getting five stars, but it activated a couple of my pet peeves. I don't like condescending signs that read something along the lines of  \"Rules: Finish your food!\" When my kung pao chicken was half peanuts, you're damn skippy I didn't clean my plate. Also, I hate not being able to get my own drink. It was 90 degrees out and of course I was going to be plenty thirsty. To be fair, service was fast, asking me if I needed anything every 5 minutes.  All of that said, I don't think this place is worth that fifth star. I just have a hunch there's a better buffet in the valley. Fellow Yelpers--help me find it!"}
{"text":"Their FB page and pictures were nothing compared to what was actually offered. Definitely wasn't worth $86+ for my family of 6. Some food was okay..."}
{"text":"This would be that \"worst dining out experience of all time\" I mentioned in my last review.  When you first walk in there is hope for the place.  As you cross the threshold, however, you realize you were wrong.  Very, very wrong.  It was, again, $30 for us to eat and drink.  Fine.  Common for Chinese buffet.  IF ANYTHING WAS EDIBLE!!!!  The floor was filthy.  The table was dirty where we were seated.  We were told to go get our food first and when we came back it would be clean.  How appetizing.  Not only were all the selections WELL picked over, they were also cold, and tasteless.  I was afraid to select anything, let alone eat it.  All the silverware I pulled out of the cups was dirty.  Not water-stained - but had FOOD still stuck to it.  *shiver*  As I walked around choosing my food (carefully) I stumbled upon the section of BABY OCTOPUS.  Now, folks, I don't care what you eat... But I do not need to see 50 WHOLE DEAD BABY CREATURES.  That was what pushed me over the edge.  You can't have dirty floors, dirty tables, a dirty Mongolian bar area, serve CRAP CRAP CRAP skirt steak to my husband, have 100% cold picked-over food, and then have a TRAY full of dead baby grossness.  Can't deal.  Won't deal.  I ate one sweet-roll thing, hubby picked his food over... and that was the end.  I would not recommend this place to ANYONE."}
{"text":"Even though I gave this 4 stars I was tempted to give it just 3 but are giving them the benefit of the doubt having eaten there a few times. The place is remarkably clean. The food is usually very good although a few dishes, especially the desserts and Mongolian BBQ could be improved upon. I have to give them credit though for also offering steaks even though I rarely get them. On our last visit the food was as good as previous visits but will visit it again to see if it goes back to the level it ws, if not the star rating will go down."}
{"text":"I only do take out here because it is usually very crowded, and I'm not used to sitting in a Chinese food restaurant. The food is higher quality than most buffets. It's still salty sweet meat spice explosion, which American style Chinese food is supposed to be. The veggies are usually crunchy and there is a nice variety of options when you want something quick and not a burger."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to find a good Chinese buffet that has all of my favorite items, and this place is the best place I've found yet in Phoenix!  They have a huge amount of variety, and the food all tasted great!  The only thing I didn't enjoy all that much was the dessert options. I didn't come to a buffet to eat jello and fruit. And it would have been nice if they at least had some type of toppings for the ice cream, like chocolate syrup or sprinkles."}
{"text":"The system to pay is to complicated you have to pay for the ticket and then show them a specific ticket that you paid for. Couple of the people at the front are not friendly, and I'm sorry but what is a buffet without fountain drinks there is no fountain and you have to pay extra for sofa. They make it hard to enjoy a buffet when they don't refill your drinks. Besides that the food is good!"}
{"text":"Great selection of food including the sushi bar ( very fresh) Mongolian BBQ (included freshly grilled steak ).  Prices were great."}
{"text":"The food was ok. A good selection. But the bathrooms are disgusting toilet paper everywhere, shit smeared on the walls and toilets all clogged up. So nasty. Won't go there again!!! You can tell they don't clean their bathrooms."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to lunch here on his day off, arriving just as they opened at 11am.  I first went to use the men's bathroom, which looked and smelled like it hadn't been cleaned in days, though an attendant walked in with a broom, cleaning sprays and fresh rolls of paper towels just as I was exiting.  On my way back to our table I noticed all of the dining room carpeting was stained gray-black and replete with small food particles/debris, as if it had been vacuumed with a vacuum cleaner with a broken belt. The buffet food on the steam tables was so-so at best, with many of the breaded chicken dishes so overcooked you could chip a tooth on your stir fry.  The sushi was almost inedible, despite being freshly prepared, tasting like it was made from thawed frozen fish just about to turn.  Neither of us tried the Mongolian bbq.  Given the price of $12 per person for lunch with drink and tax, I have to declare that there are numerous other Chinese buffets around the metro area offering better food in a much cleaner setting.  Thus, I can't imagine ever returning to Lin's."}
{"text":"Our 5 yr old granddaughter graduated from preschool tonight. When I asked her where she would like to go to dinner she said \"Lin's  Nana\"  we really like the food so I was delighted she asked to go there!!! The waiters are very nice and never leave our beverages empty for long and clear the used dishes in a timely manner. The Buffet is well stocked frequently. They also have an excellent choice of fruit. The only thing I would suggest is milk and juice for the kids."}
{"text":"It no wonder the parking lot was empty.  The service is terrible.  Two hostesses in the front just chatting away with each other,  asked us if we wanted a table because all their booths were dirty. The entrance of the restaurant was dirty too. Tsktsk. What a waste of labor dollars.  Last time we come here."}
{"text":"This place scores well on the standards for inexpensive buffets. The trick for all such places is to find which dishes you like and just eat those. My favorite dish here is the non-sauced salt-and-pepper pork ribs, always full-flavored, juicy, and tender.. Also good are the crawdads, cob corn, baked yam, fried zucchini, the Mongolian BBQ, the peel-and-eat shrimp, and the cold seafood salad. The sushi is fresh and good, but there is nothing beyond the standard rolls, at least not at lunch. Avoid the hot and sour soup, which is missing the prok flavor and wood-ear crunch. Most of the steam table stir fry dishes are unremarkable; they tend to be bland.   The decor is attractive and we've never had a problem with service. There are huge crowds on the weekends, so if you're just trying the place out a weekday is better."}
{"text":"my wife and i went there on new years eve. it was busy but not packed to the rim. the prices are great. the food was great and there so much to pick from. they have just about everything you would want. they had Chinese,sushi,steak, desert's cream, everything you ask for. i would totally suggest you try them . i know my wife will be back. and it is a very nice place too and the decor is great too."}
{"text":"Christmas dinner here this year. Food was about what you would expect from a buffet.  Huge selection and all pretty tasty. Very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"we love this place Missy often asked to go right there as soon as she lands LOL she a picky eater and can find stuff she loves there....Great food!"}
{"text":"My wife had not been to a Chinese Buffet in years and her wish for mothers day was to find the best possible place in Phoenix, Az. We live in Prescott Valley and our Chinese food restaurants/buffets are very limited. We arrived at 11:00am their opening time and there was a line inside and out. I thought wow, this must be a great place. The quantity of food was there. Our server was excellent. I remembered why I don't frequent these places often because of the overeaters. I will say the so called sushi was terrible. I ordered a hot tea and it normally comes with a little kettle and hot water. Not this one. Just Luke warm water. I didn't get a lot of flavor from the food. A little bland even on the kung pow.   Needless to say, it will be another year before I try another buffet."}
{"text":"We found this place through a giant billboard off the ten and while the billboard suggest wonders beyond our imagination I have to be honest.  This buffet is not 5 stars.  The food is good.  Nothing too special.  You can find the same exact buffet Chinese food at almost all low priced Chinese places.  They seem to have more options then most which may or may not entice you to go here.  What sold us was the Mongolian grill.  But to our dismay you don't get to pick what sauces and the topping options are very limited. Also the meat looked liked it had been sitting there a while.  The chef that cooked our plates through every sauce he had behind the counter on our dish which turned it into burnt blackness.    They do have a sushi counter with \"fresh sushi\" I doubt its of a grade that wouldn't make you sick.  I would avoid sushi at a buffet unless you are in Vegas.    They have about 4 rows containing different type of rows.  2 and half are deep fried foods and the rest are just typical buffet stuff.  The desserts are the same flavourless ice milk and semi sugar cakes you get at almost all Chinese buffets in the valley.    The inside is pretty dirty the floors were a mess when I got there.  Its kind of like they struggle to keep up.  The buffet areas were clean though.    Overall I would say this is a good bet if you want to gourde yourself as its only 25 bucks for 2 people.  You can eat and eat and eat and be full all day.  But other then that I would avoid."}
{"text":"Use to love this place. But today we found a bug in the fried rice. Should have taken a picture to post, but just wanted it gone. Seeing that we decided to leave and eat elsewhere. We asked for a refund, and was given it no problem. Long wait just to get a disappointment. Felt bad for whoever got rice from the same batch, hopefully it was removed like they said."}
{"text":"The sushi here is bomb diggity awesome. They have other good food here as well, but I found myself going back to the sushi bar over and over again. Really fresh sushi, and for only $13 (the price to dine here)."}
{"text":"Look. I hate to admit I even go to buffets from time to time but this is actually a pretty decent Chinese buffet.  The employees were all very friendly and they were very attentive, the food was actually very flavorful and very good, it has Mongolian barbecue and a sushi station.  The upside to this buffet is that you can eat as healthy or as bad as you would like. For a Chinese buffet in a marginal area of town is actually remarkably very clean. It is definitely worth checking out. There's no way to give a buffet five stars so this will get a solid four star from me. When you take into consideration the price you really can't beat it.  Sidenote; I went there at 3 PM on a weekday."}
{"text":"I would give this place ZERO stars if I could. This is such a rip off. Food was cold and disgusting. Nothing was fresh or nearly warm. Even the popular stuff like orange chicken and fried rice. Took maybe 3 bites and was unhappy. Went up to the front and asked for a manager. Waited 10 minutes to speak to one and when she approached me she said \"what's the Problem\". I expressed to her I was unhappy and wanted a refund and she asked if we ate and I told her maybe 3 bites. She said she cannot give me a refund. I said why not, she said because you ate the food. I said where are your signs that say no refunds? She was completely clueless and offered me nothing, not even to warm up the food or remake Anything. Not a voucher coupon. Strongly discourage anyone from going to this place. Absolutely disgusting and very dissatisfied. Do not go here!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good, place was clean, service was spot on, can't ask for more!"}
{"text":"Cashier was friendly, then went over to the hostess and she was so rude. Usually come to this location every Sunday and that same hostess is always there with her terrible attitude, customer service is really important and she obviously needs training. Our waiter was very nice and efficient, food was good. Food can be amazing but if you get bad service it can turn your whole experience around."}
{"text":"My insides are dryer than a 90 year old nun right now so please, please stop with all the salt.  Everything about this place was great except for the literal bags of salt that must be being poured into many of the dishes, rendering them almost inedible.  I told my gf after we left that we got a really good deal at this place... $11.99 per person and at least $7 in salt each.  She didn't laugh."}
{"text":"Easily a 5 star buffet. I went here yesterday (Monday) for lunch about 1:30 or so. I was greeted as I entered, paid just over $10 for lunch with a water and was seated at a table. The first trip I made was to the grill and sushi. The grill was out of noodles, but the veggies and meat I chose were done very nicely and the guy working was extremely nice. In fact everybody who worked there was really nice. The sushi was pretty good as well, with nice large rolls including a couple with raw fish. They were kept the correct temperature and was being monitored and replenished by the sushi chef. All the food that I had from the buffet was pretty good...nothing struck me as off or bad.... Of course it wouldn't be a Chinese buffet in the Valley if they didn't have some sort of tacos/ tamales/ enchiladas here... which they had enchiladas that were okay.   Some of the best dishes in my opinion were the cheese wonton which was not too crunchy like most places.... the baby octopus was very tender and not overly chewy like most buffets, the baked salmon was amazing, and for desert I enjoyed hte powdered donut holes as well as a slice of chocolate chip chocolate cake with some vanilla soft serve. Most likely I will be back to this place."}
{"text":"Variety is on average, no wow dishes, and all the food is prepared just about how you'd expect. No surprises, good or bad. It was busy, but I'm not sure why."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best buffets I have been too very good!! I went with a date and let me just say it has very wonderful selections for everyone including kids!! 28$ for two people on a Saturday night!! The price is kind of steep but you get your belly full every time!! Love the Egg Drop Soup and the Sushi!!"}
{"text":"There is a large selection of Chinese and seafood. They have a Mongolian bar, some sushi and shrimp cooked different ways. They change the food out often but it is greasy. The ice cream machine is popular but i saw an employee use a bucket to put water and powder in. Needless to say the vanilla soft serve tasted like dirty bucket."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to come here just to try it out and, plus, it was on the way to the grocery store.  Anyway, when we first walked in, it seemed to be extremely large on the outside and in the lobby area. After my boyfriend paid for our meals & drinks, we were escorted to our seats. The interior is beautiful - as well as the tables we ate on! I absolutely loved the decoration pieces - but, honestly, that's as far as I'll go with praises.  While I do understand that one shouldn't have high expectations at a buffet, we were still met with disappointment.  The food wasn't very good and it actually made me sick (nausea) while my boyfriend felt it as well. I'm only writing this review now because I was trying to take care of my stomach. The food was very bland period and while the restaurant itself seemed grand and wonderful - the selections weren't very diverse. It only had the minimal types of food one would expect at a $5.99 buffet.  Another thing I didn't like were how the selections were laid out as well. Why was the sushi bar hidden? The Mongolian Grill would have been a nice addition if it didn't have pizza, cakes, and cookies next to it. Shouldn't the cakes & cookies be in the dessert section anyway? Speaking of the dessert, they were also laid out by the seafood - which, I personally felt, was something that majorly concerned me as a whole.  This buffet was not worth the price my boyfriend and I paid for (even if we did get free refills) and for sure, we will not be going back again."}
{"text":"Very unorganized from the get-go. When you walk in, there's a line to the door (on busy nights) that you have to wait in to pay. Then you go to another line at the host station and wait to be seated.   I'm not a big fan of buffets in general, but if you are, you'll surely love this one. They have every kind of Chinese dish you can imagine: General Tao's chicken, beef and broccoli, veggie delight, fried rice.......  You'll even find a few non-Chinese selections, like a salad station, baked potatoes and French fries. The dessert station was pretty weak. Carrot cake, brownies, white cake and pudding. There's also a vanilla frozen yogurt machine, although they don't offer any toppings. Who doesn't have chocolate sauce for frozen yogurt?  I really have no desire to go back again."}
{"text":"If you enjoy a place where you dont know what you're eating and eating nothing but grease. This is the place for you. The food, or shoud i say foods were drenched in gease. It was very disgusting, my family and i are always sketchy about eating at chinese buffet's and this place reminded us why we never go to chinese buffet's.   Sincerely,  Disgusted with Lin's Buffet"}
{"text":"After a long day out on the water, my DB team was looking for a fast dinner that had a variety. This place worked out well. Good variety of food and my teammates got their fill. The only complaint I had was with the slowness of paying for our dinner and then getting seated. The food was good though. Plenty of seats and space for my team."}
{"text":"Came her for dinner and was extremely disappointed!! For one. It's over priced. 2. The seating area part was closed off and we couldn't sit wherever which was stupid. 3. The food is disgusting! It's a waste. The cooks are different because everything tastes gross not the same as before. This place has gone down as far as the food. Go to Hibachi grill or ChinaCity."}
{"text":"Better than an average Chinese buffet for sure. I like that the chicken was crispy and everything had great flavor. Sushi not so good though."}
{"text":"I wish I could give 0 stars!!! What a horrible place to go to. Very expensive for one thing! Went with my family and in laws for a nice lunch. We got our food and sat down. My husband bit into his egg roll and there was a cockroach INSIDE the egg roll! Absolutely disgusting! He went to throw up while I requested a manager. After 5 mins of waiting and no manager, we went to the front! We were told the manager on duty was \"on his way to the restuarant!\" We request a refund just to be told that no refunds may be given without manager approval! We said if we don't receive our refund then we will show and tell everyone what we found in our food. She was then ready to give us our refund! Her story sounded like such a lie. Sounds like the manager leaves everything to his employees. Every business MUST have a manager on duty!! I am disgusted! I have never had such a horrible experience! How would you like to have a bug come out of your food!?! I think you would like a refund of your money especially when it cost you $30 for just 2 people! HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"They are building one of these near us on Baseline rd so we decided to try them out at the McDowell location first. The place is definately popular and crowded. The buffet selection was as expected and the food was good. Service was good considering the large amount of people eating.   I am a big fan of sushi but the prepared selection was dismal. You can have some made to order but no one was around to take our order. Things got worse as my son needed to use the restroom. After seeing how awful the men's room was, I asked my wife to check on the women's room. She stated it was even worse. So sadly, we left our meal early just so we could get our son to a restroom. It certainly made us think twice about visiting this location again. We hope that we will have a better experience at the new location on Baseline once it opens."}
{"text":"Bomb food! I've been to a lot of Chinese food buffets and this one is top notch. Quality food and a great variety of foods to select from. You definitely get your moneys worth. And our waitor was great. He always made sure our drinks were full and our plates were cleared off the table once we were done. Keep in mind the place was busy! Truly impressed for my first impression. Definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"Where else can you get chicken 12 ways, and all good too... This is the only place, and everything else is good also...  FYI... dont be fooled by that lin's seafood buffet (stay away at all costs), its not affiliated with lin's grand buffet."}
{"text":"I went to Lin's for lunch and I am a fan! I actually live in San Diego, CA, but I was visiting people in Ariziona. My boyfriend and I were very impressed by Lin's.  Lunch = $8.50 - $9.00 excluding drinks & the best part is they have crawfish during lunch!  They also had fried chicken, baby octopus, sushi, and a lot of other great food I cannot remember.  The place is so beautiful!  Because of Lin's, I hate San Diego's buffets."}
{"text":"The food is good, but hate coming here to stand in line at the register cause the ppl they have are so slow. We don't come very often just because of this.   Another thing is I love sushi but can't eat their a cause it's all artificial crab, and no real fish, I'm allergic to artificial crab."}
{"text":"I hate chinese buffets.  With that said, Lins is one step above the typical crappy chinese buffet, but only by one step.  They have the Mongolian grill and steaks on order, and that's their saving grace.  Oh, and the fried fish and shrimp is good too.  Now for the bad.  Don't ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, go on a Sunday.  And don't expect the Sunday crowd to speak English.  And don't expect that same crowd to have any manners or etiquette.  I stood in line for nearly an hour and four people just cut in front of me and when I confronted them they stared and said \"no hablo\".  So then my buddy told them in Spanish, and they just stared longer.  I ended up pushing them out of my way.  The guy working the steak counter will refuse to get your steak cooked to your order if you don't ask in spanish, so learn how to say medium rare in spanish now.  At this chinese buffet there are enchiladas on the buffet line.  I tried them.  Not a good idea."}
{"text":"Decent food, price a little high. Entire experience dulled a little by no military discount. Once seated and dining, nobody came by to refresh drinks, even after requesting refills; waiter/manager was just plain dismissive and rude. None of the buffet items were labeled. On top of all this, the no firearms allowed sign left this 21 year military veteran, concealed carry permit holder tuned off, vulnerable, and alienated in a state with constitutional concealed carry. That, and  the gang graffiti carved into the front door told me that \"we cater to dirt-bags.\" .....I won't go back....so sad."}
{"text":"Came in and drinks were good. Went up to the Mongolian grill and there wasn't much variety out. My dad and I got what we wanted and told the person what we want. He had about 10 plates in front of him. My dad asked if he was making a collection and he claimed he was taking orders. By the time all the plates (except my dads and mine) were on the grill he forgot what everyone has asked for. Half an hour later my plate still wasn't on the grill and I had already lost my appetite. Oh and should I mention how disgusting the floor is? My feet sank into it as if it were wet and what was once red carpeting is now black. Never returning."}
{"text":"I've been to several different restaurants across the valley and honestly, it's a buffet so I don't expect much. I do expect the food to at least be hot/warm. However as soon as I got here I got a few different things. The salmon, wings, and green beans were cold. I would ask how often do they check the temperatures but no one knew.   This place probably should be inspected I'm 100% sure they are not keeping up food safety standards."}
{"text":"4 stars : Based on Buffet Criterion (Not a $$$ Posh Dining experience).   My new favorite Asian Buffet (Using Hong Kong Gourmet, Crazy Buffet, Pacific Seafood as comparison) Something there for everyone - Sushi, BBQ, Mongolian Grill, Tons of Seafood items, lots of Vegetarian Items (which is super hard to come by in general...let alone at buffet).   Can we talk about the fact that the food is, actually, good? At a buffet!?  Yes...and the bathrooms are large and clean. A weirdly big deal for me at buffets, but I digress.    My favorite part...they're actually cheaper than a few places, by a couple bucks.  I have yet to do check in on them again, as some other reviewers remark that they're inconsistent...but I sure hope that's not the case."}
{"text":"Great food and lots of choices. It's definitely an above average Chinese buffet. It's always busy every time I'm there. Which is good because that keeps the food turning. I never miss a chance when I'm in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Mediocre food. Overpriced buffet. Only come here for the sushi and the haven't had the California Roll for several times!"}
{"text":"4 1/2 if Available, nothing is perfect!  So first I am not a buffet fan and went with my brother in law and son after we did some go cart racing up on University.  Going in knowing you are going to a buffet and not a five star Chinese restaurant helps.  With that this is by far the best buffet (outside the real high end Las Vegas ones) I have ever been to.  The food is hot, tasty, plenty of choices and FRESH.  The price is also very reasonable (I think $13ish) for dinner. Lins has changed my opinion on the nasty Chinese Buffets that surround this town!  I will be back."}
{"text":"This place had great food it is clean fresh food and everyone can find something they like here. They even have desert too  the best part it is kid friendly. I will say for lunch they are a little high but you will not leave being stuffed and happy you went"}
{"text":"We stopped by here since we were in the neighborhood after visiting with friends.  The place looks nice from the outside - similar to a large log cabin.  Service was friendly inside, food was plentiful, but to me, did not taste good.  It lacked a lot of flavor and quite a few food items had been sitting out for a while.  I would not come back to this place as I would be able to spend my $40 (2 adults, 1 child) some place nicer with better quality food."}
{"text":"Great selection, sushi is \"americanized\" but still very good.  Their wasabi will singe your nose hairs!!  Best sweet and sour soup I've ever had.  Plus, the service was excellent.  We'll be back."}
