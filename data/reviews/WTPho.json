{"text":"Just as good as pho kim long. Ordered the rare steak pho. Not as much steak given as pho kim. They also do not have boba. The pho was really good though. I like to add egg noodles with mine"}
{"text":"The food is a bit more pricier than other pho places but the food is good and it is close to my house so I don't mind. The pho broth is pretty good, not too oily or salty. They have other dishes as well, such as some curries and some Thai dishes. The place is clean and the staff is friendly. I am definitely a regular here."}
{"text":"The name speaks for itself it's not real pho place. I should have taken my money else like at jenni pho. Their egg rolls ain't even the Vietnamese egg rolls. The spring rolls has too much noodles and the pho broth was real oily."}
{"text":"Even though I'm asian and I love all asian dishes I'm not a big fan of pho for some reason, till I had their Pork Pho! I love the Confit pork, so tender and packed with flavor. Porches egg in soup was another hit for me.  Service was great too. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great food, very friendly service. Good size portions. Staff wants your experience to be perfect. Reasonable priced meals. Welcome them to SW Las Vegas."}
{"text":"We tried this place when it first opened cause it was closer than China Town - it needed  A LOT of work then and not much has changed to date. We like our pho with egg noodles which is usually an additional $1 extra (Jenni Pho, Annie Pho, China town, etc...). This place charges $2 extra, we were blown away! Not that it was a deal breaker, but for a cost spiked way more than the better pho places even the ones in the casinos, we were at least expecting quality. Epic fail! Owner or management needs a reality check on their product quality this place will never be a standing wait room kind of place like the Ramen Kobo that just opened on Durango/215. Waste of money, time, and a disappointment. I can't say we never gave it a chance, we tried it twice there will NOT be a third time!"}
{"text":"The food is great but there are a lot of wonderful places to eat in Las Vegas. With that being said, service should be part of the package. They charge for everything and if you complain that the food isn't right or salty they will make you pay for it anyway. It's too bad. I will have to find a place with good pho and great service."}
{"text":"Great choice if you are in the Blue Diamond area. I had the Beef flank Pho, son had chicken pho & daughter had fried rice and bbq chicken. All the food was yummy, didn't give 5 stars cuz we still like more options available like at pho kim long on spring mountain. We would totally eat here again if in that side of town."}
{"text":"wtpho i would say wtf!! the pho isnt even worthy. it taste like hot water with salt in it. i dont even taste the broth. the chicken wings was too small. its not even wothy to goin this place. the atmosphere is nice but the foods and stuff are not wothy."}
{"text":"Pros:
1.  Food is great! I love their spring rolls and it seems they make their own peanut sauce because it taste different than other place; its really good.  Great Pho.
2.  Very friendly service.
3.  Fast service.

Neutral:
1.  Just the right price.
2.  The place is clean, but nothing especial with the decor.

Conclusion:  Good value"}
{"text":"This place has only been open for a few weeks so they're working out some kinks. With that in mind, they're doing fantastic.  BEST FRIED RICE IN TOWN (I ordered shrimp in mine)!!!!! 

The pho menu is very simple - it only lists beef, chicken or pork pho as your choices, but they were happy to customize my order for shrimp pho with extra veggies.  The broth is smooth, unlike many restaurants in town which have overly-greasy broth. 

They have several Thai dishes on the menu which I'm looking forward to trying.  Did I mention they have the BEST FRIED RICE IN TOWN!? 

The restaurant is clean and the staff is super friendly.  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Everything is over price!! It's close by house but they would be my last resort if I'm desperate for some Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Variable selection, great flavor. Surprisingly, my pho tasted great even the next day for leftover lunch, which I've never been able to have. The Thai tea was delicious but not as rich in flavor as I'm used to, and that was a little disappointing.

Our waiter was attentive and cheerful and food came out quickly. Great price for everything you get.

The place is not very big, thus I can only assume it would be better to go during non-busy hours to avoid long wait times and ease of getting a table. We also had a really hard time finding this place because it's at the end of two sectioned plazas, and is hard to see by the lights."}
{"text":"Pho is decent. We appreciate how well they package it up when we order takeout. You'd think with all that broth it would definitely be all over the car by the time you get home, but it never even spills a drop. Veggies always taste extra fresh. Also like the crab rangoons!! The staff is always very nice."}
{"text":"So happy that I found this place nearby my house! Their Curry is very delicious! And I am obsessed with their fried tofu and vegetable pho soup !!!!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Pho.  The broth is very fragrant but not fishy or fatty.  It's clear and you get more of the spices/herbs.  Pho Annie has a great presentation but i dont like fishy broth.  

Also,  they give you the exact right amount/combination of extras.  I love the goodie bag that comes with the Pho.  Jalapeno slices, lots of bean sprouts, noodles, onions cilantro, lime and more!!!  They do it perfect!!!! I'M HOOKED."}
{"text":"Lovely neighborhood eatery. My husband loved his pad thai and i think my fried rice dish was excellent. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Shrimp pad Thai is probably the best I've had. Crab rangoons are really good too!   Never ordered something from here that I didn't like.  Def should check this place out!"}
{"text":"They're great. My second favorite Vietnamese place in the US. 

Friendly, fast, accommodating and great Pho."}
{"text":"Love it! The drunken noodles and curry dishes were the best I've had. Will absolutely be going back for more!"}
{"text":"Probably one of my new go to pho places in SW area! Not only their service is really good but the broth for the pho is also good! Worth the try!"}
{"text":"First time here and had a great experience. Seating was fast as it was early for dinner on a week night, menu was easy to pursue and decide. I got the combination pho with beef meat balls and brisket, the price is very competitive to other places I've been to and the broth is just as yummy and delicious. (also got the egg roles 4pc on the side to share with my friends as appetizer). Definitely try eating your pho with the Hoisin and spicy Sriracha sauce, either putting directly into your pho or, as I like to do, i put it in a small sauce bowl and dip my noodles and meat in before eating to get more sauce :))
Waitstaff here is attentive and helpful, and parking is easy to find at this small shopping center.
Would definitely come back here if i was in the area and craving some Pho."}
{"text":"Great little spot for pho. Great broth. Not expensive. Very friendly staff. Worth the stop"}
{"text":"We've been here quite a few times and haven't been disappointed. So happy to have a consistently good pho place nearby that I can depend on!"}
{"text":"Service is always perfect!  I have always ordered ToGo and they have NEVER got it wrong.....and I'm that customer. Lol. The broth in their Pho is to die for and seasoned to perfection.  Really appreciate a good Pho location in Mountain's Edge!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Asian inspired food with good pho too highly recommend good value also. We had yellow curry, some noodle dish and beef pho all hot fresh and lots of flavors. The food is also prepared quickly which I love"}
{"text":"Love these guys, great Familky atmosphere and very healthy delicious food!"}
{"text":"First time I tried their rare steak pho, it surpassed my expectations. 
Second time I ordered it, admittedly it was around 11:15 am so maybe the soup broth didn't have enough time to steep, but it was very flavorless.

Also tried their red curry dish, but after a few spoonfuls did not try any more. It was watery and not like the red curry flavors from Archi's, Pin Kaow, etc.

A big plus would be if they offered delivery, but at the moment, dine in or pickup only. Friendly service over the phone though.  Good for when you're in the mood for some pho in the Mountain's Edge area, but too lazy to drive too far for it. But if you have the time and strong craving for pho, it's probably worth it to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"The wings were bomb the curry wonton were the best ever the waiter was being real help but seemed like he was rushing me to order after I ordered he wasn't so eager anymore or bugging  I had the rare steak chicken breast it was to die for but the waiter was to to to much after our appetizers we almost left because he was just to pushy"}
{"text":"I always said that I would stop in since they opened, however, I never did until a few nights ago.  I ordered the BBQ Chick with fried rice no egg.  It was great and very filling.  The staff was nice and informative.  I liked it so much, I went back and brought a friend.  I found a new place that is local and serves great food.

{"text":"I eat here all the time.  Everyone is always friendly here, and treat you like they genuinely care about having your business.  I only get tofu pad thai, but it is amazing.  Very happy I live just down the street from it."}
{"text":"Ok so I've come to realize this place is actually half Vietnamese food (pho) and half Thai since they have diff flavors of pho and also Thai dishes such as pad Thai, papaya salad, etc. I ordered the panang curry with chicken as my usual go to for Thai food and I was a little disappointed here. My panang curry flavor was right.. kinda but what made it a disappointing experience was the fact that it came out like a soup! I've included a video of how watery it is. Oh and it came with onions.. which panang doesn't usually but I thought it was fine bc you can throw just about any vegetables my way and I would enjoy it except when it's a raw onion... and I love onions. Just not the raw ones. I really want to like this place since it's nearby my neighborhood but I can't. I've been here 3x and each time I try to give it a chance and get something new and hope for the best but every single time it tastes like fast food. Or like.. no love put into their food kinda thing. The pho is very bland. Even with a ton of fresh squeezed lime. The crab Rangoon just tastes like nothing special. Maybe if they would get a better wrap or thinner or something. I can't put my finger on it. The Thai tea I've got once and never again! And I absolutely love Thai tea. Sigh. Ok well the only thing that i did enjoy here is the spring rolls. I like how the noodles in the spring rolls are super thin. And I'm glad the peanut sauce is good. Hmmm i wonder if I cook down the panang it will thicken up. Ok well thanks for reading my post."}
{"text":"Between the cute name and the fact that it's not strictly a Vietnamese place (it's half Vietnamese and half Thai), my expectations were not high. But so deep is my phobession that I'm always looking for new places to add to the rotation, some variety, something different, and when I finally tried it I came away very impressed. I've been coming here regularly ever since. This place is not merely worthy of inclusion on the pho rotation; it's one of my favorite places on the list.

Their pho broth is very good, a bit clearer and leaner than average for the area, and the regular beef pho is very good. Note that they use beef broth exclusively, even in the chicken pho--no vegetarian pho is offered, so if that one annoying friend is with you, you'll need to hit Pho 88 or Red Lantern or Pho Kim Long.

Their shrimp pho is the best I've had. It's not really traditional; it includes several extra vegetables, and the shrimp are not served with the tails still on, a mildly annoying thing other places do. This is The Place for shrimp pho; it's fantastic.

They also do a pork combination pho, embellished with the inclusion of a poached egg, which is interesting and different. There are several pork pho options on the menu including pork belly.

The chicken pho is very good despite using beef broth. I usually balk at chicken pho with beef broth, but here, it's worth eating.

As noted, they also have a lot of Thai food on the menu, none of which I have tried so I can't speak to it.

Service is a lot better than most pho places, since again, it's not strictly a Vietnamese place. I'm so white that I can't really tell the difference, but I think the waitresses are Thai. They are very friendly and attentive and you will never be sitting there trying to get someone's attention like you do at most pho places.

One thing to consider: they are closed on Sundays and major holidays like Labor Day. It's always the same people working so it's probably just that they don't have the staff for everyone to have a day off.

One strange thing is that they don't have little dipping dishes on the table. The hoisin and sriracha and chile paste are there, but no dishes. They have them, and will give you one if you ask, but really--all you're doing by not having the dishes on the table is encouraging the barbaric practice of dumping the sauces into the broth!

Also, they always give me a fork. Maybe because I'm white?"}
{"text":"My fav pho place in Vegas! The Thai coffee is my favvvvvv also. It's a hybrid of Thai tea + Viet coffee."}
{"text":"The soup is not very flavorful, especially if you know really good pho. Sorry but it was not that great. And the quality of the meat was mediocre. And the prices are way too high."}
{"text":"Clean & inviting. Great service. Impressive menu. Quick service and hot fresh made to order entrees. What more could you ask for? Check this place out, you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Very sweet staff putting up with my ridiculous cell phone muffled take out order! The order was right, fed my family happily and I will be back! Thanks for delicious dinner WTPho!"}
{"text":"I gotta say that this is my favorite Tai place in Vegas!
We live nowhere near it but make the 20 minute drive each way from work when it's what we have to have."}
{"text":"This restaurant selected the right name for their restaurant.  Their Pho is so delicious.  Their broth is consistent in taste and they have the freshest ingredients."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time yesterday and it is average. I started off with overpriced crispy wings. Why overpriced? Well for 6 tiny wings, they charge you $6. This is a bit much. The sauce they drizzled on top was food but I think it was too much. I am not really a big fan of crispy wings covered in sauce. At least the presentation was nice. The pho broth was good. Nothing distinctive about it that made it really stand out for me. I wish they added more beef balls though. As far as their service, they were pretty quick to sit and serve me. They also constantly checked up on me to see how I was doing. One random fact about this place, they charge $2 for non-customers to use their restroom. Though I'm not really sure how they enforce this rule. I'm just glad that there's a pho place that's close. I'll give this place another try in the future and hopefully have a better review for it."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I have eaten many different pho places around the valley and this has got to be one of the best. I always get the fried tofu pho with steamed veggies. I have never had a problem with it being different each time, with some places its good one day and not the next...bit definitely not here! Never had anything but the pho, and it it pho-nomenal! ;)"}
{"text":"I love coming here. The service is always nice and the food is always good. I especially love their fresh spring roll with the peanut sauce."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The dining room is clean and well kept compared to other Pho places in the area.  The service is always quick and friendly.  I love the chicken pho soup with veggies and tofu but I've tried the rare beef one also.  The broth is so clean and not too salty.  Best part is the price!  I come here about 3 times a month!  You'll love it too! The name is awesome!"}
{"text":"It was very good! I got the shrimp phô and the vegetables were extremely fresh. The service was fantastic. They were all very attentive and made sure your drinks were always filled. I will definitely be coming back and letting my friends know about it!"}
{"text":"I'm only giving 1 star cause the service is beyond terrible. I got yelled at by a crazy Asian lady cause the waiter took the wrong order and she was yelling in the middle of the restaurant as to why I didn't want the meal bought to me. I told her that's not what I ordered she continued yelling in a restaurant full of people then proceeded to ask the waiter if he spoke to me in English and how come we didn't understand one another. Smh wow and mind you I used to eat at this establishment at least 2 times a week and never will I give them my business again."}
{"text":"Perfect Panang Curry, awesome Drunken Noodles, fresh spring rolls, and the best Pho I've found in Vegas. Love this place! Update: I can't stop craving their pineapple curry and pad Thai!!"}
{"text":"This is my Favorite Pho place in Vegas. The ingredients are super fresh and clean. It's not the typical Pho its gourmet pho IMHO. If you are looking for more traditional pho with MSG - it might not be the place for you but if your looking for a very healthy, clean, fresh, good ingredients-this is your place"}
{"text":"I just noticed this place on our way home the other night so we came for lunch today. They actually have plenty of choices of Pho. Many types of beef, types of pork and types of chicken. No veggie though :( I had rare steak and my son had the flank steak. Both were very good... I am used to a little more lemon grass flavor which would have put the broth tops in my book. Still very tasty. I am looking forward to coming back and trying their curry dishes. Also the Pho bowls are a good size... although I still feel a bit hungry not sure if that is just me today or if they could put in a bit more noodles."}
{"text":"So far, so good. So good my BF ate my left overs!  I am veggie so I just wish there was more things for me to eat. What we ordered had flavor. But I always compare to Toi in Hollywood. Otherwise I'd say 5stars.

Edited to say after eating here several times, they are always quick. So 4 stars to 5 stars. Great when we are in a hurry."}
{"text":"Love this pho place. Close to my house and such a great variety of Vietnamese and Thai food. Their chicken pho comes with so many great additions including shiitake mushrooms bok choy as well as the regular additions of jalapeño lime bamboo shoots and scallions. They are very prompt with their takeout orders and everything comes home hot and delicious. I love the crab Rangoon and the pad see ewe as well."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch the other day, meeting up with a friend, before going to her house. 

I've personally seen this place many times while traveling up/down Blue Diamond and had been curious. I believe they have a food truck with the same name? 

Came here on a Tuesday, around noon. Empty restaurant. Uh oh. 

Music, quite random. had a lot of old-ish songs which brought back memories, then you have new songs. Lol 

Looked at menu after sitting with my friend who was there already. So apparently its a viet and thai place? 

i wanted to try their quality of pho, so i opt'ed for the combination pho, which pretty much included everything. 

soup base was a bit bland. not enough flavor. not looking for saltiness or richness but the flavor you get from like boiling various bones for hours. The meat was stacked and clumped together. a bit overcooked. i noticed its the same meat used in my friends drunken noodles too. whats funny is i noticed a coloring or reflection on the beef while i was eating it. Apparently its not because its spoiled or anything, but it just so happens light hits it at the right angle, and diffracts the light, causing a pearly/gem/rainbow color. kind of a fun fact. XD 

my friend had ordered drunken noodles. didn't really try much since i was full from my pho, but i had one noodle. Drunken noodles is supposed to be spicy, flavored with chili, fish sauce, soy sauce, etc but for some odd reason. This version of drunk noodles from this restaurant had a sweet element to it too. The first thing i thought of was hoisin sauce. and no it was not from my pho, because i didnt use any hoisin or sriracha. weird to taste hoisin in drunken noodles. 

Overall, this place is ok. Probably won't come back (since i dont live on this side of town anyway) and there are better ones nearby."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to try this place because it's close to home, and I don't always want to go all the way to Chinatown on a Friday night. 

We ordered veggie egg rolls and shrimp spring rolls for appetizers, and they were pretty good, except the shrimp didn't seem too fresh. 

Sadly not really. I read reviews before choosing this place and figured like every other Thai or Vietnamese place in Vegas, mixed reviews are pretty standard. But the negative reviews on this place were spot on. 

I got the beef brisket and flank soup, and the meat was nowhere near as tender as it should have been, and definitely had a weird color. Hubby got the beef combination and in his words \"WTPho is WTSuck.\" The broth was very plain.. Had to add tons of sauce and sriracha to give it any flavor. Needless to say, next time we're craving pho it won't be satisfied here. 

On to the good.. Service was excellent! They were quick to refill our drinks and asked multiple times how we were doing, so they get stars for that. And then dessert.. Tempura ice cream. How can you ever go wrong? Delicious :) 

So if you're looking for a pho spot with mediocre pho but awesome people and ice cream, this is the spot for you. Next time we'll just take the trip to Chinatown for the good stuff."}
{"text":"I've spent a lot of time with Lao/thai/vietnamese people and have had the privilege of eating authentic homemade foods from each. Since moving from san francisco to las vegas, i have struggled to find the same flavors in my favorite dishes. We tried this place out and to my amazement, it was super close to the home cooking i remember. Larb, pineapple chicken curry, pad thai, ribs, and pho were on point. I am super impressed with the food. Place has a modern feel with modern rock tunes playing, service was great, and the chef is a white guy...his thai wife taught him well!! We'll be back for more!!"}
{"text":"Ugh..   I really, really wanted this place to work out.

They just opened up a few weeks ago and are literally around the corner from my house.  I kept driving by eagerly awaiting opening day as Pho joints on the SW side have really dropped the ball.   I finally got to try their Veggie Pho today, and, let's just say, I've experienced better at some of the chains that are considered really bad.

The food in itself has a lot of promise.  The broth wasn't as greasy or salty as most.  There weren't many veggies provided in my VEGGIE pho and the ones that were provided weren't very clean.  All in all, the flavor was decent..  There was just one problem.  One rather BIG problem.  I found three hairs in my Pho.  I'm a blonde and the hairs were black.  Clearly, not mine.  It sucks.  Hair is an instant meal ruiner.  Once discovered, the meal is over.   O-V-E-R.  OVERRR!  Sucks.

I also ordered their iced Thai Tea, which was delicious and the fried banana ice cream, which is pretty much impossible to mess up. The Panang Curry was delicious as well.  Great flavor.  It's just those damn hairs.  I get the shakes just thinking about them.

What do we need to do to get a great Pho joint?  I've tried places all over the valley and there's always something that ends up going horribly wrong.  I was really excited for this new place to open up as I figured they would have a new fresh product and would probably cook with some excitement.  At least for the first six months.

WTPho, may I please suggest hair nets or at least pulling hair back as a requirement?  All would have been wonderful if those three hairs didn't show up.  Now I sit, hungry and grossed out.   Also, when a customer orders the meatless Pho option, can I suggest providing more veggies?

I'm hoping these kinks will be worked out.  Keeping hair out of the food is like cooking 101.  Once I can get over the hairs, I might give WTPho one more try and an updated review.."}
{"text":"I love this place! The Thai curry was delicious! My fiancée and daughter love it as well. We try to come here at least twice a month. 

We order one of the different Thai curries (I prefer the green Thai curry with chicken extra mild) and the shrimp spring rolls!! The hot garlic sauce on the table is so good on the rolls with the peanut sauce!! Service is good and I never have to wait for anything!! We wash it down with Thai tea!!

Definitely a place worth trying!!"}
{"text":"We Went back &  tried their new special beef salad. Omg it's soo good!! It's tangy & spicy! 

They have a papaya salad on the special menu as well which we'll have to go back for. :))"}
{"text":"Great Food and reasonably priced. I mostly order to go but I have dined in before. Service is good and food is promptly served. Ambiance in the place is very bland but typical of a Pho restaurant in Vegas. My favorite is the Yellow curry with beef! I will recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"not that busy here so servers are attentive with refills and service

the spring rolls are a 2/5. they aren't tightly packed as other places

the drunked noodles are basically chow fun with gravy.. solid 

the combination pho is decent, the broth is on par with most good places and the quantity of meat is on par or slightly below. 

i will keep coming back mainly due to location and convenience"}
{"text":"I would say the best pho I have had. I had the chicken/mushroom/bok choy and it was perfect. I like how the menu is simple to understand and you know what you are getting. No questions in to what will be in your meal. Thank you for the wonderful lunch!"}
{"text":"As far as pho goes in the Southwest, this hits the spot! This is our latest go to for a warm bowl of pho in the \"cool\" Vegas weather. They give you more than enough broth for your noodles to soak up and all the fresh veggie sides to customize your soup. I also love this place because they have Thai dishes too! Price is on point!"}
{"text":"This place is conveniently located near my home so I decided to order some lunch to go. I order the shrimp spring roll and beef Thai salad. The shrimp rolls were basic but I was not a huge fan of the peanut sauce. It was basically peanut butter. The Thai salad was good. Nice citrus flavors balanced with cilantro and peppers. The place itself was clean and the staff was very friendly. I will come back to try the pho and curry."}
{"text":"On multiple occasions I have tried calling in an order and they turn their phones off when it's too busy. Great way to run a business. 

The food is good but they need to work on customer service."}
{"text":"Favorite pho place on the southwest side of town. All other broths are tasteless compared to WTPho. Love their pho, drunken noodles and especially their springs rolls. Wish they were open 7 days a week!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, the soup was ok.  I got the beef, the meat seemed a little bit too fatty and overcooked maybe.  I haven't really had pho much, it could just be that I am not a big fan of it.  The service was very fast and friendly, I appreciated that, and my coworkers seemed to enjoy their meals."}
{"text":"Super nice staff, delicious food. Checked it out on a Friday night with my kids. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"WT pho gets 3 stars because I couldn't do 2 and a half and I thought that what I ate hit the spot enough I thought they were better then a 2 star. This little joint have been here for a while and good for them, I have not been here yet myself because of all the bad reviews and from all of my friends telling me to eat somewhere else. But I finally gave in because I really really wanted Laos food and they were super close to my house. Since the people are Thai and not Viet they were able to accommodate. 

Kay and the rest of the staff is super nice and surprisingly the food is pretty good. I didn't get the pho because a lot of people have said that their pho is exactly that WTF! I can't say for myself so I will not talk about their pho but for them to have pork pho umm ok and then they throw egg in it so weird. Anyhow I came for the Lao food so let's get down to it. First the Waterfall steak is an off the menu item and Kay made it so good just plain oh beef slices but she marinade with all the spices, lime onion and cilantro and it was so good. The red curry was really really good I got it with pork and the bamboo made it so bomb. The jerky was fried to a perfect chew and crispness accompanied by the sticky rice and dipping sauce made all worth it to me because it reminded me of my moms home cooking and it really hit the spot. Then she was so nice to do the papaya salad Laos style for me but that came out super salty and had a slight awkward smell to it. I didn't like it much actually I couldn't stomach it. I should have ordered it her Thai style I'm sure it would have been way better and delicious next time. 

All in all I think I will definitely be back for their food the pho I will have to try to find out if I should continue to stay away from it or not. But for now they are close by, the food is pretty darn good, the price is awesome and the staff are nice. I'm glad I came and gave them a try!"}
{"text":"So delicious! My boyfriend and I have gone there multiple times and have received great service. I usually stick to chicken pad thai (which is amazing and better than Chinese xo) and my boyfriend always tries something new. He has loved every dish he's ordered there! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Hit this spot up with a friend. The egg rolls were hot!! So gooood. We also ordered the chicken breast pho, mushrooms, etc. We split that order, but once we received our bowls, they were huge. We couldn't believe that by splitting it, it would still be more than enough for one person. It was tasty, delicious, and easy on the stomach. Wouldn't mind trying something else from the menu. The chicken was missing \"something\" though."}
{"text":"I'm not extremely knowledge on what constitutes great pho but I love this place for the food. Great portion sizes great meat cuts. And the name is pretty funny. But check it out I think you'll love the food and the prices are reasonable as well."}
{"text":"It's not Pho Kim Long or Pho Saigon. This is a very simple Pho place with minimum food and favor. Nothing special. My first and my last! Nothing else to say because there is nothing to this pho place."}
{"text":"This place was good. Only giving it a 4 because I went to a different pho 2 days later. Pho Vietnam grille express and this place just went above and beyond. Even boxed my pho for me and I've yet have any one do that before. The service at wtpho is superb. Water glass was never empty. People were nice. No complaints at all. Ide go there again cause it's closer. I would give 5 stars but I'm sitting down at the pho place mentioned before and they showed me what 5stars is all about"}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to coming here for weeks and today I finally made it. In fact, I arrived a little before it opened and waited in my car for a bit. I ordered the rare steak pho and green tea. The food came out fast and hot and it was exceptionally delicious. I was the only customer there until I was almost done.

As other reviews point out, the portions are a little small, but the quality is wonderful, so I think that more than makes up for it. The quality of the broth and steak was perfect. The only thing I would change, is the waiter. I felt like he was hovering over me, kept staring and coming by to take my food while I was still eating. I felt rushed when all I wanted to do was sit back and enjoy my delicious Pho on this cold day."}
{"text":"Decent place for a bowl of pho. Their serving sizes are a bit on the small side and they are not open on Sundays."}
{"text":"Been living here 9 months now and have been to WTPho dozens of times and have tried almost everything on the menu.

IT DOES NOT DISAPPOINT!"}
{"text":"I ordered take-out a couple of weeks ago and I got the beef combination noodle soup. To me the broth was very tasty, a good amount of noodles, but there were not a lot of meat (four stars).

When I arrived the ladies greeted me and they were very friendly. I look forward to eating more pho at WTPho."}
{"text":"I came here for pho but got sidetracked by the Thai offerings. I ended up ordering Pad Thai with pork, Thai iced tea, and fried ice cream. I was a little concerned at first because I was the only one in the restaurant and when I walked in, I noticed that the place smelled a bit odd. However, the food was excellent. There was a lot of it and I really shouldn't have eaten all of it, but it was delicious so I couldn't help myself. The iced tea was actually one of the best I've had, and the ice cream was to die for (and also larger than anticipated). Will definitely return next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Pretty good pho. It's great if you're the type that likes to add a ton of sauces and toppings. I like a more rich, darker broth. Friendly service, cute and clean place, could have done with different music but hard to tell if they normally play loud hard rock all the time or if it just when we happened to be there."}
{"text":"This is the best phò place in town... If you're taste buds skew gringo. 

I decided to stop in after a workout, figuring that phò would make a good post workout meal. Next time I think that, I'll drive the extra 2 miles to Phò Annie. 

This place is terribly mediocre. I should've known something was wrong, when I saw the vato was the server and the gringo was cooking (it's like the Bizarro World). To be fair the server did his best to get me what I want. 

I ordered phò (obviously).  I tasted it... I've had better tasting broth come out of instant phò from the Asian grocery. I started loading it with herbs and lemon (no lime), as well as Sriracha and hoisin to make it edible. I ordered beef on the side (like always), but the broth wasn't hot enough to blanch it, so I basically are it raw (I felt like Grace Jones). 

Needless to say, I won't be back anytime soon... Unless I'm trashed at 4:00 in the afternoon. Which is always a possibility."}
{"text":"I love having this place moments away from my house. Always fast and great for carry out! the crab rangoon is awesome and the pho is always good. The red curry is the best!"}
{"text":"The pho is good but I complained about hair in my soup 
They were nice enough to give me another one...we also ordered egg rolls and since it's a Vietnamese restaurant I expected it to be meat, instead it's veggies. They said it's Thai style.  Oh well..."}
{"text":"Amazing pho's in here! 
Give it a try, you won't regret it. 
The beef combination is a killer!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere 3/5**
Service 5/5
Food 4/5

First things first, the atmosphere is alright. A bit too bland for me, it just comes off sorta like, I don't know, like a hospital cafeteria. A bit weird, but that's how I would describe it.

Service was excellent, the server was extremely attentive. Although I WAS the only guest, so I guess you could take that rating with a grain of salt.

Food wise: surprisingly good. The curry wonton is awesome. The wonton itself is alright, but the panang curry dipping sauce it comes with is TO DIE FOR. I seriously downed three servings of it, it's that good. The pho's broth surprised me. It was flavorfful, although a bit on the flat side in terms of seasoning, it was good enough to compliment the extremely spicy sauce on their rack. The portioning of meat/noodles was beyond what I would expect for a pho restaurant, all in all, outstanding.

Check this place out, it's a nice and new startup. Needs a refresher course on marketing and they could be the next big thing in the Mountain's Edge area :-)

Edit:  **Improved atmosphere. 4/5 

The broth is as good as ever. Pricing and portioning could do with some tweaking. Either give more for the current price or charge less for the current portioning. 

Im not naive so I can assume it's because the location is really nice and they have to pay a lot, but dang, it's hard to justify spending that much money for a bowl of good pho in Las Vegas where good pho is a dime a dozen. 

PS: To my fellow spicy fanatics, their chili garlic paste is REALLY SPICY. Enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Ate there tonight for the first time and it was DELICIOUS!!! We got the Spring Rolls as an appetizer, a beef Pho dish and the green chicken curry... ALL AMAZING. Very fresh and high quality ingredients... will definitely be making this a regular eating spot now!!!"}
{"text":"Wtpho? Why do they not have more pho options? Pho and thai restaurant but they only have 3 different types of pho on the menu - beef, pork, or chicken. A bit more variety would be nice ¯\_(?)_/¯. 

I got the red curry with pork. It came with a plate of rice. Not bad. I enjoyed it. Good mix of veggies and meat. My sister got the beef pho. I tried some and wasn't too impressed. The broth was sorta bland. Pho noodles were cooked perfectly though. 

Service was awesome. The staff was attentive and nice. We came around lunch time and were the only ones there so it was a little awkward. They put on a movie on the tv right above our table and stood in front of the kitchen and watched the movie while we were eating. I felt a little uncomfortable because it felt like they were watching us the whole time.

I'd probably come back but only because this place is literally across the street from my house."}
{"text":"I Eat here all the time.  Their Pho is awesome and I love the authentic new Thai Chili seasoning they're now using."}
{"text":"Tried their pad thai and it was just alright.. I didn't like how the noodles were so stubborn, where I couldn't bite through them.. They were tough ones! Also, it's drowned in sauce so if you're not into that, then I wouldn't recommend it. Pretty good portion for the price though."}
{"text":"The restaurant is very clean and the staff is friendly. We were helped right away and the server brought our food out to us quickly. We ordered the Pho Tai, Pad thai, veggie eggrolls and tofu pho. All of the food was fresh and the flavors were great. The service was awesome. Our server was super attentive and constantly made sure we enjoyed the food, had water, etc. This will definitely be our new pho place!"}
{"text":"It's a nice and clean small space w an open kitchen. The waiter is friendly but the manager/ owner doesn't have a clue about customer service. First of all, \"the customer is always right\" policy does not seem to apply here. I ordered a pho with well-done and rare meat. They got my order wrong and gave me only one type of meat, rare meat prepared well done. When I explained that I ordered two types of meat (well-done and rare meat) they gave me a lesson on how I should've ordered my food. No apologies, no refund, no credit. Seems very rude and lacks customer service. Simply offering to correct the order would've saved them a life time customer."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what others are complaining about. My wife and I live nearby and like to support small local businesses. In short, we were beyond impressed with not only the food but also the exemplary service. I understand why they have a limited variety of pho(the three that they have are so good, and besides, their other items are incredible). I love curry... Their curry is unbelievable, the drunken noodles are addictive. This is our new favorite Vietnamese joint!!!"}
{"text":"We came here since it's in our neighborhood and we were lazy to drive far for dinner. When we walked in, no hi or greeting. There was only one other party there and they saw us. You ever walk into a restaurant and feel that you are not welcomed and you are bothering them? That's what it felt like. Not off to a good start but we were hungry and already here.

We ordered the curried wontons with panang curry as a dip. It reminded me of one of those crappy, frozen appetizers you get from the market. The curry was watery and hardly any stuffing inside the wonton. 

I ordered the pho. The meat seemed old and not the best quality. The broth was bland too. My husband got one of their curry dishes. It was watery too.

The server gave me the impression that she hated her job. It's not easy waiting tables but at least fake a smile.

I will not be lazy and drive further for better pho and service."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been going here for almost two years. This is our go to Pho restaurant. Very family oriented and intimate. Very clean restaurant as well. We are regulars here but we are always trying out other pho restaurants. To be honest nothing beats this. Maybe it's just our preference. They don't just serve pho. They have Thai food on the menu as well. Definitely a must go to restaurant."}
{"text":"This place was pretty average. The food was alright and so was the service. It's close to the house so it just makes it convenient."}
{"text":"We ordered different beef Pho here, my husband and I. I was so confused. It didn't have that Pho broth flavor that I'm used to. Although various locations' broths may have their own distinctions, they are all pretty alike in many ways. Here, however, got me f*cked up. In a way where I don't trust Pho anymore. I never want to be this disappointed with the most spot-hitting soup type again. 

2 stars for friendliness even though service weren't all that amazing, considering we were one of very few tables present."}
{"text":"I'm assuming the pho is okay. I've been here twice and the other items on the menu isn't very good. The pad see ew here is wayyyyy too oily. Instead of making the dish with Chinese broccoli, they use regular broccoli. I've also tried their broccoli dish with chicken and oyster sauce. It was bland and it honestly tastes better when I make it at home. They don't use a variety of vegetables here like you would expect from a Thai/Vietnamese restaurant. I would only come here if I was desperate and not willing to drive to David wongs panasian on Durango and desert inn. Basically.... Maybe once a year? I don't know. The 4 stars for this place is really misleading."}
{"text":"WTPho might be the best kept secret in Mountains Edge. 
The chicken Pho is delicious! The broth is SO yummy. Everything is so fresh and crisp. 
Friendly service and quick take out. Skip the fast food and order up some Pho!"}
{"text":"So I have the issue of having a wife that doesn't like pho, yet loves thai food.. Im usually very skeptical of asian restaurants that deal with more than one culture of cuisine, but this place blew me away.. 

I ordered the rare steak pho.. It was absolutely delicious.. Came at the right temperature and will all the traditional sides.. Everything was fresh.. 

My wife ordered the red curry... To my surprise she said it was the best curry she has tasted in Vegas...  Win! 

The service what top notch.. I had my drink refilled 3 times and the waiter was very personable 

The price was very fair and reasonable and we had an excellent experience

Two Thumbs Up! I'd recommend this place to my friends!"}
{"text":"Finally tried the food here, the menu is a combination of Vietnamese and Thai, I was expecting only Vietnamese as that's what Pho stands for, it represents Vietnamese food, was not impress at all, it's a makeshift Vietnamese restaurant food is not great and are pricier than other better Pho restaurants, even tried a Thai dish and it too is not up to par, will stick to the other Vietnamese Pho and other Thai restaurants along S. Rainbow blvd"}
{"text":"Service: excellent. Love all the kick ass female staff they have running the joint and even cooking. Always fast and on point w phone orders. 

Food: absolutely the BEST away from Spring mtn/Sahara. BEST Thai, BEST pho. I don't understand the obsession w Archie's; it's not that great, serves crappy portions, gives very little protein w plates, and is way overpriced. WtPho kills it. I've eaten here four times now, and will never order anywhere else in a 10 mile radius (southwest/mountains edge). 

Great Thai tea. No boba. 

The pad Thai w chicken added is my favorite so far. Flavor on point and still full of tofu and veggies. 

I've tried two salads and three Pho's: broth perfect. I think I like the tonkotsu? Pork? Not an expert but very much a fan. The lime and spice in glass noodle salads are perfect, too. 

Great value. An entree plus meat and a tea less than $12 bucks. 

Try it."}
{"text":"Guys. Real talk. I am so pleasantly surprised and happy with this place.

I was feeling a little under the weather today and really wanted some pho. Now, I usually go to Jenni Pho or Annie Pho but most of the time, their broth isn't consistent. Some days, it'll be great but more often than not, it's passible. So, this place came up in my suggestions and I was a little skeptical because of its name--in California, there are places like this that basically serve food that looks good but the taste is horrible. Yet, the reviews pulled me in. 

I ordered pick up because I don't want to be eating there alone by myself lol. Now, I am writing this AS I AM EATING and boy, this broth is delicious. The broth alone made me break out my laptop and write this review. Like finally, someone got it right! I got one rare steak pho (Pho Tai) and the cream cheese rangoons. You can't go wrong with the rangoons. This pho is great. All the flavors are right AND they put cilantro in their pho--some places here don't, I really like cilantro. In all honesty, I've decided to make this my regular pho place after just one bowl of pho. Not to mention, the place itself is very clean. Definitely check them out!"}
{"text":"Very good - I had drunken rice and my wife had boiled tofu Pho.  The spicing was exquisite - especially the Pho.  Allspice should be a caress - not an assault - WTPho understands this perfectly and the result is delightful.  The restaurant is spotless, the staff is friendly, and the service excellent.  All in all a great place for lunch or dinner"}
{"text":"I have passed this joint quite a few times in the recent weeks. I decided to finally stop in tonight after work and see if they did take out. I was welcomed immediately and let him know that they did do take out and take out only took me 7 to 8 minutes at most. The beef soup was delicious as well as the crab cream cheese wontons. The portion was just perfect not too much not too little and the broth was delicious. I will be returning."}
{"text":"Getting ranked Dutchess as of today I probably have a different view on this restaurant now. 

Service is still memorable in my books. They check up on you just enough, not where they make you feel like they're rushing you out or doing too much. They always have a smile on their face and truly look like they enjoy their jobs. They are very family oriented and I say this because they sometimes have a child hanging out with them and it seems like these folks have known each other all their lives (even if they haven't). Even when they get busy, the service is still like you're the only people in the restaurant. 

The food tastes much better than I remember it tasting 9 months ago. I now have a few favorite dishes. The drunken fried rice, beef salad (without sugar), rare beef pho, fried chicken wings (sauce on the side), and papaya salad. Anytime my boyfriend and I don't know what to eat we know we can always agree on WTPho. 

5 stars for you WTPHO. I am a regular and will continue to be even when I'm not right across the street."}
{"text":"My husband was craving Pho one night, so we decided to check this place out. When we got in and saw their menu, I was surprised that they served Thai food. We both ordered a bowl of Pho Tai and the broth was on point. We also ordered the fresh spring rolls and pad Thai. Omg the Pad Thai was amazing!!!!  The servers were very nice and attentive and they always kept our glasses full. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"The food is ok but the portions are extremely small. The dinner portion should be considered the kids portion. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and the food is consistently fresh and flavorful. Prices are more than reasonable and portions are generous. You won't leave with an empty tummy! Get the shrimp pho add pork belly! Maybe a spring roll for appetizer!"}
{"text":"I eat here about once a week. Service great, and fast. Food is always on point. (I meant to write this review weeks ago when it happened) A few weeks ago my husband got called back into work at 7:00 at night when we were trying to decide what to do for dinner. So being that I was now alone with our 4 month old daughter, I called in my usual order & went to pick it up. When I arrived, the place was pretty packed. The chef recognized me and asked if I had ordered shrimp green curry or chicken. I replied shrimp. She told the young waiter that she told me it was shrimp and he'd written it down wrong, just as she thought. She told me to give her a few minutes and she'd fix it. It only took a few minutes, and I was happy to wait so that I took home the correct food. Here's why I also gave them five stars... The waitress then offered to walk my food out to the car so I didn't have to carry the car seat and the food bags. Love love love this place. Excellent food with that local feel. Recommend: Spring rolls & green curry"}
{"text":"The food was very good. I had the pad Thai noodles which I thought was on the sweet side & my husband had the chicken pho soup that he loved especially when one is sick. It made him feel better."}
{"text":"Not what I expected but still okay. It's a mix of Thai and Vietnamese cusine with traditional dishes like pho, spring rolls, papaya and beef salad along with several curry dishes. I was disappointed not to see any Vermecelli bowls however as that was what I wanted to order that night. Ordered the rare steak and beef brisket pho instead. The broth was fine, but not as flavorful as I'd like. Good and fast service though. I think if you're looking for a true vietnamese, mom and popps type spot this wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"We just moved to the SW and decided to explore and found this place on Yelp! This place is as legit as any of those on Spring Mountain. The hubs ordered chicken pho and I ordered rare steak. My husband said this was the best bowl of chicken pho he's ever had. He even ordered seconds on the noodles. We will be back to try other things. The thai food looked good too! Service was fantastic! Looked like lots of regulars which the servers welcomed back!"}
{"text":"The Pho is off the hook. Can't go wrong with pretty much anything. They finally got their stuff together and are putting out really good food. I think when they first opened is was a whole lot of nerves. I would come back and recommend to friends."}
{"text":"The food and service are quite good. However, it seems like about 50% of the time that I go they are closed for some random reason. This would be a five star review if they kept a regular schedule."}
{"text":"Delicious pho! Very satisfied. Did the flank steak and brisket. Broth was very tasty and didn't need anything. Service is great, no waiting. Love it."}
{"text":"Love the pho and crab ragoons!! Staff is kind and service is super fast! I eat here all the time and always bring friends here and they love it!"}
{"text":"Great pho place, it's close by the house. The beef jerky is great, customer service is on point as well."}
{"text":"The pho was phenomenal. Delicious broth, all fresh veggies. Very generous! I recommend putting it all in there:  jalapeños, mint, bean sprouts, YUM YUM YUM!!!! I had the veggie and my dinning partners had the brisket pho, the shrimp pad Thai and the egg rolls. The pad Thai was fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"This was my favorite pho spot! Their broth is never oily and their meats never fatty. Their broth reminded me of my fave pho restaurant in Hawaii. Friendly staff and always clean. Love that they're also super close to home. Im rating them 4 stars because lately, they've been closed on random days."}
{"text":"This review is being written for the two food items that I tried. I am a pho'ckin pho aficionado. I have had great pho in every city I've ever visited and that is a whole lotta pho. I was drawn to this establishment because of the clever name. Once entering, you'll notice that everything is very clean and very open. The tables line mostly the borders of the restaurant with a few small tables in the center. It kind of reminded me of a fast food chinese restaurant. I became wary right away. I immediately noticed that my favorite appetizer was not on the menu. No egg rolls. Yeah...those delicious vietnamese egg rolls that you wrap with lettuce and dip in sweet fish sauce? None. There were no spring rolls either. So I continue to browse the menu and notice that it is more of a vietnamese/thai restaurant. I ordered the wontons with curry as my appetizer thinking it would be some type of fusion food. I also ordered the Vietnamese staple, beef pho. The boyfriend ordered a chicken pho. He's very White-American and doesn't know any better. I don't know why, but I had expected some actual dumpling-style wontons, but we got some fried wonton chips with a tiny dish of watery curry. Disappointing. I was served before my boyfriend was. I thought it was because it took longer to cook the chicken..or something, or maybe there was smaller stock of chicken broth/soup since most people order beef pho. I guess it just took longer to cook the chicken because he still got bowl of beef pho, just with chicken pieces instead of slices of beef. There was something about the noodles that just didn't taste right. Like, they purchased the packages of dried rice noodles instead of using freshly made rice noodles. It just wasn't good. I didn't think you could go wrong with a bowl of pho since it is such a basic food (like fried rice), but you can. If I ever go back, it would only be because it is literally across the street from my housing community. Perhaps the Thai food will be better."}
{"text":"Nice chewy thick noodles, though salty soup. Brilliant store name but cheapened by using disposable chopsticks. Also, you have to pay $2 to use their washroom if you're not a customer? Meh"}
{"text":"A friend of mine recommended this place, but she was hesitant because she claims the Thai food was not great the last time she visited. Apparently there was a new chef this time because all of the food was really good, both Thai and Vietnamese. We ate at the restaurant, and the wait staff was attentive. Prices are good too."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite Thai Pho places!  Love to the green curry, panang curry and tonight my boyfriend ordered pumpkin curry!  Can I say just simply delicious!  

Even bites small bites of pumpkin is in the curry.  The curry is very flavorable.  I've also had their pho and it's very tasty too."}
{"text":"Tried this place. The service was good. Food was fast. The taste was ok. I've had better pho."}
{"text":"Great Food, great prices, great service. My favorite restaurant in SW area. Try the yellow curry."}
{"text":"Love this little gem. The food is excellent and the restaurant is very clean. My personal favorites are the Red Curry and Chicken/shiitake mushroom Pho. 

Definitely try it out!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I'm Thai and pretty yummy Thai food and close to the house! Curry wontons are yummy! Love the drunken noodles too!"}
{"text":"The portions were good. The broth was weird and had an odd flavor. The servers weren't overly friendly and although the restaurant was almost completely empty, we sat without refills on our water most of the meal. It's also odd that most of the menu is Thai food."}
{"text":"Back to WTP again. Love this place. Thanks Ki Ki!! The curry was awesome. Veggie pho was just perfect."}
{"text":"For never having Pho before, I was pleasantly surprised how flavorful it was. Now having been to multiple Pho style restaurants, they'll definitely above the rest! The portion size is great for the price and it's always a speedy service. The one downside is the other food options don't quite have as much flavor as others (I.e curry, pad Thai, etc.). If you're looking for Pho, this is the place to go. If you're looking for another Asian style option, it will definitely satisfy your craving but won't be the best you've ever had"}
{"text":"Their food's pricey and the portions are small. The taste is mediocre. You can find a much better pho place with cheaper pho and larger portions. Although I like the name, WTPho is not worth going to."}
{"text":"I've had great Pad Thai but I must say WTPho is by far THE tastiest! Will continue to order from this place!"}
{"text":"Great food! The curry is awesome! So is the Pad Thai and beef salad!!!! Really reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"My partner and I have now eaten here twice and absolutely love it! I love the \"mom and pop\" feel it offers, the service is excellent, and best of all the food will not disappoint!

I am a fan of curry and the red curry was tasty, full of great fresh veggies and more food than I could eat. 

Thanks WTPho and see you again soon!"}
{"text":"Very fast service for To Go  I was in and out quick. I tip the lady a $5 my friends told me this the best pho to get in an it is . I will come back over and over ."}
{"text":"I just have to put a shout out for WTPho. We moved form the other side of town, and needed to find a new Pho restaurant. We tried this place and wow, it's fabulous! Very clean, and the staff is remarkable. 
Our weekends usually include a stop for Pho, and after trying quite a few on the west side of Hwy15, we always seem to make it back to WTPho. No need to go to China town, although a lot of great choices there, it's always so busy and loud. This place is quiet, and the Shrimp Pho is the best I've ever had, and we've eaten a lot of Pho. The Shrimp Spring rolls are also fabulous.
 I do need to add, I've never tried anything else, so I can't comment on the other menu items, we are hoping they will decide to add they cold vermicelli dishes available at traditional Pho restaurants. A bit of a disappointment there, but that's ok, when that what we want, we go somewhere else, Thank you WTPho !!"}
{"text":"Sick and wanted some pho. Restaurant closed at 4pm on a Thursday, supposed to be open 11-930."}
{"text":"Love this little neighborhood secret. The pho is the perfect thing to comfort you after a long day."}
{"text":"Came  here last night after craving some pho. 
Ordered the rare steak and brisket pho. 
It was pretty good! The broth wasn't the tastiest I've ever had but it was pretty darn good! 
It looked super clean which is good, a lot of pho places are getting C grades lately and it's making me nervous. 
I will definitely be back here, plus I love the name haha"}
{"text":"We would get Pho here quite often before we moved to the Bay Area. Well we are back in LV and thought we would hit up one of our old haunts. We loved the fresh rolls, in fact they were the best. No the menu has changed. Only shrimp, my wife is a  vegetarian so that does not work. They would rather not sell fresh rolls than make them with tofu. Now don't get me wrong. I don't like tofu but my wife it's her chicken. 
We are the only people in the restaurant. I guess it's to hard to take the tofu and put it in a roll. Our business will need to go elsewhere. Sad!"}
{"text":"Decent food. Decent service. My problem is the food portioning. I've had pho at restaurants all over Las Vegas and I truly believe I get twice the amount of food at most other places for the same price as I pay here. They were very stingy on the raw steak in the pho. So I asked for an extra side of it for $2.50. I received 3 tiny pieces of raw steak. Pretty ridiculous. I'm not the type to openly complain about things like this. But I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"When I moved to Vegas I made it my business to find Pho like I used to get in NY. After several disappointments I stumbled on WTPho. Not only is the Pho with chicken amazing but they serve one of the best Penang curries that I've ever had."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Best pho! And try the spring rolls! Everything in this restaurant is delicious can't go wrong with WTPho!"}
{"text":"The pho is sub par and way over priced. The whole menu is over priced. There's nothing special about this place and even though I live directly across the street I wouldn't come here to get a pho fix. WTPho step up your pho game and lower your prices."}
{"text":"I've gotten food to go here before. It's nice that it's by my house but the food is seriously lacking in spice and flavor. The spring rolls were okay but I will not be back. There are much better Thai/Vietnamese places out there."}
{"text":"Came here for their combination pho and shrimp spring rolls.
I added bok choy and mushroom to my combination pho. The amount of bok choy and mushroom I got in my pho was not as generous as the other pho places. Well, they are only $1 each so I should've double ordered them. But it's nice they have so many kinds of add-on stuff (extras) for your pho and they are all reasonably priced. 
They put a lot of fatty meat in my pho... Probably that was the fattiest meat I got from any pho places I've been to. The broth was rich and tasty though.
Shrimp spring rolls were OK. I think I like Kim Long ones better.
Gosh, they have a lot of take out business!! I was only here for 30 min and I saw at least 5 people came in for take out. They even have Thai curries and Chinese fried rice on their menu!! Maybe that's why they have so much take out business.
The service was nice and quick. Right next door to 7-Eleven on Blue diamond and Cimarron."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place as it is close to work. The place is clean and the ingredients all seemed good and fresh. The service was good, but they have pho in the name and that's what I had. I was surprised that they don't even have trip in their pho but even so what it all came down to was a complete lack of flavor in the broth. I mean zero flavor."}
{"text":"I went in for lunch at 11:30 am. I ordered chicken pho. The soup came with a little bit of mushrooms and a little bit of chicken. It would have been better to load up on the chicken and skip the mushrooms. The broth was tasty and the noodles were plentiful. I probably won't be returning to this particular pho joint any time soon, even though it's close to the house."}
{"text":"I love pho and spring rolls but this place was sub par the broth was sour and stale and the 5 pieces of meat that I had gotten were mostly fat the peanut sauce tasted sour and rotten. I complained and said i didn't want to pay for the food I barely had eaten one of the host there I don't know his name started to scream at me and threatened to call the police if I didn't pay another person came over and sent the screaming man after I caved and paid and he had the nerve to say that I needed to leave tip for causing a problem. I asked this lady for the manager was told the manager wasn't in so I gave her a note to give to the manager which she said she would I turned around for a second to leave i turned back to ask for a business card and saw her throwing away my note laughing."}
{"text":"My friend told me that this place was ok. I wanted to try it out for myself. The food was not great at all. It was all very bland tasting, the pho, Thai dishes, all of it. We wanted to try the papaya salad, but the lady who makes it was not there that day. I don't think I would come back and I would not recommend it to others. I only gave it two stars because the service was really good. I guess when you go to an Asian restaurant and there are no Asian people eating there, that should've been another clue to go somewhere else. The only pros I can think of are the cute name, cleanliness, and good service."}
{"text":"This place....WOW!!! The Thai curry in this place is fantastic!! I have paid FAR MORE for curry that isn't this good! I'm typically not a fan of veggie egg/spring rolls, but theirs are to die for!! And put that garlic chili sauce on whatever you order...."}
{"text":"Man. You guys steered me wrong with Pho Annie (but that's a different review). So I was pretty wary about trying another pho place rated well on Yelp but I was across the street washing my dog and noticed this place, figured... Why not?

I did notice most of the food was Thai which was a bit forboding but went ahead and ordered the crab wontons, curry wontons, a bowl of pork belly and poached egg pho for me and the hubs got a bowl of meatball and two poached eggs pho. 

Crab wontons were so cutely folded, not sure how they do that or if they're made in a factory, but the sauce tasted homemade. The curry sauce was to die for!!! I could've made a meal out of that alone.

Then the main show, the pho. Holy crap. The broth was light and not as complex as some places, I agree, but it was inoffensive and just so perfect with a squeeze of lime and a couple a jalapeños. With the poached egg (which were perfect) it just brought it to epic levels. I didn't hear a peep from my husband for fifteen minutes as he slurped his way through both noodles and broth (pretty amazing feat for him). The egg and pork belly was so perfectly cooked; not even 99% of ramen places get this right to this level. 

Went during lunch hour and it was really empty as well. I hope their business picks up because it was awesome!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. First of all nobody was eating there so clearly they weren't busy. Nobody greeted us plus we ordered a bowl of pho and a bbq pork and sat there over 30 mins still no food. We just walked out. Literally what the fuxk??? What a waste of my time. So the bottom line is that they don't even deserve one star."}
{"text":"I love this little family owned and ran restaurant. Good food, great service and it's close to my house. The prices are great as well. I typically will go in for a to go order on my way home and they're always super fast without lacking quality. I can't wait till it gets cold again so I can fill my belly with warm Pho regularly."}
{"text":"I love this place real good food and the staff is awesome. Myself and my kids love to come eat hear whenever we can. Real good pho soap. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! I love the rare steak pho and the shrimp spring roll with peanut sauce! Yummy! Next time I'm going to try the Thai beef jerky and drunken noodles."}
{"text":"Decent place for a quick thai curry craving. Husband always orders the spare ribs with fried rice. That dish is very tasty. Ill usually order the red or green curry. Pho is bleh here. There are much better places for pho. Thai curries here are more on the soupy side but taste good. Not as authentic as places like Pin Kaow or Archis but still very good. Portion size is large. We usually will bring home leftovers. Location is on Blue Diamond in the southwest so if you live around that area its the closest thai/vietnamese food establishment if you live out there near Mountains Edge. Shrimp rolls are pretty good. I have noticed during the summer that the air conditioner doesn't cool very well."}
{"text":"Off the top all I wanted was the Shrimp Pho! I ordered it and I was in heaven. It was perfect for  a chilly night in Vegas. I'm in love with their Pho. The service was good! Well worth the drive from Southern Highlands."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to the yellow curry, but my coworkers say they've never ate anything disappointing here."}
{"text":"It was my first time here and the moment i saw the place, i got confused cuz they had thai food as well so i wasnt sure if it was a thai restaurant or a vietnamese restaurant? But anyway i had the pho and honestly i have tasted better pho in other vietnamese restaurants. The prices on their menu are so overpriced. And the amount of noodles i got on my pho was sooo little!! Well least i get to try this place out and know if im ever coming back again. :)"}
{"text":"Stopped in because my mom raves about this place. I feel like they nickel and dime you. No soda fountain so no refills etc. The food was good though- I ordered the papaya salad level 8 and it was sufficiently spicey. It was clean and the staff was nice. Oh, the Pad Thai was pretty weak and watery, but it is a Pho place so what could we expect?"}
{"text":"I hate the name, but the food was great.

On the way home from Las Vegas, this was right on the road so I stopped in. I wanted something other than a burger or fast food for supper. I had the Rare Steak and Brisket pho--OUTSTANDING! The meat was nicely slicy thin and flavorful. Couldn't decide which I enjoyed more, the steak or the brisket. Both had great flavor and tenderness. Loved it!

The broth was exceptional. I really enjoyed the broth so much that I drank it all literally to the last drop.

There were enough Thai basil, sprouts, and jalapeno to go with it.

If you are in SW Las Vegas, definitely worth going to.

5* = A top favorite. Mind-blowing good. I will definitely return and I will go out of my way to go here. Worth every dime of my money.
4* = Outstanding. Tucson-top-tier. Some elements not quite as good as it gets, but it still is worthy of my regular business.
3* = Good experience. I might do repeat business if it is convenient, the only option, the only one in its category, or on a whim, but would not be among the first thing to come to mind. Would definitely recommend you trying it to get your own take on it.
2* = Not so good. Would not recommend at all. Waste of money.
1* = How are they still in business? Stay away at all costs!"}
{"text":"WAAAAAAAAY BETTER than Pho Kim Long in China town, they're the most overrated place for Pho in town btw, anyway! So close to my home THANKFULLY and sooo flavorful!! Love this place and they were soooo nice!"}
{"text":"Use to love this place. Felt like it was clean and loved the open kitchen. My friend ordered the bbq chicken plate and the chicken had a giant hair on it. Were extremely disgusted. Will never go back again"}
{"text":"If they are busy they will NOT take your order over the phone (even though the message on the phone says their business hours). This is EXACTLY what the waiter said when I walked in. Super frustrating. However, the food is good. It's fresh. The kitchen is in the same room / vicinity as the dining area. You don't leave the place smelling like fish sauce. I wish they would let customers know in advance that they will NOT answer the phones during \"busy times\" there were 5 couples seated and two waiters. How is that \"very busy\" with two waiters? If this place wasn't super close to my house, I wouldn't have came here, but if you're craving pho, you have no choice haha. Sacrifices. Lol."}
{"text":"My \"go to\" pho spot close to home. Rare beef or steamed tofo pho are both great. Same with yellow curry. Fast service. Only complaint is they won't let you switch out one veggie for more of another with the veggie/tofu pho. I'm not a fan of the mushrooms they use so a little annoying that they can't make this an easy switch without an up-charge..."}
{"text":"Super yummy Thai Beef Salad. Surprisingly tangy and spicy and delicious. Husband had Barbecued Pork Pho and enjoyed it as well. 

Fast and pleasant service."}
{"text":"So disgusting! The broth has an inch of oil floating at the top... This soup was completely inedible. I will never come back to this place... If I could give 0 stars I would!!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately there isn't an option to give 0 stars, otherwise I would. This place is less than 5 minutes away from home but this was my first time here. All I ordered today was plain noodle pho. Order comes and of course there was meat. I looked at the receipt and it had my name and it said Flank Pho with no Vegetables. Really?! I was also charged $1.75 more for their mistake! This was definitely my first and last time here. Highly recommend you NOT come here ever!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. they turn their phones off when busy so you can't even order for pickup.  When you show up to order they basically tell you that it will take a long time if you place an order, just their way of saying fuck off. The waitress actually said we turn off the phone be cause \"we busy\". WTPho is right."}
{"text":"We like the Pho. My daughter always gets the beef ball Pho and I get the chicken Pho. They are both soooo good. I also like their yellow curry."}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I went here for the first time yesterday since it opened. It opened very recently & is very close to the gym we workout at, so we thought we'd give it a try. I'll admit, it wasn't the best experience we've had, but we've also had worse. 

We walked in & was greeted by one of their waiters saying that we can take a seat wherever we wanted. I'd say it was a nice place, small but clean. Nothing too special about the interior. 

The service however wasn't up to par. Our order was taken by a Hispanic gentleman. In no way am I racist, but that language barrier can really be difficult to overcome. My boyfriend & I noticed that when we took our order & the order of other customers close by. The staff was friendly, but I believe they were not trained well enough just yet. 

Our order took much longer than expected. We ordered their Shrimp Spring Rolls as an appetizer, I got the Beef Pho, & my boyfriend ordered the Salmon Curry. The spring rolls came out pretty quickly, as we would expect of a simple appetizer. However it took maybe 20-30 minutes for our entrees to come out. Unfortunately the owner had to come out from behind the kitchen & ask us what we had ordered, since we were sitting there for so long. It turned out that our order was accidentally placed as to-go & was just sitting there for a good while. 

What saved what seemed to be a very bad experience was that the owner gave our meal for free because it had taken so long to bring out. He was extremely apologetic about the whole thing. But enough about the service, on to the food. 

Shrimp Spring Rolls: They weren't the most amazing rolls out there, & I'll be brutally honest, they were a bit plain. The shrimp to noodle ratio wasn't balanced. There was definitely too much noodles & our rolls fell apart when we ate them. The peanut sauce wasn't all that great either & wasn't spicy like the menu said it was. 

Beef Pho: The pho to me was one of the best I've had. It's up to par with Pho Kim Long, which is usually a long time favorite among me & my friends. It wasn't like most places where it's a lot more broth than anything else. They didn't skimp on the noodles & beef, & the beef was seriously DELICIOUS. Some big pieced in there too. 

Salmon Curry: My boyfriend ordered this one. We were skeptical at first because the sauce for the curry was really runny. However the portion size of the salmon itself was actually a good size, better than most restaurants who like to serve smaller portions because salmon can be so expensive. But at only $11 for the salmon, side of broccoli, & rice, we weren't complaining. The taste of the dish was a WHOLE differently story. It was SO GOOD. Even though the curry was runny, it tasted amazing. The salmon by itself was flaky & seasoned perfectly. The combination of the two made for a very tasty dish. My boyfriend even liked the broccoli & he HATES eating broccoli. Like with a passion. Needless to say, this dish will probably be a favorite of ours. 

Overall, the restaurant definitely has a to learn. Need to work on the service & organization so that things don't get confused. But what they lacked in their training, they made up for in recognizing their flaws, learning from them, & their tasty dishes. The owner was sweet, so I directly tipped & thanked him for taking care of us. Considering they had just opened up, we weren't too hard on them, & we assured him that we'll definitely be coming back for more."}
{"text":"This was my first Pho restaurant and it was the one that got me hooked! I've tried others, but none have been able to beat WTPho for me.

The service is great, if it's your first time they will even explain the proper way to eat Pho (it does make a difference). The Pho tastes great! I've eaten in and carried out and it's great either way.

The only bad part of WTPho is that they are closed Sundays, I could eat here 7 days a week!"}
{"text":"Really good food. Tastes fresh every time I order from here. Also very friendly staff. This is my go to place when I'm craving pho."}
{"text":"I like that you're able to add pork belly to the pho. Haven't come across that anywhere that has this as an option but they don't have the option to add tripe which is strange to me. They also dont have regular eggrolls with meat in it, only vegetable for 6 bucks. Why? 

It's a but overpriced but if you don't want to venture out of Mountains Edge, then this will do. The spring rolls are good, however I would stay away from the curried wontons. They were hard as a rock with barely anything as a filling, so smothering it with panang curry doesn't help. Again, also 6 bucks."}
{"text":"Really great dining experience! Had the drunken noodles with shrimp and it was awesome. 
The flavor was perfect,  didn't even need to add anything at all.  Had it with a 7 on their spicy scale. 
Plenty of room,  nice clean place and great service."}
{"text":"I love the broth. Very rich n tasty. No need to add sauce. They give a very good amount of meat. I wish they would improve on there egg rolls. I'd say this place is different from any pho place I have eaten. Very close to our house and service is good."}
{"text":"I have tried to order at this place. But the person just set the phone down in the middle of the kitchen. I listened the the banging of pots and pans for more than 5 minutes before I gave up. I was a just fella not deserving of being able to place a simple order of a Beef Combination. 

Tried calling back for about 15 minutes and it went to a busy signal. Oh well. I'll never know what joy awaits behind the mystical doors of the Pho place next to the 7-11."}
{"text":"I love pho, and I am a picky pho eater. The broth has to be amazing. This place exceeds my expectations! My boyfriend is even pickier than i am , and he loves this place. everyone i introduce this place to loves it. Best thing is its close to my house. The meat they use here is really good quality, and i hope they dont change that like most places!"}
{"text":"So good! Pad Thai is bomb! I wasn't %100 with the pho but the fried bananas dessert was to die for. The service is fantastic! I wish I lived closer and would go more often!"}
{"text":"Good food. I ordered brown rice with the intention of it replacing white rice. I got both. I'm assuming I paid for both. :("}
{"text":"Smaller restaurant but that allowed for very quick service. I had my usual beef Phô combo which I found to be good. It had a very clear and lighter broth but packed with a lot of flavor. I really enjoyed it. In and out in 20 minutes for $13 with tip. Better than I expected."}
{"text":"Excellent food and friendly staff. Their rare steak pho is so good! It's salty when I put like 3 packets of hoisin sauce, and it's just the way I like it! Their broth is delicious, but it seems like the amount of meat I got today was lacking. No worries though because I'm all about the broth. I also ordered their chicken fried rice and omg!! I'm surprised with how good it is! It's probably the best fried rice I've had in Vegas. I ordered to-go, and I waited only 5 minutes. I'm so glad this is close to home."}
{"text":"The most amazing pho! and I'm a big fan and eat in many different placesespecially if you take vegetable with beef broth inside of tendons or your favor rare steak omg perfect broth! They even add shiitake mushrooms the Veggies giving the perfect sweet flavor to the book Chou broccoli and carrots:)) ad some lemon And cilantro in your broth for perfection
Yummmm"}
{"text":"If your not around Chinatown then they have very good Pho soup, love the chicken noodle"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!! Great service and food quality is top notch. I loved the pineapple curry mmmm delicious my brother clay ate the pad Thai and said he would definitely recommend you should Thai that."}
{"text":"This place is pretty decent. They're broth is good and tasteful. And it's convenient since it's the only phó restaurant on blue diamond pretty much. I always come here for my pho fix."}
{"text":"Some of the best pho I've ever had, as well as great service. Very clean establishment, and the food is always quick and on point! Servers are friendly and on top of things."}
{"text":"Such a good local spot! Food is amazing, pineapple curry is my favorite, and the staff is always really friendly!!"}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite restaurants in town. I usually try something different each time I go since this is an ethnic food I am new to trying.  The Pineapple Curry with chicken has been my favorite so far and has me craving it., but I've never been disappointed in anything. The service is fast and friendly. My to-go orders are always hot and packed well (no spills on the way home). I like supporting small family restaurants; this one definitely deserves our business. I will continue to eat here even though I'm moving and it will be a bit far!"}
{"text":"Really nice family owned Pho place. I was treated to the Thai style beef jerky dish which I cannot remember the name of for the life of me. It was a chewy sort of cooked beef that was reminiscent of beef jerky which I really enjoyed with the sticky rice. As my main meal I had the pho with meat balls, beef, and tendon (which is my favorite) and brings me to the best part of the meal where I take happiness from small details. The greens, sprouts, and lime that came with my pho were super fresh and the limes were HUGE and extremely juicy. Paying attention to details like that make the customer experience awesome for me nothing drives me more crazy then old greens and unjuiceable limes. Loved the meatballs and the tendon. Just wish they were closer to my side of town. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"We love this place!! So much flavor in their broth!! Fast, friendly service. Whenever we are on this side of town, we have to stop and get some pho!"}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant in the area so I thought I would try it out. The food was great. The portions are big, and I couldn't finish my meal, which is very unusual for me. The service was very fast and friendly, my drink never went empty. The food quality was great, and I had the red curry chicken, which I recommend. The atmosphere is a little bland so I give it 4 out of 5 stars. I will definitely be bringing my family here and recommending this place to my friends.  Great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Yum !great customer service!! Looks like I have a new pho spot ! The potstickets r good too!"}
{"text":"My family and I really really really love Pho...so when we saw this location was opening we were so excited.

The first time we visited, it literally took 10 minutes before anyone waited on us. Okay, over looked that. Got our dishes, and all of our broth was lukewarm. And overlooked that.

Moving onto the second visit....
I order the combination Pho. Get to the end of my bowl to find an egg shell in my dish! I called the waiter over to show him that I have an egg shell in my dish (THAT HAS NO EGG IN IT) and he takes my bowl. I thought he took it away to bring me another bowl, but nope he tosses the bowl and then brings the bill!

To add to the insult, he charges me and doesn't even discount or comp the meal!

Which is fine....because I will never return."}
{"text":"Near my house, so stopped for carry-out. Crab rangoons were great, and red curry had a nice flavor. The green beans and peppers added nice dimension to the dish. A nice family place, very friendly staff who seemed happy about working together, and fast service. Restaurant is casual and nothing fancy, but neat as a pin which is what I look for. Will definitely be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"There was a bright green worm that was ALIVE on my plate. I was so hungry and excited to eat here after reading all the great reviews. Now I want to throw up because I almost ate it and it fell off my food onto my napkin! IT WAS MOVING!"}
{"text":"Best thai beef Jerky with sticky rice, no other place compares and I can eat it daily! We also get the red curry chicken which is also very good and my boyfriend gets the rate steak and meatball pho, he loves it! Family owned and operated and it's so close to home. Good find for sure!"}
{"text":"When WTPho first opened, I looked at the first few yelp reviews an most of them were pretty bad, so I didn't even bother to try. Recently, I noticed the average yelp reviews was 4 stars, so I thought that maybe finally there's a good Pho joint near my house. When I came in, I noticed that Pho was the only Vietnamese food on the menu, most other stuff were Thai food. The name WTPho is very misleading, because it gives the impression that it's a viet restaurant.

Anyway, when you go to a restaurant with the word \"Pho\" in their name, you gotta try Pho, right? I ordered the special combo Pho and it came out pretty fast. Once I saw the bowl, I know it was going to be bad even before trying it. The meats looked really old and has a funky smell (usually associated with old cooked meat) with a slide shade green. I took a couple bites just to confirm my suspicion. The broth itself was very bland and has almost no flavor (no star anise or beefy flavor, just a the spiciness from the cinnamon). I was hungry and I couldn't even eat 1 quarter of it. Overall, Pho was bad. 

The two stars were for their customer service and cleanliness. Unless I'm in the mood for some Thai food, I will not come back here for Pho."}
{"text":"Worst customer service. Overpriced underseasoned no flavor. You can go to so many Vietnamese restaurants I don't know why anybody would choose this one over the others every time I go in this place it's dead which tells you everything you need to know about it"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Service is always quick, staff is always friendly and the food is awesome. Their pho is delish -- rich flavor and not too fatty -- and the Thai basil, jalapeños, sprouts and limes are a great addition! [**I am not claiming to be a pho expert, but I, personally, can't tell the difference between this place and any of the places in Chinatown**]  

And for those other diners in tow that may not be on the soup train, (choo choo!) they have a ton of Thai entrees that are great as well. And we CRAVE the Thai Chicken Wings (appetizer) constantly."}
{"text":"The pho is pretty good. We've only ever picked up and never had an issue. We call in and order and they are really friendly and by the time we get there, it's ready to go.  

We usually go to Pho Annie, which used to be our absolute favorite, but the last two times we picked up, the food was not good, so we decided to give WTPho a try and have been pleasantly surprised.  We always just get beef pho with tendon and each time has been great!  

Our first time here, we also got eggrolls, and that's why the 4 stars instead of 5. The eggrolls were so gross. All cabbage and nothing else. Tastes like something you'd get from a low rate Chinese buffet. Never again!  But pho? YES PLEASE!"}
{"text":"I love their yellow curry with chicken. Unfortunately, they have a large menu and I have only tried their curry. BUT, it is delicious!!! The staff is very friendly and I always carry out my meal because they make it very easy. I pick up curry about twice a month. I will be back!"}
{"text":"This review does not factor in customer service.  I ordered takeout, but the staff seemed friendly and welcoming during my short wait time on food.  I did not call ahead and was out in 7 minutes!

My order was simple and straight to the point since I was craving some pho.  I was surprised that the options were very limited when it came to pho, because pho is in the name of the restaurant.  I asked the server about which type of soup was the most popular and went with his recommendation, the \"Beef Combination Noodle Soup.\"

Once home, I opened up my bag and found everything neatly separated.  The broth was still boiling hot and had 3 beef balls thrown in.  The broth was nice and clear, but was lacking richness.  The taste of beef had a very small presence, the broth was dominated by ginger.  Luckily, they provide hoisin sauce, chili sauce, soy sauce and limes for seasoning with your order.  

The rice noodles were perfect.  No complaints there.  Bean sprouts, chopped chives, thinly sliced onion, chopped cilantro and basil leaves are provided as well.  Very fresh.  

The amount of meat provided is small, but no complaints about the quality.  Everything has been cooked in advance with the exception of the rare steak cuts, but it all warms up and cooks a little more if thrown into the broth immediately.

This place is not worth driving across town for, but if you're in the area it's a great alternative to fast food.  This will not be my last visit.

P.S. The menu is mostly Thai which is unexpected as most would assume it to be Vietnamese (myself included)."}
{"text":"Having tried the pho, I wasn't impressed at all.  It taste like it was made from powder.  I also ordered the phad Thai and felt it was overly sweet and sticky.  It was the first time my husband did not finish a bowl of pho and the first time I did not take more than 2 bites of phad Thai."}
{"text":"They only have 3 pho options and some Thai dishes.  I got the yellow curry with chicken which was okay.  My guy got the beef pho. His broth was not very hot and the broth was mediocre.  I may be a white girl but I can make better pho broth than this.  My curry was okay but next time my craving for curry happens I will drive a few miles down the road to pin kow or archies. Service was good tho."}
{"text":"Came back from my Hawaiian vacation and I'm sick as a dog.  I wanted soup and this was close to my house. I wasn't expecting much since it's like a pop up store but I was wrong. The broth was delicious and very flavorful. I got the beef combination. My toddler who is very picky even ate it.  I'm so happy that I don't need to go to Chinatown to get my pho fix and an added bonus is, it's right across Mountains Edge."}
{"text":"What a cute little place! Their pho was fantastic and I loved their crab ragu. Prices were super reasonable too. Service was quick and friendly and our food came out very quick."}
{"text":"Awesome sauce just wish they were open a little later sometimes do I could grab some after work ?"}
{"text":"Me and my partner LOVE this place!! Everything we have tried here is extremely fresh and authentic. The setting is very simple, but that does not bother me. The prices are very reasonable, and the portions are large!! Very clean and very fast service. We eat here at least twice a week. Viva la WTPhó!!"}
{"text":"ok guys real quick. I feel like I've been having some bad luck lately because I'm starting to notice more bad spots coming along in the southwest area. this place really rubs me the wrong way. I was in the mood for pho and was like let's go try this place out. I assumed it was Vietnamese but when I spoke to the server she was Thai and there was Thai food on the menu.. ok nothing wrong with that just threw me off. let's get to the food.

spring rolls(2/5)- was just meh! it was the shabu shabu sesame sauce used for dipping. didn't like it at all. 

beef jerky( 3.8/5)-  served with sticky rice and this was actually pretty good only thing that could've been better was sauce. 

pad see ew shrimp (2/5)- what really turned me off about this was the $12 they charged for this dish. I personally expect this dish to either be done right or you failed in this case you failed. flavor was the main thing here they tried to play safe and make it more sweet than anything.

pho combination and brisket (2.999/5)- I like their pho here. the beef had great marbeling and the tendon was delish. I like how their broth is clear and not greasy but was just a little bland. 

I think this place needs a lot of work to find their niche. I couldn't find myself to give this place a 3 star rating based on their food service was fine but I think for the food we got it was a little pricey. now that I tried this place I'll probably won't eat here again. there's so many better Thai restaurants in Vegas"}
{"text":"Very happy to have visited. Great service. The pho was perfect. This is my place in the SW for a great meal."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The food and service are excellent!  I typically get the chicken basil and papaya salad.  The location is convenient to mountains edge.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The environment is clean and this place is very family oriented. As a first time customer they have greeted my boyfriend and I and told us we were able to chose our own seats. From there our waiter provided us with our menus and asked for our choice of drink(s) right away. The waiter took less than five minutes to bring our drinks and was ready to take our order. Our waiter gave us recommendations and their all time customer favorites, which I really appreciated as she knew it was our first time there. I ordered the Chicken Pho, rolls, and my boyfriend got fried rice with some type of ribs. 

About 15 minutes later we received our order and presentation wise it was nice. However, we received a little bowl of sauce for our rolls and in the middle of our meal I had to hold off to wait about 10-15 minutes for another small bowl of sauce. Taste was okay, it did not stand out to me as much as I would expect it to but it's like any other Pho soup - it satisfies you. Rolls were hot on the outside but a little cold on the inside. My boyfriend's fried rice was good, especially the ribs. The only problem was the cold rolls and wait time to get a small bowl of sauce. 

Costumer service was average, we had different waiters who served our drinks and took our orders, to delivering our food and giving us refills, and someone else giving us the tab. The first person who was our waiter was very nice but as it came to the others, it was not as exciting as our first waiter. The girl who gave us our tab stood over my boyfriend as he signed the receipt (felt weird and a little pressured that she could see what we plan to tip her, etc.) but we left and no one thanked us as we walked out the door. Therefore, this place had its good moments but I will have to give this restaurant a 3 out of 5 due to some of my above reasoning."}
{"text":"Always good food and friendly service. The space is clean.  The garlic chicken and pineapple fried rice are both delicious."}
{"text":"Place was super clean, service was excellent! Being relatively new to Vietnamese food, the staff helped me decide what to order and everything they suggested was DELICIOUS!! I'll be eating here once a week for sure!"}
{"text":"Second time here, the Drunken Noodles are amazing, super clean restaurant and great service!"}
{"text":"Finally got around to stepping out of our comPHOrt zone and came here for dinner. We were immediately greeted by the staff and was told to be seated wherever we wanted to. They're an Asian bistro, so they also offered Thai and Vietnamese cuisine. We were surprised they were limited on drinks because they didn't have Vietnamese coffee available. We settled for their Thai coffee which was  a little sweeter than the Viet coffee. We ordered the rare steak pho and the combination pho, per usual. They offered a good amount of bean sprouts, basil, and lime. In fact, they are more generous with these items than other restaurants. The broth was probably one of thee best I had! It seemed like a cleaner or shall I say \"leaner\" broth and it helped clear my sinuses from Vegas allergies, hehe. The portions for the meat and noodles were more on the \"not so generous\" side since I'm used to not finishing my soup. We were still hungry and wished we order an appetizer too but it's not like we knew the portions were going to be too little. The customer service was okay, nothing too fond to review about. Overall, the broth will be something that'll make me come back and maybe extra meat or an appetizer with my soup."}
{"text":"Pretty good! We ordered pineapple curry, pad Thai, crab rangoons and chicken breast Pho. All were good and veggies were fresh. We'll go back."}
{"text":"Love it here!!!
If you're looking for non-greasy healthy light meal , this is the place to go ."}
{"text":"Best fried ice cream ever and the drunken noodles are delicious!!!!
Staff is friendly and attentive!!!"}
{"text":"Twice, I have attempted to eat here and am not able to get past the rudeness of the person behind the counter.  Her tones and interruptions may be cultural but it would behoove her to be more sensitive to her potential customers whose cultural may be different from hers."}
{"text":"If you close at 9:30 pm and I am standing at the door at 8:45 pm and all of the workers are standing in the restaurant and no one looks up to say we closed early or to acknowledge my presence, you get one star."}
{"text":"Wtpho?! Exactly what I thought when we arrived in the parking lot.

The face front not to much to say about it just looks like a normal business. Inside was nice and clean not too much clutter inside. 

There are numerous flower vases on the counter that look as if they were after thoughts to fill in space- alrighty.. Seating is nice and comfy for the allotted time you need to eat PHO

Food- i was a little confused as I was thinking it was a Vietnamese restaurant but when looking at the menu you discover that it also features Thai offerings. The Pho is tasty for being off the Asian parkway. Thai food needs more authentic flavors. I had the drunken fried rice.. There wasnt enough BAM! BOOM! Thai flavor. No need to tone down the traditional flavors!!! C'mon

The staff is very friendly and quick to assist in any fashion you need. I will return to try more things and to see if this review has made it to the lap of the owners! Good job"}
{"text":"Some of the best pho in town! Went during lunch and service was easy, quick, and the food came out quickly.
Had the BBQ pork pho with egg noodles (love how they serve egg noodles), ginger chicken, and Thai coffee. Everything was great.

The broth here is delicious. Definitely one of the best pho joints in LV, especially in the south side. Pho-kin good. #SorryIHadTo"}
{"text":"Since it was close I tried it again. The Thai beef salad is the best one I've ever had!"}
{"text":"This place is called WTPho, it is 95% Thai menu. I came here for Pho but decided to order Panang curry instead since they seemed to specialize in Thai. It was terrible, the constancy was that of soup broth not like a gravy. 
If you want decent Pho close by go to, Pho Saigon 8 on Rainbow."}
{"text":"I've been sick for days and pho usually is my cure.  I live in Mountains Edge and did not wanna drive to Spring Mountain so I yelp'd this place and figured I'd try it!  It was exceptionally clean in the restaurant.  My server was very pleasant.  And the rare pho was soooo good!  I'd give it five stars but I'm giving four cause a lot of my steak was fatty.  I'll see go back!!"}
{"text":"The Pho here is good! However I did not care for the Thai curry I chose the green curry it was very salty and the flavor tasted very watery I was truly dissapointed. My boyfriend ordered the mixed vegtables with chicken that also wasn't very good but it was better than the curry I had. I tried many Thai places and so far my to go #1 place is Lucki Thai on Silverado!"}
{"text":"When I moved to this side of town I was happy there was a pho shop close by. WTPho is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas i have been to pretty much all of them. They are constant every time I have been there over the last year I have been very satisfied with the bowl of pho. The broth is a perfect balance I love the think sliced brisket. I order extra brisket and noodles I would like a large bowl option but most places don't have that option. The staff is great they are welcoming and friendly I really love coming here. Enjoy"}
{"text":"I only tried the Thai beef jerky (came with Thai style sticky rice! Happily surprised) and spring rolls (noodles were teeny tiny which I am not accustomed to in spring rolls but besides the textural \"difference\" that most people wouldn't notice/be bothered by) I enjoyed the food, need to try some pho soon from here!"}
{"text":"Mountains Edge peeps, never go to spring mtn again. This place is awesome and right in the neighborhood. And, for dessert, real fried ice cream...yum!!!"}
{"text":"2nd time here. I have only ordered pho here. This time I ordered the chicken, shiitake mushroom, and bok choy. (No noodles). I felt so compelled to write this review because the broth was intensely delicious. So much flavor along with the mushrooms was absolutely exquisite! There was nothing else to add to it to \"enhance\" the flavor.  They have a great recipe and I absolutely recommend this place. It is quite far out of the city but worth it. I don't even order a drink because it's that good."}
{"text":"Sometimes yelpers get it wrong. I was skeptical but I tried out based on many + reviews. I so wanted to like this place since it's one of our only few non-fast food joints we have in Mt Edge. Unfortunately this place is by far the worst attempt at Asian food. It's not Asian fusion but Asian-confusion as food here are quite bland, lack of freshness, and leaves flimsy msg taste in your mouth. I feel obligated to write a bad review so maybe I can spare one person at least from making the same mistake as we did. At least it lived up to its name...WTF!"}
{"text":"If you live in mountains edge and you're craving pho do not waste your time on any of the pho places on rainbow. Wtpho is so convenient and delicious! 

Their chicken pho broth is delicious. It has a hint of cinnamon to it that I've never tasted in any other broth but it makes theirs really special. The addition of mushrooms and bok choi in the chicken pho makes it truly delicious. 

I have only tried their pho so I cannot speak to anything else on their menu but I have never been disappointed. I only do pick up orders and I think the majority of their business is that way because the restaurant is never packed when I go in. 

They give a generous portion of all the add ins and a generous serving of protein with your soup. The chicken isn't dry like some of the other pho places I've been to. Try it soon!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Pho place in the southwest!! When my boyfriend and I moved into Mountains Edge, we began searching for a decent Pho place nearby. Our usual spot was in China Town on Spring Mountain and we felt that the drive was just too long and it was always so crowded. While in the midst of our search, and after trying several popular Pho places nearby, we happened upon this gem, WTPho, and all of its deliciousness!! I get their steamed tofu Pho and love their crab rangoons and shrimp spring rolls! I've also had their chicken and mushroom Pho and enjoyed that as well!! The food is always marvelous! The menu provides lots of options for those who are not fans of Pho as well so it's definitely a good place to enjoy with family or friends who have different food preferences!!"}
{"text":"So I got the beef pho and crab ragoons and it was delicious! Definitely had a great experience this time. Will come back more often!"}
{"text":"I came here because I was craving pho .... it was ok not the best I've had. The appetizers were ok as well..: I was hoping the fried egg rolls would be good but they were ok. Also the spring roll had so much noodles and not enough other stuff in it."}
{"text":"Love this place, service is very good . I love the broth it tastes so clean tasting, not too much oil like other places (maybe because the owner is thai ;) the husband and wife owners are so awesome! Def check this place out and try the the other dishes as well"}
{"text":"This is a new restaurants so they are still trying to get thing together but all in all it's great that I don't have to drive all the way to china town for PHO"}
{"text":"Drove by a few times, wanted to eat there.  5 stars all the way for a name like that!"}
{"text":"Ordered the rare stake pho, it was great tasting but not much meat. Service is excellent and the order comes out very quick! Herbs and greens are very fresh! Like the bean sprouts were on point (not brown and soggy). I would say stop by and give it try!"}
{"text":"I'm a part time pescetarian, when I want to be. I usually go for their veggie tofu pho. I like it a lot, isn't too thick. When I feel like having protein, I like to get the combination soup. I love their spring rolls, I'm highly obsessed with their peanut butter sauce!"}
{"text":"Fast to-go service. Clean restaurant. The ingredients are fresh & delicious. The broth was still boiling hot when I got home. I'll definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"My whole experience was very pleasant. The food was amazing. Their Thai iced tea was on point and you could order it with or without boba. My rare steak pho was absolutely delicious. My spring rolls was amazing minus the peanut sauce. it just tasted like they used store bought peanut butter.  but other than that MINOR issue, everything was absolutely delicious"}
{"text":"The pork combination pho is my favorite! Service is great and super fast for take out orders."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's good food close to our house, I'm partial to the Veggie Pho (their mushrooms are amazing!) or the Pineapple Curry (I could eat it twice a week)...Drunken Noodles were also good. Service is quick but delivery during dinner hours is usually delayed 45-60 mins, especially on the weekends. If you are hungry, plan ahead or pick up!"}
