{"text":"There has to be a time when a restaurant either decides to take an item off the menu OR re-evaluates the way it is prepared.  Super Wok 1 needs consider one of those options with the lo-mein.  

Today, I ordered the shrimp lo-mein, which was actually spaghetti noodles with some canned baby shrimp thrown in.  The dish was poorly seasoned, contained broth at the bottom,and barely had any carrots or cabbage in it.  

The lo-mein was a disappointment, so much so that I will not return to Super Wok 1."}

{"text":"This place is the best! Everything is made to order by the owner of the establishment. All authentic food!  Egg Foo Young is the BEST I have ever found, all fresh ingredients. The chicken wings are so fresh and tender. I can never find a wrong here!"}
