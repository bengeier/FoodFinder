{"text":"Friendly, helpful employees, and wonderful vegan food!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place while I was on a job on this side of town since I am gluten and dairy free. They advertised many gluten free, dairy-free/vegan options which is great. There are so many gluten free options lining the counter I didn't even think to check if they had non-gluten free options. I didn't think that I needed to question the ingredients at a place like this. I was wrong. I ordered the special which seemed safe (vegan sausage, gravy, mashed potatoes and veggies). It came out with homemade bread which looked like it was made with regular flour and I realized not everything may be gluten free. I asked the hostess if the bread was gluten free. It wasn't so I said no problem I just won't eat it.  Then she processed to tell me that the gravy has gluten (which I already had a bite of). I was frustrated but she offered to let me look at the menu to see if there is anything else I want. Then came out a minute late to tell me that I would have to pay for a new meal since I did not specify my food allergy before ordering. I politely said I would just leave then. It is unbelievably frustrating to feel like I was at a \"safe\" restaurant only for it not to be. And to state that they are vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free friendly and not help cater to those with allergies. I am now out $17 (not cheap!) and still need to find somewhere to eat lunch while now sick from gluten. I would expect this terrible level of hospitality at a non-allergy friendly place but not from a place that advertises to those with food restrictions."}
{"text":"Well the first time we went the food was great, but slow... today we went for brunch and waited 40+ min for our food! this was ridiculous as the table next to us got their food right after  us but sat down 20 min after us.... no discount offered no real apologies and the portions were tiny. **** the worst offense - selling Non-vegan desserts in their display case! you are supposed to be a vegan place first. No sign on these non-vegan items  to alert vegans not to eat*** We are NOT going back. Shame too, since \"vegan\" places are hard to find. Green and Pomegranate Cafe are way better."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks! I really enjoy the breakfast items, especially the Sweet Potato Hash. They also have excellent rotating flavors of lemonade that is free with a regular food purchase and check in."}
{"text":"Great food! The menu offers a great variety of choices. Having tried both the Hearty Bowl and the Soul-full Bowl and loved it, very filling, very tasty! Love this place."}
{"text":"Tried this place based on the reviews.  Sat and waited 40 minutes for the food.  The only thing that was remotely good was the lemonade.  The pizza was a piece of cardboard with some marinara sauce on it.  The potabello burger did not include a burger and was too spicy to eat.  Skip this place...not worth the $45 I paid for two people to not eat their food."}
{"text":"Delicious vegan options! Wonderful service and even though food can be a bit slow when it's busy, it's definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"This was new find for me and right down the road from work...roasted veggie sandwich was amazing...veggie pozole was excellent...reasonable prices and friendly staff...it's a keepr"}
{"text":"I wanted to give more stars but the customer service is lacking.  My order that I called in arrived wrong.  I was offered only a refund and told their chef misread ticket due to their lunch rush. I was also informed they could remake it if I would be willing to wait with no refund. Their apology and a promise next time to get it right according to manager is the best she can offer."}
{"text":"Love this place for breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks           or coffee/tea.  They have it all! I have tried most of their menu and my favorite vegan dishes are breakfast pizza or burrito and bruschetta board. Even though this is vegetarian restaurant, some of the dishes can be made with dairy, please specify if you are a vegan to ensure they dont make the mistake and put cheese your pizza.  Great selections of teas ,smoothies and freash juices....pure love! They also have some pretty tasty baked goodies !!!"}
{"text":"First time here. Maybe coffee is not their thing. My Americano was terrible. Couldn't drink it. I like supporting places like these rather than hitting up Starbucks for my caffeine fix. Too bad."}
{"text":"Love, love, love. We have just moved in to the neighborhood behind the restaurant, and it is awesome to have a place that offers such great food that I can eat without having to question how it's made. Delicious food and creative recipes. The only reason I didn't give the last star is because it's a tad on the pricey side, but I get why - a place like this has to do what they need to do to stay in business. Don't hesitate though - go!"}
{"text":"A vegan paradise! If you want amazing delicious food that's good for your soul made by truly wonderful people then this is the place for you! Highly recommend this cafe, even if your not vegan, this place will show you that healthy food is YUMMY!!!"}
{"text":"Loved it. Great food, our normally picky kids ate their fill too, which is a first for a vegan place. Staff was friendly, atmosphere is quaint. Great place!"}
{"text":"If you like healthy tasteful food this is the place to go it cateres to vegan and meat eaters. A little pricey but I've never been disappointed it's always made perfectly. I don't think they have a bad dish in the menu."}
{"text":"Yummy! Yummy! Yummy! Creative & delicious vegan & vegetarian soups, burritos, burgers, pizza, et. al. Smoothies, tea, organic coffee are served. My wife and I have eaten here twice and thoroughly enjoyed all each and every entree and soup. Smoothies are on my must-try list."}
{"text":"Great dinner at a really good price.  The black bean chili was wonderful, a great blend of spices and fresh tastes.  The gluten free corn bread was just right to match the chili.  For dessert we had a chocolate cupcake (OMG it was as good as my grandma's) and a Gluten free chai spice cupcake with a maple flavor.  They did it up right.  The service was attentive, efficient plus they smiled and actually enjoyed helping their customers.  As an added benefit they brought out a purple and orange 360 degree Arizona sunset that blasted through their huge windows.  Amazing and since it was Saturday evening, we got in on a fun jam session too.  We will go back and you should too."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place because I had heard it was good. I got a roasted vegetable sandwich and my husband ordered cauliflower wings and a pizza. We were disappointed in everything we got. It was not that it was really bad food, it was just that the food was boring and not worth the money we spent on it."}
{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere. The one thing I love the most is walking in when they are making their pizza sauce. By far the best. It was definitely a happy accident to find out they make pizza even though it's not yet on the menu. Ask them about them, they are fantastic. If you're looking for gluten free, vegan, or organic food and pretty fair pricing this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Oh man, first of all I am soooo happy there is finally a place like this in the east valley. Second, it's amazing! The atmosphere is super cute and welcoming, the staff is friendly and helpful, and the food... Holy crap, yum! So far, the tacos duo and the burrito are both incredible. I'll definitely be back to try more since pretty much everything on the menu sounds delicious. Oh and if you like peanut butter & jelly they have an awesome cupcake!"}
{"text":"Don't mean to sound crass but this shit is good.  Its \"lit\". Its \"fire\". You feel me dawg?  In all seriousness its some of the best vegan food in AZ.  The biscuits and gravy doesn't disappoint, especially with the amount of gravy portions compared to other places.  Bacun wrap with baked fries is the way to go.  Come get fat and feel good."}
{"text":"Got the black bean burger. $11.75. It was pretty good. Nothing amazing. Pita jungle has a bean burger that's like $9 and better... I like supporting the cause and I wish there were more vegan chains around but this is just too pricey for it being just alright ... I wish I was more impressed."}
{"text":"This place was the bomb. Good food, pleasant people, and chill atmosphere. I'd eat there again and again whenever I visit AZ."}
{"text":"Very things we ate was great  Protein bowl  Portabello burger   Gluten free raspberry cupcake"}
{"text":"Food is decent. Customer service is the worst. Employees are unfriendly and have no personality. We had to wait an inappropriate amount of time for two children's quesadillas and 2 protein bowls. Person at the register was inattentive and didn't process my order correctly. When the order came out wrong, she was unapologetic and did nothing to make amends."}
{"text":"Great vegan food. I've decided that this is a very healthy choice for lunch and dinner when eating out. All their ingredients appear very fresh and expertly prepared. They also serve great juice blends and coffees, so this can also be a great place to hang out for a quick snack.  Staff were super friendly. You can pay by card using Square on a cool swivel iPad. This place is really in tune with the modern age on many levels.  Highly recommended if you're looking for healthy eats before heading over to see a movie at Harkins Superstition Springs, just down the road."}
{"text":"What a relief, finally a good coffee shop in east mesa. I had the Santa Monica (something new to me, kinda like a sweet biscuit soaked in orange juice served with  fresh fruit) and my wife had the breakfast sandwich (english muffin, pesto, avocado, tomato, and tofu) both were awesome. They use quality ingredients with both their food and coffee and serve homemade pastries and bread. Can't wait to try their lunch. Very friendly service too."}
{"text":"What a beautiful feeling, being able to have biscuits and gravy cruelty free, organic and made with organic ingredients.  I loved that I could enjoy a beer with my food.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is great. My husband and I are vegan and he has a gluten intolerance. It is usually hard to find food options at restaurants. This is the only place we've found where both of us can eat nearly every single thing on the menu. And the food is wonderful. Even the gluten free bread used for sandwiches is great. The staff is knowledgable and helpful if you have questions or food preferences. Plus they let you sample stuff if you are iffy on something."}
{"text":"The Refreshing homemade lemonade and walnut tacos were so delicious! I was more than satisfied but I couldn't resist leaving without at least taking one of their desserts. I chose a chocolate raisin oat cookie that might as well have been called a monster cookie because I could have shared it. But instead saved half for later. Everything was fresh and made with love! Cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My husband, daughter and I ate dinner here last night. The protein bowl was yummy - even for a non - vegetarian like me. Couscous, avocado, walnuts, quinoa, black beans and fresh salad greens.  Even the confirmed carnivore (hubby) thoroughly enjoyed it.  Wish we had a cafe like this closer to home.  Vegan red velvet cupcake was delicious according to my daughter."}
{"text":"Great, fresh, creative food. Gracious people, too: I arrived four minutes before closing last night, and the staff were all happy for me to stay, sit down, and eat. The lentil soup was fresh and obviously made that day; the cucumber salad flavorful and crunchy, and the walnut \"beef\" tacos delicate and delicious."}
{"text":"Loved it!  Coming from a place in the US where \"vegan\" is sometimes considered to be an affliction, rather than a choice of food, etc., it is nice to have actual vegan places to eat.  I absolutely loved the food.  Had to try a sweet for dessert as well...and then I wanted to buy all of them and take them home with me.  *sigh*  Neither my waistline nor my pocketbook would allow that, so I will just have to return another day."}
{"text":"I love this place! Not only is the food so fresh and delicious every time, but the staff and service is incredible! Everyone is so friendly and helpful :)  I love coming here with friends and family because it's a guaranteed great experience! Absolutely recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Best vegan/vegetarian restaurant! Love the food! Especially the pizza! The desserts are fabulous too! We come weekly."}
{"text":"Love this place Everytime I go! They have yet to fail me. Great taste, service & presentation. It's pricey for sure but worth every penny for the quality. We need more places like this!"}
{"text":"Walnut tacos?  Really?  The girl at the counter highly recommended them so I gave it a try. And wow am I glad I did. They had just the right taco flavor and went very well on the corn tortilla, tomatoes and cilantro. Had the blue corn chips and salsa with them. My teen daughter had the pizza with basil carrots and spinach and almost finished it all which is rare for her. She loved it and I loved that she actually ate something that was so healthy. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant stands out from the rest in Mesa.  Really good and healthy food, good value, not a chain.  Good coffee.  Good place for a casual meal.  I had some roasted veggies and the french toast.  Definitely will come back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I will go back to this cute place. It's out of my way, but I'll drive for good vegan food. My opinion is that they need time to adjust. Phoenix knows about Pomegranate, which put the bar high. A little more creativity in the menu, a warmer interior, a more efficient service, and this place will rock soon. And i'll enjoy it better then."}
{"text":"I wanted to stop in here for breakfast this morning, but they don't open until 11:00.  :(  I ate dinner here a couple of weeks back and it was truly exceptional. The number of vegan options was wonderful as normally I am trying to modify dishes to make them vegan.   I hope that one day they decide to open earlier because those baked goods would be very tasty with some coffee right about now."}
{"text":"We meet my parents here every so often for breakfast. It feels too far to visit more frequently, even though it's only 20 min away. Anyway, the food is SO GOOD! I usually get the Tofu Scramble Breakfast Bowl which is lovely and leaves me feeling healthy. Today my husband and I split the Biscuits and Gravy and the Breakfast Pizza. Again, SO GOOD! The biscuits and gravy had that wonderfully peppery taste you'd expect. The biscuits were fluffy and light; just perfection! The pizza was made with similar gravy (lightly applied like a sauce), scramble, potatoes, avocado. Super tasty. My parents always get the French toast and thoroughly enjoy it. My husband loves the French press coffee.    The only negative is it takes some time to get your food because they cook it when you order. But that's only a half-star annoyance.   Bottom line: best vegan breakfast in Mesa. Keep up the good work, Cutting Board!!"}
{"text":"This place though....absolutely amazing! I love it there and the food. I tell you, the person that took the time to create this atmosphere is amazing."}
{"text":"Currently addicted to the dirty chai latte with coconut milk. Definitely check this place out for good coffee and a well rounded vegan menu."}
{"text":"Absolutely in love with this place. Delicious vegan food and great atmosphere. I would give more than five stars if I could."}
{"text":"I understand that \"good, real food takes time\" but over an hour for a half sandwich and cup of soup? That's ridiculous.   Apparently the long wait time is normal- so keep that in mind."}
{"text":"It's very difficult to find good vegan food in Mesa and I want to like this place so badly but I just can't.   I went in on a Wednesday during lunch with 2 friends and we all ordered the bowls to go. We waited about 30 minutes before I asked if our food might be ready any time soon. It was out shortly after and the waitress told us it's usually like this so next time we might want to call ahead. What? What kind of an excuse is that? So waiting 30+ minutes for your food is standard at this place?? And the solution is to call ahead?   Then when we got back to school my friends bowl had white rice subbed for brown. When she called to ask they told her they ran out and just made the substitution without her knowledge. They assured her next time they would inform her before.   As for the food, it was pretty meh. Even the hot sauce was bland.   It's a shame as I do really try to support vegan/vegetarian places. Usually I can deal with bad customer service or mediocre food, but not both."}
{"text":"The best place to get organic vegan/vegetarian food! Peaceful, welcoming, wholesome and delicious. The staff and owners Sean and Krystal go out of their way to make sure you are satisfied with your order. Will be coming here a lot more!!!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch one day because I forgot to bring mine and this place was very nice the staff was very kind and the food was very delicious. It's hard finding places to eat that have vegan items, not to mention tasty menu selections. I will definitely be coming back here again."}
{"text":"I love this place! I work next door and have been trying to lose weight so whenever I don't bring my own lunch I go here. I've only had a few things on the menu but everything I've had is amazing! The staff is super friendly too"}
{"text":"Excellent fresh food, well prepared and served with a friendly smile. If you're a fan of healthy, organic food that also tastes great this is the place. Very happy to have found it in the culinary wasteland of Mesa. Finally don't have to drive to Scottsdale to find a meal that tastes great and isn't full of chemicals, hormones, antibiotics and pesticides. Plus a good gluten free selection was the icing on the cake. You don't have to be trying to eat healthy to enjoy dining here. It just plain tastes good."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Had the \"bacon\" wrap and coleslaw. Yummy! Wanted the wrap since visiting the booth at the vegan festival.  It is really big and had to bring the other half home.  Already planned what I will try next!"}
{"text":"This place was only ok. I felt like everything I had here I could open my fridge and make in about ten minuets but the food took over 30 minuets to get. I saw several other people waiting for food here as well if your in a hurry don't go here!"}
{"text":"This place is fresh, delicious, a little pricey but fabulous!  The breakfast pizza is my favorite!!!"}
{"text":"Just came across this place on a restaurant search ap this morning and wanted to give it a try. I could easily end up becoming a regular here. We went for breakfast, but they also have lunch and have recently added dinner. Oh, and they do Take and Bake pizza on top of that! I had the tofu scramble and my partner had the French toast. Both were amazing. We split a freshly baked vegan cinnamon roll with our coffee for dessert. Unbelievably sweet and tasty. It was pretty quiet this morning so there was no waiting and plenty of time for the owner to share lots of info about The Cutting Board, the menu, ingredients, plans for the future etc..  The food came out in a reasonable amount of time by a friendly server who was also able to explain some of the details of my scramble. I didn't recognize some of the micro greens on top so she clued me in. I was nosy with the table near us and those folks shared that the breakfast burrito and the tofu tamari English muffin were also really good. Cleanliness matters to me and this place was spotless. We noticed they had a few outside tables and a water bowl for dogs. Thinking next time will bring the boys. Okay, my Take and Bake pizza is almost ready. Hope it is as good as breakfast was."}
{"text":"This place offers some realy tasty items that reflect what one must eat for true health.  Everything is fresh and well made. Not covered in oil. High quality ingredients full of flavor. Just absolutely delicious! One of my favorite vegan spots!"}
{"text":"One of few vegan places in Mesa. Their menu has been hit or miss for me, the staff is friendly but they take a long time for orders. The price is not worth it for vegan food in comparison to the rest of the valley. They do however have a great atmosphere and whole ingredients. This place is close to Emmy work so if I'm really craving some vegan food I'll stop by, but it' always ends up closer to $20 for a meal when I'm only buying for me."}
{"text":"Really quaint, tasty spot! We visit every year (have family in the area) & our first stop is always here as the vegan options in the area are lacking really except for the Cutting Board. I love love love their walnut tacos, very inventive & can't find them anywhere else - Super tasty & great consistency! Their vegan pasta salad is also really darn good as is their Vedg-Head sandwich with the best hummus I've ever had (Cilantro flavored! Whaaat?) Can't wait to come back to Cutting Board next year!"}
{"text":"Great vegan restaurant in the East Valley! First off, this location is great for people who live in gilbert, east mesa, or queen creek! The atmosphere is very nice and cozy, perfect for hanging out with family or friends, but also peaceful enough to study or relax. The bowls and salads here are awesome! But, my absolutely favorite thing to get here are the buscuits and gravy! INCREDIBLE!! The cheesecakes and other desserts are also very, very yummy! Last but not least, staff is always so friendly and helpful!  Been coming here for years now, definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"If I could give more than 5 stars I would. I have been a vegan for a long time. I have eaten at SO MANY vegetarian/vegan places and I have to say this is probably the best I have ever been to. The happy hour prices are great. $3.50 for a glass of wine?? THANK YOU. The Buffalo wings are easily the best thing I have ever eaten. The pizza crust was freakin awesome. Thank you for the great food and great service!"}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant. Really, really good food using local ingredients! Little on the expensive side."}
{"text":"We were so happy to find a vegan restaurant nearby.  The owners are so friendly and the food is outstanding and so fresh.  We've been back several times and have always been impressed with the service and the quality of the food.  Not boring fare at all!  They even have entertainment sometimes.  It's a fun date for my husband and I."}
{"text":"This place is right around the corner from our home so I was hoping for something good. Ordered a black coffee with almond milk and a cookie that was at the register. It took over 15 minutes. The coffee was good, no complaints there. The cookie was.... interesting, my 1 year old enjoyed it enough. My 4 year old spit it out. The kicker - with no cost listed i assumed it was in the dollar range... $4?? For a bad cookie? The time spent waiting for a plain coffee + a $4 cookie"}
{"text":"The food is amazing!!  We ate the cauliflower wings, stuffed mushrooms, grilled veggie sandwich, blackbean soup, and the burrito with baked fries. So good and vegan/plant based eating. Only bummer is that the kitchen ran out of items, such as happy hour Wine, happy hour beer, and vinegar for mushrooms (still amazingly good).  When you first walk in, don't be deceived by the beverage and smoothie menu on the wall, they have a full breakfast, lunch, happy hour, and dinner menu to choose from.    I would give them 4.5 stars!!!  We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"My fav is a date bar  . Omgosh, so good! When entertaining g vegetarians and or vegans I. Always suggest this place. They have local entertainment quite often. Just adds to the flavor felt oragamic. The pizza is delish too.  Black bean crust, you gotta try. But frankly the pizza is only for one. Not really enough for two.  Unless your other only want one slice."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place. Been going here for a long time now and I LOVE the food. The staff is always kind and the menu has something for everyone. The environment is lovely and you can tell they have a great number of regulars. Fresh, delicious and local ingredients.. if I could afford to eat here daily I would. Their baked goods are always tempting too!"}
{"text":"So excited I found this! Cozy place, super friendly service and I tried the salted caramel latte and a double chocolate coconut muffin! Yum! Will definitely come again soon!"}
{"text":"Wow.... I am impressed. The food was crazy good!! I even feel better!! Shows you the power behind NUTRITION!!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly owner, friendly staff and great food. There's a variety of food options, smoothies and sweets, it's always hard to decide because it all sounds good, I want to order the whole menu sometimes"}
{"text":"I finally got a yelp account and have wanted to write a review for almost a year. I hope they are under new management. I ordered a pick up order and it was before work so I could eat something good and healthy and when I ordered the women said 20 minutes. I then got there and she said it will be right out. I waited another 20 minutes in the building. I was late to work. I was very upset that I was told 20 minutes over the phone then having to wait another 20 minutes once I got there when it should have been ready right when I arrived. I waited a total Of 40 minutes. They let me Sit there with no one coming up to me saying it should be out soon or would you like a drink on us for this wait. Nothing. And then once I got the food it was disgusting. I love vegan vegetarian friendly foods and that's what I was going for but they put way to much cabbage since it's a cheap green, horribly presented. I was so annoyed with this situation I couldn't call because I would have been mean. I then started to hate the cutting board and didn't even want a refund because how dare you stupid kid tell me I have to wait a total of 40 minutes for something that isn't even cooked it was a cold dish. I still have some money on my gift card and I really don't want to use it but if the store has a different staff I'll try it again but I still can't believe the food I was given with the wait time. Idiots will run your business into the ground."}
{"text":"I agree with the comment below mine, definitely should get a better sign to emphasize the organic, raw, vegan food. I was looking for this place for a couple days, and kept driving right past it because all I saw was CAFE.  Have to admit my first meal was ok, It was the sweet potato hash. The avacados were perfectly ripe, crisp green tomatoes, but the sweet potatoes were not cooked through and not seasoned well at all. I will definitely give this place another go, but was kinda disappointed.  It happens though I'm sure it was a one time deal. The green juice was fantastic! Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great place to take a break from Starbucks. Yummy coffee options, as well as fresh and healthy food. They have many vegan options which is great for anyone who needs those menu items. Great niche spot!"}
{"text":"Good food. Just moved to Apache Junction so very glad that there's a place serving primarily vegan options close by for when I need something quick. Menu has a decent variety of options and the food was tasty. They also have gluten free options (which hopefully they'll expand ) for those of us that prefer to stay away from it.  Been a few times now. Has been hit or miss with some menu options. Ordered a bowl and it was very bland, ordered a plate of hummus and veggies for 5.95 which is not bad but received enough hummus for about 1/4 of the veggies and used it sparingly as well so this was disappointment. Also noticed that they're using non organic ingredients from tomatoes, tomato sauce, oranges, grapefruit just to name a few from what I could see laying about. Makes me question how much of the menu is organic and makes me scared to eat some things. The prices are very expensive for being not entirely organic.  Well ate here again. Many times since last update vitally but only because it's the only vegan spot out here not for quality. Way overpriced. Anyways, we got burgers both were burnt and dry as dog food. Got side of fries but only one of us got ketchup. Oh and no more lemonade???? Wtf. Some other nasty carbonated drink. $5 for a single basic cupcake??? Really? I could go to a high end bakery and pay $2.50.  Called just after 11 to order tofu sandwich which is served o my u til 11. They would t flex at all. Finally got downgraded to 1 star. Idk why we keep going here. Guess because it's the only overpriced vegan spot that's close to AJ. Guess I won't be giving my 40 bucks to them today.  PLEASE STOP USING PLASTIC TO GO BAGS!"}
{"text":"It's probably my fault, I shouldn't have relies on a restaurant to make me food. I don't believe the process was followed correctly, I want cleaner food. Just slapping labels on food doesn't make it vegan. Nice try."}
{"text":"The food exceeded expectations! Great recommendation for anyone looking for a veggie oasis in Arizona! Excellent food with friendly service."}
{"text":"This place is incredibly creative, the food was amazing and I enjoyed everything I ordered. I recommend the hummus platter and buffalo style cauliflower for appetizers. I look forward to coming here again. I think having more organic ingredients would set this place on top of the podium, even though it cost more for the customer it's worth it at least in my opinion. That aside , this is really nice lace to have lunch or dinner. The owners are very nice they keep a clean kitchen and dinning room. Don't forget to try the cookies they are amazing."}
{"text":"Nice place inside but I did not order anything since the girl at the register was extremely unhelpful and borderline rude when I asked her a question about a menu item. After that I was put off and chose not to order anything. My friend ordered the Taco Duo and said it was bland bland bland. Sorry Cutting Board, we won't be back."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now.  The first time I tried the black bean and brown rice burrito.  Unfortunately, it had no flavor and was very dry, I'd give it 2 stars.  The next go-round I tried the portobello burger which I thought deserves 4 stars.  Service was acceptable (nothing remarkable, but adequate), overall I think it deserves a 3 star rating."}
{"text":"First off, the cutting board is the bomb, Ron Swanson would walk out with a smile. I am not vegan, I eat many vegan meals to accommodate my boyfriends diet.  For more perspective, our 10 year old picky eater actually asks to come here.  Third, it's been a struggle adjusting to the dining options in Mesa coming from downtown Phoenix and I am so damn glad we found this place.  The atmosphere and staff are lovely, the menu has a great variety, and they execute every order with care. Their vegan coleslaw is the best slaw I have ever had, and I am really disappointed that that rotated it out, (please bring it back). I find myself craving the \"veg-head\" sandwich (again, strange for a cheese loving carnivore). Those are probably my favorite dishes, but their other sandwiches, breakfast options, burritos/enchilidas are all delicious. I also tend to be a coffee snob, and theirs is really good. Best of all, they serve alcohol, and have tons of card and board games. Try it out!"}
{"text":"Wow! Wonderful healthy vegan food is finally making it's way to E Mesa! I normally have to drive to Scottsdale to get food this good and healthy and organic. Now I just have to drive a few miles! My friends love this place too!"}
{"text":"It was a warm Saturday afternoon in April... Just kidding.   My wife and I came here to try it out as we are not total vegans but this place was terrific!  The service was great, ambience was chill and food was delicious. They take great care with preparing the food so give yourself some time to get your food. Be patient!  We got the veggie sandwich and the BB burrito and both were top notch. We got sides of chips salsa and coleslaw. The fresh squeezed lemonade will make you want to smack your mama!  JK again...but seriously try this place and you will not be disappointed!  Enjoy and eat well!"}
{"text":"This place is cool. Great atmosphere very clean and super friendly staff. I tried the breakfast pizza and was excited at the beautiful presentation with bright colors of green avocado when first brought out. The pie is so big I had to take half of it home and left the place very full. Was the best vegan pizza I've ever had and will come back to try something different on the menu."}
{"text":"It's hard to find much originality in a town with endless stucco strip malls but this was a great hidden gem. Everything was so fresh. They were even growing fresh veggies in front of the restaurant. Loved the breakfast pizza and the fruit bowl was generous. Wish I could come back and try a few more menu items. Maybe next year!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. WAY over priced for what you get. My wife is a very healthy eater and we found this on yelp. The food was under cooked as well. Their baked fries tasted ok but weren't even cooked all the way through.   A friend of ours bought a side salad that was the size of her hand. We'll never go back and will never refer anyone there."}
{"text":"This place has had consistently amazing and fresh food every single time we have visited. All their items are affordable and you definitely get your money's worth. The staff are all great as well."}
{"text":"Amazing fresh clean food! Pizza is my fav! You have to try their muffins and cupcakes. Fantastic! Their kitchen Manager is the bomb.com"}
{"text":"The peaches and cream lemonade is AMAZING. I Also had the iced vanilla bean latte with homemade almond milk and it was very delicious !!"}
{"text":"I waited to write this review until I had been here several times and  with  different friends.  All have agreed this is a repeat restaurant!  I ordered the hearty bowl (they have 3 bowls to pick from) with brown rice, sweet potatoes, hummus, carrots and different seasonal vegetables, a beautiful mixed green on top with a delicious lime vinaigrette!  Friends have ordered the different soups, (often gluten free) and all have been very good.  They also have some beautiful pizzas (not gluten free).  They  have delicious gluten free cupcakes as well as gluten containing sweets.  Go early for the amazing gluten free version though as they run out quickly.  For those of you who enjoy a drink they have a nice beer selection and some wines.  They even have some gluten free beers to pick from and you can check their hours for happy hour.  This is the type of restaurant where you order at the counter and grab your napkins and silverware then they bring your food to the table.  If your looking for delicious healthy options for dining don't miss this restaurant.  I highly recommend it and will return often!"}
{"text":"This place is so good I had to write an update.  Once you have the Pumpkin Spice Latte with the homemade Almond Milk you'll never go back to Starbucks.  They use real pumpkin in it and it's perfect and not overly sweet like Starbucks one.  And trust me I used to love Starbucks Pumpkin Spice until I had this and realized what I was missing.  Next time you are in the area give it a try,  don't think you'll regret it."}
{"text":"This is the only vegan restaurant in my area and I'm so grateful it's the bomb.com! Hits the spot time and time again. I haven't had anything that I didn't love and it really helps that I can take my non vegan boyfriend here to enjoy himself as well.. the desserts are always 5 star and I kid you not they have THE BEST gluten free bread on the planet."}
{"text":"Great little spot. It's not super pricey but it's not cheap either. A smoothie and a scone came to $13.64 before tip. The price point definitely makes a difference from becoming a daily spot on my way to work.  But here's why I keep coming back. The food is great. I mean really really yummy and good for you. Plant-based whole ingredients, and always tastes great, never super greasy. The people are great and are always willing to answer any questions. Their sauces for coffees and lattes are made from scratch and are vegan. I feel like I've tried mostly everything from the regular menu and I haven't yet been disappointed.   They also have happy hour specials, live music on certain days and all kinds of fun."}
{"text":"It seems like this establishment has either 5-star lovers or 1-star haters, so I wanted to check it out myself. Went for dinner on a Monday night and the line was short, the food came out quickly, and the young man who brought out our food was extremely pleasant and friendly. We ordered the  007 Black Bean Burger ($11), buffalo cauliflower wings ($9), roasted vegetable wrap ($11), and bottle of cider ($6). We both upgraded to the soup for $2.00 extra each. The price for each main item seems a bit steep, but I feel like most healthy plant based restaurants have similar prices so I guess I can't complain. I was disappointed in the wings since I usually love this dish; they weren't bad, but I've definitely had better. I'll probably skip this next time. But, if you'd rather have more \"cauli\"-flavor than \"buffalo\" then order these! I was a huge fan of my veggie wrap; the pesto flavor isn't overpowering and pairs well with the chipotle wrap. The soup was hearty, flavorful, and not overly salty. I took a bite of my husbands burger and it was delightfully spicy from the jalapenos. However, fair warning that this is not the kind of non-meat burger that has the same texture and taste as meat. It's still good, but it's very different. I don't think I'll personally order it next time, but I'll definitely be back to try some other menu items like the bowls or pizza (fingers crossed its not daiya cheese..). Overall, if you're looking for a healthy meal, try this place out for yourself because the opinions out there are wide and varied."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!! I have been visiting Mesa, AZ from Los Angeles this past week and discovered this organic gem!!  In this healthy food desert (not many healthy places to eat in Mesa), I have found bliss!!  My mom loves it too!  Please support this family owned restaurant. You can tell they do it out of love and with love."}
{"text":"My tamari tofu english muffin was delicious! I also enjoyed the salted caramel expresso I got. There were out of the quiche wedge which was disappointing but my english muffin was so delicious I am excited to go back to try the quiche and get another salted caramel coffee!"}
{"text":"My Weight Watchers friend and I had breakfast at The Cutting Board yesterday and we both loved it! My tofu breakfast sandwich was delicious and the pour-over Nicaraguan coffee exceeded my expectations. The customer service was outstanding and the fresh cut flowers on every table a nice touch. I'm definitely returning for more."}
{"text":"Very overpriced for what you get. The food was not very good...the wrap I got literally only tasted like mustard. We ordered chips and salsa with our meal and they gave us a tiny cup of salsa and mosty broken chips and crumbs...dissapointed and won't go back. There are much better vegan places in the valley."}
{"text":"Delicious oatmeal and cupcakes! I had a latte with coconut milk that was good too. I've read service is a little slow and that is true when ordering food, especially on the weekend. Last time I came was a Tuesday around 9 am and my latte was ready quickly."}
{"text":"Great food!  Friendly service!!  We are not vegan and absolutely loved it!!  We look forward to going again!"}
{"text":"So freaking good. I love this place, I got the mighty bowl today and it made me so happy. My only complaint is that this place isn't in Scottsdale.  I definitely will go whenever I'm in Mesa."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this restaurant, if nothing else because they keep their food true and healthy, and you don't need to worry about what ingredients are in your order.  The food is delicious everytime, especially their soups and pizza! Their staff is always professional.  Would recommend them to anyone."}
{"text":"I had a kale salad with the ranch dressing which was a cashew-based dressing. It was delicious! Not as big as I would have liked but tasted fresh.  I also tried the Postino soup and the sweet potato and black bean quinoa soup. Both were great! Will definitely be back when I'm out this way!"}
{"text":"Oh emmm geeeee!!! I didn't know what I was walking into. I looked up coffee shops and this place popped up. I saw they had food and I tried the hearty bowl and a latte. Yummy they make the almond milk in house as well as pretty much everything. They are very welcoming."}
{"text":"Great vegan and vegetarian options. Diverse menu for anyone's taste. The hydroponic plant structure is pretty awesome as well."}
{"text":"I was so thrilled to see a vegetarian place in the East Valley. I love Pomegranate Cafe in Ahwahtukee so I was hoping Cutting Board Cafe would a nearby alternative. No such luck.  My husband and I tried Cutting Board Cafe for an early lunch. He had the black bean burger. He though the burger was ok, but he liked the tamari tofu english muffin that I got better. I liked my dish, and I was impressed with the heirloom tomatoes and micro greens on top. The avocado and pesto were great toppings.I did think it was a bit salty though, and my body agreed. I was parched for water the rest of the day.  I did take out on my second visit so I could have something healthful to bring to work. I went with the lentil cabbage wrap thinking it would be modeled after the super tasty spicy lentil wrap from Trader Joe's. The wrap has huge and came with chips and salsa. It was $6 which seemed like a good value. I started with the salsa which I found slightly off-putting. It tastes like they use lemon juice instead of lime for the acidity. The wrap itself was awful. The overall flavor was overwhelmingly sour, and the lentils were undercooked. I had four bites and tossed it in the trash. This is extremely rare for me because I hate wasting food.   It was such a disappointing experience that I don't want to risk wasting more food with a return visit."}
{"text":"I love having a vegan respite when visiting family in Mesa. Their Hearty Bowl is so good and filling and comforting. Also try it with their cashew based ranch dressing!"}
{"text":"New fan of the Cutting Board!  This was my first visit. I love meat but I'm also Gluten Free and I've always liked Vegan and Vegetarian. The Cutting Board has a fresh approach with a 'Whole Foods Cuisine' that is also very Local, Organic, Vegan and Vegetarian.  My Five year old son had the Taco Duo. I've never known a pickier eater. If it doesn't look Great (to a five year old!!) he won't even taste it. I held him hostage with his request for a Cookie but he devoured a taco and ate most of the chips and salsa. This was truly amazing for him.  I had the soul-full salad. Lots of ingredients I've not seen in a salad before but it really worked!! All Fresh, Whole and Organic!!!  Also had the Raw Cheesecake (GF and dairy free), Robert had the chocolate cookie and let me taste it. And I brought a Date bar home.  Can wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Awesome lunch today with my daughter.   We split the protein bowl and duo tacos.  AMAZING!!! We even purchased a jar of hot sauce and salsa.  Love the staff, food concept and just sitting, chatting with my daughter watching the rain."}
{"text":"Definitely on the pricey side but we loved everything we got here! We've tried the sweet greens fresh juice, roasted veggie sandwich, and the date bar (all delicious!) they aren't kidding when they say \"good food takes time\" though, as it does take longer than most restaurants to get your food (or juice) out to you. Other than that this is a cute little place!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!  Great food.  Great service. An altogether well packaged gift to the east valley.  Please get out & support them!"}
{"text":"Great food. Who knew vegetarian (or are they vegan?) food would be so good?!?! Have been back a couple of times and plan to return again."}
{"text":"This is my special place. The food is some of the best--vegan or not. I feel like it's made with love and that always makes the difference.  The first time I visited TCB, I tried the Santa Monica French Toast and Tamari Tofu English Muffin and I don't know which was better!  As a vegan, you don't always get tasty and healthy but with these two options, they were one in the same!  I also spent my first Mother's Day there and loved that they took the time to make the moms feel special by giving out free flowers!  The service is always great, the ambiance is nice and serene with a killer playlist softly playing.  If I had one critique it's the distance it is from my place, otherwise, I'd live there!"}
{"text":"For a meat lover I actually really enjoyed this place! Honestly I'm not even veggie obsessed. How I ended up here for lunch is a mystery to us all...   I got the Veg Head Sandwich (comes with blue chips and salsa). It was great! The cucumber and jicama made it extra crunchy and the hummus and guac made it feel filling. It didn't feel like I was eating a veggie sandwich but I still got to feel super healthy afterwards... and actually felt full!   I wish this place had a wider selection of options, but I'd be back for those rare times when I feel like being healthy."}
{"text":"Okay, I might be spoiled with vegan food in the Bay Area or have ordered the wrong thing, but the bowl I ordered was plain, tasteless and I was turned off by seeing loads of canned food on the back, not too fresh. The juice was good. Wouldn't go again but enjoy the fact I had this option close to where I was going."}
{"text":"Honestly, I think this place is amazing. I have eaten here twice in once week and their vegan pizza is one of the best I have ever had. I cannot imagine anyone coming here and not enjoying the food unless their pallet is out of whack! Keep up the great work and I will continue to be a customer!"}
{"text":"The tofu scramble was delish. I also had the salted caramel latte w/soy which was way better than starbucks. I could only finish half my dish so i took the rest home and got a lemon cupcake to go. Mever had a vegan pastry before. It was quite good. I tried a bite of my friends cinnamon roll. I will hav to go back for that. She enjoyed her chai tea latte it wasnt too sweet. We will definitely return. My only complaint, my dish couldve been hotter. Lol i am at the cutting board right now but yelp says i am too far away to check in!"}
{"text":"Yummy!! Love the biscuits and gravy the best.  Overall great vegan food, and decent portions as well."}
{"text":"First time trying Vegan, must say it was not what I expected.  Delicious!  Try the Buffalo wings or the Ginger Carrots soup, yummy.  Deffently will go back."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to this little gem in the East valley several times and can't recommend it enough.  There are not too many places you can find that have your health in mind when developing their menu and even fewer that do it for every item they serve.  Well, here is a place just newly opened that does just that.    Sean and Krystal are the owners of this healthy eats café who have spent several years developing their menu that caters to vegetarian and vegan diets.  Although their menu does not have any \"meat\" products, you will not miss it and their \"nutty\" meat substitute is a delicious alternative.  Their foods are organic and locally sourced, their coffee is locally roasted, and their dream is to share their food, vision and passion with you.    Their café is a bright, clean, and colorful place to enjoy a meal, sip on a latte, rejuvenate with a fresh juice, or indulge in a delicious, freshly baked goods.  Sean and Krystal are always around for a good chat on the foods they serve, how they came up with their menu, and how environmentally friendly their café is.  They want to share their vision with you and hope to change your life.  They have set up their place as a pick up location for Sunizona family farms, for those who are interested in having fresh organic fruits and vegetables delivered weekly.  They are working with a local composter who will pick up the cafe's organic waste and recycle it back into the environment.  They even host educational events to help familiarize their customers with choosing a healthy lifestyle.  This all can be summarized simply with their mantra; Learn. Eat. Live.    You can check out their website at http://cuttingboardcafe.com.  Here you can read about their café, find a link to their menu, and a list of upcoming events.  Their food is delicious and I personally would like to make my way through each item they have on it.  I never thought I would ever use the words healthy and delicious in the same sentence but this café does just that.  They did a great job creating and spent many years perfecting their recipes to make each dish tasty, but more importantly good for you.    Their hours are T-Su from 7a-3p and they are closed on Mondays.  During breakfast you can enjoy breakfast burritos, sweet potato hash, fresh baked cupcakes, and fresh fruit.  They have a large selection of smoothies and coffees or teas.    For lunch you got to try the bb (black bean) burger and tacos duo (one of my favorites) or their totally vegan mac and cheese.  They also offer a vedg-head sandwich and cabbage wrap, that looked delectable and something I'll have to try next time.  The hummus trio was one of our favorites and be sure to check our their daily soup du jour!  After visiting this place you can't help but become caught up in the wave of changing your diet for the better.  My wife and I will be signing up for the weekly Sunizona farmbox and we are looking forward to eating our way to a healthier life.  So do yourself a favor and get down here to give them a try and make some new friends with the owners.  You will love it!"}
{"text":"I had my first visit to The Cutting Board today.  I ordered The Soul-Full Bowl, it was delicious!  I don't usually go for the vegetarian foods but I loved this bowl.  It had so many layers of flavor and textures.  I am definitely going back.  I felt like I was eating really well and didn't feel guilty.  I also had an Americano.  It was great, I expected it to be in a porcelain mug like the other patrons in the cafe.  It came in a paper cup.  I really love a porcelain mug and will ask for one the next time I visit.  The service was great, they checked on us again and again.  We had such a great time that we stayed for over an hour.  I am going to bring my family here next to experience this delicious new(to us) food!  I'm so lucky my friends brought me here.  I didn't even know this cute little shop existed!"}
{"text":"We came in as a playdate two moms two toddlers. We each ordered the hummus plates for our kiddos and we each had a bowl. The plain hummus had another seasoning in it. I thought it was delicious but my toddler wasn't a fan . That ok because she is a toddler and picky and I was able to wrap it to go and prob eat it for a snack later. My bowl had mushrooms avocados lentils and quinoa. It was very filling delicious and fresh. I'm so glad there is a east valley vegan option. I'm not vegan, but I love vegan meals and supporting their restaurants. Try the cowboy cookie! It's amazing. I only wish there was more chocolate or it was dipped in chocolate ."}
{"text":"Easily the best vegan food in Mesa, probably in the whole damn state. Worth a visit for all eaters of all stripes. As a vegetarian finding good vegan food options in Arizona is always a wonderful surprise, but for it to actually be good is awesome! I'll be coming back every time I visit the state!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for Lattes and oatmeal.  Been going here for years after WW meetings."}
{"text":"Great little mom n pop establishment. The staff is passionate about what they offer. The soups are excellent and the vegan and gluten free selections are a plenty. Be sure to try the tea as they make it fresh and it is very very good."}
{"text":"Wife and I are vegan and were stoked to try out a place we haven't been to before. It was a bit of a drive but thought we would try it.  Odd atmosphere.....of you can call burned out light bulbs, dirty walls, paint missing, kitchen looking dirty trash can sitting in dining room , non functional \"cooler\" where the warm beers were bought are kept. Girl at register was nice but appeared bored as heck or stoned. Took forEVER to ring up 2 incredibly mediocre meals and 2 warm beers. I asked after I opened the beer why they aren't cold, she said \"the cooler doesn't work or something....\" I asked for a frosted mug/glass and got a blank stare. Ok my bad lol. Place was NOT busy and 7 hours later our ummmm \"food?\" came out  Worst vegan burger I've ever had. Incredibly dry and the \"artesian\" bin was a giant white dinner roll lol Wife's rap was a huge wrap and small hand full of ingredients.  Don't let stoned kids run the place, just my 2 cents. We have it one shot it was sad. Seed Shack has it figured out for quality vegan chow. Sorry Cutting Board"}
{"text":"Petee made me the best juice and we had great conversation about aliens and human potential.  The breakfast burrito was phenomenal with their homemade hot sauce.  This place is awesome."}
{"text":"Finally!!! Organic food in East Mesa!!!!! This place is amazing! I have eaten here many times now and everything I have tried I have loved. I am not even vegan or vegetarian and the food is delicious. Great coffee, treats, black bean burger, lentil wrap, soups, homemade salsa and dressings; I love it. This place rules."}
{"text":"Consistently healthy task food at a great pricr. Fun lively atmosphere with cool Indie music.  A must visit if your health conscious and live in Mesa AZ"}
{"text":"Clean fresh organic flavorful fun! Breakfast burrito was huge & delicious & went great with the protien bowl. Felt great, good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ordered the 007 lentil burger on gluten free bread. Very impressed! The bean patty was moist and each bite was full of flavor. Really good! I will be coming back but ordering ahead though as it took like half an hour  from the time I ordered to getting the food to table."}
{"text":"That have the most amazing red sauce! You have to try their burro!! I have been eating here now for about two years and love it!!"}
{"text":"So my husband and I are into really healthy foods and we thought that this place would be great. When we walked in it was only two people sitting there which should have been sign to us that we should not have eaten there. The food was subprime and the black bean burger that my husband ordered was dry and my skinny enchilada was primarily all tortilla and some red sauce."}
{"text":"Good food! I was surprised being a full blown carnivore, how good their burgers were here.  They also have a walnut taco that resembles ground beef.. Excellent.  Only downfall is they are a little pricey for what you get, but worth the occasional stop."}
{"text":"Yum!! If I'm feeling super hungry, but don't want to feel too full or heavy afterwards, The Cutting Board Cafe is a perfect place to go! I also really love that it is veggie-friendly, which is pretty hard to find out in the Mesa area.. and it doesn't taste like it is purely vegetables or like it's healthy for you!!  This last visit I got their black bean burger, which was delicious with a little bit of a kick - the jalapeños definitely add some heat, and help make the burger even more special :) I love black bean/ veggie burgers and typically order them when dining out, so it's saying something that The Cutting Board's stands out to me as one of my favorites!  Friends also tried their daily taco special, as well as their tofu scramble, which they really enjoyed.    All in all, the cafe's convenient location off of Power, and wide selection of veggie-friendly meals makes it a unique spot in the Mesa-Gilbert area.  It might be a little pricier in comparison to some of the other lunch options in the area, but you definitely get what you pay for - their quality and taste make the splurge worthwhile :)"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I was looking forward to trying this place. The staff were very friendly and the place was relaxing inside. I ordered a caramel latte and unfortunately was left very unimpressed. It tasted like a warm cup of milk with a hint of coffee. I attempted to drink it but after several sips it just never got any better. I ended up throwing it away and driving somewhere else. Maybe I caught them on a bad day? Won't be going back, not worth the drive."}
{"text":"Such a great place, went there tonight and had the Roasted Veggie sandwich. It was delicious! I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a good meal, especially vegans & vegetarians! Also the people were super friendly :)"}
{"text":"Great place! Clean and tasty food. I hope they will add breakfast pizza to their main menu. Absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"One of the best organic eatery in the east valley! Friendly staffs. They often host different events to benefit the local art and vegetarian community! Five thumbs up."}
{"text":"This restaurant has vegan options but can definitely use some help in the kitchen. Orders take on average longer to fill than other restaurants that cook from scratch. I've ordered the buffalo cauliflower wings multiple times and they've gone downhill since I've first started ordering from there. Their menu has good options but needs more variety and better daily specials. I'll continue to eat here since it's vegan but it's usually the last resort."}
{"text":"I love having a vegan option in Gilbert! Thank you Cutting Board for your large menu and great food."}
{"text":"When we walked into The Cutting Board, we had no idea (other than it said bakery) what kind of restaurant it was.  When we found out it was a vegetarian/vegan restaurant, we were a little nervous, but we like to try new things so we decided to give it a try. The special was for a Greek pita gyro, which we didn't know how they would make without meat, but we love Greek flavors so we both tried that.  My husband got it with baked fries and I got it with the cabbage slaw/salad.  First of all, the flatbread was amazing.  Truly the best flatbread I have ever had.  It was whole grain, full of flavor and so soft.  Delicious.  Secondly the balance of flavors from the chopped green olives that did not overpower everything to the delightful lemon poppy seed dressing was perfectly light and delicious.  My cabbage salad was really good too, and the wait staff were pleasant.  The restaurant was clean (which is one of the reasons we stayed) and homey.  I will go back.  Thank you so much for a wonderful change of pace."}
{"text":"My respect for them! Amazing idea of having a kids night out! How fun and cool! However I can't say the same thing about the food. My bean burger was dry and it tasted horrible! I know you guys have won best in The Valley. I wish the cashier would have recommended something way much better. I asked her a million times what do you recommend? What's the best? She suggested the bean burger. Omg! That burger took forever. The family after me got their food way much before than me. And I got a crappy burger. I wasted my money!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! They make the BEST vegan biscuits and gravy! It's far from my house but so worth the drive! Delicious, fresh, healthy food! I always look forward to coming here!"}
{"text":"Worst breakfast ever. Looks like they just throw together some left over veggies and put some tortillas on the side , no flavor ,plain"}
{"text":"Calm environment , smells good immediately when you walk in, and the food is amazing. The staff are very friendly and calm. I had biscuits and gravy and my boyfriend had a tofu scramble.  They were amazing.  It would have been great to have a hotter hot sauce but the food was so good ]t wasn'ta big deal."}
{"text":"This is a cute little coffee shop. Everything is local and fresh. I loved the house made almond milk in my coffee.My only complaint is that the service was not up to par."}
{"text":"Amazing food!  I am a Midwest meat eater and this place was awesome. Must try. Bruschetta spread was great and hummus was perfect."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like this place. The first time I went I had the lentil wrap. It was bland and I couldn't finish it. I thought maybe I just didn't like it. I tried again yesterday. I had a pizza with organic mozzarella. You can't mess up a pizza, right? Wrong. It was disgusting. It had way too much sweet red sauce and was mushy, there was also little flavor to the pie. I only managed to swallow 2 pieces. I want to like it because I love the concept and the service is super friendly, but please revise your menu and get new recipes!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a late lunch place at 3:00 in the afternoon... and after reading the yelp reviews decided to give this place a try. None of us were disappointed. The atmosphere is chill, open, clean. The service was friendly. The food was really, really good. I ordered the BB burrito, my daughter and husband each ordered the soulful bowl. Also shared a bowl of creamy celery soup, and a delectable date bar that was addictingly tasty.   I'm not a vegan, but I don't eat any dairy and my daughter is a vegetarian. My husband was skeptical about it but after eating, he said it was surprisingly good.   Definitely will recommend this restaurant to anyone!"}
{"text":"Food is always good but the customer service could improve. Staff is not very knowledgeable of which foods on menu are truly vegan or vegetarian."}
{"text":"Love it!! I had to come back for the pumpkin soup and there try tea latte! Sitting in the Corredor enjoying my tea and my soup and God's beautiful day!"}
{"text":"Food is great. For a vegan with celiac disease, this restaurant is a godsend. I recommend calling ahead for take out orders."}
{"text":"Went for dinner.  Had the protein bowl.  It was 10 dollars for a small salad. It was good but should have been more. Needed more veggies."}
{"text":"The Coconut \"bacon\" wrap is excellent but the Blackened Chipotle soup was even better!"}
{"text":"Very neat little place across the street. Love the variety of food and coffee was a hit. I had buffalo cauliflower with homemade ranch which was great.   Hubby had walnut meat tacos. Tortillas were not warm hence the 4 stars. When I asked about it they said they should have been warm but that was not the case. Either way it was a good meal. I'm waiting to try the homemade granola bars they have as well. There was a coupon I used making it half off my order.   If you are vegan or gluten free this is a spot you should try out!"}
{"text":"My family is vegan and vegetarian and my brother and sister in law who were visiting from out of town are gluten free so I did a search and found this restaurant and we loved it.  It is obvious they take care in everything they make.  We all ordered something different plus the bruschetta for an appetizer and it was so good.  There aren't a lot of veg restaurants out on this side of town (east valley) to begin with and the fact that the food is fantastic and the owner was awesome just made our day.  We are so happy to have found such a great place closer to where we live and my relatives said they want to come back to eat here every time they visit."}
{"text":"We heard about this place on the local news and after reading the glowing reviews we were excited to try it out. We came on a weekday afternoon and was not too impressed with the setting but you can't judge a book by its cover right? We placed our order, tried a taco special and bean burger and the buffalo cauliflower. The tacos were tasty but simple, the app just ok with too much breading and the burger was hard as a rock. The service was friendly but they just didn't seem to give a care one way or another about anything. We are not strict vegetarians so maybe that's all the options one has. I'd rather make my veggie meal at home and save the $."}
{"text":"I loved the service and the healthy food choices.  They were having a special Valentines Day Menu the night I went and the wine pairings with the vegetarian entrees were perfect (with a generous pour).  Went the following day and had the sweet potato hash browns which were very good.  I also enjoyed a gluten free cupcake for breakfast.  Everything here is dairy free which is fantastic for me."}
{"text":"So apparently a lot can change in a couple of days. We returned solely for the opportunity of getting another amazing pumpkin spice latte and had a completely opposite experience of our first.   The woman behind the counter was just flat out unhelpful. I couldn't tell if she was simply rude and apathetic or so stoned out of her mind that she couldn't figure out the order. Either way, she made it seem like our visit was a monumental inconvenience and then my wife and daughter each had to repeat themselves at least 3 times per each of their orders. When we finally got to my drink order, the pumpkin spice latte, the entire reason for the trip, I was informed they were out of whole milk.   We should have just canceled the order and left but my wife and daughter decided to stick it out because they had already spent a painful couple of min to get their orders sorted out. They both regretted their drinks. They ended up tasting like almond milk with a splash of coffee...mostly tasteless and not enjoyable.   Sadly I went down the street and gave my money to Starbucks."}
{"text":"Flies, Flies and more Flies... when it is hot as heck inside this place I can only wonder why there are so many flies??? If I want to sweat while swatting flies off my food I would sit outside! Gross. Fix the a/c or something!!!!"}
{"text":"Not a whole lot of options for vegan spots in the east valley, this is a great choice!!! Creative vegan menu, and daily specials to try. Their coffee is one of my absolute favorites!"}
{"text":"I came back in today with my family to try the breakfast menu. I couldn't decide between the Biscuits and Gravy or French Toast. Two people in my party opted for the French Toast so I went for Biscuits and Gravy. It was delicious! It did not make me feel gross and heavy like non-vegan B&G typically did to me.   I also tried the special \"Cauliflower Buffalo Bites\" and it was delicious. I always try to make them at home and fail. But they did not fail- they were great.  I also had a Chai Almond Milk Latte. Gotta splurge on the weekend. It was great. I'm so glad to see things get better since I first went last year."}
{"text":"Delicious Biscuits and Gravy (Saturday and Sunday only) and well made Tofu Scramble Breakfast.  Came with fruit and salsa. Would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Start it pulp fiction style.  End last then work backwards.   Sean and his wife(not sure her name) are doing this because they've lived it and love it.  They menu that is - for years. The life of honoring the body and all that it unconditionally does for us, with the best food available.  He told me he just wanted to take a chance and do something that he was passionate about with the pay off being spreading the love to the individual patrons and his community.  From my perspective, they're food artists and if you're going to change the world, it will start by inspiring people to begin on the inside.  Food artists sharing their creation with whoever they can.  We were served the carefully prepared potato soup, which was a touch spicy with VIBRANT spread of flavors.  Some soups are hella one note.  This was a perfect start.   Then the hummus trio (we asked for all veggies vs chips) they obliged without question and hooked us up with a spread that was crisp and colorful.  All hummusessesss (hummisi? lol) were divine.  Not crazy garlicky like Pita Jungle, and creamy but textural.  Most fresh made hummus we've had is very oily.  In fact usually topped with oil to boot.  We purposely saved some so that we could crush it later tonight.  Stoked for that second round!  My angel side kick had the VegHead sandwich.  It ended up being the star of the show in retrospect.  The ingredients were so insanely fresh that it makes me think a little less of Wholefoods right now.  Is that possible?   Best way to describe it is \"full\".  The veggies taste full.. not dull.. like its all there somehow.  Something about the hummus in this entree and the onions and greens almost reminded us of a Tuna fish sandwich (which as vegetarian we haven't been able to enjoy in way too long.)  Obviously not a fishy flavor but that same vibe in terms of fulfillment and an after taste that we're still smiling about.  Yep we trieddd.. I mean struggled to save a little of this too so we could experience it later.   We did this because we live out in the west valley and only get down here once a month.  Ok so my entree was the Protein Quinoa Bowl.  Epic.  The ingredient spread is exactly the Eat to Live balance that your body knows exactly what to do with.  Ie. nothing gets stored as fat, you feel energized and satisfied but not sleepy and useless.  I actually got crafty and ate it in the same bite as some hummus.  Something about that combo just gives you the WTF eye roll when something is perfect.   We preceded the meal with iced americanos (good) and then Sean hand made me a pour over of a local organic coffee (great) that was smooth and had a sneaky undertone of Amaretto.  So Fun@!  Local organic coffee has been super tough to find for us so this was a nice surprise.   Things people have said on Yelp: :Not FAST food\".  I.e. - they had to wait for their food.  Our response because we've tried to make organic fresh at home, is it takes a good amount of prep when it's done at the time you're about to eat (vs. pre-prepped).  Lastly.. we always chuckle over the craziness of living in a society where you have to pay extra for non-poisioned (ie Organic)  food.  Wholefoods/Trader Joes .. etc.    But there is salvation.  Cutting board and their willingness to risk a business like this ahead of the curve, even in the face of the early bird special, Filbertos, nay-sayers.   We hope that they are rewarded with great success for following their hearts.  Go.  In joy."}
{"text":"What a great place for a vegan breakfast! Food was fantastic. I had the tofu bowl and my husband had the breakfast burrito. Service was great- but a little slow. It took 10 min to get out coffee and about 20 for the food. We were not in a hurry- so we did not mind the wait. It's a little expensive, but I feel like we got what we paid for. The portions were good sized and the coffee was great! We will definitely be back with our kids. I want to try the vegan French toast! I also love that they source their food locally. It seems to be a rare thing in Phoenix. I really hope they can influence others and bring some awareness to the importance of supporting local agriculture."}
{"text":"Such a great spot! Everything is so fresh and made to order. The food is to die for and I wish we had more of these kind of restaurants around!"}
{"text":"Great spot with even better Vegan food! We aren't anywhere close to being Vegan by any means... We popped in here for a quick breakfast. I had the granola and my husband had the oatmeal, both come with fruit and a side of heaven or you can order it as Coconut Whip Cream (mmmmm!). We also shared a French press with steamed almond milk. Everything was delicious and we will be back to try lunch and dinner. We didn't know 100% Vegan could be yummy!"}
{"text":"My husband and I eat here at least 2x a week...and we aren't even vegan. My favorites are the peanut butter and banana sandwich, roasted vegetable sandwich and protein bowl are my favorites. Great knowledgeable, friendly owners and staff and life music on Saturday nights."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful Vegan restaurant with great flavors and twists on comfort food. The Sunday Brunch is awesome... The biscuits and gravy are yummiest. The veggie sandwich is our favorite. Have not had a bad meal here and the service is good."}
{"text":"Was in town and found this place online. The food was suuuuper good and fresh and healthy! Very pleased with our meals.  The staff was kind and the place clean. If I lived out there I'd be there all the time. Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"This place was excellent. Get the date bars if you have a sweet tooth, they're definitely really sweet but also the best date bars I've ever had. The Bruschetta Board was also really good (made with the BEST bread, it seemed freshly baked and wasn't hard and too crispy like you typically get with french bread.) That was actually my mom's meal though, ha I had the half soup/sandwich combo and it was good, particularly the corn chowder topped with fresh avocado. Yum! The food was really fresh, delicious and flavorful, and I also really appreciated the attention to detail (look at that bruschetta board! It's like a work of art.)   I also loved the ambiance, nice and small (and quiet) and the staff were all so nice. I found out later one of them was the owner and he was SO nice. Made us feel really welcome and talked to us for a while. I also was really impressed with the staff after a group came in that wanted to sit outside, so even though there were no chairs out there the staff moved an entire (large) table and chairs so the group could sit outside, without batting an eyelash. It was like no big deal to them, they were totally happy to accommodate.   Overall I would come back here in a heartbeat. I plan to next time I'm in AZ!"}
{"text":"First time here for lunch over the weekend and it wasn't that busy. I ordered the tacos duo & my fiancé ordered the bb burger. We sat down and the server asked us what we wanted to drink and she didn't bring it out until like 10-15 minutes later...it was just lemonade and iced tea! I was getting thirsty... I took a bite out of the bb burger and wasn't really impressed. The bun is just too thick for the patty and makes everything too dried. We did end up asking for ketchup to help with the dryness but it just still wasn't as tasty.  The tacos duo was a lot better and actually pretty good with the tortilla chips but I wouldn't say it's amazing. I've been to a lot of vegan places that serves the tacos & black bean burger and they were just more flavorful then this place so I don't know if I would come back here. The food was just okay IMO and the customer service was eh..."}
{"text":"Sooooo good. Everything on the menu that my family has tried is delicious! Super clean, super friendly, super vegan!"}
{"text":"They bake 3 things and call themselves a bakery. Paid $11 for two cupcakes that were literally inedible. The frosting tastes like artificial sweetener and the cake tastes like flour but worse... maybe this is just what vegans eat, I'm not sure."}
{"text":"Such a cute place and I love that their almond and coconut milk is made in house! I also had their almond blueberry muffin and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"You had me at \"vegan/vegetarian food made with organic & locally sourced foods!\" If I'm going to spend money eating out, this is the ONLY place worth it. Why go to some other place that may or may not have vegan items and IF they do, they provably aren't organic. Why on earth would you spend your $ on something you wouldn't purchase and bring home to feed your family from the grocery store? You SHOULDN'T!! I keep Monsanto out of my life as much as possible.....and so should you!"}
{"text":"Just go there.. it's 5 stars. If you like healthy food you won't be disappointed. Beer and wine too. Little herb garden out front :)"}
{"text":"You can taste the quality of the ingredients with every bite. So fresh and light, I feel great leaving this restaurant to brave the Arizona heat. That black bean burger was hearty and tasty; but the cucumber side salad was simplistic perfection! If only this place was closer to where I live..."}
{"text":"Service is very slow, ambience strikes me as very anti-social; no one speaking, staff not friendly, and got my order wrong."}
{"text":"The cutting board is great if you are looking for healthier vegetarian and vegan options. We are vegan and usually go to Green because the food is more savory but the Cutting Board is definitely the healthier option. I feel the food is of high quality and I love the vibe of the restaurant but I give it 4 stars because I feel they lack a bit of flavor in their food. I also know people who have been confused and think it is ALL vegan which it is NOT. So they ordered a pizza and it was cow's mozzarella cheese and that is very upsetting for a vegan. So lack of communication on someone's part I suppose."}
{"text":"I have eaten at a lot of vegan restaurants and cafes but I was NOT impressed with this cafe. I had the \"bacon\" wrap and a tea as well as the cauliflower wings and it was all about $30. Very over priced for what you get and the atmosphere is very bland. The service was also slow. I've never left a review on yelp, but I had to for this restaurant. First and last time going there."}
{"text":"My husband and I are not vegans, but wanted to try something different for dinner so we went to the Cutting Board. What a little gem!  Not only was the food delicious and flavorful, the atmosphere was really nice. So many restaurants have lost the art of creating a nice atmosphere for their diners, but not The Cutting Board. They offer a relaxed and healthy environment with many scheduled events on healthy eating and living, and entertainment!  The desserts are yummy too!"}
{"text":"Ok place overall.....little pricey however the healthy selections are of good quality. The seasoned walnut tacos and side salsa were my choice of option that I would recommend."}
{"text":"Update: I am still a fan and love the food and drink here, but it should be noted that if you're going for lunch, it is probably best to call in your order.  My boss and I waited about 20-25 mins for our food this week.  That doesn't work so well during lunch.  They were super nice about it and the owner came our and gave us a 20% coupon for our next visit.  I'll be calling that order in ahead of time!   p.s. The gluten free date bars are amazing!!  Highly recommend you have one."}
{"text":"Their half sandwich and half salad is a good deal.   I needed something special today and they accommodated.   I appreciate their customer service.  Check out their website for classes.  I have been here about 12 times.  I always have excellent experiences. The pizzas are delicious.  The salads are great.  Juices are wonderful.  The fruit bowl is outstanding."}
{"text":"my mom and her boyfriend visited me as they were going home to california from texas and i thought it would be a perfect opportunity to make them take me to an all vegan restaurant. i had been meaning to go to the cutting board cafe ever since i heard about it so we all went.   i got the tamari tofu english muffin, hot chocolate, and a slice of pumpkin pie. my mom got the gluten-free date bar and chai latte, and her boyfriend got a raw cranberry cheesecake and a cup of coffee.  i HIGHLy recommend the tamari tofu english muffin. the pesto tasted REALLY cheesy, and the tofu was sliced thin, very flavorful, and had a nice firm texture. the hot chocolate wasn't that great, it didn't seem very chocolatey and seemed kind of watered down.   the pumpkin pie was really good. i think they might have even used fresh pureed pumpkin to make it. however, i could do without the \"whipped cream\" that it came with. i dumped it all on top of the pumpkin pie without trying it first and i was disappointed to find it had no flavor. i'm pretty sure that it was raw whipped cream, because it wasn't very smooth. not to the point of grittiness, but you could tell it was made from cashews.  i had a little bit of my mom's date bar and i quite liked it. the raw cranberry cheesecake was also adequate. it didn't quite live up to the name \"cheesecake\" i probably wouldn't call it that. it fails as a cheesecake, but on its own as a completely unique raw cake or something, it would be great. it was a bit too rich for my tastes, but good nonetheless.   in conclusion, i will definitely be returning to the cutting board cafe to have that wonderful english muffin sandwich, and possibly try some of their other dishes. the staff were also very nice and the restaurant was very clean and well kept. can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I liked the fact that they provided healthy items in the foods and drinks. I gave the place 3 stars because it lacked culture feeling and the food and drink was okay."}
{"text":"The breakfast I got had absolutely no flavor. I practically doused everything with the side of salsa to make it somewhat bare able. I highly suggest bringing your own seasonings if you want to enjoy your meal. Pretty pricey as well."}
{"text":"First time in- there was one family of 4 and 2 other customers. Looked like 2-3 employees. Girl at the counter was pleasant. Order was placed at 11:53 am. We placed the order to go. Around 12:20 one plate out of 3 showed up in a dine in plate, advised we ordered to go and she apologized said she would box up and the rest would be out in about 1-2 min. About 15 min later my friend asked what is going on, girl apologized to us and then started apologizing to some additional guest that have come in. Food arrives finally and my friends order is incorrect. Girl apologizes said I put it on the ticket. Takes it back- removes what was on it that was wring and added what was supposed to be. Did not remake the item. Very very disappointed in my experience and will not be dining there again."}
{"text":"Such good food. My husband who is not vegetarian was pleasantly surprised how good the burrito was. The hummus trio is huge!!!!  Creamy cilantro soup was a hit with my husband too. Great place. I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"What an amazing place!! My daughter and I enjoyed a wonderful lunch at the cutting board.  We both had the roasted veggie sandwiches with cucumber salad, and everything was delicious.  The service was wonderful, and the 3 cupcakes that we purchased and ate later were amazing!!! Try this special place, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place as it's the only true real vegan cafe in the east valley right now that I know of.   Sadly, both times I've eaten here, I was disappointed. I had a lemon coconut cupcake the first time. The cake gets one star, because it had a really good flavor, but was more of a muffin texture. Still, the taste was on point. The frosting? That's where things MAJORLY go south. It had no taste. Literally... There wasn't taste. The consistency and mouthfeel were awesome, but the lack of taste just really threw me off. Missing a star for that.   The second time I went, I ordered tacos made with walnut meat and a side of chips. The chips were one layer of normal sized chips, but under were 20 little chip pieces, kind of like when you're at the end of a bag. I was disappointed. The tacos had a great taste but were tiny. Two tacos could fit in one of my small girly hands. I wasn't impressed.   The staff here are great, though, and super helpful when it came to my drink and bringing my food out.   I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Always a warm welcome at this bright little gem. Love the lattes with housemade almond or coconut milk! Must grab a date bar to go tackle whatever the day my bring. Cheers to the folks at the Cutting Board! Keep up the awesome work!"}
{"text":"Food was really good. The veggie sandwich with jicama was fantastic and their soup of the day was a Thai curry. Simple and delicious. The service was not great. The person at the counter seemed disinterested and the food runner brought half our order and then took another 10 minutes to bring the other half which was the soup. The soup was warm not hot so not sure how long it was sitting out. Second time visiting this place and same experience. Food is great service is slow and disinterested"}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite place.  My husband and I have weird dietary restrictions including gluten free, dairy free, and more, yet we love hearty flavorful meals.  What is a girl in Mesa to do?  Go to Cutting Board!    Food: Every meal is delicious.  I just had the vegan-cheese pizza with pineapple, jalapeños, and nutty meat, which is my new favorite.  Their biscuits and gravy is creamy and rich.  My friend that mocks vegan and vegetarian is the one that recommended the place to me in the first place!  Type of Place:  Clean, friendly, and comfortable.  I go here with coworkers for coffee.  I go here for dates with my husband (they even have wine/beer now!).  I go here with friends to have board game extravaganzas.    Service:  I have been here 20+ times and have ALWAYS been treated kindly.  They will have fun banter when you invite it, but also know when you want space.  I think they are mind readers.  Go now!"}
{"text":"very good food 5- excellent food service 4- cafe style parking 5- lots of parking value 5- very good value for food we got."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum! I had a delicious protein bowl that was super fresh. The homemade hot sauce is awesome!! You get a free iced tea or lemonade when you check in on Yelp- I asked if they could do an Arnold Palmer instead, and it was the best tea/lemonade I've ever had!! Can't wait to come back and have more yummy things on their menu! Also the service is super friendly and fun :)"}
{"text":"Ordered a coffee with almond milk and a black bean burger. As a new veg resident, I was stoked to try out the local highly-rated veg-friendly cafe. First red flag was when I ordered the mocha with almond milk and the counter lady asked, \"With almond milk....like...a latte?\". The mocha was watery and the black bean burger was flavorless. The beans were hard as if cooked too long or not long enough. My +1 remarked that her mocha \"was terrible\" and her veggie tacos were not great either. We'll try it again someday, but I don't have high hopes when the \"cooks\" seem to be college hipster kids..."}
{"text":"The Cutting Board is a fantastic little brunch place in the middle of Mesa, and the best part is that everything is vegetarian! Walking in, I was immediately reminded of my favourite coffee shop from my college town. The seating area is very roomy and surrounded by glass walls that provide a great view and sunlight, keeping the place airy and welcoming. There is even seating outdoors for a nice breakfast/brunch in good weather (which is almost a constant in Arizona).  Looking up at the menu, you immediately see that there is a lot of options for both food and drink. After browsing for a good 10-15 minutes, I finally settled on the Santa Monica toast. This was definitely the most interesting toast I had ever seen. It almost looked like a bread in the shape of a pineapple with syrup and strawberries on the side. Inside, it was very fluffy and light, so delicious dipped in syrup. I definitely look forward to coming back for future brunch dates."}
{"text":"The food was pretty tasty. My mom thought the tacos were bland. The french toast was delicious. I liked my burger as well. But the cupcakes are AMAZING! The chocolate cinnamon was my favorite. They also had live music on the Saturday night we went which was awesome."}
{"text":"Love this place. The best vegan food in town!"}
{"text":"Good vegan food. A bit pricey. Loved the music and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Divine, delicious,  delectable,   did I say divine. a must for everyone, great ambiance, food good for body and soul. Come and enjoy!! Winter Coleslaw, tacos and a cup of Desert Rain tea was a perfect dinner on a cool rainy evening. Soul-Full bowl is part heaven, part earth and completely satisfying....."}
{"text":"I loved this place! Their veggie sandwich was delicious and my girlfriend loved her almond butter and banana sandwich on GF bread. Good coffee and fun games to play while you wait. I love the healthy food craze! It helps us naturopathic physicians gain compliance when patients have places like this to go to for a delicious, healthy and entertaining experience."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food- I had the Power Bowl (for second time now) and it was just as amazing as the first time! Great flavors and the great portions totally match the price. Can't wait to try their other menu items! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Food was really good and filling. Was very healthy. I got the biscuits and gravy, my husband got the breakfast enchilada, and my 2 year old son got the French toast. I probably wouldn't get him that again because I think the spices were a little much for a little one but I thought it was good. Great music and atmosphere. Love the biscuits and gravy."}
{"text":"The food was good but it took forever to get it. I recommend calling ahead."}
{"text":"Love the food here! Everything is super fresh and made from scratch!  Soups are wonderful! I can't leave without getting a date bar!!"}
{"text":"They had a great menu of items to choose from.  The food (salad, burger, pizza) and smoothies were pretty good, but not as good as other places we've been. What made it not such a great experience was that the restaurant was very warm, not very clean (un-bussed tables and lots of dust on the pipes hanging right over the register and some of the food), and really expensive. The gal at the register seemed bored to be there taking our order, but the two guys who brought food out to us were both very nice."}
{"text":"Great food!  They carry wonderful gluten free items. My favorite is the granola bowl. MMM Owners and staff are great.  Been going so often they know my order as I walk in. Must try!"}
{"text":"These reviews are waaaay too high. There was really nothing special about my meal. Mostly it was a bunch of rice and beans. The value was very poor. I don't get the high reviews of this place."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and although I really wanted to like it, it's just not doing it for me.    Asked for recommendations the first time in, and the cashier said her favorite dish was the hearty bowl, which was ok, but I didn't find it satisfying to eat.  It filled me up but left me wanting something else.  She recommended the burrito or enchilada or whatever it was, for my Omni guy and he said it was flavorless, but he eats my vegan food at home and loves it.    Today I went with my mom and we decided to order the bacon ranch wrap and the bbq jackfruit burger plate which was the special., to share.  Well the bbq ranch wrap was horrible.  It was made with coconut bacon, romaine, onion, tomato, avocado and ranch in a ww wrap.  All I could taste was coconut.  No bacon flavor. No smokey flavor.  No ranch flavor.  And hardly any veggies.  It was a wrap stuff with chewy, soggy coconut.  Completely gross.  The bbq jackfruit was also underwhelming.  The bbq sauce had a weird taste, but was also bland.  The bun was dense and horrible.  We also ordered a side of the fries to share, which were half burnt, and again the fries I make at home without any oil, were 1000 times better than these.  It's surprising to me that so many people think the food is so good here.    It's been empty both times we've been too, and the atmosphere is just lame.  I never feel good energy from the people who work there or from the place itself.  And all that disappointment for the low low price of $27.  Ugh."}
{"text":"My first visit to this place was very pleasant! The staff was patient as I didn't know their menu so I took a second to decide what I wanted. I ordered an Iced Americano & a homemade date bar & was very impressed by both. The shots for the Americano were perfectly pulled & the date bar was surprisingly sweet and a great snack. I have been looking for a local place with exceptional coffee & I think I found my new place to frequent! The staff member even came over to check up on me & small talked since he knew I was new to the area. The vibe is cozy & relaxed when I went (3pm-ish). I am excited to go back and try something on their lunch menu! They have fresh juices too!"}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum!! I wish I lived closer. Wonderful, healthy food. I really wish there were more restaurants in Gilbert serving such nutrient-dense food."}
{"text":"I just tried this new place for lunch today, since I'd seen people on FB talking about it, and I was in the area. Based on all the info, it sounded like an awesome new healthy-eating cafe, so I was eager to check it out.  The Cutting Board didn't disappoint. They haven't even had their grand opening yet, but it's open as of now, as a soft-open. I chatted with one of the workers, and she recommended that I try the \"bb burger\" - black bean patty, with delicious, crisp veggies on a wheat bun. It was awesome, I'm so glad I tried it! It also came with a side of house-made salsa, and blue corn chips, which was also delicious. The salsa was flavorful without being knock-you-out spicy.  I also sampled a bit of the hummus trio appetizer plate- the original hummus was my favorite, awesome flavor. All of the hummuses seemed a thick and on the dry side for me, but otherwise I liked the it. Loved the TONS of fresh veggie sticks that came with the hummus trio.  I also ordered the chocolate raw cake - it was a very rich chocolate torte, made of nuts and other all raw ingredients. I couldn't finish it, it was so rich. But amazing flavor, I loved it. Very chocolatey, awesome flavor. The crumbly chocolate crust made it feel like a chocolate cheesecake. I'd definitely order that again.  I can't wait to go back, and try all of their baked items someday. Also, the breakfasts sound really great. They have some amazing flavors of teas, as well.   If you're looking for some healthier options in the East Valley, you can't go wrong with this place. I hope the restaurant does fantastic, we need more places like this!"}
{"text":"Great little vegan cafe! The French toast was delicious as was the gingerbread cookie. My vegan daughter had the combo - veg head sandwich and spinach salad Super fresh and yummy! Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"We are not vegan/veg people and like our meat, but were able to walk out happy. Love how clean their food is. Makes me feel like I made a wise choice."}
{"text":"Great food if you like vegan food with a side of migroaggression!  Visited for the second day in a row and had a rather long wait to place an order, which would have been okay because the food is worth the wait. While placing my order with the guy at counter, I noticed he slapped my debit card on the counter (migroaggression).   During the wait for my order, I decided to observe the other patrons customer service interactions with this same person.  And 10 out of 10, each patron was handed their credit card 'in hand' and not slapped on the counter.   After bringing my observations to the person's attention, he offered this \"do you know what it's like to work in this environment?\".  I replied, regardless you took the time to make eye contact and hand back each patron's card and wait for them to receive it. His reply.... Nothing!   So, after enjoying delicious food yesterday, The Cutting Board left a bad taste in my mouth today. The counter guy needs a crash course in customer service and cultural competency! Until then, they are off my list."}
{"text":"Just fantastic, filling, gluten free friendly vegan cuisine!! So glad I got to stop here when I happened to be in Mesa:) well worth the drive!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are always looking for new places, places with thoughtfulness put into their food. This place hit the spot.   Not only do they cater to vegan and vegetarian they have a community atmosphere with meetings focused toward healthy eating every week. They source local ingredients and focus on health including so much flavor.   My husband picked this place, great choice. We are conscience meat eaters but enjoy many non meat dishes. He had roasted vegetable sandwich, and was pleasantly surprised. Very flavorful and fresh tasting!  I had the vegan tacos, with walnut \"meat\". This was my first try with nut as my meat, fantastic. The flavor was yummy and quite filling!  We will continue supporting this fantastic place!"}
{"text":"So excited there's a great healthy veggie option on the east side!! We visited recently for the first time and had the black bean burger and the peanut butter sandwich plus smoothie, so delicious. My dh is a former super processed food lover and he was so impressed by how amazing everything tasted (I couldnt stop him from stealing my chips and salsa), even talked about getting carry out in the future. Owners are extremely friendly and even let us sample some fantastic chocolate chip cookies. I prefer to shop and eat local so its like my birthday having a place so close and so fresh (plus the added bonus of knowing you're helping out a local business take off makes the whole experience that much more awesome). I vote for extended hours or a carry out night so I get to be lazy lol and not cook dinner every once in a while!!"}
{"text":"Great coffee spot the vanilla bean latte and the snicker doodle cookie was delicious."}
{"text":"Really good food.  If you are ever out in the boonies of Mesa and need some wholesome organic food this is the place."}
{"text":"I just have to update my review to say that the breakfast pizza is one of the most heavenly things I've ever put into my mouth. Thank you Cutting Board for providing heavenly things I can stuff into my face."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful!!!  From the fresh made apple juice & organic coffee to the \"huge\" (enough for two people) breakfast burrito! We also had a bowl of delicious hash, topped with a slice of avocado and fresh tomato. The owners are sweet, friendly and accommodating. Traveling from Northern California and finding this place on the web, gave our trip an A+.  You WON'T be sorry!!! If you care, at all,  about what you put in your body, you will want to eat here!!"}
{"text":"Every time i come to the cutting board, i leave with a desire to return immediately. Their food, desserts and variety of drinks is amazing. You will not be discontent with your food.  The staff are super sweet and friendly.  One of my favorite places to go alone or with company."}
{"text":"I love, Love, LOVE this place!  And it's not just because of the super-fresh, adventures in flavors that energize the palate. I also drink in with admiration Cutting Board Cafe's basic philosophy: \"learn. eat. live\" (in that order). One bite at a time.   Yes, the times they ARE a changin'! You know it's true when Mesa, AZ has itself a vegetarian/vegan bakery, restaurant, and coffee house!  And a cutting-edge one at that. For the menu is as lush as a rain forest with a rainbow of flavors and a satisfying taste sensation that rolls across your tongue with every bite!   Cutting board Cafe is a fast-casual place that serves up breakfast with such things as sweet potato hash, breakfast burrito, granola bowl, tamari tofu English muffin, freshly-baked cupcakes, seasonal fruit.   For lunch, there's appetizers consisting of olive tapas, bruschetta, hummus, veggies with walnut dip, and black and red bean salsa with chip. Entrees are mostly sandwiches and wraps (black bean burger, burritos, lentil cabbage wrap, veggie sandwiches), but there's also a vegan version of mac and cheese! And there's daily specials, as well as a ton of coffee choices, and, of course, great cupcakes and desserts. (I had the vegan macaroon... heavenly... love at first bite!)  Though my first adventure in savoring the flavor at Cutting Board Café was with the vegan tacos, featuring a truly amazing \"meat\" mixture made of walnuts, served on a pair of soft-as-a-marshmallow corn shell with blue corn chips and salsa on the side. But it wasn't the just taste of joy across my tongue with each bite of culinary delight that sold me on this place.   It's the whole concept of Cutting Board Café. Bringing awareness of the importance of food choices to Mesa, AZ, all in a cozy, bright setting; and how much our choices impact ourselves and the world.  And how each bite can reflect a taste of the good life... in Mesa, AZ. Try it. You'll like it!"}
{"text":"Searching Yelp for something new, I came across The Cutting Board. I was looking for something vegan or vegetarian, as I am limited on carbs, dairy and sugars. This is going to sound repetitive to those who know my reviews, but CB has ONLINE ORDERING!!!  I opted for the protein bowl and a Mr. Marley smoothie. As I checked in, I also scored a free iced tea or lemonade - I chose the lemonade...pink lemonade!   The restaurant was in a very busy strip mall. On a Friday night, parking was very, very sparse. The actual entrance faced north into a breezeway between businesses. In this space, CB had a bunch of cute tables. The west wall of the restaurant opened up toward the parking lot. There was bar-style seating along this wall, so it was a great spot in our fantastic weather. There were a few tables inside as well. There was a small specials board on the service counter...man, they had a horchata smoothie on there! There were decadent desserts displayed, and an easy to read chalkboard menu. The restaurant was also very clean, and the staff friendly. So friendly and qelcoming6, that an employee came out to bus a table, looked eight in my face, smiled a said hi. Almost like he knew me. It was cool.  Ok. Food. The protein bowl was salad greens, walnut meat, avocado, tomato, black beans and quinoa. It came with salsa and hot sauce, so you really don't need a dressing. I opted out of it. This was really tasty and filling. The quinoa really soaked in the flavors, and when mixed with the nut meat, it really brought out a sweet, savory and spicy mix. The Mr. Marley smoothie was coconut water, pineapple, banana and hemp seed. It didn't taste like there was banana. Maybe it's just me. But it was refreshing, and I really liked it. The pink lemonade was not too sweet, and just tart enough to shock you upon first sip. I also loved this. My dinner experience was great here, and I will be back to try other items!"}
{"text":"I ate at the Cutting Board today and had their Hearty Bowl and it was excellent!  I also took home a piece of the date bar and it was most excellent as well!"}
{"text":"The  coconut \" bacon\" ranch wrap ( daily special) was the best vegan wrap I've ever had. Loaded with great flavor and texture. I'll be back! Great food and portion sizes,"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and men. I love how unique this spot is and friendly staff. Makes me not even care how long it takes for my food because I know it's been made with love! Might be wise to call in your order in advance. It's worth the wait though!"}
{"text":"Such a cute little spot! I'm so glad to have stumbled across The Cutting Board. It's very difficult to find a place that ISN'T a chain-restaurant in Mesa(snow-bird city). They offer a variety of healthy food, that doesn't fall short when it comes to flavor or quality. I was so pleased to hear that everything is organic, and that they seek out local produce. *keep your money where your house is* It does take a little longer to get your food, than a \"normal\" place but it's worth it. - I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Awesome to have vegan and vegetarian options in the Far East valley.   Foods are based more on homemade whole foods instead of processed fake meats.   Friendly and knowledgable staff.  Will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"My husband is a huge fan of The Cutting Board and I am liking it more with each time. They have great items for people who are gluten free and I love their bowls."}
{"text":"Not a bad meal at all if you don't mind waiting! It's a small place, so waiting about 20 minutes seem normal to me. The lady at the counter seemed to be new (not sure)? They did not have enough almond milk for me and my lady, so I sacrificed for soy. My lady asked for no strawberries, instead she wanted bananas (on her french toast). They gave her strawberries anyway, with a side of bananas. Not the biggest deal or rant hopefully ha. Besides the wait, I still feel that this is genuinely a nice quality cafe, with kind employees."}
{"text":"Such a diverse and interesting menu. I have been here twice and ordered the protein bowl, hummus trio, and roasted vegetable sandwich. All were delicious.   Counterside ordering gets your food to you relatively quickly and all of the items seem freshly prepared. They have an impressive beverage selection as well (smoothies, coffees, beers).  The only improvement I could ask for would be better seating with some more comfortable chairs for studying over long periods."}
{"text":"Second time here... First time with my 94-year-old father (who thought it was so good that it should be franchised - LOL.) This time we included my 88-year-old mother, who also thought it was delicious! I love and so appreciate going to a place where I don't have to tell the waitstaff all about my diet! I also enjoy knowing that they work in as many of the fresh produce, and whole foods, as possible, into their menu options. Would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"I have wanted to check this place out for a while now. It is located in a strip mall. The restaurant is cozy and clean. They offer a variety of vegan, gluten free, and healthy options. My husband and I split the Sunrise smoothie, and the light start. The smoothie had OJ, Spinach, Strawberries and chia seeds. The smoothie was very good. The light start included 2 slices of sprouted grain bread, mashed avocado, fresh made almond butter and a small bowl of seasonal fresh fruit. I only ate the fruit and almond butter, and mashed avocado as I follow a gluten free Paleo diet. The fruit was fresh, and the avocado mash and almond butter were good. Upon looking at the menu, I plan to be back to try some of their other options, especially their salads. In the meantime, I'll probably stop in for a smoothie now and again."}
{"text":"I've been here so many times I've lost count. The food here is great. I'm always excited about trying something different on the menu because no matter what I order, I know it'll be packed with flavor and served hot. This place is definitely a family favorite."}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly, and the burger I had was delicious! I finished the whole plate and even though I was very full I didn't feel gross after. Very delicious and clean food! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm really glad there is a place like this in the area. Sometimes it can take a while to get your food, but it's always worth the wait. I do wish they had a few more gluten free options. They have gluten free biscuits but the gravy isn't gluten free so that doesn't help much. Friendly staff. Great espressos. Serves beers/wine. Tasty specials. Excellent date bars and GF cupcakes. Especially tasty vegan icings for cupcakes. Not usually crowded when I'm there.  I recommend the dinner pizza, breakfast pizza (not GF), macro bowl, and the cauliflower wings (might be seasonal/special). Not the best vegan biscuits and gravy I've ever had but I'll take it in the absence of other options."}
{"text":"my husband and i were on the hunt for a good smoothie.  We went a couple places and were already closed, and another place which gave us literally undrinkable smoothies (and it doesn't really take much to impress us, smoothie wise).  So we ran to the cutting board to see if they would still take us before they closed at 8 (it was 7:59... i know, we are the worst).  But we went in and asked if he would be willing to make us a smoothie and he was more than happy to.  and it was ridiculously delicious.  Definitely the kind of customer service and deliciousness that will have us back on a regular basis. :D"}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant in all of mesa. Very relaxed atmosphere and their cappuccinos with homemade almond milk are amazing. Their chai latte cheesecake is probably my favorite item on the menu and I always love the service."}
{"text":"Really good atmosphere and sweet treats. I was not the biggest fan of the veggie burger I had but that wasn't do to it not being great I just am not a fan of the flavor for myself my friend loved the flavor. Everything else was wonderful I recommend trying this place. I know I'll be back."}
{"text":"Oh, how I love The Cutting Board. They have probably the friendliest staff in town. The food is fresh, and flavorful. And even my meat loving family thought it was good."}
{"text":"Very clean, quiet and relaxing atmosphere. Vegan and vegetarian foods. Super healthy and everything is fresh."}
{"text":"Raved about the food to a friend and took her there....an hour for my sandwich....explanation was that it was backed up in the kitchen...um it's a sandwich....went again...ordered to go ahead of time....girl said nothing ...literally...I had to say ...hi I ordered to go....rings the order and says nothing...I said is that it....she was like huh???? geez say hi or bye or thank you...."}
{"text":"We were looking for a new breakfast spot, and came upon The Cutting Board on Yelp. The food was delicious! Amongst the 3 of us we had the French toast, sweet potato hash and oatmeal (which is far from boring!). Everything was full of flavor, especially the fruit, which is due to everything being locally sourced. And my two vegetarians we pleased with vegetarian and vegan offerings.  The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is because when everything takes time, including the fresh pressed Apple juice. It's a small inconvenience, and the wait is worth it."}
{"text":"Our first visit here today...delicious food and beautiful presentation! Very friendly and helpful staff too. We ordered the Sweet potato Hash, Oatmeal, Date Bar and a Scone. Everything was perfect, served quickly, and delicious! The portions were generous which absolutely made up for being a bit higher priced. We go to MD Anderson Cancer center often and this cafe/bakery is only 5 min drive away. So happy to discover this gem.  Looking forward to our next return."}
{"text":"I had the walnut tacos. They were just ok. Thought there would be some kind of taco seasoning or flavor..all the greens, avocado, tomatoes were fresh & very good salsa. I'm newly vegan so I may not be the best judge. Daughter had the pizza & loved it. Nice to have a vegan option in the area. The people there are very nice."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place. I travel 3-4 weeks of every month around the U.S. And sometimes struggle to find good healthy meals especially being gluten free. I am extremely impressed with \"The Cutting Board\" and everything on the menu. I always look forward to coming Arizona so I can eat here Breakfast+ Lunch+ Dinner. Everything on the menu is incredibly fresh and I leave feeling Happy and Healthy every time."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for breakfast one morning and it wasn't bad; although I do have a couple of complaints.  First off, the staff wasn't too friendly.  When we walked in, we weren't greeted.  We walked up to the counter and started looking at the menu and were finally asked, \"Are you ready to order?\", which came from a voice at the other end of the counter.  My daughter and I decided to try the breakfast burrito and the hubby went with the breakfast pizza, all of which were very good and the portions were huge.  They are pretty pricey but we definitely could've split a meal.  We also ordered iced coffee with almond milk.  Unfortunately, it was mostly milk and we couldn't taste the coffee.  Also, my daughter ordered her burrito without some of the veggies.  When it was delivered, the server pointed out the one without the veggies and my daughter took it.  It wasn't until halfway through our meal that I noticed my daughter's plate was full of the veggies she had picked out of the burrito...what a waste! I ended up with the one with only beans and potatoes.  Also, they have an open air window, which is very cool, but not when there's a dairy farm nearby and you can smell the cows.  So my overpriced breakfast turned out to be a mixture of the smell of cow manure, almond milk, and no veggies, which I love.  Pretty disappointing.  Three stars though for the huge portions and the fact that the food is pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Way too expensive to visit on a regular basis. They need to get ridd of the plants at the tables because they have a huge mosquito problem. I got bitten several times on my last visit. Don't forget to check in on Yelp for your ice tea. It will off set the cost of your visit."}
{"text":"Stopped by to grab a coffee last night and walked into a clean comedy show. I love stand up so I sat there and watched it for an hour. Real funny stuff. One comic, Mike Enders was really good. Killed the show. Gonna have to keep an eye out for his name and check him out again."}
{"text":"I have been vegan for years. I travel often so I find A LOT of vegan spots every where I go. I live in San Diego now moved from Phoenix 3 years ago. I decided to try Cutting Board since it was close to my family's house. I am extremely disappointed in the food. I ordered the \"bacon\" wrap and the tacos for my daughter. We both threw our food away, in the garbage, $32.00 later.... It was horrible. I love yelp because I read reviews on almost every where I go. I am sorry to say this was a huge disappointment and I will not return nor recommend this place to any of my healthy eating friends or family. Sorry but two thumbs down for me."}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of times. We went once on a weekend night and it was packed and loud - there was a band playing just outside. Fun atmosphere. Good date spot.   The menu is limited, and we haven't tried the pizza. Everything we've tried so far has been good, except the desserts. We love vegan treats, especially baked goods. We bought an assortment to share with family and people ate them, but were not impressed with our \"healthy\" tasting desserts. Most of the baked goods are the classic one-for-all vegan AND gluten-free. It is possible to make vegan baked goods that taste BETTER than non-vegan, but gluten restrictions are the fun police of the dessert world. I know it's double the work and inventory to separate Veg and GF, but we vegans suffer through limited options everywhere we go. The few options we have should taste good. If you're GF, you'll probably think they're great. Pomegranate Cafe and Green/Nami have good vegan desserts.  We'll be back, but we know better than to order dessert."}
{"text":"Their Breakfast Pizza and Coffees are delicious! Even my kiddos who aren't always on board with me going vegan even admit this place has good food and that says a lot! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place the food is amazing and the service is too. The biscuits and gravy are the best and they have great coffee and baked goods."}
{"text":"We just found this local treasure, and my husband and I can't get enough of this delicious food! Breakfast is our favorite meal, and it's hard to find good vegan breakfasts, but this place has the best vegan breakfasts! I've tried the tofu scramble bowl, and the breakfast pizza, and I have eaten every bite of both! The ambiance is that of a pleasant coffee shop, and the service has been terrific!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I'm not a strictly health food person, but I came with a friend who eats vegan/organic (it's hard to find a restaurant in Mesa that's totally organic, so this was nice). I had the Black Bean Burrito and it was plenty of food and very fresh. I had to eat it with lots of salsa but people used to vegan/organic would probably love it. I have a 3 year old and a 9 month-old, my son got the oatmeal. We both LOVED it, and I could've eaten a whole pot of it. It was delicious. My daughter had plenty of healthy things to nibble on from the fruit in the oatmeal and off my burrito. The price was totally reasonable for all organic and the portion size. I will be going back, this is a great establishment to support!"}
{"text":"I went to this cafe because I am a vegetarian and was looking to try something new.  There was a decent amount of options and I chose the black bean burger and upgraded to a side of soup(French onion) for an extra $2 for about $13 total if I remember correctly. The flavor was ok but for $13 I would expect something a bit more filling and it wasn't. Maybe I chose the wrong item and I'll go back to give them another try. The establishment was cute and clean and I loved the fact that everything on the menu was vegetarian."}
{"text":"The foods was not too bad. It lacks flavors but my partner's sandwich was delicious. He had roasted veg sandwich and it was full of flavors in it. I got lentil wrap and unfortunately it tasted bland. I ended up added salsa to it and that helped a bit. The prices were too ridiculously high. Nearly costed us thirty dollars just fire a wrap and a sandwich plus two glasses of iced tea. The side were just the chips. For that reason, we probably wouldn't come back again unless we are going there with friends. I still would recommend the place. Price just doesn't agree with me that's all. The iced tea was really delicious, though!"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in the area I'll always go here for food. It's a little slow, but the entrees and desserts are great!"}
{"text":"Just went to the website to order food and when I went to checkout it sent me to a chownow website and asked me to login and gave me the option of logging in with Facebook which I did, finished the order and hit complete and it showed charged $30.15. Called Cutting Board because it wasn't clear what I should do next and was informed they didn't know if they had received it. I specifically ordered it for right now and they don't know if they got it???? You have the option of having it prepared now or later and I chose now. They put me on hold and never came back to the phone. This is supposed to make things easier??? Won't be eating here. What a waste of time!"}
{"text":"My family actually owns a vegan/vegetarian cafe out in Chandler, so you'd think I'd be super biased when it comes to other veg cafes, but I can't lie when I have good food. Cutting Board is a family run cafe with fresh made baked goods, delicious smoothies and juices, and both a great breakfast and lunch/dinner menu. I go with my mom as much as possible to support this little place because they deserve so much more recognition! If you're in the East Mesa area, vegan or not, try this place because it will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Great vegan cafe in the 'burbs of the East Valley! We definitely need to patronize them! Have been using The Cutting Board as a lunch meet up location. The food is delicious and guilt free. I was shocked at just how good the meatless tacos are."}
{"text":"Good first visit. Had the Tofu Scramble. Looks beautiful, tastes good. I thought it was a little dry but I didn't ask for something for it. Loved my iced coffee. Will definitely go back to try more! Support vegan restaurants!"}
{"text":"Sorry guys, it really shouldn't take 30 minutes to make 2 small vegan tacos. There were a couple people that ordered dine-in ahead of me, but when their food came out, it looked like everyone had ordered some form of salad, so that's even less reason for the preparation to be so slow!  That being said, the tortillas tasted and looked freshly made. The taco ingredients were tasty, with a vibrant pleasing look. I really liked the spices and seasoning in the walnut meat mixture, and the tomatoes and micro-cilantro were very fresh. The salsa had a touch of spice which livened up the meal, and the sesame cucumber side was refreshing.  The pay system is through an i-pad where you have the option of adding tip to your meal right when you order, which I always find weird. How can I adequately add tip to service which I haven't even received yet? (I usually don't carry enough cash to tip in cash after the end of my meal either- I usually leave it up to the credit card)"}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this restaurant, as a vegetarian I'm always on the lookout for veggie friendly restaurant. I ordered the daily soup and a salad. I noticed they do mention that there may be a wait for food to arrive (\"good, real food takes time\") and was prepared to wait, however, my food took over an hour to arrive... The soup (Zuppa Toscana) was very tasty but the salad was only ok, many of the vegetables had little flavor. Will likely not return."}
{"text":"Cute and quaint little cafe featuring a clean assortment of foods. A friend and I stopped in here for lunch. The food was very fresh and the staff was very friendly. We will definitely return.   The only suggestion I have is that the sign mention the raw cuisine options. Currently the sign from the street just says coffee shop but this is definitely more than that."}
{"text":"Amazing skinny enchilada. Wish this place was closer to home. Very generous with the enchilada sauce."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegan, but was looking for a good breakfast after taking a friend to the mesa airport. This place had a lot of mixed reviews- but most of the bad was about service not food so i thought I'd try it out as I don't trust many people's negative service reviews.  The service was fine. Nothing exceptional but not rude or bad by any stretch of the imagination. The decor of the place is fun and inviting. The patio area outside is nice too. Lots of ads for open mic night and live music makes me want to come back to check those out.  I thought the Santa Monica French toast sounded good and had some good reviews. It was fantastic! The bread was so good and super fragrant. It felt like a $20 plate but was only 10 bucks. The almonds and strawberries topping it were the perfect touch. The potato hash was really good too, liked the sweet mixed with the regular and a few purple- was tasty. The whole meal felt like a nice homemade, healthy dish.   Some better non-coffee drink choices would be nice. $6 for an o.j. didn't sound appetizing. A minor holdup to a great overall experience!"}
{"text":"The \"Hearty Bowl\" and Roasted Red Bell Pepper Bisque are awesome!! Great spot to eat. Real thankful."}
{"text":"We were in the area to check out Power Road Market and stopped by here beforehand for a grab to eat. I ordered their nut tacos which were great. The cold corn tortillas threw me off, I think it would be better warm. However, the flavors were great and the portion size was perfect. My boyfriend got their BB burrito. We both thought that it was OK. It was definitely missing something as it was pretty dry and bland.  If you're looking for a vegan restaurant with unique offerings, I would try this place out!"}
{"text":"Cute Vegan cafe with a great menu! I was in Phoenix for work and was missing my granola-approved fare! Found this place on Yelp and so thankful I did!   I brought a carnivore who devoured his Soul Bowl. He practically licked the bowl and kept commenting on his satisfaction with the meal.  I ordered the duo tacos and upgraded for kale salad (+$1) instead of chips. The tacos came with walnut-meat and although it wasn't quite as good as the ones I order at Trilogy in SD, it still hit the spot. It was tasty, fresh and satisfying. My only complaint is I wish they would have tossed my salad. Kale  should always be massaged and dressed! No puns intended.   For dessert we shared the gluten-free date bar. It was very rich. The two of us together could not finish it. It's not for the gluten-ous, it's for the gluttonous!"}
{"text":"I was on a very particular, restrictive diet when I ate at the Cutting Board, which can get pretty bland when you cook for yourself. Maybe I was just starved for something good, but the Soul-Full Bowl I ordered was absolute heaven. Portion was large and hearty with a good balance of veggies, grains, and flavors (tahini + hot sauce is a winner -- who knew?). I ended up buying a jar of that yummy hot sauce before I left; it kept well in the fridge for quite a while and was a staple in all future homemade bowls. The folks behind the counter were very kind and accommodating. I wouldn't come here if you are looking to get something fast, but I'm a firm believer in slow food. Good things take time! I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Pretty good vegan cuisine! Need more options! Everything I've had was delicious. Cauliflower wings, baked wedges, and ranch wrap were all wonderful!"}
{"text":"I'm usually impressed by the vegan spread they have to offer and the service they provide.  However, this time around the food was certainly less than status quo; they were out of mushrooms, both of the burgers were super dry... and those awesome fig bars they serve weren't so awesome.  What happened guys?"}
{"text":"I don't understand why a whole-foods plant-based restaurant can't make a simple smoothie. I've gotten two smoothies here on separate occasions and both times, they literally don't blend it long enough. They have a freaking Vitamix...there is no excuse for chunks of spinach or chia seed. I didn't pay $8 for a grainy smoothie. I have a Vitamix at home. I once accidentally blended an avocado pit into my smoothie and it was still velvety smooth. Yet this place can't blend normal fruits and veggies and seeds completely. Give your employees a Vitamix tutorial, for the love of veganism! On both occasions, I would have sent it back or had it remade, but it took them so ridiculously long to make my crappy smoothie, that I didn't trust them to make me another one without me being late to work. Also, they use ice in their smoothies, which any semi-competent smoothie maker knows dilutes smoothies. That's why you are supposed to use frozen fruit and frozen bananas to make it cold and thick without making it watery. It's really not that hard. Please, Cutting Board, use frozen fruit for smoothies, cut the ice, and tell your employees to hit the blend button for more than 10 seconds. A minute is probably more appropriate. For the top of restaurant this is, smoothies should be the easiest thing to master. I don't really plan on coming back. I rather go hungry for lunch than waste almost $10 on a smoothie that tastes and feels like it was made by a complete novice in an old $15 blender."}
{"text":"I'll preface this by saying I did walk in 2 minutes after they opened. I ordered the Santa Monica French toast, which looked interesting when it arrived 10 minutes later, but it was a blob of raw dough inside and inedible. The potato hash was also a shade over raw, and barely warm. If the food isn't ready - DON'T serve it!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place so much, but I just can't say I do anymore. Every time I call to make an order the girl always asks me the same question multiple times and never actually listens to what I want to order so has to ask again. I have had too many of my orders messed up and the quality of the food has just gone down so much within the past two years. Really unfortunate because I don't really have many options for restaurants in this area that cater to a vegan diet. Oh well."}
{"text":"The hubs had the \"bacon\" ranch wrap, our daughter had the French toast, and I had the black bean and avocado burrito. Everything was delicious!  It was a bit of a wait for the food but the kiddo and I played board games that they have there while we waited and the hubby planned out our grocery list. I love having vegan options so close to our home so we're not stuck cooking only at home every day. Even better when it's specifically vegan so I don't have to scour the menu for options or ask about ingredients. We also plan on bringing my husband's mom since there are lots of gluten free options and she has Celiacs.  Definitely planning on visiting again and exploring more of the menu."}
{"text":"A vegans must! And the drip coffee was phenomenal. Fast and friendly service! Come check them out!"}
{"text":"So so delicious! I love how good I feel when I eat at the cutting board! The employees are nice and the food tastes delicious! They have specials sometimes and their gyro is super delicious and that's coming from my skeptical mother (love ya mom). Coffee is great! I'd probably eat anything on the menu."}
{"text":"I found this cute restaurant through Yelp and I'm so glad I did. There were so many healthy, vegan, gluten-free options on the menu and they all sounded great. The staff was unbelievably friendly, asking us about our day and giving us advice on what to order. They ended up letting us order the tofu scramble even though they had stopped serving breakfast and they threw on some extra bacon-flavored coconut for my dad (he's not vegan, but he's a really good sport). The decorations were very modern and created a positive environment. Anyways, don't take my word for it... go try it yourself! It's a little on the pricey side, but the excellent service and quality are beyond worth it!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I ordered the pizza with basil, spinach and olives! The cheese was non dairy and my crust was gluten free! And to top it off I got a black tea with honey! So yummy. So fresh. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is unbelievably cute, the food is good and super healthy. It's so hard to find good vegan food sometimes, places like the cutting board make me really happy, staff are super super friendly! They make you feel like family, and they have good dessert!"}
{"text":"Best vegan place in the valley! It's extremely difficult to find a restaurant that you have to pick and sort through the menu and then google to make sure that the food is vegan. This place may be a little on the pricier side but it is totally worth it! We usually eat at home so we know what ingredients we are eating but with this place you don't have to worry. Highly recommended to vegans out and about in the east valley."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp. They are also dog friendly. When I use to bring my dog here, the staff would bring him a bowl of water and treats.   The salads are great and ice chias."}
{"text":"This place was awesomesauce!   We ordered the bruschetta as an appetizer and loved it. It came out on a large block of wood and we ended up taking two pieces home otherwise we would not have had room for our meal. It was delicious and the bread is homemade!  I ordered the tacos and was blown away by the walnut filling. I will have a hard time exploring the menu when all I will be able to think about are those tacos. My husband got the burrito and almost didn't want to give me a bite. I think the only reason he did was to get a bite of mine. haha.   Their iced tea is also amazing and they give refills!   We will definitely be going here again. Not just to support local, organic, vegan food in the otherwise widely vegan barren Arizona, but because their food was just that good."}
{"text":"Food was good! So nice to find a quality vegan restaurant in Mesa. I placed an order for pick up through the Yelp app and noticed afterwards that the prices are around $4-$5 more when you order that way. I definitely recommend just going in and placing your order instead of ordering through the app. Wish I would have noticed before?"}
{"text":"French toast is amazing!!! The sweet potato hash is not what I was expecting as a new vegan...but wow! It was good!! Lots of flavor and sweet staff."}
{"text":"If I didnt feel that I had to see what the greater Phoenix area had to offer, I would have eaten here for all my meals!  My boyfriend (carnivore) and I were fortunate to be staying in the east valley and enjoyed a packed lunch (split a kale salad and lentil cabbage wrap- spot on).  It was a few hours before lunch service and they were nice enough to accommodate.  We returned the next day to pick up delicious and nutritious vedg-head and roasted vegetables wraps.  My boyfriend enjoyed a black coffee which we had no expectations for being so good! Chai oatmeal cookies were delicious!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the owner for being very pretentious and arrogant. This place is shit. I came here because of good reviews with my mom who is not a vegetarian or vegan. I really enjoyed my food, but my mom did not like it and expressed how she felt to the owner himself and he was unwilling to give her money back or even offer to her to try another dish or even sympathize with her. He just told her that \"everyone who comes there likes the food and he thinks everything is seasoned well\". I couldn't believe how rude and haughty he was. It's his restaurant, but I think it's good to try and make people happy who come to your business and spend their hard working money to try your food. He did end up giving her money back and slammed it on the counter for her. I asked one of the girls there for a box for my fruit I didn't eat and another girl asked why I was going to take the food we didn't like and I told her I didn't have a problem with my food and I wanted to take my fruit bc I paid for it and I wanted to eat it later. I could not believe how ghetto she was being. The owners attitude is definitely rubbing off on his employees and that's not a good thing from what I've seen. I liked my food, but I will never come back here because of how they treated my mother and how unprofessional they were. What ever happened to respecting your elders? My mom is 58 years old...like show some freakin respect and professionalism."}
{"text":"We had such a great first experience at The Cutting Board! Starting with a friendly welcome from the owner Sean and the staff, through the amazing lunch we had, down to our amazing cinnamon bun treat with espresso! Everything we had whole heartedly reflected the thought and love put into each dish. The sweet potato cabbage soup stole the show though! It was such a wonderful surprise of perfectly paired flavors!! Can't wait to get back and experience other menus items! Next up, breakfast...can't wait to make hard decisions of what to order because I'll want it all!!"}
{"text":"This was an awesome place to try out on our trip to Arizona!  I am forever posting pictures of my vegan fare on facebook, and a friend had commented that if ever I came to visit, I should meet her for lunch at a restaurant next to her hair salon.  She's not vegan or anything, but it's near her place of business, and the restaurant has fantastic food. We met my friend, and we ordered a vegan pizza, bruschetta and walnut tacos!  Wow!  Everything was delicious!  The walnut tacos were by far, my favorite!  My traveling companion was raving about this place hours later!  Can't wait to visit Arizona again so we can make a return trip to this little gem in East Mesa!"}
{"text":"I love this place and am beyond happy to have good vegan food out here in east Mesa! Shawn makes the best soups - so vibrant with spice and flavor! And I can always find something to satisfy me, whether it's coffee and a pastry, a snack, or a meal and a delicious beer! And the pizza - the sauce is sooo good!!   I also love the sense of family and community here! Shawn and Krystal are passionate about what they do and work hard to make The Cutting Board appealing to a variety of tastes."}
{"text":"Lovely place! Fresh, flavorful food.  Great sandwiches, love the sesame cucumber salad."}
{"text":"Healthy Vegan Cupcakes!  My 5 yo daughter w/food allergies LOVES them even tho they taste like veggies to me.  She now has a special treat to take to parties!   Delicious cookies that aren't sugary!  And the date bars... amazing (when cold)!  Can't wait to try more!"}
{"text":"Not my favorite place. Came in for a healthy dinner with my daughter. After a few bites of her kids quesadilla she started itching all over. When I asked what ingredients were in the \"cheese\" (because I thought my daughter had hives) they informed me that they had a mosquito problem. The employees have cans of \"OFF\" behind the counter so they don't get eaten alive while at work. May I suggest you close the doors for a few days and get your bug  problem under control. We were in the restaurant for less than 30 mins and my daughter left with 24 mosquito bits on her legs and arms."}
{"text":"Good customer service and love the concept of healthy and vegan eating however my fiance and i ordered a few things and it was awful!! I ordered a pumpkin latte and it is overloaded with what seems to be clove or some other kind of spice. We also got the coconut espresso cupcake and the pumpkin cupcake was so dry, unsweet and not well made at all! And its not just because it is vegan. I have had many vegan pastries in my life but nothing as terrible as this. I do not recommend getting any cupcakes or pumpkin lattes at this establishment. Do not know why this place has such a high rating"}
{"text":"Amazing food with a comfortable atmosphere! The vegan broccoli soup was incredible!! My husband had a pumpkin spice latte and he said it was delicious!! Made with real pumpkin & good quality spices. We will definitely come back here again soon!!!"}
{"text":"We got the tofu scramble and the hummus sandwich. Both were fresh and amazing tasting. Definitely will go back!!!"}
{"text":"Would only change one thing. The word \"bakery\" in the title. There is just a tiny case on the counter like at a coffee shop.  Had the cowboy cookie that was choc full of lovely chewy oats and coconut. Yum! Got the apple strudel muffin for breakfast later. Also lovely. After seeing the menu now I would love to go back for a hot breakfast or lunch. Quality!"}
{"text":"Had a cold brew and a oat date bar. The cold brew was actually really good, which is surprising for East Mesa. The oat bar was falling apart. I wouldn't have served it.  This place has potential for the area, I think it could do well."}
{"text":"My mom and I ate here this afternoon for lunch, and I was nicely surprised. I ordered the half order of their bruschetta board and their soup of the day, which was a potato-jalapeño soup. My mom had their Roasted Vegetable sandwich, with a salad, and we both had their iced tea. My Bruschetta board arrived with 4 nice sized pieces of bread, and I probably could have just ordered that for my lunch and it would have been enough. My only suggestion would be that they use basil next time, either instead of the parsley, or along with the parsley. It was very good, but I missed the basil. My potato jalapeño soup was just as tasty, and I would order it again as well. My mom who has recently gone vegan with my dad, enjoyed her Roasted Vegetable sandwich too, and the side of jalapeño hummus they gave her was incredible, as was the salad and dressing. All in all it was a very fulfilling meal, and we certainly didn't leave hungry. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"They're under construction and have changed their hours, which they haven't updated on the website. But when you arrive there, the open sign is on... I got dropped off here from the airport to discover (after my ride left) that they were closed. Update your hours on Google and Yelp if you're altering them."}
{"text":"Really great service, ultra fresh food!  I had the veghead sandwich and it was a crunchy, savory, deliciou surprises.  We also tried the gf zucchini muffin.  It was tender and not overly sweet.  I very much enjoyed lunch at this lovely spot today!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried The Cutting Board when I decided I needed to eat better. It was a total surprise to me that we had such an amazing little vegan gem of a restaurant in Mesa. We we're greeted very warmly by the person behind the counter when we entered. When we told them it was our first time, they were happy to given suggestions of items they like on the menu.  We ordered a pizza and a sweet potato black been burrito. Both were very good. The pizza was my favorite. The burrito was big. More than enough for my husband and I to share and bring leftovers home.  I don't feel like it took too long to get our food, and everything was hot when it arrived. I was so excited to discover this gem with all the healthy options that it offers. If you are looking to go vegan or just eat healthier this is a place to check out for sure."}
{"text":"The service was extremely slow and seemed understaffed. The restaurant wasn't even full. It was frustrating bringing my meat eating friends here because they were already pessimistic so waiting a long time for our food didn't help. When the food finally did come out it was delicious though."}
{"text":"I am always looking for healthy places to eat.  So I'm trying this place! I let the girl with the septum ring, who was working the front counter know  the conFusing hours listed in the Clipper Magazine AND on the door. Do they open at 8 am or 11 am? Who knows!  But, she didn't seem to really care, assuming that i was looking at an old  magazine. I wasn't old, it was a current issue!  Now the septum-ring girl needs to know how rude she seems.  Maybe it's unintentional, but none the less she is very off-putting and not very welcoming. The star I posted here is only for the food not the customer service. For customer service they get ZERO stars! The girl needs to get some customer service skills. If you decide to come to this place and try their food you will know exactly who I'm talking about.   OH and by the way,  they open at 11 a.m. and the food was ok."}
{"text":"This place is the best!  Food is delicious, so easy to order (they actually know what's in the food), staff is friendly and helpful, really creative recipes."}
{"text":"Good food that is good for you. Even you non-vegans will like this.... well those that eat their vegetables anyway. If you don't, tisk tisk. I came in on a Friday night so hungry because I didn't have a change to make my spaghetti squash meal as I planned. Currently I'm on the Daniel fast, which is like a cleanse diet. Pretty much vegan.  Back to the food.... so I came in and the young lady at the counter was kind and let me try the black bean and sweet potato soup. I'm not a huge fan of sweet potatoes so I was reluctant.  It was so yummy. Great for a chilly day like today. It had a little kick to it which instantly had me hooked. I like my food spicy.  Paired that soup with a half a roasted vegetable sandwich, also very good.  I'm full and happy. Even better cuz they brought it out to me pretty quickly since I was in a bit of a rush to get to my sons basketball game.  Off to watch some basketball! For real tho, try this place. They have beer and wine too!"}
{"text":"I attended a special evening screening of a documentary the other week. Three menu options were offered for dinner, and I chose the black bean burrito/wrap. Portion size was about average; served with some blue corn chips and a small cup of salsa. I had high hopes, because there are few vegan/vegetarian options in Mesa.  Sadly, I was rather underwhelmed by my meal. The wrap was lacking any sauce and flavor. Where was the spicy tofu mayo or spices? The salsa was bland. Vegan doesn't have to mean boring. Perhaps the rest of the menu is better--this review is based completely on my one meal.  The place is new, bright, and clean. I could tell a lot of love had been put into its creation. Hoping for a few menu tweaks to jazz up some of their entrees. Maybe a toppings/sauce bar would help.  Pros: Menu descriptions sound appealing, Bright and clean, Friendly service Cons: A little pricey, Meal lacked flavor"}
{"text":"The first time my fiancé and I came here it was for a nut milk class. We tried different types of nut milks and vegan nut cheeses. They even gave us samples of their bread. I was impressed and wanted to come back and try more food.   Since the class I have been back twice. I have only tried the kale salad, the nutty butter sandwich, a date bar, the hummus plate, and a vanilla bean latte.   The vanilla bean latte is excellent!  I absolutely love it with coconut milk.   The kale salad was good. It was fresh and healthy but I prefer a different kale salad from another restaurant. The nutty butter sandwich was nice as well but the day that I tried it they had run out of banana. It was good but would've been better with the banana. The hummus plate had really nice fresh vegetables to dip the hummus in, and three different kinds of hummus. I liked it but I think the hummus could have been seasoned a little more. It was a bit bland for my taste.  I did not really care for the date bar. I appreciate that it was vegan and gluten-free, but the dates were very mushy and I did not like the texture. I would also like a little more flavoring in that as well.  Maybe more cinnamon or something to give it a little extra excitement.   I'm grateful there is another solid quality vegan gluten-free restaurant in the valley."}
{"text":"Loved the Vanilla Bean Latte and the Cinnamon Chocolate Cupcake!! I'm excited to try more things from the menu!"}
{"text":"This is probably the only vegan restaurant I have found in Mesa and it is amazing! It is definitely one of my favorite vegan restaurants I've ever been to so far. I came here with my sister and we order a few different items off of the menu to try. I ordered the Veg Head sand which with the regular hummus and it was absolutely to die for, I tried to remake it at home, but it was nothing compared to the one I ate here, so I guess I will just have to come back for more! We also ordered the soup of the day which was the Red Pepper Bisque, it was topped with basil and had a wonderful combination of flavor and I was pleasantly surprised to find quinoa in the bottom of the soup which I have never had before and thought it was an excellent touch. We also had the stuffed cremini mushrooms with walnut meat. The walnut meat is something I have never tried before or seen anywhere else. It was a great combination with the mushrooms. The service was also wonderful and everyone was attentive and friendly. Everything here was a 10/10 and we will definitely be back and recommending to everyone!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. I was excited to have the option of gluten free and vegan foods that I love, but it was disappointing. We waited 35 minutes for our cafe food and on top of that our order was messed up and they even forgot an item. I will not be going back here unfortunately."}
{"text":"Vegan yuminess from drinks, entree, and dessert! I had the pineapple mint lemonade, BLT wrap and Pinwheel cookies"}
{"text":"Mediocre place, food was okay--I got the breakfast burrito and iced coffee. Coffee also okay. Nothing really struck out to me as far as the \"wow\" factor. Smoothies are like 8 bucks?? That's expensive in my book!! I came back another time for coffee and i couldn't even drink it. One sip and I was done and had to throw the rest away. I do however want to try their pastries! Those look good"}
{"text":"Lemon Tajini Soup, mighty protein bowl and Veg Head soup was all delicious. A great spot for lunch, I order a head of time just in case they are running slow."}
{"text":"Yesterday I came in during lunch and the African American girl in the front was ridiculously rude. I love your food and I love coming in here to eat so much, but I've never had such terrible service there. I kept asking her questions about the food and she clearly had no idea what she was talking about. She rolled her eyes twice at me for no reason. I am seriously considering taking my money somewhere else because of her. She is so unwelcoming and the owner or manager needs to consider letting her go."}
{"text":"Friendly, great food and service. They have something going on most weekends that are generally great. I recommend any of the bowls and the roasted veggie sandwich to eat. They have great loose leaf teas also. I love that there's a healthy, organic place to eat on this side of the valley.   My only complaint would be: it gets really hot and is hard to find a good place to site in the evenings when the sun is setting, as the west side of the building is all glass."}
{"text":"Well, we walked in a little before 7:00 on a Wednesday night and there was no one at the counter and only a handful of customers either with food or waiting at tables. A good three minutes later someone in the back finally realized we were there and took our order - a cappuccino and a double espresso, that's it, no food. We were given a little identifying sign and sent to wait. Twenty minutes passed and we had to ask a staff member to check up on our coffee.  Finally got our drinks, with apologies and excuses. There was an offer for a free cupcake \"or something\", but we were trying to stop quick before meeting a friend for dinner. Had to drink and run, and were subsequently late.  The poor girl who was working the counter and fixed our drinks was getting shafted by her coworkers. The dining room had dirty tables, people were waiting, she was alone up front, and we could hear someone in the back already washing dishes and saw another employee walking around with her cell phone in hand.   Coffee was alright; better than I was fearing it would be, with all the chaos and delay. Doubt I'd come back."}
{"text":"This was our second time there and we enjoyed the food but unfortunately on this occasion we had really bad service. It was a pretty busy Sunday afternoon so we figured we would be waiting a while to get our food. We placed our order and waited patiently. After 50 minutes of waiting we checked on our order and was told it never got sent back to the kitchen. The owners response was \" sorry, sometimes that happens\".  We waited an additional 15 min and then got our food. Most business in this situation would have offered some sort of coupon of your next visit or maybe a free drink. Not that I'm looking for a hand out but it just seemed like none of the 5 employees really cared about customer service. It's too bad we had this experience."}
{"text":"Very yummy innovative vegetarian meals here. Staff is always super nice. I think they hold cooking classes too sometimes."}
{"text":"I wanted to check this place out as a healthier option for brunch. Score! They have vegan, gluten free, organic, whatever your diet needs you can get it here. My wife and I shared a smoothie and a light snack of sprouted grain bread with mashed avocado or almond butter, and a small bowel of fruit. The food was good quality and the price was reasonable. After reviewing the menu, we'll be back to try more items. We also got a check in offer when we checked in on Yelp. Now I can also try the lemon aide free."}
{"text":"I am giving 5 stars solely on the restaurant concept and the menu!  I will update this review after I have dined here.  I discovered the restaurant accidentally when I arrived early for an appointment nearby and needed to kill an hour.  I had an excellent latte and a delicious GF date and oatmeal bar."}
{"text":"I've only gotten coffee here, so I don't have a whole lot to say. My boyfriend lives in Gilbert, which, to me, is chain central. I was happy to see the sign for a grand opening, and a name I didn't know.  It's cute inside. The decor is modern. The staff (I think they are the owners) were super friendly. My request for an ice cube in my coffee didn't cause them to bat an eye, like at some places.  I will definitely eat here next time I go in. The menu looked fresh, and i believe everything is vegetarian."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in years as it isn't on my side of town but am so glad I stopped by! Speedy and friendly service and everything is vegan, which is always a relief. Wonderful, unprocessed whole food options! I loved my Protein Bowl with really generous avocado and my boyfriend enjoyed his Black Bean Burger (minus jalapeños) with baked fries. Their pastries looked delightful and the tea was super tasty -- plus it was free with yelp check in! Yum! East valley peeps, get on it."}
{"text":"Really delicious food. Wonderful service. And healthful to boot!  I had the Soul-Full bowl (lentils, quinoa, tahini, avocado, greens, hot sauce) and my mom had the Hearty bowl (brown rice, hummus, sweet potatoes, zucchini, squash, greens, lime-cumin vinaigrette). They were delicious and I felt so healthy! And satisfied. Very good portions. We also had a Watermelon Cooler Juice... Yum!  The husband from the husband/wife owner team was there to take our orders and he was so kind and helpful!  We will be back! Everyone needs to go support this wonderful veg eatery - you won't be sorry :)"}
{"text":"Usually vegan cuisine isn't my bag, but my brother and sister-in-law are vegans and they were ordering some take-out lunch, so I decided to give it a try.    When we walked in to pick up our food, I instantly regretted not dining in.  The dining room had a sophisiticated, modern cool feel to it.  I saw a guy eating a plate of bruschetta, which looked fresh and out of this world good, and made a mental note to try it next time.  The dishes I saw were all beautifully presented.  I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the Protein Bowl.  It was basically a mixed greens salad loaded up with quinoa, walnut meats and some avocado.  The bowl came with a couple different kinds of fresh salsa.  I was a little concerned that I wouldn't feel full without a little meat or cheese, but the dish was actually quite satisfying.  My only complaint was that the avocado portion was skimpy.  If you're an avocado lover like me, considering ordering an extra side.  While I don't think I'll be going vegan anytime soon, I'm happy we found a restaurant in Mesa that vegans and omivores alike can enjoy.  Hats off to the Cutting Board for serving up fresh, tasty and appealing food in a nice setting!"}
{"text":"Cute little vegan cafe. I ordered the bruschetta board with herbed tofu and French onion soup. My boyfriend ordered a pizza. While the bruschetta board's presentation was beautiful, the food left me feeling a bit unsatisfied. The herbed tofu was overwhelmingly salty and they drizzled way too much balsamic vinegar over the bruschetta to the point that it was almost drenching in it. The French onion soup fortunately was less overpowering in its flavor and the pizza was also good. Overall, the food was decent, but nothing special that would compel me to make the trip out here."}
{"text":"My parents and I decided to try this place for the first time and we loved it!  I had the burrito and loved the salsa and the hot sauce.  My mom had the grilled veggie sandwich and said they were fresh and crispy veggies and the bread was delicious.  And Dad loved his Greek pita gyro.  And their iced tea is TO DIE FOR!  Yes, I am willing to judge a restaurant solely based on their iced tea, but in this case I didn't need to.  The food was delicious and reasonably priced and the service was great.  If you are ever in the area, you should try it.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"I really love this place, everything is fresh and healthy & made with a lot of love! They serve Local, Organic, Vegan, Vegetarian dishes. They serve coffee too! I always feel great after going here! Keep up the great work guys!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! the food was so great! My friend and I both had delicious salads. I had a pressed juice and it was great. If you are looking for something healthy and delicious I would highly recommend this place! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I can't overstate how wonderful this place is. Finally a vegan cafe in the Mesa/Gilbert area! Coffee, fresh juices and smoothies, organic local veggie cuisine, and a beautiful modern atmosphere. This place is a real gem."}
{"text":"Don't have organic juices. Can't guarantee that ingredients are organic. We're not super helpful. If you are going to make juice why waste you time and not make it organic? Who wants to drink pesticides?"}
{"text":"This place is just beyond hope at this point. They now cannot even properly make the couple of good (but very expensive) things they had on the menu.  The tofu sandwich which they have for brunch was pretty much the only thing they had that was consistently good. Got today and it's totally different, without warning. Sourdough sliced bread is different and this time not toasted and not cut in half.  Looks like a sandwich a 5 year old slapped together. But somehow still took them 30 minutes to make it. Tofu not marinated like it usually is, and instead of avocado slices I get straight up guacamole...in a tofu sandwich...doesn't match and tastes disgusting. Can't even finish it. Ruined my breakfast."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to eat and hang out! We have been regulars since they opened and will continue to come because the food is so awesome and they always add new and interesting specials and desserts. We recommend this place to all our friends!"}
{"text":"If you're not a vegan or a foodie, it's hard to find something good to eat here. I was here for a comedy show, so I'll give it an extra star for the entertainment value. The place has a great feel to it. They have a few decent beers, friendly staff."}
{"text":"I went there for coffee in the morning and after looking at the menu came back for dinner with my whole family. This is the perfect place to be full after eating but not the gross-feeling-food-coma type of way.  Delicious food! I stared at the menu for about 10 minutes not being able to decide because everything looked so appetizing. Even my meat and potatoes Dad ate his entire meal.  The owner introduced himself and explained the concept behind The Cutting Board and even told us about how he bakes fresh cinnamon rolls with orange zest on Saturday morning. Can you guess where I'm headed to this morning at 8am?"}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday morning at 9am hoping to beat the rush and we essentially did, however it did take some time to put in the order and get the food.  I understand the atmosphere and the food is really good with sourcing of local sources so for me, I don't mind waiting a little bit based on those criteria.  I just wouldn't come here if I needed something quick, but if you are meeting friends and need a place with good food that allows you to talk to your friends, this is a great place"}
