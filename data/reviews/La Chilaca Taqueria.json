{"text":"Best taco I've ever had!!! Tried the new Campechano taco and I'm hooked. Staff are very friendly. Portion was big and only $5. Will definitely be back and highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"What a little hole in the wall gem tucked in the middle of Kensington Market! We stumbled upon this place because Seven Lives is cash only. Such a pleasant surprise. 

The setup was confusing, because there are multiple food stalls all within this building, but you pay separately. This place doesn't have chips and salsa, so you would have to buy from the vendors across from them. Weather permits, sit outside. Table seating in the back is meh. 

I got one Chilaca taco and one chicken taco for $10 total. They are huugggeee stuffed to the brim with meat and toppings. The Chilaca has a Chilaca pepper wrapped around the outside of one of the shells (did I say Chilaca enough?). Incredible. 

Salsa bar is self-serve, homemade in house. Apart from the green mild jalapeño salsa, they all have quite the kick. I've been to Mexico several times and have had a lot of tacos, but I can wholeheartedly say that these are some of the best. Best get some napkins before you sit down. 

This place is going to explode on the Toronto food scene. Watch out, these tacos will rock your world."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price. The meat tastes authentic and is plentiful. I'd love it if I could add rice to the burritos but they don't offer rice as of now. Regardless the burritos are really delicious and worth your money. Give them a try!"}
{"text":"Found my go to place for tacos hidden away in the back of Pancho's at Kensington. It's definitely authentic, filling and more economical than Seven Lives. They just added chicken to their menu & it's good, better than the pastor I think. There's seating at the back (inside & outside patio) and facilities on the premise. I can't tell you how delicious their tacos were. You'll just have to try it out for yourself. The tacos were overflowing and your hands will get messy but there's a hand washing station available and plenty of nappies."}
{"text":"The dynamic duo working here impress me with their food, attitude and zest for cooking up tacos and burritos. These are solid lunch items, guaranteed to keep you going through your day, not some cutesy bar snack. A nice big chunk of fish, lean and well-seasoned chorizo, and pastor full of flavour these double shelled tacos are bursting out of the tray which barely holds the two of them.
The sauces are a must-try! You need to go alongside the counter and grab a plastic cup to take to your seat at the back of this incredible culinary experience of a food court. There are three sauces and they are all worth a taste.
I need to come back to try one of their burritos, if the tacos are any indication, the burrito will be the best I've ever tried, and blow everything else out of the Mexi-To landscape."}
{"text":"Fantastic! My wife and I were visiting from California (the capital of amazing Mexican food) and this was one of the best tacos we ever had. Salsas are also incredible...do yourself a favor and have a taste of Mexico!"}
{"text":"There seem to be so many great options in this area and even in this building that it's hard to say what to get. We just had a taste for tacos so we went for it. They were piping hot and each was pretty fantastic. Although the asada and chorizo were great it was the carnitas that stole the show! In fact, I'd probably opt to get only carnitas on my next visit!"}
{"text":"Excellent tacos and service. They make a cilantro salsa, it's behind the counter, so ask for it!"}
{"text":"These guys are great, affordable, they let you mix & match your tacos (unlike most places), and their back patio area is really charming. Give them your money so they can grow!"}
{"text":"Very fresh, and authentic tasting food. Great price for the quality you're getting. Can see it being made in front of you, too!"}
{"text":"Other Yelp reviews - and mostly their drool-worthy photos - made me want to try this place. My biggest pet peeve about tacos I've tried in this town is that the tortillas are dry, cold and crumbly. From the photos, there was real hope that this place did their tortillas up right. I ordered the special - these two enormous Al Pastor tacos for $5. They hit the spot and I appreciated the attention paid to everything - the tortillas definitely saw some grease from the grill, the meat was hot, cilantro, onions, pineapple was fresh and nicely cut, and they were more than generous with the ingredients.

It's easy to miss this place as it's a little counter at the back of a place in Kensington Market that houses a few other food stalls (the churros ice cream cone counter faces the street - walk past and head to the back, right side). Several orders went in around the same time as ours, so it was a bit unclear whether we should wait near the grill (this is where the molcajete bowls are with the salsas) or sit down and wait at the tables at the back, or whether we should pay when we ordered or wait until after... just go with the flow and I promise it will all work out!!

We sat down and one of the grill guys brought our order over, along with 3 little plastic cups of each of the sauces. I didn't see a shawarma-style spit here, so not sure how they prepare their meat before giving it a go on the grill. I thought these tacos might stand out a touch more if the marinade was more distinctive or if the cut was a little juicier/fattier.

As it stands, I'd definitely come back to have these again and try some other kinds. The young staff all seemed super friendly and eager to make a go of this place. It deserves your support!!!"}
{"text":"Meh.. first couple of bites were good but then once again due to the aggressive stuffing of their tacos, they fell apart and were a complete mess. Best thing about these tacos is that they put some char on the tortillas but after that I wasn't impressed. 
I had Carnitas, Fish and Shrimp and nothing was that memorable.
Real Carnitas have a beautiful note of citrus and should have some caramelization which these didn't.
The shrimp and fish were very bland, I much prefer Seven Lives shrimp taco. The fish was grilled and the first thing that hit me was the abundance of salt.
El Nahual kills this place."}
{"text":"Ordered the 4 for $10 chorizo tacos. I am very concerned at the moment. I hope the Dead Sea is okay considering the fact that they practically drained all the salt out and put it in my tacos. The portions are good but damn, it's saltier than my personality. If you face high blood pressure, please prepare to call an ambulance. Please."}
{"text":"I found this establishment after looking for places to eat around the Kensington market area. I had the beef burrito and a bottle of jarrito's. 

The flavor they can get out of the beef was, well, perfect. It really hits you after the first bite. I wouldn't mind it if they added rice to the burrito as well but it's not enough of a concern to change my grade. The flavor was just too good."}
{"text":"This place was amazing and such a hidden gem. 

VERY FLAVOURFUL & ALMOST ALL ARE HOME MADE: Their sauces and meat flavour are amazing! They make everything in house, including the chorizo. The only thing they don't make by hand, but is equally delicious, is their corn tortilla. They source them from a supplier. The sauces are soooo good, make sure to take extra. 

GENEROUS PORTIONS & VALUE: For $3-5 per taco and $8 for burrito, plus their 2 for $5 daily deal on taco's... Amazing. Portion sizes are generous, it will fill you up.  

SERVICE: The people are so nice and kind! If you sit at the patio or dining area in the back, they'll bring your food for you when it's ready."}
{"text":"After Seven Lives, this was such an amazing deal. Well, even without thinking about Seven Lives, this is still an amazing deal. One of their daily specials (do these actually change?) was 4 chorizo tacos for $10. That's including tax. These chorizo tacos are loaded with a lot of meat and a generous amount of cilantro and perhaps onions and then you can put one of three homemade sauces on it, and they also have grilled sweet peppers that are self serve. Absolute magic. 

I had my taco with their mild sauce, which is green and creamy. I don't like cilantro, and these tacos had a lot of cilantro on them, but the cilantro helped cut down the greasy feeling from the chorizo. Greasy in a good way. This is no frills tacos at their best. Amazing. If this were closer to home, I'd come all the time."}
{"text":"The tacos were amazingly flavoured with huge portions.  Each taco was so generously filled and really affordable too--esp for what you got. The customer service was great too. Really enjoyed my meal here."}
{"text":"One of the best tacos in the city. 1 taco is more than enough, given the portion, for 5 $, delicious and house made ingredients (recommendation: La chilaca Taco with their house made chorizo and top it with the 3 hot sauces). 
Also, staff is very friendly and dynamic. Filling portions, and yummy - Definitely a place to check out. Here's a preview of you might get there :)

{"text":"Authentic tacos in Toronto!

No need to fly down to Mexico anymore!

Okay, there are still tons of reasons to go to Mexico but at least I don't have to go just to satisfy my craving for authentic tacos. I've been to Mexico City 3 times and Oaxaca 1 time. Never to the touristy beach cities. My passion for Mexico is fueled by its food and museums. World class.

La Chilaca has a counter inside a building which could be nicknamed \"Minute Mexico\" (as in tiny, not as in fast). Other vendors make churros, pupusas etc but I'm there for the tacos. Loved the chorizo taco and the Campechano (mixed meats). Had a bite of son's al pastor. He says it tastes just like the ones in Mexico City. True, and at least we had table service and didn't have to stand on the street lol. Yes, we have eaten at some rough, local places in el D.F.

You order your food and go to the back where there are a few tables near a parking area. Graffiti on the neighbour's wall. It's not a pretty brunch patio."}
{"text":"Tacos made fresh in front of your eyes. Good portion of meat and veggies. Everything comes together very well and great bang for your buck. The salsa and chips is also fresh and full of flavour. Can't wait to try other items next time."}
{"text":"A decent place to get tacos and burritos. Ordered a veg taco, a shrimp taco, and a veggie burrito. The tacos were a bit soggy and bland; would have preferred if they were hard/semi-hard and spicier. The hot sauce made up for the low spice levels. The burrito was standard. However, the tofu in veggie taco and burrito was not as dry as I would have liked (I should have specified my preference while ordering!)

The price point is good and I would love to try other items on the menu (will revisit this review then)"}
{"text":"I went by this little restaurant on a weekend before work and decided to get a fish taco. It tasted absolutely amazing, and I'm wanting to go back for more. The service was very fast and I'm very impressed overall"}
{"text":"To start, this place is a dive so set your expectations accordingly. The tables, walls and washrooms could all use a wipe down.

There is a reason people come here and it has to be because the food is so delicious and it is cheap. We ordered a shrimp and steak taco with a couple of jaritos. We then turned around to the kiosk across from the tacos and ordered the chips and guacamole.

The guacamole was fresh and full of chunky tomatoes. Yummy. The tacos were so full of flavour! Unfortunately in the 60 seconds we had to be in the washroom, they cleared our table, but still didn't wipe it down, so my kid was annoyed as she had only eaten half her taco and drink and we had not finished the guacamole either. I guess when you have to go you risk the consequences.

I recommend getting takeout at this place for the best experience."}
{"text":"Continuing our downtown food tour we decided to try the La Chilaca Taqueria in the El Gordo complex in Kensington.

Didn't know at the time but the building houses several food stalls and this was the place where Seven Lives Tacos got there start before they exploded on the scene.

The tacos here were delicious!  For $5 you get a specialty taco and for $3 you get a basic taco but they are all fantastic!  Double wrapped, stuffed with protein of your choice and freshly made in house salsas to drown your tacos in.  There is some serious value here folks!

I'm not an authentic Mexican food expert but these tacos are probably more traditional ones then the Baja California ones at Seven Lives.  

Which one is better?   F*ck me man don't ask me that!! Its kinda like that movie \"Sophie's Choice\", which child do you choose?  I love them both but in different ways!!

Its a small set up as only 2 guys work with one doing all the cooking and one helping out.  They are really nice and deserve all the success given to them.  Will be back!

5/5!"}
{"text":"I was meeting a friend for lunch in Kensington when he exclaimed, \"are you ready for the best taco of your life?!\" I replied \"oh seven lives right?\" thinking of the tacos I had enjoyed at that establishment before. The answer was a big fat no. Nope. Not seven lives. 
Off we went to a hidden little grill behind panchos. I instantly loved the two staff; adorably friendly and helpful. My friend told me the shrimp was his go to, but I fared for the carnitas and pork to see what they were all about. They make their salsas fresh and every day, out on display at the counter, so we loaded up and headed out to eat in the sun. 
I was absolutely blown away. 
Truly.
Having been to Mexico and LA and all over California loving the tacos I had eaten there, it takes a lot to impress me taco-wise. 
The meat was so tender and flavourful, the tortilla is crispy and double layered, not falling apart or dry like other places. They really stuff it too, none of those measly little portions at other spots in the city. 
I love the cilantro they added and the flavour of the medium and mild sauces. 
I'm one thousand percent showing these incredible tacos to my friends! 
Can't wait to try more items on the menu a million times over"}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 4/5
This place is located at Augusta Ave and Nassau St inside a building with a bunch of small Mexican/Spanish vendors. 

[SERVICE] - 4/5
The cashier was friendly and helpful as she answered our questions about the menu. 

[DÉCOR] - 3/5 
Seating area inside is limited, but there is more room on the patio (open during the warm season). 

[QUALITY] - 3/5
Tortilla and toppings were fresh. However, the pork was a little dry without the sauce. 

[ORDER] - 4/5
- Pastor Tacos - 2 for $5.00: comes with marinated pork, topped with fresh onion and pineapple in a small flour tortilla. Meat was very well-seasoned. You can also add the delicious green mild sauce, red spicy sauce, cucumbers, and mango salad to enhance the flavours! 

[OVERALL] - 4/5
For $5.00, you actually get a lot of food! The combination of spices, sauces, and fresh ingredients complement the Pastor very well. I would definitely recommend this place for their tacos!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Two overflowing tacos for $5. 
Made fresh right in front of you and worth the wait. 
I had one chorizo & one steak. The steak was a bit bland but the chorizo was ridiculously good. 
I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Located at the back of the El Gordo complex in Kensington Market is a little hole in the wall you will not want to miss. La Chilaca Taqueria serves up authentic delicious Mexican cuisine at a price point that will knock your socks off!

I ended up trying their daily special (two Pastor Tacos for $5.00) and was thoroughly impressed. First of all, these things are huge (similar to the ones at Seven Lives). They have a crisp, grilled double layered corn tortilla which was absolutely delicious - soft, pliable and surprisingly light with just a hint of sweetness and a slight charred flavour. What really amazed me was that the tortilla held together even with all the filling inside it!

The inside of the tortilla is stuffed with a generous amount of delicious, tender marinated pork which was then topped with fresh onions, pineapple and cilantro. I loved how the sweet juicy pineapples added a vibrant summertime feel to the well-seasoned meat and the cilantro complimented everything with a light citrusy and peppery overtone. I squeezed on a splash of lime for a bit more of a sweet citrus kick. And then added on some of the red spicy sauce to enhance the flavours (although in retrospect, I should have probably gone with the green mild sauce instead). Definitely a taco you won't want to miss!"}
{"text":"My new favourite taco joint in the city! This hole-in-the-wall eatery is a newish addition to the El Gordo food building in Kensington Market. The chef that runs this place hails from Guanajuato, Mexico, and he brought the authentic taco cuisine from there along with him.

First order of business is to address how amazing the food is here for the price that you pay. Their daily special gets you two AL Pastor tacos for a mere $5 (tax included). These things are huge (comparable to Seven Lives) and stuffed with meat! And they taste amazing too, as all their toppings and salsas are made fresh daily! The authenticity of the food is obvious once you bite into the crispily grilled (double layered of course) tortillas of these tacos. Seriously one of the best Al Pastor tacos I've had in Toronto, and for a price that is downright extinct in this day of age.

Speaking of their salsas, these things are made in house and are some of the best salsas I have ever tasted in a taco! They make 3 salsas of varying spice levels, but my favourite one is definitely their mild green one. Made from jalapeños (without the seeds), this salsa has a rich citric flavour that pairs perfectly with their tacos-a must try regardless of what spice level you prefer =)

I've been here about 7 times now and have had the opportunity to try most of their taco offerings. All of their tacos are either $5 for specialty and/or seafood/chicken ones, or $3 for more common meat ones (chorizo, carnitas, etc). Quite frankly, all the options are great and you really get your money's worth here. I look forward to trying out their burritos next time (which also look bomb). 

The El Gordo food building is a food court type eatery that has tables in the back for patrons. If the weather is nice, you could sit outside in the back patio as well. They will happily bring you your food when it's ready-great customer service for such a small establishment! Don't be afraid to get your hands dirty while eating these tacos as well (good luck keeping all the meat from falling out), as there is a washroom and a hand washing station here for you to use afterwards. 

Overall, an amazing place to get some authentic Mexican tacos without having to empty your wallet. Seven Lives started out as a food stall here as well, and I can see La Chilaca having the same kind of success in the near future. Get your taco fix here quick before it blows up ;) 

Final tip: they only accept cash now and sometimes sell out before the end of the day on weekends!"}
