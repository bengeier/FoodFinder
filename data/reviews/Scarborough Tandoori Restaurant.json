{"text":"Very good food but a bit more expensive than other local indian restaurants. Good veggie selection and well spices food. If you ask for extra spice they definitely take you seriously so be warned"}
{"text":"Decent Indian restaurant - nothing spectacular, but nothing to compain about either. Nice wine selection, tasty food, good service."}

{"text":"I visited the Scarborough Tandoori with my partner earlier on this month. We had spent most of the day in the pouring rain and our hotel had no heating so we decided to venture out for something to eat and to warm up. The restaurant is modestly decorated and the atmosphere is really nice. Staff were very welcoming and the service was excellent.  The food was absolutely delicious, perfectly cooked and very generously portioned. We were also given complimentary drinks with the bill which was a really nice touch. My advice to the Scarborough Tandoori is  keep doing what you're doing, customer service and food were both excellent."}
{"text":"You'll be hard pushed to find a friendlier establishment than this. The sweet chilli dip which is served with the pickle tray is *the* best I have ever had anywhere. Everyone I have ever taken there has always come away very satisfied. Whether you like Kormas, the house speciality Balti or the more potent main courses you'll find quality food here every time. Highly Recommended."}
{"text":"Another solid and quite decent restaurant which we've used on several occasions in the past for corporate bookings.    Its not the biggest place in the world - the downstairs area is the main restaurant, and theres a fucnction room upstairs for private bookings (which is free to hire) but its tastefully, but unspectacularly, decorated. The menu choices are varied and theres probably something to choose for everyone. Its also very reasonably priced, both for group rates (a party of 15 of us paid just over Â£10 for three courses) and individual rates.    The food itself is always very nice. I'm not a huge fan of Indian as a rule, but I always enjoy eating here whenever we do. Some of the hotter dishes are so hot your head may burst into flames, but there are plenty of milder dishes to choose from if thats not your thing. The wine list is adequate and theres a range of beers, soft drinks and so on to choose from at the bar too.    Its a family run place, and service is always very good. Recommended."}
{"text":"Never eaten at the restaurant but have had many takeaways from here. I can honestly say it is the most delicious indian food i have ever tasted!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff - standard food. Unfortunately as it is the oldest Indian in town it appears to have gone into a rut of complacency. Whilst I heartily recommend it for a standard curry their is nothing startling about it. The Handi Buhna is well worth a try and you can order it to whatever heat level you wish. The rest of it though is as you would get anywhere else. Nothing bad but nothing special"}
{"text":"Great restaurant with awesome Indian and southern Asian cuisine. There are many options to choose from. Great restaurant for a business dinner or date night. Tandoori chicken, chicken chilli Marsala were excellent. Great wait staff and more than ample bar."}
