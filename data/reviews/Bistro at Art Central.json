{"text":"Shrimp was past due and tasted off. 

Tried this bistro out before a concert. Not impressed. The restaurant was empty at 7pm which should have been my first clue. 

Prices were reasonable and the menu has some interesting choices. Ordered the prawn risotto. The risotto itself was ok if a little salty. The prawns though were clearly past due and were totally lacking in any sauce or garnish. 

Overall, won't be back. It is a shame since it's prime location just screams out for a quick and delicious restaurant on the way home after a long day of work downtown"}
{"text":"I used to eat regularly at The Siding Cafe before it turned into The Bistro, but I've only eaten at The Bistro about 3 times since it was re-vamped. For me, The Bistro is overpriced for what you get. I like the idea of it, but the food is nothing special... and it's difficult to eat there for under $12 - which is my maximum budget for lunches.

The last item I ordered was the Bison Burger with fries, and the burger was tasteless to me. It had some sort of jam on it instead BBQ sauce but by the end of my meal, I felt like I had a stomach full of bland hamburger. Definitely not an experience I'd like to have a second time.

Their salmon BLT sandwich is tasty, but expensive. I think it was around $14 and it is served on a wooden cutting board. 

This restaurant is located in the trendy Art Central building right on 7th ave and Center street. I noticed that they used to have original artwork in the restaurant, but now they have some generic, ugly mass-produced poster prints on their walls. Why would a restaurant in Art Central not ask their tenant artists to put up original artwork? There are so many galleries and studios in the building that could use the cross-promotion. Beats me.

I've heard their breakfasts were good, but lately they've only been opening at 10 am or so. Their business hours are often unreliable. You never know when this place will change."}
{"text":"This place has an eclectic enough menu to be in the Art Central building but the prices are insane for what you get. It was much better when it was the Siding Cafe and closely tied to the coffee shop upstairs.  Even the waitresses don't seem interested there now."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today with my colleagues.  The food was good and decently priced.  12-18 dollars for lunch entrees.

The service was very poor however.  The waiter was very reluctant to divide the bill for us and literally threw the receipt at me after we paid.  We didn't act in any way to warrant this behavior and were courteous to our waiter. 

Despite this restaurant being very close to my workplace, because of this I will never return."}
{"text":"Decided to try Bistro at Art Central 'cos the restaurant was part of the American Express Dine Out Calgary.  The special lunch menu consisted of choice of soup or salad, lobster quiche and your choice of fries, soup or salad.  All for $15!  So reasonable.  

We got our food quickly and it wasn't too bad.  The soup of the day was Beef Vegetable - a little on the salty side.  My lobster quiche came with mixed greens and a tangy citrus balsamic dressing.  All in all - not too bad.

I like the location, right on the C-Train tracks.  So convenient! 

Might want to come back and try other dishes.  Dishes were passing me by and they all looked good."}
